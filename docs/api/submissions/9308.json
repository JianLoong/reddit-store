Her ex had shared custody.  I had a couple of grown children from my first wife.  \n\nMy stepson Charlie and I never really bonded.  He had a father and he made it clear I wasn't his parent just his mom's husband.  I respected this, he was always polite and respectful, just distant.  \n\nI helped pay for his university when he went and we attended his graduation.  When he got married our invitation was made out to his mother plus one.  That was kind of a slap in the face but we still attended and gave them a substantial cash gift to start their life.  The thank you card didn't have my name on it.  \n\nMy first wife had passed away from.cancer and it broke me.  I didn't want to go through that again. Her youth was one thing that attracted me to my second wife. I know it was selfish.  But I liked having a beautiful young wife to take care of and she liked me well enough. I didn't realize how much I loved her until she died. She passed away from a stroke. She was 49.  \n\nCharlie came to the funeral with his family. His wife whom I had only met at the wedding and his kids. We had known he had kids but he had never made the effort to bring them for a visit.  My wife loved the kids but Charlie wouldn't make the effort to come see us.  \n\nMy wife only had a very small estate and she left it all to Charlie. He also took almost everything of sentimental value that she owned before we got married.  I didn't begrudge him any of it. \n\nMy first grandchild just graduated cum laude last year  and I went to his graduation. My son and his wife have worked hard to get their kids into college and I am proud of them. My son mentioned that my grandson had a job waiting and would be debt free pretty quick.  I asked how much he owed.  Then I wrote him a check to pay it off.  I plan to do this for all my grandchildren.   \n\nI guess my daughter-in-law and my stepson's wife are Facebook friends or something.  He found out what I did.  And he came around to ask if I planned to do the same for his children.  \n\nI don't really have any connections to his kids.  I don't see them. They don't consider me their grandfather. I've personally only ever seen them at the funeral.  I was really put off by him coming by to ask about money after ignoring me for years.  I know that if my wife were alive she would want me to help out her son. It just felt dirty. \n\nI said that I had money for them in my will and if they needed it for university I would give it to them early. \n\nHe said I'm a petty little man and that his mom would be ashamed of me for treating his kids like this.  \n\nI don't really think I owe them anything.  They have a \"real\" grandfather.  I'm only including them in my will for my wife's sake.  \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1675717226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vi1cx/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_that_his_kids_werent/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His mom is probably shaking her head up above", "NTA I will never understand why some people think it is appropriate to treat their stepparents as if they do not exist but expect them to act as ATM's or personal bank accounts when it is convenient. He has no right to ask for the money in the first place.", "NTA...He chose what kind of relationship he wished to have with you. It's time for him to accept the consequences and outcome of those decisions.", "NTA, they're using you exactly as what you apparently have been to your stepson all his life - a cash cow.", "NTA\n\nLiterally the only reason stepson is trying to play this game is because there\u2019s money on the table now.  Tell your stepson to pound sand.", "NTA.  I'm very sorry for your loss.  I lost my fiancee when she was 27 and it still hurts almost 20 years later.  It sucks that you never developed a better relationship with your stepson.  It is kind of you to include his children in your will. It is also kind of you to offer this money early if they need it for school.  Your wife would be proud of you for not being taken advantage of by someone who only wants to use you.", "NTA. It's your money to do with as you please, and the fact that he asked and not his children shows the lack of relationship and makes your stance reasonable", "You were never his stepfather, just his mother's husband.  To address you as his mother's +1 is just nasty. He received an inheritance from his mother and will receive one from his father. He is the petty little man,  not you. You owe him and his children nothing.
