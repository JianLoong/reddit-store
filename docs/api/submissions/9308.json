Her ex had shared custody.  I had a couple of grown children from my first wife.  \n\nMy stepson Charlie and I never really bonded.  He had a father and he made it clear I wasn't his parent just his mom's husband.  I respected this, he was always polite and respectful, just distant.  \n\nI helped pay for his university when he went and we attended his graduation.  When he got married our invitation was made out to his mother plus one.  That was kind of a slap in the face but we still attended and gave them a substantial cash gift to start their life.  The thank you card didn't have my name on it.  \n\nMy first wife had passed away from.cancer and it broke me.  I didn't want to go through that again. Her youth was one thing that attracted me to my second wife. I know it was selfish.  But I liked having a beautiful young wife to take care of and she liked me well enough. I didn't realize how much I loved her until she died. She passed away from a stroke. She was 49.  \n\nCharlie came to the funeral with his family. His wife whom I had only met at the wedding and his kids. We had known he had kids but he had never made the effort to bring them for a visit.  My wife loved the kids but Charlie wouldn't make the effort to come see us.  \n\nMy wife only had a very small estate and she left it all to Charlie. He also took almost everything of sentimental value that she owned before we got married.  I didn't begrudge him any of it. \n\nMy first grandchild just graduated cum laude last year  and I went to his graduation. My son and his wife have worked hard to get their kids into college and I am proud of them. My son mentioned that my grandson had a job waiting and would be debt free pretty quick.  I asked how much he owed.  Then I wrote him a check to pay it off.  I plan to do this for all my grandchildren.   \n\nI guess my daughter-in-law and my stepson's wife are Facebook friends or something.  He found out what I did.  And he came around to ask if I planned to do the same for his children.  \n\nI don't really have any connections to his kids.  I don't see them. They don't consider me their grandfather. I've personally only ever seen them at the funeral.  I was really put off by him coming by to ask about money after ignoring me for years.  I know that if my wife were alive she would want me to help out her son. It just felt dirty. \n\nI said that I had money for them in my will and if they needed it for university I would give it to them early. \n\nHe said I'm a petty little man and that his mom would be ashamed of me for treating his kids like this.  \n\nI don't really think I owe them anything.  They have a \"real\" grandfather.

First, you raised the kids - yours and hers and you don\u2019t owe them anything further.  You can choose to do whatever you like with your money.  If one of my kids or step kids came to me like that I would give them nothing.  \n\nFunny story in the same topic.  My son went to university quite a ways away from me.  I was paying his tuition, car, insurance and a small allowance.  If he went too long without coming to see us I would tell him the next check would not be sent.  Worked wonderfully.  As an adult now he comes home to see us a couple times a year for a week or more at a time.  \n\nAnyway - NTA.  I\u2019m truly sorry you have been put in this situation.

If your wife left your kids nothing it would be equitable ti do the same.", "NTA- He's an entitled AH and honestly they dont need to be in your will either your wife has passed on and if she were alive, she would probably be ashamed of her son and his crappy attitude and entitlement.

I find it so sad and embarrassing how people act when money becomes apparent to them and affects their relationships. Your wife's son made it crystal clear how he saw you... actually, he went to great lengths to demonstrate to you that his mother's choice to marry you did not equate to any desire for an emotional connection on his end.

He has forgotten the face of his father.", "NTA. But your step son sure is. Good on you for not taking that out on his kids. You are not obligated to do anything and frankly if he continues to treat you this way, I wouldn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s completely disgusting that he access way. I\u2019m giving random money to children you don\u2019t even know?  Even your late wife would not expect this. Trust me. She would be sad that her son has treated you so poorly. It\u2019s OK to just take care of the people that you have relationships with. \n\nDo what you need to do even if that means leaving your money to a charity.

Don't feel guilty. This isn't your fault. Your stepson is entitled and greedy. He doesn't care about you, only what you can do for him.", "NTA\n\nNo you owe them nothing, I would not even include them in your will.

You can give money to whomever your heart wants! \nHow about involving you in the kids\u2019 life before asking for money?

It\u2019s ok for Charlie to not really want a relationship but to then suddenly expect the same treatment as OPs children who are actively in his life is not ok, he can\u2019t have it both ways.

You're continuing to honor the love for your wife by making sure her grandkids will have a good future. A lot of people in the thread don't seem to like that, but I understand. If you do give them money, I would say that it go directly to them at 18 and not to pass it through your stepson's hands. Him coming to grub money from you after hearing someone else got something is just so disrespectful and tacky, especially after never giving you a chance. How can he feel no shame for that? It astounds me.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. Just don't let your love for your wife turn you into a doormat for them. They already inherited her whole estate. To give them anything else is outstandingly generous and your step son should be grateful.", "Yes, she may have felt that way.

If you are feeling internal conflict about what to do, I think you can talk to him more about it. Not because you owe him a single thing, but because you might feel more peace with the decision? He has made it clear his whole life he did not want you to treat him like your other kids, and you have respected and followed his lead on that. So it's a total surprise to now have him upset you're continuing to do that.

OP is being far more than reasonable by even including Charlie's children in his own will.", "I would also add that stepson wasn't very kind to his own mother.  He alienated himself and his wife/kids so that his Mum wasn't able to have a relationship with them.  I think OP is being generous beyond expectations with his Will arrangements.  Stepson is entitled and selfish, not only for asking for money but for the way he treated his Mum when she was alive.  There is no mention of acrimony between stepson and his Mum so I'm assuming it was all on his side.  Seems like he doesn't like OP and was punishing his Mum, even the wedding invite was a slap in the face.  Entitled and insecure.", "Yup.\n\nOP, my grandparents had their estate held in trust for the grandkids until age 30. He wanted to make sure none of his children were able to get any of it. There was a stipulation that allowed it to be distributed early for educational/medical expenses directly paid to the school/medical facility. One of my cousins used his that way.

Not his step son. And he can even put it in a trust and have one of his children or a lawyer oversee the trust until the kids are 25 or 30  or another arbitrary but adult age.", "I think he's bypassing the stepson and just leaving stuff for the grandkids and that's why stepson is actually mad. The kids are in elementary school and stepson just wants the money now. Those kids won't see a penny of it unless OP leaves it in trust for them, which I hope he does."]}
