Her ex had shared custody.  I had a couple of grown children from my first wife.  \n\nMy stepson Charlie and I never really bonded.  He had a father and he made it clear I wasn't his parent just his mom's husband.  I respected this, he was always polite and respectful, just distant.  \n\nI helped pay for his university when he went and we attended his graduation.  When he got married our invitation was made out to his mother plus one.  That was kind of a slap in the face but we still attended and gave them a substantial cash gift to start their life.  The thank you card didn't have my name on it.  \n\nMy first wife had passed away from.cancer and it broke me.  I didn't want to go through that again. Her youth was one thing that attracted me to my second wife. I know it was selfish.  But I liked having a beautiful young wife to take care of and she liked me well enough. I didn't realize how much I loved her until she died. She passed away from a stroke. She was 49.  \n\nCharlie came to the funeral with his family. His wife whom I had only met at the wedding and his kids. We had known he had kids but he had never made the effort to bring them for a visit.  My wife loved the kids but Charlie wouldn't make the effort to come see us.  \n\nMy wife only had a very small estate and she left it all to Charlie. He also took almost everything of sentimental value that she owned before we got married.  I didn't begrudge him any of it. \n\nMy first grandchild just graduated cum laude last year  and I went to his graduation. My son and his wife have worked hard to get their kids into college and I am proud of them. My son mentioned that my grandson had a job waiting and would be debt free pretty quick.  I asked how much he owed.  Then I wrote him a check to pay it off.  I plan to do this for all my grandchildren.   \n\nI guess my daughter-in-law and my stepson's wife are Facebook friends or something.  He found out what I did.  And he came around to ask if I planned to do the same for his children.  \n\nI don't really have any connections to his kids.  I don't see them. They don't consider me their grandfather. I've personally only ever seen them at the funeral.  I was really put off by him coming by to ask about money after ignoring me for years.  I know that if my wife were alive she would want me to help out her son. It just felt dirty. \n\nI said that I had money for them in my will and if they needed it for university I would give it to them early. \n\nHe said I'm a petty little man and that his mom would be ashamed of me for treating his kids like this.  \n\nI don't really think I owe them anything.  They have a \"real\" grandfather.

My kid\u2019s bio grandfather passed before I even met my partner. His mom/ my MIL has been in a long term relationship with her current partner for over a decade.

I see my step FIL more frequently then his daughter or granddaughters. He is a grandfather in all ways that matter to my kid. They\u2019re close. They love each other.\n\nWe expect nothing from his estate when the time comes (I hope in many many many many years) my MIL is the only one who contributes to my kids college account (she has more disposable income because he pays the bills so I\u2019m a way he does contribute) but we are the ones investing in that account and she gifts him cash deposits for birthdays and holidays since he has all the toys already. \n\nAnyway just to say that my kid and him have a wonderful relationship and me and my partner have a good relationship with him too. His daughter won\u2019t be looking for the inheritance to improve her life in any way either if that makes sense and we absolutely do not expect anything for our kid.

I also think that pulling them out of the will like people are suggesting would be a bit harsh.
