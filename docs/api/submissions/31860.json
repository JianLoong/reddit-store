That is completely fair.\n\nAlso, I hope that your Mom will be more reasonable this time, given that it is a **planned pregnancy** and also that **she won't be living with the kid**. My hunch is that your first pregnancy, at 17, triggered all of her old emotions about her own pregnancies given that \"she never wanted to be a mother.\" \n\nGood luck.", "NTA \n\nYou get to decide when you\u2019re ready to tell her, although she might react differently than you expect because there\u2019s a difference between your teenage daughter being pregnant and a grown adult with a fianc\u00e9 having a planned baby.", "NTA, can you block her for a couple of weeks, and have your fianc\u00e9 tell her? Would she probably pop up your place if you do and/or no contact her for a while? GL and congrats. Blessing to your entire family.", "NTA\n\nJust wait a while to tell your mother.  6 weeks is early, so wait until you are obviously showing, or at least 10-12 weeks.  \n\nOnce you tell her, **own it**.  Make sure she understands that this is a **planned pregnancy**  and that you and your partner look forward to welcoming the new little one into your lives.\n\nIf she is difficult and hateful about it, then go low contact with her for a while.  You don\u2019t need to be abused by her.", "NTA\n\nAt this point you need to limit your stress, and telling her will only bring you problems. \n\nAlthough, she will probably use the fact you didn't tell her to guilt trip you, and if she does that, just go very low contact with her. \n\nYou take care of yourself, and her reactions should not be anything you worry about.", "NTA. The most important thing right now is making sure you feel comfortable and safe. Your mom sounds toxic so stay away from her till the baby\u2019s here and you\u2019ve healed.", "NTA \n\nYou are no longer the 17 year old minor living in her house. Your pregnancy does not concern her.", "NAH. It's your news to tell who and when you want. But you mother's reaction to you being pregnant at *17* is a pretty normal reaction to have to that. Considering you're not a minor anymore, I would expect a different reaction this go.", "NTA\n\nIt's your right to say when you're pregnant, and if she can't handle it, then cut contact for a bit until mom gets a hold of herself", "Nah you can tell people when you want, but SURELY you see the difference.  Pregnant child at 17yp with 0 education, 0 way of supporting himself and baby vs. Pregnant adult with fianc\u00e9 and steady income.", "Nta, but of course, she was going to react terribly to her teenager being pregnant. Being 25, she probably would have a different one since you aren't dependent on her, but I could be wrong. Doesn't sound like she has a relationship with the first kid anyway, so I don't see why this is a question if that's the case.", "Info: so you live at your moms? But planned a pregnancy?

It is absurd to think she will not continue to do so. You have no obligation to expose yourself to the pregnancy risks that stress creates. Your duty is to your children. She already failed, you don't have to.", "NTA \n\nShe didn't react well for the first one which is understandable but throwing you out was not ok.", "Nta.

Maybe pop the news from the phone when you are both together, and away from the house for a couple of hours. That way you are able to support each other, while hopefully she cools down a bit.", "I think it's pretty normal to say that you're not going to take responsibility for a baby that isn't yours. She didn't just \"throw her to the street\"; she gave her a choice.", "i will say i didn\u2019t plan on getting pregnant at 17 and it is my fault but i also had a discussion with her about wanting to explore sexuality and asked her to put me on birth control and she didn\u2019t and despite having used a condom it failed and i ended up pregnant", ">she gave her a choice\n\nLike \"give me all your money or I'll kill you\" is a choice? I guess technically you are correct, but your lack of empathy is frightening."]}
