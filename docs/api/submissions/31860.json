That is completely fair.\n\nAlso, I hope that your Mom will be more reasonable this time, given that it is a **planned pregnancy** and also that **she won't be living with the kid**. My hunch is that your first pregnancy, at 17, triggered all of her old emotions about her own pregnancies given that \"she never wanted to be a mother.\" \n\nGood luck.", "NTA \n\nYou get to decide when you\u2019re ready to tell her, although she might react differently than you expect because there\u2019s a difference between your teenage daughter being pregnant and a grown adult with a fianc\u00e9 having a planned baby.", "NTA, can you block her for a couple of weeks, and have your fianc\u00e9 tell her? Would she probably pop up your place if you do and/or no contact her for a while? GL and congrats. Blessing to your entire family.", "NTA\n\nJust wait a while to tell your mother.  6 weeks is early, so wait until you are obviously showing, or at least 10-12 weeks.  \n\nOnce you tell her, **own it**.  Make sure she understands that this is a **planned pregnancy**  and that you and your partner look forward to welcoming the new little one into your lives.\n\nIf she is difficult and hateful about it, then go low contact with her for a while.  You don\u2019t need to be abused by her.", "NTA\n\nAt this point you need to limit your stress, and telling her will only bring you problems. \n\nAlthough, she will probably use the fact you didn't tell her to guilt trip you, and if she does that, just go very low contact with her. \n\nYou take care of yourself, and her reactions should not be anything you worry about.", "NTA. The most important thing right now is making sure you feel comfortable and safe. Your mom sounds toxic so stay away from her till the baby\u2019s here and you\u2019ve healed.", "NTA \n\nYou are no longer the 17 year old minor living in her house. Your pregnancy does not concern her.", "NAH. It's your news to tell who and when you want. But you mother's reaction to you being pregnant at *17* is a pretty normal reaction to have to that. Considering you're not a minor anymore, I would expect a different reaction this go.", "NTA\n\nIt's your right to say when you're pregnant, and if she can't handle it, then cut contact for a bit until mom gets a hold of herself", "Nah you can tell people when you want, but SURELY you see the difference.  Pregnant child at 17yp with 0 education, 0 way of supporting himself and baby vs. Pregnant adult with fianc\u00e9 and steady income.", "Nta, but of course, she was going to react terribly to her teenager being pregnant. Being 25, she probably would have a different one since you aren't dependent on her, but I could be wrong. Doesn't sound like she has a relationship with the first kid anyway, so I don't see why this is a question if that's the case.", "Info: so you live at your moms? But planned a pregnancy? When knowing how she will react, why not move out first? \ud83e\udd14\n\nEdit: NTA. It\u2019s your body, your baby, your news.

It is absurd to think she will not continue to do so. You have no obligation to expose yourself to the pregnancy risks that stress creates. Your duty is to your children. She already failed, you don't have to.", "NTA \n\nShe didn't react well for the first one which is understandable but throwing you out was not ok.", "Nta. My rule of thumb is to not announce to anyone until the second trimester anyways, so I don't blame you for not wanting her to know.", "NTA - tell her when you are ready to tell her.", "i was planning on telling her i was pregnant on thanksgiving but we got into an argument about my brother who is in jail and she told me she\u2019s more proud of me than him because \u201ci learn from my mistakes\u201d and haven\u2019t had anymore kids which i don\u2019t and never have seen my son as a mistake and i told her before i got pregnant the first time i was wanting to explore in that area and told her i wanted to be put on birth control and she didn\u2019t care i was honest and despite having used a condom i got pregnant anyways i made me not want to tell her despite it having been planned this time", "thank you and my mom would absolutely turn up at my place and scream and cause a whole scene and i don\u2019t want to put the stress on him to deal with my mother bc he has seizures that are stress induced", "Throwing your pregnant 17yo to the street is not normal. Don't make it out as if it's ok. It's ok to not be happy about it, but a 17yo is still your responsability.", "Ugh, I'm epileptic so I get the dangers of stress for the both of you. Maybe pop the news from the phone when you are both together, and away from the house for a couple of hours. That way you are able to support each other, while hopefully she cools down a bit.", "I think it's pretty normal to say that you're not going to take responsibility for a baby that isn't yours. She didn't just \"throw her to the street\"; she gave her a choice.", "i will say i didn\u2019t plan on getting pregnant at 17 and it is my fault but i also had a discussion with her about wanting to explore sexuality and asked her to put me on birth control and she didn\u2019t and despite having used a condom it failed and i ended up pregnant", ">she gave her a choice\n\nLike \"give me all your money or I'll kill you\" is a choice? I guess technically you are correct, but your lack of empathy is frightening.", "Nah. You have every right not to say anything. \n\nBut you have to realize there is a huge difference in circumstances between the two pregnancies.", "Most people don\u2019t announce pregnancies until the end of the first trimester due to the higher likelihood of miscarriage during those early weeks. So no, NTA for not telling her right now.\n\nBut you\u2019ll probably have to tell her eventually because you aren\u2019t going to be able to hide it forever.", "6 weeks is very early to talk about it anyhow. And while the context of this pregnancy is very different than your first, I fully understand why you would not feel confident of her support and love if you did choose to tell her. \n\nMaybe make a plan together with your husband. If you choose to tell her after the traditional 12 week mark, and she reacts badly, perhaps it's best to do so in a public setting with an escape plan ready to go. You never have to sit around and listen to someone scream about you. If she chooses to talk badly about you to family members, and it gets back to you, you can always reply that you're very sorry she feels that way, and leave it at that. \n\nIt sounds like your mother has unfinished work to do on her emotional and mental maturity and unfortunately, you're getting the brunt of it. But you're an adult now, and you don't need to stick around. Set your boundaries and if they are transgressed, remove yourself from the situation. You can't control other people, but you do have control over your reaction to them", "NTA. Actually, why tell your mom at all? At least until you're showing so much it is obvious or a family member spills the beans.\n\nIt is *your* pregnancy and *your* life, you should enjoy it as much as possible! Being pregnant is a very special time. You, your son, and your fiance should be enjoying a happy and peaceful time right now.\n\nEdit: Oops! I forgot the NTA part ;-)", "6 weeks is really early to be telling anyone, there's a 50/50 chance that thing can slip out. NTA because of past trauma. I would be hesitant, too.\n\nI got an abortion at age 20 when I was 17 weeks along and do everything I can to avoid being pregnant. My mom was the main reason I aborted. And I'll never trust her again with knowing about my life.", "YTA - for holding the grudge. You got pregnant and I am guessing still in high school. She probably wanted you to have a life. She also didn\u2019t want to raise another kid. I am also guessing you have bothered to talked to her either about this.\nNTA - your baby and your news. Just remember this time you are an adult not a kid still in higher school. \n\nCongratulations", "NTA. She's lucky you allow her in your life. When you do tell her, give her clear rules about what she says and does and tells people and her following those rules will determine how much you let her into your life. Personally, I would have cut her from my life by now.", "NTA your mother sounds toxic.\n\nYou don't have to tell her.", "If sharing the news will be detrimental to your wellbeing then don't. Tell her when you are ready. But be prepared she may find out for other means. \n\nCongratulations. NTA", "NTA. She doesn't deserve to know.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy.", "INFO: is there a reason you think she\u2019ll react badly to this pregnancy? \n\nSurely you can expect a different reaction to a planned pregnancy at 25 than a teenage pregnancy while still living under her roof.\n\nYou\u2019re always going to be NTA, because it\u2019s your choice when to announce your pregnancy. But I\u2019ve gotta assume your mom\u2019s reaction will be different this time around, so possibly NAH.", "NAH, obviously getting knocked up at 17 outside of a relationship is not the same as planning to have a kid at 25 with a fianc\u00e9. But she behaved really poorly last time and you are not over it.", "NTA\n\nShe didn\u2019t want kids and let it be known. Granted.", "No it isn't. \n\nNormal parents aupport their children.", "she does have a relationship with my son she loves him i don\u2019t take him over there very often because she\u2019s sweet and nice for about 15 minutes then she\u2019s trying to rush us back out the door and when i was 17 i told her i wanted to be put on birth control because i was wanting to explore sexuality she didn\u2019t and despite having used a condom i got pregnant", "Agreed. You can tell who ever you want but to hold a grudge on her reaction when you were a TEEN is ridiculous.", "i have actually talked to her many times about how i feel she usually brushes off my feelings and says i should have learned from her experience as a teen mom as she had my older brother when she was 16 and i did learn which is why i was open and honest with her when i was starting to want to explore sexuality i was only a few weeks away from my 18th birthday when i found out i was pregnant however it is still my fault i got pregnant im not blaming her for that but i do blame her for how she treated me when i told her and i was homeschooled but then i didn\u2019t have a home to be schooled in so i got my GED and bc of my GED scores i got a scholarship but chose to go straight to working. I do feel really salty about a lot of things she\u2019s done my first pregnancy is not the only thing im holding a grudge for. i\u2019ve been to therapy for it and have tried talking to her about everything but she just brushes everything off like it doesn\u2019t matter because im an adult now and i \u201cturned out ok\u201d", "\"i don\u2019t live with her anymore\"\n\nShe doesn't live at her mom's anymore, but is still worried about the reaction.", "i don\u2019t live with her but it was a planned pregnancy", "the problem is i know her well enough to know she never wanted kids and never wanted grandkids she wanted my son to call her by her first name and to this day 6 years later she still give the most evil glare to anyone who insinuates she is a grandma", "I mean, telling someone you are expecting at 6 weeks is not exactly it either, babe. Look, there is clearly a lot going on here, but at 6 weeks you're 2 weeks after missing a period - there's a reason why you are told not to spread things around until 12+ weeks. I get that you're excited for a do-over and to try to get your mom excited about your kid this time, but slow your roll.", "That still isn't her fault. You are the one that decided to have sex with only one form of birth control. You played the odds and lost. It's like you told her that you wanted to go bungie jumping but she didn't give you a rope or harness so it's her fault when the twine broke causing your injuries.", "With a mom like that, consider moving and not giving your mom your address before the baby is born, if possible. But don\u2019t answer the door if she comes over. It can be uncomfortable but once you do it in general people like her don\u2019t show up again if no one answers.", "Thx. Must have overread that. \ud83d\udc4d", "Not to be grim, but I had a miscarriage at 6 wks, not more than two days after my husband and I told my mom and sister I was pregnant for the second time. I agree that OP should wait a little while, especially if her mom is going to make drama about it.", "Yeah, 6 weeks is early! I\u2019m quite close with my mum, and she\u2019s been looking forward to being a grandma for decades, but I still waited until 12 weeks to tell her.", "\"Give up your child or I'll make you homeless\" isn't refusing to take responsibility for someone else's child. It is denying someone- in this case, a MINOR- an essential need for their survival.", "> That still isn't her fault. \n\nIt kind of is though? OP didn't make the smartest decision, but OP was also a teenager and teenagers do dumb things. That's why they're still dependent on their parents.", "When your child is a minor you\u2019re responsible. That includes if your 17 year old gets in a reckless bungee jumping accident. There are plenty of parents caring for teenagers after stupid preventable car accidents for example. You don\u2019t get to say nah, you\u2019re on your own.", "Yeah, as a mother I can say that's a failure of parenting. It's our responsibility to ensure that our children have access to their preferred method of birth control.", "Sure if this was something necessary and completely unavoidable like getting vaccinated as a child or being taught stranger danger. But this was a 17 yearold having sex with only condoms. It is solely on OP. They clearly knew that getting on bc would help but still chose to have sex without it. She didn't have to have sex but decided she wanted to experiment and can't place the blame on her mother for the outcome. There are plenty of 17 yearold girls who are not given bc from their parents and do not end up pregnant."]}
