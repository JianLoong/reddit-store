I went to a college mostly full of rich kids whose tuition was being paid by their parents or grandparents and who had tons of extra cash. I had to pay my own tuition. I lost friends because I couldn't afford to go out for their birthdays or because I couldn't hang out as I was working when I wasn't in class. That sucked, but I never blamed them for not paying for me or for the fact that they were rich and I wasn't. It was just life.

And the world owes none of us anything. It'd be nice if it did, but that's not how our society has been built, and it won't change overnight.\n\nYour school has chosen to make things a bit more equal for students whose families would never be able to afford full price tuition. No full ride scholarship at any school provides 100% of living expenses. There's always something you have to pay, whether that's parking or entertainment funds or food and lodging and books. The very few students in the US paid to go to college are statistical anomalies.\n\nThis puts no obligation on the students who aren't getting a need based scholarship to change their lifestyle or pay for other students to participate in that lifestyle. Expecting that is the definition of entitlement, and it's not going to get your friend anywhere. Who wants to be friends with someone who's entire personality is to put down people more affluent than themselves? That's a lot of negativity to charge a relationship with.\n\nBut I'm going to guess that the FGLI students stick together because they can't participate in any real sense with the rest of the student body outside of a classroom. They can't afford the same restaurants, they can't do spring break in the Caribbean, they can't even wear the same clothes. By every metric, they have different life experiences and little in common with the rest of the student body. And they talk about socioeconomic issues amongst themselves because their exclusion hurts, even if the rest of you don't mean to hurt their feelings and they're processing that as a group. You clearly don't empathize with them or understand why they resent you.\n\nBut I think your friendship with someone who is guilt tripping you for not inviting them on a vacation organized by someone they don't know is at an end.", "NTA.

They all stay in an echo chamber and create a narrative of \"us vs them\" that actually is in the way of them making important connections.

Are the folks who are used to fancy dinners and vacations happy to try something cheaper? I definitely think this approach can vary depending on the people....some people are NEVER going to temporarily accept something \"lesser\" (aka less expensive or less luxorious) just to spend time with friends who can't afford the expensive stuff. Ofc some people are also fine with it and it's fun for all involved!

Your complaints about her attitude are valid, but your opinion of whether or not sub-$75k is poor and whether or not someone should get a scholarship isn't really relevant. How much money do you make a year?"]}
