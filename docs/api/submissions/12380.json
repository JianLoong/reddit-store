If so good for you, if not, understand she likely has never had that privilege. But also you should try to understand that lower income families, generally do not have free time like children of privileged families have to study. Lower income families generally have to pick up the slack on chores, making extra income i.e second jobs, taking care of siblings that might have been in daycare or had a nanny to watch them.

That\u2019s why low-income immigrant families thrive, for instance.\n\nFamilies are supposed to provide for their children. Mine has succeeded, so we don\u2019t get aid.
