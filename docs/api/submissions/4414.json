I've tried having her over with the others twice- the first time she got bent out of shape over my boyfriend watching an action movie in the living room and that was \"too intense for her to hear\" and the second time she flipped out over my Jason bust to the point she cried and had to leave.\n\nIf she's not doing stuff like that then she's the sort that has to bring up god and Jesus whenever someone talks about something going on in their life.

I've talked to Nina about all of this before and said she'd talk to her. \n\nWelp. Nina is getting married and she asked all 4 of us to be her bridesmaids. I figured I could put up with Laura for one day and small windows of time doing bridesmaid stuff for Nina's sake. It was going well until Nina suggested we go away for a bachelorette weekend. She wanted us to arrive at our destination Thursday afternoon, and spend Friday, Saturday, and most of Sunday there. Nothing fancy just going to one of the metro areas to hang out. We meet up Thursday afternoon at the hotel and I'm wearing a hoodie my boyfriend bought me for my bday. Laura goes right into how the picture on it is evil and I should be wary about wearing 'evil' imagery. I ignore it. For dinner, we go to get hibachi and some of us ordered sushi rolls to go with dinner. We offered Laura some and it was a 5 minute rant about how sushi isn't for her. She had something negative to say about just about every part of the meal. At that point I knew I couldn\u2019t last a weekend without snapping so I waited until an hour or so after dinner and said I felt really sick and was just going to go home. I thought that would be better than making a scene over Laura. \n\nYesterday my boyfriend and I spent the day out. The other bridesmaid posted up some pics of their day and tagged me in it saying they wished I was there and to feel better.

You were trying to have class and grace and not make a scene and not make someone feel bad. However, I would consider talking to Nina again about this. It seems Laura is doing more than just being annoying, she's directly criticizing you (the hoodie) and she's also being toxic for the group by ruining the events (complaining throughout the meal). I wouldn't want to put up with her for five minutes, let alone a whole day and then some.\n\nETA: the only part where you went wrong was lying and then being caught. You shouldn't have lied, because now you friend the bride may have a different opinion of you. But I can see how you were trying your best.", "NTA except it might have been better to bring up the issue to your friend beforehand and see what she wanted you to do.\n\nBy the way, in your own house you can make your own rules. No religion talk isn't an unreasonable rule. Put it on a cutesy sign if you're worried about stating it.", "NTA  \n\nToo bad social media keeps everyone's lives intertwined into everyone else's.    You can't go out without being seen and tagged and your white lie outed.     \n\nYou were trying to make your friend's weekend nicer by not telling her rude friend to shut the hell up about herself and her opinions.   \n\nYou did the right thing.  \n\nDoes Nina see how her friend is so rude?", "Ever hear the phrase \u201cDon\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm?\n\nNTA. You don\u2019t have to be mistreated.\n\nAlso THEY told Nina not you. They knew damn well you were just excusing yourself politely and that\u2019s why they were picking on you for not being sick. Nina prob knew that and didn\u2019t want to make a big stink out of it either.", "Yeah, you can't like everyone. This Laura sounds like a piece of shiz but you  walked put on a friend who wanted you around. Talk to the bride.", "NTA for leaving. It\u2019s a mature move to leave any situation that could cause you to have a negative reaction instead of staying and potentially causing a scene. However, it is a bit immature to lie about being sick. You are an adult who gets to make her own decisions about what she does and does not want to do. Next time just tell the host \u2018I\u2019m feeling a bit emotionally exhausted so I\u2019m gonna take off\u2019. A good friend will understand and respect your choice.", "NTA \n\nWhen I know someone will make me snap (and that can get pretty nasty and ugly because I have a temper) I find it better that I remove myself from said situation to avoid a horrible escalation and a possible falling out with friends or family.", "NTA \nBut you shouldn\u2019t have been out all day. It\u2019s a big big thing to miss a bachelorette and your choices were stick it out or go home \u201csick\u201d and stay there on pain of death. Of course Nina is going to be upset - she likes that idiot friend and she doesn\u2019t understand why she\u2019s nails-on-a-chalkboard to you. In her mind you should have been the bigger person and avoided engaging and just ignored her, because this was a weekend about Nina. She\u2019s gonna think you hate this girl more than you love her. \n\nYou\u2019re in trouble, OP, and you\u2019re gonna have to get Nina alone and apologize. You thought you could stick it out but the woman drives you nuts, and you didn\u2019t want to make waves. You love her and you\u2019re very sorry to have let her down. She might not forgive right away, but if you really value her you\u2019re going to have to try to understand the hurt and probably embarrassment she experienced. I\u2019m sorry though, I would also kind of want to off that girl - she sounds like the worst!", "NTA - Since Laura grates your nerves so much, and not everyone else, it's best that you took yourself out of the equation because the tension would have actually ruined the weekend.  \n\nYou can be 100% right, but that wasn't the time to teach an unteachable person that their holier-than-thou personality sucks.  What triggers you may not trigger other people. \n\nThat said, you should have sent Nina a DM when you got home and explained yourself.  Not doing so was immature.", "NTA. I would have done the same.", "info: is Nina upset about this?", "You should have told Nina before you left. \n\nNow she's heard through someone else and you look bad. \n\nLaura sounds dreadful. What a bore.", "There weren't a lot of great choices open to you when she was getting on your nerves that badly. I believe that you tried and I believe you know yourself well enough that leaving was a better option than causing drama. Ironically, your worst choice might've been to ever fess up you weren't sick! That's just my take. Offer apologies and smooth things over so you can stand by your friend when she gets married. And then avoid Laura all together. She sounds awful, by the way. NTA", "NTA. You removed yourself from the situation without specifically calling anyone out. Sounds like Laura needs to get her shit together and your other friends need to do something about her.", "ESH - While annoying, you were there for Nina; you could have ignored it or at least vented/checked with any of the others if they felt the same.  The person that called you out for being at the store is just a sh\\*tty person.  And finally, the other girls telling Nina why you left weren't thinking about the bride anymore than you were when they dropped a truth bomb on her. (Willing to bet they felt the same as you did, but sucked it up and used your actions as their excuse to pile on).\n\nI say you owe Nina a live talk.  Apologize, tell her you honestly made the decision you did thinking it was the best 'drama-free' way to go as you didn't want the exact type of blow up that happened when the girls felt the need to share w/Laura your truth.  Tell her you care, you want this to go smoothly and wonderfully for her. Then ask her how you can make it up to her, and let her know if she wants to make any changes, you'll go along with whatever her choice is.", "NTA", "Nope NTA you gave already tried expressing how you felt about her and you were ignored. So you did what was best for your own sanity. You shouldn't have to suck it for the sake of Nina..", "You were trying to be courteous but you could've sucked it up for your friend. No judgement from me.", "ESH\n\nDipping and lying about it doesn\u2019t sound cool. Just be upfront with Nina about her attitude in a private manner and if it doesn\u2019t change let her friend handle it.", "ESH, because you committed to yourself, you would suck it up for Nina's sake. She deserved the truth why you wanted to leave. And Laura sucks as well, she is the biggest AH in this story.", "Soft YTA. You should have told Nina, \u201clook, I can\u2019t cope with this, I\u2019m going home,\u201d and then done so, not continued to have a Baja blast in the metro area, just avoiding your bff and her entourage. I get why you did it, and Laura sounds like a piece of work, but Nina has every right to be upset with you. \n\nI\u2019m terribly curious what the evil imagery on your hoodie was, though. My imagination is running wild.", "NTA but I will say, that doesn't seem like a lot to reach a possible boiling point.", "YTA. You ditched your friend on her *bachelorette* weekend. Imagine if it was your bachelorette party, a friend told you she was sick, and then you find out later she's actually super fine, she just lied to you and didn't want to be there. You'd be hurt for sure.", "YTA.\n\nYou ditched, lied about it, and then did such a poor job following through with the lie that you caused a bunch of drama anyways. Way more drama than what a simple private convo with Nina would have caused. \n\nIf you can\u2019t handle being around this person that\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to suck it up if you don\u2019t want to. But I would expect my friend to at least be truthful with me.", "I would of gone NTA if you told Nina the truth, but you didn\u2019t and just ditched her thing.  If you can\u2019t take someone, be an adult and tell people the truth.  So mild YTA because you made a BS excuse.", "YTA\n\nSo is Laura, but I can't vote E S H, because Nina is fine.\n\nYes, you should have sucked it up. You are a bad friend for leaving your friend in the middle of her bachelorette party over a personality clash with one of her other invited guests.", "YTA for committing even though you knew you couldn't stand Laura.", "YTA for lacking the backbone to simply not lie. I know you were trying to keep the focus off of you. You wanted to preserve Nina's happiness. That is admirable. You can tell the truth without creating a scene:\n\n \"I'm sorry to leave early, but I'm having some personal issues. I don't want to get into it now. I'm healthy and safe but I do have to cut my participation short. You guys have a fabulous time! I'll see you at the wedding.\"\n\nThat's not a lie. It's also not singling anyone out. When asked privately, tell Laura the truth. She needs to hear it. But lying is just enabling her to continue with her nonsense. Lies also sets you up for exactly the kind of problem you ended up having.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Given that someone called you out for not seeming sick, it sounds like the whole group of them talk out of the side of their mouth.\n\nIt sounds like the larger issue here is that the bride knows her group is catty and is allowing them to be catty with you rather than trying to check them, either because she likes the dynamic or just because she doesn't want to fight them.

Once you told the lie, telling the truth was WAS going to hurt your friend.\nSo not only does everyone know you don't have enough self control to get through a weekend, but you are the kind of person who had to dump on a bridesmaid to another bridesmaid right before the wedding.

I applaud you for removing yourself from a situation that was bad for your mental health and could potentially be a cause for a nasty weekend if you stayed. \n\nHowever, the most effective way to avoid the drama would be to have spoken to the bride and made arrangements for you two another day. (If there wasn\u2019t an obvious solution for the weekend event.) That\u2019s why people are calling you an asshole. However, protecting people from your own potential toxic behaviors isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing.

OP should ask herself this:\n\nIf you behaved the same way toward anyone in the group the way Laura behaves toward you, what would happen?\n\nSomething tells me it wouldn\u2019t be taken lying down the way they expect OP to take it. \n\nI have no patience for people who are allowed to behave rudely because \u201cyou know how they are.\u201d If it would be rude for anyone else to do, it\u2019s just rude.", "I agree, and suffer from the same problem.  Many is the time I have had to walk away before committing mayhem.  And may whatever God you worship help you if you chase after me.  You'll get both barrels - loaded with armor-piercing rounds.", "I have talked to and mentioned it to Nina a few times while we were hanging out or getting lunch. I've only tried talking to Laura herself twice when she went on her 'evil' tirades about a stupid character bust in my house. I was calm and apologetic for it bothering her but she wasn't listening, so I tried again another time away from my house and she got worked up and didn't want to think about it.", "I've had a number of discussions with Nina about Laura in the past. Nina has also picked up on me quieting down and my mood shifting after too many Laura comments in one evening. Nina is also aware that when I've tried to talk to Laura myself about it, Laura got worked up and didn't want to hear part of it.", "It is when our tattoos are 'evil', or the 'Ghoul Squad' picture frames I made some of us for Halloween is 'evil' or knowing that we've got Buddhists, Pagans, and Taoists in our friend group and plugging her religion into every aspect of other people's lives. Like once in awhile is tolerable, everytime I see her not so much.", "It's a statue of Jason Vorhees from mid-chest and up.", "Then why Nina angry with you? She knows the background, has she tell Laura to stop bothering you? She can't be angry if she do nothing.", "Snitch? How could that person possibly have known the situation?", "\u2018Wish sick op was here\u2019\n\n\u2018She didn\u2019t look sick when I saw her out\u2019 as a post comment, not dm, making it much worse\n\nSnitching, busybody, shit stirring, whatever you wanna call it. \n\nOp could have addressed it at a better time and place. Snitch soured the rest of the trip.", "NTA you didn\u2019t ruin anything, they are choosing to feel that way about it.", "op=NTA\n\nyou gracefully got out of a situation where you were tired of being bullied and abused.  Evil hoodie-what garbage.\n\nHowever, your friends are sh\\*t-stirrers.  You may want to rethink a few of them.\n\nPS next time compound first fib with a second.  Say you made a miraculous recovery after you removed the evil hoodie.", "I'd kinda suggest asking yourself how much you like these people.\n\nLaura is obviously tiresome as hell, but these other bridesmaids went straight to Nina to tell her this. They could have just kept quiet and noone would be upset. So we're at like...3 of the 4 seem like a waste of time. Just Nina left. Based on Nina apparently being all good with the way Laura acts and how she speaks to you, is she really your friend?", "help, I'm scrolling to find out what a \"Jason bust\" is.", "Dm could\u2019ve waited til trip was finished and not sour the rest of the weekend. Like you don\u2019t give someone bad news on vacation if they can\u2019t do anything about it then. You only ruin it for them and they are hurt twice.", "NTA. Sounds like Nina was aware of the potential issue, would\u2019ve been a good idea for her to have a talk with you both before the bachelorette weekend.", "Honestly sounds like Nina isn\u2019t as good of a friend to you as she is Laura if she\u2019s never on your side. Something to think about.", "keep us updated on it!", ">She should bring Evil Hoodie to wedding in case she gets cold and needs to slip it on over bridesmaid dress at the reception.", "That's what I thought too! Like who the fuck blows up someone's spot like that? Mine your business person!", "Ah of course lol I totally blanked :) cool tho", "Info: what is your Jason bust and why did it cause Laura to leave in tears?", "NTA but sorry were in a no win situation", "INFO: What is a Jason bust?", "So next time I had to interact with Laura, I\u2019d make sure to wear a hoodie with 1. Baphomet or 2. Large pentagram. Problem solved. A family friend kept bombing my inbox with bible quotes and Jesus pics. I sent her a pic of Baphomet as a reply. I\u2019m also a petty brat with a truly horrible sense of humor.", "The real AH\u2019s here are the individual who outted you and the ones who told Nina about it. I think she\u2019s going to be justified in feeling hurt, and you\u2019ll need to make amends to her why you did what you did. I mean, it was all meant to be in celebration of her in the end. Having said that, I probably would have done the same as you did. I have someone like Laura in my family, and she\u2019s the reason no one ever spends time with my brother. A real shame, but some people are just intolerable.", "OP, I can't remember who said or where I read it but there's  famous quote by someone who, to paraphrase, said that you can judge a person by the friends they keep.\n\nI know you're been friends with Nina for a long time but from the way you've described her, Laura seems to have few, if any, redeeming qualities. What is it about her that Nina (and the others) likes?\n\nI'm an old git now but I have met several people throughout my life who I felt, at the time, were really good, solid, reliable, decent people. Until I met their partners.\n\nI am immensely suspicious of 'decent' people who have sh\\*t partners/friends as it makes me doubt my initial assessment of them.\n\nMight be time to reflect on/review/revise your relationship with members of your friend group, even if you continue to be friendly with them.\n\nNTA but why did your dipsh\\*t friend tell Nina what you told her? See what I mean about 'decent' people?", "NTA  Yes! All good points.", ">you could have ignored it or at least vented/checked with any of the others if they felt the same.\n\nI disagree, had OP done this, then it would've turned into a bunch of drama and likely one of them would've told Laura or Nina and OP would be in the same, or worse, position that she is now. She did the right thing to remove herself from the event before she acted badly or ruined it for the rest of the group."]}
