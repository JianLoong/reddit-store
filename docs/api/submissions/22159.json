She's proud of this bullshit, and it is the basis of their relationship. Unreal.", "If anything, OP should just let her keep telling people. All it means is that more and more people will realize that his wife is a psycho. And maybe after hearing his wife tell everyone over and over again, eventually he\u2019ll hopefully realize it too.", "I\u2019d probably be looking at the husband like: do you need help? Blink once if yes.", "It makes me genuinely concerned for OP.", "I am horrified about this story, this isn't an \"awe, what an adorable yet embarrssing story\" this is a \"Did hades and persephone switch genders?\" Holy Stockholm syndrome batman", "Wife is still a bully and a boastful bully at that", "It wasn\u2019t even so she could date him, it was merely so OP wouldn\u2019t try to date anyone else, so she could decide wether she wanted to date OP", "Sounds like Narcissism. She has him in the devalue stage so he feels he can not do any better and forces him to be codependent he needs to dump her regain his power", "Yeah the wife doesn\u2019t come off as well in that story as she seems to think!", "Yeah.  Shout out to OP and anyone else in an abusive relationship...its not your fault.", "This. Years of abuse reprograms you. OP, get into therapy if you can.", "Wait, but is it real?", "No, you see by marrying her and going along with her plan he was standing up to her so that he could\u2026\u2026..ok yea I don\u2019t get it either.", "enemies to lovers speedrun", "Yeah it's always sad to when a plan like this worked and it makes it worse when you read OP believes that he stood up for himself enough for it to not break his self-esteem.", "I\u2019m desperately trying to find any kind of explanation other than \u201cshe\u2019s bragging about bullying him into submission\u201d because that\u2019s almost too awful to comprehend. \n\nI was hoping it was like \u201cshe is bragging that she changed herself so drastically from her bullying ways that OP finally saw the good in her and now she\u2019s proud of herself and her relationship and doesn\u2019t want to deny how it started\u201d but I know that\u2019s a fool\u2019s hope", "Agreed, if the genders were reversed people would say the husband used the same tactics that a pimp would use in order to \"break\" or \"groom\" his girlfriend into submitting and becoming his wife. This is disturbing and the wife is definitely TA and the former and current abuser. OP if you read this please consider therapy.", "Hey,  he stood up to her SEVERAL times. (This joke may be in poor taste as it is obviously op trying to save face)\n\nShe thinks she was successful, has no issues continuing to trample him...\n\nBro, you deserve someone who delights in your victories and shares your happiness, not wishes it all for themselves.", "Coming soon to an ASMR channel near you.", "She did succeed because he married her instead of running as far away as he could.", "> Hey, he stood up to her SEVERAL times.\n\nYeah, it's incredibly poor taste.\n\nIt's not funny when any abuse victim tries to salvage some semblance of self-worth internally while dealing with the trauma that abuse inflicts on them."]}
