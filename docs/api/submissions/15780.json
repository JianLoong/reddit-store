He had two kids from a previous marriage \u201cSam\u201d (M14) and \u201cZach\u201d (M9). My husband and I started dating when Zach was 4 and Sam was 9. I treat both of them like they are my own sons but Zach and I have a closer relationship. I figure it is because I met him when he was very young. My husband and his ex wife have 50-50 custody, 1 week with us and then 1 week with her.\n\nNow for the situation. In our home, we have a rule where there are no electronics after 8:30PM. This applies to my husband and I as well. We think it\u2019s important for us to have a quality family time for a bit in the evenings and to protect our young kids from using the internet without our supervision (the internet is a dangerous place for kids nowadays). \n\nSam is very involved in school with extracurriculars and sports so sometimes he doesn\u2019t get home until 7PM. Sometimes it can be hard for him to balance everything but he doesn\u2019t want to give up anything and we support him. 2 nights ago he came home at 7 and we ate dinner, watched a 30 minutes show, and then Sam went up to his room around 8. I planned to read before bed so I put my phone and laptop in the \u201cDocking Station\u201d early. This is where we put our electronics at 8:30. At 8:45/9PM I checked on Sam and he was on his computer. I asked him why he was breaking the rules and he said he had homework due the next day that he had to finish. I told him that unfortunately rules are rules and he will have to put his laptop up immediately and I will spare him the consequence. He told me that it would only take him 15 more minutes, I said no he has to give it to me now. After some back and forth he gave it to me. Our consequence is that if you beak this rule you cannot have any electronics for 3 days. Because he argued with me I told him he cannot have his laptop, phone, or Nintendo Switch for 3 days. He was extremely upset, calling me names, saying how I wasn\u2019t his mother but I took his electronics and left. \n\nYesterday I got a phone call from my husband\u2019s ex-wife. She started yelling at me over the phone telling me that Sam got a 0 on an assignment because I didn\u2019t let him finish it and that this rule in our home is absurd. Turns out he emailed her from a school laptop. She was furious and I told her  that respectfully that at our home we have our own rules and when the kids are here they have to follow them. Also that Sam should have planned better to get the work done before 8:30. She yelled at me some more and said that this was not fair at all and that I was being a \u201ctyrant\u201d. After this I called my husband and he told me to stick to my rule but to not talk to his ex anymore because he doesn\u2019t want her to yell at him. Now Sam is giving me the silent-angry treatment and his mother has been texting me that I am cold and heartless.

If he gets home at 7, how will he have time to eat and do homework by 8:30? Like it or not, electronics are essential for school nowadays, and he should get his homework done one way or another.", "YTA. This rule is not appropriate for a 14 year old especially given his schedule. He doesn\u2019t get home until 7 pm and he needs some time to eat, relax and then do homework. \n\nYou need to adjust the time so he has time to finish his homework, and there should be an exception to this electronics rule to allow him to get his work done. I honestly cannot believe you stopped him from finishing an assignment he was working on! \n\n3 days is also a really over the top punishment. So much of the work and comms are on electronics for students that you\u2019re basically locking him in a dark room for 3 days. \n\nI say this as someone who had to closely monitor my son in school for overuse of electronics. We had many rules in place but we did need to be flexible and recognize when his needs changed. \n\nI am glad he emailed his Mom because he did need her to intervene. Rethink this approach because it\u2019s  going to set you up for many more conflicts to come.", "YTA. No rules should EVER prevent a kid to do their homework. This is bad, bad, bad parenting.", "**YTA** \\- Inflexibility is not a desirable life skill.", "YTA. Kid had to do homework and failed because you don\u2019t know how to compromise. Family time wasn\u2019t going to happen anyway, you were going to read. The internet has never been safe for kids, instead of sheltering them from that try having conversations about it. \n\nSurely you remember what being a teen is like, and how hard it is to juggle extracurricular activities, social life, and homework. Sounds like the kid is doing his best and you\u2019re making it difficult for him.", "YTA. Homework has got to be an exception to this rule. If he\u2019d spent all afternoon and evening faffing around playing games then this might be a way of teaching him consequences, but he has extracurricular activities that you accepted and having a 1 hour break when he gets home to eat and decompress is not unreasonable. You are compromising his education, and also punishing him when he\u2019s trying to be responsible which is a warped thing to teach anybody.", "YTA. A limitation on using electronics for leisure is completely understandable, but schoolwork? Seriously? And you said yourself that his extracurriculars don't end until 7 pm, so he doesn't have that much time until 8:30 and with the amount of homework these days it's almost impossible to finish. So yes, you are effectively setting him up for failure by either making him miss his homework assignment or give up his extracurriculars to fit into your ridiculous schedule. That's being a definition of mean stepmother, small wonder his mother blew up at you.", "YTA. You punished him for trying to do his homework, and because you prevented him from finishing it, you caused him to fail an assignment. \n\nI don't understand how you can possibly think you're not the asshole. This rule is ridiculous, and I wouldn't blame his mother if she tried to take custody away from your husband over this rule.", "YTA\n\nYou forbid your step son from doing homework.  Obviously that\u2019s not ok.  All of my kid\u2019s homework has had to be done on an iPad (provided by the school) since 6th grade.  I assume this is pretty typical nowadays.  Make a homework exception.", "YTA. He was doing fucking homework.  Pull your head out of your ass.", "YTA\n\nIt's like you were born in the 1950s. Computers are mandatory for education now. If you continue to enforce this rule you will be negatively affecting your step son's education, and I guarantee he's gonna hold that one against you when he can't get the college/career that he wants.", "Sam gets home at 7, eats dinner, 30 minutes of watching show as a family. When is he supposed to do his homework?\n\nHow is he supposed to do it without a computer for 3 days?\n\nYou say you support him in his activites. Do you ask how much homework he has a night and help him manage his time? \nYou knew there was homework and instead of saying, finish it and I\u2019ll stay here to make sure you are doing homework or how can you help him get it done? Waking up early the next morning? No, you had to win and take it away.\n\nI would also look at the consequence versus the wrong doing\u20263 days is severe. And also how you handle when they need the item. How does homework get done? Will he be getting more zeros? \n\nDo you have a landline that he can talk to his mom? If not, how can he communicate when you take away the phone with her?\n\nYTA", "YTA, he should be able to do his freakin homework!  This could affect his future schooling.  you are both DH!", "YTA He wasn't playing games or playing around, he was doing his school work. The ex-wife had every right to lash out at you.", "YTA schoolwork has to get done and he is 14, 830 is a ridiculous time to expect him to be finished with his work", "YTA -- soon he and his mom will tell him he should live with her full time, and a judge will listen to your insane rules, and he will be gone and your husband will pay child support.", "Tyrant is a pretty valid description of you. You'd seriously rather have your kid fail assignments than give him a little extra time to complete his *schoolwork*!? What is wrong with you? YTA.", "Wow you\u2019re not a stepmom you are a tyrant the REAL mom called that right. Look yes the kid mismanaged his time by watching a show but to force the kid to not finish his homework? Impact his grades? For what, so he respects your authority? You don\u2019t have a good relationship with him bc you are not a good parent. You punish him twice once by not letting him do his homework and then again for breaking your 8:30 rule. Yes this could have been a teachable moment but you turned it into a reason why he should hate you and his father.", "YTA. In order for any rule to be effective is for it to be flexible enough to accommodate different situation. Your rule is not.  According to you, your rules exists to \"have a quality family time for a bit in the evenings and to protect our young kids from using the internet without our supervision\"\n\n1. Clearly you did not have a quality family time\n2. you could have stayed in his room and supervised him for 15 minutes while he is finished HM (I think it would be completely overboard but at least you would allow him to finish his HM)\n\nDogma in any form is bad\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA Let him do his homework which much more important than your stupid rules. You said yourself Sam is involved extracurriculars and sports and doesn't get home until 7 or 730pm. At least he's trying to do good. You need to learn flexibility and make an exception for school work.", "YTA also you sound like a right melt as well.\n\nYou're 29, can you not remember that you had to hand in completed Homework at School when it was due? It wasn't that long ago for you.\n\nHaving a rule is fair enough, but there's this thing called common sense that has to apply", "YTA. \nI'd batton down the hatches if I were you. His mom is (rightfully) going to down on you like a ton of bricks. Your husband might be spineless, but thank goodness his mom isn't. STAY IN YOUR OWN LANE.", "YTA. The rule itself, or at least the spirit behind it, isn\u2019t inherently bad. You\u2019ve got absolutely idiotic application of the rule. Children should never be barred from doing schoolwork or contacting their parent. You seem to be doing both simultaneously so congrats for being a double AH. Stop punishing him for being an active child and clean up your attitude, or your step son is going stop coming to your house just as soon as he\u2019s legally able to make that judgement - his mom will make sure of it.", "Huge AH. Preventing him from doing homework is actively sabotaging his education. Plus, nowadays, the bulk of homework is done electronically. \n\nWhat if he likes to read before bed? He can't use a Kindle, tablet, phone, laptop, anything but a paper book. I read a ton but don't have that many physical books (mostly first editions and signed special copies). Instead of killing trees to make new books, I can load thousands of books on my devices. Local libraries even have ebook programs to promote reading from the comfort of your home. \n\nSo he can't listen to music either? Unless he creates his own music via a single analog instrument like the ukulele or didgeridoo, he has to sit in silence? I fall asleep to soft classical music every night, unless I encounter someone such as yourself during the day, then it's death metal. \n\nAnd when you say \"family\" rule, you mean you forced this ridiculous rule upon everyone in the household because the kids definitely hate it, and I really doubt your husband likes it either because you said even he has to abide by the rule in the post description. \n\nI'm scared to imagine what other tyrannical rules exist outside of this one...", "YTA, sorry....I get there are rules, but sometimes in order for work to be done, these rules need to be bent a tiny bit. I think you should have been more understanding of the situation. It was home work, which is a legit reason to still be on an electronic past your electronics curfew. He wasn't playing video games, watching videos, on social media or communicating with his friends. And because of your lack of ability to see the situation as \"this is important\", he got a 0. That would be like if you went to work, and were told you didn't get your job done exactly at the time they close, or you have to clock out, so now you don't get paid that day. But also his mother shouldn't have yelled at you, she should have talked to your husband like a reasonable adult.", "YTA. Your reasoning and application of the rule exudes lesser intelligence than that of a 14-year-old. Yikes.", "YTA - good kids deserve flexibility. You\u2019re teaching him that following a strict rule is more important than him successfully balancing his life. Not the message I would want to send.\n\nI\u2019d be mad at you too. You\u2019re a jerk and you don\u2019t actually care about him. You\u2019re faking it and that\u2019s gross.\n\nMy brother was in rehab for drugs and alcohol by the age of 13 and he enjoyed hurting animals. Be thankful you didn\u2019t get one of those. Big time YTA", "Of course YTA. That's just a really authoritatively stupid rule that is harming your child's education. He already got a 0. Now he's got 3 more days of 0s coming because he can't do his homework. Great job there snowballing harm to his academic future just so that you can flex some sort of authority over him. Good luck trying to develop any sort of relationship with him if this continues.", "YTA There is a difference between the \"spirit of a law\" and the \"letter of the law\". And you are missing the point of a rule like \"no electronics after 8:30\". You say you're protecting the kid, but how was not allowing them to finish their homework \"protecting them\"? Plus, you told the child that if they stopped using the computer, then there'd be no consequences, but THERE WERE consequences, they just weren't from you. You need to work with the child, not against them - you are sabotaging them.\n\nIt's essential for parents to be flexible and understanding when it comes to rules and their impact on their child's academic success. By working together to find a solution, the parent and child can maintain a positive relationship and support the child's educational needs.", "YTA \n\nThere is internet surfing, and there is using a computer to complete a school assignment. You really need to learn when to bend the rule and when to stand firm.  Also,  as he gets further along in high school,  he is going to have to use the computer outside of your arbitrary times.  Being fair and flexible will be important if you are going to develop and maintain a positive relationship with your stepson.   Please don't become the wicked stepmother!", "YTA, wtf is wrong with you? It\u2019s homework. You are not his parent. Stop acting like a tyrant.", "YTA.\n\nRepeat after me.\n\nPreventing a child in your care from doing their schoolwork for ANY REASON is abuse.\n\nAgain.\n\n**Preventing a child in your care from doing their schoolwork for ANY REASON is abuse.**\n\nOne last time.\n\n***Preventing a child in your care from doing their schoolwork for ANY REASON is abuse.***", "YTA, some things require a little leniency. he wasn\u2019t playing games\u2026 he was doing his hw. you\u2019re a controlling AH with a stick up your butt", "Yes YTA!! You literally aren\u2019t letting your child do his homework and can\u2019t see that you\u2019re on the wrong?? You will 100% lose custody if you continue to weaponise Sam\u2019s education as a form of control", "YTA, these rules are ridiculous.", "YTA if your stepson is smart he\u2019ll start staying with friends later into the evening or ask his mom for full custody. I don\u2019t think a judge would like that your asinine rule is affecting his education, be prepared for NC once he\u2019s 18 if you continue this idiocy.", "ETA: I just realized you wrote that little snarky comment about him emailing his mother from a school computer. How dare you ever suggest he can't contact his other custodial parent. You can't take his phone in this situation because people don't have landlines anymore. You cut off his ability to speak to his mother!!! What if she's tracking him by that phone!!!

Exactly how is he supposed to eat, relax, shower, and do homework in 1.5hrs?  The rule is ridiculous and not appropriate for a 14 year old with what sounds like multiple extracurriculars.  You want to monitor screen time.....fine but you need to be more flexible, what's appropriate for one may not be for another.", "yta he in high school and was doing hw not eating crap playing around.  way to encourage a relationship w ur stepson. don\u2019t be surprised when he starts refuses to come to ur house", "YTA - he was doing homework and you were being unreasonable.\n\nI do see this being enforced if it was a repeated or chronic issue but it wasn't and his busy schedule explains the situation.\n\nThe spirit of this rule is pure and I think a good idea in this digital age, the enforcement however is archaic.", "YTA\n\nYour stepson was being responsible and doing his homework. You literally punished him for it. Your stupid rule, because it is stupid, can kick rocks. If you did that to my kid, I would be so irate. School before rules.", "He's gonna blame you for low grades.", "Yta no question. No rule should prevent schoolwork from getting done or contacting a parent.\n\nAlso the rule is terrible.

Family together time happens naturally, it's not forced.", "You and your husband are definitely the AH.

From your own explanation he wasn't spending the day fucking off.\n\nBest thing you could do is contact his teacher, explain that you actively stopped him from doing his work, and MAYBE they'll allow an extension so his grades won't be as impacted as they already are. Unfortunately for you, your boomer parenting style needs flexibility.", "YTA and Good going for causing him to get a zero. It was one time. You could have been a good parent, let him finish his school work and then taken it.", "Don't be surprised if the teenager decides he doesn't want to come back to your house after his next week with mom.

He had two kids from a previous marriage \u201cSam\u201d (M14) and \u201cZach\u201d (M9). My husband and I started dating when Zach was 4 and Sam was 9. I treat both of them like they are my own sons but Zach and I have a closer relationship. I figure it is because I met him when he was very young. My husband and his ex wife have 50-50 custody, 1 week with us and then 1 week with her.\n\nNow for the situation. In our home, we have a rule where there are no electronics after 8:30PM. This applies to my husband and I as well. We think it\u2019s important for us to have a quality family time for a bit in the evenings and to protect our young kids from using the internet without our supervision (the internet is a dangerous place for kids nowadays). \n\nSam is very involved in school with extracurriculars and sports so sometimes he doesn\u2019t get home until 7PM. Sometimes it can be hard for him to balance everything but he doesn\u2019t want to give up anything and we support him. 2 nights ago he came home at 7 and we ate dinner, watched a 30 minutes show, and then Sam went up to his room around 8. I planned to read before bed so I put my phone and laptop in the \u201cDocking Station\u201d early. This is where we put our electronics at 8:30. At 8:45/9PM I checked on Sam and he was on his computer. I asked him why he was breaking the rules and he said he had homework due the next day that he had to finish.

Turns out he emailed her from a school laptop. She was furious and I told her  that respectfully that at our home we have our own rules and when the kids are here they have to follow them. Also that Sam should have planned better to get the work done before 8:30. She yelled at me some more and said that this was not fair at all and that I was being a \u201ctyrant\u201d. After this I called my husband and he told me to stick to my rule but to not talk to his ex anymore because he doesn\u2019t want her to yell at him.

Give this kid a break. And if it's not regularly, you need to let him do his homework. It's part of life to be flexible and able to manage your day if it's stressful. He let himself have an \"eating&30 minutes show wachting\" break. He did manage his time well. His day is longer than the days of  many adults, and he gets punished for learning to manage that. \n\nThis 0 is on you, and you should mail the teacher and explain why Sam has a 0 in his assignment if you feel so comfortable with your rule!

He is a teenager living his life and learning to navigate through it. Not playing electronics after 8:30 seems like an understandable rule. But not letting your child do homework after this time is just wrong. It's not his fault that he has to do his homework on his laptop rather than on paper. This is how this generation works. Not only didn't he have any time to do it before. But also many teenagers concentrate better in the evenings& get tired later than adults. That's a normal physical reaction to puberty.\n\nYou're controlling this kid so much that his schoolwork suffers. He's the one paying for your irrational and inflexible rules.", "YTA.

I grew up in the 80's and this was less of a concern.  Most people didn't even have a computer at home back then, and for those of us who did, they were useful at most for typing something up.  Useful, sure, but it was pretty easy to distinguish between typing up a report and playing a game.  There was no Internet to distract you and no quick task switching to hide what you were really up to.  \n\nSo now the choice is between having a set of electronics that can ONLY be used for school and are locked down enough that they can't be used for ANYTHING else.  Good luck with that.  Obviously there are some time management issues.  Some of those issues are created by you.  You've got an active kid who's well invested in school activities.

YTA", "Pretty ballsy of the midlife crisis replacement spouse to start ordering around a kid that's closer in age to her than the kid's father. YTA.", "Him having to contact his OWN mother through a school email is disgusting, how cruel to remove his means of communication. OP YTA", "YTA", "you'd think OP is from a completely different generation, older than her husband's.", "I watched beheading videos when I was 11 or 12 by accident, this was 16 years ago, parental controls have got SOOOO much better since then, I'd say it's easier to be safe on the Internet now a days than it was before, you just need to do a bit of research and set up good parental controls", "The kid didn't mismanage by watching the show - it's part of their mandatory family time.  And I'd bet it's Jeopardy - on at 7:30 in most parts of the US, 30 minutes long - fits the description.  I've pasted below from her post:\n\n\"*2 nights ago he came home at 7 and we ate dinner, watched a 30 minutes show, and then Sam went up to his room around 8.\"*\n\nWhat struck me as really bizarre is that the \"family time\" is only an hour long.  What is the 9-year-old doing for the three to four hours between getting out of school and dinner time?  Are electronics only \"bad\" after 8:30 at night????", "What is this shit take, and why does it have so many upvotes?\n\nLiterally last night I prevented my child from doing their homework because they were clearly sick. They wanted to push through because they were stressed about getting it done, but I sent them to bed and told them I'd let their teacher know that they weren't well enough to do it. Are you seriously saying that was abusive?\n\n*Repeat after me*... There are more important things in life than schoolwork.", "He might had started the assignment but it might been a long one. I had a assignment that was 1-200 questions that was due in one day and the teacher was forced to expend the deadline because no one was capable of finishing it on time. I was able to do like half because I don\u2019t work and I did the easy question first but not everyone had that same luck as me.", "Am I the only one who noticed the massive age gap? OP and her husband started dating when she was 24 and he was 40 \ud83d\udc40 she's way closer in age to her step kids than her husband", "Not to mention poor Sam is a freshman in high school. OP is going to absolutely ruin his future. I honestly hope Sam chooses to stay with his mom.. he's old enough for his opinion to be valued in the court, and I highly doubt a court would consider forcing kids to get zeros 'bcuz my rules' in school in their best interest. 2030hrs is incrediby early in the evening for a 14yo who's getting home at 1900hrs after extracurriculars (that she made a point to mention he doesn't want to give up.. makes me think she said he had to give those up if he wanted more homework time.. like, what the actual fuck) ESPECIALLY if family dinner is mandated, the show together/family time is mandated, etc etc etc. She's setting him up to fail miserably just so she can feel on control.", "Lol you are absolutely not qualified to be giving people life advice .", "Those extra activities could help him get into college. It\u2019s not fair to impact his social life and/or his grades over some arbitrary rule. Not to mention that if the rule is so that they can have \u201cfamily time\u201d, why is OP reading a book instead of spending time with the kids?", "That's the dumbest fucking thing I've heard in my life. \n\nHe's 14. A freshman. On a 9yo's electronics restriction. The OP (and apparently you) would rather he drop extracurriculars to conform to her \"rule\" than grow up and recognize that he's not a baby, and high schoolers have homework. She mandates tv time with them but in the same breath says no screens. \n\nIdk when you were last in school, but my homework piled up every night, middle school, high school, and college. It wasn't \"time management\", it was 7 classes a day assigning nightly homework like they were the only class you ever took. Extracurriculars were how myself and my classmates stayed healthy, fed our interests, and maintained a modicum of mental health. \n\nIf he was going to be done by 2045hrs, then he manages his time exceptionally well.\n\nStop bullshitting.", "No OP doesn\u2019t want step son there and is playing the long game\u2026", "This exactly, OP making it so step son can\u2019t / won\u2019t want to be in his fathers care, father won\u2019t speak up as to not upset / lose younger wife\u2026", "I have had four kids within 20 years. If they continue to have kids that are active and do well in school, 8:30 might be the only time they'll have on some days to start dinner.", "haha \"life advice\"? This isn't life advice, it's common sense. Online assignments are a way more efficient use of time than say, the teacher collecting notebooks in which the assignments are done and manually correcting them.", "Yeah, when I was in a club it ended at 4-6pm when classes ended at 2:45. While my brother basketball practice ended sometime at 6-10pm.", "Then she can accept she is wrong, apologize and drop the stupid rule.

Reading while someone else makes hot chocolate and the kid does a puzzle. Good times.\n\nOP is definitely definitely YTA (obvi he has to do his homework??!) and it\u2019s not super *involved* family time, but I\u2019d still count it as such myself.", "Ahhh ya got me ! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I would\u2019ve gotten away with it too if it weren\u2019t for those pesky kids."]}
