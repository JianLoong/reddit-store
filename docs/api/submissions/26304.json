It's super funny, it's not like we're facing a massive rise of authoritarianism that does in fact want to police people's pregnancies, no it's a funny internet joke on an absolutely not reactionary subreddit! Hahahaha soooo funny!", "I hope you find loved ones who don't make you feel like that!", "no one talks about their kids at your familys gatherings? you just sit around and praise the birthday boy? as adults? cool I love learning about other people's fucked up families", "I don't know why you want me to praise you for not caring what people think when you have intuited correctly that I feel very strongly that caring is ok. You've read a lot into this short description of this woman's behavior. So maybe you've just spent time around people you feel \"hounded\" you, while I've been around people like op who took joy in seeing others' faces fall when they rejected a bid for affection. I don't see any main character syndrome here, and you obviously aren't going to get me to see it by stating over and over again that you believe wanting attention makes you an asshole because I don't feel that way and I never will. So like, congrats, I guess. I can't argue you out of your determined belief that this internet stranger is some kind of attention parasite, or even that being \"some kind of attention parasite\" is worse behavior than aggressive shaming. So - \"Gee, you're right, Thymelaeaceae, your belief on how it's ok to treat people that annoy you is totally normal and morally correct! How did you ever dare to fly in the face of public opinion to say it's cool to shame people for being cringe at parties!\" Have you got enough attention now?", "Once again, Laurel sounds like a much cooler person than me! I'd love to meet her, but frankly I think one Laurel is worth any twenty of the reactionary scolds who frequent this forum, and since I'm here I guess I'm one of them! I hope she finds better people to spend time with though!", "Oh gosh, starting a conversation? At not her own party? What will those awful, venomous women think of next in their bids to share their interests with family members!", "I think one conversation that people weren't interested isn't worth humiliating her about. If OP were just really tired of it not an asshole, they could have said to her later one on one, hey you've been talking about this a lot and the rest of us don't really have anything else to say about it. Announcing in front of the entire family that no one cares about her interests is just being mean for its own sake and that's categorically worse than \"attention seeking.\"", "You did get bullied for your name tho right?

Do you feel like you're not getting enough attention in your family?", "Of course we don't just sit around and praise the birthday boy. \n\nBut the topics of conversation are focussed mainly around the person whose birthday it is. How they are doing, how their family is doing, what significant events are coming up for them, etc etc. Of course we reciprocate.

Instead I got bullied for being \"weird\" (autistic).", "Kids will make any name into a bullying name, it does not matter what it is, if they want to they will", "I know a Hortensia (she's French of course) and I think it's a great name, in French, but the English version really does just seem...off\n\nPronunciation totally makes a huge difference, it's so weird, but kinda cool to think about.", "I'm not joking either, nor am I triggered.

A budding psychologist! And what stunning insights, must be a little genius we've got here!", "See, if anyone in the room cared it would be an entirely different conversation. A hypothetical person who cared about baby names and thought it was a bad one could certainly say it! Unfortunately we get no one like that in this post! Laurel's asshole family, who wants nothing more than to get her to shut up as soon as possible, should certainly not say it.\n\nYour second point I will not speak to, because contrary to many people's stated opinions on this thread, I am not actually Laurel and I don't need to write a fanfic about every possible permutation of Laurel's psyche to support the point that OP was a jerk. I like her naming style, honestly, I'm about to change my name to a rather old-fashioned one myself - not to seek attention, or anything, heaven forfend! But even if her names were terrible and she was being annoying about it OP would still be the asshole, because you don't get a free pass on being the asshole because you're annoyed.", "No, cooler because she experiences excitement and wants to share it with her loved ones rather than wanting to shut everybody down who's having a better time than her. But I'm ok on the grass front, I'm actually on a lovely two month trip through Europe right now and I took a great hike in the Tatras last week. I'm sure you don't care, but you know what? Cope and seethe. Since then I've come to Vienna and the restaurants are really wonderful, I've been going to the cafe every day for a slice of cake and a hot chocolate, it's been such a great time. You know what, maybe I am as cool as Laurel after all!", "You may not be able to read between the lines but I don't actually think there's anything wrong per se with attention seeking. I mean frankly, what's more attention seeking, the sister's conversation topic, or OP posting this to hundreds of strangers? I hope the sister was able to get attention from someone who was more deserving of her time and that OP enjoyed having their ego stroked by people assuring them that they can do no wrong if the person they wronged was annoying them at the time", "Well, yeah, that's true. And oftentimes when your frustration comes out badly it makes you the asshole, like OP here. Like, this isn't the \"I know very well I'm the asshole but everyone come tell me it's fine because she was being really annoying\" sub (well, it is now I guess)", "OP was attacking. Laurel said something a little rude and in response OP went straight for the thing that would be most hurtful to say in the situation. There's no comparison. The party at fault is always the one being needlessly cruel.", "Wow dude you're being incredibly cruel", "So, no? Are you getting the attention you need from this thread? Negative attention is better than none, I presume?", "I'm not reading all that fanfiction but I'm happy for you or sorry that it happened, whatever fits.", "Found the main character.", "Lmao does seem to be what a lot of people expect to happen", "Laurel was excited. You might want to try reading the threads before commenting on them.", "So now Laurel went from doing no wrong to only being a little rude? OP wasn\u2019t needlessly cruel, she stated facts it doesn\u2019t matter what your kids name is as long as it\u2019s not something offensive or outlandish. Laurel was fishing for compliments or complaints about her naming style and cried about it when nobody had anything overly negative or positive to say.  OP gave Tat for Laurels Tit plain and simple. Don\u2019t start things you can\u2019t finish, Laurel thought she was special and could say whatever she wanted and she got her feelings hurt. That\u2019s on her.", "NAH. You were telling the truth, for sure. And maybe she needed to hear it. But if she's this excited the least y'all could do- as her family, who is welcoming her new child- is be a little game to be excited with her. Clearly she likes a certain kind of name and wants y'all to guess. It's not your responsibility to be nicer, but it wouldn't hurt. It's not that big of an ask to make your sister happy.", "ESH. Your sister does sound annoying. You and your brother otoh, missed a real opportunity to needle her by guessing names in the right genre but slightly off base trend wise. Or just way way way outside of her style. Why bring us a boring family conflict when you could be telling us about how your sister threw a tantrum because you guessed Elbert or Hortense. Or Brynleigh or Ryker. A damn shame.", "Everyone knows that no one beyond a parent really cares much about the naming decision (obv exceptions of overzealous ppl etc). \n\nYTA for feeling the need to remind her of this fact, especially since it sounds like you were/are hurt by the sister\u2019s insults toward you.", "NTA, but also could you share the names you like? I\u2019m always looking for good weird ones, too!", "She obviously really likes names. Your family kind of sounds a bit rude?
