One or two maybe gave a guess but everyone told her they could wait until she and her husband were ready to announce. Her oldest, her son she named Theodore. Her daughter is Mildred.

I did not consider myself included in this because she did not look at me but looked at everyone else. People were like \"uh, not really?\" and things were ever so slightly awkward.\n\nLaurel asked why nobody was excited to find out her kids names and why nobody had a big reaction. Our brother said he guessed what her kids names would be like because of how she named her dogs; Dorothy, Stanley and Eleanor and he said she never hid the fact she likes really old names from anyone. Laurel was like what is that meant to mean (the really old names part). My brother shrugged. Nobody else answered. \n\nLaurel got upset and said she had expected a lot more excitement and enthusiasm from everyone except for me, because I like weird trendy names. But that she thought everyone else would say what a great taste she had in names. I told her nobody cares what she named her kids except for her.
