There are more reasons but I don't believe they are relevant to this particular conversation", "I would say that not wanting to be a BJ or a KKK is a different issue than grade school teasing, especially when kids can make a silly or demeaning nickname from *anything*.", "It\u2019s a huge decision to allow cruel children *too* much sway over, especially as they\u2019re going to be vicious in creative ways no matter what you name your kid. That said I don\u2019t think people should set their kids up for ridicule and I agree that if you give your kid a somewhat ridiculous name, a more common middle name would be good thinking ahead. I don\u2019t think \u201cMildred\u201d is ridiculous though except for being old-fashioned and old-fashioned names are in vogue, especially when the diminutive is a cute as \u201cMillie.\u201d", "Hopefully once OP gets off her high horse and apologizes. I would hate for Laurel to have to deal with someone putting her down and sticking to her guns about it", "So OP is an AH for defending herself? I guess anyone who isn\u2019t a doormat must always be the party at fault then.", "Exactly.  That stuff can have lasting effects.\n\nKids in middle school teased me relentlessly about my surname...even though it's totally innocuous.\n\nBut... it rhymed with a food product.  So it was nonstop: \"last name, last name not worth a foodname!!!\"\n\nIt was part of the reason I kept my ex's last name when we divorced.  At that time, I was still young enough that it still bothered me.   Those things can grate on a person even long after they \"shouldn't.\"", "Oh yeah, I think Mildred is fine. I wouldn\u2019t even have even been able to come up with \u201cMildew\u201d as a potential insult anyway. I mostly just meant that you probably shouldn\u2019t pick a name that you already *know* is going to get them bullied.\n\nFWIW, my initials are E.T. and I went to elementary school in the early 2000s. It didn\u2019t cause me any lasting emotional harm but if it could have been avoided, I would have greatly appreciated that from my parents.", "Nobody was excited, it was true she just spoke out loud what everyone was thinking", "I'm so sorry you had to deal with that, love. People are so mean sometimes, whether they're kids or adults."]}
