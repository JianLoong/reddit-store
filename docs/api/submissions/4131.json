It's like you guys wanted to be \"parents\" but not parent\n\nDo the kids care that sleeping bags were shared? If not, why do you care?\n\nGrand parents could have at least asked first.

You bought a house for them to live in so they could provide childcare for your kids while not being under your roof. I understand you paid for it, but it is their home and they have a right to have guests and also privacy. I don\u2019t think you can reasonably expect them to give up their entire lives and live under your strict control just because you paid for the home. They are providing you with a service and in return you are paying for their housing. That does not mean you get to control everything that happens in their home. If there is something your children are keeping there that they don\u2019t want to share, they should probably keep it at your home instead. \n\nIf I were your in-laws and you were this nitpicky just because you believe you have financial control over me, I would terminate the current agreement, move into my own place, and leave you to sort out your own child care.", "Your idea of all the little kids sleeping in separate guest rooms is so odd to me.

They don\u2019t all go to separate bedrooms and honestly that just sounds like it would cause entirely unnecessary problems in behavior for the babysitters/grandparents. \n\nIt should be a fun cousin time for all of them.

The kids probably wanted to sleep together. The grandparents should probably get two more sleeping bags so the cousins also each have their own. This is such a simple problem to solve for everyone that still ensures your kids never share with their cousins at their grandparents house (which is an odd goal).\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t really decide between ESH and YTA but am leaning towards OP being the one really over reacting and being the most wrong.", " Buy two more sleeping bags for the niece and nephew for christmas.", "YTA:  Mainly cause I don't know how having your kids cousin use their sleeping bags can jump to do it again my kids will never see you again.", "YTA IMO - Sounds like you\u2019re a bit of a germaphobe. if family sharing sleeping bags is something your willing to stop your in laws looking after your children for, then I think you should try parent them yourself rather than relying on them, as this seems like a reasonable thing that they did. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like it then fair enough, you should at least communicate that, as it seems like your reaction was way over the top for what actually happened (your kids sound like they were/are very much safe and loved for by these people)", "Did the cousins have cooties? Lice? Why would the sleeping bags have to be sanitized before your kids slept in them?", "EAH this whole situation could of been avoided by every one already having bedding, but hind site is 20/20. This whole situation seems so petty and I get why your husband says you're right but went overboard. It's sleeping bags for kids not toothbrushes. Advice for the future, run to Goodwill and grab a bunch of fun blankets and sleeping bags. This is what my family did and when cousins etc visited and no one cared about who's was what, there was just ample bedding for all the kids to sleep everywhere in a fun sleep over environment.

You can say you never said they couldn\u2019t have guests, but you are nitpicking and trying to control every aspect of what having guests looks like for them. If I were them and I did not have free reign of the home I live in because my DIL believed she had financial control over me (let\u2019s not forget you are paying for this in exchange for services they are providing), I would be out of that house so fast.

It just doesn't sit right imo.\n\nAlthough you and and your husband paid for the house, it is still their home. They also have other grand kids they need to think about, not just yours.

Forcing them to sleep separately is a bit harsh in this case as this is seemingly not something that happens very often. \n\n\nDefinitely address the situation and your concerns with MIL, but threatening to disallow her from watching your kids after this situation comes off slightly unjustified - especially in the situation you\u2019re in, financially providing for them; it may be perceived as controlling even if that wasn\u2019t your intention.
