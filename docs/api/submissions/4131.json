My husband felt the same so after a few months we bought them a house very close to ours. It's in our name but we furnished it and pay for everything except for groceries. The house has 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. The girls currently share a room and have a twin over queen bed. My oldest has the top bunk (twin) and the younger two share the queen. The younger two used to fight over blankets so we got them each a sleeping bag. My 4 year old has a unicorn, my 5 year old has a mermaid, and my 7 year old also wanted one and got an elephant. These aren't like camping sleeping bags. They're thick and extremely soft and the girls love them. \n\nMy BIL, SIL, and their kids (f6, m4) were visiting and the kids stayed in my kids room. I wasn't thrilled when I heard they were staying in my kids room but my MIL assured me that she would take all of the toys out and that the kids just liked the bunk bed. My kids were spending the night with their grandparents for one of the nights that my BIL and his family were there. I told my MIL that my kids would get their room and everything went fine until I got to the house with the kids and my niece and nephew were both throwing tantrums because they didn't want to give back the sleeping bags. \n\nI pulled my MIL aside and asked why the kids were using my kids sleeping bags and she said that the kids liked them and that families share. This is my kids bedding. I get them sharing some toys but not their sleeping bags, especially when she knew that they'd have my girls that night. They're too big for her to throw both of them in the washing machine and at that point it was too late for them to do 2 loads of laundry so my kids had to go without their sleeping bags. \n\nI told her from now on, none of the other grandkids will be sleeping in my kids rooms (we're giving my oldest her own room) since I can't trust her to respect their belongings and that if this happens again, she won't be allowed to watch my kids anymore. \n\nMy husband agrees that she shouldn't have let them use the sleeping bags or at least wash them before my kids got there but he thinks I went overboard.

You bought a house for them to live in so they could provide childcare for your kids while not being under your roof. I understand you paid for it, but it is their home and they have a right to have guests and also privacy. I don\u2019t think you can reasonably expect them to give up their entire lives and live under your strict control just because you paid for the home. They are providing you with a service and in return you are paying for their housing. That does not mean you get to control everything that happens in their home. If there is something your children are keeping there that they don\u2019t want to share, they should probably keep it at your home instead. \n\nIf I were your in-laws and you were this nitpicky just because you believe you have financial control over me, I would terminate the current agreement, move into my own place, and leave you to sort out your own child care.", "Your idea of all the little kids sleeping in separate guest rooms is so odd to me.

They don\u2019t all go to separate bedrooms and honestly that just sounds like it would cause entirely unnecessary problems in behavior for the babysitters/grandparents. \n\nIt should be a fun cousin time for all of them.

The kids probably wanted to sleep together. The grandparents should probably get two more sleeping bags so the cousins also each have their own.

Lice? Why would the sleeping bags have to be sanitized before your kids slept in them?", "EAH this whole situation could of been avoided by every one already having bedding, but hind site is 20/20. This whole situation seems so petty and I get why your husband says you're right but went overboard. It's sleeping bags for kids not toothbrushes. Advice for the future, run to Goodwill and grab a bunch of fun blankets and sleeping bags. This is what my family did and when cousins etc visited and no one cared about who's was what, there was just ample bedding for all the kids to sleep everywhere in a fun sleep over environment.

You can say you never said they couldn\u2019t have guests, but you are nitpicking and trying to control every aspect of what having guests looks like for them. If I were them and I did not have free reign of the home I live in because my DIL believed she had financial control over me (let\u2019s not forget you are paying for this in exchange for services they are providing), I would be out of that house so fast.

Forcing them to sleep separately is a bit harsh in this case as this is seemingly not something that happens very often. \n\n\nDefinitely address the situation and your concerns with MIL, but threatening to disallow her from watching your kids after this situation comes off slightly unjustified - especially in the situation you\u2019re in, financially providing for them; it may be perceived as controlling even if that wasn\u2019t your intention.

Toys just want to be played with.", "Info: who is going to watch the kids when you no longer let the grandparents? Do they get to keep the house?", "Wow control issues much? YTA it\u2019s sleeping bags. You might own the house, but it\u2019s their home, they live there. You can\u2019t tell them what to do with their rooms \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "You sound so overbearing and controlling, what's the problem with sharing blankets ??", "YTA. Were the kids going over to have a sleepover with their cousins, or to intrude on their cousins bonding time with their grandparents? Bc it sounds like your kids already see their grandparents a very good deal. 1-2 nights a week is a lot - that\u2019s between 13 and 25% of the month. Your family should butt out and let the cousins have some fun w their grandparents.", "NTA little kids are especially prone to drooling while sleeping, wiping their noses on their sleeves/bedding, and of course everybody sheds skin flakes and hair while they sleep. If the cousins asked to wear their clothes or shoes or use their hair brushes or toothbrushes would that be ok?", "YTA.  Throw the damn things in the washing machine after the family leaves and call it a day.  There are a LOT bigger issues in the world to deal with.  Now, if they were using the kids toothbrush or something, that\u2019d be a different story.  \n\n\nDo you bring your own bedding when you stay at someone\u2019s house?", "You bought your parents a *house* just so they could be nearby to babysit. By a couple new sleeping bags if it bothers you that much. YTA, the level of absolute snobbery here is insane", "Just buy some extra sleeping bags, it's not a big deal.....at all.", "Info:  So you bought your in-laws a 4 bedroom house but make your kids not only share 1 bedroom, but two of them are sharing the same bed??", "YTA. Why on earth does this matter to you?", "Lighten UP,  Francis. YTA not for having unusually draconian attitudes about the cousins touching your kid's stuff, but for threatening to remove access to your children for violating a boundary MIL didn't even know existed. You can't fault people for not following rules you didn't tell them about. \n\nThis wasn't even a safety issue or a health issue unless the cousins were crawling with lice or broken out in smallpox.", "Actually, if you care about others using your kids\u2019 sleeping bags, you should keep the sleeping bags in your home and only take them to the grandparents\u2019 home when you are dropping off your children. \n\nYTA for making a mountain out of a molehill.", "Info: do your niece and nephew have any issues in particular that might cause the bags to smell? (like bedwetting, trouble wiping, gas)? If so, I can definitely understand why it\u2019d make your kids uncomfortable. Especially if any of your kids are kinda germaphobic. (Like\u2026 my little sister used to have issues with nosepicking, handwashing, and bedwetting, and even at age six I was always terrified to have her share my stuff because I was a major germaphobe.)", "Is there something about the SIL or BIL that you don't like or understand? Are they the same.race, economic background as you? Do they have problems with addiction?", "If you can afford to buy the inlaws a house, you can afford a nanny. Your inlaws won't respect your boundaries.", "YTA. And chill out. It\u2019s just a couple of sleeping bags. Plus, you have major issues regarding sharing. You wanted your MIL to hide toys? Seriously? Seriously?!?", "ESH. She shouldn't have used your kids' stuff without asking, but threatening to keep your kids away from her just for that is a disproportionate response.", "NTA\nYou bought house for in-laws. Cousins want to stay in the kid room can be told NO.\nEspecially since in-laws knew OPs girls were joining during the visit\n-Granny I want to stay in the bunk bed room.\n-When your mommy and daddy buy granny a house and put bunk beds in a room then you can! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Look OP I get it\u2019s your kids stuff. But they are kids all of them. We used to share beds and blankets with family that came over and we didn\u2019t have the luxury of being able to wash everything. We survived. \nIf it\u2019s such a big issue teach your kids to put the sleeping bags away in a closet or a drawer for when there is other guest. \n\nIf anything else gift your niece and nephew a sleeping bag for Christmas and they can bring it next time. \nThis hill you are choosing is turning into a mountain and I promise you your kids probably didn\u2019t care the cousins used them. \n\nAgain they are kids and kids share germs it\u2019s how we build up our immune systems. Don\u2019t be that in law that throws a fit over a blanket.", "Oh wow I would love to read that one. Do you have a link by any chance?", "Exactly! I think that\u2019s a brilliant solution!", "It's not the MiL and FiL's house. They're just using it.", "Another ninny is not what this situation needs at all.", "There\u2019s literally nothing wrong with letting kids share bedding.", "God damn you guys are funny. \n\nWhen I was a kid I always shared beds with my cousins for sleepovers. \n\nOnce we went to a cottage for a little trip and I think we were 4 kids in huge bed lol", "If it's the one I'm thinking of, it's even worse than that. The mother was selling the house to her daughter with no fees (which I think is no interest) over 15 years with the agreement that the mother could stay there for a couple of nights two times a year. [Even had a contract](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3mde3/aita_for_pointing_out_that_my_daughters_house_is/).", "Then what will you do? Your in-laws handle the majority of the raising of your children. \n\nThis was a one-off sleepover with the other grandchildren and I suspect that is the actual issue. That your in-laws dared to show love, affection or care for anyone other than the kids they are raising.", "Who is going to watch your kids, then? Because it obviously will not be yourself or your husband. \nWhat kind of weird flex is this?", "The absolute best memories from my childhood involved staying over at my grandparents' or another relatives' home with my cousins. Our parents would just toss us all in a room and we would make a big happy pile of blankets and pillows on the floor. So, basically OP, you're teaching your own kids that their cousins are dirty, unequal, and not worthy of even sharing physical space with.  Impossible-Lynx2664 already said it, but I thought it deserved a little more context: 'You\u2019re an asshole, a shitty aunt, and a weird fucking parent.'", "Whats the issue? It\u2019s just a sleeping bag? Why you feel the need to control everything ? Do you feel like your niece and nephew are less of kids that they can\u2019t touch the things that your kids touch! You have many people here telling you how wrong you are yet your mind is already set that she is wrong. Not only that\nYou are very manipulative. Knowing very well that you MIL is pretty much raising your kid you threaten her to not be able to see them over a sleeping bag? No I\u2019m sorry is more than that is the fact that she has to do as you say or else. Yeah most definitely you are the a**whole here", "You should probably keep guest sleeping bags for visiting grandkids yes there is perfectly fine bedding but once the kids see the sleeping bags they want one too the same way your oldest wanted one \u2026 it\u2019s only natural\n\nNext time you should pack up items you don\u2019t want to share before they have guests to avoid any confusion\n\nAlso while there may be sofa beds it\u2019s really not nice to make them use that when there are empty beds\u2026 you need a better plan for next time", "Kids will tend to want to sleep in kid spaces\u2026\n\nDid the other children ruin them? Did they rip them or mess them with food or bodily fluids? If no, and if they aren\u2019t destructive maybe just learn how to relax.\n\nIf you can\u2019t share, then don\u2019t leave the sleeping bags at your IL\u2019s house. Have your kids bring everything back and forth every time just in case another child happens to be at your IL\u2019s house and touches them. But if you give them to your IL\u2019s you forfeit your right to dictate how they use them in their home. \n\nWe gave my MIL special blankets and toys for when our son stayed with her and guess what?! Sometimes his cousins used the blankets and toys when they were there. It\u2019s NOT as big of a deal as you\u2019re making it. You\u2019re making it awkward for everyone. Blankets are not that important that your lack of control over them will cause you to remove grandparent access to your children if they don\u2019t follow your rules for the blankets you left at their house.\n\nIt\u2019s manipulative.", "You're mad goofy .. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "In daycare, children don\u2019t share bedding and even mattresses or sleeping pads are vinyl covered and sanitized after use", "That\u2019s how a lot of germs are shared/ lice and other pests. It\u2019s better to give guests clean sheets/ bedding and wash it in between guests.", "Her in laws should call her bluff. She only has her kids 5 days a week and sees them a few hours on those days. She would be running to their house begging for her kids to sleep over. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the kids are at their grandparents house on her days off.\nYTA", "It\u2019s the IL\u2019s house, she has no say over it.", "Family though??? If my family members have lice I\u2019m helping them take care of that first. Then they can share the bed.", "So your landlord gets to tell you who gets to sleep in your guest room?", "Does your landlord get to tell you who sleeps in your guest room?", "Maybe your family, but some of mine you\u2019d have to do a deep clean after they leave. What\u2019s considered decent hygiene to you may not be considered essential to others of your family. And kids are Petri dishes. It\u2019s kinda important to help stave off those germs where you can and laundry is often one of the easiest ways to avoid everyone getting sick.", "Did I say that? No."]}
