My husband felt the same so after a few months we bought them a house very close to ours. It's in our name but we furnished it and pay for everything except for groceries. The house has 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. The girls currently share a room and have a twin over queen bed. My oldest has the top bunk (twin) and the younger two share the queen. The younger two used to fight over blankets so we got them each a sleeping bag. My 4 year old has a unicorn, my 5 year old has a mermaid, and my 7 year old also wanted one and got an elephant. These aren't like camping sleeping bags. They're thick and extremely soft and the girls love them. \n\nMy BIL, SIL, and their kids (f6, m4) were visiting and the kids stayed in my kids room. I wasn't thrilled when I heard they were staying in my kids room but my MIL assured me that she would take all of the toys out and that the kids just liked the bunk bed. My kids were spending the night with their grandparents for one of the nights that my BIL and his family were there. I told my MIL that my kids would get their room and everything went fine until I got to the house with the kids and my niece and nephew were both throwing tantrums because they didn't want to give back the sleeping bags. \n\nI pulled my MIL aside and asked why the kids were using my kids sleeping bags and she said that the kids liked them and that families share. This is my kids bedding. I get them sharing some toys but not their sleeping bags, especially when she knew that they'd have my girls that night. They're too big for her to throw both of them in the washing machine and at that point it was too late for them to do 2 loads of laundry so my kids had to go without their sleeping bags. \n\nI told her from now on, none of the other grandkids will be sleeping in my kids rooms (we're giving my oldest her own room) since I can't trust her to respect their belongings and that if this happens again, she won't be allowed to watch my kids anymore. \n\nMy husband agrees that she shouldn't have let them use the sleeping bags or at least wash them before my kids got there but he thinks I went overboard.

It's like you guys wanted to be \"parents\" but not parent\n\nDo the kids care that sleeping bags were shared? If not, why do you care?\n\nGrand parents could have at least asked first.

You bought a house for them to live in so they could provide childcare for your kids while not being under your roof. I understand you paid for it, but it is their home and they have a right to have guests and also privacy. I don\u2019t think you can reasonably expect them to give up their entire lives and live under your strict control just because you paid for the home. They are providing you with a service and in return you are paying for their housing. That does not mean you get to control everything that happens in their home. If there is something your children are keeping there that they don\u2019t want to share, they should probably keep it at your home instead. \n\nIf I were your in-laws and you were this nitpicky just because you believe you have financial control over me, I would terminate the current agreement, move into my own place, and leave you to sort out your own child care.", "Your idea of all the little kids sleeping in separate guest rooms is so odd to me.

They don\u2019t all go to separate bedrooms and honestly that just sounds like it would cause entirely unnecessary problems in behavior for the babysitters/grandparents. \n\nIt should be a fun cousin time for all of them.

The kids probably wanted to sleep together. The grandparents should probably get two more sleeping bags so the cousins also each have their own.

Lice? Why would the sleeping bags have to be sanitized before your kids slept in them?", "EAH this whole situation could of been avoided by every one already having bedding, but hind site is 20/20. This whole situation seems so petty and I get why your husband says you're right but went overboard. It's sleeping bags for kids not toothbrushes. Advice for the future, run to Goodwill and grab a bunch of fun blankets and sleeping bags. This is what my family did and when cousins etc visited and no one cared about who's was what, there was just ample bedding for all the kids to sleep everywhere in a fun sleep over environment.

You can say you never said they couldn\u2019t have guests, but you are nitpicking and trying to control every aspect of what having guests looks like for them. If I were them and I did not have free reign of the home I live in because my DIL believed she had financial control over me (let\u2019s not forget you are paying for this in exchange for services they are providing), I would be out of that house so fast.

Maybe she didn't think too much of it, easy mistake that can happen.\n\nAbout the guest rooms, are they child friendly? I feel like you can't really have kids sleeping in a couch or air bed when they are child friendly rooms in the house. It just doesn't sit right imo.\n\nAlthough you and and your husband paid for the house, it is still their home. They also have other grand kids they need to think about, not just yours.

I understand you bought those for your kids for very specific reasons, and that MIL\u2019s disregard for that is frustrating, but if this is a one-off I\u2019m not sure that such drastic measures are fair. \n\nIt\u2019s normal for the kids to want to share a bedroom and spend time together. Forcing them to sleep separately is a bit harsh in this case as this is seemingly not something that happens very often. \n\n\nDefinitely address the situation and your concerns with MIL, but threatening to disallow her from watching your kids after this situation comes off slightly unjustified - especially in the situation you\u2019re in, financially providing for them; it may be perceived as controlling even if that wasn\u2019t your intention.

Weren\u2019t you talking about that? Children share bedding in daycare in my country", "Yeah my cousins and I all slept in a line on couch pillows on the floor at all family gatherings lol. Adults tripping over us to play Santa and all. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s some\u2026.\u201dhygiene issues\u201d with the cousins that OP isn\u2019t mentioning or if OP is an only kid/didn\u2019t have cousins", "I grew up doing this to. We only washed the sheets because it was considered rude. Not because of germs. Than preceded to share a bed with my friends/family. I sleep with my cat pretty often (whenever he decides he wants to lol). He's probably pretty germy himself.", "Especially a SLEEPING BAG that was used for one night by a presumably clean little kid. Kids get slobber and snot on each other in the course of playing. A sleeping bag is probably the most germ-free thing they share.", "No, you wouldn\u2019t lose your license to operate it but it would be considered not okay.", "No? No, what? \n\nSorry, I think I am missing something. I don\u2019t get what you mean", "No kids in daycare do not share bedding. The people who license daycares (make sure the daycare is up to code, follows rules). Bedding is stored separately in individual cubbies, mats or sleeping pads are covered in vinyl to be able to wipe them down. These are standards that my daycare has to follow to be considered a safe place for people to entrust us with their kids. For guests, in people\u2019s homes, having them use clean bedding, sheets, blankets, etc. is considered polite."]}
