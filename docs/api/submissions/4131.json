They are providing you with a service and in return you are paying for their housing. That does not mean you get to control everything that happens in their home. If there is something your children are keeping there that they don\u2019t want to share, they should probably keep it at your home instead. \n\nIf I were your in-laws and you were this nitpicky just because you believe you have financial control over me, I would terminate the current agreement, move into my own place, and leave you to sort out your own child care.", "Your idea of all the little kids sleeping in separate guest rooms is so odd to me.

If I were them and I did not have free reign of the home I live in because my DIL believed she had financial control over me (let\u2019s not forget you are paying for this in exchange for services they are providing), I would be out of that house so fast.

Forcing them to sleep separately is a bit harsh in this case as this is seemingly not something that happens very often. \n\n\nDefinitely address the situation and your concerns with MIL, but threatening to disallow her from watching your kids after this situation comes off slightly unjustified - especially in the situation you\u2019re in, financially providing for them; it may be perceived as controlling even if that wasn\u2019t your intention.

Just let kids be kids and let them share rooms, share bedding and whatever else. It really doesn't matter in the big scheme of things. When they are older how do you want your kids to look back on their childhood? I fear that you will be back here in 15 years time asking why your kids no longer talk to you because they are fed up of having parents who over controlled, but weren't really there for them.", "I would put a big o lock on the door. Only you and DH have a key. Yes it will add a few  minutes to drop-off and pick-up  times but in the long run solves a lot of problems.", "Yta", "YTA. You paid for the house but it ain\u2019t your home. That\u2019s your in-laws home. You didn\u2019t pay for it because you just wanted them closer no you paid to have them raise your kids. What they do in their home who they have over and where them people sleep is actually not your business. When your kids when over they had a place to sleep. Btw the fact that you had to be assured that their toys were removed ??? What is that about??", "Piggybacking on the top comment. ESH because OP sounds like a control freak, but the grandparents sharing the sleep sacks without washing is gross.  Like, those are dirty sheets, essentially, that they've cycled all of their grandkids through in a few days. My kid sleeps in a sleep sack on a fitted sheet, and I would never stick another kid in his bedding without changing them, just like I would put fresh bedding on my bed if someone were to stay the night (and then afterwards change it again!).", "I know my cousins had a room at my grandparents and lived there most of the time because my aunt had really weird hours with the post office and their dad wasn\u2019t around. We all just shared and my grandparents got an air mattress and a queen sized bed to fit all the grandkids on weekends. My cousins never complained about sharing their room or the bed with me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird depending on the circumstances.", "Yeah it's the \"MIL removed the toys of the room\" that disturbed me. The kids are cousins, around the same age. It's a very weird family dynamic.", "For real. Whenever someone visited I was, as the youngest relegated to my brothers floor anytime anyone visited lmao", "Yes! And why is OP so selfish with her Daughters\u2019 things? Shouldn\u2019t they be taught to share? If there is something they don\u2019t want to share they should leave it at home.", "I get the whole not wanting the kids to share bedding. My mom\u2019s a germ-a-phobe; I get it. And,  it sounds like the little niece and nephew are still learning about respecting others property. They\u2019re still technically toddlers, so maybe we can give them some slack. \n\nBut, the reaction to grandma in this situation\u2026.Wow! \nThreatening to keep her from her grand babies for a small misstep is insane, cruel, heartless, etc. \n\nThe grandparents uprooted themselves to come and help OP\u2019s family. OP must have known ahead of time she wouldn\u2019t enjoy living with In-Laws. Come on!! That doesn\u2019t change overnight. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t OP turn down the offer? Why not have GPs come up for a few months? Instead they gave up their home and life they had before to move in and help. \n\nQuite convenient, that since they already uprooted themselves to come live with her, that they might as well just stay in her area. Help provide free childcare after she kicked them out essentially. \n\nYes, granted their home is being paid for, but a monthly house note is likely cheaper than paying for daycare for three small children, after hours care for those late work nights, plus emergency and overnight care during work trips. Groceries aren\u2019t paid for, and I doubt OP is sending the kids to grandma with a sack lunch and a casserole for dinner at her own expense. \n\nGrandma is so getting screwed in this deal and being taken for granted. \n\nBut, you know what? Screw grandma for not adhering to your rules. Throw her, her husband and their crap out on the streets in the middle of December. Maybe you can find someone else to be your unpaid help.", "You\u2019re right! Those in laws should move the f out! Let\u2019s see where they go.", "\u201cControl issues\u201d is a major understatement. I bet OP hasn\u2019t farted in years. Lighten up OP! You\u2019ll get a hemorrhoid.", "They will probably hire the nanny they wanted in the first place\u2026 the grandparents seemed to demand to be the caretakers because they didn\u2019t want the kids \u201craised by strangers\u201d \n\nCan\u2019t speak to if they will get to keep the house though\u2026", "Literally the only thing here i haven't shared with another family member including distant cousins is toothbrushes.", "From the sound of it OP doesn\u2019t shop at Walmart.", "My parents have turned my brother\u2019s old bedroom into a room for my nephew. They\u2019ve also converted what used to be a \u201cformal dining room\u201d (there wasn\u2019t really anything \u201cformal\u201d about it, but when they built the house the plans had a \u201cbreakfast room\u201d and a \u201cformal dining room\u201d so that\u2019s how they furnished them at the time. We basically only used it on holidays) into his playroom downstairs. They have him 2-3 days/nights a week, sometimes more but at least that many and it was just easier for everyone to make those areas permanently child proofed. Especially since it\u2019s just my mom & dad at home now and they have a 4-bed, 4-bath house so they definitely don\u2019t need all that space for just two adults who work full time. \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t find it *that* strange for OP to get the grandparents a house. If they are providing free childcare, I\u2019d imagine that over the course of their need-based lifetime, it\u2019s probably comparable to a nanny\u2019s salary. But at the end of it they can get most of that money back so it\u2019s honestly probably a smarter plan if they have the means to pull it off.", "Have you spent any actual time with children?\n\nYour kids pick their noses, play patty cake with friends, and then eat lunch.\n\nSleeping in a sleeping bag after your cousin doesn\u2019t even register on the gross-kid-stuff meter.", "INFO: Do you have any OCD?\nI genuinely ask because almost in all your comments you are focused on cleanliness, germs or laundry. And that it seems more important to you than your kids having a good time/bonding with their cousins (sleepovers with cousins or friends are often some of the best childhood memories) or being cared of by their grandparents.", "We're all thinking it but you don't gotta say it. Damn. Very YTA, OP", "Well they're toddlers, so yeah probably dirty.", "Probably the same reason hotels wash bedding between guests. I don\u2019t want to sleep in bedding someone else was sleeping in.", "> I can't trust them to watch my kids.\n\nAh, then your kids can grow more attached to the nanny you hire, instead of their grandparents and cousins, than they are to you. Excellent idea!", "Why are you so mean? My sister and I hand down clothes from our kids to each other. They share toys. Share beds during sleepovers at Nanas. They are cousins not the flea riddled homeless cats?", "Congratulations? I read the post too. They bought grandparents a house. They're still being snobby", "She said they wouldnt both fit in the washing machine", "Probably better for OP she never wanted her in laws to watch her kids in the first place, she wanted a nanny!", "Ok, Amazon, but by her description of them, they're still not super expensive, and someone that buys a four bedroom home in exchange for a part time nanny for three children  should not find having a back up of an apparently important enough item that it can never be done without for a night that is like $200 max if they had them custom made would be cost prohibitive.", "No, sheets are washed between guests for a good reason.", "That\u2019s why people wash children before putting them to bed.", "That\u2019s big for you to decide. Your kinda weren\u2019t sleeping there and she wanted her other grandkids to also be comfortable. Your kids aren\u2019t her only grandkids and she\u2019s gonna wanna treat all kids the same as much as she can. ALSO they are kids why would they pick a twin bed over bunk beds?", "It may not be the kid's room or it may be. Would OP have bought a big house if she didn't expect her kids to have a designated space there? A 4 bedroom is bigger than necessary for 2 retired people.\n\nI agree that OP exaggerated, but to me that does seem like the kids' room, given that there are other available bedrooms for guests.", "Thus is still the reality for much of the world.", "When my sisters used to visit when all of our kids were little, the 7 cousins piled all the pillows and blankets in the living room and created a prairie dog town style sleeping area. The dog would usually join them.", "Technically it\u2019s not! It\u2019s under OPs name and OP pays for it!", "Australian and used to work in daycare and we never share bedding its always washed and the sleeping pads have a vinyl cover to be sanitised between uses", "Sounds like my childhood sleepovers! If it was just 1 person we would use my bed but any more than that we would build a sleep palette (summer) or blanket fort (winter)."]}
