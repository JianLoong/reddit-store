Her actions also didn't help, she kept pointing out every little wrong thing I did and honestly she wanted me to do everything like her. Soon enough I started to therapy, honestly things were getting better slowly however I didn't felt better around people so my therapist and dad (52) came with an idea. My dad said we can get a dog since I have to go out for walk her and all, my therapist also agreed the idea. My mom isn't big fan of dogs and if my therapist didn't tell her anything I'm sure she would never accept it. A year ago we adopted a puppy from shelter when we bringed her to house my mom wasn't really glad because she wasn't beautiful enough. Few months later my mom's sister said dogs are dirty and we should leave her, my mom suddenly agreed even though my therapist told that's a bad idea and I'm getting better. We even tried to listen her and give away the dog after finding good people however she said no because I was crying and even promised she won't complain ever again.\u00a0\n\n\nLast night we were sitting and talking then she suddenly told she doesn't want the dog anymore and she done with spending her whole day around of her. Honestly me and my dad looking after her and we are cleaning the house for being sure nothing will bother my mom. I said I will get my own house next year so I can take her with me and she has to live with her only one more year and she lost it. She said we aren't love her and she isn't even important as much as an ugly dog in this house. We asked why and she said \"My sister hate her and I raised her. I can't let her go.\" She also said I'm always so rude towards her and that's why no one wants to be my friend. Honestly I felt hurt, I tried to explain her how she doesn't get it. She turned away and said \"I don't wish to listen now. I don't want this talk so let it go.\" I felt even worse because whenever I'm telling why our dog should stay she is acting that way. I finally blew up to her and told she is acting like a damn spoiled kid who is being pouty when they can't get whatever she wants. I also told she is only caring about herself and her useless siblings which can't even find a proper job.\u00a0\n\n\nShe said I'm an AH for treating her that way, also our few relatives told me I'm always treating my mom cruelly and I should stop putting my wishes above hers. The other half says I did the right thing and more than me our dog can't live without us.\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667233313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yignnx/aita_for_saying_my_mom_she_only_cares_herself/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is selfish, narcissistic and abusive. Stick to your plan of moving out with your pup. Your mom is likely the entire reason you are struggling with mental heath and the sooner you are out of there the better.\n\nNTA", "Super NTA. A good mother would never say something as awful as \"no wonder you don't have any friends\" to their child. Your mother is horrible and selfish and, as you said, acting like a spoiled brat. She is not a mother. She is just the woman who gave birth to you. You deserve a real mother. One who is nurturing, kind and understanding. This woman is not it. I'm glad you have your dad and therapist and can leave in a year. Make sure you hang onto your dog no matter what. Again, NTA.", "I feel so bad for you. Your mom is selfish, and isn't much else. NTA. Please watch out for your dog. I would not trust your mother.", "NTA", "NTA\nPut dog shit in something she loves or make her chuck out her sister XD jokes obviously unless \ud83d\udc40\nEither way the dogs helping it's technically a therapy dog and the fact she's trying to get ride of something that's supporting you just says everything, she sounds like a horrid bitter person who's never learned kindness. I hope you and your dad can keep the pupper and honestly be careful I wouldn't be surprised if she tried getting rid of pup or poisoning them.", "This right here. It's clear OP is right about her mother and she just needs to hold on until she can get out. It's going to be one tough year but hopefully both OP and the puppy can get through it. At least OPs father is on her side. NTA."]}
