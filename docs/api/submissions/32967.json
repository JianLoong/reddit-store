As far as my mil goes James and I talked about it and read a couple of comments together and realized he needed to put a stop to his mom. He called her and told her point blank \u201c No matter what you want we will not be having kids at the wedding\u201d!!!!! She obviously did not take well to it but eventually calmed down and said although she\u2019s not happy about it she\u2019ll just deal with it (lol hurts doesn\u2019t it) Anyway thanks again to everyone hope this is the update everyone wanted", "created_utc": 1702490162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hmqws/update_aita_for_fighting_with_my_mil_about_not/", "score": 179, "replies": ["I didn\u2019t want a wedding at all. I wanted a quick elopement and to spend the money we saved on a great trip and starting a home down payment fund. My father even offered $5k toward the trip, which seemed like a great thing to me. My mother threw a fit. My soon to be husband didn\u2019t want to start our marriage by offending my mother so we had a wedding. We invited a bunch of people I don\u2019t care about to make her happy. At the end, there wasn\u2019t enough money left for a trip AND starting to save for a house. So, we responsibly skipped the trip and saved for a home. We are about to celebrate our 19th anniversary and we never took that trip. Life happens- he was deployed multiple times, kids, medical emergencies, career changes. I regret not doing things the way we wanted.", "Might be worth having a \"bouncer\" at the wedding. Sounds like there might accidentally show up some kids anyway. Again I'm sure it will be completely by accident.\n\nBut I'm glad James stepped up, he's a keeper :)", "[Please Find Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18g0uhc/aita_for_fighting_with_my_mil_about_not_wanting/)", "Good for you. And good for James for having that talk with his mom instead of making you do it all. You had a united front.\n\nStill, I recommend passcodes and security.  I think that should be standard for all weddings. It should be in all wedding guides, asked by all wedding planners. A passcode will ensure your wishes never get changed -deliberately or by accident. Security will make sure the bridal couple doesn't have to deal with the unpleasantness that can arise when people act up at weddings and reception - too much to drink or just too much of \"main character syndrome\".", "I am glad that James stepped up and made his mother understand it was not her wedding.\n\nGood Luck", "Great. He's a keeper!", "Thats a good update and glad you got good support with it too!", "We eloped and got married in a hot air balloon with only our daughter in attendance. I do not regret it for one second, I'd do it the same way again. My husband and I are both Introverts, and that's what we wanted so that's what we did.", "Keep a sharp eye out on that situation.  Bossy MIL's tend not to back off, even when told \"No\".", "She is going to tell people to bring their kids anyway. Have security with strict instructions to escort people who bring their kids away.", "She wasn't going to bring kids, but the babysitter was accidentally sucked into an alternate dimension on the way over and there wasn't time to find another one.", "good bot.. i think?!?!?!", "Some heroes don't wear capes. \n\nThank you.", "Good human.", "Not a bot, but thank you!", "I mean. They could still be wearing a cape, we don\u2019t know.", "That\u2019s exactly what a bot would say! Lol", "apologies madam!", "Good not a bot.", "Damn, my secret is out!", "What if we are all bots?", "what a bot it?", "Yes, we are all bots.  You, a bot, figured this out? AI is real! ;)", "So pleased your man stepped up", "You are my hero"]}
