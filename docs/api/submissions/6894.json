Your wife might complain about using family money to buy the snacks, but that would be a great opportunity to point out that she wanted to sponge off (exploit) her teenage daughter instead. Daughter still gets her locked box of snacks. If this solves the problem, then great. \n\nLikely mom and relatives will not be satisfied either because they eat all theirs and want daughter's or because they don't want daughter to have anything that they can't take.

Are they thinking: \"You may be out of our house, but we still have rights to everything you have, which means everything your daughter has too\"? \n\nIf this is the case, the issue is deeper than the snack box.
