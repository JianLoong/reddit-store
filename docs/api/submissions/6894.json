I can't imagine the stress that would put on a teenager having borderline zero privacy. \n\nAs for the snacks I would order them myself and then put them in the pantry x amount per month. Meaning wife's family runs out then oh well they get no more till next month. Also as an apology to your daughter you could totally get her a snack box crate monthly subscription!
