You are right that this is MIL\u2019s money & she can do what she wants with it. This argument is between MIL & your husband, and your husband is an AH for dragging you into it. I get why your husband is mad about the money, but that doesn\u2019t make it his money. I gather that your MIL is not his mother, and that\u2019s something his father should have thought about when he wrote his will.

My husband was made to feel like shit and worthless, it's not just about the money. Your mother in law has TWO  kids and excluding one because she thinks he's less is just awful.", "ESH except your husband. Your mother-in-law is being ugly. If she plans to exclude one of her children from her estate she should\u2019ve kept that to herself instead of using it to fuel divisiveness. Your sister-in-law is being selfish and convinced you to speak against your own husband in order to justify her own greed. You spoke against your own husband when you should\u2019ve kept your mouth shut and stayed out of it, especially since you know that your mother-in-law does not like you. Your husband is very unfortunate.", "Need details on how you were cornered. You're vague there and it might be unreliable narration or might just be lack of detail.", "ESH I\u2019d remind your husband though that if she really doesn\u2019t leave him anything in the estate like at all he can contest the will", "YTA she can do what she wants with the money SHE earned, however, if this was originally her husband\u2019s/your husband\u2019s father\u2019s money, I do feel like your husband has a point. \n\nI feel that everyone should be able to do with their hard earned money as they please. But if the money is inherited from a family line, then that changes and I feel that the rest of the family line should also get to enjoy it and not have the oldest person be the only one to enjoy or spend it as if it were their money instead of family money.", "YTA you don't seem  sympathetic to your spouse. He's right too, if our MIL really just got it from his dad, its not truly something she earned. just b/c your MIL has the legal right to do it doesn't mean he's not being slighted.", "ESH, your husband sucks least, though. \n\nYour MIL is, of course,  free to do as she sees fit but *completely* disinheriting her son is still an asshole move.\n\nYou shouldn't have been dragged into the discussion by anyone,  which I gather happened with both MiL and SiL present  and while emotions were high.\n\nYou could have,  and should have,  been a lot more empathetic with your husband's pain and outrage. Again,  even though it's her *right* to dispose of her estate as she chooses, her choices are hurtful,  unfair and going to drive a wedge between the siblings and your husband deserves better than to have his feelings dismissed the way you have described.", "Your husband being basically disinherited because of lack of children is gross behavior on his mother's part. I'd be pretty pissed at her if I was in his shoes. Yes it's her money but it's still a crap thing to do to your own child. I'd be NC with that woman immediately.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: also she is deliberately setting her children up to fight after she dies. What kind of parent does that? It's definitely her money to do with as she pleases but she's a complete AH for not caring enough about her family to not throw it into chaos once she's gone. It's bad enough to lose a parent. Your husband may be so bitter and resentful that he loses his sister at the same time.  \n\n\nSupport your husband. MIL doesn't need positive reinforcement from anyone on this.", "YTA. Your opinion is wrong, and you actually voiced it, let alone in front of the people fighting your husband.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn these mtters, you should follow your husband's lead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou do not want to get caught in the fallout.", "\nNTA- you are right, she can do what she wants with the money. However, I would bet that his father expected both of his children to inherit from her. If that was a stated expectation, I could understand why he\u2019s upset.

It appears that when he died, he left his money to his wife, which is a fairly common thing to do. That means the money now belongs to MIL.

Even if it is split equally it can destroy families. My grandmother split her estate equally between her children and it still wasn't good enough for some. My father felt he was entitled to more. I say people can do whatever they want with their money. The problem is with the expectation. I don't care if my parents leave me nothing. That is their choice. I expect nothing.

Just because he doesn't have kids, doesn't mean he should be made to feel like he isn't worth anything to his mother, so I can understand where he's coming from.", "You said she doesn't like you.

Otherwise, OP\u2019s husband would already have taken MIL to court.", "I'm sorry sweetie, maybe if you explain the above to hubby he will understand his mom is trying to manipulate him. She may not actually go through with it if it really is a power play. She may also use this argument of yours to try to sow discord between you two. Best to show her a united front so she doesn't think her manipulations are working. Good luck."]}
