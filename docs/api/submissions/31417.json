{"id": 31417, "submission_id": "180hqzw", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she is the reason I hardly know her kids?", "selftext": "My sister and I have never been that close. As kids we got along fine, but she was two years older and thought she knew everything and at times it could be very annoying. As teenagers we really didn't interact all that much. In our early 20s we tried to be closer but she was very know it all and also looked at me as someone who was much younger than her, instead of a sister with only a two years age gap. We had some more issues when I got married first and then when I didn't tell her about my first miscarriage (she found out a couple of years later).\n\nMy sister and I ended up pregnant at the same time. She was due four weeks ahead of me. Two days before she gave birth my daughter was stillborn. She showed up at the hospital and offered her support, but was also very insensitive. She told me to focus on the positive and that her baby was due any day and would be alive and a celebration for the family. She showed back up in my hospital room the day her oldest was born, which was 3 days after I lost my daughter. I asked her to please leave but she didn't and she told me being around my niece would help me heal. My husband had to call a nurse to get her out. I was so broken that I couldn't be happy to see my niece.\n\nFor the following two months my sister was trying really hard to get me to spend time with her and her oldest and focus on them. She had three more daughters in the years that followed. I had several miscarriages in that time also. I actually never met her youngest two girls because I ended up avoiding any family gathering she would attend. Every single time we were in the same place she would feel the need to say I could get over my own losses with her kids, would feel the need to point out that I didn't need to be a mom because I had her girls. I asked her to stop, my husband asked her to stop, our brother asked her to stop. She would not stop. She got more insensitive as time went on. She told me I shouldn't be capable of holding so much sadness and grief when her children were in the world. I couldn't emotionally handle it. The whole thing was too much for me. It drove me crazy. I snapped at her once and she acted like I hadn't and proceeded to let me know that her kids should be enough for me.\n\nWith a lot of help, I became pregnant again at the start of this year, and my son was born not too long ago. My sister took it upon herself to show up and tell me I missed out on a decade with her kids and how could I justify not knowing my own flesh and blood, especially when I finally got what I wanted. She called me selfish. I told her she was the reason for that, that she was insensitive and cruel always ignoring my boundaries and pushing her kids on me when I was grieving and could not fill the void with her kids. She told me her kids are more than good enough and how dare I accuse her of being at fault. I'm the selfish one.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700575534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180hqzw/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_the_reason_i/", "score": 4582, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These dinners and events and what have you became a little more frequent until she was, once again, a regular fixture and she developed a really wonderful relationship with her nephew and subsequent nieces and newphews that followed. Years later, she had two more children - two amazing boys. I cannot imagine anyone in my family trying to foist their children on her during her time of immeasurable grief.

I lost my baby and she expected her kids to make up for that.", "Exactly my point, so not much of a counter?\n\nYou are describing someone who is clueless and ignorant. As narcissists frequently are. A reasonable person wouldn't have ignored that evidence. Sis did, she was ignorant of it, and clueless. Because of her being so self-involved. That's exactly why she's still accountable for it.\n\nBecause even though she remained clueless and ignorant, she had everything a reasonable person would need to not be.\n\nYou seem to want to argue that the sister knew better because people told her what was happening. But if she *is* a genuine narcissist, that wouldn't work. It's not a good line of argument to try to litigate what someone knows. If sis was told but believed those people were wrong, then she didn't *know*. She should have, but she didn't. If we make the argument about what she knows or not, we concede that it matters if she truly knew or not. Which I don't want to concede because I don't believe it matters. People in denial can be held accountable, if they had a reasonable basis to know the thing they refuse to accept.\n\nWhich is why it's not worth falling into the trap of debating what is happening in her mind (and that applies to any Narcissistic person you deal with.) She had enough resources TO know, if she cared to and acted in good faith as a reasonable person. But she didn't. And that's much easier to judge her for without trying to debate something we can't prove or know - another person's thoughts.", "Have you seen pictures of them together?

I gotta tell you, it *hurt*, it enraged me, and I *still* cannot think about it without hating her just a little bit more.

Would I really be able to give up on my desire to birth and be with children of my own if *I* was the one struggling?\" She's too self-centered to acknowledge how she would feel if her reality was different, because the one she is living in right now is the only one that exists in her eyes and the only one that is important to her. \n\nHonestly, I couldn't blame you if you disowned her entirely.

It is a form of manipulation in a lot of cases.  \u201cfor the last time\u201d doesn\u2019t even make sense in our thread.", "Yet sometimes it really is.", "Ignoring their existence and avoiding them. That's still her blood and the poor girls weren't guilty for their mother's sins.  And fucking yeah, OP is a TA as well.", "That's basically it. I for example have met people that are constantly telling others to set boundaries, to withdraw themselves from spaces that aren't being healthy or positive for them, etc. But when you draw a boundary to them, or withdraw yourself from a space they're in, then you're suddenly being unreasonable.", "Wouldn\u2019t go that far. There\u2019s no reason to talk shit about her kids just because their mom sucks.", "I agree this looks more like borderline personnality disorder (has the name change in recent years ?) Seriously this sister sounds like a pain in the but!", "I don't think she's bat-shit, just manipulative. If she had managed to convince OP that her kids would heal her, she would have killed two birds with one stone: winning the \"perfect life\" competition by being the only mother, and getting some free childcare by a sister so desparate for a baby touch that babysitting would be her privilege, not her job.", "And I'll bet you money that had the situations been reversed (meaning sister was dealing with a still birth and infertility), the sister would not have been okay with being the recipient of her 'advice' and the belief that nieces/nephews should be \"enough\". A definite \"I can dish it out but can't take it\".", "I thought that was common sense. It seems we're lacking more and more of that. \n\nWhen my SIL and brother lost their baby,  we wouldn't even mention the rest of the nibbling if it wasn't necessary.  Just reminded them that we loved them and were there for them.", "You are an honorable person for handling things like you did.", "Yes, but that's tough. She shouldn't have to cauterize herself when her sister is the tumor.", "I don\u2019t think narcissistic sister is going to like not being married if OP\u2019s sister\u2019s husband finally divorced her after having enough of her narcissist attitude\u2026", "1. Cluster B\n2. Don't diagnose people you've never met, it's really gross.", "> How many years now have you had to get to know them?\n\nThe same amount of years that her sister constantly overstepped boundaries and refused to let OP heal in peace.", "What an insensitive person you are.", "No, they weren't guilty, but they were being used by their own mother as a bludgeon against OP. Spending time with them would mean spending time with an asshole who *very* obviously doesn't respect her, her boundaries, or her grief. If everytime you're around someone, they make your life worse, you have every right to cut that person out. Sometimes that means cutting out people attached to them, even if they did nothing wrong.", "In that case, it\u2019s okay. OP having a boy will totally fill that void for her sister.", "Agree it may be BPD or Narcissism. Either way, it doesn't matter how many people tell her she is wrong and the selfish one, or which way they tell her, she will never be able to see anything differently. You either learn how to appear to agree with them and play nice to accept the peace (as long as it's sane and doesn't hurt you or if you for some reason can't cut off contact) or you go no contact. There is no reasoning or helping to see your side with these types of people.", "Right? My SIL out right told us that she needed some baby snuggles so we happily let her hold our kids. But if she had seem the least bit hesitant, I would have removed the kids and let her have some time.", "I appreciate that. I didn't do everything right though. I tried taking her and her husband out to a museum to get them out of the house but still in air conditioning since it was summer but I didn't realize that she was still recovering. She ended up almost fainting and I had to run around trying to find a wheelchair to get her to the car. >.<", "Ok, but tumors usually get cut out.", "The worst thing about this is, she probably doesn't. She's so convinced that what she thinks is right, that she refuses to even consider she could be wrong. People directly telling her otherwise makes her double down on it, because now she's mad that other people are talking to her like she's the bad guy, when if the sister just reacted the way she was \"supposed to\", there wouldn't be any problem.", "She didn\u2019t care about helping. She literally told OP that she didn\u2019t need to be a mom because OP had her kids to love and dote on. Who fucking says something like that?", "Agreed, sounds like OPs sister was/is always in some sort of imaginary (on her side) \"competition\" with OP to always be \"the better sister\" and constantly wanted to rub into OPs face that she got what OP always wanted, and now that OP has her own child, she can't rub it in OPs face that she's \"the better sister\" and is bitter about it.", "If you consider - 'sounds like' a diagnosis.. then you seeking more attention than I give to give.", "It always seems to start with the parents and whatever traumas they're unable to resolve or come to terms with before having children. It's always a crapshoot whether their kids turn rotten or not. It's why I'm grateful to be an old dad, given my personal circumstances. I'm especially grateful I'm not simply passing down more trauma (I hope!).\n\nIt's good to have that trusted relationship, your brother seems like a decent person.", "Was your sister the favorite? Was she the golden child?", "OP, I am so very sorry for the losses you have experienced. I would also like to extend my congratulations on the birth of your son.\n\nPlease do not listen to this person. It's clearly obvious to anyone with reading comprehension that your sister's actions forced you to choose between your well-being and a relationship with your nieces.", "Hi OP, I just want to say I\u2019m so sorry for your losses and for your sister\u2019s behavior. I hope you\u2019re not taking some of these chuckleheads too seriously. None of this is your fault. \u2764\ufe0f", "That was unintentional so not a wrong thing to do.", "Yes, that was the point. It's not fair that she has to lose access to her family because her sister might be there. By going no contact, she would have to skip the family get-togethers where her sister is included.", "It is easier to believe that the sister is malicious than to believe that the sister believes that she is helping and that everything would be \"just fine, if only OP followed the advice\"\n\nA healthy relationship dont work like that. A healthy relationship between adults means that you respect each others autonomy and  emotions. Pretending otherwise crosses so many boundaries and besides, it isnt possible to flip a switch and letting go grief. The sister forcing OP in the position of  \"She shouldnt be sad because she has wonderful nieces\"  and \"Dont rob me of my own nephew\"  is a very self centric and thus disrepectul view of the  situation.\n\nGrief and love can co-exist and neither of these emotions can be forced. It just creates more pain. The fact that the sister blames  OP for the consequences of her own disrespectful behavior is insane on one hand and on the other:   \n\n\nIf the sister was a rational and respectful human being than this situation wouldnt have happened. The sister tried to force situations and blamed the other not allowing them to be forced.   \n\n\nOP is NTA and I would firmly consider going NC.", "I think it's probably more internally convoluted. Something like \n- \"la la la I'm not listening there's no way this could happen to me\"\n- \"I am frightened and angry at grief around the most precious thing in my world (new baby) so I'm going to block that out\"\n- \"I am really self centered\"\n- \"it would be such a cute story if OP came and loved my kids and healed that way (plus free baby-sitting!)\" \n\nand then finally as the years rolled on \n- \"if I'm wrong I have been appallingly cruel to my sister. I am not a cruel person, therefore I am right and this would have been better all along if only OP would listen", "Narcissists aren't ignorant or clueless. They know exactly what they are doing and they thrive on being cruel and making others hurt while playing the victim, and that was exactly what OPs sister was doing. Thriving on making OP hurt just so she could \"be the better sister\".", "And yet you said everyone sucks here. So what is it? Does OP suck or are they an angel looking for sympathy?\n\nYou can't have it both ways.", "I\u2019m just trying to gauge the dynamics of the sister\u2019s family.", "I'm blaming her for a shitty Reddit post. She doesn't get to blame making shitty Reddit posts on her sister lol.", "Exactly! Am I the only that was on the verge of pissed? I equate that defense to victim blaming and shaming.", "Why would you need to know that? Don't push the topic.", "Oh, so you're just one of those people who has to find fault in things when there is none. Cool, enjoy your life!", "As an aunt you have no commitment to anybody\u2019s children. Children do not NEED aunts to flourish. She isn\u2019t taking anything out on the kids, because she doesn\u2019t have a bad or detrimental role in their lives.", "Oh you're one of those people who has to make pointless passive aggressive jabs.", "In YOUR Opinion. Yes kids needs a family to flourish. That includes aunts and cousins. Can they survive without one, yes. But having a complete family with lots of love gives children the absolute best chance at having a more fulfilling and happy life. Especially if their mother is not providing that for her children.", "That wasn't passive aggressive, that was on point.", "But what about the entire rest of the family? Grandparents present. Uncle present. Assuming the fathers side is present. I\u2019m sure parents have lots of friends. \nHaving one less aunt (due to the mothers lack of boundaries) is not on OP. Yes children need a community, but the responsibility to raise a child is 100% on the parents. Anything else is bonus. Especially, again, if the mother chases off the community", "> having a complete family with lots of love gives children the absolute best chance at having a fillies and happy life\n\nSo just fuck everybody who's a single child married to a single child that decides to have kids, right?", "I saw one of my uncles a few times when I was little, but he and my dad didn't get along, so I didn't see him again until I was 34. It didn't cause me harm, I don't have any lasting effects, I hold no ill will to either my Dad or my uncle. It happens. All families are different. \n\nOP did what she had to do for herself, which is what you're supposed to do, especially with something as painful as what she went through. \n\nShe was never mean to them. She never hurt them. If they have any issues from not having her in their lives, then it's because of what someone else it telling them. That would not be on OP. She hasn't done anything wrong."]}
