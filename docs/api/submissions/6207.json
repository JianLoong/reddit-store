It does not sound like a sexual thing, right? Anyway, the easy solution is for your gf to just not nap on the couch but in the bedroom, but the better solution is to just talk to the mother and figure out why it bothers her.", "Why are y'all making this sexual? You are introducing your young child to body shaming. Ick", "I do it sometimes, I have big boobs and sometimes they need extra support and I don't want to wear a bra to bed.\nI think you need to tell your ex to get a grip.\nI get it though you're trying to get on your ex's good books for the sake of your child.\nSo I'm going with soft YTA, but it's not a hill worth dying on.", "YTA. This has to be fake, right????", "I think mild YTA, this clearly hasn\u2019t bothered you before and you could have just asked her to nap in the bedroom. \n\nYou\u2019re maybe panicking because who wouldn\u2019t after finding out they have a kid they didn\u2019t know about, but it doesn\u2019t sound like your gf is doing anything inappropriate. I mean, it\u2019s perhaps on par with a man-spread or a bloke adjusting his junk. A bit weird but ultimately not something that would affect custody. \n\nMore likely your kid is just curious about bodies/things they haven\u2019t seen before.", "Y(the mother) TA. Any normal person would be fine with this. At 6, a child could be doing way worse. There's no problem with your child touching their chest (because it's theirs) and if they saw someone else do it then so what. If you're planning on having the child in your house at any capacity, they're going to see things that they haven't seen before in any capacity. You can try and change your partners sleeping position but what happens if the kids walks in when she's changing? Is the mother going to go crazy about that too? lol", "Wow, this is a heck of a spot. You have a custody situation coming at you \u2014 have you discussed THAT with your girlfriend? Was she supportive?\n\nSleeping in a \u201cdifferent position\u201d won\u2019t work. Sleeping in a different place might work better.\n\nExpecting her not to take a nap would make you TA.", "Wow, absolutely YTA.\n\nAnd your ex is being extremely insecure and jealous even making this an issue. It's how she's comfortable sleeping, everyone needs to quit projecting or trying to sexualize it.\n\nWomen have boobs. And you telling her not to nap is seriously ludicrous and absurd.", "What an odd request. You do realize that a sleeping person by definition is not conscious and therefore can\u2019t control what they\u2019re doing? If that\u2019s how she sleeps I\u2019m not sure how you expect her to stop. A more reasonable request might be, don\u2019t nap in common areas when the kids is here so he can play there. YTA.", "YTA \n\nBoobs can hurt when you sleep because when you move there's not much control over the pressure your mattress or pillows are putting on your chest and sometimes they get pinched or they are in an odd position (depending on how big her boobs are) also, for some weird reason, the warmth of holding them while sleeping is super comfortable. I don't do it everyday, but I do it sometimes and I wouldn't listen to whoever told me not to, my boobs deserve comfort too. \n\nYou don't want your kid to see it, ask your gf to sleep in the room with the door closed. An open door policy doesn't work if it comes at the expense of someone's physical comfort while they sleep.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nI don't even have words.", "Maybe a wee bit YTA, because you're sexualising an innocent sleeping position. I fall asleep with my hands resting above my boobs or my hands just slightly under the elastic in my pyjama bottoms. It's just comfy and nothing sexual about any of it.", "Okay I'm trying to picture this. Does she have boob pain and it makes them feel less painful? I have a friend who finally had a reduction because her boobs were so big it was causing really bad back pain, headaches, all kinds of issues. She used to clutch her boobs when she slept because they kind of got pinched under her otherwise. Is it something like that maybe? \n\nIn all honesty, as weird as it is, why does anyone care? Boobs are boobs.", "NAH. It\u2019s not like she can control it when she\u2019s asleep, but then if she\u2019s going to nap she should do it in a room where the kid can\u2019t see if the mother has mentioned it bothering her.", "INFO: have you asked your gf why she sleeps like this?", "Why is your child present in your bedroom when your gf is sleeping?", "If one is large chested, there comes a time when sleeping in a bra is more comfortable than sleeping without. Would your girlfriend consider getting a sleep bra?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

It sounds like you were very reasonable. Can't she just sleep in the bedroom with the door closed? She can get up when she starts to feel sleepy. Or use a blanket?\n\nEdit: I do understand this position and it is comfortable, but I would go in another room.", "Eh I'm gonna say NAH it's caused a bit of discomfort for the.kod so no harm in asking. Wouldn't it be easier if she just maps in the bedroom with the door closed?", "Holding your boobs, while you sleep is not even a little bit sexual. The ex needs to calm down. I\u2019m the father of a young son and daughter, and I would have no issue with them seeing a woman sleep that way. If one of them asks why she sleeps that way, I would tell my children because it\u2019s comfortable. There\u2019s nothing more to say about it.\n\nBody shaming your girlfriend is a major AH move. YTA OP. You should have stood up for your girlfriend and said there was nothing wrong with sleeping that way when your ex brought it up.", "She is getting a grip lol.  I sleep like this occasionally. The main problem is that when I wake up my hands have gone to sleep! Ps YTA it\u2019s likely the only way she can be comfortable if she\u2019s got big boobs.", "I also sleep like that but not because I have big boobs. I sleep on my back and my boobs get cold even with a blanket over.

No offence but if my friend showed me she napped or slept like that is probably laugh cos it\u2019s as if she\u2019s trying to preserve her boobs/stop them from sagging/thinks they\u2019re gonna fall off (are her boobs big? May need more support). \n\nIt\u2019s weird but\u2026 kind of really funny. \n\nTell your daughter not to sleep like that and your gf does it because she has a medical issue.\n\nWhen you gf naps, just throw a blanket on her to cover her holding her boobs so your daughter can\u2019t see.\n\nNgl I laughed at the mental image of her sleeping holding her boobs like they were going to fall off if she didn\u2019t hold them in place", "Exactly.
