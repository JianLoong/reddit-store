It does not sound like a sexual thing, right? Anyway, the easy solution is for your gf to just not nap on the couch but in the bedroom, but the better solution is to just talk to the mother and figure out why it bothers her.", "Why are y'all making this sexual? You are introducing your young child to body shaming. Ick", "I do it sometimes, I have big boobs and sometimes they need extra support and I don't want to wear a bra to bed.\nI think you need to tell your ex to get a grip.\nI get it though you're trying to get on your ex's good books for the sake of your child.\nSo I'm going with soft YTA, but it's not a hill worth dying on.", "YTA. This has to be fake, right????", "I think mild YTA, this clearly hasn\u2019t bothered you before and you could have just asked her to nap in the bedroom. \n\nYou\u2019re maybe panicking because who wouldn\u2019t after finding out they have a kid they didn\u2019t know about, but it doesn\u2019t sound like your gf is doing anything inappropriate. I mean, it\u2019s perhaps on par with a man-spread or a bloke adjusting his junk. A bit weird but ultimately not something that would affect custody. \n\nMore likely your kid is just curious about bodies/things they haven\u2019t seen before.", "Y(the mother) TA. Any normal person would be fine with this. At 6, a child could be doing way worse. There's no problem with your child touching their chest (because it's theirs) and if they saw someone else do it then so what. If you're planning on having the child in your house at any capacity, they're going to see things that they haven't seen before in any capacity. You can try and change your partners sleeping position but what happens if the kids walks in when she's changing? Is the mother going to go crazy about that too? lol", "Wow, this is a heck of a spot. You have a custody situation coming at you \u2014 have you discussed THAT with your girlfriend? Was she supportive?\n\nSleeping in a \u201cdifferent position\u201d won\u2019t work. Sleeping in a different place might work better.\n\nExpecting her not to take a nap would make you TA.", "Wow, absolutely YTA.\n\nAnd your ex is being extremely insecure and jealous even making this an issue. It's how she's comfortable sleeping, everyone needs to quit projecting or trying to sexualize it.\n\nWomen have boobs. And you telling her not to nap is seriously ludicrous and absurd.", "What an odd request. You do realize that a sleeping person by definition is not conscious and therefore can\u2019t control what they\u2019re doing? If that\u2019s how she sleeps I\u2019m not sure how you expect her to stop. A more reasonable request might be, don\u2019t nap in common areas when the kids is here so he can play there. YTA.", "YTA \n\nBoobs can hurt when you sleep because when you move there's not much control over the pressure your mattress or pillows are putting on your chest and sometimes they get pinched or they are in an odd position (depending on how big her boobs are) also, for some weird reason, the warmth of holding them while sleeping is super comfortable. I don't do it everyday, but I do it sometimes and I wouldn't listen to whoever told me not to, my boobs deserve comfort too. \n\nYou don't want your kid to see it, ask your gf to sleep in the room with the door closed. An open door policy doesn't work if it comes at the expense of someone's physical comfort while they sleep.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nI don't even have words.", "Maybe a wee bit YTA, because you're sexualising an innocent sleeping position. I fall asleep with my hands resting above my boobs or my hands just slightly under the elastic in my pyjama bottoms. It's just comfy and nothing sexual about any of it.", "Okay I'm trying to picture this. Does she have boob pain and it makes them feel less painful? I have a friend who finally had a reduction because her boobs were so big it was causing really bad back pain, headaches, all kinds of issues. She used to clutch her boobs when she slept because they kind of got pinched under her otherwise. Is it something like that maybe? \n\nIn all honesty, as weird as it is, why does anyone care? Boobs are boobs.", "NAH. It\u2019s not like she can control it when she\u2019s asleep, but then if she\u2019s going to nap she should do it in a room where the kid can\u2019t see if the mother has mentioned it bothering her.", "INFO: have you asked your gf why she sleeps like this?", "Why is your child present in your bedroom when your gf is sleeping?", "If one is large chested, there comes a time when sleeping in a bra is more comfortable than sleeping without.

It sounds like you were very reasonable. Can't she just sleep in the bedroom with the door closed? She can get up when she starts to feel sleepy. Or use a blanket?\n\nEdit: I do understand this position and it is comfortable, but I would go in another room.", "Eh I'm gonna say NAH it's caused a bit of discomfort for the.kod so no harm in asking. Wouldn't it be easier if she just maps in the bedroom with the door closed?", "Holding your boobs, while you sleep is not even a little bit sexual. The ex needs to calm down. I\u2019m the father of a young son and daughter, and I would have no issue with them seeing a woman sleep that way. If one of them asks why she sleeps that way, I would tell my children because it\u2019s comfortable. There\u2019s nothing more to say about it.\n\nBody shaming your girlfriend is a major AH move. YTA OP. You should have stood up for your girlfriend and said there was nothing wrong with sleeping that way when your ex brought it up.", "She is getting a grip lol.  I sleep like this occasionally. The main problem is that when I wake up my hands have gone to sleep! Ps YTA it\u2019s likely the only way she can be comfortable if she\u2019s got big boobs.", "I also sleep like that but not because I have big boobs.

No offence but if my friend showed me she napped or slept like that is probably laugh cos it\u2019s as if she\u2019s trying to preserve her boobs/stop them from sagging/thinks they\u2019re gonna fall off (are her boobs big? May need more support). \n\nIt\u2019s weird but\u2026 kind of really funny. \n\nTell your daughter not to sleep like that and your gf does it because she has a medical issue.\n\nWhen you gf naps, just throw a blanket on her to cover her holding her boobs so your daughter can\u2019t see.\n\nNgl I laughed at the mental image of her sleeping holding her boobs like they were going to fall off if she didn\u2019t hold them in place", "Exactly. Kids don't care about things unless their parents do.", "They\u2019re not", "So your gf also just found out you have a 6 y/o child and has been totally fine and supportive with visitation and possible future 50% custody.

My spouse calls it my Vampira sleep, because sometimes I will be flat on my back, arms crossed cupping my chest, like an old-timey vampire in a coffin. I bet you sleep weird too, dude. It\u2019s sleep.", "Yta.\n\nSelfish and over accommodating.\n\nYour gf has a comfy sleeping position and you want to change that because your ex is unhinged and sounds like spiteful if she wants to use this as a weapon on a custody agreement. \n\nYou and your ex are sexualizing a sleeping position. Grow up.", "YTA maybe she needs the extra support? Not sure what the big deal is about her position. \n\nI am shocked you would even ask her to do this. Not letting her be comfortable in the home.", "Yta. For listening to baby momma and disregarding your OWN GF", "YTA\n\nSometimes it's the only comfortable way to sleep for we who are blessed in the chest. \n\nI will say however, really soft yoga bras have been a game changer in sleep comfort - no wires so nothing can dig in, with just enough support that your tits aren't swinging below your knees. Not for everyone though, and lots of people don't want to wear a bra to bed.", "Soft YTA.

Just have her nap in the bedroom.", "Mine are average and I didn\u2019t know this was a thing to hold them during sleep. Huh. I get that you\u2019re trying to figure things out and don\u2019t want to mess things up with your kid and kids mom. That\u2019s admirable. Perhaps you have a bit too much going on and need to step back if this is getting you upset? Your gf should be able to sleep how she always has.

Unless her tits are actually out in plain view of the child, you have absolutely no leg to stand on. Yta", "YTA it is not uncommon for people to sleep with their hands, or arms across their chest. My husband sleeps just like a vampire in a coffin. A lot of women have big boobs and some of the fat goes upwards and squashes the throat and you have to push the boobs down to stop the strangulation feel. You are turning this into a huge deal and getting hung up on tiny quirks that are no big deal. If your girlfriend treats your child well, is all that matters.", "YTA", "You should have just asked your girlfriend to nap in her bed instead of the living room when your kid is around.\n\nKid won't see her, kid won't minic her, girlfriend still gets to sleep the way that's comfortable to her, ex calms down, everyone moves on with their lives", "YTA. You and your ex need to calm down. It's just weird.", "YTA. I hold mine because nipples are sensitive to the cold, and this keeps them warm and helps me fall asleep.

It\u2019s a temperature and sensory thing.", "On one side, you have your GF who\u2019s been super supportive (encouraging and helpful, per your comments) since finding out about your child.\n\n\nOn the other side, you have a baby mama who **kept your child from you for 6 YEARS**, and is now complaining about how your GF naps?\n\n\nAnd you really thought the correct side was the baby mama.  Huh.", "You could have cracked a \u201cshe\u2019s a vampire joke\u201d (sleeping during the day, sort of coffin position) offered to hold them for her (preferably when the kid\u2019s not around), or told the kids people sleep in different ways. \n\nInstead YTA who made her feel like a weirdo.", "I think ESH. \n\nYour girlfriend should NOT be sleeping in the living room in the middle of the day. That\u2019s just disrespectful to the other people in the house who feel pressure to be quiet and restrict their use of a communal area. \n\nYour girlfriend should be able sleep however she wants\u2014she can sleep naked spread eagle as long as she does it in her bed in the privacy of her own bedroom.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t indulge your ex\u2019s body shaming BS. There is literally nothing wrong with how your partner sleeps and you need to stand up for her. Teach your kid that some people just sleep differently than others. If you feel your ex would withhold your kid, then you need to get a legal custody agreement if you don\u2019t have one already, stat.", "YTA\n\nHer sleeping in de position is not a sexual thing. She is either supporting her breasts or perhaps a comforting thing or a way to position her hands (since hands and arms are fucking weird and awkward things to have when you try to sleep).\n\nAs long as she is properly dressed, this should not be a problem. Ask your girlfriend what her reason is and explain this reason to the child and their mother.\n\nWhen your girlfriend naps on the couch she could also consider covering herself up with a blanket.\n\nJust be open and honest about it. It is completely natural for everyone to have completely different sleep habits and positions. It isn't weird or sexual in any way and it should not be made to feel that way. Let the kid be curious and simply teach them things. This doesn't need to have any consequence for custody either.", "They may be sharing a bedroom with the son, after all he was a surprise and most people don't fork out for an extra room.", "I kinda fold my arms often when i sleep. If i now think about, it could look as if i hold my boobs. \n\nAnd sometimes i doze of with one of my birds. He always sits on my boob (his choice). The ex would mostly clutch her pearls if she see this.", "I read it more as OP really wants 50-50 custody of his child, and wants to be present in the child's life, so he's worried that his ex will make a huge deal about this to the judge and claim it makes him an unfit parent/\"unsafe environment\" for the child, and OP won't get his custody.\n\nI personally doubt a judge would see things that way, but I completely understand being afraid of losing access to your kid.", "Sleeping in a bra is absolutely not comfortable at all. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s common to joke about taking pants and bras off when a woman gets home \u2014 it\u2019s so much more comfortable.", "I\u2019m an F cup and I beg to differ. Sleeping in bras sucks major ass.", "And yet your the one sexualising her body and the way she sleeps? She doesn\u2019t need to sleep anywhere else and there is nothing even remotely sexual about napping on a sofa so why would you push a stupid issue on your supportive partner like that? Sleeping on the sofa isn\u2019t an issue, discussing your partners sleeping positions with your ex is!", "Lol, sorry about the downvotes mate. \n\nIf it's any consolation I thought it was funny."]}
