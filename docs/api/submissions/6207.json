You are introducing your young child to body shaming.

Any normal person would be fine with this. At 6, a child could be doing way worse. There's no problem with your child touching their chest (because it's theirs) and if they saw someone else do it then so what. If you're planning on having the child in your house at any capacity, they're going to see things that they haven't seen before in any capacity. You can try and change your partners sleeping position but what happens if the kids walks in when she's changing? Is the mother going to go crazy about that too? lol", "Wow, this is a heck of a spot. You have a custody situation coming at you \u2014 have you discussed THAT with your girlfriend? Was she supportive?\n\nSleeping in a \u201cdifferent position\u201d won\u2019t work.

I don't do it everyday, but I do it sometimes and I wouldn't listen to whoever told me not to, my boobs deserve comfort too. \n\nYou don't want your kid to see it, ask your gf to sleep in the room with the door closed.

I have a friend who finally had a reduction because her boobs were so big it was causing really bad back pain, headaches, all kinds of issues.

While I can comprehend the fear you might feel at what your ex might do when you attempt to gain 50/50 custody, you should be speaking to a custody attorney and looking to capitalize on your ex's body shaming to show that her environment is less safe for your child than yours is.\n\nSure, you might also consider asking your g/f to sleep in the bedroom instead of a public space, so that the public space can be used by the child for whatever they're doing. It might save you from future conflict over the child being noisy and waking your g/f (or future fiance/spouse.) But you should frame in that way.\n\nHow someone sleeps is mostly unconscious. You can adjust behavior through conscious training (I used to clench my jaw when I slept. After being diagnosed with sleep apnea I started practicing relaxing my jaw so as to increase airflow while sleeping, in addition to a CPAP. I still sometimes clench, but I am better about it.) But why should someone who likely has completely legitimate reasons for sleeping a particular way be forced to change their behavior if it's not hurting anyone and not inappropriate?\n\nINFO: \"holding her boobs\" sounds like arms crossed on her chest, supporting her breasts. But it is an ambiguous description. If she's not hands-on-breasts why would you phrase is so ambiguously? I used to sleep like this (arms crossed) and I'm male. I don't anymore as I've grown older and require a different posture to avoid my limbs losing circulation.\n\nINFO: You state you've told your girlfriend you want 50/50 custody, but you don't share how she's responded. If she's not supportive of that, this might be her way of tell you how she feels about that plan. Or maybe she's entirely supportive but doesn't like being belittled because of the way she sleeps. Insufficient information to assess.\n\nEither way, your ex is an AH here for sexualizing something for a 6 year old child. Also, your ex doesn't get to judge your current g/f. She gave up all rights to you when she separated. The kid between you is not a cudgel to change who you are and should not be used as such.\n\nImitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and most likely what your ex is mostly irritated about is your kid patterning any behavior after the \"replacement mom.\" Sounds like she has security and control issues.\n\nAnd you're the AH for not discussing with your g/f the real concern-- that your ex seems to be planning to do whatever she can to prevent you from getting 50/50 custody.", "Why are you sexualizing her boobs so much?

It's about being comfortable not sex.", "Why don't you just put a blanket over your girlfriend while she naps?", "YTA. \nAlso why are you waiting \u201ctill you get married\u201d to get 50/50 custody\u2026 so your girlfriend can be a babysitter?! Either you want to parent or you don\u2019t.", "INFO: Op when you and you gf sleep in same bed to hold each other?? Odd question I know. \n\nYou gf might use to holding something  while she sleeps", "NAH ( except your ex but I figure we are judging you and your GF\n\n\nAs long as you understand that your ex is being crazy and making things werid for no reason I don't see you trying to keep the peace as bad ... I mean your ex kept your child form your for YEARS eithier she had a good reason and you better have a perfect record for court to show you have changed OR she had no reason and is a crazy person who will blow any little thing into a giant situation so better to knuckle under for now.\n\nYour GF has the right to be annoyed but ultimately  I don't think asking her to change her sleeping position OR go sleep in a bedroom ( which should have been the ask rather then in a different position or not sleep) just for a little while until you have a court document so your ex can't keep your kids away", "During a custody battle keeping conflict to a minimum can save 10\u2019s of thousands of dollars and can make the difference between days a week he gets to spend with his child. Yes- ex should mind her own business but this is not the time for him to tell her that. GF can just nap in her bed with the door closed and he can tell ex he addressed it. Boundaries can be set later after a custody agreement is in place.", "I think a better framing is that he's negotiating with a terrorist. Baby Mamma, absent a court approved custody agreement, has all the power. If he tries to push back on her, he never gets to see the kid again. \n\nHe's not siding with the baby mama, he's giving a mugger his wallet so he doesn't get shot.", "Finally someone said it  haha  it was the first thing I thought", "I can just imagine the baby momma bringing this up in court. It's absurd. She sleeps how she sleeps. BFD.", "That\u2019s actually a really valid point.  I\u2019m so angry at that lady.  I assume she had reasons that made sense to her, but ugggggh", "The court would absolutely not care", "Unless he has a court approved custody agreement, or a lot of money to throw at a lawyer, that might be the last thing he ever says to the kid", "Yea, I noticed that this detail was getting overlooked a lot, I've had a few friends go through custody issues and it can get really bad if the mom has a lawyer who enables her or courts aren't involved", "Exactly!  It\u2019s likely that the kid is copying the position because the kid likes the gf and wants to do things the same way, its more weird that the kid\u2019s mom is trying to monitor sleeping positions", "It's probably one of 2 reasons \n\nShe either wants a free long term sitter, or she wants child support. \n\nOutside chance so the kid and dad can have a relationship, Outside because if that's why, why wait", "I sleep like that naturally, I wouldn\u2019t be able to change it because I get into that position while I\u2019m asleep. I think you have more than enough ammo with the fact that your ex hid your child from you for six years. YTA", "If you let your ex girlfriend control your home now with something so petty and normal IF you ever get 50/50 she is going to make your life hell because youve set that standard now. It is your home and your gf isn\u2019t doing anything inappropriate. Stand up for your home and your girlfriend and have the conversation with the child and answer any questions and provide context that it shouldn\u2019t be done in public etc.", "NTA I think you're probably really excited and new to all this, and freaking out trying to make sure you get to have your child in your life. I understand trying to ask the ex/mother for anything could easily be the wrong move if you want to stay on her good side to have access to your baby. Can't your girlfriend just put a blanket over her before she gets into whatever sleeping position she wants? Then she can hold her boobs while child doesn't go back to mom reporting anything damning for you.", "YTA\n\nSometimes a cigar is just a cigar.\n\nDid it ever occur to you that the position she is sleeping in is very comfortable with her?  Better yet, would you be happy getting slapped in the face if you change your position?  Or how about you feel pain in say your nether region cause it was tugged in a very painful way, think you would like that?\n\nWhile you did not say it, but it sounds like your gf is endowed topside and this is probably a way for her to sleep in comfort without having to worry about either getting slapped in the face, or feeling pain cause she shifted in the middle of the night.  '\n\nI am a guy, do while I may not understand all of the problems that a woman has, I do understand that one of them happens to be with large breasts that are hard to find a bra that fits comfortably and that sleeping becomes an issue, or back issues do to the size and weight.\n\nYour ex is an idiot, not everything is about sex.", "YTA. I rock myself to sleep whilst holding my balls or crossing my arms like a vampire. What\u2019s it to you and your ex how people go to sleep?", "A judge decides custody not your girlfriend's boobs.", "I have itty bitties and fall asleep with my hands on my chest.  My husband also falls asleep with his hands on his own chest sometimes.  What on gods earth is your daughters mother banging on about?  She sounds insane.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  YTA.", "INFO: How and why are you just finding out about the child?", "YTA... her sleeping position is not inappropriate", "YTA.\n\nWow you didn't know your own child existed for 6 years and now you want to play morality police? While living with a girlfriend, not wife. LMAO. Get a grip.", "YTA. No court would deny custody over something so inconsequential and ridiculous. If that\u2019s how your girlfriend feels comfortable sleeping, good for her. Leave her alone", "YTA. That\u2019s literally how she sleeps/relaxes. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s doing anything weird of sexual. You should be raising your kid (that you literally just found out about) that breasts are exclusively sexual organs and that they shouldn\u2019t bother people about how they like to sleep. Tell your ex to mind her own business and that others sleeping habits/comforts aren\u2019t her concern.", "You guys need to chill, or proof to me that you can chose your sleeping position while asleep. So unless I get a 8 hour video of you having your hands on your shoulders like a mummy while in deep sleep you leave your poor gf alone! The only compromise would be to nap in the sleeping room.\n\nBut YTA to both you and ex for being weird about an involuntary sleeping position and sexualizing things out of proportion", "Yeah get a load of the morality police OP here, he knocked a woman up and went about his merry way for 6 years and now he is the enforcer of propriety.", "Me too. Like a vampire / corpse.", "This stood out to me too. Wait until they're married and he can dump everything on her. \nWhy isn't he making it a priority to get his life under control and ready for a child *first* and then worry about progressing his relationship", "One of my cats is just fat enough that his stomach feels like a boob. I love to hold his belly and nap lol", "Your ex is sexualising your girlfriend's breasts and you're enabling it. YTA.", "You just found out about this kid and you think the way your gf sleeps is going to affect custody talks? Your ex is the AH and thinking that the way your gf sleeps is going to change that makes you one too.", "Vs", "Why did she hide a child from you for 6 years? Have you taken any steps to confirm paternity? Why is this something that even matters to her at all?", "YTA. But not harshly. \n\nThis sounds like it's a way she makes herself physically comfortable to sleep or relax. It's ridiculous to expect her to be uncomfortable. And asking her to do things to make your ex happy probably isn't a good relationship strategy. (I mean unless you want to sew jealousy or you're trying to play them off each other or you just want to be single and lack the courage to end it. In which case, well played!)\n\nPerhaps \"why don't you sleep differently?\" wasn't a good way to approach it. People don't really get to control how they sleep. Maybe calmly explain the dilemma: \"I am concerned that this habit could affect my ability to gain custody later\"  and request that she nap in her bedroom when your daughter is there. \n\nAlso since she's doing this while not asleep and you want her to stop it sounds like you'd better shell out some money for a wardrobe of well-designed, quality bras that were professionally fit for her. Because this habit when awake seems like it's related to a lack of support, possibly. A better bra might make her comfortable and stop this habit. But since you're the one with the issue, you're the one who should purchase at least the startup collection of what are sure to be spendy bras.", "I sleep holding my chest and my hubby sleeps holding his stuff too. I can go to sleep not holding my boobs but I always wake up holding them it just happens. Your ex needs to get over it your child will be fine. Soft yta", "YTA", "Yta. You know they hurt for a lot of people once they\u2019re out of the bra, right? Certain times of the month they hurt no matter what.", "YTA\n\nAt this point, you're a red flag, you're using your current gf to get rights to your kid with another person. Don't dare deny it, it's obvious. You're even making insane requests like asking her to change how she sleeps or not to take naps. You're so far out of line, you can't even see the line anymore.\n\nHere's what's happening: Ex is doing anything to make half custody impossible for you, finding every nitpick she can. She found one and is now using it to attack your relationship from the inside out by making you act like an asswipe to gf. And you're gobbling that shit like it's pudding. If this keeps going you will: lose your gf, lose any chance at half/half and possibly even damage the relationship to your kid. \n\nBecause, your gf would be well advised not to stay with you, you're clearly not giving shit about her.\nLosing her, you lose chances at being stable enough for 50/50 which means less kid time. You're freaking out and turning into a self-destructive... doofus. \n\nShe should leave you, OP.", "I mean, men often fall asleep cradling their junk, and no one seems to care. YTA, who cares if either of them sleeps like that?", "You've never held your cock in your sleep?\n\nYTA", "Thank you, same, its not even really \"holding\" them. It's just a pillow for boobs. They gotta rest too. \n\n(Also, falling for that trap placed by ex to torpedo his relationship with gf, makes him even more of an YTA, not a soft one. Like cmon, it's obvious.)", "No, this one is among the easily believable ones. This is exactly the type of shit that happens everyday to real people.", "They do?! Wth I never knew that \ud83e\udd23", "I have big boobs and tend to X my arms across my chest/hold my boobs, but I'd do this if I was small too. It has nothing to do with my boobs, I've just somehow lived all these years in a human body and still can't figure out what to do with my arms when I sleep. If I don't tuck them in they end up flung all over the place and completely numb and dead when I wake up from me rolling onto them wrong.", "Why did it take so long to find this response?\n\nYes, even though GF's sleep position is perfectly okay, OP's goal is to avoid conflict with the ex, and right or wrong, it bothers the ex. The easiest solution is to have the GF nap in the bedroom. Problem solved, end of discussion.", "Thiiissssss .\nShe hid the kid for 6 years and now wants the gf to sleep as per her visual comfort. \nI can understand that OP is feeling anxious about the custody but the ex needs to chill tf out.", "Open door policy is cool in offices, not much good for privacy when living with family.", "Easiest and best solution is for GF to leave him in the dust.", "Are we sure it\u2019s even OP\u2019s at this point, sounds like she had a baby daddy who\u2019s bailed and was like you know who I could sucker into a child!", "So you all go to the bathroom with the door wide open? Eww. That definitely sounds more harmful than your gf sleeping comfortably.", "OP has not offered any clarity on this thing. Maybe they got a paternity test or something, idk? I hope they did. If someone comes to me saying i have a six year old, i would want to be sure first before i get too involved/attached.", "Depends on the judge. There's some really shitty ones out there.", "My cat sleeps on my boobs!", "Men have chests/boobs too. Is it inherently sexual when they have their shirts off at the beach, for example?"]}
