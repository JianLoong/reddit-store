I've heard in detail about how soft his ex-gfs hair was, he tells me about drinking/smoking weed, and all his friends. He is the most loyal son I could ask for. His mother passed away 4 years ago, and he is very protective of me.\n\nMy daughter (14) and my son (16) are on a road trip. When my son would take a picture with us, he'd always put on his leather jacket. I pointed that out and he got embarrassed. Our daughter whispered to him, \"that is because Jared said he likes it,\" but he shushed her. I didn't think much of it, but later we were in the car and my son kept asking to see my phone. His had recently broke. I kept joking I wasn't going to give it to him, but he kept saying \"please\" and giving me a sad face. I handed it over and he absently said thanks, I need to text my boyfriend.  I said your bf? and he goes \"oh, no no, sorry, freudian slip, not bf, best friend, god\" but I could tell from his reaction that he was freaking out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis sister in the backseat immediately goes, \"welp, guess that is out.\" To say I was shocked would be an understatement. My son just doesn't seem gay at all, he's a masculine guy. I'm not a bigot, I was just surprised is all. I said, \"Are you gay? What is going on?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy daughter in the back said, \"Bi people exist, dad. I'm one too.\" Now I'm even more surprised, she's a child. My son says, \"Well, maybe she's right, unless you find me to be a disgusting freak, then no.\" I didn't even know what to say. I said he didn't seem gay at all. My daughter yells in the back and says people don't seem gay. I said, sure, I guess, I'm just surprised. He said I'm sorry for hiding this from you, I was just scared to say it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should have reassured him but instead I said I was disappointed, I thought he told me everything. He said I didn't want you to hate me, I'm sorry. I said, \"Well, who is this guy? Is he straight?\" He said dad I wouldn't crush on a straight guy, but he showed me a picture. The guy looks masculine too. He looks straight. It just struck me as an odd couple. I made a little fun of how long his hair was to relieve the tension. My daughter got onto me again, and I said look, I'm just not sure he's good enough for you. She said you are being so rude, you are old and mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started arguing that I wasn't being mean, but my son cut me off. He said seriously, both of you stop. Then he said \"we got you dad, sorry, it was a prank, none of it was real.\" I said no, it's okay, but he cut me off again and said really, its fine, just forget it all happened. It was very uncomfortable after that. I tried again, but he told me to drop it. I told him he could have my phone to text Jared, if he wants it. He was beaming when I gave him my phone and I wanted him to be happy again. But he said no, it's fine. I looked at my phone to see his text to Jared that said \"I miss you so much\" and I felt bad. I could have been more supportive, but I was surprised. AITA?

Made stupid comments,  tried to deflect with jokes.\nIn my head, my intentions were not bad. I just panicked.\n\nBut here is the thing my (and your) intentions DO NOT MATTER.   Your kids' perceptions and feelings do.   Your kids gave you clear signals and full on statements that you were going to far and being insulting and hurtful... and you kept going.    That is where YTA.\n\nSo now you can work to make it better.   Apologize but also let your actions speak for you.   Do not rely on your kids to educate you, but if they try- -shut up and  listen.

Don\u2019t you remember being 14. She\u2019s allowed to say she is Bi. Your only job in this realm is to protect them and be supportive. Make sure there are condoms in the house. Talk about STDs and how to get help if they need it. You can make this better.", "Yes, YTA, and I wish I was more surprised you even have to ask.\n\n>My son just doesn't seem gay at all, he's a masculine guy.\n\n>The guy looks masculine too. He looks straight.\n\nYour views of gay and bi people are stereotypical and homophobic. You seriously need to educate yourself before you find yourself in a situation where your kids rarely visit/speak to you, if at all.\n\n>Now I'm even more surprised, she's a child.\n\nShe's 14. You wouldn't be surprised if she was straight, so don't act like this is surprising or abnormal. She's a teenager and absolutely old enough to know who she likes.\n\n>I could have been more supportive, but I was surprised.\n\nRemove the second half of this sentence and stop making excuses for yourself, and maybe you'll have a chance at being a good, supportive parent.", "YTA.. I can see being initially surprised but, man, you took those scissors and kept running with 'em, didn't ya. Where exactly is this line, in your spectrum of masculinity, that determines a person's sexual preference? \n\nYou've obviously made homophobic remarks around your children in the past for both of them to be afraid to be open with you. You should really do some self-reflection!!", "Yeah. YTA. Hi! Bisexual here. There are plenty of masc gay and bi men. Your reaction wasn't as bad as I was anticipating but it's still. Not great. \n\nYou absolutely could have been more supportive. Being a kid figuring out your sexuality is really hard , it's scary to come out to parents as often they don't act very nice or supportive or ask inappropriate questions. With bisexuality specifically, there's a certain extra layer of shame to it because we are often not taken seriously. \n\nApologise to your son! Do some of your own research into LGBTQ youth and how to support them. PFLAG is a great option.", "YTA. Yes, you messed up, but you were taken by surprise, so you have a partial excuse. You still need to repair it. Also, you don't seem to know the difference between gay and bi. Do some research before you address it again.\n\nFurther, note that accusing your son of having a crush on a bf who was straight was an insult.\n\nFinally, you've just driven your son back into the closet. You do have a lot to fix.", "YTA. Even though your words seem ignorant rather than malicious, being an asshole out of ignorance is still being an asshole. \n\nIn the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Twenty-Three, it should really not be surprising that a 14-year-old is capable of having an orientation, or that a boy could be \"masculine\" or \"not look gay\" (whatever that means) and still be gay or bi. (Incidentally... did you know that the entire heavy metal aesthetic, which is generally considered a fairly \"masculine\" aesthetic, was copied directly from gay club culture because Rob Halford of Judas Priest is very gay? Just goes to show that concepts of \"masculinity\" are contradictory at best.)\n\nObviously part of the responsibility for ignorance lies in the person who fails to seek out education and doesn't allow themselves to learn, but of course part of the blame lies with the people and society who should have been teaching you these things too, because they failed you and they *definitely* failed your children. The fact that you have somehow managed to be so isolated from information about orientations when having children at that age is a huge failing of every structure that allows that situation to exist.\n\nBut you have a chance to turn this around. You can learn about LGBTQI+ issues and make it up to your kids by actively seeking education on the matters that are critically important to them. Because that information will not passively arrive to you, as you've now learned.", "You smacked yourself in the face with every verbal rake in the yard with this one. \n\nYour kids seem super chill and like great communicators. You\u2019re not in that loop because you\u2019re letting your son be protective towards you, which isn\u2019t a cool dynamic to encourage with your kid. It means information is being kept from you for your own good, and this was clearly information they were both keeping from you. You need some family recalibration. I\u2019m sure a large element of this is accepting that they\u2019re growing up, but every one of your responses seems to be along the lines of \u201cbut you\u2019re not *bi* bi, right?\u201d. Instead of trying to hash out any issues he had around his sexuality or use this as an opportunity to open up to you about it, he elected to drop it. Not because he doesn\u2019t seem to have a decent handle on the issue himself, but because he didn\u2019t want the bother of dealing with upsetting you. So that makes YTA. \n\nI think you could stand to take a beat and check in with how you really feel about this before you talk to yours kids about it again. Opening up a dialogue if it\u2019s just gonna be more of the same is gonna make things worse. Honestly, you could probably drop it and pretend the conversation never happened. Sounds like both of your children will accommodate you if you go this route, although you will continue to be left out of the loop until you\u2019re the one who\u2019s ready.", "Omg yeah YTA and you need to confront some deeply homophobic ideas you seem to carry", ">My son just doesn't seem gay at all, he's a masculine guy.  \n>  \n>The guy looks masculine too.

This was an unfair judgement on their character and I apologise for this. I've been in OP's son's position (being told \"I never would have thought you were gay\") and this pushed buttons for me. I apologise for allowing my feelings cloud my judgement. I do still stand by my YTA judgement and my interpretation of OP's comment, but I see that this cannot reasonably be described as bigotry. Thank you to the commenters who raised this.", "YTA. Just tell them you support them. You don't have to tell them you're disappointed, and sometimes kids at that age might just be experimenting or they might be fully serious and that's what they're into. Either way, you solidified why your son was scared to tell you.", "[removed]", "YTA, your kids are right, people don\u2019t \u201clook\u201d gay all the time. It reminds me of the awkward questions I got when I came out to certain people. You need to apologise.", "YTA, I\u2019ll make it short and sweet, gay or bi men don\u2019t have a \u201clook\u201d neither do lesbian or bi women. Instead of supporting you were questioning. As someone who went through this with their own mother as a trans pan/bi person questioning why they didn\u2019t look or act a certain way before being outted or coming out is damaging especially since many of us were forced to conform to a heteronormative society.", "Your actions made it seem like YTA.  Disappointment as a first reaction to someone coming out isn't exactly reassuring. Also, I think that your attempt to deflect was poorly-timed. You should have been supportive 100%, and only used humour when you were sure that your kid would take it the way it was intended.\n\nI think what you can do now is to talk to him and tell him in no uncertain terms that you're ok with whoever he dates, as long as that person is good for him. Good luck!", "YTA. \n\nI would guess that your son (and daughter) didn\u2019t come out to you before now because this is not the first time you\u2019ve said mildly offensive things about LGBT+ people. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re malicious, but you clearly have some backwards beliefs about what it means to be attracted to the same gender.\n\nOff the top of my head, this is where you fucked up:\n\n- Many gay or bi men are masculine. Your beliefs on what queer people are like seem to be based on stereotypes and generalizations. You made the mistake of making assumptions with your son and telling him he doesn\u2019t \u201cseem gay\u201d, and then you immediately did it *again* with his boyfriend. \n\n- You immediately went off about his boyfriend\u2019s looks, said they were an odd couple (because they don\u2019t fit your idea of what queer people look like), and said he\u2019s not good enough for your son (even though you haven\u2019t met him and know nothing about him other than he\u2019s a boy). If I were your son, I would be under the impression you didn\u2019t like me dating a boy but wouldn\u2019t outright say it.\n\n- Your daughter is 14, a very normal age to start getting crushes on people. If she told you she had a crush on a boy, would you tell her she\u2019s too young to know if she even likes boys? She seems to have figured out who she likes, and good on her for defending her brother too. \n\nYou need to do damage control ASAP. Start researching how to support LGBT+ kids. Apologize to your son for making assumptions, and for putting your foot in your mouth while trying to justify yourself. Maybe tell him you\u2019re a bit surprised because he\u2019s only ever talked about girls, but that it doesn\u2019t excuse the stuff you said about \u201cseeming straight.\u201d Tell him you\u2019re doing research to learn how to be better at supporting him. Tell him you love him, that you\u2019re happy he\u2019s found someone, and that you\u2019d like to meet him when your son is ready.", "Holy shit, you were taken by surprise by it all, that\u2019s all. And your an idiot, so you said some stupid stuff. Tell him that. And that whatever he wants or whoever he is you love and support him fully! I grew up with a gay kid my best friends brother, and another friend of mines cousin. This was back in the late 80s n early 90s and it was different back then. I mean we didn\u2019t care, they were just Richard and Terry to us (they weren\u2019t together just 2gay kids in the same circle of friends) But holy shit did their family\u2019s react differently! Richards family just ignored it, his dad pretended he didn\u2019t know. Mom refused to acknowledge it. And Terrys family flat ran him off for being an abomination. After they tried to pray the gay away and sent him to a conversion church camp (which he escaped from, and yes he had to escape!) they refused to let him come around accused him of trying to force his little brother into gayness or something. It was crazy. But yeah. To us they were just like everyone else. And that\u2019s all they wanna be. Just accepted for who they are. \n So just sit your son down n tell him you love him. No matter what.", "If your first reaction to queerness just because you were \"surprised\" by it is to not even tell your son that you don't think of him as a disgusting freak but instead to perpetuate stereotypes of how gay people look... absolutely YTA. \n\nYour son was practically begging you to tell him you don't think he's gross, and you glossed right over it and then put your head even deeper into your own ass because you buckled down and argued about it instead, telling him you're disappointed. Of course he freaked out and tried to play it off. You 100% made it seem in the conversation as though you think less of him for his orientation, and honestly your post reads like that too. \n\nApologize to your kids. Both of them. And tell them that you don't think they're gross. They need to hear it. \n\nAnd don't be surprised if they tell you even less now than they did before.", "I agree with others verdict and all but why are you letting your 16yo drink and smoke weed??? It may be cause their mother passed away but they need proper help with that wth", "YTA. At least you can stop fooling yourself he tells you everything. Kids tell you what they think you need to hear.\nBut most likely he knows you got the bigoted view that bi and gay people has to be a certain type. This is probably a defense-mechanism because you think you can identify them before they get \"to close\".\n\n He was afraid to tell you for a reason and that reason probably is that you probably come across as anti-gay.", "YTA\n\nYou came off judgmental because you were being judgmental. Lots of masc men are gay, lots of femme women are lesbian, all kinds of people are all kinds of ways. \n\nJust apologize for your reaction and wait for him to forgive you.

If your kids are this open with you, it tells me that that you have a good relationship with both of them.\n\nJust follow up with your Son and Daughter privately and tell them that you we're surprised but not unhappy. Show them support individually so they know that you're there for them.", "I'm not sure you're an asshole as much as you just really, massively sucked at how you handled responding. Clearly (maybe not to your kids) not intentional but that response really sucked, even if you're surprised.", "I'm sorry to say but YTA Op.", "Yeah, you screwed this up pretty badly.  You are carrying around a TON of stereotypes about queer people, which is probably why your son (and daughter) never felt comfortable talking to you about this before.  You need to do some soul-searching here and try to address this because this is the kind of reaction that is really, really hard to take back.\n\nFirst off, you're missing that your daughter just came out too.  If you daughter told you she was straight at 14, you wouldn't bat an eye.  We never make straight people prove their straight credentials when they tell you they identify as straight.  Other orientations are no different.  Did you know you liked girls at 14?  I'm betting you did.  Your daughter knows she likes girls and guys at 14.  She just told you so and you just let it fly over your head.\n\nSecond, you need to realize that your son doesn't trust you with everything... he didn't trust you with this.  And what exactly does a 'gay man' look like in your head?  Bi and gay people are just people.  There are plenty of very masculine gay and bi men out there.  You can't tell by looking.  I can tell you've got a very, VERY stereotyped image of what gay people look like in your head and are defaulting anyone who doesn't fit this as straight by default- except the only way we can know another person's orientation is if they tell us.  You can't tell by looking.  The fact that you think that you can is probably part of why this discussion with your kids didn't happen earlier.\n\nI want to say you need to sit down and talk to each of your kids (separately), apologize, and then listen and learn.  It's going to be really hard to take back that initial \"I'm disappointed\" reaction so be prepared to work hard to earn that trust back.  I would even suggest family counseling or something of that nature to help you have this conversation in a mediated space with someone helping you to communicate.  \n\nYTA for your reaction.  Please get to work fixing this.  The number one predictor of LGBTQ+ kids doing well in life is parental support and acceptance.", "YTA, you did blow it. Maybe if you show your son you're learning about stuff an apology will alleviate stuff. Honestly sounds like your daughter is the one who you should be ask for advice.", "Your kids were testing you, they were checking the ground and if it was safe for them to come out. It was totally planned. I get that you were taken aback. But this \"doesnt' seem gay, seems masculine\"etc are not helping. I mean, what do you expect, dresses and makeup? Make sure you apologise for any weird remarks and be supportive of your kids. Soft YTA", "YTA. And homophobic and biphobic.\nMasculine men can be gay. Gay men don't \"look\" gay.\nPeople, including teens, can be sexually and romantically attracted to both sexes/more than one gender. \n\nAnd when your son comes out your primary concern should be how can I let him know I'm ok with this and support and love who he is?", "I think its a bit of a mixed bag but I feel like your heart is in the right place. I think the worst part is saying you're disappointed because he didn't tell you, but coming out of the closet can be one of the hardest things. There are so many gays out here that had great relationships with their parents, until they came out, or get outed, and next thing they know they're kicked out of their house and living on the street. Also, a lot of gay men are extremely masculine, but also,  a lot of gay men pretend to be extremely masculine when they're in the closet because they are literally hiding who they are. So, instead of being disappointed, try to be understanding, and let him know you love him regardless, and let him be whoever he wants to be, and don't repeat the same cycle of shock if suddenly, your masculine son, starts behaving a bit more camp.", "NTA. It was sprung on you whilst driving, without much time to think and the fact that you feel bad about it now, shows that you are not a bad guy or a homophobic parent. You seem to have a dated and stereotypical view of gay people, but that seems to be just from a place of naivete or ignorance rather than any deep ingrained predjudice. \n\nYour heart is in the right place imo. Maybe try a do-over in a more suitable setting.", "You messed up, but NAH.\nFirst, your daughter is right, people don't 'look gay'. You would be surprised by the amount of people who are gay or bi in your life and you just don't know. Please try to take that kind of comments out of your mind because they are offensive, even when you don't say it maliciously. People struggle with their sexuality for long periods of time and the last thing they want to hear is \"you don't look like it\". \nI say that there's no AH here but you gotta apologize and try to get things right. \nHug your kids and tell them you love them no matter what, and they will always be loved by you.

They will always have things that they might not tell you, and this is healthy also.", "Don't hate on OP he didn't do anything wrong. He is not 20 or under as most of you. He is from a different generation with different values. He loves his children and supports them and that's what matters.\n\nOP just tell your son that, if you've sounded rude then sorry about that you were just surprised.You don't know much about LGBTQAI+ stuffs and that's okay. Most people don't know anything about autist too bcz not every 2nd or 3rd ppl is autist or lgbt etc, and it's totally fine.

Sure, saying someone doesn't look or seem gay is a bit mean and sure, sticking to gay when it seems like he is bi also seems odd, as if you can only like 1 side, but it seemed more like lack of knowledge here, you just have no clue about the topic. Now sure, it did come across quite badly and it was kind of sh\\*tty, but in the situation, you didn't know better and it seems you know that you could've been supportive instead, but you maybe didn't think of it in the moment, that doesn't seem too far fetched. What is most important now in my opinion, is that you at least apologize and talk to your son, tell him, you just didn't know how to react and tell him how sorry you are, I'm sure he can forgive you. You messed up, but I wouldn't count being ignorant as being an as\\*hole.\n\nEdit: Also, maybe read up a bit online about the LGBTQ+ community. There is no black and white there, you can be whoever you want and you can look however you want, there is no standard for anything.", "YTA because you're going off of stereotypes. Your daughter is a bigger AH. She needs to learn to shut up and not expose people. If I were your son, I would be furious with her.", "NTA you were caught off guard and surprised. You didn't stop the car and throw him out, you didn't beat him. You just ignorantly said he doesn't look gay, which I can see how that will offend some people because it is a thing where people think gay people need to look a certain way and some will view that as dehumanizing.

It is important to sit your kids down, tell them you love them no matter what and want to learn how to be better if they are willing to help teach you. The word 'help' is essential there, you have to make an effort outside of just around them, as that was an upsetting situation for them because they think that thats how you think.

You didn't reassure him that you don't hate him. You made him feel like him having this secret that he thought you'd react badly to was bad, that he shouldn't have privacy in his own head.

He said he still loved me, but it sounded an awful lot like \"despite the whole gay thing.\" My relationship with him broke at that moment and has never been fully repaired. \n\nThat's what you're in for now.

You also need to get online and do some research on LGBTQ people and how to be a supportive parent. If it's safe in your area, you should also offer to buy pride flags for your daughter. It's going to take a while to rebuild your son's trust, but the way you support your daughter now will prove to him that you have changed and are ready to be an accepting parent.

I've heard in detail about how soft his ex-gfs hair was, he tells me about drinking/smoking weed, and all his friends. He is the most loyal son I could ask for. His mother passed away 4 years ago, and he is very protective of me.\n\n  \nMy daughter (14) and my son (16) are on a road trip. When my son would take a picture with us, he'd always put on his leather jacket. I pointed that out and he got embarrassed. Our daughter whispered to him, \"that is because Jared said he likes it,\" but he shushed her. I didn't think much of it, but later we were in the car and my son kept asking to see my phone. His had recently broke. I kept joking I wasn't going to give it to him, but he kept saying \"please\" and giving me a sad face. I handed it over and he absently said thanks, I need to text my boyfriend.  I said your bf? and he goes \"oh, no no, sorry, freudian slip, not bf, best friend, god\" but I could tell from his reaction that he was freaking out.  \nHis sister in the backseat immediately goes, \"welp, guess that is out.\" To say I was shocked would be an understatement. My son just doesn't seem gay at all, he's a masculine guy. I'm not a bigot, I was just surprised is all. I said, \"Are you gay? What is going on?\"  \nMy daughter in the back said, \"Bi people exist, dad. I'm one too.\" Now I'm even more surprised, she's a child. My son says, \"Well, maybe she's right, unless you find me to be a disgusting freak, then no.\" I didn't even know what to say. I said he didn't seem gay at all. My daughter yells in the back and says people don't seem gay. I said, sure, I guess, I'm just surprised. He said I'm sorry for hiding this from you, I was just scared to say it.   \nI should have reassured him but instead I said I was disappointed, I thought he told me everything. He said I didn't want you to hate me, I'm sorry. I said, \"Well, who is this guy? Is he straight?\" He said dad I wouldn't crush on a straight guy, but he showed me a picture. The guy looks masculine too. He looks straight. It just struck me as an odd couple. I made a little fun of how long his hair was to relieve the tension. My daughter got onto me again, and I said look, I'm just not sure he's good enough for you. She said you are being so rude, you are old and mean.  \nI started arguing that I wasn't being mean, but my son cut me off. He said seriously, both of you stop. Then he said \"we got you dad, sorry, it was a prank, none of it was real.\" I said no, it's okay, but he cut me off again and said really, its fine, just forget it all happened. It was very uncomfortable after that. I tried again, but he told me to drop it. I told him he could have my phone to text Jared, if he wants it. He was beaming when I gave him my phone and I wanted him to be happy again. But he said no, it's fine. I looked at his phone to see his text to Jared that said \"I miss you so much\" and I felt bad. I could have been more supportive, but I was surprised. AITA? Did I mess up?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We look at the kids and plan out their lives for them from the day they are born.. sometimes down to grandkids names and where they will live. We know it won't go like that but it is had  not to. Then you get a curve ball and have to see reality through a different lens.", "YTA, OP. At first I thought you were just surprised. Then you continued to make assumptions about how gay people look like. He literally told you he has a boyfriend and you were like \" So is your boyfriend straight \". Of course he won't be straight if he's dating a man.", "Partially YTA only for assuming that all gay and bisexual men act like Richard Simmons.   I'm a bisexual man that has always dated bisexual men and most people assumed we were just best friends. \n\nI've also dated bisexual women that are normal down to earth women... not butch or pornified. In fact, I've only met or known a few gay men who act the way you assume or expect them to act.\n\nThe issue is that Hollywood and the media only amplify gay men that are walking homophobic tropes and sells the idea that bisexuals only want men and end up with them.  The fact that you aren't nasty about it is the main reason you are NTA for the most part.", "YTA but your daughter is marvelous.", "I hope this is trolling but people are obtuse so I\u2019m going to say this as if this is real. \n\nYTA. First of all, this is your SIXTEEN YEAR OLD child, not your friend. He lost his mom when he was TWELVE. And you are sitting there telling us he chats about drinking and smoking weed? He is not your friend. He is your CHILD. \n\nAlso, what is this line?? \u201cThe most loyal son\u201d??? What the heck??? \n\nAnd then your daughter can\u2019t be bi because she\u2019s a child?? You said that on here. Like\u2026what? Educate yourself. Your son is still a child too by the way. \n\nOnto the issue at hand- even after you got over the \u201cshock\u201d, you are still commenting about how \u201cmasculine\u201d they both seem.

You are a bigot.", "I would tell your son that regardless of whether he is gay or not, you realize you should have responded better. Tell him what you wish you would have said. Maybe he will trust you again in time, but you need to work on yourself.", "Yes, you messed up and yes, YTA. Your son is gay even if he doesn't 'look like it'. You've done both of your children a disservice and don't be surprised when they share very little with you going forward. And frankly you do sound a bit homophobic too.", "Who cares who they like or love. My god it's not like they admitted to being sexually attracted to animals or kids. It's to another human their age. Gay bi or straight...it doesn't matter. Kids may tell you everything but obvs not bc they knew how you are and knew you would feel like this. That's on you and sham for making them feel that way.", "Yeah, you\u2019re the bigggg asshole here buddy. They were testing the waters, and didn\u2019t expect you to be this way. \n\nIn my experience, as a bi person, the parents who seemed like they supported LGBTQ+ people until it was their child, are sometimes the most upsetting. Parents that are obviously homophobic are at least consistent, you know you need to hide that part of yourself. With parents like yourself, your child felt like they could trust you, and tell you this. \n\nHe is just figuring out his identity himself. Believe it or not, the first time you have a gay encounter there isn\u2019t a pamphlet drop or a jackpot prize that explains your orientation. It\u2019s just you and your feelings trying to figure it out. And that is much much more confusing for people like your son that \u201cseem\u201d straight like you describe. I\u2019m a woman, but that was also me, I am femme so people doubted my bisexuality. Especially my mom who I was very close to. It altered our relationship. We are still close, but I know I can\u2019t trust her to look out for my best interest when a same sex relationship is involved. Check your own biases before you harm your relationship with your son forever.", "Yeah YTA and you messed up, but it\u2019s salvageable. \n\nApologize to both your kids, express your unconditional love and support, and tell them truthfully and humbly that you made assumptions based on stereotypes you learned when you were younger and that you want to learn to do better. And look for some resources on parenting LGBT+ kids. Parental support is really important for their mental health. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if they said it\u2019s a joke. Tell them whether it\u2019s a joke or not that you realized you didn\u2019t react well.

You may see that if you become more accepting, he will be more comfortable to share that part of himself or not be so scared to appear less masculine sometimes. \n\nOr it may be that he's genuinely a really masculine guy, and that's fine too.

Those are not coming back, but you my friend, you just grew up with a stereotype. You'll be fine.", "... what do you think gay men look like, exactly? You really are bent on whether or not someone \"looks\" gay, eh?", "Let's try to list it all.\n\n- Immediately jumping to the conclusion that your son is gay, instead of putting 1+1 together and suggesting bisexual *or* gay. You have mentioned that he had a girlfriend, so that was also a scenario worth mentioning. It's a small thing compared to the rest, but as a father of at least one bisexual teen, you now have to be avare of the bisexual erasure [look it up], not add to it.\n\n- Assiming that a guy needs to \"look gay\" to be gay/bi.\n\n- Assiming that a 14 year old is too young to know that she is bisexual. Like, really, 14 year old aren't having crushes, stealing glances of pornography, experimenting? Or, do you consider the same gender feelings as somehow more \"dirty\", more adult-only than the heterosexual ones?\n\n- Being disappointed at your son not telling you \"everything\". Thats three different issues in one. 1. Your son has to be allowed some privacy around his life and thoughts. You shouldn't judge him as less loyal for not sharing everything that goes through his head, especially when those things include romantic and sexual situations between the minors. That's no longer healthy at this age. It's enough if he tells you about the risky, potentially dangerous stuff. The things he shares with you are a proof of the trust you earned, but, he is a teen, he will have some aspects of his life that he will keep to himself. You should learn to respect it.\n2. Be aware that discovering and accepting a sexual preferences is sometimes a process. You probably raised your son on the same false stereotypes that you present here. While the culture changes, he was still probably surrounded by the heteronormativity [look it up], homophobia, biphobia. It is quite a process to reconsile all this crap with the feelings you discover in yourself. A bit like now it's a process to reconsile your prejudices about the the bisexuality and homosexuality with everything else you know about your son, but trust me, it was even more scarry and harder for him. Then, there is a whole issue of coming out, judging the potential life-shattering consequences for both teens involved in all spheres of their lifes. Adding an awkwardness of the teen romance to this, it might took a while before anyone was even half-ready to come out to anyone.\n3. Your son was afraid to come out to you, because you are a literal museum of the prejudices. You might have caught up some good ideas too, but mixed with all the slips you make, you don't read as someone safe to come out to. That's on you. Fix yourself. Apologise. Keep apologizing.\n\n- \"Is he straight?\" I will let other comments to explain this one.\n\n- You were surprised, I guess that counts for something. But also, you really can make a bit of effort to learn about the lives and issues of the minorities that aren't your immediate family. Who knows what other prejudices you hold and spread unknowingly.\n\n- Your daughter came out too, and it just got lost in the chaos and awkwardness. You have even more fixing up to do with her.\n\n - replay that whole scene in your head. See how many times your kids were tending to your emotions, by reassuring you, telling to stol escalate something, backing off, and how maby times have you stopped to consifer their emotions, and helped them. Fron what you have written, the kids are way more into managing your emotions, than you are into caring about theirs. I hope that it's not your normal dynamic in the stressful situations.", "Gender presentation does not equal sexuality. It's not strange at all that two bisexual young men would read as very masculine. You fell into the trap of assuming a stereotype defines what is actually a large and varied group of humans.\n\nI suggest you have conversations in private with each of your kids and apologize for how you reacted. Explain that you're human like everyone else and just aren't as savvy about the subject as you now realize you should be.\n\nTell them you love them.

If your inner circle doesn't include it, you're going to see what the movies and TV show them as, which is stereotypical feminine.  I will say there's a show on Netflix about two boys in high-school and it's really well done. It's British so there's no angst, no sex, just a good show. It's called Heartstopper.

From personal experience: my relationship with my mother was a lot like yours and your son\u2019s when I was in high school.

She was so dismissive and cold (to the point where I went back into the closet for the next year and a half her reaction fucked with me so much) and while we\u2019re good now our relationship has never really been the same. \n\nWhat matters now is how you move forward. My mother never apologized for her initial reaction and subsequent treatment over the next five or so years. And she made her concerns *my* problem\u2014 what about grandchildren/I always imagined you with a man/etc. So don\u2019t do that shit lol. Apologize, reassure him you love him, and then don\u2019t push him. Let him open up to you in his own way and time. And if you do have any \u201cconcerns\u201d about his sexuality, talk to someone else about it, don\u2019t treat him like a sack of unfulfilled expectations. \n\nYou got this.", "A soft YTA cause I think you just got hit with a major case of foot in mouth out of shock. Just explain to them that you reacted out of shock and tried to use humour, and it didn't land. Assure them you're supportive of whatever sexuality they are, and that whatever partners they find you just want them to be treated well. Ask them if there's anything they want to explain or discuss about gender or sexuality. It sounds like your daughter in particular is quite vocal about it, so give her an ear and let her show you her insight.\n\nEdit: take care to come across like you genuinely want to learn, NOT like you're asking them to validate being queer. More of a \"what does being lgbt+ mean to you, and how would you like to see me support you?\"", "Holy cow I love/hate this. To be blunt, you seem to be coming from a place of ignorance.

He may not have come out to you for a long time but he wasn't trying to hide it very hard either, or he wouldn't be texting his bf with your phone. That means fundamentally he feels somewhat comfortable with you, imo.", "YTA. But you also can mend this, you can\u2019t change your initial reaction, but you can still sit them both down, tell them you love them and listen to them. And you can do your homework. \nI\u2019m gay and and I remember my parents initial reaction, but I also remember every relevant interaction since then (maybe not in detail, but in terms of support or non support).

I do think you owe your children an apology and a sit down with them explaining that it\u2019s okay im sorry I was flustered etc. etc. and talk about how you\u2019re going to go further and support them.

That is the point if the \"too young\". That is the point. Many parents are not comfortable with any semblance of romantic or sexual attraction because they do not view their children as becoming adults.\n\nThat is why they will go to great lengths to minimize or deny \"crushes\". That is why they will go to absurd lengths to deny young teenagers could be masturbating. That is why they fight against sex ed because the \"children aren't ready for it\".

Give the dude the benefit of the doubt and give him advice on how to take his kids aside and talk to them one on one before attacking him.

Young girls may be told that their feelings aren't \"real love,\" but no one denies that they have puppy love or crushes. It's why there's a term for \"puppy love.\" And telling girls that they're too young for boyfriends is a control thing, not a denial of their feelings. It's largely about fear of girls losing their virginity at a young age. It's different than telling a kid that her attraction to girls isn't real because she's too young to understand such things. That's homophobic, because a lot of people don't think that homosexual feelings are real, or they think they're inherently sexual, not a basic attraction. And therefore young kids can't know they're gay, because they don't have sexual feelings yet. When of ourse kids who are too young to understand sexual feelings can have crushes on either sex, but some homophobic people don't get that. And those homophobic people don't want to admit that young teens have sexual feelings at all.\n\nBTW, I'm very straight, but I have a teenage gay daughter who has been told by relatives and others that she's too young to declare that she's gay.
