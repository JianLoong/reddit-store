{"id": 27123, "submission_id": "16lwlcf", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to remove someone from our wedding?", "selftext": "So my husband and I are getting married this December. We\u2019ve recently been having discussions about one particular person that I don\u2019t want to be in the wedding. It\u2019s his best man\u2019s plus one. Let\u2019s call her Katy. \n\nSo prior to about a month ago his best man (Jake) was in a relationship with my made of honor (Lily). Jake is my husband\u2019s friend since high school, Lily is mine. We introduced them to each other shortly after me and him started dating and soon after Jake and lily started dating. \n\nA month ago Jake broke up with Lily and nobody really knew why until it became clear that he had been hooking up with another girl - Katy, behind Lily\u2019s back. Jake and Katy are now a couple and he wants to bring her to the wedding as his plus one. \n\nSo my husband and I got into a heated argument over it. He\u2019s saying it\u2019s none of our business who Jake brings as his date, everyone gets a plus one and it\u2019s not fair that we decline his plus one.\n\nMy thoughts are that it\u2019s bad enough that he did this to her (she\u2019s been crying like nonstop since she found out) and she has to come to the wedding and pretend like everything is fine but he wants to bring the girl that he cheated with and my friend has to look at them, see them kiss and dance and have fun while she sits there miserable. I said he gave up the privilege to bring a plus one when he decided to take a big dump on my friend\u2019s feelings. \n\nAm I overreacting here or am I right to not want this person to attend?", "created_utc": 1695046144, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lwlcf/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_remove_someone_from/", "score": 2158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's stupid. Time to look at whether your future husband thinks it's okay to cheat and be rewarded for doing so.\n\nNTA. It's reasonable to say \"Hey buddy, this is my wedding. We can't have your affair partner here. The whole point of this event is about marriage and committed relationships, and it's just not right to bring the woman you cheated on our MOH with.\" Plus, it's a new relationship. They haven't been together for a year, so there's no guarantee they'll be together in a year. Don't fuck up the photos.", "Why do you just object to Katy being there but not Jake? I'd be more concerned about your husband having a best friend who cheated and him being just fine with that. Is he okay with cheating in general? I wouldn't want someone standing next to me on a day that symbolizes union and love if they can't honor their own partner. Katy is probably just going to be the next woman he lets down/cheats on anyway. But if it were me, I wouldn't want either of them there. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - you\u2019ve known this new women for a hot second and she doesn\u2019t have an automatic right to attend at this point. If he\u2019s going to make Lily that uncomfortable, so quickly and can\u2019t see that as being an issue, he\u2019s the AH. It is hard enough she has to see him there and even interact with him, but this is too much. \n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t get that, suggest you delay the wedding indefinitely, he can be so indifferent to other people.\n\nAdd ages- \u201cdating since high school\u201d could have been last year and I\u2019d say, get over it but it sounds like the dates for 5+ years.", "NTA - If Jake cared at all about your husband, he wouldn't even be asking to bring a date to the wedding that is guaranteed to cause drama and hurt feelings. His cheating makes him a questionable choice of best man. But I think his total disregard for the impact bringing his new partner could have on your wedding day is worse. \n\n  \nPeople in the wedding party are there to SUPPORT the bride/groom, as opposed to guests who are just there to CELEBRATE the bride and groom. Obviously you still need to respect the people in your wedding party because you care about them and they are spending time and money to support you. But their role the day of the wedding is different than a guest's role. Honestly, I am always surprised when people in the wedding party want to bring a date that is a relatively new partner - especially one that is going to be high conflict. Why would you bring someone who doesn't know anyone? You are either going to be neglecting your partner or neglecting your duties as part of the wedding party. \n\n  \nI suggest that you talk to your fianc\u00e9 and see if he would be willing to compromise and tell Jake that he can either continue as the best man and not bring a date OR he can attend as a guest only and bring Katy.", "Most definitely NTA and there\u2019s really no explanation needed. \n\nNow with that being said, I love a good spicy, messy wedding so if this Katy does show up I would be honored to be invited as Lily\u2019s +1 just to cause some chaos and try to piss Katy off. I expect nothing in return from Lily and she doesn\u2019t even need to talk to me if she doesn\u2019t want to lol. Just let me work my magic and I\u2019ll have Katy pissed tf off by the end of the night and never wanting to speak to this Jake fella ever again. \n#JusticeForLily \ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffc", "NTA and I'd be looking sideways at my fiance for not replacing Jake as best man immediately.  Did your fiance know about the hookups with Katy? A best friend would know this and keep quiet \n\nYour fiance can offer that Jake attend alone or not attend at all.", "NTA\n\nIt says a lot about your fiance that he is condoning unfaithful behaviour.", "NTA.  Having your MOH miserable at your wedding is going to be distracting, and it\u2019s going to impact *your* enjoyment. If your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t care about Lilys feelings, he should care about yours.", "NTA. I am also not liking your husband for being spineless.\n\nBasically he is saying his priorities come before your concerns. 100% if Jake behaves badly in the future he will defend him.", "NTA - You may feel stuck having Jake there even though he's a cheating (insert here), but you don't have to torment your best friend with his cheating partner. I see your husband having two choices: 1) Jake comes stag or with someone acceptable (i.e. family member, friend), or 2) Jake bows out completely. I can't imaging having cheaters front and center at your wedding and I already can't see how your friend and MOH will feel standing across from Jake. That will be hard enough for her and I can't imaging someone shitting on her to boot. You're a good friend.  As an aside, you may want to find out from your future husband why he's okay with cheating.", "I think you\u2019re perfectly fine to say you didn\u2019t calculate jake bringing another date to the wedding.\nHe was partnered with Lily.\nNo extra guests. NTA", "NTA\n>He\u2019s saying it\u2019s none of our business who Jake brings as his date, everyone gets a plus one and it\u2019s not fair that we decline his plus one.\n\nHe *had* a plus one. He *cheated* on her. Therefore, he loses his plus one.", "NTA but your husband to be and his friend are giant ones", "NTA. If I were the husband I would have removed Jake from the best man list as soon as I had found out that he had cheated on my SOs best friend and had the audacity to invite the other woman (that you both known for little time) as a plus one. Cheating takes two people, not just the affair part.", "Nta. Normally, it would be an asshole thing to police just one person's plus 1. But normally, none of the guests have cheated on the maid of honor and are trying to bring the mistress to the wedding.", "NTA\n\nHonestly even Jake would be a no for me.  \n\nIf my husband wanted ***a cheater*** to stand with him while he gave his vows, I would know the vows mean nothing.  \n\nCheaters don't get to stay in the lives of people that have standards for themselves.   Don't keep people around that are fine with stabbing people in the back.  It's a lack of character.  If they're fine doing it to someone they're supposed to love, they'll just as easily toss friends under the bus.  \n\nAre you sure you want him in the wedding at all?  Are you sure your fiance is actually loyal and not cheating?   He's sure fighting pretty hard to help a cheater.", "NTA. It's not unusual for a +1 not to be extended for a very short term partner, regardless of funky circumstances, many people prefer to be only surrounded by people that they love and care about and vice versa at their wedding. If your guests (barring Katy) fit those criteria, there's no reason for her to attend.", "I just pictured this. You and your guy standing there, solemnly telling each other to be faithful till one of you dies while your husband is accompanied by a cheater and you by the betrayed, sobbing girlfriend. \n\nThats going to be great, what a day to remember :)\n\nJack doesn't even have to bring a plus one to make this a very special day for you and soon to be husband. But bringing his affair partner as a plus one will be the cherry on the top :)\n\nI would ask lily if she is fine with it (assuming you really want to get married like this) and to be really really honest and if not offer her to just be a guest or not come and whatever she decides will be extended to jake. So if she rather drops out as moh, jake will be dropped as best man too. If she is only a guest she can attend alone or get a date and jake can do the same (since as guests they can leave w/o it ruining the party). And yes, that would be my hill to die on, means if hubby doesn't agree, then there will maybe be a bride in the wedding (if kate has a sister) but it would be definitly not me.\n\nBc at the end of the day, marriage is about compromise, and if compromising is already not possible at the wedding itself, it will also not work in the marriage.", "NTA-  your fianc\u00e9 sees nothing wrong with cheating .\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 sees nothing wrong with being cruel to your best friend .\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 cares more about his cheating best friend\u2019s feelings than he does about yours on your big day.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is gonna expect you to be friends with the new girl .\n\n\nAre you sure you want to end up with this guy ?someone who doesn\u2019t think cheating is a big deal??\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if him and his bff whored around on the both of you .\n\nPlease think twice about this wedding OP.", "NTA-\n\n-It\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s wedding. Katy was literally just a side piece made girlfriend (maybe) and they\u2019ve only been \u201cdating\u201d maybe a month\u2026. Clearly it\u2019s not a serious relationship or anything\u2026 \n-My wife and I had to know the plus one before we gave one out and agree to the plus one", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Lily skipped it for mental health reasons.", "NTA\n\nYou can't have all three of those people at the wedding, and the other two are in the wedding party. Obviously the new girl cannot come.", "NTA. This sounds like top-tier drama that your wedding doesn't need. In this situation one or both of the former couple should offer to rescind their RSVP for the wedding to avoid either the groom or bride having to ask. The irony is, the job of reminding people of that level of courtesy falls on the best man/maid of honor so... I'm sorry, this situation stinks.", "NTA. This will be torture for Lily. It's a little concerning that your fianc\u00e9 is okay with all of this and has no issue with the fact that Katy coming will be real disrespectful to Lily.", "NTA ask him if it had been Lily who had cheated on Jake and then wanted to bring the guy as her plus one what he would want.\n\nJake just has to suck it up that he doesn't get a plus one.\n\nI would question your fianc\u00e9's view on cheating that he thinks it ok for the AP to be coming along after such a short amount of time and how disrespectful that is to Lily.\n\n He's going to expect you to be friends with her because it's his bsf's gf.", "NTA... Katy is not your friend, so not someone you want at your wedding.  I'd ask him to not bring her to the wedding as it may bring the wrong drama to the wedding.", "NTA\n\nYour husband needs to understand that this is yours and his wedding.  His best man should realize that bringing Katy to the wedding will cause discomfort and add drama to the wedding party/day thus taking the focus away from which the day was intended.\n\nIf your husband's friend was a good friend, he would realize this and not piss about it.  At the same time your maid of honor shouldn't be bringing a plus 1 either.  If they both are your friends they would be focused on making sure you day goes off without issues, not adding to it.", "NTA. OP, I'd be seriously concerned that your partner seems to be so okay with cheating. I'd tell him that. By letting this woman come, he's showing he's supporting the cheaters. Is that how he feels? Does he not have an issue with cheating?", "NTA - if Jake was truly a good friend to your husband he wouldn\u2019t be trying to cause drama at his wedding.", "NTA\n\nMajor bummer about this drama during what should be the happiest time for you. Wish you a happy event at the end of this tension!  \nYou're not in the wrong here. Your big day, your call. It's like... your party, right? If something's gonna throw off your vibe, it's cool to switch things up. Plus, the major tension that will **undoubtedly** be there, will make it awkward.\n\n You do not want to play a referee at your own wedding.", "NTA. A wedding is supposed to be a celebration of love and faithfulness. Why would your husband be okay with a cheater in your wedding?", "i'd be questioning my relationship with the fianc\u00e9 if i were you. NTA.", "NTA\n\nOh HELL NO.  It is your business who Jake brings as a plus one to your wedding.  Revoke his plus one and do not let Katy anywhere near your wedding.", "I would not go through with wedding unless he disinvites said friend", "Nta but your future husband is. Are you really ok with marrying someone who is willing to overlook such disgusting behavior from his friends? Not only overlook it but argue that it isn't yalls business so why does it matter? Morals matter and I'm very sincerely hopeful you aren't in this same position in the future since your soon to be spouse is pretty blase about immoral behavior.", "NTA.\n\nI say Jake can have a plus-one, but it can't be Katy. If he refuses, that's his problem.", "NTA. If Jake cared about you and your fianc\u00e9 he wouldn\u2019t want to make your wedding uncomfortable. Given the situation neither Jake or Lily should bring a guest.", "This whole thing sounds incredibly immature. If you extend a plus-one, there\u2019s no fair, respectful, or polite way to dictate who the acceptable plus-ones are. If that\u2019s not ok with you, don\u2019t extend plus-ones at all, and only invite named guests. Do you REALLY want to be in the business of policing your guests\u2019 sex lives? Even if you could, you\u2019d most likely end up learning a lot of things you didn\u2019t want to know.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need the drama at your wedding that him bringing Katy would bring. He can date who he wants, but he cannot rub his mistress in his exes\u2019 face at your wedding. That\u2019s not \u2018involving yourselves in his relationship\u2019, it\u2019s being a decent person and looking out for your friend.\n\nIt\u2019s the least Jake could do after the hurt he\u2019s caused. He\u2019s caused enough drama and heartache this close to your wedding. He can go without his mistress for one night, if he really cares about his best friend.", "NTA\n\nYou can invite and disinvite whoever you want at your wedding but you need to be prepared for the repercussions.  Is Jake likely to drop out of the wedding altogether if he can't bring Kate so your fianc\u00e9 has to find a new best man?  \n\nTo be honest I'd suggest kicking Jake out of the wedding anyway because I can see the whole day being awkward with both him and Lily, particularly the wedding photos.  I mean when people look at them are they going to be thinking how great you and your new husband look or the fact that the best man cheated on the bridesmaid?", "NTA it IS your business because its YOUR WEDDING. zero drama. dont let her come", "NTA,", "NTA- their drama will ruin your wedding", "NTA. But if he was dating Lily up until a month ago why did he have an invitation with a +1? Or was that an add after the break up? And why? If he asked to bring someone you just say sorry but the guest list is set and we can\u2019t add another person at this point. Did your husband do it behind your back?

OP\u2019s fiance is in between a rock and a hard place. OP\u2019s friend wasn\u2019t right to do things the way he did, but he found someone else and broke it off. He didn\u2019t get busted in an adulterous affair. OP\u2019s fiance doesn\u2019t have to keep only perfect friends who never fuck up. The commenters on these post seem like super lonely people. Wouldn\u2019t it also be a red flag for someone to ghost their lifelong best friend over this? Nah. That\u2019s wack. Let him bring his damn date. Find your friend a date. Let\u2019s stop turning weddings into an opportunity to settle scores.", "NTA. I\u2019d also say that for wedding you can give a plus one or you can invite their date by name if they\u2019ve been together and are a social unit. I\u2019d argue that at a few months, Jack and Katy are a new couple, not a social unit, and that you didn\u2019t anticipate adding more people to the guest list so this would mean that you\u2019d have to give out plus ones to other people to make it fair. I\u2019m planning my own wedding and just won\u2019t be inviting people who would bring me stress rather than joy tbh", "NTA, Yes you absolutely have a say in who get a plus one and who they bring.  It\u2019s your wedding!  The focus should be on you as a couple and not the drama of best man with his AP new girlfriend.  At my daughters wedding, a couple years ago, No plus ones were allowed unless they were 1) married or engaged or 2) friends with the bride and groom as well.  Only one single uncle got a plus one and he brought some escort chick in a VERY short hot pink dress that hardly contained her assets.  She was a drunk wreck in the dance floor.  Your Best Man does not need a plus one.  Nor does his girlfriend of a month, that you don\u2019t know, need to be at your wedding.  You CAN institute rules for your invites at any time.  It\u2019s is YOUR wedding, please remind your future husband of that.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, it's not a good look that your husband is not only still cool with his best friend despite knowing he's a cheater, but that he's also cool with him bringing his affair partner as his plus 1. Any reasonable person would find that inappropriate, it's concerning that your husband doesn't.\n\nSecondly, it's completely normal to not extend plus 1s to people who are not in a long-term or committed relationship. These 2 have only (officially) been a couple for a month. That doesn't qualify.\n\nStand your ground. Tell your husband that if he still wants to invite his friend, that's his call, but (a) he shouldn't expect you to have any interaction with him or pretend to like him, and (b) he does not get a plus 1. If that's a deal breaker, then he can stay at home.", "NTA...but a good friend. He can come without his plus one.", "NTA \n\nHe did have a plus one when you began planning your wedding. Your friend, he doesn't get a 2nd plus one just because he chose to sleep around.\n\nPlus, do you really want his new girlfriend in your photos when chances are he which cheat and ditch this one before too long.\n\nA fight on the dance floor if the former girlfriend and the new one clash under the influence of alcohol.\n\nHave someone standing at the alter with your future husband who doesn't know the meaning of being faithful to a partner.\n\nDo you want the new girlfriend to have the opportunity to catch your bouquet\n\nIf you do let the new girlfriend go to your wedding make sure your friend has someone as her plus one who will make sure she enjoys herself and keeps her distracted from the man who doesn't deserve her and his downgrade.\n\nRemember your wedding is about you and your partner and having those who care about witnessing your day and bridesmaids and groomsmen are there to help the happy couple during their day.\n\nIt isn't a day for groomsmen to flaunt their new girlfriend around, especially if it is only being done to upset the bridesmaid.", "NTA- Tell Jake straight out you don't want Katy to come. It's bringing drama to the wedding.

If someone invited me somewhere he was also invited to, I'd have to think long and hard about going despite the time passed. And if he was bringing his AP?

Your reasons are very, well, reasonable. \n\nNTA", "NTA and your fiance just presented a red flag when he said that Jake's cheating isn't your business. HELLO!

Katy and Jake should not be at the wedding. You've got a husband problem to deal with right now.", "I think it's very concerning your future husband doesn't see any problem with Jake's behavior or him bringing his mistress to the wedding, especially with him being so cruel to your best friend. It's already cruel Lilly would have to put up with Jake alone, but with his sidepiece? That's brutal, and I can't imagine anyone wanting to do that to another person.\n\nYou are not overreacting, but ask yourself seriously why the man you are marrying doesn't see a problem with Jake's cheating and his mistress.

If I was you I'd hang out with Lily instead of going to wed a man who's fine with his friend bringing his affair partner turned gf to the wedding.

You don't get to punish people for not loving the people you love anymore. Be creative with the seating chart, so they're not in each other's line of sight, have her walk before him, so she doesn't have to look at him, and make sure she has lots of opportunities to have a great time, preferably with a handsome, funny date who is also a great dancer. \n\nYTA but you have a good heart and good intentions.", "NTA.

We\u2019ve recently been having discussions about one particular person that I don\u2019t want to be in the wedding. It\u2019s his best man\u2019s plus one. Let\u2019s call her Katy. \n\nSo prior to about a month ago his best man (Jake) was in a relationship with my made of honor (Lily). Jake is my husband\u2019s friend since high school, Lily is mine. We introduced them to each other shortly after me and him started dating and soon after Jake and lily started dating. \n\nA month ago Jake broke up with Lily and nobody really knew why until it became clear that he had been hooking up with another girl - Katy, behind Lily\u2019s back. Jake and Katy are now a couple and he wants to bring her to the wedding as his plus one. \n\nSo my husband and I got into a heated argument over it. He\u2019s saying it\u2019s none of our business who Jake brings as his date, everyone gets a plus one and it\u2019s not fair that we decline his plus one.\n\nMy thoughts are that it\u2019s bad enough that he did this to her (she\u2019s been crying like nonstop since she found out) and she has to come to the wedding and pretend like everything is fine but he wants to bring the girl that he cheated with and my friend has to look at them, see them kiss and dance and have fun while she sits there miserable. I said he gave up the privilege to bring a plus one when he decided to take a big dump on my friend\u2019s feelings. \n\nAm I overreacting here or am I right to not want this person to attend?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The groom's vows aren't that serious because his best friend has cheated on someone? Are you aware that they are separate people?\n\nAnd she's not supposed to trust his friend like that, she's supposed to trust her husband like that.\n\nListen, one day, not maybe but for sure, you will fuck up in a serious way. Doesn't have to be cheating, there are plenty of very bad things. And I truly hope you will be shown no mercy, no chance at redemption, and no loyalty from the people who love you. Just like you wouldn't show any mercy to them. Maybe then you'll learn about nuances.", ">Unless someone makes strides to show they improved and regret their previous actions\n\nAnd how are they gonna do that if you drop them immediately?\n\nETA in this situation, I would cut Jake because he obviously has no remorse if he wants to bring his AP to the wedding.  Not seeing any improvement here, that is wild to think that is acceptable.  But in general, I believe in giving people a chance to redeem themselves.", "I'm not saying it's wrong.  I'm not even trying to fight or argue with you.   Not everyone is trying to fight.  \n\nI'm just saying that information wasn't provided.", "hahahaa!! \"You're a weirdo!\" ... \"That's the loveliest thing anyone's ever said to me! *sniffle*\" \n\nLOL", "But we don't know she is a cheater! The cheater was Jake! Why do we always put the most hate and blame on the woman the man cheated with instead of the one who cheated?! \n\nIt makes no sense to me", "Again, getting this angry over a fictitious story on the internet is weird.", "I moved on and don't have time to read this novel"]}
