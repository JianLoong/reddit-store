That was fine with me since she was working minimum wage before they were born so we ended up saving more money. I currently work 8 to 6 but when I get home I usually bathe the children and feed them dinner while my wife finishes the cooking and cleans up.

Every Saturday she goes to her sister's or invites her over. She usually just gives me a heads up and asks me if I'm fine watching the kids by myself for several hours while she does her thing. I don't do much outside the house anyway plus I like to take care of my kids so I always oblige.\n\nAnyway, a few months ago I made a a new friend at work and he introduced me to Rocket League. I'm having so much fun playing it. We usually play when on Saturday nights for a couple of hours when the kids are asleep so it's no issue with watching the kids but recently he asked if we can play on Sunday mornings because he wants to go to bed early on Saturday to work out early on Sundays.\n\nI told my wife if she can watch our children on Sunday mornings for a couple of hours while I play. She did it a few times but then stopped. My kids kept coming into the room when I was playing and I was getting distracted. I called for my wife to take them but she was just goofing around on her phone. When I confronted her she said I can't expect the children to not want to spend time with me. I told her I need time for myself. She said video games is a childish hobby anyway and I need to find better use for my time.

So, you\u2019re both benefiting from her staying home. \n\nYou\u2019re the sole provider and help with the kids when at home. That\u2019s more than many men here can say they do. Some limit themselves to the provider role only. \n\nI think you\u2019re more than allowed to explore hobbies and take time off, but I think the part that unfortunately makes you the AH is to have allowed your friend to change the routine, because it was convenient for HIM, prompting you to give the ultimatum because your kids interrupt. \n\nYou\u2019re both allowed time for yourselves to relax and enjoy. It\u2019s just the way you went about it that makes your point seem unfair to her eyes. \n\nAnd yes, even if you deserve your time to unwind, try making your kids understand daddy\u2019s home but can\u2019t play with you because he\u2019s playing with his friend?!. They probably miss you more than you realise, and having you taken away from them every Sunday morning might be a tad sad for them.

It should be possible to play your game a couple of hours without disturbances. The ultimatum was a stupid idea", "Your choice of language when asking her to give you a couple hours for yourself sucks. But other than that NTA. Everyone needs just a little bit of time for themselves- stress relief is important. She spends time with her sister you play a game.  You guys need to talk and come to an agreement.", "NTA. Your wife has unilaterally decided that she doesn't want any outside help watching the kids. You don't seem to agree with that somewhat insane decision, but you agreed to let her try, supporting her financially while she attempts this madness.\n\nYou have only so much kid watching in you and want time to yourself which is 100% natural. She also only has so much kid watching in her and she also wants some time to herself. Again, totally acceptable. But she is stuck on this notion that you don't need any help despite the strain this is causing on your relationship.\n\nSo she needs to experience the full ramifications of her family mandates in order to make a proper informed decision. Either she can handle this with the amount of help you are able to give or she can't.

It\u2019s ok for your wife to have free time but she is not letting you.

I bet all the a h verdicts come from people with no kids, yeah, parenting is a 24/7 job but your not leaving your children unsupervised, you're asking your wife to compromise for a couple of hours, not a crazy request. Talk to her again, she may think your hobby is \"childish\" (which is totally uncalled for) but that does not change the fact is something you want to do and it's totally ok to want it, just like seeing her sister is cool. What would she say if it was something like \"can you watch the children while I read? Or while I see the f1?\" if the answer is the same then you have a greater problem on your hands, if she would be OK with that then is just that she does not understand your hobby, make her understand that is just something you enjoy.

It's better for you to either get headphones and and lock yourself in a room so the kids can't bother you, or go out to play.", "So, ultimatums are terrible. The point of an ultimatum isn't to have a conversation with someone. It's to force them to do something that you think it's obvious they should do, and they need to be cornered/forced/berated.

Just because your kid is at daycare or with grandparents for a few hours a few times a week doesn\u2019t mean someone else is taking on that mental load of being a full time parent, so it isn\u2019t correct to suggest that only SAHPs have to deal with the 24/7 mental load.         \n        \n*HOWEVER* - the vast majority of the time if one parent works full time plus outside the home and the other is a SAHP, naturally the ins and outs of parenting (who buys clothes, who coordinates appointments, who coordinates play dates) does tend to fall on that SAHP in the entirety. Because they\u2019re the one who is there to physically do that shit. Personally my husband and I are pretty split with that stuff (I work part time, but he works from home half the time and his job is a bit more flexible/less intensive than mine, plus I have ADHD so find managing calendars and such more difficult, so it naturally falls as a fairly even split).

I feel terrible for some of my colleagues/friends who work part time (or don\u2019t work) and clearly do *all* the parenting/domestic work and coordination \u2018because that\u2019s mum stuff\u2019 - they\u2019re constantly having to carry the entirety of the child\u2019s every need in their head rather than knowing they can rely on someone else to share that.      \n            \nIn conclusion:    \nYeah OP I\u2019m afraid YTA in this specific situation - as another toddler parent who does some days like childcare/works, I know how precious those few hours of weekend daytime \u2018labor split\u2019 (where you aren\u2019t totally and solely tied to keeping them alive every split second) are. You can\u2019t just take that away as if it\u2019s nothing. You need to find a post bed time gaming session time that works for your buddy, and/or only do the Sunday gaming on occasion, and/or find another game buddy. Because also your wife is right - the kids don\u2019t spend that much time with you (8-6 plus commute will be vast majority of their waking hours), and if you\u2019re then spending some of their waking play time ignoring them in the other room, that could damage your relationships with them.               \n              \nBut yeah this is why the idea of one working/one SAHP as a happy historical ideal is some rose tinted bullshit. Also it comes with pathetic sounding \u2018kids growing up in daycare\u2026\u2019 guilt trips, when actually the 3yo and 5yo in this case really *should* already be in daycare at least part time - outcomes for kids 2+ who are part time in daycare are actually better than those with SAHP.

Many people think OP is NTA. You are just biased af.", "Wait wait wait my dude, why can't she like watch the kids as they agreed?\n\nIs the reverse also true? If she's with her sister and the kids start coming up to her can he just answer \"well you can't expect them to not miss their mother\"?\n\nBecause again there was an agreement and now she doesn't do it because she doesn't think it's important", "Dude's NTA and 'everyone's' saying it", "When I'm not at work, I'm with my kids.

That's hours of parenting every day he's contributing and then solo parenting on weekends to give her time out of the house to socialize. \n\nThe only time he leaves the house is to work and when he's home he's being a dad.

I'm glad that you could sort the issue out with your fianc\u00e9 \ud83d\ude0a", "But the context changes it a bit in my opinion, because OP is just as entitled to his own alone time as his wife. Yes he could have communicated it better, but the point is, his wife did say that she will watch the kids and she didn't, because in the end, they started bothering OP.\n\nWhen OP is watching the kids and the wife has her sister over, should OP also let the kids bother them because chatting with family isn't even a hobby? I don't think so. So telling his wife that \"hey if you agree to watch the kids then please do so, so that I can play in peace. No problem if you can't do that because the kids want to come into the room all the time, but then I'll leave to make sure that I can get my alone time too.\" \n\nI *would* call this a boundary given the context that they seem to distribute workload evenly, and that his wife gets a few hours to herself every week too.

Which when you start to think about it is rather mean. Small kids don't see the world the way we do They take that kind of stuff personally.", "I agree that if he were just locking the door putting headphones on and not acting like she should have to give him \"quiet time\" it would not be as unreasonable as it is. \n\nIt's not bad to ask for video game time My husband does it all the time at a pretty intense level (10-20 hours a week depending on weather and not counting after they are in bed) he just doesn't care if one of the kids comes and sits in his lap while he does it. And if he wants actual space for it he just closes the door and doesn't get upset when they knock at it.", "Not true. When you look at the ages of the kids keeping them all on the same task is more than challenging for 15 minutes let alone a \"couple of hours\". \n\nImagine you have three cats and you have a cat wand and you're playing with it and they're all interested for about the first 5 minutes, which is optimistic, how long before only one cat is playing with the cat wand?

Could you convince a cat that wants to be in the room with somebody to stop meowing at the door?

It's no different than what she asks him to do for her.", "So you're excusing her. Gotcha", "I'm just thinking of that British expert who's kids crashed his interview and his wife runs into grab the first one and then the second one comes in with his little walker and chaos ensues!

Keeping 3 little ones away from you is not going to be easy.", "That changes literally nothing, though. \n\nWife still mostly leaves the house on Saturdays.

But OP states right there in the post that wife is too busy on her phone to watch and entertain the kids when he's trying to have his free time. It wouldn't be much to put the phone down and find a way to entertain kids. Soap dish bubbles! Coloring time! Building blocks! Fuck, even an episode of sesame street would do it if they like that sorta thing. \n\nShe's taking zero effort to give him the same free time that he so readily gives to her.

I'm not trying to compete but you're making it a competition between who deserves a break more than the other.\n\nShe was the one who decided to be a SAHM. I didn't ask nor did I impose this on her.

And cleaning up natural bodily functions aren't too bad once you get used to them, grow up. Day in and day out of stressful, tiring work can get to you after some time though.
