So, you\u2019re both benefiting from her staying home. \n\nYou\u2019re the sole provider and help with the kids when at home. That\u2019s more than many men here can say they do. Some limit themselves to the provider role only. \n\nI think you\u2019re more than allowed to explore hobbies and take time off, but I think the part that unfortunately makes you the AH is to have allowed your friend to change the routine, because it was convenient for HIM, prompting you to give the ultimatum because your kids interrupt. \n\nYou\u2019re both allowed time for yourselves to relax and enjoy. It\u2019s just the way you went about it that makes your point seem unfair to her eyes. \n\nAnd yes, even if you deserve your time to unwind, try making your kids understand daddy\u2019s home but can\u2019t play with you because he\u2019s playing with his friend?!. They probably miss you more than you realise, and having you taken away from them every Sunday morning might be a tad sad for them.

It should be possible to play your game a couple of hours without disturbances. The ultimatum was a stupid idea", "Your choice of language when asking her to give you a couple hours for yourself sucks. But other than that NTA. Everyone needs just a little bit of time for themselves- stress relief is important. She spends time with her sister you play a game.  You guys need to talk and come to an agreement.", "NTA. Your wife has unilaterally decided that she doesn't want any outside help watching the kids. You don't seem to agree with that somewhat insane decision, but you agreed to let her try, supporting her financially while she attempts this madness.\n\nYou have only so much kid watching in you and want time to yourself which is 100% natural. She also only has so much kid watching in her and she also wants some time to herself. Again, totally acceptable. But she is stuck on this notion that you don't need any help despite the strain this is causing on your relationship.\n\nSo she needs to experience the full ramifications of her family mandates in order to make a proper informed decision. Either she can handle this with the amount of help you are able to give or she can't.

It\u2019s ok for your wife to have free time but she is not letting you.

I bet all the a h verdicts come from people with no kids, yeah, parenting is a 24/7 job but your not leaving your children unsupervised, you're asking your wife to compromise for a couple of hours, not a crazy request. Talk to her again, she may think your hobby is \"childish\" (which is totally uncalled for) but that does not change the fact is something you want to do and it's totally ok to want it, just like seeing her sister is cool. What would she say if it was something like \"can you watch the children while I read? Or while I see the f1?\" if the answer is the same then you have a greater problem on your hands, if she would be OK with that then is just that she does not understand your hobby, make her understand that is just something you enjoy. Don't lose your temper again, though.", "NTA. Tell her hanging out with her sister is a giant waste of time and she needs to find something more productive to do since you won't be watching the kids on Saturday anymore.

People on here just love to hate on men.", "Nah. It sounds like you both need breaks from the kids. It's better for you to either get headphones and and lock yourself in a room so the kids can't bother you, or go out to play.", "So, ultimatums are terrible. The point of an ultimatum isn't to have a conversation with someone. It's to force them to do something that you think it's obvious they should do, and they need to be cornered/forced/berated.

Personally my husband and I are pretty split with that stuff (I work part time, but he works from home half the time and his job is a bit more flexible/less intensive than mine, plus I have ADHD so find managing calendars and such more difficult, so it naturally falls as a fairly even split). Actually it makes a big difference to share that load. I feel terrible for some of my colleagues/friends who work part time (or don\u2019t work) and clearly do *all* the parenting/domestic work and coordination \u2018because that\u2019s mum stuff\u2019 - they\u2019re constantly having to carry the entirety of the child\u2019s every need in their head rather than knowing they can rely on someone else to share that.      \n            \nIn conclusion:    \nYeah OP I\u2019m afraid YTA in this specific situation - as another toddler parent who does some days like childcare/works, I know how precious those few hours of weekend daytime \u2018labor split\u2019 (where you aren\u2019t totally and solely tied to keeping them alive every split second) are. You can\u2019t just take that away as if it\u2019s nothing. You need to find a post bed time gaming session time that works for your buddy, and/or only do the Sunday gaming on occasion, and/or find another game buddy. Because also your wife is right - the kids don\u2019t spend that much time with you (8-6 plus commute will be vast majority of their waking hours), and if you\u2019re then spending some of their waking play time ignoring them in the other room, that could damage your relationships with them.               \n              \nBut yeah this is why the idea of one working/one SAHP as a happy historical ideal is some rose tinted bullshit. Also it comes with pathetic sounding \u2018kids growing up in daycare\u2026\u2019 guilt trips, when actually the 3yo and 5yo in this case really *should* already be in daycare at least part time - outcomes for kids 2+ who are part time in daycare are actually better than those with SAHP.

If he took up chainsaw wood carving she'd watch the kids! lol", "He doesn\u2019t \u201ctake over for her.\u201d Seeing it that way is a problem. He wakes up with the responsibility to take care of his kids. His wife coordinates with him when she leaves or has sister over. This leaves him free to do what he wants while caring for his kids (which was his responsibility when he woke up).\n\nHis wife was fine with him taking Saturday nights to himself, so she\u2019s not begrudging him free time. \n\nIt\u2019s important to note that he is not reporting time accurately. He says a couple of hours, but he was up so late his friend couldn\u2019t wake up to work out. Gamers don\u2019t stop at 2 hours. OP probably slept in too and wife was fine with it.\n\nWhat he wants to do now is be completely absent during a prime kid time. He wants his wife to leave her home and take the kids on an outing or keep them away from him (something that is very, very hard to do and will involve lots of yelling, crying, and chasing after them). This demands a high level of energy from her and cuts the very limited amount of time his kids have with him. \n\nHe\u2019s trying to go tit-for-tat with his wife  but ignoring the fact that his 3 young children need time with him. They get lots of time with their mom, so her seeing her sister doesn\u2019t take anything away from them. They have limited time with their dad so him choosing to change his free time from when they are asleep to when they wake up takes from them. \n\nI support him having personal time, but gaming at this time does not work for anyone but his brand new friend. He can choose a different activity, a different time, or a different gaming partner, but making 4 people miserable isn\u2019t ok. There are other better options. But also, choosing to have 3 young kids means you don\u2019t get to pursue time-consuming hobbies for a few years. It\u2019s his kids\u2019 turn to have a childhood.", "A lot of times this is based on a judgement that \"video games\" is not an important hobby. If he wanted time to do something she approved of it might be a different story", "With her attitude I'm wondering how often it's sister coming over and it's both of *them* dealing with the kids any way", "Yes I read it the same way. And such things suck. I used to be an avid gamer and come from a generation where gaming was still ridiculed a lot and met with suspicion. But if you go to a chess club you're all so sophisticated. As if that is so much different. You sit around and play. \n\nSo I totally get why OP is upset if someone calls his gaming childish. I mean from a different perspective a lot of games are childish. 11 grown men running after one ball trying to kick it... If thats not childish I don't know. Grown men crying like babies when their team loses? Childish? It's a billion Dollar business and it's accepted as part of culture in a lot of places. \n\nOPs wife is incredibly selfish arrogant and ignorant of her husbands needs. OP works hard to not only provide for his family but also carries his weight with chores and kids when he's not working. So he too deserves some time for himself. Just like his wife who gets off every f!cking Saturday!", "Not even all of Sunday, just a few hours. He never forced his wife to be a SAHM either. It was her choice.", "OP says the three children are \"toddlers\". It's unlikely the SAHP has oodles of down-time throughout the day.", "When your co parent is reasonable sure. When they aren't tho sometimes you gotta lay down a boundary", "In this specific instance, hes asking her to give him a couple hour break from parenting.  She's refusing to do it because she wants to police what his hobbies are, so she won't give him a break when he's in the house. So, he leaves the house, just like she does on Saturdays.  \n\nIf your partner is being unfair and unreasonable, you dont have to comply.", "You phrase it as if he's asking her to be able to do something with her stuff, when he's talking about what he does with his own body/time.", "It's more like \" Watch the kids one day a week from X to Y, or I'll do it like you do it and just leave for a few hours\"", "Then every boundary is an ultimatum.", "It\u2019s not an ultimatum, because he\u2019s not trying to control her behavior.  He needs private time for his gaming. He has no choice but to leave the house.", "Not really, that just sounds like a reactive response to it.\n\nSometimes people say no. It's not always some kind of punishment.", "Yeah tell the friend to work out some other time.", "She is spending time with her sister EVERY Saturday.", "Yeah I don't really understand why he doesn't do exactly this. He barely spends time with them, he just feeds them and puts them in bed.\n\nHe has from their bedtime until he goes to bed to do whatever.\n\nOn the weekends they have quality family time and he wants to ignore them in the middle of the day? Can't he stay up late as he wants? Crappy parenting and idc if ppl downvote me for saying so. He just on a whim rescheduled his gaming time.\n\nSure, lock your kids and wife out but don't get surprised when they resent you for it.", "I totally agree with you. My husband plays Rocket League. But he lets our kids watch and help him design the car. Then they cheer him on. The matches aren't even that long. I'm all for alone time, but you're a parent first.

Your kids need to spend time with you when you're all home together.", "> Honestly while they\u2019re this young, tell your friend Saturday nights work best for your family and if you play on Sunday, guess what\u2014it\u2019s going to be a blended experience bro and you\u2019re going to have to parent through it like a SAHM does.\n\nThis. He changed the time for a ridiculous request from his friend. There isn't a person I know with kids who get alone time to do hobbies unless they're having family watch them.\n\nHis wife lives it everyday it's pretty ridiculous he expects her to do it on Sundays too.", "You mean the time I'm 100% willing to bet she and her sister get constant pestering from the kids during so she knows exactly what she's talking about about?", "I bet her visits with her sister aren't all *that* uninterrupted.", "He enjoys spending time with them. It's one day per week. Him doing this is turning her week into a 6 day work week and it's not just for a week or two, he wants to continue this indefinitely and now he's bitching and calling out that 'she agreed.' \n\nWhat about during the week; does he ever take all 3 of the kids someplace after work so his wife can sit home and not do shit? I'm guessing no. Is he offering something like this as sort of a compromise? He clearly isn't. \n\nIf you want to sit home and play videogames all Sunday morning without any distractions, that's fine. You choose how you spend your time. You don't have 3 kids and expect to be able to do that. It isn't even the video game day that's causing the issue, it's the distraction that he's complaining about. Of course he's distracted they're kids, that's what they do and there are 3 of them.\n\nNow he declares that he's willing to leave for the day which would mean that he only sees his kids one day out of the week. It's not even as if the youngest is 7 or 8; he might be able to get away with that and not be tah but the baby is 1. Didn't he say? He's willing to leave so that he only sees his 1 year old evenings and 1 day per week. \n\nDo you know what a 1 year old is? OP does, this is the third that he's had. They grow so fast at that age and you don't get the time back. A 7 year old or an 8 year old will be 10 in a few years and that's pretty much the same thing. A 1 year old will be 3 or 4 and that's totally different than a 1 year old. \n\nYou don't get to sing to them the same. You don't get to hold them like they're a baby and then one day they're sitting on your lap for the last time. Then that's it. It's over and you don't get to do it ever again. \n\nHe's trading this for a video game and it's still a baby. I have a 12 year old and I played videogames when he was incredibly young. He sat on my lap and it was distracting as hell; sometimes he'd mash on the keys. 'Oh; I think you just gave up our position and now, oh yeah they see me now. They saw that and how could they not. Umm, could you move your hand so I can try to fix this. Oop, nevermind. It's over, were going to be out of this one real soon. Yeah, well; sorry everyone.'\n\nHe's only 12 and I have a lot of time to spend with him yet, but it's not like that anymore. One day we did that for the last time and now it's over. He would ask me if I; 'wanted to play you tank game.' I had him convinced that he was helping me by driving as I tried to shoot. He doesn't do that anymore and he never will again. \n\nI don't even play world of tanks anymore. I spent some money on it and the account is gone. It's been gone for years. I could give a shit less and I'm sure glad that I never locked him out of a room or left the house for it. I never even considered it. I could not imagine myself doing that.\n\nThis guy is a huge ah.", "I mean, OP's wife *does* get time to herself; they've established she has several hours every Saturday. OP does *not* get any time to himself - it's all work or kids, and his wife refuses to extend the same courtesy to him that he does to her. I get the impression that the wife is coming at this with a \"my time is mine, and your time is also mine\" type of mindset.", "Do you have children? I mean i have one but that\u2019s enough to understand that having \u201cme\u201d time isn\u2019t always possible. There is little to no time to yourself with 3 toddlers. You can try to make plans for you but if thats not how the day goes you need to pivot and move on", "This is a weird take. Nowhere in this does it say he's spends no time with his children. In fact he takes over childcare on most days after work and spends time with them in the week. Then, he spends the entirety of Saturday with them to give his wife a break. Where the fuck is his break?\n\n Why are you suggesting he doesn't get one since his kids want to spend time with him? He's his own human and needs his own breaks from working 9-5 and childcare from 5 onwards. Really feels misogynistic that you're basically invalidating his need for a break for a few hours while it's perfectly fine for his wife to get an entire day to herself.", "I think I see what you're saying. The wife should only be allowed to go out with her sister once the kids are asleep?", "okay but there\u2019s a huge difference between switching days as a one time thing, and always playing video games while the kids are awake. \n\nshe gets several hours to herself on Saturdays, and he asked for a couple hours one single Sunday. his request is completely reasonable because he also deserves time to himself just as much as she does. \n\nhe already states that he takes over when he gets home from work, he normally plays games at night, and he never asks for \u201cme time\u201d to do anything. asking once is fine, in fact even wanting a couple hours every week would be okay, and it should be respected even if its just playing video games.", "No.  People need time for themselves sometimes.  Not just SAHP.  It helps with peoples mental health.  Take care of your mental health, and you become a better parent.  Quality over quantity.\n\nBesides, It sounds like he only wants to play video games Sunday mornings which means he still spends the rest of Sunday with his kids.  They still get time with their father on that day.", "And the rest of Sunday?? I am very confused about why people are acting like he\u2019s spending his entire Sunday gaming when it\u2019s only for a couple of hours in the morning. Are people aware that Sunday is way more than two hours long?", "Exactly. And he had his me time when the kids were asleep, then decided that his gaming buddy\u2019s workout schedule was more important than being available on Sundays. With three kids under six, they\u2019re both going to have very limited me time for at least a few years yet.", "I'm so glad my wife appreciates that gaming (and collecting) is my hobby, and doesn't want me to hide it away, or not play.\n\nOfc i don't play all the time, but it's so nice to not feel like i'm a burden or an idiot for liking to play video games.", "I don't know about that. My son is 3, if either of us need alone time we tell him we're going to take some space. The other parent does the parent stuff while alone time is taken. Baby boy asks for alone time as well, goes to his room and plays or reads (turns pages in his books).", "Yes, but she is the one who doesn't get any breaks when she's home with the kids all day. She is the one who doesn't get to eat warm lunch because she's feeding three toddlers. He gets a lunch break and a commute to himself, he used to get Saturday nights to game while having three small toddlers. I don't think that a couple hours once a week is asking for too much for the mother. What I do think is selfish is he only spends like 2 hours a day with his kids if he gets off work at 6, and he has every single week night to play his games when the kids are in bed. But he would rather make his wife take care of the kids alone for a portion of his only day with the kids because it's not \"fair\" that mom gets to speak to her sister and not be touched by small grubby hands for 3 hours a week.", "Well when its women infantilising women to make the man out to be an asshole, then yeah, it is pushing hating men", "Would also have her goofing off on the phone is essentially the same as playing videogames if she is scrolling through social media or watching videos", "I don\u2019t know this game but even if it\u2019s completely mindless game or wctivity, if that\u2019s how someone chooses to spend their \u201cme\u201d time; then it should be respected.", "I don't see that he issued it as an ultimatum. He gives his wife time for herself on a weekly basis and she in complete control over how she spends that time whether it is spent at home or getting out of the house.  All he is asking for that she extend the same courtesy to him. He would prefer to spend it at home but since it seems difficult for the kids and his wife to give him that personal time --it would be better for him to spend his personal time outside of the home so he can really focus on himself/his hobby/his source of relaxation. THE COMMUNICATION is the problem because he is trying to convey that having personal time that he can look forward to makes it easier to deal with the demands/stress of his roles as a working father/spouse. He understands the demands of being an full-time caregiver for their toddlers so he is happy to ensure that she has a weekly opportunity to help ease the burden. It would be awesome if she could see the situation from his point of view and return the grace/kindness/patience he shoes her. It's possible that you could look into a Sunday activity for your children that would allow your wife to start a special Sunday tradition and you could do something weekly with the kids as well.

If people disapprove of it, it's an ultimatum. The difference isn't in the semantics, it's in the connotation. For example, if a guy told his SAH wife \"If you get a job, I'll leave\", it would not be considered a \"boundary\", even though it's worded the exact same way as \"If you cheat, I'll leave\". No amount of focusing on himself would change that. Similarly, \"You better NOT hit me or I'll leave\" would not be viewed as an \"ultimatum\", even though it's worded the same way as the example of the ultimatum.
