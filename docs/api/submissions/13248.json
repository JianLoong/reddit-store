{"id": 13248, "submission_id": "122u9ux", "title": "AITA for not mixing pasta noodles with the sauce?", "selftext": "My husband and I have had this ongoing debate for the entirety of our relationship. When he makes pasta, he will mix the noodles and sauce together straightaway. When I make it, I leave the noodles and sauce separated until just before serving. If there are leftovers, I will store the noodles and sauce separately. Although each of us have our preferences, we typically leave it up to whoever is doing the cooking to decide how the sauce/noodles will be served and stored. \n\nI recently came back from a 2 month work assignment, and my return also happened to coincide with a bunch of my in-laws coming into town. My husband wanted to host a dinner at our home for his family and asked if I could take on all of the cooking. \n\nI'm normally the one to do most of the cooking in our relationship. I enjoy it and I would say that I'm pretty good at it - objectively better than he is. I've been complimented many times from many different people over different meals I've made. However, I am by no means a professional and I've never been asked to cook for such a large group before. I wasn't totally comfortable with taking on that role for this occasion, and plus I kind of wanted to chill and be lazy for a while after being away for work for an extended period of time. But my husband really wanted to impress his family so I begrudgingly agreed. \n\nI ended up making several different dishes, one of those being a bolognese sauce with pappardelle noodles. I made sure to plate it up really nice and topped it with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and basil. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.\n\nLater that evening, my husband pulled me aside and was clearly unhappy that I hadn't mixed the noodles and sauce altogether. His reasoning is that he and his entire family prefer everything mixed, and that I should've made it according to their preferences since I knew that. He said it made no sense to make it according to my preferences when I was the only person out of 15 that liked it that way. \n\nI told him if it were really that big of a deal, that *he* should've taken on all of the cooking. We went back and forth for a bit and I finally said, \"If I'm the one cooking, then I'm going to make it the way that *I* think is best. I don't care what everyone else's preferences are.\" That irritated him even further and he basically expressed that he thinks I was being rude and inconsiderate.\n\nIt's not like I ignored anyone's dietary restrictions - there were none. Cooking a multiple course meal by yourself for a large group is a lot of work and the fact that he had the audacity to *complain* about noodles and sauce is beyond irritating. \n\nIt's been a couple of weeks since this has happened and I haven't been cooking our dinners as I normally do. I told my husband that since he seems to be such a picky eater, he can figure it out himself. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679853768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122u9ux/aita_for_not_mixing_pasta_noodles_with_the_sauce/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's join forces lmao", "Found her post!\n\n\n\"I slept with an old flame during a work trip and my husband has no idea\n\nI met D in the 6th grade, science class to be exact. We weren't really friends for the first couple of years of knowing each other. We began talking more around the age of 13/14 and immediately clicked. We had a shared interest for a particular hobby, and once we bonded over that everything else snowballed. We started to develop feelings for each other, but due to my immaturity at the time I never really agreed to officially date. I will spare the details, but unfortunately we had a very painful falling out, and by the time high school came around we were no longer speaking.\n\nWe did eventually reconnect, but that was followed by several instances of going back and forth between being inseparable to no contact. It was always rooted in D's inability to be my friend because he still had romantic feelings for me and it made things difficult for him. \n\nD moved across the country not long after we graduated high school, and any contact we had going forward was always virtual. We finally got to a point where it seemed like it was possible for us to be just friends. I got into a long-term relationship and D was dating other people as well. My long-term relationship turned into a marriage, and I've now been with my husband, M, for a total of 6 years. After a couple of years of being married, feelings for D began to resurface. We would talk and text all the time. There were a lot of flirtatious messages being sent. Several times I found myself wanting to cross the line completely. D and I had never been together sexually and I found myself longing for that sort of encounter with him more and more. \n\nI think we both knew what we were doing was wrong. At that point it was pretty much a case of emotional cheating. So we went no contact again and stayed that way for quite some time. Until recently. \n\nI got a new job last year where I've had several opportunities to travel for work. I was recently asked to go to Phoenix for a 2 month assignment. Phoenix is where D lives. I hadn't seen him in *10 years* which feels crazy to put into words. I fought with myself not to reach out, but I couldn't help it in the end. I surprised him by showing up to his job (he owns a small caf\u00e9) with a couple of things I had collected over the years that I always wanted to give to him. Understandably he was in shock to see me standing there in the flesh, and I can say I practically felt the same way seeing him. I couldn't really get a read on how he felt about seeing me after so long, but I gave him the name of my hotel, and told him I'd be in the restaurant at 5pm if he wanted to catch up over dinner.\n\nHe came and we had such an amazing time chatting, reminiscing, laughing. Two hours flew by and I didn't want it to end. I asked if he wanted to come hang out in my hotel room for a while. I told myself that it was possible for us to just enjoy each other's company without crossing a boundary, but deep down I *wanted* to take it a step further. We hung out for a few more hours, drinking and laughing. Eventually we got tired. I laid down to clothes my eyes for a few seconds and he did the same. We inched closer together until we were basically spooning, and after a few minutes of laying like that I could feel him getting hard. I was so incredibly turned on, I really couldn't resist. I turned around and kissed him and I'm sure you can guess what happened next. \n\nIt was honestly the best sex of my *life*. I can't even describe what it felt like having him inside of me for the first time. Everything about it was absolutely perfect, from the pace, to the rhythm, the foreplay, everything. His hands on my body felt like electricity. I never orgasmed like that until I was with D.\n\nFrom then on we saw each other almost daily. We continued to sleep together and each time felt just as good if not better. Of course in the back of my mind I felt tremendous guilt, knowing that I was betraying my husband in the worst way possible. But it just felt too good to stop. Even writing this out now makes me feel a certain way.\n\nI got home from my work trip 3 weeks ago and my husband doesn't have a clue as to went on in Phoenix. I know I should end things with M but I'm scared to actually do it. I've built a life with him here and I know I'm an absolutely shitty, disgusting person for what I've done.\n\nI've already been asked to return to Phoenix for another 2 month assignment beginning in September. I've tried to reason with myself but in the end I just know I'm not going to be able to resist seeing D again. \"", "\"Divorce your husband because pasta sauce\" is legitimately one of the biggest over-reactions I've seen here and I've been sometimes accused of over-reacting to relationship conflicts.", "I feel strongly noodles shouldn\u2019t be served off anyone\u2019s penis but I assume that\u2019s not happening here.
