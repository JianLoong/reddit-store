So she has been doing the dishes as well as folding laundry and taking out the trash. I didn\u2019t know about their agreement and at end of the week because the dishes were done I just gave them the money. Then my 8 year old cried to me the 11 year old won\u2019t give her the money and the 11 year old said she was just doing a favor for him and he never promised her the money. \n\nBut she did do the dishes as well as her other chores so the next week after they both did their chores I gave $20 to my 8 year old to \u201cback pay\u201d her for the week she did both of their chores and didn\u2019t give my 11 year old anything. \n\nHe cried and tried to get his dad to gave him the money. Now my husband and I are arguing because he thinks I\u2019m too harsh with our 11 year old and $10 just enough to fight about.

If he\u2019s old enough to come up with this scam he\u2019s old enough to get the consequences", "NTA\n\nSounds like the only reason you're on here is because your husband made you feel bad for disciplining your son. Idk how your husband was raised but he clearly is a softy if he doesn't think this is a fair consequence for what your son did.", "NTA. \n\nI think it was a perfect solution. I don't understand, at all, why your husband thinks it's too harsh. It wasn't too harsh when the 8 year old got scammed?", "NTA. he lied and tricked her into doing work for him, now he\u2019s mad that he\u2019s facing consequences. too bad. now he\u2019ll know not to do to do it again", "Whoever does the chores gets the pay. It's really that simple. What messed up values is your husband trying to teach your son? \n\nNTA", "NTA. He tried to burn his lil sis out of $10 and he doesn't deserve an allowance if he didn't  complete his end of the bargain. What's your husband's reasoning for wanting to give him the money?", "Your husband is wrong. Don't teach your son that it's okay to do nothing and get paid. Don't teach him it's okay to use other people, especially family. NTA.", "NTA. A huge problem these days is parents not teaching their kids that actions have consequences. you taught your kid not only do actions have consequences, but the problems that arise by breaking their word / promises.", "NTA\n\nHe's old enough to know better and old enough to learn there are consequences", "NTA. 11yo just learnt that he has to pay his subcontractors.", "NTA.  He didn't earn the money.  Essentially he \"hired\" his sister to do the work for him so she deserves the money.  He would get nothing because he did nothing.", "How is this too harsh? But at the same time 10 dollars is nothing to fight over for?\n\nKids need healthy boundaries. Your son got his sister to do the work with a promise of money. The money was not paid and your son lied about the agreement. If you don't show him that actions have consequences he will do it again. You didn't 'steal' the money or anything, you repayed his debt to his sister. Its an important lesson.", "NTA\n\nOtherwise you teach both your children that lying and scheming is ok....", "NTA\n\nIt's not about $10. It's about teaching your son early about the importance of being an honourable person, and that cheating and manipulating people and lying for personal gain is not okay. \n\nYou literally didn't punish him for not doing his chores, or even technically withhold the $10. He just had a debt of $10 to his sister for a deal that he'd made with her, and you ensured that debt was paid. You put a lien on his allowance, as it were. This is what happens when people don't pay their debts: their creditors are allowed to seek the money owed them by appealing to the authorities.  You may actually want to have that talk with him as a follow-up, a reminder that this was not done to punish him, but to ensure that he kept his word and paid his debts, and that this is how things work in the world at large as well.", "NTA your son was being dishonest, broke the trust of his sister AND you, and is now reaping what he sowed.", "NTA. Your son needs to honor his obligations and lying about them won't get them anywhere. I don't know too many people who would just offer to do someone else's paying job for them out of the kindness of their heart, especially an 8y.o. and not expect something. \n\nThis will be a good life lesson for him.", "NTA. Hopefully he's learnt a valuable lesson.", "NTA. It's unclear who was telling the truth about whether the money was promised or not, but if the money is explicitly for doing the chores, whoever did the chores should get it.", "NTA your son is old enough to understand that his actions have consequences", "NTA - there was no way it was a \u201cfavor\u201d. He was trying to pay her to do his chores and backed out.\n\nIt\u2019s not about cost. It\u2019s about the principal of if.", "Nta thats reasonable and hes old enough he cant get away with cheating and rewarded for cheating", "NTA, that's what we call a teachable moment. Hopefully your son learns from this.", " Essentially he \"hired\" his sister to do the work for him so she deserves the money.", "NTA \n\nYour son tried to get his younger sibling to do his chores and keep the money for the chores. She will not be inclined to help him in the future.", "I'm with OP.  Tell Tom Sawyer he doesn't get pay if he shirks his chores.", "NTA, You did the right thing. Your son needs to understand that it is not fair to burden his sister with the chores he\u2019s assigned to and he needs to learn that as a family member he has to help out as well. He also needs to learn he cannot go around making promises then breaking them afterwards and take advantage of others. Your husband is trying to teach your son that it\u2019s okay to ditch his responsibilities in favor of being lazy, he has broken both yours and his sister\u2019s trust and he should know by now that trust takes a while to repair", "NTA, and please explain to both your husband and son that even if it was a \"favor,\" that wasn't part of the original agreement. You get money for chores. He did not do his chores. End of story. Tell your kiddo that it's not about whether or not the chores get done, but about teaching responsibility, and he did not learn the lesson. If he continues with this attitude, you might just promote his sister to \"management\" and she gets to check his work and take a portion of his income. LOL", "Info - why didn't you just force your son to give your daughter the money he owed her?", "NTA... should of gave her the money the same week she did all chores for  him to fully learn... your husband is a AH he needs to realize the older your son gets he cant have others do his work and expect to get paid or rewarded for not doing anything....", "NTA.  I\u2019m sure your husband understands the concept of work for money. \nIt\u2019s even more disturbing that your husband thinks that if a boy does it, he should get money but if a girl does it for him, then it\u2019s a favor. Bad message to send.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a natural consequence, which imo is the best way to parent. He won\u2019t do it again.", "He promised her the money he needs to give it to her.  She did his chores.  A deals a deal.", "Gender pay gaps start young these days.\n\n(Edit: NTA)", "NTA.\n\nThis is actually a good teaching lesson.\n\nThat if you're not willing to put in the work then you don't get the pay to reflect the job done.", "NTA- He tried to trick his sister and found out the consequences. If he did what he said he would do, he would have gotten the money as well. But, since he owed his sister, you were fair.", "NTA honestly this title is very misleading,, this felt like an extremely appropriate reaction to the situation.", "NTA. Sounds totally fair for this time, \nbut let your daughter know that in the future, she should get the agreement in writing from him first, and they both have to sign it.", "NTA NTA NTA!! Your son sounds like an enterprising young man, who may as well learn now rather than later that there are consequence to not paying your vendors. It's not about the money, it's about fairness and honesty (he lied to you to cheat his sister!) which are values worth feeling some pain over.", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing\u2014it\u2019s only fair. And your husband needs to get it together.", "It's really that simple.", "NTA. I would have taken the money off of him the very week I learned about what he'd done. *And* he would have been grounded for two weeks for duping his younger sister into doing his chores: one week for the duping, another for trying to get out of his chores. Honestly, if this were a few years ago, for the duping alone I'd probably have sent him outside to get a switch. (But according to the latest research corporal punishment has more detrimental effects than positive ones, so I've since adjusted my parenting toolkit.)\n\nYou *should* be stricter on the eldest child, especially if the behavior you're correcting is them taking advantage of a younger sibling. Your husband is an enabler and he should really examine why he's so willing to give that kind of behavior a pass.", "What is wrong with your husband? Is this just boys being boys or something? Does he want him to grow up into a shiesty jerk who renegs on deals?", "NTA in fact I think you should have added additional chores for him to do because he lied to you & to his sister.", "NTA. I was actually in a similar situation as a child, one time my older sister convinced me to do her chores and she would give me all the tv privileges for the weekend (we didn't received money for doing the chores lol we just had to do it) and I accepted it. But during the weekend she stole the remote, and she put on her series on the tv, when I complained to my mom she just said we had to share the tv and take turns (dismissing our previous negotiation) and I remember feeling so betrayed by both my mom and sister. I had to learn the hard way to not trust so easily, but she didn't get her lesson at that time.\n\nYour son didn't do his chores, he doesn't get anything. If he is old enough to trick his sister, he's old enough to understand that actions have consequences.", "NTA babe good job on the fair discipline", "NTA - He scammed his little sister. It's not even a punishment. He's just not being paid for work he didn't do. That's how life works.", "NTA. You need to nip this stuff in the bud when it's only $10 at stake.", "NTA. Your son got paid $10 last week for doing no work, he essentially had an advance on his allowance for working the following week. It\u2019s net zero at this point. I think you are being completely fair in not paying him this week.  Being a hard-ass would be imposing more punishment and also somewhat justified.

Your husband is enabling this behavior by taking that stance. Unless your 11 yr old has some sort of learning or behavioral disorder, I think his age is plenty old enough to begin learning these lessons.

Your husband would be teaching him entitlement. He is not entitled to money for work he didn't do. It's that simple. We haven't even gotten into him duping his younger sister into doing his work.", "Oof you're NTA\n\nAsk your husband if your son should learn this lesson now in a safe space, or as an adult in the real world, and tell him to really think about how that's going to go. You're teaching them how to survive life and every lesson is a building block for success when they leave your house.", "That's also bullshit though, because there's still an imbalance of power between an 11 year old and and an 8 year old, so in all likelihood, any such \"favour\" would have been coerced, even without the offer of money. And apparently also an imbalance between a boy and a girl in this house, based on Dad's position on his son exploiting his sister. He just wants to condone it.\n\nDig your heels in, Mom. You're NTA for wanting to teach your son integrity and ethics. And even more importantly, for not wanting to teach your daughter she should go through life accepting people taking advantage of her. All the generations before her did more than our share of that. That's not on the menu anymore.", "I'm with you on this one. I'm assuming that if one week neither of them did their chores, nobody would get any money. And that if one of them did their chores, but the other didn't, only the one who did them gets paid. \n\nI'd probably quibble if one kid was racing to do all the chores to make $20/wk and stiff their sibling, but you said they alternate responsibility, so it shouldn't come up without an agreement between them.", "A favor is consensual, though, and changing the terms of a deal renders prior consent null and void under the rule of sibling law", "From the story it sounded like your daughter was upset quite immediately after getting the money though, how did he spend it so quickly?\n\nNTA but I do think this should have been communicated to your son as soon as you knew of the situation.", "Can't give back what you don't have.
