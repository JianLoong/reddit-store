Don't teach him it's okay to use other people, especially family. NTA.", "NTA. A huge problem these days is parents not teaching their kids that actions have consequences. you taught your kid not only do actions have consequences, but the problems that arise by breaking their word / promises.", "NTA\n\nHe's old enough to know better and old enough to learn there are consequences", "NTA. 11yo just learnt that he has to pay his subcontractors.", "NTA.  He didn't earn the money.  Essentially he \"hired\" his sister to do the work for him so she deserves the money.  He would get nothing because he did nothing.", "How is this too harsh? But at the same time 10 dollars is nothing to fight over for?\n\nKids need healthy boundaries. Your son got his sister to do the work with a promise of money.

It's about teaching your son early about the importance of being an honourable person, and that cheating and manipulating people and lying for personal gain is not okay. \n\nYou literally didn't punish him for not doing his chores, or even technically withhold the $10. He just had a debt of $10 to his sister for a deal that he'd made with her, and you ensured that debt was paid. You put a lien on his allowance, as it were. This is what happens when people don't pay their debts: their creditors are allowed to seek the money owed them by appealing to the authorities.  You may actually want to have that talk with him as a follow-up, a reminder that this was not done to punish him, but to ensure that he kept his word and paid his debts, and that this is how things work in the world at large as well.", "NTA your son was being dishonest, broke the trust of his sister AND you, and is now reaping what he sowed.", "NTA.

Your son needs to understand that it is not fair to burden his sister with the chores he\u2019s assigned to and he needs to learn that as a family member he has to help out as well. He also needs to learn he cannot go around making promises then breaking them afterwards and take advantage of others. Your husband is trying to teach your son that it\u2019s okay to ditch his responsibilities in favor of being lazy, he has broken both yours and his sister\u2019s trust and he should know by now that trust takes a while to repair", "NTA, and please explain to both your husband and son that even if it was a \"favor,\" that wasn't part of the original agreement. You get money for chores. He did not do his chores. End of story. Tell your kiddo that it's not about whether or not the chores get done, but about teaching responsibility, and he did not learn the lesson.

Your son sounds like an enterprising young man, who may as well learn now rather than later that there are consequence to not paying your vendors. It's not about the money, it's about fairness and honesty (he lied to you to cheat his sister!) which are values worth feeling some pain over.", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing\u2014it\u2019s only fair. And your husband needs to get it together.", "It's really that simple.", "NTA. I would have taken the money off of him the very week I learned about what he'd done. *And* he would have been grounded for two weeks for duping his younger sister into doing his chores: one week for the duping, another for trying to get out of his chores. Honestly, if this were a few years ago, for the duping alone I'd probably have sent him outside to get a switch. (But according to the latest research corporal punishment has more detrimental effects than positive ones, so I've since adjusted my parenting toolkit.)\n\nYou *should* be stricter on the eldest child, especially if the behavior you're correcting is them taking advantage of a younger sibling. Your husband is an enabler and he should really examine why he's so willing to give that kind of behavior a pass.", "What is wrong with your husband? Is this just boys being boys or something? Does he want him to grow up into a shiesty jerk who renegs on deals?", "NTA in fact I think you should have added additional chores for him to do because he lied to you & to his sister.", "NTA. I was actually in a similar situation as a child, one time my older sister convinced me to do her chores and she would give me all the tv privileges for the weekend (we didn't receive money for doing the chores lol we just had to do it) and I accepted it. But during the weekend she stole the remote, and she put on her series on the tv, when I complained to my mom she just said we had to share the tv and take turns (dismissing our previous negotiation) and I remember feeling so betrayed by both my mom and sister. I had to learn the hard way to not trust so easily, but she didn't get her lesson at that time.\n\nYour son didn't do his chores, he doesn't get anything. If he is old enough to trick his sister, he's old enough to understand that actions have consequences.", "NTA babe good job on the fair discipline", "NTA - He scammed his little sister. It's not even a punishment. He's just not being paid for work he didn't do. That's how life works.", "NTA. You need to nip this stuff in the bud when it's only $10 at stake.", "NTA. Your son got paid $10 last week for doing no work, he essentially had an advance on his allowance for working the following week. It\u2019s net zero at this point. I think you are being completely fair in not paying him this week.  Being a hard-ass would be imposing more punishment and also somewhat justified.

Part of it was teaching him what is and isn't ok but it could also be taken in a feminist way by showing him that gender doesn't matter you should treat everyone with respect.\n\nThe kid wasn't being misogynistic but something to note is that he has been shown an example of accountability and fair treatment which is also extended to girls.\n\nI don't think the incident was misogyny, it was feminism. I think it was about raising a better generation of boys who don't view women as less.", "Oh lmao hahah thank you sorry about that", "It's really not that serious. It's a kid trying to scam their younger sibling. A tale as old as time. Genders have nothing to do with it as it happens with any mix of older-younger siblings gender-wise.", "You're allowed to be wrong.", "Not if he plays fortnite. I babysat a kid who would immediately spend all his money there as soon as he got it. Kids these days don't have physically go out to spend money anymore.", "Exact same as the Kodak Dad. Interesting to know there's another name for it :)", "So Robin Williams dad before he went drag in Mrs. Doubtfire...", "Then he should have done the chores. You don\u2019t do the chores, you don\u2019t get paid for the chores. That is an extremely reasonable consequence, it\u2019s barely even a punishment.", "It's a bigger deal to an 8 year old.", "The daughter is also watching her brother get $10 for doing nothing and lying about it, if they both get the money.", "I see you hit a sweet spot where your brother was gullible AND girls were not yucky. Well played!", "Oh not condoning the $10 isn't a big deal statement. \n\nThe value of money is a very real lesson. Dad handled it poorly.  They had an agreement, it happened and the 11 year old tried to back out. \n\nOne week. Maybe there's more going on but I'll take it as isolated. Great discussion topic once the parents realized what happened with the family. \"From now on tasks are not transferable. \" Set expectations from there.", "An 8-year-old is old enough to learn not to trust her brother or her dad, which may be even worse in the long run. Hurray for Mom!", "Lol, we used to trade nickels for dimes because they were bigger coins, so they must be worth more! XD I fully agree this is just a sibling thing to do. I know I made worse deals with my sisters (older and younger) because I could/did get away with it. I did have a healthy dose of guilt once it had time to fester, though, and I'd often reverse the deals to assuage my conscience.\n\nBut yeah, backing out of the deal, too? That's crossing a whole other line. Where is the honor? The deceit is only fun when you're clever enough to set the rules in your favor, not breaking them to get ahead. Initially, I read the post as, \"chore money is X amount, and brother pockets Y amount and pays sister to do the work at a % of X.\" Not the case, and the reality was worse. Yeek!", ">I think the idea was that it could lead to a more misogynistic mind set later on.\n\nEXACTLY.\n\nYes, right now this was just older sibling taking advantage of younger sibling -- which is *also* an unbalanced power dynamic.\n\nSo if brother gets away with it, he's going to learn that you can take advantage of people who are younger than you or who are less experienced/know less than you.\n\nBut if dad overrides mom's action, then brother is *also* going to learn that: \n\n- what dad says is more important than what mom says\n- when sister is upset, there's no problem, but when brother is upset, things have to be fixed to make brother happy\n- mom takes sister's side, dad takes brother's side \n\n*Right now,* this is all happening in the microcosm of their 4-person family, but these kids exist in the world and live in society, where they will both be bombarded with messages that 1) if you are stronger, louder, have more power/money/supporters, you get away with taking advantage of others; and 2) men get (and \"deserve\") more respect than women.\n\nNo, the kid did not act out of intentional, malicious misogyny... but *how the parents address the situation* plants the seeds of the lessons they will learn, **including** the power and gender dynamics involved.", "uh, no, I actually very much did not spin that intentionally. It's one sentence, I can own that I should've expanded, which I then went to do in the comments for clarity. Turns out the majority of my comments on Reddit don't blow up to over 2,000 upvotes. But you're very much being \"that guy\" with this one, so thanks for that.", "Yup. He was a shitty parent and partner while he was married, and as an adult I can say that his ex-wife did the right thing in divorcing him.", "If it keeps people from being sexist towards women AND men then I'll happily be that guy. \n\nHave a good one.", "You too!"]}
