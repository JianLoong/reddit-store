There are so many people looking for adoption, especially for babies, you can meet them and check them before even giving birth but they do not even use that option for the sake of their kid. They just fled and didn't even make sure he was in good hands. And now again they weren't able to do a bare minimum of meeting your simple condition so they could stay in the child's life? I just can't muster up sympathy for that kind of people even if they have medical bills or a funeral. \n\nAnyways NTA, you have a right not to give them any more chances, they got a second one already.", "Can\u2019t believe people are calling you an AH over this.

You made your rules clear, and they broke them. You're not the bad guy here; they are. They had the opportunity to be in Dylan's life, and they blew it by asking for money.

He also needs to understand that the rule the violated was asking for money - a lot of it. So if he ever chooses to let them into his life, he should only do so because he wants that for himself.", "NTA.  You set a boundary and they violated it. \n\nIf you let them getting away with pushing that boundary back, they're gonna keep trying to violate it and just make interacting with them frustrating on your part.", "INFO\n\nMy only concern is Dylan. Do you think that one day when he figures out they really were his birth parents that he will be angry that you curtailed their relationship?\n\nDo you think having a relationship with them benefitted Dylan at all?\n\nDon't think of Dylan right now. Think of 20 year old Dylan. What does he want you to do in this moment?", "NTA. Sounds like your money is what they were most interested in here", "NTA.

Asking to borrow money to bury a recently dead relative is quite a bit different than asking for money to go see a concert you know?", "NTA they aren't there for Dylan just using his association to you as a potential income.\n\nYou're a good dude", "The only real question here which everyone seems to ignore is what is in Dylan\u2019s best interest. Seems as if he cared enough to ask about them.  Yes OP can have rules and if they are in Dylan\u2019s best interest more power to him.  But I wonder whose interests are at play here? His birth parents asked for money after over 2 years of being involved so I doubt money was their game plan. Whatever.  But it\u2019s Dylan\u2019s interests that really should matter here, and if Dylan is better off having a relationship with his birth parents even if they committed the cardinal sin of asking for money and then apologizing", "NTA.

All we know about them is that they lived on a bus at one point and had a baby young.\n\nWho even calls people hippies in 2023?", "Right because you know the dad puts money above the kid when strangers ask for thousands of dollars. Or maybe the kids will learn to not be taken for an idiot by people. There is no ego here, the dad made specific rules and explicitly told the bio parents that if they were violated then there will be no further contact with Dylan. So it seems like the bio parents don't give a fuck about the relationship with Dylan since they did indeed ask for a lot money. It's called consequences. Which is also something the dad is teaching Dylan.", "I mean, they did fully agree not to ask for money, and then turn around and try to get OP to give them money.", "If they didn't provide the hospital with an address and were living on the road it would probably be really hard for social services to find them. If the adoptive father is older it wouldn't shock me if he describes them as hippies. My parents are in their 50s and they would describe people like that. Obviously people write fake stuff on reddit all the time, so I am not necessarily vouching for the op, I just don't think that paragraph specifically makes it fake.", "Ex ER admissions clerk here: people put down fake contact info like addresses, emails, phone numbers, DOB when they're trying to avoid bills or the police. It's not that hard to make something up and hospitals can only force you to stay in very specific situations. You don't even have to sign the AMA forms, you just tell at least 1 staff member that you no longer want treatment and leave.\n\nA hippy type living on the road putting down an outdated or family member's / friend's address, not giving their ID to put on file, then bailing isn't as abnormal as you're thinking. I once had someone look me dead in the eyes and tell me their address was 123 Fake Street and just wrote it down without arguing.", "Would that be because rules are imposed as safety measures when in reference to kids? Or maybe because having a rule that locks your money for people with a connection to your kids makes it safer to know who are close for the good of the kid and not for money? Or maybe because OP has money and therefore has experience with people asking for money just because he has it and those kind of people  are not safe to be around kids? Or maybe because it\u2019s a very bad sign when people who are not close to you and whose kid you raised ask for money?", "Yes because that was a boundary he had set at the very beginning of their relationship. Thay boundary ensures they are seeing \u2018Dylan\u2019 for the right reasons. They went against it. They didn\u2019t reach out to their child mind they were tracked down? See now there should be shame not for\nBeing poor no, but for abandoning their child. Don\u2019t think you are quite grasping that and instead are focused on finances.", "They have no rights to that son. THEY ABANDON HIM. Their \"rights\" were terminated. It was a kindness for them to see the boy...one that they didn't value. \n\nThere are a myriad of other places to go for help with medical bills and funeral expenses. They chose to go to a near stranger who they thought they could exploit...with no regard for how it might affect the boy they had already abandoned once. They prioritized money over their relationship with OP's son.", "Nah, nah. THEY CHOSE TO BE HIPPIES. They chose to be free over money. Great for them, bad for their debts.", "They moral and just punishment for abandoning a baby at the hospital without doing the basic work of talking to someone about placing that baby for adoption is being cut off from the child you abandoned. That they were allowed to meet the child at all after being tracked down was going above and beyond.", "I wasn't assuming anything, I even noted that option in my previous comment in case you didn't read it before replying.\n\nBut if someone's last option is to ask someone else for help who has clearly stated beforehand that they won't do that exact thing then perhaps that person might mention that they've tried everything else. Just a thought.\n\nAnd also to make it clear they're not just looking for a handout, try to offer to repay, either with money or by work whatever assistance they're are asking.\n\nThey did neither.", "Seriously?  This happened?  Teenagers??  I'm going to find a link but thanks to everyone in this thread for bringing attention to the safe haven thing.\n\nAlso, the audacity of asking this dude for money, they're not ready to meet that kid. \n\n  it's bizarre to ask someone you barely know for that kind of money.  Funerals and medical bills aren't pocket change!  Did they even meet the kid before asking?  Geez....\n\nEdit: found it!   2008 in Nebraska \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna26887181", "LMBO...I can understand the need to abandon a teenager. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Yep that story is true, buttt it was multiple parents attempting to drop off teenagers", "Did it really even happen? You've got to admire a real law that was so poorly thought out that even a middle school Model UN wouldn't make the mistake.", "> the bio mother/parents have still some choice in the question of the adoptive family, if you leave the baby in the hospital it can lessen its chances to get a nice home/family.\n\nNot for a healthy infant. Heathy infants are in exceptionally high demand for adoption, particularly white infants. And the adoptive parent would still have to pass all the evaluation and background checks for fostering in this case. This was not an instance where the child was unlikely to find a good, permanent placement, or where the bio parent was needed as a safeguard.", "No it does not. Not without evidence of a crime. \n\nHospital are safe havens specifically so women who do not want to be found have a safe place to leave an infant. The police do not pour resources into finding out if a crime occurred. There are far too many documented crimes to chase down.", "Would that change the fact that OP has no obligation whatsoever to lend them money even if they aren\u2019t poor by choice?", "There\u2019s no ego in \u201che knows I\u2019m the only parent\u201d? Consequences that are just are not the same as punishment. This is punishment. Punishment burns bridges. I just feel bad for the kid dude. Arguing me won\u2019t change anything for him. I\u2019m going to stop answering you now bc this is pointless", "Turned around = 2 years later.", "Now you're working even harder to invent those justifications. Why?", "I might be wrong but I don\u2019t get the vibe that OP would listen if they tried to explain or set up repayment.", "Look I think we will never agree on this since we have different views on parental responsibilities once one decides to proceed with the pregnancy.", "OP has absolutely no obligation to give them money. Period.\n\nOP also clearly doesn\u2019t like them and uses loaded language to describe them in order to sway our responses.", "It\u2019s called induction. Invention is another thing.", "Probably OP wouldn't, nor should that be expected.\n\nYet if they didn't even try? One can draw some conclusions of what kind of people they are.", "> one decides to proceed with the pregnancy.\n\nPost doesn't indicate anything about abortion laws in their location.", "It's either or both. But what it isn't is an answer to the question that was asked.", "Ten years ago, it was anything goes.", "Nah, an induction can\u2019t be an invention and you would know that if you knew the meaning of the term. You would also know the answer to your question because of the nature of inductions and it\u2019s purpose."]}
