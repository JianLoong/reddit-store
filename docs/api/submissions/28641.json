I look nothing like my 3 siblings and during an argument with my mom a few years ago, I overheard him mention that he didnt believe I was his. Later on during an argument between the two of us he also said that he didn't even think I was his kid. He immediately back peddled and said he was just angry and didn't mean it, but it haunts me. It's been 2 years and it just lingers in the back of my mind. I mentioned doing a paternity test but he said no he wouldn't agree to it because I was his and he didn't want to. He refused to talk about it after that.\n\nI mentioned taking a paternity to my sister(24F) and she was adamant that it was a bad idea. She said it would only start arguments and that our mother would have never cheated on him. She is the spitting image of my dad, as is our younger brother and the youngest sibling we have looks like a combination of my mom and dad.\n\nI told her I wouldn't do it, however I still planned to. I was trying to figure out how I was going to get a sample from either a sibling or my dad, but  my fiance (26M) told me that I would be a huge asshole for saying I wouldn't and then doing it anyways. I argued that none of them understood what it felt like and neither did he. It blew up and he insists that all I'm doing is being dramatic and trying to hurt everyone. We went to bed angry last night, and now I'm worried that I am going to cause unnecessary drama, especially if it comes back he is my bio dad and they find out I did the test.\n\nSo would I be the asshole for not telling any of them? I know they're never going to agree to it, so I feel like it's my only option.\n\n\nETA: I realized I never mentioned how I planned to get a sample. My youngest brother is very very close to me, and I haven't asked but I believe if I do he'd be willing to give me a sample to see if we are full siblings. I was discussing that with my fiance when he said I'd be a huge asshole for going behind everyone else's back. \n\nI did not make that very clear in the post, sorry about that.", "created_utc": 1696947318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174mbrg/wibta_for_doing_a_paternity_test_behind_my/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can even mention it to your sibling to see if he wants to do with you. they even have ones that can show you medical information so you can say you want it for that. It\u2019s not as accurate as a paternity test but it might show you enough to have an answer. And it has the option that you can add it to the database and they\u2019ll contact you with any familial matches.", "NTA.\n\nThe arsehole here is a Dad that keeps claiming you are *not* his, so he must have reasons for saying it.

The ethnicity ancestry may not align with what you have been told of your family's heritage.  See who it connects you to - others who have done it that results may show familial connection. You may find \"relatives\" you already know or people you've never met and no idea how you are linked.  \n\nBasically, getting at it thru the \"back-door\" without asking your sibs or parents to do the test too.\n\nAfter you see and understand the results of your test, choose where to go from there.", "NTA if your brother gives you the sample to do it\n\nIt's *your* DNA.

If you are his biological daughter, that means you have to look at how and why you feel so isolated from your siblings. And your questions about why he thought you might not be his will still be unanswered.\n\nIf he\u2019s not your bio dad? This is an ENORMOUS can of worms. Are you prepared to find out your mother was raped? Or that she cheated? Or even that *none* of your siblings are your dad\u2019s kids? Just looking like him means nothing, it could be a coincidence, or someone else in his family fathered them. It\u2019s even possible your parents sought fertility treatments and you\u2019re a mix-up.\n\nOr your parents could totally shut down. Refuse to even talk about it.

How old is your brother?  If he's also an adult, of course he can consent to help you with this.\n\nLastly, beware of what you learn.

That's not a bad thing at all.", "NTA. Yes, it might have repercussions but you should know the truth and after your dad's comment, he has no right to object.

Altho you could do an open ancestor tree online and see if you have matches with complete strangers.....that would tell you something", "I would ask you a series of questions first.  What do you hope to accomplish with this?  Do you think you're going to go off and find your biological father if it isn't your Dad?  Are you going to confront your Mom if that's the case?  Are you going to tell your Dad?  What happens in the future when decisions about the care of your parents need to be made - do you not want to be included because you're \"not family\"?  Will this make your Dad any  less your Dad?  \n\nWill it make anyone happy to hear that you're not his child?  Do you want your parents to divorce? Do you want your siblings, Mom, Dad, and yes, your fianc\u00e9e to always question your decisions and whether or not you're doing what you said you would do? Are you prepared to show your fianc\u00e9e your texts and emails for the rest of your life every time you write one, because your word can't be trusted?  I'm not saying that should happen, but it very well could.  \n\nAnd what happens if you ARE his child?  What, you just forget it and move on?  Your fianc\u00e9e won't forget it.  All he'll remember is you broke your word against the better judgement of literally everyone else in your family. \n\nWhat if you get caught or found out?  Even if the test reveals you ARE his daughter, your Mom will always have that lingering doubt in her head.  That you, her daughter, could have thought that about her.  Everyone involved has said they don't want to do the test.  If you try to get a sample and they find out, then what? Are you ready for a huge blowout? \n\nAnd will all of that be worth it?  \n\nI get that you have questions.  But those questions don't change your reality - you're an adult, you don't need any father other than what you've got.  The only slight way this could be, at least to me, justified is if you aren't his bio daughter, and your bio father has some important medical information you need to know.  \n\nI'm gonna go with YTA, because you really don't seem to care about any of the opinions or feelings of anyone you love in this situation.  You're just blazing forward with what you want because you want it.  You're willing to destroy everything in your life...for a hunch.  And frankly, not even that great a hunch.", "NTA.  Perhaps start with an ancestry.com type test to see if you have any matches out there.

You are anywhere between 0% - 100%(twin) similar to a full sibling, although that's obviously not the average. I'm not sure of all the techniques they use. You might be able to check your X chromosome against your sisters or something I guess. And then you have to account for the likelihood that the bio dad is related to the unwitting dad. Which is also depressingly common. \n\nI would get the answer for yourself. It sounds like your dad wouldn't mind knowing the answer too.

OP has every right to find out where she comes from.\n\n> Will it make anyone happy to hear that you're not his child? Do you want your parents to divorce? \n\nNOT OP's fault.\n\n>Do you want your siblings, Mom, Dad, and yes, your fianc\u00e9e to always question your decisions and whether or not you're doing what you said you would do? \n\nThey had NO RIGHT to make this unreasonable demand of her. Imagine telling someone not to pursue the truth about their biological parents because it might make your family uncomfortable.\n\nIt is an astonishingly selfish ask.\n\n>Are you prepared to show your fianc\u00e9e your texts and emails for the rest of your life every time you write one, because your word can't be trusted? I'm not saying that should happen, but it very well could.\n\nAnd, if it does, OP should kick the fianc\u00e9 to the curb. Bad enough he couldn't support her at a time when she felt embattled and supremely vulnerable.", "I think your fianc\u00e9 not being on board is confusing since it\u2019s causing you so much anxiety, but it also seems like a lot of these comments aren\u2019t touching on another outcome that is an option. \n\nYou could\u2026 not say anything? Afterword. Especially if you can get a sample from a sibling discreetly, it\u2019s totally up to you what you (hopefully guided by a therapist) decide to do with the information. \n\nYour parents, especially your dad, are the ones who put this toxin out there. If you find out he\u2019s not your dad, I would loop your siblings in asking for advice from the ones you\u2019re closest to and moving out to the least close. Those relationships sound like ones that could really take a hit, so doing damage control first would be ideal. If your dad isn\u2019t your bio-dad, it could end your parents\u2019 marriage and also destroy your mom\u2019s reputation, BUT THAT WOULD NOT BE YOUR FAULT?! THEY are the ones whose actions (potential affair and throwing that in you, their child\u2019s, face) have led to this point. YOU are the one dealing with it, and that\u2019s so upsetting.\n\nI think do the test without telling anyone except maybe your youngest sibling/ a trusted friend who is not connected to anyone else involved. I hesitate to say exclude your fianc\u00e9, but only include them if you can really trust them. \n\nIt sounds like not knowing has been eating you alive, and that\u2019s bs to expect you alone to just deal with it to, what? Protect everyone else? Find out the answer and then put good time and thought into what you should do then.", "I would argue that those loved ones don't care about OP's opinions and wants. They are looking out for their best interests, not hers. Since they have no respect for her, but are demanding it from her, too bad so sad. A woman's got to look out for herself when others are not.", "I didn't want to mention everything in the post that truly leads me to believe he might not be. And I didn't want to say the biggest reason for needing to know because it scares me the most, but I think this comment makes me think I may have to say it.\n\nHe told me who he thinks my real bio dad is before he decided to back peddle on it. They were family friends of ours when I was younger and as an adult I had a brief relationship with one of the sons. We dated for a while and the idea that I may have been physical with a half sibling absolutely haunts me. He knew about the relationship and voiced his opinion when we were together that he didn't like it (we fought about it back then but he never brought up why).\n\nMy relationship with my parents hasn't been good for a while. We don't speak much anymore, but you're right about my siblings and fiance. I don't want to ruin my relationship with them. I don't want them to think differently of me. \n\nMy siblings don't know about the identity of the other guy being my bio dad, but my fiance does. He has done nothing but help me get through that awful initial phase of that.", "Most of your reply is blaming OP, who is merely the victim of her parents' secrets and lies.\n\nIf her loved ones are jerks because she wants the truth then she is better off without them.", "My dad has told me who he thinks the bio dad is. If my dad isn't my bio dad I won't be going to the other guy for a test, I don't want him in my life (I know him). Confronting my mom is something I also don't want to do, I don't feel like it would bring me any peace from doing so. Our relationship isn't great anyways and we don't speak much. A lot of this is for my own peace of mind, which is hard for me to come by when it relates to this. I'll likely do something like Ancestry if I don't go forward with getting a sample from my family.", "I would avoid 23andme due to their current data breach. Unless you can find something that shows they solved the issue and are taking the necessary precautions to prevent this stuff, it's better to go a different route.", "I have mentioned in the post I would not be taking DNA without anyone's permission, I would be asking my brother for a sample and not telling the rest of my family.", "I was a rookie manager and I had an experienced one told me that exact thing.  As long as it was legal, ethical, and didn't blatantly go against policy just do it and if they get pissed, ask for forgiveness.", "I think I do want to keep it to myself. I would hope my brother wouldn't tell anyone else I did but I can't guarantee that and it's not fair for me to have him just keep it a secret from all of them. I wouldn't want them to all be mad at him later if they found out so it would be a real discussion before we do it.", "I don't know where I sit with my parents at this point in my life. It's not a good relationship and we don't speak much. My siblings however are extremely close to me, especially my sister who I went to first. The question of how my siblings would react is what bothers me. I don't want anyone else to know the results, just me, but I'm sure they'll want to know if I did do it. It complicates everything for sure.", "Yeah, the fiancee is being almost unbelievably AH-ish.\n\nI don't get what his problem is. If this is his default attitude OP really SHOULD reconsider the relationship.\n\nImagine your SO is going through something this emotionally turbulent and you add on to her stress by giving her crap for how she's handling it.\n\nYikes.", "I would be having my brothers DNA tested with his consent as stated in the post", "NTA.  Do the test. It will finally answer the question that is eating at you. What you do with the information is up to you.\n\nEvery human has this innate need to know where they come from, where they belong. Your dad is being a jerk about using this against you in arguments. You have done nothing wrong.  The DNA information may help you in the future. What if your \"bio\" sperm donor has different racial characteristics and you give birth to a bi-racial child? Your fiance could think you were cheating on him. What about medical information you may need? You need answers.", "Here is the thing. This is supposition. You don't know anything. Are you really willing to blow up your family over this? You have grown up with these people. I just don't see an upside to this. Who knows what you would find out. Doing without your family's consent wouldn't even be legal and without their knowledge amounts to that.", "Eh. So it isn\u2019t really cheating then? Not to mention they may have had a threesome", "Then I see no reason to proceed.  You do deserve the know the truth and put this issue to bed once and for all.  I do get that your dad (bio or not) is the one who raised you and that matters.  If your mom betrayed him, that certainly is not on him or you.  That said, sometimes children do look different and that does not always mean there was a betrayal.  We all carry varied genes and it's all in how they combine.", "I appreciate this reply to the comment. \n\nI would like to say my fiance is an incredible man who would never hurt me and trusts me with every fiber of his being. We both had access to each other's phones and emails, not because we look through them but we ask each other to send texts, make phone calls, reply to emails ect. So I'm not worried about that from him. \n\nIt surprised me we got into an argument about it because we rarely have fights at all especially not heated ones. I should also say that we don't curse or call each other names but we were both angry once it progressed.\n\nHowever I plan to talk to him again tonight now that we're calmer. He was his normal self this morning and we agreed we'd sit down together after work so we wouldn't have a heavy conversation before work. I'll try to update on what he says then because I'm confused on his opinion of this.", "My fiance and my parents don't get along. I trust him with all of my heart and I know that he would never tell them any results. \n\nAnd this is going to sound ridiculous to a lot of people but my parents marriage definitely wouldn't end over me not being his kid. If anything any ties I have left to them would be severed by them. My relationship with this isn't great to begin with and it's already not clear if my mom did or didn't cheat on my dad because they were on again off again when she got pregnant. She claims she did kiss the guy my dad thinks might be my bio dad but she said nothing else happened. They won't talk about it more than that.\n\nAnything that has to do with him potentially not being my dad as always and only come up in arguments between each other and me. \n\nIm going to talk to my fiance more about this after work. We don't fight often and since we've both had time to cool down we'll be able to have a real conversation about what happened last night. We rarely get heated at all so I may come back and update on what he says.", "Valid.", "Can you get in touch with the other guy? If so, you can do the test with him and your family probably wouldn't find out.", "> the idea that I may have been physical with a half sibling absolutely haunts me\n\nI absolutely understand why you feel like that. It violates our social rules. But you didn\u2019t marry him, you didn\u2019t have his child. If he was a half-sibling, it\u2019s a sad, weird thing that happened. But there\u2019s nothing to feel gross about or ashamed or haunted. It\u2019s in the past.\n\nThink of it like this: almost every baby, at some point, plays with their own poopy diaper. Some of them eat it. That\u2019s incredibly gross and disgusting.\n\nBut we\u2019re not *ashamed* that we did that as infants or toddlers. It\u2019s what happened when we didn\u2019t know better. That was then. It doesn\u2019t reflect on who you are a person now, or mean you\u2019re disgusting and contaminated because you unknowingly did something icky years ago.", "Just continue to be honest. Broken trust is like a ripped bedsheet. It can be sewn back together, but that seam will be ever present.", "Yeah I mean what\u2019s the end game of you knowing? Do you just want to know?", "You know I read that as you would be recruiting the brother to get a sample of your dad. My mistake. Carry on then", "I don't know about upsides other than my own peace of mind. All I have to say is my relationship with my parents isn't great but I a close to my siblings.\n\nI would have consent from my brother for his sample if he agrees so I would not be doing anything illegal.", "There\u2019s nothing illegal about she and her brother doing 23 And Me and seeing how it comes back. Or Ancestry DNA.  People do it all the time.", "It really doesn't matter if it was cheating or not.\n\nOP has a right to know if the man who keeps suggesting he is not her biological father is in fact...her biological father.\n\nEveryone deserves the truth about who they are and where they come from. It is not only the mom's truth, it applies to her child now too.", "I doubt it was a threesome, my dad acts as if she did cheat on him. But again they won't clarify if they were together or not (they may not even remember/know themselves). Whatever happened there it definitely didn't have my dad's permission/approval, it's why I think he uses it as a weapon against her and me.", "It sounds like you have put so much thought into this, and I hope y\u2019all have a great talk when you sit down together. I can see why your relationship with your parents isn\u2019t great since it sounds like they\u2019ve essentially made you a toxic punchline to their arguments. If THEIR actions would cause them to cut ties with you, is it even worth trying to keep them in your life regardless? Do they bring support, love, and joy to you? Would going LC with them hurt other, good, relationships with your other family members? It sounds like, paternity test or not, going LC or NC with them could be a good thing.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think you need to tell anyone the results if you don\u2019t want to. Don\u2019t even tell anyone you had the test done besides your little inner circle. But based on how you feel with the outcome if you do, it could be a good catalyst to move on to a more positive future.\n\nGood luck!! I\u2019ll be thinking about you. If you can, I\u2019m sure we\u2019d all like an update later to hear how you\u2019re doing.", "> I trust him with all of my heart and I know that he would never tell them any results.\n\nWhy is he so opposed to you finding out the truth about your dad? And why would he be so harsh in sharing his opinion?", "Unfortunately not. I won't go into specifics about it but he is no longer alive sadly.\n\nI also do not trust the rest of his family. Especially not the father that has been accused of being my potential bio dad. Even if he was I don't want him to know, knowing what I know about him.", "I stated in a different reply that a big part of me knowing is that I found out years after it ended that I may have had a relationship with a half sibling. He's the son of the man my dad has suggested might be my bio dad. They were family friends when we were young and we reconnected as adults and dated briefly.\n\nIm afraid I may have had a relationship with a half sibling and it scares me. Not knowing is really affecting my mental health. \n\nAgain we aren't dating anymore and I didn't know until years after it had ended. We don't have any kids or anything either but it still bothers me.\n\nHe's unfortunately passed away so I wouldn't be able to go to him about this either.", "Outside of just your peace of mind. In the off chance you do have a different father, you have a right to know family medical issues. \n\nI say that as someone who's mom was adopted and we're slowly learning hereditary medical diagnoses.", "It\u2019s possible that if you weren\u2019t your dad\u2019s child, you might get hits for a different man or his family, so you may not have to ask your sibling for a sample just yet. If you don\u2019t get any hits, which I\u2019d be very surprised since so many people have done DNA tests, then ask your brother for a sample. No one knows what you\u2019re going through and at the end of the day, you have a right to know the truth, especially since your own dad has mentioned it before and it clearly bothers you. Good luck!", "If he agrees...But you might be exposing your parents to something quite painful. This might not give you the peace of mind that you think it will...", "I could not agree more.\n\nAs someone who did not find out she was adopted until I was in my late thirties (and that was only when my mom was forced to admit it) there is nothing more selfish than parents regarding this sort of information as their \"business\" and not yours.", "Sure but they also need to think about other scenarios and if they want to know if the other possibilities. \n\n\nIf the truth that they were a product of rape, would they want to know? Sometimes dark secrets come up too and sometimes it\u2019s not all sunshine.\n\n\nWhat if they confirm they got physical with their half sibling?", "Im not sure. It was very surprising. Us arguing didn't result in really understanding other than he thought it was wrong to go behind my siblings backs.\n\nWe agreed this morning to have a calm conversation tonight after work. We're not angry any more and can have a productive conversation. We don't fight often so this kind of thing is rare for us.\n\nI'll come back and update later depending on how this conversation goes.", "If you don\u2019t want anything to do with the suspected bio dad, then why bother with the test?", "So do you think you would be better off knowing or not knowing in regards to that? Do you think hypothetical confirmation of that would be more damaging to your mental health?", "Your parents didn\u2019t handle it appropriately.", "The question of how it came to be is already been answered somewhat. My mom may have slept with someone else during my parents on again off again relationship around the time she got pregnant. This person as I stated is someone who was close to my family up until I was around 10 and my mom states all she ever did was kiss him but my dad thinks otherwise. I can't get any more info from them about this possibility.\n\nThe half sibling thing is the parti desperately want to know. We don't have any kids and we aren't in a relationship anymore and haven't been for many years. But the not knowing causes me a lot of stress and makes me feel sick. Im already in therapy and would like to know so I can put the \"What if\" aspect of all.of this to rest and start to find ways to heal from that knowledge.", "Of course, OP should consider if she is prepared to learn some hard truths.\n\nI'm only asserting that she has every right to know the truth, and those who claim otherwise (her SO and members of her family) are totally in the wrong for judging her for her desire to find out."]}
