I look nothing like my 3 siblings and during an argument with my mom a few years ago, I overheard him mention that he didnt believe I was his. Later on during an argument between the two of us he also said that he didn't even think I was his kid. He immediately back peddled and said he was just angry and didn't mean it, but it haunts me. It's been 2 years and it just lingers in the back of my mind. I mentioned doing a paternity test but he said no he wouldn't agree to it because I was his and he didn't want to. He refused to talk about it after that.\n\nI mentioned taking a paternity to my sister(24F) and she was adamant that it was a bad idea. She said it would only start arguments and that our mother would have never cheated on him. She is the spitting image of my dad, as is our younger brother and the youngest sibling we have looks like a combination of my mom and dad.\n\nI told her I wouldn't do it, however I still planned to. I was trying to figure out how I was going to get a sample from either a sibling or my dad, but  my fiance (26M) told me that I would be a huge asshole for saying I wouldn't and then doing it anyways. I argued that none of them understood what it felt like and neither did he. It blew up and he insists that all I'm doing is being dramatic and trying to hurt everyone. We went to bed angry last night, and now I'm worried that I am going to cause unnecessary drama, especially if it comes back he is my bio dad and they find out I did the test.\n\nSo would I be the asshole for not telling any of them? I know they're never going to agree to it, so I feel like it's my only option.\n\n\nETA: I realized I never mentioned how I planned to get a sample. My youngest brother is very very close to me, and I haven't asked but I believe if I do he'd be willing to give me a sample to see if we are full siblings. I was discussing that with my fiance when he said I'd be a huge asshole for going behind everyone else's back. \n\nI did not make that very clear in the post, sorry about that.", "created_utc": 1696947318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174mbrg/wibta_for_doing_a_paternity_test_behind_my/", "score": 327, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are a lot of factors that can go into something.", "NTA\n\nBut instead of paternity, why not do one of the ancestry tests? You keep your word that you won\u2019t do a paternity test. You can even mention it to your sibling to see if he wants to do with you. they even have ones that can show you medical information so you can say you want it for that. It\u2019s not as accurate as a paternity test but it might show you enough to have an answer. And it has the option that you can add it to the database and they\u2019ll contact you with any familial matches.", "NTA.\n\nThe arsehole here is a Dad that keeps claiming you are *not* his, so he must have reasons for saying it.  He planted the seed multiple times that you have heard.  How many times has he questioned it, that you didn't hear?\n\nYou can start by simply doing a DNA test on yourself, and see what the results are.  The ethnicity ancestry may not align with what you have been told of your family's heritage.  See who it connects you to - others who have done it that results may show familial connection. You may find \"relatives\" you already know or people you've never met and no idea how you are linked.  \n\nBasically, getting at it thru the \"back-door\" without asking your sibs or parents to do the test too.\n\nAfter you see and understand the results of your test, choose where to go from there.", "NTA if your brother gives you the sample to do it\n\nIt's *your* DNA.

If you are his biological daughter, that means you have to look at how and why you feel so isolated from your siblings. And your questions about why he thought you might not be his will still be unanswered.\n\nIf he\u2019s not your bio dad? This is an ENORMOUS can of worms. Are you prepared to find out your mother was raped? Or that she cheated? Or even that *none* of your siblings are your dad\u2019s kids? Just looking like him means nothing, it could be a coincidence, or someone else in his family fathered them. It\u2019s even possible your parents sought fertility treatments and you\u2019re a mix-up.\n\nOr your parents could totally shut down. Refuse to even talk about it. So now you have no answers, and caused an immense amount of damage to your relationship with them.\n\nPlease.

Your dad's comments are the real reason you feel the need to do this.  You, an adult, deserve to know from whence you came, once and for all.

How old is your brother?  If he's also an adult, of course he can consent to help you with this.\n\nLastly, beware of what you learn.

Be honest that even though it has been a while it is still really really bothering you and you need to know. \n\nI did a 23&me test last year to figure out if the man who raised me is really my dad. No one with his last name or his mother's maiden name came up in the list of possible relatives. It was a little disappointing, but at least I know for sure. It doesn't make him not my dad.

That's not a bad thing at all.", "NTA. Yes, it might have repercussions but you should know the truth and after your dad's comment, he has no right to object.

Just try and prepare for any fallout that might come.", "NTA \n\nEspecially since they bring it up to hurt you.\n\nThe only prob is you will need his dna from somewhere to do this.... Altho you could do an open ancestor tree online and see if you have matches with complete strangers.....that would tell you something", "I would ask you a series of questions first.  What do you hope to accomplish with this?  Do you think you're going to go off and find your biological father if it isn't your Dad?  Are you going to confront your Mom if that's the case?  Are you going to tell your Dad?  What happens in the future when decisions about the care of your parents need to be made - do you not want to be included because you're \"not family\"?  Will this make your Dad any  less your Dad?  \n\nWill it make anyone happy to hear that you're not his child?  Do you want your parents to divorce? Do you want your siblings, Mom, Dad, and yes, your fianc\u00e9e to always question your decisions and whether or not you're doing what you said you would do? Are you prepared to show your fianc\u00e9e your texts and emails for the rest of your life every time you write one, because your word can't be trusted?  I'm not saying that should happen, but it very well could.  \n\nAnd what happens if you ARE his child?  What, you just forget it and move on?  Your fianc\u00e9e won't forget it.  All he'll remember is you broke your word against the better judgement of literally everyone else in your family. \n\nWhat if you get caught or found out?  Even if the test reveals you ARE his daughter, your Mom will always have that lingering doubt in her head.  That you, her daughter, could have thought that about her.  Everyone involved has said they don't want to do the test.  If you try to get a sample and they find out, then what? Are you ready for a huge blowout? \n\nAnd will all of that be worth it?  \n\nI get that you have questions.  But those questions don't change your reality - you're an adult, you don't need any father other than what you've got.  The only slight way this could be, at least to me, justified is if you aren't his bio daughter, and your bio father has some important medical information you need to know.  \n\nI'm gonna go with YTA, because you really don't seem to care about any of the opinions or feelings of anyone you love in this situation.  You're just blazing forward with what you want because you want it.  You're willing to destroy everything in your life...for a hunch.  And frankly, not even that great a hunch.", "NTA.  Perhaps start with an ancestry.com type test to see if you have any matches out there.

Like others have mentioned you may have a medical requirement to know should you even need a donor or something similar. \n\nMy reason for no judgement is I'm not actually sure if it is legal to do a paternity test without consent, I am aware that it is illegal for the police to collect DNA samples without consent or warrant but I'm not sure how that would translate to civil matters such as this.

You are anywhere between 0% - 100%(twin) similar to a full sibling, although that's obviously not the average. I'm not sure of all the techniques they use. You might be able to check your X chromosome against your sisters or something I guess. And then you have to account for the likelihood that the bio dad is related to the unwitting dad. Which is also depressingly common. \n\nI would get the answer for yourself. It sounds like your dad wouldn't mind knowing the answer too.

Win-win. \n\nYou might also want to talk to your mother and ask her why your dad would say something like that.
