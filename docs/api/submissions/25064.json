Also, forcing him to cook dinner at 7 isn't going to teach him anything at all, that's a weird punishment with no lesson behind it. I'm not surw what you wanted him to learn from that.

You\u2019re believing everything OP is saying about the man. He has no defense (and I\u2019m not defending him) but you\u2019re so sure of it all. 25 is a stupid young girl? Immature? Stingy?? Where the hell is this coming from. It sounds like YOU were left for a younger woman before. Projecting.", "Didn't see any of that in her text. She said she cooked he didn't like it, so she made him cook for himself, the seven year old. You're all delusional. Downvote as much as you like.", "Yeah, all overbearing mothers are always there. Doesn't change at all the situation.", "And some kids actually have horrible moms that starve Them If They dont like their food. Im an example of this.

Thats not What she is doing tho", "This is a big ask for a working single mum. He's 8, food he likes will probably be processed crap or high effort things like a lasagne or something. Usually kids don't like food that is both healthy *and* practical because it's usually fairly boring and repetitive.

She\u2019s ascribed motives to the step mom that don\u2019t exist.

Like sure, they have a lot of butter in them, but kids need more fat than adults anyway and it's not like wunderbread is some awesome health food.

He demanded different food than what she made, so instead of just making it for him, caving to his demands, she taught him to do it himself.\n\nIt was a win-win and lose-lose. Fine.

OP also said it wasn\u2019t one biscuit a day, she sent a whole batch. So it isn\u2019t eating them alongside other healthy food, she\u2019s making it possible for him to avoid eating healthy food altogether and eat those instead. Which also makes it sound very likely that they are not sending any healthy food for his lunches on the days he is with them.", "Kids need cholesterol for brain development.", "Where does it say he demanded different food? He didn't like it and said so. There's nothing wrong with that. He might not have expressed it the way a grown up would but he's 7yrs old. Why is she cooking things she knows he doesn't like? Why not make a meal he will eat and add an extra, little bit of something different for him to try? He would eat what he likes and if he tries the new bit and doesn't like it then no harm done.", "No she is teaching him the importance of being healthy but she can also tell him it\u2019s okay to have a treat every once in a while and I call the 25 year old gf immature because she obviously has no idea what is good for the child\u2019s well being and she is obliviously going to avoid asking the mom because it\u2019s the ex husband\u2019s ex wife she thinks she doesn\u2019t have to take care of the kid because it\u2019s not her kid", "For some kids \u201cfood I don\u2019t like\u201d means \u201cnot chicken nuggets\u201d.

It\u2019s about teaching kids to be more independent and responsible, and not enable their childish whims.", "You are right, anyone thinking certain foods are inherently unhealthy goes against any science We have with nutrition and psychology around ED.", "\"Not enabling their childish whims\" so not allowing a child to express themselves. Forcing a child to eat something they don't like because the adult decided they had too. Making more work and stress for both. Yes for some kids it does mean all those things and more. It can mean the smell is making them feel sick or it looks off. I wish adults would stop expecting children to act grown when they're still learning and developing. As I have said before get the child involved. Get them to help choose the meals and help make them. Don't force them to make or eat something. It's a great way to make them never want to eat that again, speaking from experience.", "I'm passionate about biscuits, too. But yeah, they are not healthy at all lol", "No, cigarettes are actually unhealthy. The idea that foods themselves are unhealthy rather than considering a food's impact as part of your overall diet leads to a lot of weird restriction and disordered eating and bingeing for people. You're fine to eat a biscuit as long as you aren't eating several biscuits a day every day. You can have an ice cream cone for dessert as long as you don't have one after every single meal.", "Not enabling the childish whim, but listening and responding with a teaching moment rather than caving and serving."]}
