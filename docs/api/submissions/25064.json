Also, forcing him to cook dinner at 7 isn't going to teach him anything at all, that's a weird punishment with no lesson behind it. I'm not surw what you wanted him to learn from that.

If I didn\u2019t like something and complained, there were a bunch of easy options for me to choose and make myself safely (with proper supervision). I\u2019m not a great cook as an adult, but I\u2019m competent with the basics.", "In the US a biscuit is more like a softer flakier and more moist scone.", "It would be similar to a savory hand pie or pasty.", "Very well stated.", "Didn't you read what the \"tacos\" were made of? It's definitely processed food.", "An amazing mother forces her 7 year old to cook because he didn't like what she made? Yeah, I'm just gonna go with unhinged lunatic instead of amazing mother.", "How is your relationship with your son? Because I'm worried they might be turning him against you. Are you attending therapy with him? It's obvious that your ex is replacing your role as his mom with his mistress. Do you have a support system? Is he learning what is right and wrong? Why is he calling her mom? Is he being forced? He's been calling her that while you were still with your ex. Aren't you worried about him being brainwashed and accepting of affairs? You don't want him to grow up accepting this behavior so you need to undo this now and not let him normalize this behavior or he'll turn out exactly like his father. NTA\n\nAlso, please make cooking a positive experience, not as punishment.", "NTA. If she made tiny bananabread teddybears, that would be nice to include. But taccos and by that logic shitting on what you choose for him to eat. Plus you sound very reasonable concerning food. I am sorry but this will be difficult, but feel justified to stand your ground. Also considering the history of you and your ex, he is likely trying to hurt you through your son. Take care", "Agreed.", "If it's to learn to cook, that's great! But if he fails, he need to have access to good food, not be forced to eat between two meals he doesn't like.", "Just to make sure. Are you aware that healthy for adults and healthy for kids are two different things and that nutrition requirements vary by age? \nIf you feed your kid healthy and balanced food according to his age ( not yours), and are not too strict ( can cause eating disorders, especially careful about orthorexia here) then NTA.\n\nInfo: You punished him for complaining and not eating by making him cook? Or did I get this wrong? \nCooking shouldn't be a punishment, that's going to cause really unhealthy eating later on, and not liking something shouldn't be punished.", "I mean to me it looks like she\u2019s teaching him that cooking is a difficult process and you might not always like what you end up making.", "Ground beef and dough isn't junk? Yell are just mad this woman is putting in effort.", "Funny how a couple comments up every one is saying ex and gf have no say in what mom does when she has custody. Why does she get a say when dad has custody? Always wanting the cake and to eat it too. Grow up.", "Germans eat Mettbr\u00f6tchen, that's not really better? Not that I would give that to school because of food poisoning, but it's ground meat and dough based?\nOr Zwiebelkuchen.", "I would have immediately thrown them away to avoid food poisoning.", "The only person losing in this feud and grudge he hold is the child. Grow up", "Biscuits are junk food", "Here have another downvote while your tiny brain figures it out", "Yes. But I myself think that Mettbr\u00f6tchen are disgusting actually.", "No it isn't. There are very few foods that are 'unhealthy' unless you eat them in an unhealthy amount. Eating several biscuits a day like this kid's stepmom is suggesting is an unhealthy amount, but the biscuits themselves aren't 'unhealthy.'", "The closest British equivalent would be a scone.\n\nI am intrigued though. Biscuit \"dough\" implies that it is uncooked. Cooked sounds pretty tasty but raw sounds revolting!", "That's not true anymore.", "You do realize that biscuits are nothing but butter and flour right? They\u2019re sugar free cookies. Sure seems healthy for an elementary schooler.", "Oh the kids eating them every single day. Shiiiit I missed that detail.", "Exactly, not to mention the meat that's gonna spoil by room temperature.", "What do you mean? My teachers still focus on British English while AE just gets an hour of \"it exists\"."]}
