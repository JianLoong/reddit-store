He was emotionally abusive, and I have PTSD.  I will never forgive them.  I don\u2019t EVER want to go back.  I left because it almost killed me.

It gets ridiculously hot where I live, so the extra water is a necessity. He\u2019s also a BIG kid (been mistaken for a 12 year old), and I recognize that he needs a lot of food.  \n\n2) The bag of \u201ctacos\u201d was left unrefrigerated for eight hours before I found them.\n\nEdit again!: I\u2019ve learned some things from the comments under this post.\n\n1) I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do on myself.  Thank you for teaching me and being patient with me.\n\n2) There are some incredibly emotionally intelligent people here.  I literally cried when one of you offered me a hug.\n\n3) some of you have had some frankly terrible upbringings.  I\u2019ll try to learn from that too.\n\n4) I should consider my son\u2019s preferences for lunchtimes more often, especially since he wants to be involved in the cooking process.\n\nThank you, everyone!", "created_utc": 1692495881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vy34l/aita_for_not_giving_my_son_the_lunches_his/", "score": 2184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No,one thinks you're jealous of her snd your exs relationship...it's obvious you're jealous of her and your sons relationship. That's perfectly normal and you can't help how you feel.

I get wanting your kids to eat healthy, but not eating lunch at all is unhealthier than eating something that's maybe not as good for him as what you made. He isn't going to always like what you make, forcing him to eat it isn't going to make him like it or make him have healthier eating habits. Find other healthy options he DOES like. Also, forcing him to cook dinner at 7 isn't going to teach him anything at all, that's a weird punishment with no lesson behind it. I'm not surw what you wanted him to learn from that.

To this day I have extreme difficulty trying new foods because of the trauma of throwing up so frequently from food as a kid. It really isn't one of those things you can force away.", "I waa vegetarian for 20 years but still needed something more substantial than veggies and fruit on a daily basis. Why not give him sushi since he likes that (vegetarian options are good too), grilled chicken wraps, mini quiches, rice balls, lentil or chickpea crackers, protein nut bars with dark chocolate etc. It's good to have a variety of textures and offer healthier alternatives to less healthy options so he doesn't think he's missing out on junk food. If you're worried it'll get too warm get a cooler lunch bag with icepacks. It's normal in my hot country.", "Okay, so he\u2019s not eating lunch ANYWAY.

She's not only giving him a jumpstart on a essential skill, cooking, but also reinforcing that picky-ness comes with side effects. \n\nThe step mom is definitely crossing a line. It was also very rude for you to suggest that just bc this mom is doing her job, she deserved to be overlooked by her child.", "I love the variety, and honestly I think he does too.  I\u2019ll be asking him a lot more what he wants to take for lunch!", "This has been suggested a couple times, and I love it!

It's very beneficial to them.  They know that it's a household chore. Household chores are things that need to be done, but I don't use them as punishment.

The worst case was when I spend 3 days not eating anything cause every time I tried to eat something else my dad would have a go at me and tell me to eat the cold same thing I didn't like. Took 3 days and me chucking up stomach acids for my mum to fight back. I had an abusive childhood so I 100% get this.

I get allergies and dislikes, but a steady diet of chicken nuggets, pizza, fries, and sandwiches is not good for kids. \n\nFunny thing, coming from a developing country, asides from allergies and some dislikes, you can find picky eaters, but at the level you get here in the USA", "Not sure it is.  Bc no one communicated to Op to expect the food Op had no idea to look for it thus it wasn\u2019t even an option to let him have them at all.  \n\nAnd the big issue here is not communicating with Op at all about this in the first place.  Perhaps if that was done there could have been a compromise made where say Op let\u2019s him have one with lunch on friday or maybe make it smaller or with ground turkey instead. \n\nBut no one bothered to communicate to Op at all about any of this and thus the tacos had to be thrown out for multiple reasons including being out for too long.", "Yeah, you\u2019d be surprised what kinds of things kids bring back home, more so to check for notes from school or to check his homework to make sure it was correct. If checking his bag for work finds the food then ok, I would check the lunch bag for any dishes or containers that needed to be cleaned.", "I look at it as broadening their idea on food. If they never try it, they don't know if it will be good or bad. Coming from a picky eater trying not to have their child follow.", "I get what you\u2019re saying, but there are kids who have food aversions. When my son was young the school called me and told me that I should give him lunch money only on the days that they serve food that he eats. They said if it was something that he didn\u2019t like he would just not eat anything, which is very unhealthy for a growing first grader.", "Sounds like it\u2019s trying to be an empa\u00f1ada but she used biscuit dough (like from the can you pop) instead. I use that every so often to make pizza cupcakes. (Dough + sauce + toppings + cheese baked in muffin pans.) I can see how it would be appealing, but not after it sat in a bag for 8 hours unrefrigerated. I think OP has some issues here that she needs to work out. It\u2019s perfectly fine for her kid to like his dad\u2019s partner and the food she makes even if it\u2019s not what OP would personally prefer to make him.", "Look my opinion, is that the OP\u2018s response both to her son not liking dinner, and these treats being sent with him is outsized.

From one divorced mom to another\u2026 this is a hard job. We have all made decisions that if we could we would do differently. It\u2019s ok to learn as you go. You got this!\n\nYou asked for help. You asked for direction and support. You are miles ahead than you were yesterday. \n\nI would highly recommend some self discovery and education on parenting in high conflict. If I could go back 10 years ago, I would do this. Your son won\u2019t remember the forgotten snacks. He will remember any contention, baiting or parental alienation.", "NTA. She is overstepping and needs to stay in her place. Lady, you're better than me because NO ONE is gonna be called MAMA but me.", "Nta. Can you involve him in making Bento boxes? I did this with my son years ago, bcuz he was so picky. We split the box 1/2 healthy for me & 1/2 not so much for him. It's a win win for both. Then as he gets older, he will gravitate to some of the more healthy stuff. If you force all healthy stuff he's liable to chuck it all in the garbage.", "NTA - however. I would strongly urge you to reconsider the relationship with food you're creating for your son. Food has no moral value. Labeling foods as good or bad, or even as healthy or unhealthy, can have many more negative consequences than you realize. Because of course you mean well, and you want what's best for your kid! But taking away food he enjoys is just going to make him crave that food more, and making mealtime a battleground can cause a child to stop listening to their hunger cues and develop eating disorders later in life.

If not , please look into it. They are majorly crossing boundaries and that can be confusing for a kid. Is he eve ok calling her Mom or was he pressured/ manipulated into it? He needs a neutral party to provide support and to help address some of these concerns. Especially if they are things he is not comfortable bringing up to you because he is afraid you will feel bad. I can see them working towards parental alienation if you are not careful. Maybe communicate only through a court approved app so you have documentation?

Checking your 7 year old's bag to see what the heck he's got in there now when he's come home from school is totally normal for all the reasons you mentioned- maybe not so much when he's been with his dad.\n\nIMO you don't send food home with your boyfriend's kid to \"add\" to his meals when you know that not only does his mom cook,  but that her kid having a healthy diet is important to her.
