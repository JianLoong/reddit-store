{"id": 2774, "submission_id": "yzuptu", "title": "AITA for not buying my nephews food???", "selftext": "I live with my sister and her two kids who are 14 and 11. She\u2019s a single mom and works overnight. I don\u2019t have any kids myself. I try to cook home meals for the most part. However, there are some days I order burgers/Chinese food/ dessert. Well every time I go out to buy food I feel guilty if I don\u2019t buy them anything. For example, if I go get myself a burger well now I have to go get 3 burgers instead of 1, and it quickly adds up (especially because these kids EAT A LOT). All while my sister is sleeping. This has been going on for at least 6 years. Even when I do cook at home, I have to cook for at least 3 people so it adds up even if I decide to cook at home. Today was the first time I bought food for myself only. I walk in and my nephew asks me \u201cwhat\u2019s that\u201d (pointing at my burger). I told him \u201cfood\u201d, which he replied \u201cwhat food\u201d. He\u2019s old enough to know what it is, he just wanted me to tell him I had a burger for him waiting somewhere. Again, I have done this for over 6 years constantly buying myself and them food so I\u2019m tired at this point. This is the reason why I don\u2019t have kids, because I know they\u2019re expensive. My sister relies too much on me feeding her children. She makes good money so it\u2019s not a money issues it\u2019s just that she\u2019s sleeping ALL THE TIME. I know it\u2019s not the kids fault but im tired of having to spend 3x the amount if I decide to get takeout. AITA?\n\nEdit: we all split the costs for rent/utilities. She has a bedroom, I have a bedroom, and her kids have a bedroom. She pays about $80 more in rent per month but that\u2019s because her kids have the master bedroom (since it\u2019s 2 of them). But we all equally split utilities like water, gas, electricity, etc. which is why I feel I can\u2019t keep buying them food. Cost of living is expensive & to add feeding two kids to my plate is something I can no longer do.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve had this conversation with her about her feeding her kids. It gets better for a couple of weeks but then she goes days where she won\u2019t feed them and rely on me or my father to feed them.\n\nEdit Part 2: for those saying I should finish eating before I get home. I do tend to do that 50% of the time but I also like eating in my room while I watch TV. It\u2019s my home too, i pay bills so I shouldn\u2019t be forced to eat out, I should be able to enjoy eating wherever I want. I eat food in my room so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m in the kitchen or living room shoving it in their face. It\u2019s just that they see my food as I walk pass the living room to get into my room.", "created_utc": 1668917348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzuptu/aita_for_not_buying_my_nephews_food/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe she should be parenting her kids.", "NTA but of course teens want burgers if you have them. Could your sister set up a fund specifically set aside for buying the kids takeout/extra groceries? Would you be fine with it if she venmoed you, say, $100-$200 a month to cover things? If you don't come home and go out for dinner, how do the kids get fed? You are definitely NTA if you've suggested she pay for their food and she refuses but then also doesn't make sure they're fed. If she doesn't want to pay for takeout, you all should have a family meeting where she explains that uncle is a grown up and feeds himself and its not appropriate to ask him for his food.", "NTA for not buying food for your relatives.  \nYTAH for bringing it home to eat in front of them.  \nYou should have simply eaten the food before you got home.  \nIt's sort of like that time a kid got caught sneaking a piece of candy into school and the teacher asks if they have enough to share with everyone?  Is the child responsible for getting candy for the whole class? No.  Was he rude to eat candy in front of everyone? Yes.", "ESH - I totally understand where you\u2019re coming from.  But, I could never let a hungry child stay hungry.\n\nOn the other hand, your sister is neglecting no her kids.  This is her responsibility to make sure they are nourished and feed.\n\nA bad situation all around!", "YTA for bringing in a burger with nothing for them.  They are kids.  It\u2019s not their fault for wanting something to eat.  The issue is your sister, not the kids.  If you want to eat a burger, eat it at the restaurant.  Don\u2019t bring it right under their noses.  You are punishing the kids for your sisters lack of parenting.  You need a come to Jesus conversation with your sister.  She needs to be taking care of feeding her kids.  While it wouldn\u2019t kill you to help her out, it shouldn\u2019t be your primary responsibility to feed the kids.", "Info: do you help with rent/mortgage/utilities?", "NTA", "NTA - food is expensive! You could sit them all down and explain even to the kids that you won\u2019t be buying them food so that they don\u2019t have expectations. Have you considered moving out on your own?", "we both rent a home where we all split rent and utilities.", "OP shouldn't have to eat outside their home because sis isn't feeding her kids. The kids are both old enough to learn to cook basic things at home or their mother can set up GrubHub on the older one's phone if she's too lazy to shop.", "Kids don't live in their classrooms and we are talking about OP's home. They have every right to bring takeout food home and eat it in their own room. \n\nSis needs to get off her ass and make sure that there is plenty of food for her kids in the house. If she wants them to have takeout, she can set up GrubHub on the older kid's phone and pay for it herself.", "The kids aren't going hungry if they don't get take-out. Theres other food in the house.", "Great question. Yes, We all split the costs of rent/utilities.", "Sounds like it\u2019s time for you to move out when your lease is up.", "THANK YOU!! First person I see validating the fact that I shouldn\u2019t have to eat outside. This is my house too! \ud83d\ude2d", "The OP has no responsibility for bringing home food for these kids.\n\nBut from the sounds of the story, she knew that what she was doing was going to upset the kids when there was no need to do so.\n\nSo for intentionally making the kids upset was an AH move.", "NAH Kids understand that you don\u2019t eat other people\u2019s food if they have been taught that. Next time they ask for food, just say, \u201cSorry kiddo, money is tight. I only had enough for me. Why don\u2019t you go and ask your mother?\u201d\n\nAlternatively you could ask your sister for food money for the kids.", "NTA. Have you considered teaching them how to cook?  That way they can learn to make their own meals.  In our family we were taught at 12 to cook and clean dinner dishes.  It's a life skill.  If their mother does have the money to fund the cooking it may help.", "NTA. They are not your kids. Their meals are not your responsibility. She is neglecting them because she knows you'll step up. \n\nAlso, I'm curious - who babysat the kids when they were younger? Did she dump that on you or your dad or did she make arrangements to have someone take care of them?", "The 14 year old should be able to make their own burger and therefore one for their younger sibling.", "yup seems like the best route. you\u2019re being super generous and i hope they\u2019re appreciative!", "So if I understand the cost breakdown as you it laid out in your edit:\nFour people live in the house, but you pay for 50% of the utilities.\nFour people live in the house, and you personally get slightly under 1/3 of the bedroom space, but you pay nearly 50% of the rent.\nFour people live in the house but you are expected to pay for nearly 75% of the groceries and restaurant bills.\nCan you see just how skewed that is? Do you seriously think ANY non-related renter would be willing to agree to those terms with her?  Seriously, run the numbers to figure out how much less you would be paying each month if you were living with regular roommates. Then multiply that by 12 to find out how much you're losing each year. This is not just about a hamburger; this is about her expecting you to subsidize her whole lifestyle. Both in finances and in responsibilities.\n\nTwo adults live in the house: you are an (aunt/uncle) and your sister is the mother, but she is acting as if you are automatically responsible for childcare, cooking, & food costs as if you were their parent too. Is that actually what you signed up for? Because occasionally watching the kids to help your sister out is one thing, and occasionally sharing a meal is nice; spending hundreds and thousands of dollars so she can calmly sleep through her \"unpaid nanny's\" McDonald's runs is something else entirely. It might mean she has to shift her schedule so she spends more time awake in the evening & cooks for her own kids. It might mean you set an agreement that you'll pay XXX less in rent in exchange for continuing to cover their food costs. It might mean you move out and she applies for food stamps instead of just draining your bank account. There are several different options available, but you are NTA and it sounds like a change is long overdue.", "This is my thought, too. OP is getting totally screwed on this deal.  The sister should be paying at least 3/4 of all expenses.  She has 3 people.  OP is one person.  And the kids eat enough for adults at this stage.", "The kids will be upset because they don't get burgers or takeout? They'll live. Just because someone lives with you doesn't mean that you have a right to demand some of anything they have just because you want it."]}
