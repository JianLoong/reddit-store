You're running a business and at the end of the day if a particular client is making it hard for you to maintain boundaries and continue running your business the way you want, raising your prices for them or telling them to find a new provider is the only reasonable action.", "NTA\n\nIt is nice that you want to provide low care quality child care but even if you charged the friend 200 pounds it would still be an insanely low price for child care. \n\nIt seems as though you have problems enforcing boundaries - far better to just tell the woman that you can't provide child care for her rather than to play games in terms of your rates especially since it appears you asked her for a sum and then deliberately raised it.\n\nI am not saying that the price you asked was too high - in fact I think it's ridiculously low for quality child care - but the manner in which you did it isn't really a mature way to handle business.\n\nI don't know how you determine what to charge - do you know exactly what income people have?", "NTA\n\nI wish you would develop adult communication skills, however. Setting and sticking to boundaries and clear and honest communication is always preferable. It's a life skill that would serve you well.\n\nYou don't \"try\" to set boundaries.  You just do it and stick to it. It's impossible for her to force you to watch the kids after all. You just didn't like the conflict setting the boundary created.", "NTA. How would you know to set boundaries around what should be common courtesy?

It\u2019s your business. She treated you badly. She is most definitely in the wrong here.", "NTA. You didn't ruin a long-time friendship; she wasn't your friend. Her friendship with your SIL seems intact since SIL contacting you on her behalf. \n\nI would say that if you didn't want to sit for her, no is a complete sentence. Her texts at 1am were inappropriate bordering on harassment. A simple \"I'm no longer available to care for your children\" with no further explanation for her to argue about would have been sufficient.", "NTA, except to yourself. Charging what a parent can afford has to apply to well off parents too or else eventually you won't be able to keep subsidizing the parents who are less well off. Even at 200/wk you are disrespecting yourself by not requiring (a) market rate of this family and (b) a premium on top of it for being a high maintenance client and (c) not firing her as a client when she persisted in violating your boundaries repeatedly. She's mistreated you, which makes her an AH. But you also aren't giving your own work and personal life the respect each deserves. This is going to harm your relationship eventually if you don't get firmer. I understand how hard it can be to counter a low-ball offer with a fair market quote, but I hope you remind yourself that for every family that pays fair market, you have a bit more ability to help families like the one you grew up in. Holding firm on fair rates for those who have the resources is how you will get to keep contributing this service to struggling families that's meaningful to them and you.", "NTA\n\nYou never have to work for anyone you don't want to.\n\nYou should always cut ties with people who can't respect your boundaries.\n\nIf adding an annoyance fee is your way of firing a bad customer, do it.

You're well within your rights to fire a client if the relationship isn't working for you. And \u00a3200/35 = \u00a35.70/hr, which is ridiculously cheap. My only suggestion if she tries to come back is to set out in writing why you no longer wish to care for her children (the texts, showing up at your place etc).

You asked her how much she could pay and then you purposefully doubled that amount. You shouldn't ask someone how much they can pay just so you can screw them. The proper way to do it would be just tell her your price and stick to it and if you don't have a set price then make one. That is the way you do business.
