As the saying goes, \u201cdon\u2019t threaten us with a good time!\u201d", "NTA. Nope, you were right. Her crying and all was her attempt to deflect the fact that she was, in fact, being racist. And look - she is already using the money she offered you as leverage against you to make you back off, and I'll bet, even if you do apologize, she won't give you it unless you give into her wishes.", "NTA but leave the bigots at home. I'm glad your fiance is standing by you. Continue your wedding plans without the inlaws. They don't have to contribute, nor attend. This is entirely on them.", "NTA. You were blunt, but you did call it correctly.\n\nThe important thing here is how your fiance feels. If he's okay with not giving in to his parents' blackmail and letting them be absent from the wedding, then all is fine.\n\nPersonally, I suspect that MIL won't give up control that easily, apology or no apology.", "NTA - be careful accepting money from these people. If she does pay for\nsomething, I could see her getting mad at you and cancelling closer to your wedding when it\u2019s too late for you to hire/book your own thing.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling guilty for swearing you can apologize for that but DONT apologize for calling her racist when she was!", "NTA and as a bonus the garbage took itself out.", "you were right - NTA - and give back her money along with her advice.", "Well you certainly let the trash take itself out. Good for your fiance for having your back. I was going to say to NOT let them pay for ANYTHING regarding your wedding so that you have full control. Whatever you decide to do make sure you have passwords for everything from the florist to the venue so that no one but you can add or change anything.\n\nNTA", "JFC, NTA! It might be nice to have her at the wedding so the family is not fragmented from the start, but she needs to know her place too! She should be apologizing to you both!", "Honey, never feel guilty for calling a leaf a leaf or a cat a cat.  If you can do that, you shouldn't have any problem with this.  NTA\n\nAlso; Oh no, they'll not pay for half of the wedding.  What ever shall you do.  How could they...threaten you with a good time.", "NTA and your fianc\u00e9 has your back too. And educating himself on the traditional? He\u2019s a keeper.\n\nTell her you don\u2019t want her money or help. That she can attend IF she apologises and tries to be more respectful. Otherwise, uninvite her.", "NTA. The racists staying home sounds like a win. Your fiance is right, you did nothing other than stand up against racism, your MIL needed the reality check you and your fiance gave her and how important your heritage and culture is to you despite living in the US (I would argue the US is a melting pot of different cultures...Japanese included)\n\nMake sure that your wedding plans with any vendors have passwords in case MIL tries to go the sabotage route.\n\nEnjoy your wedding and don't worry about the bigots, all that matters is your fiance supports you.", "NTA. Ugh, meddling mothers in law are the absolute worst, and her soft racism is just the cherry on top. They would rather ruin their relationship with their son and DIL rather than help you two have the wedding YOU want? Fine, that\u2019s on them. They\u2019ll eventually come to regret it when they don\u2019t get to see their grandkids as much as they\u2019d like. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with people.", "NTA. You called it like it is! \nBut if you plan to have children, expect worse from her. If she\u2019s this blatantly racist to you, she may be worse to your kids", "NTA but you need to have a conversation with your fianc\u00e9 about how to handle her racism in the future (assuming that he doesn\u2019t want to go no contact with his parents for her outburst regarding the wedding).\n\nAs a couple, how will you handle her future comments about your appearance and culture? What will you do if she is racist or insulting to your parents? What about when/if you have children and she does or says racist things to them or about them?\n\nOnce you come to agreement about what your boundaries are for their involvement in the wedding (and their treatment of you etc) your husband should be the one to have the discussion with his parents.", "NTA - so she wants you to have a traditional North American Native wedding? Because - unless she is 1st Nations......", "Yeah that was an AH thing to say to her. You can never take that back and she will remember it forever\u2026 she was an AH too. So it\u2019s going to always be an issue between you now. I would apologize for calling her a bitch and continue planning your Japanese wedding.", "ESH.  You and your fianc\u00e9 are fine with taking money from a racist to pay for the wedding.  Your fianc\u00e9 should have cut her racist self off a long time ago.  You are missing that because he didn\u2019t, he is racist too.  You have both been complicit with accepting her racism.  She is for obvious reasons.", "Everybody is the asshole. You made an asshole remark about her asshole remarks. Nobody is innocent here. Maybe you both can get over it. Or not.", "YTA of course! She didn\u2019t actually do anything racist and you can\u2019t call you MIL a bitch. What is wrong with you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She probably has some self-constructed narrative where she tells herself she\u2019s a good person. You had to check her because you\u2019re marrying her son and this impacts your life.
