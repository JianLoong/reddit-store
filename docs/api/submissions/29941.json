I'm glad your fiance is standing by you. Continue your wedding plans without the inlaws. They don't have to contribute, nor attend. This is entirely on them.", "NTA. You were blunt, but you did call it correctly.\n\nThe important thing here is how your fiance feels. If he's okay with not giving in to his parents' blackmail and letting them be absent from the wedding, then all is fine.\n\nPersonally, I suspect that MIL won't give up control that easily, apology or no apology.", "NTA - be careful accepting money from these people.

Ugh, meddling mothers in law are the absolute worst, and her soft racism is just the cherry on top. They would rather ruin their relationship with their son and DIL rather than help you two have the wedding YOU want? Fine, that\u2019s on them.
