I'm glad your fiance is standing by you. Continue your wedding plans without the inlaws. They don't have to contribute, nor attend. This is entirely on them.", "NTA. You were blunt, but you did call it correctly.\n\nThe important thing here is how your fiance feels. If he's okay with not giving in to his parents' blackmail and letting them be absent from the wedding, then all is fine.\n\nPersonally, I suspect that MIL won't give up control that easily, apology or no apology.", "NTA - be careful accepting money from these people. If she does pay for\nsomething, I could see her getting mad at you and cancelling closer to your wedding when it\u2019s too late for you to hire/book your own thing.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling guilty for swearing you can apologize for that but DONT apologize for calling her racist when she was!", "NTA and as a bonus the garbage took itself out.", "you were right - NTA - and give back her money along with her advice.", "Well you certainly let the trash take itself out.

Ugh, meddling mothers in law are the absolute worst, and her soft racism is just the cherry on top. They would rather ruin their relationship with their son and DIL rather than help you two have the wedding YOU want? Fine, that\u2019s on them.

Because - unless she is 1st Nations......", "Yeah that was an AH thing to say to her. You can never take that back and she will remember it forever\u2026 she was an AH too.

I hope you have a great wedding!\n\nOne of the memories of my time living in Japan that I value the most was the time a buddy and I were at the Meiji Shrine near Harajuku, and we saw a wedding party coming through.  The bride was Japanese, and the groom was Scottish.  I could tell because while the bride and groom were in kimonos and looked amazing, the men following the groom were all in kilts.  It was such a unique sight that it's been burned in my memory ever since.", ">we should only have American weddings here, not ones that interfere with whats right and whats wrong and effect the country\n\nWTH does this even mean? seriously...like, ignoring the fact that she looks down on you for being from a different culture, i can't figure out the whole 'right' vs. 'wrong' and i REALLY don't understand the 'effecting the country' aspect. uh-oh, will something bad happen to america once you have your traditional ceremony on our shores? please let us know the date of your upcoming nuptials so we can brace ourselves for impact. WTF.\n\nNTA, obviously. good lucky dealing with looneytunes inlaws.", "NTA\n\nLooks like you got your easy out on her railroading the wedding planning.", "NTA.\n\n>She says that we live in America and we should only have American weddings here,\n\nShe wants you to have a Navajo wedding? I'm not sure they'll approve.", "NTA. But what do you mean you can't stop her when she puts her mind to it. It's your wedding. Tell her you don't want her money or help. What is she going to do?", "NTA\n\nWhat is an American wedding anyway? There are so many cultures here in the US that follow so many traditions and honor different cultures that I can't fathom what she means.\n\nI wouldn't apologize. I wouldn't want racists at my wedding.", "You should be respectful to people even if they're not to you. \n\nIt's beneficial because while other people can be fools, keeping your composure and keeping a calm word turns away more issues that are to come if you step down to their level of foolishness.\n\nI'm not saying to bend over backwards and let them walk all over you, I'm not saying you should turn the other cheek.\n\nYou can still stand your ground without being rude and cussing at your MIL.\n\nHandle yourself with class and you will be blameless.\n\nAre you wrong? In my eyes, \"kind of\" but it was the heat of the moment and you got emotional, totally understand where you're coming from, but I do think you could have handled it better. \n\nMIL is the one who was ultimately in the wrong, FIL too for supporting that foolishness.", "Be careful about marrying into a family who are clearly aligned in their putrid values. Apples fall from their trees.", "NTA, because she is. Granted, she may see herself as one (most don't), but she's very racist. One thing that got me is when you wrote \"She says that we live in America and we should only have American weddings here\", like I hate to your your MIL, but American culture literally rips off other cultures.", "NTA. MIL\u2019s just emotionally blackmailing you into doing the wedding HER way. Your fianc\u00e9\u2019s a keeper.", "Nta but 'conceived me in Japan' is maybe the wierdest way to say you're ethnically Japanese.\n\nYou're Japanese, your kids are going to be mixed.  You're going to teach your kids their culture on *both* sides of the family.", "Respond with, Ok", "American saying: Don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya.\"", "YES!!! Love this comment!!!!", "what has the fiance done wrong?\n\n> I told my fiance I wanted the ceremony to be a traditional Japanese wedding and he seemed honored by that and immediately began to get to know the wedding traditions. \n\n>Me and my fiance were shocked, and both went off on her. While he was calling her rude and disgusting...\n\n> Even though my fiance has reassured me multiple times that I've done the right thing....", "What a privileged take.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
