Her response to your complaint seems disproportionate. Standing up and telling her how you felt was not ideal, but I hardly think it qualifies you as the \u201crudest person she has ever met.\u201c", "Or you could have pointed at your BLT, and said \"Excuse me, may I have my order?\" Or even gotten up and got it yourself. YTA. I can only imagine what the other attendees thought of you.", "YTA. You weren't disrespected, you were inconvenienced. You're treating a brief delay as a personal attack.", "YTA for making it such a big deal. The items you ordered aren't even hot, what was them sitting there for 2 minutes going to do?\n\nCertainly no need to make such a big deal out of it. Learn when to not speak up.", "I feel like there is context missing here. It just reads really weird. She asked who the BLT was for and then just ignored you? That makes no sense a server never asks who the order belongs to and then just does not give it to that person.", "NTA. \n\nHonestly I would go back to the restaurant and report her to the manager for her disgusting and disrespectful comments and behavior. Thats no way to treat someone. Either she didn't hear you or didn't care. But doesn't matter, she should have asked again, or called out the name. Their was no reason for her to go a power trip like that.", "YTA- the server was attempting to multitask while serving a large group. You were incredibly rude and sound entitled.", "Grow up Yes it was a bad server but you made yourself look worse.   I would not want to include you in future events.", "As a server I find her actions appalling and she seems to be incompetent in the role. However maybe it was just a brain fart on her part.. You definitely had a right to say something but taking  a less aggressive approach would have been better. Either way she should have apologized because she was in the wrong in the first place. Instead she doubled down and was directly rude and unprofessional in her reaction.  NTA", "A group of 12-15 people and you were rude to the server. Also, you did leave tip. In a group that large, the tip is usually included in the check. \n\nTotally YTA, grumpy old man.", "NTA. There is *no* reason not to give everybody their food before taking more orders. \n\nShe knew what she was doing.", "NTA. She sounds rude & inexperienced. .", "NTA I would have complained to a manager and got her rude ass in trouble", "You did over-react. I won't call you an asshole because you already sent yourself to bed without any supper, and that seems enough punishment.", "Oof aren\u2019t you something YTA", "ESH.\n\nIt was odd for her to ask who the BLT and salad belonged to and then not bring it to you before taking orders. She should have finished the task of passing out pre-ordered food before taking orders from people who didn't pre-order. She's an AH for not doing that, as you pointed out.\n\nThat said, you're an AH for getting huffy and leaving. Your sandwich and salad were cold to begin with. They weren't going to get cold or go bad from sitting there for a few minutes longer. And it's not like you were going to be the last one eating seeing as the restaurant hadn't even made everyone's food yet.\n\nYou were an AH for the way you behaved.", "ESH, she should have just let you go. No reason to call names. You know why yta.", "NTA. I am shocked at the YTA\u2019s.", "Esh. While she was doing other things your food was getting cold. Getting food to people as quickly as possible should be the priority. So I think you had a right to be upset. I think you were fine to tell her, politely, why you were upset. However you took it easy to far by leaving. You affected everyone's lunch with your actions.", "YTA. Maybe carry a snickers bar with you if you\u2019re gonna have a meltdown over waiting an extra minute or two for some already cold food", "YTA", "YTA\n\nIf your sandwhich was right there a simple, kind...will you please hand me my food? Once you saw her start taking the other's orders would been suffecient. \n\nSome reflection on your way over reaction...if this is just you, def seek some change. If just this one time, were you wildly hungry/low blood sugar or other emotialal distress.", "Yta. Judging by your previous posts, being an ah seems to be a regular thing.", "NTA.", "YTA.\n\nShould the server have handed you your food before taking orders? Yes. It\u2019s odd she didn\u2019t. But you took a less than great serving experience and blew it up to a personal insult and stormed out. Do you usually have anger issues?", "YTA. Logically, she wanted confirmation on who's it was. Like she did with the other preorders. She didn't bring the order to the table with her already so she also took orders to be more efficient.", "YTA. The server brought the orders she could carry, took new orders, then brought out the rest of the orders (yours). This is completely normal in a restaurant that allows people to preorder. \n\nYou intended to eat with this group. Half of this group hadn't ordered food yet. You weren't in a hurry and you didn't order something that would get cold. Your behavior was unnecessarily rude.", "I'm sure it grew cold waiting for her to take other people's order , I waited tables for over 20 years she should had brought him he's food first .she is The Ass", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Were you going to eat and leave? Then why did you go in the first place? Just order in next time. I\u2019m sure everyone else at the event would be okay with that.", "NTA\n\nWhy would she asked who the food was for and then ignore OP and start serving someone else? . While leaving his food out in the open. Food gets cold pretty darn quick.\n\nThe server should hand out all the ready food before starting a new task.", "ESH", "I had stood up and took my jacket off the back of my chair and was in the process of leaving when I made my complaint to her.", "He just told her the sandwich was his. Why would she ask who the food belongs to and then not serve it to the person who loudly spoke up and claimed it?\n\nIt\u2019s not his job to take food off of the tray. What if it actually belong to another party or even at a different table or something?", "I wasn't sure the order she had left was actually mine until she finished taking everyones orders and tried to bring it to me.", "WTF everyone that preordered already had their food, except me.  After I told her it was my order, instead of bringing it to me, she immediately started taking other people's for over 5 minutes before she touched my food.", "I agree.  In OP's place after being skipped like that I would most likely just quietly leave, abandon the order and move on to somewhere else.", "After I claimed my order she should have brought it to me then instead of taking orders for 5 minutes  and blowing me off.", "Multitasking includes prioritizing. You always prioritize food over orders. Even from a selfish standpoint, she should\u2019ve offloaded the food in order to check that task off in her mind.", "I told her it was my food and instead of serving me she started taking other people's orders.  Is there a reason I shouldn't expect a server who asked whose food is this to bring it to me instead of blowing me off and taking orders from the other guests.", "ESH,  Ya, not understanding why nobody else is understanding how unprofessional and bad at her job the server was.  If that was her worst customer, she is definitely new.  He was a minor ass but she failed at managing the table and a disgruntled customer.", "This! Almost deliberate ! I have interacted with servers like this who have no manners. Mainly in the USA.", "Her food was already cold I imagine if it was a BLT, and I imagine there may have been a reason on the servers part if op is acting like this on Reddit over waiting two minutes for their BLT.", "I think you overreacted by leaving; but again, that is nowhere close to being the rudest person that she has ever met.", "You said she asked and you told her it was yours. How was that confusing?", "I mean I can understand it probably felt a little odd. But I wouldn't have thrown a fit over it. She was going to give you your food in a second anyway. It's not like it was going to get cold in the time it took to get the orders. And if you don't care about all that, then I really do agree with the others in that this likely made you look very bad in front of these other people.", "Then you politely say \u2018would you pass me my order first? Thanks\u2019\n\nNo need to be loud, she probably made you wait cause you\u2019re talking to her like she\u2019s dumb (loud and indignant) when she was obviously asking who to pass it to.\n\nYTA - you genuinely act like you\u2019re the queen and everyone should remember it, it\u2019s embarrassing. The server was totally rude, but you kinda had it coming the way you started out.", "On the bright side, you\u2019re unlikely to be invited out with these people again.", "Oh no! You had to wait 5 minutes!?! \n\n\n\nYTA.", "It wasn\u2019t even a hot meal. YTA", "Why didn\u2019t you just take the order from the tray?", "YTA you sound extremely entitled", "Op wasn't skipped, they just had to wait 5 minutes.", "Yes she should've but she didn't \"blow you off\" she just didn't prioritize you. I highly doubt she came out of the kitchen and thought \"oh that fucker? I'm gonna make him WAIT\". She probably just wanted to get the orders in. Life doesn't need to be this intense homie and not everyone is out to get you", "Were you on the other side of the table?", "Why do you continue to argue with people? YTA. Just stop", "The other customers were also vying for her attention, they were closer to her and more people. She was in a no win situation as whoever she gave attention to last would be annoyed. This was an annoyance nothing more, your response was over the top", "It was a good 5 minutes or more.  Why is she asking whose food it was and not bringing it to me and instead immediately began taking other guests orders?", "Maybe she didn't like the way I looked.  First time I had ever had this server.  Thanks for the speculation that there \"may have been a reason\" for the server dissing me like this.", "Yeah, something tells me that dramatically storming off after waiting 5 minutes was not the first asshole thing op did that day.", "I imagine we're having a rather one sided and skewed version of what the OP said. For the server to say this in response, I would have thought the OP was.... less than civil as they left.", "She said who ordered the BLT and salad,  I said it was mine and she didnt bring it to me, she started taking orders, I was confused initially about whether it was my order when she didn't bring it to me when I said it was mine.", "It was a cold sandwich and a salad. OP is literally just mad they had to wait 5 minutes.", "That\u2019s not true. It takes 10 seconds to give the guy his sandwich and then she can start taking orders. It makes no sense to have one guy waiting and salivating over his sandwich while she\u2019s taking half a dozen other orders.", "Have you considered that maybe they weren't trying to slight you? Maybe something else was going on here?", "Then she should\u2019ve said \u201cI\u2019m gonna send the sandwich back.\u201c\n\nWhen you ask who the entr\u00e9e belongs to, they are naturally going to expect you to give it to them. It\u2019s terrible communication on her end.", "It is certainly one sided; but that is the nature of this sub.", "I don't get it. I'd just wait. It's really not that bad. OP was rude.", "So her order of operations was a little off, doesn\u2019t warrant acting like a child and making a scene over. \ud83d\ude44", "Indeed. But I think you can read between the lines of this one quite clearly.", "No, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s a bizarre situation where the waitress announces the entr\u00e9e and then doesn\u2019t give it to the diner:  \n\nWaitress:  \u201c Who had the BLT and salad?\nCustomer: \u201cI did.\u201d\nWaitress:  \u201cGood for you! Alright, anyone else who  hasn\u2019t ordered yet? Ok, you got the portobello with onion rings? Great.  Next?  Ok, turkey sam on rye\u2026.great! Who else?\u201d"]}
