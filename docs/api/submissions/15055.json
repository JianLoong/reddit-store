A woman working two jobs and taking care of a baby while her bf is talking to people on tinder. Legit not real.", "YTA for doing his job in the first place. Why are you letting him use you like that? He gets to sleep in and talks to girls on Tinder while you\u2019re doing 2 jobs and looking after a 2 year old. You\u2019re better off on your own with your two year old.", "WTF?  He isn\u2019t doing his own job but it\u2019s your fault that he lost his job?    \n\n\nYou need therapy.  Why do You think it\u2019s your responsibility to do his job?  You\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t lose your job since your were splitting effort between two responsibilities and trying to watch a child. Get rid of the loser Boyfriend.  He\u2019s more effort than help.", "I\u2019m not going to pass internet judgment on you.\n\nBut please consider this in place of said judgment:\n-You\u2019re brilliant \n-You\u2019re extremely hardworking \n-You\u2019re deserving of true love & respect \n-You\u2019re beautiful \nAnd YOU DESERVE BETTER!\n\nTime to reevaluate your relationship with that bloak because what you described isn\u2019t a loving, respectful relationship. All kinds of \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA - for getting him fired, but YTA for letting him get away with employment fraud. Get the heck out of the relationship with your kid. If someone in the company finds out, you'd be lucky with getting fired with no severance. Depending on the company, if they want to drop the hammer and basically ruin your lives, they probably will.", "Get rid of him!  You deserve way better!   Lose some weight!  Like the weight of your ungrateful lazy lying boyfriend.  Sorry you have a baby with him but at least there is not a ring on it yet!  Get out and fast!!!   And NEVER do anything like this again for any man!   \n\nNTA", "This is such an all-around mess of bad decisions I don't know where to start. You are both assholes in your own right. Get your fucking shit together and stop worrying about who's fault it is.", "Or you could break up with him and kick him out/ move out and he would be forced to work and pay child support. Whatever you do, DO NOT pay his share of the bills. He's a deadbeat loser and you are a fool for a) putting up with him and enabling this behavior b) doing his job, your job and the parenting.", "This has to be fake right? It\u2019s very sus.", "Girl, you aren\u2019t wrong! I would have refused to ever even do the job for him. Who puts their spouse under the pressure of doing their job and your job, and then piles on the most difficult job PARENTHOOD! Being a Mom, and raising my toddler (16 months) is hard enough (I\u2019m a SAHM) you are awesome for doing the jobs and taking care of your 2 year old. I give you major props! \n\nIf you need a friend or someone to talk to, you can message me if you like.", "ESH. Yikes, what a mess you\u2019ve both created for yourselves. Time for some serious reflection and action towards progress.", "And letting this guy *sleep in* while she's doing two jobs and caring for a toddler!", "Well, technically she was only defrauding herself -- the business was paying for services rendered, she made sure the work they were paying for got done, just let them pay someone else for the work she was doing.\n\nI agree YTA to yourself for ever letting yourself be used like this, OP. Kick him out and put an end to this. NTA for stopping, just for allowing it in the first place.", "There are so many other things he could have been doing. Running the house and errands while you worked 2 jobs or been right there with you learning how to do his job so he could take over. He could have been out looking for jobs he was qualified for. Once you realized his job was hard why did you just keep doing it and let him sleep all day. I think your bf is an AH but YTA to yourself and your child for not taking steps to rectify this situation. And that\u2019s before I even judge on the fraud thing. \n\nHe has someone work a full time job for him, take care of his kid and your house while living for free sleeping all day and talking to other women. You have to get this guy out of your life. I normally think people jump to the leave him/her comment to quickly. But it\u2019s absolutely warranted here.", "Seriously.  What does he bring to the table?  Gets her to lie and cheat for him, overwork herself with two jobs and a baby, he sleeps in, gets on Tinder to cheat, then blames her and says now it's on her to pay the bills, which she was already doing anyway.  Get rid of him.", "Good old I have no self worth and make terrible decisions iata", "I\u2019m personally insulted by the poor quality of OP\u2019s troll.", "I love this response.\n\nSo many times on AITA\u2026. It is simply people who cannot stand up for themselves.    And while they are certainly not the asshole in that situation\u2026 They are being an asshole to themselves\u2026 For putting up with the ridiculousness.\n\nI like your style kitten 1412\u2026 Colorectal surgeon!", "Yep. Ditching the boyfriend is one less dependant for her to support.", "Victim blaming at its best.", "The empty shampoo bottle in the corner of the shower brings more value to the home than this guy.", "Wow wtf. What kind of reasoning is \"asshole for even getting into this situation\"? Victim blaming at its finest in this whole thread.", "If he\u2019s already shown he\u2019s a gaslighter then how would confronting him about her \u201csuspecting something was up\u201d go? These people never admit to it, her snooping through his phone is the least of their problems.", "I can\u2019t even get to the possible employment issues because I would LOSE IT if someone who wasn\u2019t also working/ill/had some other issue or commitment was SLEEPING while I worked two jobs and cared for a toddler alone. What in the \u201cexcuse the hell out of you?!\u201d", "I always hear about situations like this but goddamn it's really insane what some people have normalized as a \"normal\" relationship. This whole situation is so gross. Kick him to the curb, he's a fucking leech not a human being", "No, I'm talking about the fact that OP was basically using her partners SSN to work, which has implications between OP and the government...", "True. This whole thread is full of victim blaming.", "while that's true, if they find out, they hold a lot of power to ruin both their lives. If OP is lucky it ends with just getting fired with maybe no severence and no reference.", "How do you know the employer would screw her?", "I wanna say that people are not this stupid.", "Commented after you\u2026 But you\u2019re absolutely correct", "How is he going to prove it? By saying \u201cduh I\u2019m too dumb to work and I can demonstrate how dumb I am?\u201d", "Yeah, regardless of the impact it has on her workplace, this has got to be a crime that falls somewhere under the criminal headings of \"tax evasion\" or \"identity theft\", nevermind it's probably also some sort of defrauding of her employer... like OP should probably remove this post if she's not shitting us, because this all seems like the type of thing that could get her jailtime.\n\nOP who's going to look after your two year old if you get arrested for fraud? Not fucking this man.", "How is this crime/fraud territory? She is paid for a job to do - she does the job apparently well enough to keep hers. Apparently she does his job well enough to keep his.", "I'm sure if the employer is tipped off, and tries to dig deeper, they can find evidence if they know to look.", "Not really, he was paid to do a job, the work was being done.", "That\u2019s an excellent point. And what happens if he tries to file an unemployment claim? They have the legal right to contact his former employer. How\u2019s that gonna go, \u201cOh yeah, my girlfriend impersonated me and when they found out I couldn\u2019t actually do the job, they fired me. For cause.\u201d Um, guy sitting behind desk stamps his paperwork with a big \u201cCLAIM DENIED\u201d.", "He cheated on you while leaving you to deal alone with the stress that your joint decision to defraud your employer was causing?", "Not really, OP using her partner's SSN to work, that has implications legally beyond just between OP and her employer.", "I suppose alot of it would come down to what type of work they were doing and the company itself. Either way if he was being paid to fo a job and the work was done they arnt really stealing are they? If they are dealing with sensitive information then yes i can see it being a problem but if its something more basic i doubt anyone would care"]}
