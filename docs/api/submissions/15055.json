I'm going to say YTA and by that I don't mean you're an asshole to him, I mean you created this situation (by doing his job in the first place) despite it being against your best interests?

You're working one job for you and one for him.\r  \n\r  \nThen he screams at you for effectively quitting the second job.\r  \n\r  \nGiven the level of lying and manipulation, why would you be surprised to find that he's also lying about being faithful?\r  \n\r  \nChoose a new boyfriend who doesn't lie and who doesn't require you to go along with his lies.", "NTA what does this dude add to your life? Why are you with him?", "YTA for even putting yourself in this situation", "What does this man bring to the table? Literally,  what?  You can't rationalize doing his job , your job,  parenting  and letting him fuck around.  Its just wildly unreasonable.   Kick him out.  Now.  Yesterday.  As soon as possible,  he is a drain", "YTA for getting into this situation. Is he the only man in your town? Even if so you\u2019re better off without him.", "ESH. Him for everything, you for enabling him and doing his job for him. \n\nDo you really need 2 kids to raise? Because you've got an adult male toddler and a real actual toddler on your hands. \n\nHe's a gaslighting lazy lying cheating fraudster who now feels like he's won the jackpot - he's unemployed so doesn't have to work, he's managed to make you feel guilty so you'll pay for everything while he likely pretends to look for work, and he's not going to be getting up any earlier to help care for the child, either. What exactly is he bringing to this relationship? Would your life be harder or easier if he wasn't there? \n\nYou've got a lot of thinking to do and maybe talking to a counselor might be a good idea. Probably for both of you, but for you by yourself for surel.", "ESH but your BF is worse - you both worked together to commit fraud against your employer which is what has created that situation. He cheated on you while leaving you to deal alone with the stress that your joint decision to defraud your employer was causing, so while you maybe should have told him you would no longer be doing the job for him so he had the opportunity to at least try to keep his job (although I imagine he would have struggled), he is definitely still worse. \n\nYou should be cautious with your next move though; if he decides he has nothing else to lose and tells your employer what happened you would probably also lose your job...", "NTA - You shouldn't have been doing his job at all.  The job wouldn't be the worst I would do - if you cheat, i leave.  Do you really want someone who doesn't care about helping out with your child?  Working?", "NTA, but please put yourself and your child first. Your bf sounds like a loser who doesn't prioritize either one of you. And at his age, he's not gonna get any better.", "I'm going to go with ESH. Not for anything you did to your boyfriend (who sucks more and who you should dump), but you were choosing to actively participate in defrauding your employer with him.", "Nta, you covered for him and he took advantage, time to dump him on the curb before he causes you any more issues.\n\nHe didn't pay you for the work you did for him. If the company finds out they may also jeopardize your job.", "ESH  You faked his resume. Then you did his work.\n\nHe didn't work or care for your 2 yo.   He didn't wake up until 10:30. He's on dating apps and talking to other girls.\n\nY'all are a mess, both of you.  \nValue yourself more, get rid of this guy and take him to court for child support.", "What the hell did I just read\n\nEDIT for judgement. ESH. You\u2019re TA for letting this situation happen in the first place. Your boyfriend is TA for like\u2026literally everything. Why are you with him? Why did you have a child with him? The child is the only one who is not TA by the way.", "NTA - but you should not have let it go that far.  You should not have been doing his job and it should not have taken Tinder to cause you to stop doing it. \n\nAnd, the real question - why are you still a family?", "NTA.  No way are you responsible for making him lose his job!!  He himself is the one responsible for loosing his job!  Sounds like he was too lazy and uninterested in trying to keeping the job. It doesn't matter if he was underqualified the answer to that is fake it til you make it.  If he was truly interested he would have made the effort to learn how to do his job.  But your not his momma and he's plenty old enough to get himself up in the morning and log in and do his own job.  As to him saying it's YOUR responsibility to pay the bills I'd take him up on that by kicking his lazy, selfish butt to the curb.  He want's to be lazy and act single he CAN be lazy, single, jobless while living somewhere else!!!", "YTA.  You know you did amazingly WRONG in this situation.  It's all on you for creating this nightmare. Congratulations.  Now you get to reap what you sowed.", "Man ESH, and big time. You for enabling him, and him for lying on his resume to a degree that he couldn\u2019t even do his job PLUS the fact he was cheating on you.", "Look up codependency...that is you. Time for you to work on that.\nHis problems are not your problems", "ESH. Your boyfriend for obvious reasons (also, he\u2019s cheating on you - why is he not an ex?) and you for enabling him and jeopardizing your own career in the process.", "ESH. Him for trying to cheat and slacking at his job, and you for committing employment fraud and not kicking his butt to the curb long ago! Why you chose to have a kid with this dude is beyond me.", "What are you doing?!?!? Get out of this relationship because YTA to yourself.", "Info: so he is cheating, not working and not parenting. What is his contribution to the family?", "Esh \n\nYou for committing fraud AND for doing 2 jobs at once. Wtf did you do that to yourself? Not only that you're *still* with him despite the cheating? Girl what\n\nHim in general for everything", "ESH.  You're not TA for leaving him to do his own work.  Obviously a grown man should take responsiblity for his own job and face the consequences of his own actions.  You're TA for snooping through his phone when you suspected something was up instead of just confronting him about it and acting accordingly.\n\nQuit letting him gashlight you.  He's the one screwing over your family, and you're going to be much better off cutting him loose so that you can raise your two year old without the additional burden of parenting a 29 year old child.  You're being TA to yourself and your child by enabling this nonsense.", "NTA. The question here is: why he is your husband? You need to do his Job, you.need to take care of your toddler, and???? Take your Child, and get out of.there ASAP. You can be better alone.", "NTA. Plus kick his a\\*\\* out. Sheesh, what an AH.", "NTA. I'm failing to see what about this lying, (maybe cheating), lazy person does to enhance your life or that of your child.", "NTA\n\nHe's awful for being lazy, letting you work 2 jobs and take care of your child and also cheating (or at least having the intention to).\n\nAssisting him with \"tricking\" your employer was a poor decision on your part, but I suppose that's in hindsight now.\n\nHe's being childish because he's been found out. HE is responsible for losing his job. HE is the one who cheated in the relationship. This is all his doing.\n\nI don't know your living/housing situation but I'd be moving out/kicking him out asap.", "NTA he wasn't taking accountability for himself", "Wtf. There is no world in which you\u2019d be to blame for this. NTA", "NTA, get yourself and your child away from this abusive man.\n\nSeriously, he\u2019s intentionally manipulating and using you. I know this is cliche, but he\u2019s literally made you his parent. You even finance him! What does he bring to the table? \n\nHe manipulated you into working two jobs, under false pretenses (if they discovered what you were doing you could have been fired as well), and still made it your fault. It will only get worse. \n\nDo you want to teach your child that this is how their future love should treat them?", "NTA. He is gaslighting you. You covered for him and he took advantage on you. Don't do this again because this is illegal.", "NTA. Plus kick his a\\*\\* out. Sheesh, what an AH.", "NTA. BF lied to get a job and got fired. You were doing his job while he's sleeping in and not helping with the kid. Add to that on tender and caught. Then thinks it's all your fault. Now thinks you're going to support him. You haven't listed one good thing about him or hinted there are any. RUN!!", "NTA.  You didn't cause him to lose his job. He did that himself.  You should have never tried to \"do his job\" for him.  He was taking serious advantage of you.\n\nBut really, red flags, you have two children, not one.  And the older one is cheating on you.  And guilt tripping you.
