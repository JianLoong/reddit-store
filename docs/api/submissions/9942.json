I don't think she was arrested, but this was 25 years ago, so my memory might be foggy.\n\nThe dog lived a long life with her proper owners after that. The crazy lady moved away about a year after the incident. I can't blame her, the whole neighborhood hated her after that.", "That was my first thought. Especially if it\u2019s one of those \u201cdesigner\u201d breeds. They can go for *a lot* of money, and if this so-called friend just lost their job, maybe they figured they could make some quick cash.\n\nActually, now that I think about it\u2026.I wonder if OP\u2019s dog is fixed or not? The \u201cfriend\u201d could have possibly taken OP\u2019s dog out to impregnate another dog and collect a stud fee (I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called?). If he\u2019s a pure bred (or at least looks it) there\u2019s a market for that.", "Get a doorbell camera", "So glad your dog is home safe and sound.", "Basically the police came and took the dog, who went home. Dog thief sold her house a year or so later and moved. The saga became a neighborhood legend.", "Better tactic would be go steal the dog after the moving truck leaves, then bring to new house.", "The dog was taken without asking the owner and was returned 2 days after taking the dog again without the owners permission.", "Wicked easy. I lived in a 3-BR condo and had a kind of revolving door of roommates/roommates\u2019 significant others, for a while. And it was in *Florida.* so I changed the locks a few times. Just buy the kit at Home Depot or wherever. Easy peasie.", "Look at it this way. She saved you a dinner and a bottle of whiskey. NTA", "NTA! Omg OP! I'm so glad your dog is back. I would never trust that friend again. If anyone took my dog anywhere that wasn't authorized by me I would be livid. It's a life and a family member, not a cute accessory to go have spontaneous fun with. My dog is an angel until he's on a leash around other dogs, a friend might not know the proper ways to redirect him, which could cause a dog fight(he's all talk, so he would be the one getting hurt). He also starts limping after long hikes if you don't force him to slow down, which someone wouldn't know unless they've hiked with him before. Bottom line is that your friend doesn't know your dog the way you do, so they shouldn't be doing unfamiliar things with them! So glad your dog is back to you.", "NTA. Kick her sorry but out of your life. She STOLE your dog. She never ASKED to take your dog upstate, she took him way longer than she said.  What if he would have gotten injured or lost?  Don\u2019t look at her - \u201cshe just lost her job\u201d. Waaah. Poor her. \n\nDump her like your hands were on fire. If she has keys to your place change them IMMEDIATELY. Take her off ALL your social media.", "NTA", "NTA! No way would I still be friends with someone that would be so thoughtless! I guess you were leaving your dog with one of those people that say \u201cit\u2019s just a dog\u201d to cover horrible behavior.  So, even if it\u2019s \u201cjust a dog\u201d, she kept your \u201cproperty\u201d past the time you \u201cloaned\u201d it to her.  Ugh.  Drop her.", "\u201cWas I the one who fired you?\u201d \n\nFirst of all, how dare you? I\u2019m literally crying. Sir, I am deceased. Dead I say! Absolutely NTA.", "I would have called the police on my friends immediately I do not care. Do not take my dog out of my home without permission cause that\u2019s theft. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t trust her. I strongly suggest you change the locks.", "Dognapping.\n\nNTA. That woman took your dog, without telling you where they were going, and did not return him for what sounds like days. How is that not a big deal? She would no longer be my friend. And get your dog chipped, and perhaps put a GPS tracker on his collar, because this gives me all kinds of bad vibes.", "She what?! That is so out of line. If she had done that to a child, it would be considered assault. This is not okay, and I would safeguard myself and my dog against this person.", "Yes - literally, changing its look to hide the identity.\n\nYWNBTA to report this to the police, to have it on file.  The 'friend' is exhibiting extreme behavior at this time. Both you and the dog may need a bit of backup right now.\n\nYour nearest animal shelter probably offers microchipping for a small fee, which will help to establish your connection and rights to the pet.  The animal control office in your area may also have some insight into the incident you have just experienced.", "Or she realized OP would go nuclear when she mentioned kidnapping.", "Add a GPS tracker to his collar if you can. That way if she does manage to take him again somehow, you will know where they are.", "NTA and never let this person be alone with your animal again. That's very disrespectful to you.", "My dogs are my family you don\u2019t take them without permission NTA & dump the friend treating your pets so nonchalantly", "NTA, and i agree with others that say it sounds like she lost your dog and was buying time. She probably got him groomed to hide his condition and he would be happy to see you i assume. Either that or she really was trying to steal him, but i feel him being lost or something similar would make more sense.", "I would have called the cops on her. Cut her out of your life. Tell all your friends what she did. Block her on everything. microchip your dog and get a GPS tracker. get security cameras in case she comes to your house. if there is any chance she has keyto your house change your locks.", "NTA. So e people are jerks. You'll know better next time.", "op=NTA\n\nbut I wouldn't trust her ever again.  And don't let her stay again at your home, with a lost job she might try to establish tenancy(or ask to move in)", "Holy poo, I'm a pet sitter and THIS IS MY NIGHTMARE FUEL", "Just reading this brought up all sorts of anxiety and anger. \n\nNTA, I'm glad your puppy is back home safe.\n\nShe is not your friend.", "You sound very unhinged about your fired acting like a crackhead with your dog", "Dognapping* the law sees them as property, sure, but we can use the preferred terminology here.", "Or selling it.", "Well you can't blame the neighborhood for hating her. She literally stole the dog and tried to cover it up by giving it a haircut. People generally don't like living next to brazen thieves.", "NTA -- I'd actual lose my mind is someone did this, she's lucky the police weren't involved or youndidnt drive up and get him yourself.", "NTA\n\nGood lord I'd be losing my damn mind. 'I lost my job' is not a f\\*cking excuse, she can't take your dog on a cross-state vacation and then delay bringing it back.\n\nDump this friend now.", "NTA. Change your locks", "Nta\u2026. My dog is my third child yes I\u2019m one of those people in my eyes she  kidnapped the dog I\u2019d end the friendship", "Nta. Has your dog been neutered? Is your dog male and a pure breed? I ask because I am wondering if she is taking your dog to stud and making money?", "And change the locks.", "I didn't even think of that! Way worse than stolen", "Do...you really think people don't recognize their own dogs? Lol. Someone could paint my dog plaid and I'd still recognize her anywhere.", "I would have gone medieval."]}
