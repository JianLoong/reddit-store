While putting in the last few ingredients, I realized I was missing Chipotle peppers and fritos, two things that I love putting in my chilli.\n\n Since there's a grocery store cross the street from my neighborhood (GPS says 0.2miles from my house, literally a one minute drive) I decided to leave the chilli on the stove at the lowest heat and go and grab the missing ingredients quickly. I was back home within 5 minutes of leaving.\n\nWhen I left, one of my roommates was at home and I told him I was running to the store for a second and that I had chili simmering on the stove. My other roommate was gone all day with his girlfriend. \n\nWhen I get back home I'm immediately barraged at the door by my other roommate's girlfriend, who arrived just a minute before me, screaming  about how ridiculous it was of me to leave the stove on unattended. I tried calmly explaining to her that I left right before she got there, and was only gone for 5 minutes. I also calmly explained that I was simmering POUNDS of chili, and that with how much food there was in the wok, and how low the heat was, it would have taken a day and a half before it dried out and became a fire hazard. She didn't care one bit and still yelled at me like a pissed off mother reprimanding a child. \n\nI expressed that I wasn't OK with her yelling at me, especially in my house, and making demands as if she owned the place. Immediately she deflected and made it about how her dog COULD have been there by himself and COULD have been hurt if the house caught on fire (her dog wasn't there, also my house isn't a daycare center for her dog).\n\nI told her I've made chili dozens of times and I've always left it on simmer unattended for hours and hours at a time, mixing it occasionally, and I knew what I was doing. I also made a point that my pet parrot WAS at home while I left to the store, and that if I thought leaving chili on simmer for a few minutes would be a fire hazard, I wouldn't have done that. Birds are extremely sensitive to fumes and smoke (so much that coal miners would bring them into mines to give ample warning if there were toxins in the air)\n\nI told her I would understand her being upset if I did this at her house without permission , but I did this at mine. I also said that it would be different if I left with the stove on max, like if I were searing a steak or something; but this is chili, one of the few foods you leave to cook all day on the lowest heat possible. \n\nLong story short, she blows up and throws a tantrum while saying some less than nice things to me. The next day I overhear her on the phone with my roomate basically talking shit about how I can't take accountability for anything, I'm an asshole, ect.\n\nDo people actually stand around in the kitchen for 6 hours staring at chili while it simmers?

If no one had been there, I would have understood maybe being a bit concerned. But a) you told your roommate so that they were aware b) she doesn't even live there!! She has no right to scream at you about the things you do in your own home. Even if she had a legitimate reason to be up upset, screaming at you was not ok. She sounds either totally unhinged or stewing in hatred for you for something that has nothing to do with this current situation. I suppose it could be both.", "NTA. It's not her house and while it was slightly more dangerous to leave the house with it cooking than just being around the house (but not watching it) while it was cooking, you have experience doing this and were only gone a few minutes.\n\nThat said... two people are going to eat two gallons of chili in one week? Are you sure that's wise?", "I mean yes I get your point but really, for them to dry out isn\u2019t really the only hazard. I mean imagine if the dog had somehow jumped up and hit it, knocking it off. Then the dogs injuries would\u2019ve been on you. It\u2019s not just about looking at a specific situation in the past and seeing that nothing went wrong, it\u2019s seeing that something could\u2019ve easily gone wrong. The thing that dose annoys me is that there was someone else in the house which you could\u2019ve asked to go get them for a favour. I get that it was low risk but things can be so unpredictable sometimes. \n\nBut then, A: it was in your house, B instead of choosing to resolve she lights the flame even more by talking shit ( no pun intended with flame) and C the roommate was also there.\n\nNta and the roommate it ah due to her reaction", "ESH. Her for berating you in your own home, and you for leaving the house with the stove on. What if you'd gotten in an accident? There are too many possibilities for a fire.", "Perhaps this is an emotionally charged response and an inability to form an unbiased opinion, but as someone who lost their brother in a house fire that the fire department + police determined took around 2 minutes maximum, from ignition to spreading throughout the first floor of the house and causing death, which happened because the stove was left on but unattended WITH two people in the house, you are wholeheartedly TA IMO.\n\nI didn't even bother reading the rest of the post because, honestly, I don't care what your reasoning or justification for it was. You never know what could happen within those few minutes. Fires can start unexpectedly and cause so much damage in such a short space of time. I don't think anyone could truly appreciate how incredibly destructive and inescapable a well-ignited fire is unless they've experienced it first or second-hand. \n\nIs it really so difficult and so far out of your way to just turn the stove off whilst you're out and turn it back on when you return? Is the few extra minutes of convenient cooking-time worth the potential risk?", "Question: I understand the chipotle peppers, but do you put the Fritos in the chili while it cooks or as a crunchy topping when you dish it up to eat it?\nI feel like adding Fritos during the cooking process is a weird move", "I worked with someone whose kitchen was torched because he went into another room for a couple of minutes to help his kid with something. 5 figures for repairs.  Fires start unexpectedly and spread quickly, never mind the smoke damage.  Open flames are like small children in baths. Never leave them unattended. It's a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nPlus, you may own the house, but other people live there. And if they didn't, your house goes up, and you have neighbors you could affect. YTA.", "NTA, your house, you can do what you want.", "NTA. It's your home. Get the bad vibes outta there.", "NTA someone was in the house", "NTA she overstepped in a big way", "Nta bc there was a person there if a fire *did* happen.", "NTA- If your roommate wasn't home, I'd be siding with the gf as it's just plain unsafe to leave a stove running unattended. But it was attended by the roommate who was home, so the problem is resolved. Even if you're not hovering over the pot like a mall cop looking for shoplifters, just being around and available is enough if it's truly taking hours to cook. Like another comment said, that's what a slow cooker is for, after all.", "NTA\n\nProfessional firefighter here. You\u2019re right, she\u2019s wrong. Simmering chili will be fine. \n\nMost of the fires I am dispatched on are for food on the stove. They generally produce a ton of smoke and very little fire. Sometimes they burn up the cabinets but the smoke will alert everyone and usually with enough time to prevent anything more than a nasty lingering smell. \n\nDon\u2019t take this as permission to do this more often though. There\u2019s zero percent chance you were gone for five minutes. Even if the store was in your next door neighbors apartment. Time escapes us when we are busy. Be careful. \n\nShe\u2019s still wrong tho", "NTA.  She\u2019s an idiot.  I\u2019ll put a pot of chili on to simmer and then go to the movies or something.", "Agreed. The only time I leave the house for an extended period of time while cooking is either my pellet smoker or my crock pot which are pretty darn safe", "Hahaha. I make my chili with lean ground turkey and mainly ingredients from my garden. It's extremely low in fat and super high in protein. My girlfriend and I are on a diet and also work out a lot. It has really good macros. I appreciate the concern though, and to be fair, my farts are horrendous right now.", "They can\u2019t have the same thing for lunch every day? I\u2019m a big fan of making a lot of something and not having to cook something else to take for lunch every day.", "The dog that doesn\u2019t live there and wasn\u2019t even there?\n\nNot to mention, there was someone else home who knew about it. Do you sit in your kitchen and stare at your stove every second your stove is on?", "Her dog wasn't there, read carefully", "If I had gotten in an accident, my roommate, who was home and was told about the chili would have noticed. I told him I would be back in 5 and to keep an eye on it.", "By this logic, chili should be banned, and so should slow cookers. Because nobody in their right mind is going to stand right in front of the stove for 6 hours watching it cook. Either way, I'm sorry for your loss.", "I understand your reasoning as my ex fiance died in a fire as well. Unfortunately, most of the respondents here only want to hear NTA.", "I crush them up and put them as a topping as I eat lol, I'm not a psycho.", "So if you\u02bbre cooking a recipe that takes hours of simmering you never leave the kitchen?\n\nI have an electric stove and I routinely leave the stove on and go into another room.", "Okay, but...\n\nYou: I make my chili with lean ground turkey and mainly ingredients from my garden. It's extremely low in fat and super high in protein. \n\nAlso You: HELLO 911, I AM HAVING A FRITOS EMERGENCY AND HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ABANDON MY BUBBLING CAULDRON OF CHILI OVER A LIVE FIRE WHILE I DRIVE RECKLESSLY FOR 0.2 MILES TO MY NEAREST CVS TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. IF YOU SEE MY PARROT, SEND HELP.", "Yeah that's why I do this. I'm a full time engineer and also a full time student. I work 9-5, go to the gym, go to class, do homework, study every day. By the time all of that is done I have like an hour of free time to myself before I go to bed. I'm not wasting that on cooking and cleaning every night.", "I see. I change my vote, then, to NTA.\n\nBut why didn't you tell her that?", "Never owned or used a slow cooker so I have no input on those honestly. They're self-contained and not gas/an open flame though, right? They're typically electric? I'd like to hope they're safer than a gas stove based on that assumption, and if not, then they're just as dangerous or risky as any other electric appliance, surely?\n\nAlso, I didn't say chili should be banned, nor did I say you should stand there for 6 hours watching it cook. I simply said that the risk of leaving it completely unattended, i.e. leaving the house, isn't worth it. My point was, switch it off if you're leaving the house then switch it back on when you return. At least if you're in the house there's some degree of attendance to it, which is better than none.", "Yeah.", "So did my former coworker. \n\nNo. I don't.  If something needs that long to cook and the prep or other items aren't done simultaneously requiring me to be there regardless, it goes in a crock pot or I find another recipe.", "I told her that, and she didn't care. The roommate that was told was the same roommate who let her into the house when she arrived. So she also knew by default.", "Did he say anywhere if he's using a gas stove?", "That\u2019s long, chefs leave stock to simmer overnight all the time or do you expect them to stand there all night?", "Then she actually sounds insufferable.", "That's a fair point, OP didn't specify. I don't think it changes my opinion much, though, honestly. Are electric stoves statistically safer than gas ones? Genuine question, I've never owned an electric one myself and used one that wasn't mine maybe a handful of times.", "Not the situation posed by OP. \n\nWhat is acceptable/protocol/safe/whatever for a chef to do in a professional, fully-outfitted-with-smoke-detectors-sprinkler-and-security-systems-that-likely-also-respond-to-detected-fires is not necessarily the same as what is safe for a home cook to do in their own.", "Yup. The only adult I have to deal with on a regular basis that throws tantrums. I'm talking screaming, crying, throwing shit, etc.", "I have no concerns leaving my electric stove unattended. I also run my charcoal smoker overnight while I sleep."]}
