While putting in the last few ingredients, I realized I was missing Chipotle peppers and fritos, two things that I love putting in my chilli.\n\n Since there's a grocery store cross the street from my neighborhood (GPS says 0.2miles from my house, literally a one minute drive) I decided to leave the chilli on the stove at the lowest heat and go and grab the missing ingredients quickly. I was back home within 5 minutes of leaving.\n\nWhen I left, one of my roommates was at home and I told him I was running to the store for a second and that I had chili simmering on the stove. My other roommate was gone all day with his girlfriend. \n\nWhen I get back home I'm immediately barraged at the door by my other roommate's girlfriend, who arrived just a minute before me, screaming  about how ridiculous it was of me to leave the stove on unattended. I tried calmly explaining to her that I left right before she got there, and was only gone for 5 minutes. I also calmly explained that I was simmering POUNDS of chili, and that with how much food there was in the wok, and how low the heat was, it would have taken a day and a half before it dried out and became a fire hazard. She didn't care one bit and still yelled at me like a pissed off mother reprimanding a child. \n\nI expressed that I wasn't OK with her yelling at me, especially in my house, and making demands as if she owned the place. Immediately she deflected and made it about how her dog COULD have been there by himself and COULD have been hurt if the house caught on fire (her dog wasn't there, also my house isn't a daycare center for her dog).\n\nI told her I've made chili dozens of times and I've always left it on simmer unattended for hours and hours at a time, mixing it occasionally, and I knew what I was doing. I also made a point that my pet parrot WAS at home while I left to the store, and that if I thought leaving chili on simmer for a few minutes would be a fire hazard, I wouldn't have done that. Birds are extremely sensitive to fumes and smoke (so much that coal miners would bring them into mines to give ample warning if there were toxins in the air)\n\nI told her I would understand her being upset if I did this at her house without permission , but I did this at mine. I also said that it would be different if I left with the stove on max, like if I were searing a steak or something; but this is chili, one of the few foods you leave to cook all day on the lowest heat possible. \n\nLong story short, she blows up and throws a tantrum while saying some less than nice things to me. The next day I overhear her on the phone with my roomate basically talking shit about how I can't take accountability for anything, I'm an asshole, ect.\n\nDo people actually stand around in the kitchen for 6 hours staring at chili while it simmers?

If no one had been there, I would have understood maybe being a bit concerned. But a) you told your roommate so that they were aware b) she doesn't even live there!! She has no right to scream at you about the things you do in your own home. Even if she had a legitimate reason to be up upset, screaming at you was not ok. She sounds either totally unhinged or stewing in hatred for you for something that has nothing to do with this current situation. I suppose it could be both.", "NTA. It's not her house and while it was slightly more dangerous to leave the house with it cooking than just being around the house (but not watching it) while it was cooking, you have experience doing this and were only gone a few minutes.\n\nThat said... two people are going to eat two gallons of chili in one week? Are you sure that's wise?", "I mean yes I get your point though The thing that dose annoys me is that there was someone else in the house which you could\u2019ve asked to go get them for a favour.

You never know what could happen within those few minutes. Fires can start unexpectedly and cause so much damage in such a short space of time. I don't think anyone could truly appreciate how incredibly destructive and inescapable a well-ignited fire is unless they've experienced it first or second-hand. \n\nIs it really so difficult and so far out of your way to just turn the stove off whilst you're out and turn it back on when you return? Is the few extra minutes of convenient cooking-time worth the potential risk?", "Question: I understand the chipotle peppers, but do you put the Fritos in the chili while it cooks or as a crunchy topping when you dish it up to eat it?\nI feel like adding Fritos during the cooking process is a weird move", "I worked with someone whose kitchen was torched because he went into another room for a couple of minutes to help his kid with something. 5 figures for repairs.  Fires start unexpectedly and spread quickly, never mind the smoke damage.  Open flames are like small children in baths. Never leave them unattended. It's a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nPlus, you may own the house, but other people live there. And if they didn't, your house goes up, and you have neighbors you could affect.

Simmering chili will be fine. \n\nMost of the fires I am dispatched on are for food on the stove. They generally produce a ton of smoke and very little fire. Sometimes they burn up the cabinets but the smoke will alert everyone and usually with enough time to prevent anything more than a nasty lingering smell. \n\nDon\u2019t take this as permission to do this more often though. There\u2019s zero percent chance you were gone for five minutes. Even if the store was in your next door neighbors apartment. Time escapes us when we are busy.

The only time I leave the house for an extended period of time while cooking is either my pellet smoker or my crock pot which are pretty darn safe", "Hahaha. I make my chili with lean ground turkey and mainly ingredients from my garden. It's extremely low in fat and super high in protein. My girlfriend and I are on a diet and also work out a lot.

I change my vote, then, to NTA.\n\nBut why didn't you tell her that?", "Never owned or used a slow cooker so I have no input on those honestly. They're self-contained and not gas/an open flame though, right? They're typically electric? I'd like to hope they're safer than a gas stove based on that assumption, and if not, then they're just as dangerous or risky as any other electric appliance, surely?\n\nAlso, I didn't say chili should be banned, nor did I say you should stand there for 6 hours watching it cook. I simply said that the risk of leaving it completely unattended, i.e. leaving the house, isn't worth it. My point was, switch it off if you're leaving the house then switch it back on when you return. At least if you're in the house there's some degree of attendance to it, which is better than none.", "Yeah.", "So did my former coworker. \n\nNo. I don't.  If something needs that long to cook and the prep or other items aren't done simultaneously requiring me to be there regardless, it goes in a crock pot or I find another recipe.", "I told her that, and she didn't care.

I also run my charcoal smoker overnight while I sleep.", "NTA. I was ready to call you the asshole because leaving anything on the stove unattended for any length of time is dangerous. Not just because of the potential for your food to evaporate (which clearly wasn't the case), but accidents happen. Something could have touched the element. But on the other hand, your roommate was there and you told him about it. \n\nFrankly, if I were you, I'd be having a chat with the roommate that allows his gf to berate you in your own home and tries to excuse her behavior by bringing up her dog, which also isn't a member of the household. Maybe it's time for gf to spend less time there for a bit. If she can't be cordial, she can go.", "Has she never heard of a crock pot?

I do understand that fire inside a house is concerning by itself though.\n\nI have 6 years of kitchen experience and I've seen multiple electric devices catch fire in one way or another.\n\nMeanwhile you leave burners going all day and pilot lights on 24/7 and I've never had an issue with a gas range.", "Things I never realized I needed now include a pellet smoker \ud83e\udd72", "I would agree with you if it weren't for the fact I told my roommate who was currently home that I would be gone for only 5 minutes and that I had food on simmer", "That\u2019s extreme especially considering OP let their roommates know that the stove was on. If OP got into an accident, their roommates would have at least seen chili on the stove and remembered", "I freeze individual portions of batch cooked chili, curry or spaghetti sauce - no need to eat the same thing every day", "That\u2019s good to know : )", "Fixed", "too soon\u2026", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "This is my logic as well. I don't see it being any more dangerous than a an instant pot or similar device, and apparently those are fine?", "You have 6 WHOLE YEARS!! Wonderful! \n\nNow let the adults explain.\n\nI have 32 YEARS experience.  In my 32 years, I have never seen one, not one, a heating element for cooking catch fire. Note I said heating element, big difference in electric devices and heating elements. The only one I did see was a blender at a friend's house because it was worthless Sunbeam, and that only sparked and smoked. \n\nWhich takes us to qaulity. Worry about fire, don't go cheap! Check your product thoroughly for cracks , cord damage ,etc before every use.  Get a good quality butcher block cutting board and sit your crock pot on top of it during cooking and away from the wall. Do not have anything else plugged into the outlet.  \n\nIf you've seen multiple devices catch fire in 6 years you've  either done something wrong or buying crap Dollar General.", "They're SO WORTH IT. Set and forget, best food you've ever had comes out hours later with basically no effort. Great for making cheap cuts of meat that are normally chewy into delicious tender bbq", "DO IT", "I still recommend turning food off when you're leaving the house, because although the possibility of something going wrong is extremely small, the possibilities still exist. \n\nI'm old. Old enough and spent enough time working in the medical system to know that \"Better safe than sorry\" are words to live by.", "Actually, if the OP was hit by a car in the street, the roommates might hear the screaming and rush out to help, or just to see who the heck was screaming.  \n\nSeriously, I'm old.  I've seen enough bad shit to know that it really IS better to be safe than sorry.", "Roommates girlfriend found the post", "Most stoves are not open fire. People literally leave their crockpot on for 8+ hours while they aren't at home. Running your dryer while you're out is probably more dangerous than what OP did", "You know there's electric stove tops right? Mines a glass top and my pot is slightly larger than the burner. Literally no risk of anything catching fire....", "Yeah I typically make 2 different meal preps for the week so that I don't get bored of eating the same thing.", "Some people enjoy eating the same thing, especially at lunchtime", "I did that back when we had a chest freezer. Not enough space these days, sadly.", "How exactly is a crock pot less of a fire risk than an electric stove?", "What if you crashed or otherwise were incapacitated and couldn't come back in a short time? Long line at the grocery store, wet floor slip and fall, car windows broken into while you're inside? Turning off the stove for 5 minutes isn't going to ruin the chili if you genuinely only take five minutes to complete your errand. I wouldn't run a crock pot with nobody in the house either. Did your roommate confirm they took responsibility for the food? If so, NTA because it's not unattended. If not, YTA.", "What a bizarre reaction to a perfectly rational take. An electrical appliance is more likely to malfunction than a stove on low heat. That's just a fact. This person was not rude or condescending and the OP didn't think they were either. You may have 32 years on them but \"the adult certainly wasn't talking\" in your reply. - a 40 year old. Not to mention if their kitchen experience is as an actual professional in a professional kitchen, it's perfectly reasonable to assume they may have seen electrical appliances catch fire in a second.", "Would you like a medal?", "I have seen it happen. Oil caught fire on pan.", "You're a good Among humans\npraise unto your chili may you have better luck than Kevin of The Office", "Seriously, you can keep doubling down but it\u2019s a little ridiculous at this point", "https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/gas-stove-safety\n\nUnfortunately, electric stoves are statistically *more* likely to cause a house fire.", "Also don\u2019t forget that OP could have walked out the front and been hit by a nuclear explosion causing a mushroom cloud over his house and we all know that mushroom doesn\u2019t go in his chilli recipe then the roommate at home would have to explain why there is now mushroom in the chilli and the entire house is destroyed. \n\nI mean if you had seen what I\u2019ve seen /s", "If you'd seen the shit I've seen, you would do.", "Home cooks also leave their stocks to simmer for hours. That\u02bbs part of making a stock. In a restaurant or at home.", "Op still not the asshole.", "I'm going to ask the obvious, why do you allow her in your house? If anybody pulled that shit in my house they would be out the door in about 3 seconds and they would not come back trust me."]}
