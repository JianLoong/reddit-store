All my life I\u2019ve lived with my mom since I don\u2019t make enough money to live on my own ( especially since I live in LA county California ) so I\u2019ve been living with her while I save up. \nWell my mom got married with her now husband and my now stepfather in September of 2022. At the time, my mother and I lived in an apartment, so when her lease was up, she decided she wanted to move into my stepdad\u2019s house. That was fine with me, since I actually really respect and love my stepdad. He\u2019s a great guy! \nAt the time, my stepdad has his own son who lives with him. The house is a 2 bed 1 bath. The master goes to my stepdad and mom, while the spare bedroom goes to my step brother. I got the couch in the living room. I was fine with that situation since it was how my mom and I entered his household and didn\u2019t want to overstep my boundaries. \nWell, after living here for roughly 5 months, my stepbrother has used his room for a sum total of 7-8 times in that 5 month span. He doesn\u2019t even use it to sleep, he just uses it to keep his clothes and stuff. He is at his GF\u2019s house and sleeps their 99.99% of the time. I genuinely miss having my own privacy, an actual bed ( not the couch that I\u2019m currently sleeping on ) , and overall a room I can claim as my own. \nMy stepbro and I pay zero rent currently. I\u2019ve asked my mom if I were to pay rent, May I have the spare room, and she asked me to ask my stepdad but I don\u2019t wanna sound like the evil stepson/brother, but I\u2019m also tired of having that damn empty room constantly being there vacant and I have to get the couch. WIBTA if ask to take over the room? \n\nALSO: before I\u2019m harassed for being an adult who still lives at home rent free; I\u2019ve offered to pay rent but was declined multiple times, so please don\u2019t think I\u2019m some free loader leach. \n\nTLDR; I want to ask my stepdad if I can have the spare bedroom since my stepbrother is never there to use it.\n\nEdit; I apologize to everyone saying I need to move out and leave my mom and stepdad alone. I tried moving out but my mom was sad to learn that I was living in my car since I can\u2019t afford my own place yet. And I\u2019ve tried getting roommates but I\u2019ve found that since Covid happened, people don\u2019t allow strangers in as easily and  my friends and I all have \u201c baby credit \u201c or \u201c haven\u2019t been at job long enough \u201c so we can\u2019t get approved for a spot of our own. Living in California currently is a headache for someone not making much! I\u2019m not making excuses, and if I could, I 110% absolutely would leave, but my only option currently is parents house or car. I have zero problems with staying my car for a while but my mom does, plus it\u2019s nice having a heater for the night when compared to the 30-40 degree nights I slept in.

You can even ask for the compromise of sharing the room for personal belongings/storage and when step bro comes home to spend the night you can go on the couch or you guys can get a trundle bed or a fold away or whatever.

Rent is astronomical and that does only apply to adult children, but also to parents. Often times, parents and their adult kids rely on each other to be able to afford to do things like pay rent and have food to eat. When I was 18, my rent was 525and I had a roommate. My oldest is 20 and her rent is $800/month and she has literally SIX roommates. Her rent is actually low for our area. She is barely making it even with our little bit of help.
