All my life I\u2019ve lived with my mom since I don\u2019t make enough money to live on my own ( especially since I live in LA county California ) so I\u2019ve been living with her while I save up. \nWell my mom got married with her now husband and my now stepfather in September of 2022. At the time, my mother and I lived in an apartment, so when her lease was up, she decided she wanted to move into my stepdad\u2019s house. That was fine with me, since I actually really respect and love my stepdad. He\u2019s a great guy! \nAt the time, my stepdad has his own son who lives with him. The house is a 2 bed 1 bath. The master goes to my stepdad and mom, while the spare bedroom goes to my step brother. I got the couch in the living room. I was fine with that situation since it was how my mom and I entered his household and didn\u2019t want to overstep my boundaries. \nWell, after living here for roughly 5 months, my stepbrother has used his room for a sum total of 7-8 times in that 5 month span. He doesn\u2019t even use it to sleep, he just uses it to keep his clothes and stuff. He is at his GF\u2019s house and sleeps their 99.99% of the time. I genuinely miss having my own privacy, an actual bed ( not the couch that I\u2019m currently sleeping on ) , and overall a room I can claim as my own. \nMy stepbro and I pay zero rent currently. I\u2019ve asked my mom if I were to pay rent, May I have the spare room, and she asked me to ask my stepdad but I don\u2019t wanna sound like the evil stepson/brother, but I\u2019m also tired of having that damn empty room constantly being there vacant and I have to get the couch.

I tried moving out but my mom was sad to learn that I was living in my car since I can\u2019t afford my own place yet. And I\u2019ve tried getting roommates but I\u2019ve found that since Covid happened, people don\u2019t allow strangers in as easily and  my friends and I all have \u201c baby credit \u201c or \u201c haven\u2019t been at job long enough \u201c so we can\u2019t get approved for a spot of our own. Living in California currently is a headache for someone not making much! I\u2019m not making excuses, and if I could, I 110% absolutely would leave, but my only option currently is parents house or car. I have zero problems with staying my car for a while but my mom does, plus it\u2019s nice having a heater for the night when compared to the 30-40 degree nights I slept in.
