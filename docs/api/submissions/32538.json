Instead of spending it all on myself I decided to adopt a sibling pair from the angel tree (something that you can do to buy presents for kids who wouldn\u2019t get Christmas without it) I really only needed about $100 worth of stuff from Amazon so I ordered my stuff and set a $200 budget for each kid. I asked to talk to my aunts 14 year old son because I have no clue what 14 year old boys like and both of my kids are teenagers. When she asked why I told her my plan and she freaked out saying I could spend that money getting gifts for family and friends. My boyfriend basically said the same thing to me. He said he\u2019s not even spending money on his parents and it would be better to buy them gifts than these kids. My aunt said I\u2019m using my \u201cchildhood trauma\u201d to justify this decision. I think that these kids have nothing and literally everyone in my family/friend circle is well off so the kids deserve this. Especially because they\u2019re teenagers and no one likes to adopt teenagers off of the tree. Maybe I am using my trauma to justify it though. Someone please give me insight.\nETA: I\u2019m a college student and a broke one at that, so I won\u2019t be buying anyone a gift besides the kids lol\nETA again: my family not only let me go into foster care, but age out of it, so we don\u2019t have the strongest or healthiest relationship, that may be another reason I\u2019m not too keen on buying them gifts, yet so willing to do so for these kids.

THANK YOU for putting that good in the world!", "NTA. Your only mistake in this was telling your family about your plans. I get it that you needed advice on what to buy, but you could have worked that out without involving your entitled family. Your family is not entitled to receive gifts from you. I think you are doing a very good thing by buying gifts for less privileged kids. Rather than calling it \"using your trauma\" I would call it \"being conscious of what it is like to be less privileged and wanting to do something about it\". A bit long, I know, but hopefully with a more positive ring to it.", "NTA. So what if you're \"using your trauma to justify it?\"  What a hideous thing to say. If your trauma inspires kindness, compassion and empathy that's a positive and healing thing. You don't need to justify this to anyone. Enjoy the shopping and have fun spreading joy to kids who need it!", "NTA- this is a lovely way to pay the gift forward to people who would really love it.", "NTA. It's extremely kind of you to use that money on those kids. It doesn't sounds like your family and friends are in the same situation, and they will be getting gifts from other people. Like you said, the angel tree kids might not get anything for Christmas otherwise and this could create a very special memory for them. You are doing the right thing. \n\nAlso your aunt sounds rude bringing up your childhood trauma. It sounds like she is the one using it as an excuse to shame you into doing what she wants.

I know \u00a3500 sounds like a lot not and you don't need much but there's a reason you got the \u00a3500. You don't have to spend it all at once- you can leave it on your account for things you will need later. If you don't have bank of mom and dad that's really important to have stashes you can spend. \nYou might not need things now but you will later, especially at your age. If you really want to gift something, give a small item, not the majority of the gift card. The person who gifted it, intended for you to receive it. \nThings get really expensive post college and you'll need things for your life post then. \nWhen you're earning more and more stable financially is the time to gift- it's okay not to do it now.", "NTA I think what you\u2019re doing is awesome personally, don\u2019t let other people decide for you what you want to do.

Good luck OP, you will probably find so much joy out of helping these kids.  \n\nYou made a really awesome choice. \n\nThe family members who are fussing, need to learn what the real meaning of giving is, they may benefit from following your example and helping someone who is less fortunate.", "NAH.

I don\u2019t expect gifts but if you go to the trouble of asking me what I\u2019d like then it feels like a bait and switch to get nothing.", "I agree that $200 for a budget is too much.  I wouldn't spend that much on extended family, much less strangers.  You can help a lot more people with a smaller budget, if that's how you plan to use your card.", "ESH. Why would you ask your cousins what kind of presents they would like to get if you weren\u2019t going to get them anything? That\u2019s ridiculous and rude?

I want to do this so bad but I dont know where they do this", "NTA If your family will get gifts and don't have issues with money or food the rest of the year, you don't need to give them extravagant gifts, or anything at all. It's a good thing that you are doing. And you are right, people don't really want to buy for teenagers, especially boys. I know my mom picked a tag like that off of a similar tree at her church. \n\nJust out of curiosity, was there anything on the tags like clothes sizes? Because chances are, that's probably something they really need, if it's listed.", "NTA - you\u2019re kind and generous. It would probably have been better if your family didn\u2019t know, but too bad. I like the idea that someone posted of baking  everyone some cookies. That\u2019s an excellent idea. That way they\u2019re not forgotten.", "NTA \n\n\nBut does your aunt help you financially at all? Are you going there for Christmas? Are they planning to buy you a gift, if so, make sure to say that you don't want to do gift exchanges and don't expect anything. \n\n\nIf your aunt is blaming your \"trauma\" (and yes, everyone's experiences shape their decisions in the future), why was she not there supporting you while you were in foster care?", "Your money, you spend it where you want.

Your family are greedy little grabbers who want you to buy them things. They are freaking out because you aren\u2019t. Then, they had the audacity to throw childhood trauma in your face as a reason you shouldn\u2019t care about other people. They absolutely suck and you should not take any lessons on morality from any of them. Do your acts of service and kindness any way you see fit. And, if your background calls you to help kids at Christmas, that\u2019s not something to feel bad about. Plus, you were given that money because of a foster group, I can think of nothing better than to spend that money on kids, unless you were using it for your own needs, which would be totally fine and completely appropriate. Don\u2019t spend a second feeling bad for not spending money on the people insulting you for being generous to those with little. NTA", "NTA. So, none of your family stepped up to keep you out of foster care but feel entitled to gifts from you? Invite them to kiss your ass for the holidays.", "NTA. Your history makes you more aware of the needs of foster kids or kids in need. That doesn't equate to \"using your childhood trauma\" as an excuse. It sounds as if your attachment to your family was broken through your experiences. Just because your aunt doesn't want to feel bad about it doesn't mean it didn't happen or that you don't have a right to follow your own feelings.\n\nAnd are you saying your boyfriend who's not buying his parents presents wants you to spend your money on them? Because that's pure selfishness.", "NTA \nYou would be making a huge difference for those teens, and that's awesome. It's okay to help others to heal your trauma, that's not a bad thing", "NTA, but I don't think it was smart to talk to your aunt about this. Talking to your cousin probably would have resulted in hurt feelings since he would know you asked him about what boys *his age* like and then got it *for someone else*.\n\nUsually, those kinds of programs have the families write down some things the kids want or need anyway, so I'm not sure why you'd ask at all.\n\nPlus, every kid is different, so these kids might not even like the same things your nephew does.", "Soooooo  NTA\n\nWhat a great way to share what you have been given.  If you feel in your heart to share with kids that would otherwise not have anything, then you should follow that feeling.\n\nIt's your decision how you spend the gift you were given, not your families.  I believe this is such a kind gesture on your part, so much respect for you.\n\nEnjoy the blessing of giving!!", "In the UK there's a store called Dunelm that does something every Christmas called \"the giving tree\".

There is absolutely nothing wrong with spreading happiness if you can safely do so (aka, you can afford it).  NTA", "NTA. You are so very kind OP. \n\nThose children likely have next to nothing. They will be so appreciative of a generous gift. \n\nI\u2019m assuming your family has a roof over their head, lots of food to eat, love for each other, and all of the comforts of day to day life. If they want something for Christmas they should buy it themselves.\n\nAlso it\u2019s your money. You spend it how you want to.", "NTA. You understand something that they don't.

You are being a good person.", "There have been times in my life when I've been broke...like broke. One time all I had was $1 to my name. That dollar could have bought me a hot dog at least but instead I gave it to a homeless person. I've never regretted it or the times I've bought gifts for those in need even though in truth I probably needed it more. What this means is, you have a compassionate heart. That is something to be proud of and protect. I'm missing how you BF thinks buying gifts for his parents would supersede that of giving to a child in need. That alone should give you some pause for this relationship. He should be supporting your decision. Give to those in need, and let go of trying to please your family. NTA and good on you.", "NTA. It\u2019s your money to spend the way you want to.
