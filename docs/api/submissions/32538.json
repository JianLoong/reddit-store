Instead of spending it all on myself I decided to adopt a sibling pair from the angel tree (something that you can do to buy presents for kids who wouldn\u2019t get Christmas without it) I really only needed about $100 worth of stuff from Amazon so I ordered my stuff and set a $200 budget for each kid. I asked to talk to my aunts 14 year old son because I have no clue what 14 year old boys like and both of my kids are teenagers. When she asked why I told her my plan and she freaked out saying I could spend that money getting gifts for family and friends. My boyfriend basically said the same thing to me. He said he\u2019s not even spending money on his parents and it would be better to buy them gifts than these kids. My aunt said I\u2019m using my \u201cchildhood trauma\u201d to justify this decision. I think that these kids have nothing and literally everyone in my family/friend circle is well off so the kids deserve this. Especially because they\u2019re teenagers and no one likes to adopt teenagers off of the tree. Maybe I am using my trauma to justify it though. Someone please give me insight.\nETA: I\u2019m a college student and a broke one at that, so I won\u2019t be buying anyone a gift besides the kids lol\nETA again: my family not only let me go into foster care, but age out of it, so we don\u2019t have the strongest or healthiest relationship, that may be another reason I\u2019m not too keen on buying them gifts, yet so willing to do so for these kids.

I get it that you needed advice on what to buy, but you could have worked that out without involving your entitled family. Your family is not entitled to receive gifts from you.

They absolutely suck and you should not take any lessons on morality from any of them. Do your acts of service and kindness any way you see fit.

I've never regretted it or the times I've bought gifts for those in need even though in truth I probably needed it more. What this means is, you have a compassionate heart. That is something to be proud of and protect. I'm missing how you BF thinks buying gifts for his parents would supersede that of giving to a child in need.
