Like, are you renting out the space/paying for things/etc? Or is it just \"Hey, meet me here to hang out\".

My late husband worked away 80% of the time so it was me and my precious baby peaches. Let me tell you a little story about my parasite. She was born a month early and had a grudge against humanity. She was not a happy child until she learned to walk, before she was even 8 months old. Then she learned to CLIMB like a freakin blond haired blue eyed spider monkey with curly hair that would hide above door frames and dropped down on you like a demon monkey or climb into the top cupboards in the laundry room after she opened the door to our yard to play hide and seek. So you end up calling the cops and yelling her name and she eventually opens the door and yells surprise mama. This was at 2. I also had a severe accident when she was 10 months old so I was on crutches most of her early childhood because of surgeries. I used 2 child gates stacked at each door because she would climb over them. I used harness\u2019s and \u201cI am a horrible mother\u201d I put her and her dog in his kennel with snacks in front of the tv with her favorite movie \u201cLILO and Stitch\u201d and yes I see the irony just so I could do dishes and laundry. She is now 20 and we have a great relationship. I call her my parasite she calls me her former skin suit or host. I love her with every fiber of my being but I would have sold a kidney for a fun night at a play park that was not filled with a dozen children I had to corral.", "NTA you can choose to invite whoever you want as it's your party. But also they're 4, they literally can't bowl or do the bumper carts. I bet they aren't even tall enough to reach half the arcade games. \n\nIf they were older I would maybe consider making an exception depending on your relationship with them.", "NTA. You don't want kids at your party.", "That's a thoughtful consideration, but not a barrier in this case. Another relative offered to watch them for free.", "Maybe they just like the attention they receive from others when they show off their (to them) adorable little twin wonders.", "No my guy, we rented out the place. Won't be open to the public.", "That would be terrible if that was the case. The party is for OP. Seems selfish of her sister to be so demanding.", "Wasn't that Michael Jackson's epitaph?", "Even if they didn't book a private room, they are not part of their party.  That is the point. Therefore OP is not responsible for any damages or injuries. \n\nThey are not in OPs party, so they are not OPs problem. If they are in OPs party, then they are responsible for them to an extent.", "I\u2019m a parent and I would never think to bring my kids to an adult party. Adults need time for themselves once in awhile.", "Their behavior is even more strange, then. IDK, enjoy your party!", "Can I come? /s but really, this sounds amazing", "My friend group took one of the girls to Dave and busters for her bachelorette party. We were in our mid 20s at the time.

I\u2019m 36 and unless you\u2019re planning this party for five months time you\u2019re actually older than me and I can\u2019t think of any of my peers post us being age 12 going in for this. This where I\u2019m from is little kiddy stuff, primary school kiddies. My 8 year old would love this, my 13 year old and his friends would think it was equal to waterboarding. Nostalgia would be highschool from 12-16 or late teens early 20s things.", "Good thing you\u2019re not invited then!", "Deffo. That\u2019s the kind of party if my kids get invited to I want to drop and run. It\u2019s probably cultural. Bowling is more an old man\u2019s thing here too so that wouldn\u2019t really fly.", "NTA but I do think having a birthday party at an arcade, inviting family and telling them the kids aren\u2019t allowed to come is a bit odd.\n\nNot an asshole, but something I definitely couldn\u2019t imagine in my own family TBH.", "NTA The twins are 4 years old. What exactly are they going to be doing all night? They're too young to bowl or do bumper cars. They're probably too young for most of the arcade games too just for the sheer lack of height.

They\u2019re far too entitled", "NTA\n\nYou can have your birthday however you like. \n\nI have kids and I would absolutely not be offended or upset by being invited to an adults only event.", "NTA. It's not typical, in my experience anyhow, for single or childless adults to have birthday parties that include kids. If you weren't going to the arcade you'd be at a bar or having a backyard BBQ etc, with your adult friends, not your whole family including kids. Of course many people do celebrate birthdays with family, but I'd say that other than parents including their kids at their birthday celebration, it's not typical for a guy in his 30's or 40's to have a kid-friendly birthday party.", "NTA\n\nIf the kids had been old enough to actually participate in anything this place has to offer, I might have voted the other way, but 4 years old is younger than the intended audience of this establishment anyway.\n\nIt would a bit different if they were old enough that the parents could just hand them some money and tell them to come back when it's time to leave.", "Info: why are you sending invites for a party that is months away?", "NTA\nYour party your rules", "NTA.

An arcade has games and my children should be able to play! /s\n\nOP, hold your ground. It's an ADULT party. Just because it is being held in an arcade doesn't mean that your niblings should come.

You won't hold it against them if they can't come.", "NTA in anyway. My friends have kids, I don't. 99% of the time, kid friendly meet ups. That 1% is either organised without the kids, or mum is sick of her little brats and leaves them with her sister. For our 34th (the one with kids at the time, is a week older than me, so we usually meet up around our birthday), we went into the city and had a whiskey high tea and then took a stroll before deciding on a little out of the way restaurant for dinner. We all had a great time and didn't have to worry about keeping an eye on the kids. We could actually relax and be adults without much worry.", "NTA I have kids and they are not for everyone.", "NTA for reasons already repeated ad nauseum. \n\nI'm curious what you had planned for the special outing with your nieces.

The kids wouldn\u2019t even remember the party. NTA", "NTA- I will never understand the entitlement of receiving an invitation and responding to it with \"You have to change this event for me.\" The presence of children fundamentally changes an event, as they are not just asking you to let them be there, oh no, they're expecting the behavior, language and music to be appropriate also, meaning no tipsily singing along to NWA and doing your Randy from South Park crotch wiggle, and definitely no Bloodhound Gang. So they are basically asking to take the event you wanted and organised away from you and make it an 'everyone stands around slightly uncomfortably talking at low volume and tries to hide their disappointment when the kids get on the bumper cars at the same time as them and they have to play nice rather than go 'Blood Drive' thing. I don't see why you owe it to two 4 YOs not to have a good birthday.", "NTA god I\u2019m fed up with entitled parents", "They are looking for things to complain about!

Where one of those missiles could Houdini away and decide to run around on the lanes?\n\nIt would become all about the children and adults trying to manuver around them while your sister might blame someone you invited for the slightest tear.

I agree to do a family only party though. Happy birthday !", "NTA.

It\u2019s just a birthday party, not a major life/family event. Four year olds won\u2019t remember going or not going haha.

It\u2019s fine.\n\nYou offered a compromise but it sounds like their issue is that they can\u2019t find a babysitter and have FOMO for this specific kinda party. I feel for them but oh well tbh? It\u2019s just a party and their kids should be more important.\n\nEdit to add: Idk if this helps but you obviously planned a really fun night. I totally get not wanting kids there and I think they\u2019re probably a bit jealous (it\u2019s the FOMO) which I also get. So maybe set aside an available day for the four of you to have similar fun? Or maybe not, if y\u2019all aren\u2019t close. Just a thought!", "NTA.  It might be that they read the invitation out loud and the children heard it and want to go.

It sucks a little, but that's just life. I certainly wouldn't expect family to bend over backwards just to suit us.", "NTA. This makes me NUTS.

The Goddess made babysitters for a reason.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your party.\n\nI have a kid but I'm totally not fussed if a party or wedding is \"adults only\"...
