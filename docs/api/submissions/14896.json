Your party, your invite list. They can decline if they want. But still, it's your party.", "NTA.  They would have to watch the kids the entire time and wouldn't be able to participate in the party anyways.  I also don't see why they would want them around a bunch of drunk adults driving bumper cars.", "NTA. your party and your decision. Your sister and brother in law will need to get a babysitter.", "NTA, disclaimer I also don't have kids but it's pretty normal to ask adults to not bring very young kids to a party. The fact that you offered to hang out with them separately means you're clearly not blowing them off, and anyway there's a 99 percent change that they'd enjoy the more private get together with you signifigantly more than the party with no other kids present", "Nta, fam even when I was a kid I understood there were place that I wasn't allowed to go, and mind you i was a kid and understood this, so your sister and bil should understand that if they can't get a babysitter then they should just decline and go to the separate event you offered, after all it's your birthday not theirs they don't get to demand you change the rules for your birthday or in general since you know their not paying for anything, seriously in my honest opinion they are acting like immature entitled brats instead of adults.", "NTA\n\nI was expecting the nieces to be 15 or 16 and that would have been a Y T A - as I feel it's fair for almost adults to want to hang out with adults but at the grand old age of 4 it's ridiculous to include the nieces", "NTA I have kids, and I know exactly where you are coming from. It\u2019s healthy for both kids and parents to have a break from each other. It\u2019s also entitled to believe that your children belong at every event.", "NTA. Your sis and BIL are acting weird. Maybe they don't want to pay for childcare?", "NTA having kids present makes a completely different vibe and if you want an adults only party there is absolutely nothing wrong with that regardless of the venue.", "NTA. I love kids but parents have to understand that they are not always welcome. Also - when my kids were that age I would have been thrilled to be an invited to an adults-only evening.", "Nta. As a mother of two I will straight up say I LOVE going to adults only parties! So much more fun and I love the idea of forgetting to be a mom for a night!", "NTA\n\nYou want to have a party with just adults. You accept that this means that parents of children might choose not to come. That's a perfectly reasonable choice - you are accepting both the choice, and the consequence of that choice.\n\nThat said, I don't think you'd be hypocritical if you only invited children you were related to. You could be holding a party for family and friends. The children of your siblings are your family, but the children of your friends are not your friends.", "It\u2019s a bit weird you\u2019re having what\u2019s essentially a kiddies birthday party and not allowing kids. If it was in a nightclub or a pub crawl or something I\u2019d get it but you\u2019ve just described my thirteen year olds seventh birthday party.", "NTA \n\n\nThere wouldn't have been anything wrong with just inviting your nieces (inviting some kids doesn't make you obligated to invite other people's kids....Kids are people, not a monolith group), but there is nothing wrong with it being adult only.\n\n\nBut how organized is this \"party\"? Like, are you renting out the space/paying for things/etc? Or is it just \"Hey, meet me here to hang out\". Because if it's a public place, and just everyone hanging out doing their own things, it's reasonable to think that everyone can come with whoever they want and just stop by to say hi.", "Normally I would side with the person hosting the party but if you don't want kids around why are you holding your party in a place that will have children from people not at your party present?  This makes no sense to me.  YTA for holding your party at a place children will already be present and stating adults only.", "Only the best parties have underage children", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s your party you want adults only why do they think they are so special you need to make an exception for them? I get fed up of reading about these entitled people who get offended their kids aren\u2019t invited and can\u2019t believe other people don\u2019t love their kids and always want them around. They really can\u2019t spend 1 evening away from them? You offered an alternative celebration you didn\u2019t have to, they should respect what you want to do for your birthday.", "I understand where your sister is coming from, but it\u2019s still not your problem.

Don't invite family to parties with your adult friends if they can't follow a simple request that you as an adult want to celebrate as an adult, with only adults. I agree have a second party for family. You get two parties that way. :) Happy Birthday. You are NTA, but your sis and BiL are entitled AHs.", "Nta as a mom of 2.

Haha, I figured there'd be parents out there who appreciated this sort of thing. I'm hoping my friends do too, but as I said, if they don't/can't, that's totally okay with me. It's an open door invitation, not mandatory community service, lol.", "I'm from a small town and there's really not anything else to do party-wise except eat at a restaurant. The place is booked months in advance, and you'd be surprised how many of them are parties for adults, haha. They even offer special bookings for corporate gatherings and fundraisers. Kinda strange I know, but it's what we've got, lol.", "Dude no! Me and my way adult siblings LOVE arcades! And don't really like kids so I love that OP is renting out the arcade for adults only.", "Seriously, right? After you become an adult, all kid activities and behavior are hella lame. \n\nLike drinking water? Fuck no, wine all the tiiiiime! Naps? Nah, man, I'm awake 24/7 like an Adult. And don\u2019t even get me started on having nostalgic fun with friends in a way that lets you briefly enjoy the carefreeness of childhood.\n\nAdults *must* have Adult\u2122\ufe0f fun. Alcohol. Blow. Clubs. (The ABCs, if you will!) Otherwise, it's super weird not to invite every child you know. It's not like children completely alter (or even murder) the vibe of a gathering. Like, who cares about that?", "Good question! We're renting and paying for the private space, so the venue won't be open to the public during the party.", "We booked the whole venue for a private party, so it'll actually just be my party and me in the building.", "Yeah, that sentiment has always rubbed me the wrong way. It's implying my capacity for empathy is somehow flawed because I don't have kids... Ironically, it's a pretty condescending and unempathetic thing to say to someone.", "I'm not saying they'd hate being there just that one on one time with their uncle would probably make for a more valuable and altogether enjoyable birthday celebration than one where the only person they know that isn't their parents is spending most of his time hanging out with his adult friends", "Are four years olds even tall enough to play most arcade games?", "No it's not strange. It sounds like a blast. I'm an adult with no kids, can I come?? Lol", "Most four year olds are neither tall enough nor coordinated enough."]}
