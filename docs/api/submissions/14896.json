Your party, your invite list. They can decline if they want. But still, it's your party.", "NTA.  They would have to watch the kids the entire time and wouldn't be able to participate in the party anyways.  I also don't see why they would want them around a bunch of drunk adults driving bumper cars.", "NTA. your party and your decision. Your sister and brother in law will need to get a babysitter.", "NTA, disclaimer I also don't have kids but it's pretty normal to ask adults to not bring very young kids to a party. The fact that you offered to hang out with them separately means you're clearly not blowing them off, and anyway there's a 99 percent change that they'd enjoy the more private get together with you signifigantly more than the party with no other kids present", "Nta, fam even when I was a kid I understood there were place that I wasn't allowed to go, and mind you i was a kid and understood this, so your sister and bil should understand that if they can't get a babysitter then they should just decline and go to the separate event you offered, after all it's your birthday not theirs they don't get to demand you change the rules for your birthday or in general since you know their not paying for anything, seriously in my honest opinion they are acting like immature entitled brats instead of adults.", "NTA\n\nI was expecting the nieces to be 15 or 16 and that would have been a Y T A - as I feel it's fair for almost adults to want to hang out with adults but at the grand old age of 4 it's ridiculous to include the nieces", "NTA I have kids, and I know exactly where you are coming from. It\u2019s healthy for both kids and parents to have a break from each other. It\u2019s also entitled to believe that your children belong at every event.", "NTA. Your sis and BIL are acting weird. Maybe they don't want to pay for childcare?", "NTA having kids present makes a completely different vibe and if you want an adults only party there is absolutely nothing wrong with that regardless of the venue.", "NTA. I love kids but parents have to understand that they are not always welcome. Also - when my kids were that age I would have been thrilled to be an invited to an adults-only evening.", "Nta. As a mother of two I will straight up say I LOVE going to adults only parties! So much more fun and I love the idea of forgetting to be a mom for a night!", "NTA\n\nYou want to have a party with just adults. You accept that this means that parents of children might choose not to come. That's a perfectly reasonable choice - you are accepting both the choice, and the consequence of that choice.\n\nThat said, I don't think you'd be hypocritical if you only invited children you were related to. You could be holding a party for family and friends. The children of your siblings are your family, but the children of your friends are not your friends.", "It\u2019s a bit weird you\u2019re having what\u2019s essentially a kiddies birthday party and not allowing kids. If it was in a nightclub or a pub crawl or something I\u2019d get it but you\u2019ve just described my thirteen year olds seventh birthday party.", "NTA \n\n\nThere wouldn't have been anything wrong with just inviting your nieces (inviting some kids doesn't make you obligated to invite other people's kids....Kids are people, not a monolith group), but there is nothing wrong with it being adult only.\n\n\nBut how organized is this \"party\"? Like, are you renting out the space/paying for things/etc? Or is it just \"Hey, meet me here to hang out\". Because if it's a public place, and just everyone hanging out doing their own things, it's reasonable to think that everyone can come with whoever they want and just stop by to say hi.", "Normally I would side with the person hosting the party but if you don't want kids around why are you holding your party in a place that will have children from people not at your party present?  This makes no sense to me.  YTA for holding your party at a place children will already be present and stating adults only.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s your party you want adults only why do they think they are so special you need to make an exception for them? I get fed up of reading about these entitled people who get offended their kids aren\u2019t invited and can\u2019t believe other people don\u2019t love their kids and always want them around. They really can\u2019t spend 1 evening away from them? You offered an alternative celebration you didn\u2019t have to, they should respect what you want to do for your birthday.", "I understand where your sister is coming from, but it\u2019s still not your problem.  Your party, your decision.\n\nNTA but don\u2019t be surprised if this strains your relationship with your sister and your nieces.", "NTA don\u2019t you just Loooove those parents who think Their child(ren) are Always the exception to Every rule.", "Simple solution. Don't invite family to parties with your adult friends if they can't follow a simple request that you as an adult want to celebrate as an adult, with only adults. I agree have a second party for family. You get two parties that way. :) Happy Birthday. You are NTA, but your sis and BiL are entitled AHs.", "Nta as a mom of 2.

Haha, I figured there'd be parents out there who appreciated this sort of thing. I'm hoping my friends do too, but as I said, if they don't/can't, that's totally okay with me. It's an open door invitation, not mandatory community service, lol.", "I'm from a small town and there's really not anything else to do party-wise except eat at a restaurant. The place is booked months in advance, and you'd be surprised how many of them are parties for adults, haha. They even offer special bookings for corporate gatherings and fundraisers. Kinda strange I know, but it's what we've got, lol.", "Dude no! Me and my way adult siblings LOVE arcades! And don't really like kids so I love that OP is renting out the arcade for adults only.", "Seriously, right? After you become an adult, all kid activities and behavior are hella lame. \n\nLike drinking water? Fuck no, wine all the tiiiiime! Naps? Nah, man, I'm awake 24/7 like an Adult. And don\u2019t even get me started on having nostalgic fun with friends in a way that lets you briefly enjoy the carefreeness of childhood.\n\nAdults *must* have Adult\u2122\ufe0f fun. Alcohol. Blow. Clubs. (The ABCs, if you will!) Otherwise, it's super weird not to invite every child you know. It's not like children completely alter (or even murder) the vibe of a gathering. Like, who cares about that?", "Good question! We're renting and paying for the private space, so the venue won't be open to the public during the party.", "We booked the whole venue for a private party, so it'll actually just be my party and me in the building.", "Yeah, that sentiment has always rubbed me the wrong way. It's implying my capacity for empathy is somehow flawed because I don't have kids... Ironically, it's a pretty condescending and unempathetic thing to say to someone.", "I'm not saying they'd hate being there just that one on one time with their uncle would probably make for a more valuable and altogether enjoyable birthday celebration than one where the only person they know that isn't their parents is spending most of his time hanging out with his adult friends", "Are four years olds even tall enough to play most arcade games?", "No it's not strange. It sounds like a blast. I'm an adult with no kids, can I come?? Lol", "Most four year olds are neither tall enough nor coordinated enough.", "NTA. There are times and places where children are included. An adult birthday party is not one of those times or places.", "NTA!  I didn\u2019t want kids at my wedding and people bitched and moaned about it.  It was my wedding, it was classy, and no kids.  It\u2019s your party, you call the shots!", "NTA but you know kids will be everywhere at this venue, right?", "NTA \nIt is irresponsible to bring children to an adult-only party. It is not a place for children and parents who don't see the problem should be forced to give birth all over again and apply for a new licence to have children.", "NTA. Everyone wants to be the exception.", "That\u2019s right. You DON\u2019T have kids. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t want them at your party!\n\nNTA", "lol, parents like this are ridiculous. Why do they always think they\u2019re so special they can skirt the rules? No one can relax when little kids are running around. The parents can\u2019t really participate because they\u2019ll be chasing their kids.\n\nNTA. Let them stay home with their offspring and enjoy your party!", "NTA I do have kids and I still don't understand where they're coming from. Why would they want to bring their 4 year old children to an adult event where adult things will be happening? That's not even good parenting. They need to climb down off their high horses.", "NTA \n\nLol. Had adults only 40th in one city. Had adults only 40th in home city with family. Had kid friendly 40th another weekend. \n\nNo one wants to do tequila shots and trip over a 4 year old we didn\u2019t see because they are so short.", "NTA as a mom do you know how many times I would have killed for a night like this one. My late husband worked away 80% of the time so it was me and my precious baby peaches. Let me tell you a little story about my parasite. She was born a month early and had a grudge against humanity. She was not a happy child until she learned to walk, before she was even 8 months old. Then she learned to CLIMB like a freakin blond haired blue eyed spider monkey with curly hair that would hide above door frames and dropped down on you like a demon monkey or climb into the top cupboards in the laundry room after she opened the door to our yard to play hide and seek. So you end up calling the cops and yelling her name and she eventually opens the door and yells surprise mama. This was at 2. I also had a severe accident when she was 10 months old so I was on crutches most of her early childhood because of surgeries. I used 2 child gates stacked at each door because she would climb over them. I used harness\u2019s and \u201cI am a horrible mother\u201d I put her and her dog in his kennel with snacks in front of the tv with her favorite movie \u201cLILO and Stitch\u201d and yes I see the irony just so I could do dishes and laundry. She is now 20 and we have a great relationship. I call her my parasite she calls me her former skin suit or host. I love her with every fiber of my being but I would have sold a kidney for a fun night at a play park that was not filled with a dozen children I had to corral.", "NTA you can choose to invite whoever you want as it's your party. But also they're 4, they literally can't bowl or do the bumper carts. I bet they aren't even tall enough to reach half the arcade games. \n\nIf they were older I would maybe consider making an exception depending on your relationship with them.", "NTA. You don't want kids at your party.", "That's a thoughtful consideration, but not a barrier in this case. Another relative offered to watch them for free.", "Maybe they just like the attention they receive from others when they show off their (to them) adorable little twin wonders.", "No my guy, we rented out the place. Won't be open to the public.", "That would be terrible if that was the case. The party is for OP. Seems selfish of her sister to be so demanding.", "Wasn't that Michael Jackson's epitaph?", "Even if they didn't book a private room, they are not part of their party.  That is the point. Therefore OP is not responsible for any damages or injuries. \n\nThey are not in OPs party, so they are not OPs problem. If they are in OPs party, then they are responsible for them to an extent.", "I\u2019m a parent and I would never think to bring my kids to an adult party. Adults need time for themselves once in awhile.", "Their behavior is even more strange, then. IDK, enjoy your party!", "Can I come? /s but really, this sounds amazing", "My friend group took one of the girls to Dave and busters for her bachelorette party. We were in our mid 20s at the time. Food, drinks and arcade games for hours. Your party sounds awesome.", "Lol, I connected with this big time, man. If only I could nap without throwing off my sleeping schedule for the next two days...", "My 4yo is mostly definitely not tall enough, not coordinated enough and doesn't have the capacity to understand any of the games.", "Haha, thanks, come on down!", "Lol heck yeah dude, come on out!", "It\u2019s just weird. I\u2019m 36 and unless you\u2019re planning this party for five months time you\u2019re actually older than me and I can\u2019t think of any of my peers post us being age 12 going in for this. This where I\u2019m from is little kiddy stuff, primary school kiddies. My 8 year old would love this, my 13 year old and his friends would think it was equal to waterboarding. Nostalgia would be highschool from 12-16 or late teens early 20s things.", "Good thing you\u2019re not invited then!", "Deffo. That\u2019s the kind of party if my kids get invited to I want to drop and run. It\u2019s probably cultural. Bowling is more an old man\u2019s thing here too so that wouldn\u2019t really fly."]}
