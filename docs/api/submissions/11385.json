Good for you for getting out while the getting was good.", "Late here - but NTA.\n\nI see there is a resolution but please please stick to your guns here. This man is showing signs of incredible toxicity which would turn into gaslighting and isolating you from your friends and family so you can be controlled.

Like I sometimes forget my sister is fluent in spanish but it\u2019s because my family is all white Americans and she\u2019s the only fluent person (we all had classes in school, but it must have only stuck with her). \n\nAnd the post only went downhill from there. Like, again, how do you date someone for 6 years and only tell them your family will want to convert you once you\u2019re engaged.

You need to know each other a lot better before considering this step. Should it be over with Stan? You used the word aggression, so probably. \n\nBut in the future before getting engaged to someone, I you should know how they feel about having kids and raising them. Get on the same page about how to use your money.  Know their feelings on religion and politics. You don\u2019t have to be identical, but you should know if it\u2019s compatible. You should know each others families, especially if they want input on how you run your house. How your potential spouse feels about it. Would they fight for you and your relationship against controlling parents? Same question for you and your family.  And yes, you should know each other\u2019s families before engagement. You need to know if they\u2019re nuts. \n\nAlso, if it\u2019s a surprise to your Spanish speaking fianc\u00e9 that you can speak fluent Spanish, the marriage discussion was way too soon.
