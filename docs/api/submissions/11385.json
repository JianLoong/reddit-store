The parents are TA, but Stan is worse.  I'm not saying a SO needs to be best buddies with their in laws, but they should meet, be cordial, and establish a connection.   The only time a SO and parents shouldn't meet is when the parents have been cut out by their child.", "NTA, but this whole situation sucks.  How do you go 6 years without ever mentioning that you speak Spanish, or that you were adopted by a Spanish family (the two facts go hand in hand).  Your BF sucks for all the reasons, and his family does for not speaking to you directly.  The only thing that would have made this better is if you had said to his parents, in Spanish, that they suck and you're not changing.", "NTA. You don't have to let people taking shit about you in another language know that you understand them talking shit about you.", "NTA\n\nSo many red flags. He refuses to meet your family.

It\u2019s disrespectful for someone to ambush you regarding changing religion. That should be a discussion between you and your fianc\u00e9.

It\u2019s a huge red flag that he won\u2019t meet your parents, they may be your adoptive family but they are still your family. They raised you and I\u2019m assuming are an important part of your life. Any partner that loves and respects you would want to meet the people that helped raise you, especially if you request it.

What they said, in terms of rudeness, \"Shes not right for out son\", \"We cant give out our blessing\" \"She wont even be able to do anything right\" just sound like blanket statements of objection versus anything based on concrete reasoning. As well, it's far more offensive they want you to change your religion and your boyfriend agrees, that definitely makes him TA. As well, why does he refuse to meet your parents?

What are they trying to hide from you? \n\nOP, you've done the right thing by leaving.

You have done nothing wrong.\n\nBut I also want to say it's a MAJOR RED FLAG that he doesn't want to meet your parents unless there's a specific reason why (ex. they are abusive toward you and he doesn't want to be around them because of it ). \n\nI also believe that it is a red flag that he asked you to sit down with his parents without giving you a headsup that they were going to ask you to convert to their religion. You also said that he agrees with them. Has he at any point had a conversation with you that he would want you to convert to his faith in order to have a future with him?", "RUN! NTA.", "NTA- but it would have been awesome if you had said goodbye to them in Spanish.\n\nI am sorry you were treated this way but I am not sure this guy is for you. Just the fact that he refuses to meet your parents is red flag enough. Now he demands you change your faith? \n\nYou will never be good enough for his parents.

Six years together and your partner doesn't know you speak Spanish when his family speak it? And why the heck doesn't he want to meet your parents?! That in itself is a giant red flag! Stop wasting your time and dump him. Why would you even contemplate continuing this 'relationship' ?! Dump him and go enjoy life, you won't regret it.

How could you agree to marriage if he doesn't want to know your family?

As written, the post is so clearly NTA that I\u2019d wonder why they\u2019re even asking.

And think nothing of it?? There\u2019s either stuff OP is not saying, or they\u2019re in the world\u2019s weirdest and unhealthiest relationship and have never had a conversation with their partner/deliberately keep stuff from him.

I'd imagine within the first hour or two of meeting a \"hey, I speak Spanish too!\" would have come up.  Or the fact that OP was adopted by a Spanish family.  None of that EVER came up?  That's....odd.", "sorry i know it sounds odd but he always talked to me in english so i didnt have a need to talk in spanish with him and when i did speak it he wasn't around", "That sounds like a red flag.

Mine would be very concerned if I was planning to spend my life with someone who refused to meet them. I feel like your post exposes much bigger issues than you not disclosing you could speak Spanish. I hope you work all this out and listen to the comments because the whole situation seems pretty toxic.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. These sound like some red flags to me. Seems unfair that he expects you to spend time with his family while they talk poorly about you, but won\u2019t even meet yours or tell you why he doesn\u2019t want to.", "Yeah, let that be a sign to run from this guy. If he agrees with anything and everything his parents say, I have no doubts when they tell him they don\u2019t approve of your nor have their blessing, he will leave you without a second thought", "You do not marry a person who can\u2019t even explain why he won\u2019t meet your parents. That is not something a sane human does. This is not a red flag, it is a giant flashing neon red sign", "Because he thinks they\u2019re white? What I\u2019m not understanding is if his family are borderline racist (sounds like to me) why would he date and ask you to marry him? Stan isn\u2019t ready for marriage you are right with leaving and not looking back. Has he tried to contact you?", "I didnt get that from OP. Neither does OP indicate definitely that stan knows she does though.\nAfter 6 years I presume Stan knows OP speaks Spanish though.", "He\u2019s never met your family or heard you talk to them on the phone?", "Right. If I found out that after 6yrs my partner just never mentioned that they spoke a second language which I *also spoke* and never mentioned it, I would be wondering what else they would be hiding from me. Cause at that point it would feel intentional.", "But it never came up, in 6 years, and with somebody that you live with that you had the ability to speak a whole entire different language not even just in passing conversation?", "In 6 years you never talked about your family or your background?

You don't deserve that. I hope you run asap. ~~But also make a safe plan to do so, as things get more violent when someone tries to leave an abuser.~~\n\nMy bad, I didn't read the last paragraph for some reason. Yeah, stay away from him.", "Omg, I hope you keep yourself safe. Get witnesses or meet in public since \"it does gets violent\". \n\nI don't know if you live with him, but get your most important documents or pets out first. \n\nYou deserve better. No boyfriend should ever refuse to meet your parents or ever get violent.", "Why on earth are you meeting with him?!?!?!?

You should be able to be open and honest with someone you're marrying.  If you've been together that long and he still doesn't know you speak a whole different language you guys probably aren't compatible.", "A lot of things about this relationship don\u2019t make sense or sound like red flags from his part. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know after 6 years that you speak the same language as him and that your adoptive family is Spanish\u2026either you have been weirdly evasive or he does not care about the actual you. There is no way for none of this to come up in 6 years if he cares because why isn\u2019t he asking about your life and childhood and family???\n\nHe won\u2019t meet your family (Um I\u2019m sorry, but what the fuck?)\n\nHe wants you to change your faith for him?\n\nOp this does not sound good."]}
