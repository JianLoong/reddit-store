It may be important to you, but nobody else needs to see it there every day taking up their space.", "ESH \u2026 and hear me out!!!\n\nYour roommate is the AH for building your Lego.\n\nBut you are the AH for slowly (over a number of weeks) keeping a partially built Lego set on a shared dining room table, preventing others from using the table.  In a shared house / apartment situation, it is rude to occupy any space like a table for multiple weeks for some project like that.  Maybe it was a hint from your roommate to finish it and get it off the table.", "The dining table is a shared space. Many people grow up with puzzles out on the table and everyone just works on it a little when you walk by or have a free moment. I\u2019ve never seen anyone do that with legos, but if you put something in a shared space, you kind of have to communicate to your roommates that you don\u2019t want to share it. NAH", "INFO.

Had everyone said ok to jam up the dining room table for weeks with it?", "I think YTA, because you\u2019re using a shared space to do your Lego and don\u2019t want to share. If you don\u2019t want anyone to touch it, put it in your room and let them know.", "YTA if you never discussed not wanting anyone else to touch it. Also, my husband brought home and lego set for him and our kids to do together from a work trip. It took forever to build and drove me crazy on the dining room table for all that time. Perhaps moving it to your room or work table would be better.", "I understand why you are upset and it\u2019s ok to communicate that you intend to build it yourself. But wanting to ID who did it is going too far. Especially since I doubt whoever did it had any bad intent. \nJust break off the piece and rebuild. Also take it away from public space into your room.", "YTA. Put your shit away if you don't want anyone touching it. Honestly, Lego all over the place for weeks gives me hives. Maybe one of your flatmates is sending you a message.\n\nPlus, it's Lego. You're a grown ass adult. Chill out.\n\nEDIT - If this is the 10280 Lego bouquet, what the hell is taking you so long? It's like 760 pieces. My 8 year old could bang that out in an hour. Seems like you've been letting it sit there and your roomies have just had enough of it.", "Sorry, but YTA. Just take it apart and put it back together. That's the point of Lego. You can do that as many times as you want. This is not a real problem.", "Yta you can solve it easily breaking the flower and building again", "Everyone kinda sucks here but I would say YTA- because they made just one half completed flower, it's not like they did the whole thing, THAT would be awful.\nDid you tell your roommates ahead of time that it was important to you to complete the build on your own?\nIs the set in your room, or in a shared space?\nKinda lame of them, but you're overreacting.", "NTA.\n\nBut do take it by apart and rebuild it. It\u2019s not silly to do that. You\u2019re conflating feeling good about building the whole thing with needing to build it first in a virginal state. The latter does not matter in a meaningful way. If you really think about it, it\u2019s simply a way to hang on to your feeling of violation instead of moving forward and erasing the bad feelings and making the LEGO bouquet and it\u2019s construction wholly yours again.\n\nAnd maybe work on it in your room.", "What is the point of lego if you don't enjoy taking it apart and building it again, preferably a little different than before?\n\nI'm sorry, but I really don't get why you are upset. \n\nDo not leave stuff out on shared spaces if you don't want a roommate to finish it. \n\nYTA", "NTA - I was in your shoes - was building a 3d puzzle set and my mate finished it when visiting my house. I was furious and nobody got why so you have my sympaties.", "NTA they should have asked first.\n\nHere it's a rule that whoever gets a lego set or a puzzle is the first one to build it and nobody is allowed to help unless specifically asked to. The joy of discovery is gone otherwise.\n\nJust like it is annoying to play a game and someone behind you is pointing out every next move without being asked.", "NTA.

It\u2019s a small set where you can easily do one flower at at time and put the rest away (which is how I read it, not that you\u2019d left the whole box out for weeks). If you\u2019ve not been putting it away in between then maybe do that from now on, but if it was an issue they should have politely asked you to move it, not helped themselves. \n\n  \n  Totally understand how it\u2019d feel ruined if someone else built it, seems like a lot of commenters don\u2019t build Lego themselves or understand how it works. That\u2019s fine, they don\u2019t need to, it\u2019s your housemates that need to respect the integrity of your belongings. If one of them left their new phone on the table and you peeled the cover off the screen for them and put it back in the box, they would get it.", "ESH. You shouldn't have been taking over the dining room table like that, but they shouldn't have finished your Lego.", " Especially since I doubt whoever did it had any bad intent.", "Agree, ESH unless you had previously got permission from everyone to keep it on the shared table. I also understand the disappointment but demanding to know who did it is honestly over the top, just tell anyone that you don't want your set to be touched and move it to your private space.", "Maybe everyone was fine with the table being used for Lego?", "Anyone who takes apart my LEGO Titanic may as well book a transatlantic crossing and join the real thing.", "Yes. But it was in YOUR house and not a shared space while OP occupied the table for as long as OP desires. That makes your friend the total asshole, while this is a ESH Situation to me. Friend for completing it and OP for thinking its okay to occupy the table for ages because OP is too slow", "If they'd finished it I would vote the same way you did. It was only one flower though and part of a big set left mid progress for days on end on the dining table in a shared space. I'm not sure I'd have been able to contain myself that long if I was their roommate.", "sometimes if i have a friend over when i am gaming they will grab the controller if i\u2019m using the bathroom or something.
