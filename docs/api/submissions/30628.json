No smoking allowed at work, but she smoked in her car on the way to/from work and apparently everywhere else where it was allowed.  She baked personalized cookies once for everyone.

We had to scrape our iced-on names off before we threw them away.", "NTA: But; One of the first things that happens when you start to smoke is you go nose blind to the smell. It\u2019s nearly instantaneous. After years of it you genuinely forget the memory of the smell and it\u2019s off putting and feels dramatic when people express any negativity about it.

If she doesn\u2019t want to gross people out, then she could quit.\n\nIf you rolled around in manure, she wouldn\u2019t want to sit next to you either.", "NTA.

All through school, I reeked of cigarette smoke and had no idea. Once i moved away, I realized how insidious the smell is. That smell permeates everything! I cannot imagine how my dad or my grandparents (all non-smokers) dealt with the stench from the \"fresh\" clean clothes packed for trips!\n\nIf your co-worker was offended by you moving, that's too bad for her. I've worked plenty of places that restricted anything scented due to allergies and cigarette smoke is no different. You were mitigating your physical reaction.
