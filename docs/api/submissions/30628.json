Smokers do not realise how putrid they smell to non smokers, especially after they have just come back from a smoke into a nice fresh environment.", "NTA. I really think she has no idea how much she smells like smoke. She can be upset at you for being honest, but that doesn\u2019t make it your fault that she reeks and is nose-blind to it.", "The smell of cigarette smoke on someone also leaves me feeling like I want to throw up.  Feeling sick because of it is our problem to deal with however the smoker needs to accept that if they stink of cigarette smoke not everyone is going to feel comfortable around them!  They made the choice to smoke and they get to deal with the consequences of it.", "NTA\n\nI worked with a woman who reeked of cigarette smoke.  No smoking allowed at work, but she smoked in her car on the way to/from work and apparently everywhere else where it was allowed.  She baked personalized cookies once for everyone.  They literally tasted like licking a used ash tray.  We had to scrape our iced-on names off before we threw them away.", "NTA: But; One of the first things that happens when you start to smoke is you go nose blind to the smell. It\u2019s nearly instantaneous. After years of it you genuinely forget the memory of the smell and it\u2019s off putting and feels dramatic when people express any negativity about it. Smokers literally don\u2019t know they smell. \n\nOnce you quit though it comes rushing back. I am a former heavy smoker and now I can\u2019t be in the same room as a smoker, it\u2019s so bad.", "NTA. I can't be around anyone who smokes or wears perfume - I get an awful headache and often feel like I can't breathe. I think you were perfectly fine in what you said.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault she smells repulsive. If she doesn\u2019t want to gross people out, then she could quit.\n\nIf you rolled around in manure, she wouldn\u2019t want to sit next to you either.", "NTA.  People who smoke routinely have no idea how offensive the odor is for a non-smoker being around them.  You did the right thing.", "NTA. \n\nNon-smoker, mom & step-dad smoked though. All through school, I reeked of cigarette smoke and had no idea. Once i moved away, I realized how insidious the smell is. That smell permeates everything! I cannot imagine how my dad or my grandparents (all non-smokers) dealt with the stench from the \"fresh\" clean clothes packed for trips!\n\nIf your co-worker was offended by you moving, that's too bad for her. I've worked plenty of places that restricted anything scented due to allergies and cigarette smoke is no different. You were mitigating your physical reaction. Of course you could've continued to sit next to her and potentially vomited, but I'm sure that would only have soured everyone's mood, not just hers.", "NTA.\n\nAs a former smoker, it is easy to get used to the smell.\n\nYou did her the service of reminding her that her smoking makes her smell bad.", "NTA - Who knew cancer sticks had consequences?", "NTA We don\u2019t smell it", "NTA and completely understandable", "NTA but she is.", "NTA I'm very sensitive too and I think you did really well in the situation.\n\nCompanies ban perfume use due to people having sensitivity, I'm all for doing something about cigarette smells, it's gross and I feel like I'm choking when I'm near someone that smells strongly, involuntarily holding my breath.", "NTA - Every adult with any amount of brain knows that smoking makes you stink, particularly to others who do not smoke. She chooses to smoke knowing it makes her smell nasty and that plenty of others will find the smell repulsive. If she doesn\u2019t like people distancing themselves from her due to the stench, she needs to find the will to give up smoking.", "NTA.   \nSmokers stink, and need to be constantly reminded. Don\u2019t feel sorry for her.", "nothing like sitting next to a walking ashtray. NTA", "I used to get offended when I used to smoke cigarettes UNTIL I quit. You truly don't realize how bad the smell is. I totally understand now and you are NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s almost a trigger to mention their smoking to some. I\u2019ve been told in it\u2019s all my head.", "NTA. I think smokers are all putrid losers.", "NTA. Smokers stink to high heaven. They know they reek but still insist on inflicting it on everyone around them. They freely choose to partake , so they can deal with the consequences. For now it's non smokers not wanting to put up with their BO, sooner or later it'll be cancer.", "I am sensative to smells.  If someone stinks badly like cigarettes (I used to be a smoker) or my personal enemy ~ perfume, I avoid them like the plague.  If they have a problem with it, I tell them I would be happy to shower them with my barf to get rid of the smell as it would be a drastic improvement. \n\nI don't hug people due to this, I can't stand it when someone who has put enough perfume on their body to kill an elephant with tries to make me stink too.\n\nSo no,  NTA at all.", "I don't think anyone wants to be told they smell bad.  Next time just say the chair is wonky so you moved over one.", "ESH. If you said it where others could hear, then you humiliated her in a professional setting. However smoke is a strong odour and she needs to at least be aware of it and reduce the smell with mints and lotion. But the time and place for telling her was so wrong.", "Maybe a bit the AH. I get it the smell makes me sick too (and I do aesthetics so it\u2019s extra disgusting to be practically on top of a smoker). My partner sneaks cigarettes and thinks I can\u2019t tell and it gives me a migraine. I wouldn\u2019t have said anything just said \u201cno no it\u2019s not you at all\u201d or said something privately as she might not be aware. It must have been awfully embarrassing for her to have other coworkers hear that, even if they were all probably thinking the same thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know if I've just smoked a cigarette, I'm gonna smell like it. I don't want people to be too close if they're sensitive to the smell. I'm sensitive to certain colognes and body sprays, and I'll move away from those smells. She may be in denial about it. Also, it's worse if she's someone who smokes in her house and/or car. You can never really escape the smell if you're always smoking in enclosed spaces. Makes you smell like an ashtray.\n\nAnd yes, I know it's a terrible habit and I don't really like that my teenage self thought it was a good idea just because everyone else was doing it. I try to be courteous to those around me. But I do also know that smell can linger.", "Nta I smoked for 15 years but I always carried mints and body spray at work so when I returned to the office I could try and mask the smell if she can\u2019t understand some people don\u2019t like the smell of cigarettes that\u2019s her problem as a non smoker now I completely get it it\u2019s a disgusting smell to me now", "What's odd to me is while I don't smoke anything, I do like the smell of most cigars. \n\nBut any cigarette smell makes me want to puke. I wonder if that's common or weird.", "NTA, same with people who wear perfume.", "Nta.\n\nWhen you're trapped in a room with that smell, it can make you nauseated. They generally can't smell it. My dad has been smoke free for over a decade now. He only noticed within the last few years how much the cigarettes stink.", "NTA. Cigarette smoke is pungent and not in a nice way. Price of being a smoker is those with sensitive noses will not want to be in your presence.", "NTA, as an ex smoker the smell of tobacco makes me extremely nauseous. I cringe now when I think that I must have smelled so bad back when I was smoking, and I wouldn't have been offended if someone was sensitive to that smell and moved away", "NTA As an ex smoker I can now smell how bad it is and can't stand it. I have to hold my breath just walking past someone smoking. I can't believe how bad I must have smelled and I'm ashamed I smoked around other people.", "NTA. If she doesn't like smelling of cigarette smoke, she needs to switch to vaping.", "NTA\n\nSmokers cannot smell their own stench. It truly is repulsive and you are not required to put up with that just because a smokers feelings will be hurt.

I get triggered from this smell due to severe childhood trauma so I move like Ussain Bolt, as soon as someone with that smell is near me. They DO smell. All of them. Even the ones doing strange shit to not smell like smoking with gloves on.. It's their whole body that smells, not only the fingers or mouths. If they choose to smoke they have to be okay with people not being okay with the smell. Cold smell or on a hot summer day is even worse to me.\n\nNTA, you shouldn't feel bad at all. No need so say sorry for anything. If she was embarrassed, it's due to her own choice to smoke. Smokers don't need to be called out.. Everyone knows who is a smoker... by the smell at least and other signs", "Not the AITA \nMyself just got done smoking been done 5 months now The smell of cigarettes just give me the yucky", "Maybe next time she won\u2019t stink, maybe she\u2019ll quit.\nAdults shouldn\u2019t pander to adults, speak your truth.", "NTA.

Anyway, NTA! It's a fact that she smells of sigarettes, you're not insulting or embarassing her in any way in my opinion, you're not talking about her body odors or things like that. Not everyone can stand that smell, and we all know it", "They know. The just don't care.", "I once sat next to a guy who smoked a cigarette before he got on the train.

Like how? Everyone that is not smoking can smell that. It's not a secret that she published.", "I was with a girl with long braids over the weekend, the kind you can't wash often.

I did care that I was disgusting though!", "this", "Nobody ever told me I didn\u2019t smell good, in fact people I literally slept with insisted I didn\u2019t smell of cigarettes.

Stopped 3.5 months ago and I knew that it stinks, but not how bad.  \nRecently had a birthday party and a friend slept on my couch.  \nThat mf smoked a cig before I woke up and I almost fainted the next day smelling that sht hungover.", "Yup, I knew that I smelled of smoke but not how bad it actually was because I was so used to the smell of cigarettes/smoking that it smelled like nothing to me, it wasn't untill that I switched to vaping that I knew how bad it was.\n\nBefore I wouldn't bat an eye to another smoker but I now actively avoid them as the smell is just god damn awful and it sticks (which I didn't know was a thing)"]}
