I got so fed up at one point we got into it, but I won\u2019t get into that right now. After that she would do things behind my back, like feed him a whole 2 ounces more with cereal in his bottle while my husband was supposed to be watching him and then blame it on my husband when she accidentally outed herself (and he took the blame).

Your husband is a horrible partner and father to allow his mother to get away with so much. You need to consider making a stand with him on it. He needs to be the one standing up to HIS mother and not force you to have to be the party to do it. \n\nHer advice can be welcomed. But if she refuses to accept you and your husband's stances as THE parents, then she can keep those opinions to herself. She already put one child at risk due to feeding with cereal in milk when it could have been an issue. Will your husband be willing to allow your kids get accidentally given a major allergic reaction to something by her doing something her way?", "NTA, she probably is coming from a place of wanting to help, but you're the parent and have the right/responsibility to make decisions for your child. If you can't trust her to abide by those decisions, then she can't watch the baby.\n\nI appreciate the difficult position you're in though. My MIL watches our baby a day or two a week and there's a few things I've had to put my foot down about (pool not being fenced, safe sleep, etc.). Other things I let slide since I value her help with my child more than controlling that specific thing for my kid (my kid gets more TV time and sugar at my MIL's house than I'd like). You have to find the balance for what you are and are not okay with. Sounds like you're not okay with her comments and actions feeding the baby, so she can't watch the baby until she adjusts or it becomes a non-issue (baby weans).", "NTA anyone that won\u2019t respect your wishes with your child is worthy of being cut off or kept to a distance.  Nutrition isn\u2019t something you can figure out from a distance, she\u2019s just stuck in her ways of thought.", "INFO: But it seems with your first, the child actually WAS hungry? Was the baby getting enough nutrition? It sounds like he was vomiting forcefully and had a milk allergy you were unaware of. Was you MIL the one to spot that your baby didn't seem to be getting enough nutrition? Not sure I'm reading your story correctly ...", "Totally \ud83d\udcaf NTA\n\nMIL overstepped with your son & potentially put him in danger.\n\nYou have every right to protect your daughter until/if you decide MIL is ok to watch her. If you decide no, that's a complete sentence.\n\nYour husband should back you up & not cover for her either. They're his kids too.", "NTA\n\nYour priority is your baby and it\u2019s well-being, not your MIL\u2019s feelings. \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable with her alone with your baby, that\u2019s all that matters. She doesn\u2019t need 101 reasons as to why - No is a complete sentence here.", "Nta she has proven she won't follow your rules and your hubby doesn't have your back.", "NTA she is another of those who cannot respect or follow parental wishes.  Given that is the case, she can't be trusted to watch the children.", "NTA\n\nThat is YOUR child. If she isn't listening to you, then there is no need for her to watch your kid. My mom had a hard time adjusting to my sons allergies when we were told he had over 10+ allegies that are in almost everything. But my mom also asked if this or that was ok and would check on almost everything. Set you MIL straight and if she still doesn't listen, tell her she cant have access.", "NTA. She\u2019s actively trying to undermine your parenting. That\u2019s not helping.", "What\u2019s a mil", "NTA. Your MIL needs to learn boundaries and respect your decisions as a parent. It's not her place to dictate how you raise your child or what she eats. Trust me, I've dealt with similar issues with my own family members and it can be tough but stick to your guns and don't let her manipulate the situation.

She had also had pyloric stenosis as an infant and was familiar with the signs. Although skeptical at first, I came to trust her judgment and asked his pediatrician to check him for it. I was happy she helped in pointing out the problem as to why he wasn\u2019t gaining weight properly and was projectile vomiting. \n\nThe problem with my first was that she decided to hide the things that she did instead of coming to me first and then telling me i starved my child even though we both know he had a health issue. There were other things she did as well. For instance, I was against using baby powder because they can be inhaled and cause health issues and asked her not to use it with him many times. She continued to use it and told my husband that I was pretty much being dramatic. I also asked her not to give him medication that was not meant for infants and young children, and she continued to do so, which could have lead to bigger problems.", "MIL is an acronym for mother in law", "I let her watch my son, but he\u2019s old enough now that he\u2019s outgrown his milk allergy and can eat pretty much anything. The only issue I\u2019ve had recently was cutting his hair. After setting the boundary multiple times, she has finally stopped, so I have no worries concerning him. She cares for him really well and treats him kindly and with love. My daughter is still so dependent though, and there\u2019s so much that can happen in her situation.\n\nAs for my husband, I told him my exact thoughts about his mother and her ways when I found out I was pregnant. I throughly explained what I wanted for our daughter and how I wanted things handled if she overstepped boundaries. He has been way more supportive compared to our first born\u2019s situation, but we are also more experienced with communication with each other and others now as well."]}
