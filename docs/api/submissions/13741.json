{"id": 13741, "submission_id": "128p6pr", "title": "AITA for not wanting BF'S 18 year old coworker to move in with us?", "selftext": "TA account. I (26f) live with my boyfriend (29m) and another roommate in a 2.5 bed apt, for $2k/month. There are 3 \"bedrooms\" but one is tiny and has no closet, although we have had someone live there in the past. Recently he moved out and we have set up bf's drumkit and my art studio in there. \n\nMy boyfriend works with an 18 year old girl (we'll call Ally) who is having difficulty at home with her mom (fighting a lot) and wants to move out. He offered to let her live in the room for $200/month (without asking me or our other roommate). I know and like her, but I have some concerns. I'm trying to figure out whether I'm being a selfish asshole, so I figured I'd post here. \n\nI'm listing this first because I truly think it is the most important. All 3 of us who live here use drugs occasionally. Not weed. It's not all the time but certainly a few times a month, and our roommate hufs nitrous (so dumb, I know) every day. In addition to that, bf and roommate are heavy drinkers. I absolutely do not want to put an 18 year old girl who is already struggling with home life in that environment.\n\nI do have to address that some of my feelings come from just not wanting another person in our space. It's been so nice to have space to set up my art studio, which I know is totally selfish, but I've spent the last few months setting up this room, buying decor, etc. I also like being alone and adding another person just doesn't appeal to me. Also, she's 18, which is just... such a different place in life to be. I don't really want to be around a bunch of 18 year old kids. I know I'm not much older but there's a big difference in an 18 and 25-30 year old. \n\nIn regards to $, bf said he would NOT be deducting the $200 she pays from my and roommates portion of rent (we pay $650 each) and would instead put it aside in a savings account (for him? for Ally? I don't know which). She would not be contributing to any bills.\n\nLastly... I am concerned that Ally living here may negatively impact my relationship with my bf. She's only 18 and I am not worried about him cheating (he's about to be 30), more so that they will constantly hang out (they are close) and I will feel left out.  I visit him at work sometimes and often feel like this while they banter. I know this is my own insecurity and I will do everything I can not to feel this way, but I also know my self and my emotions pretty well, and I can see this making me sad and uncomfortable in my own home. \n\nI know that my bf is a good person and trying to help Ally, but I could keep going with reasons why it would be a bad idea. I have just tried to share what I think is most relevant and also the ones that come up that I think make me the AH. I want to know AITA before I bring this up with BF.", "created_utc": 1680361906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128p6pr/aita_for_not_wanting_bfs_18_year_old_coworker_to/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't sound like this from the outside, based on what you just wrote.\n\nBlatant disregard to your opinion? Check. To your hobbies? Check. Opacity about money use? Check.\n\nIt sounds like he's setting up his sugar baby right under the same roof of his regular GF.\n\nAll your concerns seem valid to me. NTA.", "i was gonna judge you harshly, but calling out your household\u2019s recreational drug use as a potentially hazardous environment for an 18yr old looking to escape her rough home life for the first time?\n\n**super NTA**. i\u2019m not even going to comment on anything else, thank you for being responsible enough to consider *her* health in this!", "NTA - Your BF isn't actually the good person you think he's trying to be. \nFor starters, there's something a little seedy about his intentions here. He could have helped her get her own place in a safe environment, but instead insisted on her having live with HIM in an environment not suitable for an 18yr old surrounded by drugs. \nSecondly, you and your roommates won't be covered for her portion of the rent or the inconvenience. He's using her money for a savings fund? And who exactly is going to be able to access this fund?\nAnd what evidence will you have that he was even charging her rent at all?", "There\u2019s nothing normal about this and I doubt your housemate let\u2019s it\u2019s fly", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t let the age gap fool you. He\u2019s up to something \n\nThe fact that he didn\u2019t ask you or your roommate first: is blatant disrespect\n\n And then to say that her $200 doesn\u2019t contribute to the overall cost of rent. That\u2019s fed up", "So let me get this straight... he offered another person to move in without consulting you on a space that you use, he offered her a discount once again without telling you, he wont even use that money to lower the rent for both of you but wants to keep it selfishly to himself, he hasnt even offered to cover the extra ultities she'll use or have her pay her share, and he hasnt even considered the lifestyle he has may not be suitable a young women who strugging with issues at home? Like this is red flag, problematic behavour galore.\n\n...Girl he is not a good person. That sounds selfish and maybe he wants her close so he has access to her. You are right to not want her there. This isn't even considering the other person who lives there. \n\nNTA I would speak with the other roommate and 3 of you have a convo but honestly for being almost 30 he sounds highly immature and emotionally unintelligent.", "NTA\n\nQuestion: How does your other roommate feel about what bf is trying to pull?", "NTA! You have to put up with a whole other person living with you & it doesn\u2019t even reduce your cost of living?? No, your bf has some kind of hero complex.. if HE wants to help her he needs to figure out another way that doesn\u2019t burden everyone. You don\u2019t offer someone a place to stay without discussing it with your roommates. He is completely out of line.", "NTA at all! I feel it's weird and your bf is up to something.", "NTA. Your bf is not treating you to the minimum of courtesy as a roommate, much less a gf, by moving in a young girl who will be using the house same as you but paying substantially less with that money going to some shady \u201csavings\u201d fund. And please don\u2019t think the age gap makes this innocent - quite likely the opposite. You live there, you have a say. Don\u2019t let bf steamroll you to play the rescuing hero (or worse).", "NTA\n\nLol, your BF wants to move a mistress in with you. He's not a good person at all!", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is obviously moving in a teenage girl whom he's \"close with\" in order to have sex with her right under your nose.  You're in complete denial and this is very sad to see.  Also, be careful with your drug use.  Many people have snorted coke or done molly laced with fentanyl and ended up on autopsy tables.  Don't let that be you.  Your bf needs a slap in the face", "NTA \n\nThe fact that he neither asked you nor your other roommate before just deciding someone else could move in with you is absurd. Perhaps because his name is the only one on the lease he thinks it\u2019s actually his apartment where he can make all the decisions?\n\nThis would be different if she was being abused, but from the way it\u2019s written it doesn\u2019t sound like that. \n\nIt would be better if he tried to help her find a different place. \n\nThe drugs are a major concern, I\u2019m glad you realise that this would be a bad environment for her! Also let\u2019s say she tells one of her friends about your recreational drug use and the wrong person hears it and contacts the cops?\n\nI absolutely get your concerns about her being that much younger, a couple of years make a big difference at that age.\n\nThe whole \u201c200 bucks in a savings account\u201d deal also seems VERY fishy. I get wanting to be nice and not have her pay a lot of rent, but what about utilities? Are you supposed to cover hers too? What about food? \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not worried about him cheating, and maybe you\u2019re right, but 30 year old men wanting to bang 18 year old girls is not something unheard of \n\nBest case scenario: your bf is trying to help his coworker in a big-brotherly kind of way by giving her a place to live and helping her save money (saving the $200 and giving them back later) but is still an ass to you and your other roommate by deciding someone will move in without talking to you first \n\nWorst case scenario: He wants to sleep with his coworker and is making you pay for her utilities and food.", "From a totally different standpoint- if I was the roommate I\u2019d be really pissed about this. your bf invites someone to live there without running it by the roommate, who know nothing about her and hasn\u2019t met her.  She\u2019s only paying $200/month but will increase the water/sewage/electricity bills by having another person there. Who is paying for her groceries? And to boot that $200 is being saved..for what?", "INFO: is your boyfriend the landlord or owner of the home you live in? Or is he grossly overstepping, by assuming he has the right to make unilaterally unreasonable life altering decisions for the other people he lives with?\n\nI think you\u2019re NTA, but I think you have a boyfriend problem - not a potential roommate problem. \n\nEven is he was the landlord he should have consulted his tenants if they were happy to pay for a new roommate. If you\u2019d still be covering all the rent and utilities, and the $200 isn\u2019t counting towards any household expenses, your boyfriend is offering his coworker a free ride at your expense. \n\nThe very fact that your boyfriend could suggest you and your other roommate basically pay for a new roommate, that you were never asked about, indicates where the real problem lies. Does he usually walk all over other people?\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Age gap wise 18 and 25 is about as big as it gets in terms of expectations - she\u2019s entering young adulthood and you\u2019re leaving it.  It sounds like you\u2019re having \u201cgrown up fun\u201d and she needs to be having \u201cyoung adult fun.\u201d She needs to be around either people her own age or people who are fully settled down, like empty nesters whose kids have moved out after college and want to rent out a room.", "Ok from the prospective of a mother, please don't allow that vulnerable child to live with you all.  From the outside looking in, your bf doesn't have good intentions towards her.  If he did he would have talked to both you and the roommate prior to inviting her in.  You don't know the source of the arguments with her mother, could be her hanging with a questionable crowd, such as your boyfriend.  You all already have some issue's, mixing alcohol with serious drugs is not good for you, him and esp. not her.  Also, if the mom really is trying to protect her girl, and she moves in, she will be knocking and calling at your apartment A LOT.  I would be and I'm not kind when it come's to protecting my kids.\n\nNTA", "Darling, he\u2019s cheating on you with the girl or he really wants to.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I know that my bf is a good person\" .. he is not. He is trying to move his sidechick in while expecting you to pay for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd since she gets a room, she sopuld pay at least 25 -33% (Maybe not a full third, since the room is tiny), and she should pay 1/4 of the utilities. Since yoru bf is bringing her in, HE needs to cover her share. So start paying els as soon as she moves in. And prepare moving out, because a breakup needs to come your way. When your bf shows you how he is, believe him. And be grateful you found out before you have kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2She's only 18 and I am not worried about him cheating (he's about to be 30), \" .. How do you figure that? He SURELY does not movve a girl he does not care about into his home, they have an emotional fling at minimum. And the age difference does not keep the bodies from fitting into each other.", "NTA. This is definitely a potential out of the frying pan into the fire type situation for Ally. If he wanted to support her altruistically, he would help her source appropriate assistance. He is displaying some big white knight syndrome, and while I know you think because he is 30 he wouldn't cheat with an 18 yo, I am of the exact OPPOSITE inclination. He already has a potentially overly comfortable relationship with her to begin with, IMO. If he was not trying to cultivate a closer relationship with her, the thought would not have crossed his mind to move her in.", "NTA, and you need to learn to trust your gut. Start with the book \u201cThe Gift of Fear\u201d by Gavin de Becker about learning to trust your gut in unsafe situations.", "Who\u2019s on the lease? If he\u2019s the only one on the lease then it\u2019s his decision. If all of you guys are on the lease then he needs to get everyone approval", ">I'm listing this first because I truly think it is the most important. All 3 of us who live here use drugs occasionally.

I absolutely do not want to put an 18 year old girl who is already struggling with home life in that environment.\n\nProbably time to start evaluating your life choices if your boyfriend abuses substances like this to the point that you think an 18-year-old would be endangered by being around him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I do have to address that some of my feelings come from just not wanting another person in our space.

It's fair for you to bring that up. At the end of the day it is your boyfriend's lease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I don't really want to be around a bunch of 18 year old kids.\n\nYou don't want to be around an 18-year-old but you do want to be around a bunch of alcoholics and drug addicts.

I don't know which). She would not be contributing to any bills.\n\nAgain, it's his lease. You don't have to like it but you don't really have much of a say here. This is the consequence of joining a living situation in which you:\n\n1. Have zero legal say\n2. Apparently did not discuss prior to moving in how much say you'd have in these types of decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Lastly...

This isn't a red flag to you? I'm not even talking about cheating.\n\nYou've given us only a small glimmer into your relationship but it seems like a shitshow. None of your concerns about Ally would exist if your boyfriend wasn't an addict whom you didn't fear will neglect you. ESH but with a heavy lean towards him sucking the most.", "Nah. Talk to him", "ESH except the girl. All of you for being druggies. You recognize its not a good environment for her to move into but you don't seem to think you should stop. Probably should look into it.\n\nOP sucks for being jealous. BF sucks for being clueless.", "NTA. There are two other people in the home that need to be in agreement. Also putting the $200 into savings without discussing it is wrong", "Idk this whole situation just seem sketchy\u2026NTA", "NTA.", "NTA Your boyfriend wants to bring a vulnerable, very young woman into an older drug using environment, when two roommates have not agreed to it.  He isn't sharing the burden of bills and rent by adding a 4th room mate, but is going to pocket all the money for himself and you think he is a good person? The easing of finances is supposed to cover the loss of the art/office type room.", "Um, just because he's older than her that doesn't mean he won't cheat. Plenty of older men have had affairs with much younger partners. And what the hell is he doing with that extra 200? What is even the point of her paying rent if it won't lighten the load off you and your other roommate? Sounds like he'll be stuffing his pockets with that money. This is a recipe for disaster. NTA", "NTA - everything you said is absolutely reasonable. If your relationship is strong and full of trust and communication this should not affect your relationship", "I feel like it\u2019s just a matter of time before BF asks for a threesome.", "Gf is really trying to appear reasonable towards the person she's dating instead of admitting he's a jerk. Hope she wakes up, this dude is not a good guy.\n\nTotally got mistress vibes as well. Plus the way he's pretending like what he's doing is 'not a big deal.'", "I was in a similar situation around 20, moved out of my parents house into a bad environment, which is probably why I'm still doing these things/living in this situation now. It took me a long time to get out of it and I'm still working to overcome addiction. I don't want anyone to go through what I went through, and she really is such a nice girl. I know she has some psychological/trauma issues that I think would make her susceptible to using if put in the environment. I genuinely care about her, and I'm conflicted because I know some of the reasons I'm against this are selfish, but this is truly the main priority for me.", "Agree,  NTA", "thank you. I am trying. I do test and I keep Narcan in the house. I would like for the drug use to stop altogether. but feeling pretty powerless :(", "I truly believe he is trying to seem like a big brother and doesn't have more nefarious plans, but I still worry about that happening. maybe I'm just jealous and insecure. but I was also once a vulnerable teenager who thought older men were looking out for my best interests. they never actually turned out to be.", "Thats something I wanted to include but couldn't due to character limit.

She seemed nice to me but I guess you never know what goes on in other people's homes. I will say from everything bf has said it doesn't seem like an abuse situation.

I knew I would get this response and was reluctant to post because of it. Yes, I know. I'm not proud of the fact that I use substances. I am working on it, it's been a long road. I was unfortunately in a similar situation at her age which is what got me into where I am now. I'm trying my best. addiction is hard.

Not an AH. But very naive. There is no way that an affair isn't brewing here. He is being a terrible partner and a terrible roommate. And he is not behaving in an appropriate way toward this young girl if he is encouraging her to move into a home with two much older men who regularly use drugs in the home.

As is staying in a relationship with an active user who disregards your needs and opinions and does shady things with money.", "Ah yes. A vulnberable teenager should absolutely live in a box room, surrounded by heavy drinking, drug taking adults. Such a safe and supportive environment! He knows how he chooses to chill, and she'll be right there hanging out. A troubled and impressionable young girl. If he can afford to not charge her proper rent, he can afford to help her out as she settles elsewhere. Ideally with her peers and ideally not a bunch of junkies.", "He's clueless as to why his GF is upset, at least that's what I got from the story. But maybe he just doesn't care. Either way the BF is an AH. But so is OP.", "that was my plan. it could potentially be a great thing if it encouraged us to all have better habits and make a better environment. I obviously don't WANT to be doing drugs, and I've been working a lot on self control. but until we have ALL proven that we can create and maintain that environment I am uncomfortable with it. I would love to no longer use. It's very hard when it's in your environment, and this has been an issue with me and bf before, because I am trying to stop, and it continues to be put in my environment. as much as I know this is a problem with MY self control, addiction is... really hard. and if he's willing to quit for her but not me.... I guess that says something too. I'm not trying to say I'm completely innocent, I'm a grown adult and make my own choices. but I wouldn't be doing this if I wasn't around it. I stopped for a while, so I wouldn't even know where to get them if bf and rm didn't bring them around. I know everyone's gonna tell me to dump him :/ like most things, it's more complicated than what's on the surface.", "lol, he's playing dumb!", "well, we haven't fully had a conversation about it yet, so he hasn't shown he is totally dismissive of my feelings YET. he texted me about it a few days ago. I tried to talk to him about it last night but he said he didn't want to discuss it when he was drunk (I know you guys are going to tell me to throw the whole boyfriend out). I texted him today (he's at work) and told him we need to discuss it before any thing else happens. we'll see."]}
