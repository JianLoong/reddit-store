It is not helpful to encourage her, especially since the guy seemed a bit blindsided at the thought. If she doesn't calm down, bf is gonna bolt before proposing. She needs to get the proposal before planning anything. Her focus is 1 step ahead of where it needs to be... I'm just imagining her with multiple notebooks... one for a wedding, babies, anniversaries.... all while he's chilling on the couch, happy with things exactly how they are. None the wiser. She's fixated on the goal but ignoring the process of how to get there. And, it doesn't sound like she's discussing any of this with the 1 person she should... the bf. \n\nTell your wife you are happy her friend is happy, but it's not possible to be happy for an event that requires 2 people be on board with, when 1 of them has no clue about it. - assuming from how he reacted to your joke.", "NTA, this is odd behaviour, it sounds like she wants a wedding more than she wants a husband", "NTA\n\nJust a warning, though?\n\nDo NOT let your wife hear you laughing for 5 minutes straight when the friend gets dumped in the next few weeks. \n\nYou still won't be the AH, but your wife will NOT see it that way.", "She wants a dream wedding day not a marriage. Based on how you said her bf reacted it doesn't seem likes she's getting one anytime soon", "NTA.\nThis kind of obsession is dangerous as it can lead to resentment if that guy never pops the question. She (the friend) needs to discuss her expectations with her boyfriend before it spirals any further. \n\n Your wife needs to stop enabling that behaviour ( its going to be messy if he doesn't want to tie the knot or subscribes to the extravaganza the friend is wanting and building herself up to wanting.) She won't want to hear that, hence the looks she is giving you but it stands the other couples relationship the best chance of surviving and if she values that she has to stop fuelling the fire. Don't get me wrong, thinking about these things and a bit of a chat is a nice thing, but sounds like it hit that limit a while back...\n\nIncidentally, if the friend's relationship does implode, you may want to take a trip away, quickly in order to attain minimum safe distance. Good luck op", "NTA. Your wife's friend is wayyyyyyy too focused on this hypothetical wedding than actually being sure she wants that wedding to be with a man she'll actually want to be married to for life / a long time.

I just wonder if she does get married, if she's just going to feel like a deflated balloon with no purpose now that the wedding is over. I guess then she'll have to focus on babies.", "I can see why this woman isn't married yet - she has likely scared off all the men in the past. \n\nIt could have been a case of no \"formal\" proposal having been made, but judging by your conversation with the guy, that doesn't appear to be the case. \n\nI suspect you are right - there won't be a wedding between these two.", "Are you excited for the promotion she might receive at one point later in life too? \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA.

They seem obsessed with an imaginary wedding.", "NTA, and I\u2019m wondering if this is the reason for her failed attempts. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to fantasize about your someday-wedding, but this is crossing into \u201cactually planning\u201d territory and no one needs this level of pressure. \n\nLikewise, you\u2019re not the bad guy for not caring about issues that may never actually become issues.", "NTA\n\nI guess you have to be a bit tactful with your wife when she brings the subject up.\n\nI don't think the friend's \"wedding\" is likely to happen though. The BF is likely to run, run, run far as fast as he can.", "It's normal for women to have a vision of their dream wedding, but to start planning a date and budget for it before an engagement is even forthcoming is kind of creepy.  Clearly the \"groom-to-be\" isn't in on the plan.  Maybe the reason she is still unmarried is because she has scared off previous partners.  It might have been a bit sarcastic, but there's nothing wrong with what you said to your wife about it.

It's not the marriage. The marriage is the multiple days over multiple years, hopefully until the day one of you dies.\n\n56 years later, mom doesn't overly remember the wedding unless she's watching the video or looking at photos. But she remembers the marriage.\n\nYour wife's friend is placing all her focus and care on a wedding (not even _the_ wedding, just _a_ wedding), while completely ignoring the fact it's not what a marriage is. A marriage is not one day. She seems like the kind of person to whom the wedding is all, and doesn't actually care about anything else. The groom doesn't even really matter, the groom could be anyone. She doesn't care about a marriage, she cares about a wedding, which is absolutely the wrong thing to care about.\n\nNTA.", "Has the friend ever seen the movie 'A Streetcar Named Desire'?
