Sounds like that was the only solution to keep Uncle Phil from getting plastered and ruining the reception short of having a dry reception or not inviting him. It's better than your family's normal policy of just ignoring or, as it turns out, enabling it.", "NTA straying towards ESH, you should have told him not to come if he needs to drink. It would have been a horrible conversation but it needed to happen. I get why you didn't though. And as a bartender it's nothing weird to be told to cut someone off. A bartender always has to have a little bit of a babysitter in them.

You had to know something like this was going to happen.", "NTA.You do not enable addiction. People can have opinions about it all they want from the outside but you control the bar here and he wasn't allowed in because you knew what would happen.

You attempted to preserve his dignity. He decided to raise a stink and involved others. Definitely NTA. Definitely not your problem. He's the alcoholic. Other people haven't lived with that and don't know that so they sided with him. Some people don't even invite family members like this to stuff anymore. Consider that. It was a privilege for him to be there at all.", "NTA. \n\nWe had a dry wedding due to alcoholics on both sides. \n\nBut I will add that it could have been handled better.

And you\u2019re not obligated to enable and support him being an alcoholic and/or possibly drinking & driving, and/or making a fool of himself at your wedding.", "ESH\n\nYou just might be a bit controlling. \n\nI can understand not wanting your wedding to devolve into chaos after the family alcoholic drinks several too many bourbons, but is it really up to you to control what your uncle does? I'd say it isn't. Besides, most alcoholics keep a bottle on them, or know where to find one. I'm kinda surprised he didn't have a flask. \n\nAfter the Stasi comment, however, I'd suggest having Tom's dad over for Thanksgiving sometime to see Uncle Phil in action.

I did.", "YTA for not telling him ahead of time and putting that on the bartender. Is there any particular reason you didn\u2019t talk to him about it beforehand?

What were you thinking?\n\nYes, your family has chosen an odd way to handle the situation, but you don't have to be part of the problem.  I suppose you deserve the benefit of the doubt so perhaps your family's head-in-sand policy has normalized this for you to such an extent you weren't thinking clearly.  Do NOT continue to do this. Tell your uncle you'll be there to support him however you can when he's ready to get help, but you don't have to support his addiction.

It was a complete AH move and told the bartender to basically say \u201csorry, you\u2019re a drunk, none for you!\u201d This wouldn\u2019t have been an issue at your wedding. Him confronting your parents instead of you was actually respectful for the position he was unknowingly put it. You\u2019re the one who made drama at your own wedding.

You should\u2019ve had a conversation with him beforehand, and probably shouldn\u2019t have invited him to the wedding, and told him EXACTLY why. Hard boundaries and missing things like weddings are often the wake-up calls that alcoholics need. \n\nAnd bartenders simply don\u2019t get paid enough to babysit the drunk uncle all night.

So once they knew he was an alcoholic, it may have been their actual job to not serve him, and they may have been trained to handle such a situation. \n\nAlthough I agree with everyone that OP could have probably anticipated this reaction. But based on the way the family treats the alcoholism, I don\u2019t know that OP had many good options. I don\u2019t think discussing it in advance would have caused less drama. \n\nAlso, are we going to hold a grown man accountable for making a scene at OP\u2019s wedding? Or the rest of the family for enabling? The only reason OP handled it this way was because they knew they weren\u2019t going to get any help from the family. \n\nSo my vote is ESH.", "I think this is the best comment.\n\nEdit to add I have my share of alcoholics in my family.

For one, being excluded and blindsided caused your uncle to complain to relatives. For another, chances are uncle would've asked someone else to order for him and being handed the drink.

I get you wanted to do the right thing, but not serving him at your wedding isn't going to make him suddenly quit. And as you realise now, it didn't avoid a scene if that was your motivation. Did you talk to your parents about this plan to see what insights they have? They've been dealing with this and him longer than you and their input would have been of significant value.", "YTA - just don\u2019t invite the guy instead of embarrassing him in front of the entire place.

The best man kept calling the bride by the wrong name.\n\nTom is old enough to know his mind and that's what's important to you.  Ignore MIL and FIL.

Your uncle is an adult and can make his own choices. Yes, they\u2019re shitty, and yes, it places a burden on the people around him, but the appropriate response to not wanting to deal with that is to not invite him to the wedding.

Not only is that horribly irresponsible that is potentially dangerous for both of them. Addiction is a mental illness and it is not just an obsession over their vice, their entire personality can change.", "YTA because you put that bartender in a really awkward position. I get you're trying to help, but only your uncle can help himself. You can't control an addict and you shouldn't try. Also you may not realise this but your uncle's withdrawal shakes mean he has alcohol dependency - which means he actually *has* to drink or he could genuinely die. Withdrawal, and particularly delirium tremens (of which shakes are a symptom) can be fatal.", "YTA for not warning him beforehand and instead causing him to be incredibly embarrassed. You should have given him the agency to choose not to come or at least avoid the bar so he didn't have to go through being the only person denied a drink.\n\nIt was also super shitty of you to put that on the bartender. Their job is to serve drinks, not to bear the brunt of your uncle's anger and embarrassment because you couldn't be bothered to communicate with him. I really hope they were paid well.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA but I understand where you\u2019re coming from. My partner has a cousin and an uncle with alcohol problems. Both have caused issues at previous weddings and brought booze to dry weddings. We decided not to invite them to ours due to their previous behavior. It sucks but we shouldn\u2019t have to babysit obscenely drunk relatives on our wedding day and neither should our guests. \n\nYou or your family should have talked to him about it before the reception so he wouldn\u2019t be blindsided by the bartender and feel embarrassed. It\u2019s also not fair to the bartender to have to do that for you. I don\u2019t think your husband\u2019s family should have gotten involved either though. I think you should reach out to your uncle and apologize for you how you handled the situation but I don\u2019t think you owe your husband\u2019s family anything. They got involved in a situation that isn\u2019t really their business.", "My restaurant had a rehearsal dinner a few weeks ago. We had multiple people, including the guy\u2019s wife, discreetly tell us that he was an alcoholic and my bartender and the rest of us working the party had to pretend to serve him.

This also solves the letting the bartender handle it issue.", "not wrong, but still shitty to put that on anyone else but the op\n\neither see it through like an adult or don't invite them. In either scenario it needs to come from the op given it is their day", "I\u2019m a bartender and honestly I don\u2019t think I would be allowed to do this (legally). I am not allowed to discriminate. Unless they\u2019re drunk. Then I can refuse service. Bride is a major AH for being a chicken shit and making service staff deal with this. \n\nI\u2019m also sorry you had to deal with this. Did your manager know what was going on?", "I\u2019ve never heard this about a known alcoholic. At least in my very blue state, this isn\u2019t covered as part of dram shop laws, which are pretty tight here. Now, if said alcoholic confessed he was already intoxicated, or he told me he\u2019s been crushing beers all day, that\u2019s a different story. I can\u2019t refuse service because of a medical diagnosis (including pregnancy), but I can monitor how much I serve him and observe his behaviors to determine if he\u2019s intoxicated.", "I think in this situation, I\u2019d ask another family member, maybe one who doesn\u2019t drink, to be there as part of the conversation, and then at the wedding. That family member can then go to the bar with your dad, at least the first time or two, and tell the bartenders, with your dad there, not to serve him alcohol. \n\nThen they can deny him without being the bad guy. There is no miscommunication, and there\u2019s another party hopefully willing to help take the pressure off you. I\u2019d gladly not drink for the night if it meant helping keep the wedding smooth by keeping an eye on an alcoholic.", "YTA from here too because you made the bartender to deliver the message. You should've had the spine to deliver it yourself. \n\nAlso, you could have instead instructed the bartender to serve very mild drinks. Withdrawl symptoms are real, why did you want him to experience that in your wedding? \n\nYou could have also remembered that alcoholism is an illness and alcoholics are humans and deserve to be treated accordingly. There was no need to humiliate him with a surprise no booze rule from the bartender.", "I like how many commenters are standing up for the bartenders. Respect service workers, OP.", "ESH.  Look, you need to stop inviting your uncle to places.  He gets delegated NOTHING.  It is not up to the bartender to police your uncle's drinking.  Quit asking him to bring the turkey.\n\nYou and your in-laws have a whole other set of issues to work with, but you have two choices.  Start excluding your uncle from family events or let him come and embarrass himself.  You can't stop him from drinking, but you can start changing how you deal with the situation.", "YTA.  You should've either told him he wouldn't be allowed to drink, or uninvited him to the wedding.  It was not fair of you to leave this task up to the bartender.  It's not up to the bartender to make that decision unless he's too drunk to serve.", "YTA\n\nPeople have the right to undo themselves whichever way they wish. Drunk person at party? Shocker! But that's the time when you simply throw them out, put them in a cab and send them on their way.", "YTA be a big girl and have the tough conversation yourself instead of being so cowardly that you decide to set some poor bartender up as your uncle's punching bag.", "Isn't is also medically dangerous for a heavy alcoholic to go into withdrawal?", "Frankly that's a victory/s make him drink in the most pathetic way possible, it's a lot easier to realize youre n addict when you have to behave like one, frankly his family has obviously given this guy an open bar a few times too many to learn the lesson and then chose to handle it in the worst way possible lmao, hand it off to the service worker lmao.", "Congrats on your sobriety but you are missing the point. \n\nThis bride put an innocent bartender, who was just there to serve drinks in the middle of her family drama. The person did not deserve that.\n\nShe should have been the one to tell him he would not be served alcoholic drinks, or better yet since she's claiming she only invited him because of her mom she should have explained it to her mom and had her mom tell her uncle. \n\nIt was her responsibility, not that of the bartender. Whether he would have brought something or not is something else *she* should have had a plan for. What if he had gotten aggressive with the bartender? What then??", "I feel like discussing it in advance probably would have led to him drinking ahead of time and showing up drunk. I think you're right that this was a shitty situation with pretty much no options that didn't involve blowback. Personally speaking I think I would have bit the bullet and not invited him.", "Yes it is but a 2 hr wedding won\u2019t cause DTs. The more dangerous situation is the bartenders not being informed that they were the ones telling him he wasn\u2019t getting anything.", "And your point? Any adult whose been told by family that his drinking is a problem, should not have been surprised when he was not allowed to drink at family functions. The bartender I'm sure has had this experience more than once. And was paid to do it."]}
