That person did not deserve to be put in that position by you. \n\nSo for that YTA", "You cannot expect a bartender at a wedding to be your uncle\u2019s babysitter for the night.  Have a dry wedding or even smarter don\u2019t invite your uncle.", "Sorry, YTA. The right solution would have been to not invite him.\n\nYou know that he'll either get drunk or aggressive There's no way you can have him there without problems.\n\nYou might get pushback on leaving him out but everybody already knows how he is.", "Eh that\u2019s a double edged sword. Not for refusing alcohol to him but you are YTA for not letting him know. He could have made the decision to drink before hand or to not come but it wouldn\u2019t have caused a scene. You also left the bartenders to fend for themselves dealing with an alcoholic who was expecting liquor. That was wrong on so many levels. It could have become a dangerous situation.", "INFO\n\nDid you tell Uncle Phil there wouldn\u2019t be alcohol available to him at your wedding ahead of time? If he\u2019s physically dependent he would need to assess whether he could safely go that long without drinking beforehand without a seizure or DTs.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nYou had an open bar, which meant all of your other guests could have alcohol, if they wanted.\n\nYour uncle is an alcoholic, which meant he would of course want to use the open bar.\n\nYou didn't have the conversation with him ahead of time and left that tricky conversation to strangers (bartenders), with nothing to guarantee how delicately they would have handled the conversation or how comfortable they would be having that conversation on your behalf. From my experience, bar tenders tend to be people aged between 18 and 30 (I'm in the UK), and your uncle is 58. That's not an easy confrontation, especially for someone on the younger side of that range.\n\nIf you felt you had to invite your uncle, it was up to you to have that conversation with him first. At least then he could save face by not going to the bar or sitting out of the wedding reception.\n\nHe did well by not bringing this to you on your wedding day, so you should apologise to him for how you handled it.\n\nYou're not wrong for not wanting him to drink at the wedding, by the way. Just in how you handled it. Hope your uncle can get the help he needs. Alcoholism is a horrible, sad disease.", "If you never told your uncle beforehand then YTA. You are an adult have an adult conversation. Because you didn't you had a scene at your wedding.", "YTA and a very manipulative one at that. If you don't like the way your uncle loses control, simply do not invite him! Explain to him the reason is that he gets drunk and disrespects his hosts. Why put childish restrictions on what he cannot consume as a guest, it just makes you look like a grubby host.", "Hard YTA. You should have told your uncle Phil not to drink if you didn't want him to drink and asked the bartenders to try and be conscious of not overserving while understanding that's not their job if they did by mistake.", "Did you tell him he wouldn\u2019t be able to drink, and that you instructed the bartenders not to serve him?", "NTA.

You should have told them he was their responsibility if they wanted him to drink.", "NTA \n\nFrom what you described Uncle Phil sounds like a nightmare and a bloody liability because his alcoholism hasn't just affected his life, but everyone around him including yours\n\nsure you can't control someone's drinks, but your reasons are justified because he ruins things, he ruined Thanksgiving, and everyone it appears enables him to the point of having a backup turkey! \n\nhis wife left him (good on her) and what would happen if he got drunk, then violent, and yes your family had an intervention, which didn't work because he doesn't want to change his ways \n\nforget the naysayers you did the right things \n\nand congrats on the wedding", "NTA. Sounds like that was the only solution to keep Uncle Phil from getting plastered and ruining the reception short of having a dry reception or not inviting him. It's better than your family's normal policy of just ignoring or, as it turns out, enabling it.", "NTA straying towards ESH, you should have told him not to come if he needs to drink. It would have been a horrible conversation but it needed to happen. I get why you didn't though. And as a bartender it's nothing weird to be told to cut someone off. A bartender always has to have a little bit of a babysitter in them. Also your In-laws sounds like they had a problem with you before this or why else would they have taken the side of the person that's mad at the bride?", "NTA but why would you even invite him? You had to know something like this was going to happen.", "NTA.You do not enable addiction. People can have opinions about it all they want from the outside but you control the bar here and he wasn't allowed in because you knew what would happen. I'd say it was a lot more polite than putting a sign up with his face saying don't serve that man. Does he want that? You can start doing it at any event where you pay for the bar. You attempted to preserve his dignity. He decided to raise a stink and involved others. Definitely NTA. Definitely not your problem. He's the alcoholic. Other people haven't lived with that and don't know that so they sided with him. Some people don't even invite family members like this to stuff anymore. Consider that. It was a privilege for him to be there at all.", "NTA. \n\nWe had a dry wedding due to alcoholics on both sides. \n\nBut I will add that it could have been handled better. But hind site is always 20/20 and you had a full plate planning a wedding.", "Nope, NTA. Your wedding, your rules. And you\u2019re not obligated to enable and support him being an alcoholic and/or possibly drinking & driving, and/or making a fool of himself at your wedding.", "ESH\n\nYou just might be a bit controlling. \n\nI can understand not wanting your wedding to devolve into chaos after the family alcoholic drinks several too many bourbons, but is it really up to you to control what your uncle does? I'd say it isn't. Besides, most alcoholics keep a bottle on them, or know where to find one. I'm kinda surprised he didn't have a flask. \n\nAfter the Stasi comment, however, I'd suggest having Tom's dad over for Thanksgiving sometime to see Uncle Phil in action. Seat them together.", "Reddit is so black and white about stuff sometimes. Family is complicated, yes you shouldn't have invited him, yes you should have told him yourself about the no alcohol for him policy, yes you could have handled it better, but I don't fault you for not doing it better.  It's your wedding, you wanted it with the least amount of conflict possible, no headaches, etc. The bartenders are more than used to dealing with drunks,", "No, but he always has alcohol on him. Flasks, it's in whatever mug he brings in his truck, glove compartment, under the seats, etc. He also could've stepped outside and gone to multiple bars or a liquor store if needed.", "If you made the bartenders break that to him, YTA for knowingly putting them in that position.", "I didn't tell him ahead of time, no.", "I agree. But by not warning the uncle ahead of time OP ran the likely risk of creating a volitile situation. She basically screwed over the unsuspecting bartenders.", "He's my mom's only sibling and I'm his only niece. I can't imagine that conversation being any easier.", "They should have informed him ahead of time that he would not be served alcohol. He went to a wedding knowing there would be an open bar. He probably wouldn\u2019t have come had he known.", "INFO: why the hell did you even invite him?", "NTA \n\nYour uncle sounds very sick and it\u2019s a very sad situation. I\u2019m glad he at least didn\u2019t bother you and your husband during the wedding. I think your Uncle\u2019s anger might be mostly humiliation and that\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t spoken to you directly. I think you have his best interests at heart, more so than his enablers. Personally if there\u2019s another party you throw I would reach out with compassion to let him know in advance that alcohol isn\u2019t an option at your events.\n\nAddiction is a monster and I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s effecting you. Congrats on your wedding and I hope you have a blessed marriage!", "And that\u2019s why you\u2019re the a hole. The bartenders were thrown to the wolves bc you didn\u2019t want to confront him ahead of time. Your uncle could have attacked someone for not serving him at an open bar.", "If you get in a public shouting match with a bartender at a wedding because you aren\u2019t being supplied with alcohol, you have a problem and you are the problem.", "I get it and I\u2019m not trying to lay into you or anything. I just always try to advise people to take the path of least resistance when it comes to toxic family members, having extensive experience with it.", "Oh sure. The uncle is a huge problem. But if you\u2019re an alcoholic and know there\u2019s an open. Ar you expect alcohol. Op should have let him know in advance. She put the bartenders in danger. That\u2019s on her. And could have been a lawsuit had one of them gotten injured. The victim\u2019s lawyer would have a field day with that one. \u201cSo OP you knew your uncle was an alcoholic and was expecting an open bar?\u201d Yes. \u201cDid you ever tell him he wouldn\u2019t be served?\u201d No. \u201cDid you tell the bartenders he would be expecting alcohol but you were denying service due to alcoholism?\u201d No. \u201cSo you blindsided them and let them find out on their own there would be a potential threat towards them due to him not knowing and expecting alcohol?\u201d Well that wasn\u2019t the anticipation. \u201cPlease answer the question.\u201d Yes. I did.", "YTA for not telling him ahead of time and putting that on the bartender. Is there any particular reason you didn\u2019t talk to him about it beforehand? If you were worried about him throwing a fit over it, wouldn\u2019t it have been better to have it happen before the wedding rather than during?", "YTA. Why invite him? He's toxic.", "Easy YTA, you put that bartender in a really awkward situation, honestly that's shameful cowardice and lack of consideration for another person.", "YTA. Not for the rule but for not telling your uncle about it in advance.", "So you put all of your guests at risk by planning for him to drink and drive?!?\n\nI thought YTA for not communicating this to him in advance and leaving it to the bartenders, which was a jerk move, but then you made it even worse. \n\n There was just recently a bride killed by a DD leaving her own wedding. What were you thinking?\n\nYes, your family has chosen an odd way to handle the situation, but you don't have to be part of the problem.  I suppose you deserve the benefit of the doubt so perhaps your family's head-in-sand policy has normalized this for you to such an extent you weren't thinking clearly.  Do NOT continue to do this. Tell your uncle you'll be there to support him however you can when he's ready to get help, but you don't have to support his addiction. And for the love of all that is holy, maybe don't invite him to any future kid's parties unless or until he's sober!"]}
