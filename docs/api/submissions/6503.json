I\u2019ve recently started trying to read more and I saw a book recommendation online, I noticed my brother reading the same book a few days earlier and instead of buying one online I thought I\u2019d just ask him if I could borrow his, he said he\u2019d finished reading it and to go ahead but just return it when I\u2019m finished. There was no problem with this on either end. Anyways I was reading the book in the living room, my brother came in, no problem. I folded the paper over to keep the page and as I was doing that he looked over and started shouting at me for bending the page, he grabbed the book from me and stormed upstairs and slammed his door, I followed him up to see why it was such a big problem but he continued to scream at me for \u201cruining\u201d his books, I\u2019ve always done that with books and I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s bad, I get that he likes his books but jeez.", "created_utc": 1672877310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103jq3v/aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_book/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like you've learned the hard way. To you, it's a non-event; to your brother, the book is now genuinely ruined. I vote NAH since you genuinely didn't know.

You don't fold pages of books that belong to you. Now go buy him a replacement.", "YTA I would make you replace it. This is such a hard line for almost anyone that collects books.", "Slight ESH. You need to respect other people's belongings and the book collecters don't like dog earing the pages at it eventually ruins the book. \n\nYour brother could have explained to you in a better way to not do that rather than spiralling out. Dog earing pages is usually normal and not everyone value books as much as a collector do.", "YTA... I dog ear pages, but with someone else's books, I would never, even if i noticed that the pages were already dog-eared", "YTA. Ever heard of a bookmark?", "YTA.

Every personal librarian has different standards - for me, I like dogearred pages particularly if it was me that made the mark on a previous read, but others want their books pristine. Books can really be sacred objects for some. \n\nThat said, there should be a conversation about the expectation of how you return someone\u2019s property. You suck because you are not returning something the same or better than you found it. He sucks for not communicating and reacting the way he did.", "YTA you dont dogear a book that isnt yours.", "ESH you shouldn't dog ear pages on books that aren't yours but he could of just asked nicely not to do that and it would have been fine", "YTA along with everyone saying ESH.

As a bibliophile, you committed a heinous crime against books!\n\nIn all seriousness, you should return an item in the same condition it was borrowed.

It is his property after all. If he doesn\u2019t want a corner folded then a corner shouldn\u2019t be folded.

It's not your book to bend pages on.\n\nI used to do this thing in middle school, where if someone would lend me their mechanical pencil I would snap the clip because I'd always do it with my pencils out of habit.

I\u2019ve recently started trying to read more and I saw a book recommendation online, I noticed my brother reading the same book a few days earlier and instead of buying one online I thought I\u2019d just ask him if I could borrow his, he said he\u2019d finished reading it and to go ahead but just return it when I\u2019m finished. There was no problem with this on either end. Anyways I was reading the book in the living room, my brother came in, no problem. I folded the paper over to keep the page and as I was doing that he looked over and started shouting at me for bending the page, he grabbed the book from me and stormed upstairs and slammed his door, I followed him up to see why it was such a big problem but he continued to scream at me for \u201cruining\u201d his books, I\u2019ve always done that with books and I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s bad, I get that he likes his books but jeez.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. I\u2019m not a reader and I still know not to do that", "YTA \n\nThat is damaging someone else\u2019s property. Even if you do something everything doesn\u2019t mean other people have to like it. He kept them in pristine condition for 10 years and you ruined it. \n\nI hope you apologize.", "YTA you don\u2019t dog-ear someone else\u2019s book. Use a book marker. You can literally stick any small piece of paper in there to hold your spot without folding the pages. I have books as old as 120 yrs. Please show respect for your brothers collection. Apologize and if needed, purchase the replacement.", "YTA You could have used any scrap piece of paper as a bookmark.", "YTA and really don't understand how someone can cherish a book.\n\nYou didn't bookmark it or even dog-ear the page. You folded the whole page in half like it was a Danielle Steele novel. I wouldn't let you get near my books.", "Oooooooo alls I can think of is if I did this my dad would be so mad! I am not a big reader but my dad looooooooves books, any time I did get a new book he would remind me \u201cbooks are precious! Pleeeease don\u2019t dog ear them, the corners will fall off!\u201d So yeah, on behalf of my dad, YTA.", "YTA, if you borrow something it should be returned in the condition you received it in, regardless of how you treat your own possessions.", "ESH.

Just use a bookmark from now on.", "NTA-it\u2019s clear to me that you didn\u2019t know that he doesn\u2019t like this. He could have acted more calmly, so he\u2019s the AH for his behavior, but in the future, you need to ask before doing this. Some people don\u2019t mind and some do and I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re supposed to know if you\u2019re not told or don\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t like dog-earing books. I\u2019d be annoyed about it-but I know how to handle it without disrespecting you.", "absolute insanity in these replies. NTA", "YTA \n\nI read a lot but I don\u2019t collect books, I turn down corners in my books but I\u2019d never going to do to someone else\u2019s book. I do collect funko pops and marvel legends though and I would be pissed if someone damaged them.", "Gentle YTA. As an avid book reader, and in that category of \"you ruin my book, you buy me a new one\", the dog-earing of a page has never bugged me, however a single page having a rip or slight tear would send me on the rampage. OP genuinely didn't know, and she did learn the hard way that it's frowned upon at the very least by her brother. However, the \"it's not a big deal\" attitude doesn't do OP any favors. Just because you don't understand doesn't mean that it's not upsetting to the owner of the book. Go apologize!", "Yeah YTA / ESH\n\nHe overreacted, but many librophiles are very against damaging the books they read because they like them also as decor. \n\nApologize, admit that you didn't realize he cared for his books so well (DO NOT criticize him about it), and offer to replace it as an apology. He might not even want it replaced, and may calm down about it, but it would be the nonahole move.", "NTA. It was an accident. I absolutely LOVE to read, and I do that to my books sometimes.", "YTA. You are so utterly the A in this situation that there are no words. This is somebody else's property, and you are doing physical damage to it. You may not think it's damaging, but assuming a book was a collector's item, you just destroyed any resale or appraisal value.  You have caused a permanent physical change to his property. You owe him an apology and a new, undamaged copy of the book.", "I\u2019d be pissed! \n\nYTA \n\nI keep my books in pristine condition. No folded corners, no marking in it, no page crinkled.

I hate hobby reading, and even I know dog earring a book is a dick move", "YTA", "Soft YTA because you weren\u2019t aware that folding the pages was wrong. Use a bookmark in future, if he ever lets you read it again. And buy him a replacement.

I\u2019ll try to give you a comparison so you can understand why he\u2019s upset.  \n\n\nThat book was really special to him, but he didn\u2019t even hesitate to loan it to you.  You treated it carelessly, and damaged it in a way that can\u2019t be repaired.", "YTA. If you don't have a bookmark just use a freaking shop bill or metro ticket. Folding pages is nasty.", "YTA - Book lovers, we are a special breed. Treat our books with gentle hands. No dog-eared pages. Don't lay it down with the book open and pages side down.

If there's a book cover, don't bend or tear it.", "YTA\n\n\nYou should've been taught since childhood, when borrowing someone else's things you return them in the same or better condition.

There are different standards for your belongings and ones you're borrowing from others.", "YTA- what you do to your books is up to you. If you're touching someone else's books or library books- use a bookmark, a receipt, a string, a scrap of paper- anything. But do not dog-ear a page or damage someone's property.   \nIn case he allows you to borrow books in the future- do not break their spines either.", "YTA - I love books. But I dog-ear, and recently I\u2019ve been sticky-noting and have been looking for nice highlighters for parts of the book I really like.\n\nBut those are *my books.* I can choose to do that to my books. Not everyone is okay with that. I wouldn\u2019t do that to someone else\u2019s books.\n\nIt might have been absent-minded of you and you didn\u2019t mean any harm, but his books are clearly very important to him and he wants to keep them in good condition. That\u2019s understandable, when borrowing anything it\u2019s expected that the item will be returned in the same condition it was lent, to the best of your ability. Try to be more mindful of this.", "NAH. Dog earing pages is a personal thing. You need to ask before you do that on a book you don't own. Bookmarks can be any kind of paper or thin object and are easy to find. His reaction might be an overstatement but he certainly could have mentioned he didn't like that.", "YTA. Bend the pages in your own books. Your brother obviously has a connection to his books.", "YTA. He overreacted a bit but why would you do that to a book that wasn\u2019t yours?

Bookmarks or look at page number! YTA", "Lol this is a weird lesson that everyone who knows a book lover has to learn. I did this to someone once and didn't get it either.

People think I'm crazy for reading paperbacks only halfway open. The covers will get stuck.", "You're in the minority here, since most of us don't like our books getting destroyed. Just because you and your sis are ok with it, doesn't mean it's the norm.", "He probably didn't think he had to", "No one should have to tell you to respect their property. If you borrowed someone\u2019s shirt, you wouldn\u2019t return it dirty if you accidentally spilled something on it.", "^ THIS! I would have lost my shit too if they were my book! I have two pencil cases of bookmarks and every time someone in my house buys a book they also have to buy a bookmarker.

You owe your brother an apology AND a new book!", "When its your book do what you want, when its someone elses book you return it in the same condition you received it.\n\nFrequent dog earing makes a book more voluminous/harder to close and shelve.", "It would be a very long time before there was a 'next time' if someone dared dog-ear one of my books. I don't always buy new books, some are from library sales, but once they are mine, no more dog-earring the pages. \n\nWhat you do with your property is your choice. What you do with someone's else property is whatever does the least amount of damage while properly using it. Bending page corners damages the book permanently.", "Exactly - there\u2019s nothing morally wrong with dog-earing books in general but you also have to be respectful of borrowed property. \n\nOP you should apologize to your brother, offer to replace the book, and promise to only use bookmarks with his books in the future.", "I doubt it was a single page if OP has a habit of folding pages to make their spot.

He did it Willingly and on purpose", "I know that as I read every day. OP said she\u2019s starting to read so she likely didn\u2019t make this connection.

I'm assuming he only folded over one page as he had just started reading the book. However, he doesn't mention how he folded the page(s); a single corner isn't so bad but folding over multiple corners, or folding the entire page in half could make me irate too! Bookmarks people; use them!", "no it was a mistake that he should've told op to not do again. Normal people don't scream and shout the first time a minor offense happens.", "If it was a collectible book, OP destroyed its value.", "The problem is that she BORROWED his book and would not have returned it in the condition he gave it to her in had he not seen her folding the page.", "Cars and books are not interchangable.  Cars cost thousands and books are a dime a dozen.", "Minor offense? Capital crime. He should have annihilated OP from orbit.", "And screaming & slammed doors corrected that?

It\u2019s not about monetary value, if someone really loves something, they\u2019d trade something technically more valuable for it.\n\nBut the car was just an analogy. It could be a small hole in a borrowed shirt, a scratch in a borrowed frying pan, light teeth marks on a borrowed pencil. All of those, in this context not done in an accident but done deliberately, would be disrespectful to someone else\u2019s property. You might fidget with the loose threads on your shirt, but not someone else\u2019s. You might use metal utensils in your non-stick frying pan, but not someone else\u2019s. You might chew on your pencils, but not someone else\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s best to take care to remember that these borrowed items belong to someone else, and to treat them as such."]}
