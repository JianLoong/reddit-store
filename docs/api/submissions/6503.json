I\u2019ve recently started trying to read more and I saw a book recommendation online, I noticed my brother reading the same book a few days earlier and instead of buying one online I thought I\u2019d just ask him if I could borrow his, he said he\u2019d finished reading it and to go ahead but just return it when I\u2019m finished. There was no problem with this on either end. Anyways I was reading the book in the living room, my brother came in, no problem. I folded the paper over to keep the page and as I was doing that he looked over and started shouting at me for bending the page, he grabbed the book from me and stormed upstairs and slammed his door, I followed him up to see why it was such a big problem but he continued to scream at me for \u201cruining\u201d his books, I\u2019ve always done that with books and I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s bad, I get that he likes his books but jeez.\n\nEdit - Thankyou all for the comments they were actually helpful, I didn\u2019t think this would blow up but yeah I\u2019m a complete AH. \n\nClearing up some things, my brother is autistic so that\u2019s why he reacted the way he did. I\u2019m not excusing my actions but I genuinely didn\u2019t know and I have since apologised and I will be buying him a new book and getting myself some bookmarks aswell.", "created_utc": 1672877310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103jq3v/aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_book/", "score": 11806, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Offer to replace the book.", "YTA\n\nI would be pissed too, I HATE when people damage my books. If you can't return exactly how you borrowed it, you shouldn't ask for them (book or anything else).", "If it\u2019s not your book the max you should be doing is flipping pages not indenting them", "YTA. The truth hurts but you did ruin the book. I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t know not to dog ear books. Sheesh.", "I'm surprised that you've reached the age of 21 without learning that people who are serious about their books hate \u2013 and I mean absolutely, to the very core of their being, HATE \u2013 it when people bend the corners to mark a page. Sounds like you've learned the hard way. To you, it's a non-event; to your brother, the book is now genuinely ruined. I vote NAH since you genuinely didn't know. But rather than going the \"Geez, what's the big deal, stop overreacting\" route with your brother, I recommend a sincere apology with the explanation that you honestly didn't know this mattered to him, and the assurance that you'll respect the way he wants his books treated in the future.", "YTA not your book. You don't fold pages of books that don't belong to you. Now go buy him a replacement.", "YTA I would make you replace it. This is such a hard line for almost anyone that collects books.", "Slight ESH. You need to respect other people's belongings and the book collecters don't like dog earing the pages at it eventually ruins the book. \n\nYour brother could have explained to you in a better way to not do that rather than spiralling out. Dog earing pages is usually normal and not everyone value books as much as a collector do.", "YTA... I dog ear pages, but with someone else's books, I would never, even if i noticed that the pages were already dog-eared", "YTA. Ever heard of a bookmark?", "YTA. From your response it's clear you do not treasure books as much as your brother. If you are borrowing someone else's belongings, you should be treating it better.\n\nDon't dog-ear the books, and don't open the book so wide as to crease the binding.", "YTA\n\nBookmarks are a thing. If you had done that to one if my books I'd be equally angry.\n\nYou didn't respect your brothers belonging and you didn't respect him.\n\nYou should replace the book and apologise.", "NAH. You\u2019re not an asshole for folding a page the first time without knowing better. But now that you know, you should respect his property in the future and get a bookmark. Could an 18 year old have told you this without throwing a temper tantrum? Of course.", "ESH you much less so though.\n\nLook, we shouldn't touch other people's things and folding pages would be seen by alot of book readers as ruining the boom.\n\nBut WTF was that reaction?! That was one hell of an over reaction for a folded page over one book. Unless he has something going on with him then he's big asshole.", "YTA, fold your own books. If you\u2019re borrowing something you treat it extra well.", "Dog-earer here. YTA. Never ever do that to someone else\u2019s books. Yours, fine. But if you borrow a book treat it with respect. You should apologize to your brother, his book and possibly consider getting him a book as an apology gesture.", "YTA I also strongly dislike people that dog-ear pages in books. Always have and always will. I would be very upset if someone did that to a book I lent them, it\u2019s disrespectful. If you bought the book, fine you can ruin the pages all you want.

But now you do!\nYou don't EVER do that to a book! Especially other people's books! I would have reacted in exactly the same way and gotten completely over-the-top protective of my poor book if someone I lend it to treated it so horribly. Yes, people who care about their books sees this as a capital offence, it might seem crazy if you don't have the same feelings towards books, but that's the deal. You should apologise - But not to your brother. You should apologise to the book!", "nta..been a heavy reader  for 50 plus years..my sis also lends me  boxes of books to read which i return. i use a bookmark, fold corners over or do what you did. i nor my sis has any issues with it.  You brother sounds like he has  issues.. and an ah too..", "YTA\n\nDon't dog-ear other people's books. It's blatant damage and is disrespectful to his generosity", "YTA \n\nHe probably should have told you not to dog ear any pages (some are ok with it, most aren\u2019t) because it weakens the page and the crease will never come out.

In the future return any books you borrow in the same condition you get them.", "I mean, I'mma give this one a considered ESH. You really shouldn't dogear someone else's book. It is an effective way of keeping your place, but it does damage the page. You wouldn't do it on a library book, don't do it on a book you're borrowing from a family member.  \n\n\nThat said, unless your brother is 12 or has trouble interacting socially, there's no reason to react this way. The proper response would've been to ask you not to do that. Which, again, you shouldn't do.", "ESH - I get you had no idea, and your brother WAY over reacted, but please don\u2019t do that \ud83d\ude02 \nI got a brand new, kind of expensive cookbook, and my mom was looking through it so she could see if there were any recipes she wanted to use. She found one and she folded and hard creased the corner of the page. I also flipped out a little bc it hurt my soul \ud83d\ude2c I try not to lend out my books though, so maybe your brother should keep them to himself if he\u2019s that particular about them!", "ESH. \n\nIt\u2019s not your book, so you need to take care of it. Every personal librarian has different standards - for me, I like dogearred pages particularly if it was me that made the mark on a previous read, but others want their books pristine. Books can really be sacred objects for some. \n\nThat said, there should be a conversation about the expectation of how you return someone\u2019s property. You suck because you are not returning something the same or better than you found it. He sucks for not communicating and reacting the way he did.", "YTA you dont dogear a book that isnt yours.", "ESH you shouldn't dog ear pages on books that aren't yours but he could of just asked nicely not to do that and it would have been fine", "YTA along with everyone saying ESH. When you borrow something from someone you prioritise getting it back to them in the mint or whatever condition you were lent it in, you don\u2019t take it upon yourself to make creases where there were none all because it makes life a tad bit easier for you.", "YTA for damaging his property! That's what bookmarks are for. Heck, a tissue or square of TP or shred of junk mail would all have been much better choices.", "From one dog-earer to another, YTA.\n\nWhat your choose to do with a personal book (dog ear, write notes, crack the spine) is not ok to do to a borrowed book, especially if you know your brother collects books.\n\nBuy him a new copy.", "I get it, I always dog-ear my books. My kids are now doing it with their books too, but I\u2019ve taught them to only do it to their books, not a borrowed book. \n\nApologize, and only do it with your books from now on!", "In this case YTA. It's kinda common courtesy when someone loans you something to return it in the same condition that you got it in. That means no folding pages. He probably overreacted, but I understand him being annoyed.", "YTA. There is such a thing as a bookmark I\u2019m sure if your brother has that many books he has a few you ask to borrow or use a spare piece of paper you don\u2019t dog ear books like a 5 year old it\u2019s so rude", "Just to be clear, it sounds like you \"dogeared\" the corner of one of his pages?  And maybe even more?  Yes, YTA.  Bookmarking a page like that when it doesn't belong to you is not okay.", ">I folded the paper over to keep the page\n\nNever do this to a book that isn't yours.

To you it's just a book. To them it's something precious.", "YTA. As a bibliophile, you committed a heinous crime against books!\n\nIn all seriousness, you should return an item in the same condition it was borrowed. Folding pages is a massive no-no and destroys the condition of the book. Think of it as someone borrowing a dvd or computer game and returning it with fingerprints on the disc.", "YTA. Do not fold pages. Especially in a book that does not belong to you. You absolutely ruined his book and you now have to replace it and you need to apologize.", "YTA. never bend another persons books pages.", "When you ordinarily borrow things from someone, wouldn't  you want to return it to them in the same condition if possible? Especially when you know that he really values his collection. Buy him a replacement and apologize without any weird excuses about what you'd normally do. His belongings deserve respect, as would yours. YTA", "YTA and a monster! How dare you treat books like that. \n\nUse a friggin bookmark! Even if it's just a scrap of paper or a post it.", "ESH. If you knew your brother is super protective of his books, you should have gotten a bookmark instead of folding the corner of the page. \n\nThat being said though, it isn\u2019t \u201cruined\u201d (and I\u2019m a massive book snob) and the book will be fine even with a mild crease in the page.

It's common to dog-ear a page, but it's considered rude and damaging in most literary communities if it's not your property. Not entirely your fault for doing a mindless habit, but be sure to use this as a lesson. Apologize and keep in mind that, when you borrow something, return it in the same or better condition than when you got it.", "NTA you were just being instinctive and using what you could to save the page.\n\nYour brother isn't TA either though because some people are really strict about books and their integrity and we can't blame them. \n\nI'd suggest finding yourself a bookmark you want to use and talking to your brother about how you won't fold the pages anymore because you realise you can use a bookmark. \n\nSaving a books structural integrity and quality is important and something we don't prioritise in this century but it is important in the grand scheme of things. \n\nI hope you make up with your brother and finish the book!\n\nMake sure to apologise though because you did hurt him immensely even if you don't understand \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: So I'm getting a lot of downvotes.. what did I say that was bad/against reddit rules?", "YTA - it wasn\u2019t your book.

If you don\u2019t read much, you might not realize some folks don\u2019t like this.\n\nScreaming, running off, slamming doors and more yelling is so unhinged. He could have been an adult & simply asked you to mark your progress with a bookmark next time.", "YTA I am just like your brother, I read my books in a way that keeps them in pristine condition and have blown up at people for bending my books before. Now I know better and show people how I read my books with the condition of replacement if damaged. For some people that is how we are, we love and treasure our books and want to make them last. Apologize for damaging his property and replace it.", "YTA.  I fold down the corner of the page, underline passages I particularly like, etc.  But only on my own books!

Hopefully, he'll forgive and get over it, once you've replaced the book.", "YTA \n\nIf he\u2019s a book collector you just ruined the value of that book.

It creases forever, it makes it look less pretty, and if done enough it can lead to page tearing from wear. The issue isn't just that you made a mistake, it's that you won't own up to it.

It is his property after all. If he doesn\u2019t want a corner folded then a corner shouldn\u2019t be folded.

If someone dog eared my books, I would not let them borrow them anymore, and I would be upset. Some people like their books in as good as condition as possible. I don\u2019t even crack my spines.

I\u2019ve recently started trying to read more and I saw a book recommendation online, I noticed my brother reading the same book a few days earlier and instead of buying one online I thought I\u2019d just ask him if I could borrow his, he said he\u2019d finished reading it and to go ahead but just return it when I\u2019m finished. There was no problem with this on either end. Anyways I was reading the book in the living room, my brother came in, no problem. I folded the paper over to keep the page and as I was doing that he looked over and started shouting at me for bending the page, he grabbed the book from me and stormed upstairs and slammed his door, I followed him up to see why it was such a big problem but he continued to scream at me for \u201cruining\u201d his books, I\u2019ve always done that with books and I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s bad, I get that he likes his books but jeez.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
