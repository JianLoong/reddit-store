I\u2019ve recently started trying to read more and I saw a book recommendation online, I noticed my brother reading the same book a few days earlier and instead of buying one online I thought I\u2019d just ask him if I could borrow his, he said he\u2019d finished reading it and to go ahead but just return it when I\u2019m finished. There was no problem with this on either end. Anyways I was reading the book in the living room, my brother came in, no problem. I folded the paper over to keep the page and as I was doing that he looked over and started shouting at me for bending the page, he grabbed the book from me and stormed upstairs and slammed his door, I followed him up to see why it was such a big problem but he continued to scream at me for \u201cruining\u201d his books, I\u2019ve always done that with books and I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s bad, I get that he likes his books but jeez.", "created_utc": 1672877310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103jq3v/aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_book/", "score": 1011, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like you've learned the hard way. To you, it's a non-event; to your brother, the book is now genuinely ruined. I vote NAH since you genuinely didn't know.

You don't fold pages of books that don't belong to you. Now go buy him a replacement.", "YTA I would make you replace it. This is such a hard line for almost anyone that collects books.", "Slight ESH. You need to respect other people's belongings and the book collecters don't like dog earing the pages at it eventually ruins the book. \n\nYour brother could have explained to you in a better way to not do that rather than spiralling out. Dog earing pages is usually normal and not everyone value books as much as a collector do.", "YTA... I dog ear pages, but with someone else's books, I would never, even if i noticed that the pages were already dog-eared", "YTA. Ever heard of a bookmark?", "YTA.

Every personal librarian has different standards - for me, I like dogearred pages particularly if it was me that made the mark on a previous read, but others want their books pristine. Books can really be sacred objects for some. \n\nThat said, there should be a conversation about the expectation of how you return someone\u2019s property. You suck because you are not returning something the same or better than you found it. He sucks for not communicating and reacting the way he did.", "YTA you dont dogear a book that isnt yours.", "ESH you shouldn't dog ear pages on books that aren't yours but he could of just asked nicely not to do that and it would have been fine", "YTA along with everyone saying ESH.

That's what bookmarks are for. Heck, a tissue or square of TP or shred of junk mail would all have been much better choices.", "From one dog-earer to another, YTA.\n\nWhat your choose to do with a personal book (dog ear, write notes, crack the spine) is not ok to do to a borrowed book, especially if you know your brother collects books.\n\nBuy him a new copy.", "I get it, I always dog-ear my books.

And maybe even more?  Yes, YTA.  Bookmarking a page like that when it doesn't belong to you is not okay.", ">I folded the paper over to keep the page\n\nNever do this to a book that isn't yours.

As a bibliophile, you committed a heinous crime against books!\n\nIn all seriousness, you should return an item in the same condition it was borrowed.

It is his property after all. If he doesn\u2019t want a corner folded then a corner shouldn\u2019t be folded.

I\u2019ve recently started trying to read more and I saw a book recommendation online, I noticed my brother reading the same book a few days earlier and instead of buying one online I thought I\u2019d just ask him if I could borrow his, he said he\u2019d finished reading it and to go ahead but just return it when I\u2019m finished. There was no problem with this on either end. Anyways I was reading the book in the living room, my brother came in, no problem. I folded the paper over to keep the page and as I was doing that he looked over and started shouting at me for bending the page, he grabbed the book from me and stormed upstairs and slammed his door, I followed him up to see why it was such a big problem but he continued to scream at me for \u201cruining\u201d his books, I\u2019ve always done that with books and I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s bad, I get that he likes his books but jeez.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's so infuriating when people have no consideration or care for other people's things when it's entrusted to them.", "Just FYI, the corners of used envelope make excellent bookmarks.", "Love thrift books.com for used books!  Such good condition they look brand new.", "Same for me. I cherish books", "My best friend and I bought the same book to read together, and I\u2019ve been using the receipt I got from the bookstore that day as a bookmark. When I was little I used a square of toilet paper, for some reason", "Hell, I've used a tv remote when in a pickle looking for something.", "3rd grade when you\u2019re forced to go to the library to pick out a book, just dont fuck with stuff that isn\u2019t yours, it\u2019s not a hard lesson.", "I also break spines \ud83e\udd23 I read a lot of mass markets.", "That's my point, don't borrow a book and fold pages, common courtesy. My favorite books are all trashed too, I don't fold pages but they're well loved I'll just say lol I should have used different wording.", "I'm getting down voted to hell bc ppl here aren't very mature and think it's fine to scream about minor problems", "Yes! Thank you for being a fellow sane person in this thread. Books are tools meant to be used. I annotate a lot of the non-fiction I read. I travel a lot, so books are always getting thrown in my carry-on bag. I am not careless with my books and they are all in good condition, but they are certainly not in mint condition- even the autographed ones. If I lend a book to a friend, I'd probably be a little annoyed if they wrote or highlighted in it, but could not care less if they dog-eared a page.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I agree with you and /u/lemonycricketLegs Some people are thoughtless and inconsiderate. But it\u2019s not malicious, it\u2019s purely selfish. Sadly, I think that thoughtlessness, inconsiderateness, and selfishness are more common than \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201ccommon courtesy\u201d", "Best book I've ever personally read", "People just need to make sure their marginalia is sufficiently juicy to interest future scholars \ud83d\ude01", "I have a couple books I read so often I started writing little notes in. for future me to enjoy as I inevitably reread the books again. Sometimes the damage is character, even though it makes it harder to preserve. \n\nBut the idea of doing anything to someone else's book is just. no. unacceptably awful. ahhhhhh", "I\u2019m not even into books but come on bro that\u2019s definitely one anyone should want", "I\u2019m internally squealing because I collect Poe books. Pick me pick me!", "And your point is? Collecting books is special to his brother. He never said he planned to have a famous collection one day. He only mentioned that his brother collects books and clearly cares that those books are preserved.", "Regardless of intrinsic value, they have value to him. I have paperbacks that I read when I was a kid and I will treasure them until I die.", "Of course, no 18-year-old has ever saved up for something expensive.", "Being 18 doesn\u2019t translate to that stereotype.", "Regardless of the assumptions you're making, the collection is important to the brother and the book is not OP's.", "Me too\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96", "Mom???\n\nMy mom used to use the TV remote when I was a kid and she would finish a book a day. I however have been known to stick my DS, and then later my 3DS into books in an emergency. The list of stuff we've all used to mark our places is definitely long and some of them are slightly weird, but they've always been our books if there's risk of damage.", "Plus like...dog earing or folding a page can easily be fixed? You just have to flatten the page in the book and put something heavy on top of it. Or use a low setting iron over a towel on top of the page.", "I really enjoyed the series on Prime.", "Yeah it's absolutely one of my favourites if not my favourite. My almost gf and I both love reading so we've agreed to exchange copies of our favourite books for Valentine's. She's going to get Good Omens and Neverwhere", "Lol tbh if you are a scholar of marginalia or social history who wants to learn about how people use books it\u2019s so so useful. I love when books have a whole list of names showing who they\u2019ve belonged to over the years.", "If I had an award to give, I would. Thank you.", "Absolutely - I would never ever do something like that to someone else\u2019s book. University books that aren\u2019t rare may have the occasional note *in pencil*, that\u2019s my limit."]}
