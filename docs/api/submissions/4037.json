It\u2019s your right to ask, and his right not to tell. He may be protecting you from something that would ruin the memory of your late mother. From the story you told, nobody has crossed a boundary into AH territory.", "NAH - I understand why you\u2019d like to know that information but it was your parent\u2019s relationship. Your father isn\u2019t obligated to share their relationship history with you. It may be painful for him to talk about, he may be trying to protect your feelings in some way, there\u2019s at least a dozen more reasons why he may not want to talk about it.", "INFO\n\nHow old are you now?  Some reasons may be no big deal to share, others may not be appropriate to share with a minor.  \n\nMaybe, rather than focusing on the reasons for the divorce, and your dad, talk to your maternal grandparents and find out more about your mother in general?  Knowing the reason for the divorce, without knowing the larger context of her life, won't lend much understanding of her.", "It really is not your business.\n\nBy pushing for information you can set yourself up for hearing things that you don't want to know. Plus, with your mother gone, you'd only get one side of the story, so you wouldn't know the truth anyhow.\n\nNAH. Your dad is awesome for not dragging up only his side of the past.", "NAH- and actually. It isn't your business.  Also child of divorce here and frankly, I know things I wish I didn't. The reality is that it doesn't change my relationship with either of my parents and that their relationship with each other - really and truly- is nothing to do with me. My mother passed over 15 years ago so I do understand pretty well your circumstances.", "I was going to say N A H but you keep asking and pushing for an answer. Which makes YTA. He doesn't need to tell you. It's much more his business than yours. He may be ashamed, embarrassed, angry because of the reason. Shoot, he may be protecting your mother's memory. It really isn't your business, though o understand why you want to know.\n\nHe knows you want to know. If he's ever ready, he will tell you. But he may never be, and that's okay too.", "YTA. No issues in asking, but doubling down and ignoring his boundaries and demanding personal info once he\u2019s said No makes you the AH.\n\nEdited to add: the dad may have incredibly valid reasons for not wanting to discuss, for example what if mom cheated?? Does the OP really need or WANT to know this?", "YTA. At the end of the day, their marriage is their business,  not yours.  It doesn't matter that they're your parents, it wasn't your marriage. It's one thing if you asked once and then dropped i, but you didn't.  And you're not respecting your father's wishes.

If he doesn't wamt you to know... You have no right to know.", "YTA. Its fine to ask but your dad is right, his relationship with your mum is his business, not yours and if he doesn't want to tell you, then you should drop it. Has it occurred to you, that your dad may be protecting your memories of her. It's entirely possible he doesn't want you to think badly of her for something she did.", "INFO I'm leaning N A H even though I think you're wrong. In a lot of ways it's not really your business why. There are all sorts of reasons for divorce and a lot of the time it can't be linked to one specific thing. A lot of people I know only know that their parents were fighting and it wasn't working out. Some people are old enough to remember hearing fights some aren't. Some people know exactly why because some huge thing happened.\n\nWhat sort of answer are you looking for? If you're looking for something deeper than \"We were fighting\" / \"we drifted apart\" you may never have gotten that and I think you may be out of luck.", "YTA its not your business. If your dad doesnt want to tell you then he doesnt have to. Especially in your circumstance it does not seem like its a big pressing issue so I suggest that you just let sleeping dogs lie.", "Sorry, but YTA. It really isn't your personal business. Sounds like you just continue to harass him.", "It. Is. None. Of. Your. Business.\n\nNot. Your. Marriage.", "Gentle YTA \n\nI understand that you want to know but other people's marriage, even your parents', isn't your business. \n\nPersonal lives and private lives are just that, personal and private.\n\nIt's okay to ask but you have to accept his answer. He doesn't want to share the reason they divorced. At least not now.  Maybe that will change someday. Maybe it won't. He now knows that you have questions.\n\nOne way to guarantee not getting an answer is to insist on one, and to hound someone who has told you that they don't want to discuss it.", "YTA\n\nStop being a pesky little brat. It's 0% of your business.\n\nETA - how tf is OP not an AH for continuing to push and ask? I get having feelings about it or asking once or twice, but the man fucking said no", "NAH. It's tough, but he's right. However, you are not wrong for having feelings about the situation.", "YTA I want to say N-A-H, but your dad has said no repeatedly and you\u2019re not respecting that. He\u2019s right that it was his marriage; what happened between him and your mom is his business. You don\u2019t have right to know that if he doesn\u2019t want to tell you. My parents divorced and I know way too much. Like others have said, he\u2019s probably trying to protect your memory of your mom.

I am not sure if my mother would tell me if I asked her. I do know why as I overheard a long conversation before they formally started the process. I've had bits of closure about it over the years and I did read some correspondence between my father and his lawyer. My dad's lawyer wanted to go for more and my father told him to cool it. \"She is the mother of my children and she can have whatever she wants as long as I can still see the children, that is the most important.\"\n\nAnd for the most part, my parents successfully co-parented before the term \"co-parenting\" was a thing.", "NAH. I can understand why you want to know because our parents\u2019 relationship with one another does impact how we view romantic relationships as adults. People whose parents had a happy, long lasting relationship have a more optimistic view on relationships. People with divorced parents may be more pessimistic. On the other hand, I can see your dad\u2019s view on this. He might feel that it\u2019s in the past and he doesn\u2019t want to revisit it. He may feel that he shouldn\u2019t discuss it with you because your mother isn\u2019t here to give her side of the story. Personally I think he should tell you before a blabber mouth relative tells you but it is his choice.  \n\nMaybe you should sit down with your dad and gently explain to him why it\u2019s important that you know. Right now you\u2019re both taking aggressive stances about your \u201crights\u201d to this information. That\u2019s not helpful in this situation.

Wife died from cancer while we were getting a divorce.  She moved back in with me so I could take care of her but my kids knew that we weren't a couple.  Neither of my kids has asked why we were getting divorced, but I'm expecting it to come at some point.  Not sure how much I'll say.  I've always made sure to never talk badly about their mom, but there's no way to give reasons for the divorce without making her look bad.  They don't need to remember that side of her.

You need to be prepared to hear something you wish you hadn\u2019t heard.

If you\u2019re prepared for any answer, and your mom\u2019s family won\u2019t talk or you\u2019re not comfortable asking them, divorce records are often public information.
