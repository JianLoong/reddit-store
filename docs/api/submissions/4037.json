There are certain things that are not for you to know. It's just private. Now you said his answer was \"she is my wife and it's none of your business\" This makes me think that either you've poked this subject a lot or your father is being defensive. But either way is it really worth whatever relationship you have with your dad?", "NTA \n\nYou can ask. You can also ask your grandparents or some aunts if you want to know. Your dad might be very sensitive about it and wants to protect you. But be prepared to not like what you hear.", "Tough one there but I\u2019m gonna have to go with YTA. Your Dad has his reasons. They may be to protect him. They may be to protect you and the memories of your mother. If you insist, you may want to ask trusted members of your mother\u2019s side of the family. Be prepared for unsavory news that you can\u2019t unhear.", "YTA. He said it wasn't your business. You drop it.", "I\u2019d say ask the grandparents or family friends. They probably know. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are not the AH for asking. It is a natural curiosity. But your dad isn't ready to discuss and he may never be. You do need to respect that and not push the issue any further.", "Her having cancer has nothing to do with him though? Presumably she got cancer after the divorce so it\u2019s not like he would\u2019ve been cheating on a cancer patient at that time.", "NAH here, but if you keep pushing, you may be. \n\nAs a divorced person, my kids have asked me more than once why I divorced their dad. I tell them that my marriage and divorce remains my business, and I will not be sharing details. That all they need to know is we both love them. They get it, even if they are nosey.\n\nHere's the deal.  I'll never share the details of why I left. It broke my heart, and made me angrier than I've ever been in my life. But that was between my ex and I; it's not on the kids, nor is the knowledge of what happened something the kids need to shoulder. \n\nPerhaps there is more than just privacy involved in your dad's refusal to share details. Something he did, something your mom did, something they did - something he doesn't want to share? I'd leave it be. If your dad was a bad person, your mom's family would have cut him out when you reached adulthood. They haven't. That says a lot.", "YTA.\n\n1. You asked, he said he didn\u2019t want to discuss it. That should\u2019ve been the end of it. \n2. No, parents are not obligated to discuss or share their relationship issues with their kids.\n3. Surely someone in your mom\u2019s family knows more and they haven\u2019t told you either. So either it was something minor or non-controversial or it was something bigger and they too don\u2019t think it\u2019s your business.", "YTA. It\u2019s none of your business.", "NAH\n\nyou aren't wrong for wanting to know and the reality is that it DID affect you.\n\nHe isn't wrong for now wanting to share personal business. \n\nJust a very uncomfortable situation. But it might help you to consider what drives you to want to know, curiosity? desire to learn from others mistakes? Many reasons. and you may need to consider that the truth might be painful to hear.", "Or dad cheated and doesn\u2019t want his kid to know he did something awful", "Maybe she had an affair.   Maybe he had an affair.  Maybe she was abusive.  Maybe he was abusive.  Maybe she had a mental breakdown. Maybe he had a mental breakdown.   Maybe they had another child who died.  Maybe divorces are usually very painful even in the best of situations and it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s place to try to force people to talk about traumatic life events.", "I agree. I think mom had an affair and dad doesn\u2019t want to ruin mom\u2019s good name to the daughter. I fully understand both sides. NAH. I mean, you could straight up ask dad if mom had an affair but that\u2019s also a kinda shitty move. I think overall, if you and dad are close, accept the mystery. It likely has nothing to do with you and is about preserving mom\u2019s memory.", "NAH you can go to the court house where they got divorced and request the records. \n\nYes it might say \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d but it will show you what they fought over, if anyone was subpoenaed and so on. \n\nYou might get more context then your father is given and like mine you can see if the judge thought both your parents were asshole, so it can show how much animosity.", "NAH\n\nI get wanting to know but 95% of explanations can only hurt you or hurt your impression of one of your parents.\n\nIt's always worth noting in a dispute there is always different sides. Maybe he feels it won't be fair to give you just his side of the situation.", "Just take it as a compliment that he still gets along with her family. The reason won't change anything, right?", "YTA\n\n\nIt seriously is none of your business. It has nothing to do with you. It was a matter between your mother and your father. Our curiosity does not give us the entitlement to expect someone to discuss their private business with us. \n\n\nStop pushing. If he felt comfortable in you knowing then you would know. But your wanting to and your curiosity do  not mean he has to tell you. How will this knowledge improve your life. How will you badgering your father into divulging information that is none of your business going to make the relationship you have with him and your mothers side of the family better?", "NAH\n\nIt's not your business", "And if they don't want to say anything then know that is s hornets nest of hurt you are going to regret opening up.", "Agreed. The fact that there is already a good relationship between his mother's family and his father speaks volumes about his father's character. \n\n\nEven taking only that into consideration as well as the father's refusal to speak of why the relationship ended already leads to assumptions. Esp if his grandparents are also not discussing the matter."]}
