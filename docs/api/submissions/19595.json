I am assuming he is not posting these photos or showing them to others, he is just keeping photos of his son.  I am also assuming you guys have a great relationship and this is the only REAL hiccup between you two.\n\nI am not saying he was right, I am just saying he is your dad and honestly I can see his side.  I know I prefer candid photos of my kids vs posed or staged.  He knows you dont like your photo taken but remember, you will always be his little boy that he can screw around with.\n\nI have a weird way of remembering things I have done with my children, most are grown and moved away now.  There are several stains on the garage floor I never cleaned up.  There are chips of wood I never smoothed out on a wall, there is a smudge on my windshield I will never replace.  All of these things occurred as a result of things my children did helping me with a project or just playing around and EVERY time I see them it reminds me of my kids.  I still have about a 20\" piece of water hose sticking out of the ground where my, now 24 year old son, turned the water on and kept pushing the hose into the ground until he ran out of hose.  A 50' hose gone, but I dont care as I have a memory of him every time I go outside and see that hose.\n\nAll I am saying is maybe cut him some slack.", "CONGRATULATIONS, You have just admitted to a probable crime.\n\nThis is great.  YTA, you cant go around policing what people around you do.  So is your dad, but a lot less than you.\n\nIf you was on your own property, you can say no.  If its in a public area, then you can have no say to it.\n\nDependant on the country, you touching or using someone else's computer or devices without permission is actually illegal, and potentially land you in prison/jail.", "I love that you ask permission first.\n\nWhile I don't have children, I always ask for permission of family and friends if I want to share a photo I've taken of them on my socials. I know not everyone wants photos of them circulating on the Internet.", "well...... I am one of those parents.", "By your logic, Dad has no say when OP walks in on him wiping his ass, banging Mom, or struggling to fix something then posting them online. OP's camera = OP'S say. Dad never said he didn't want his photos taken.", ">I am assuming he is not posting these photos \n\nWhy would you make that assumption? Please read the post:\n\n>and i know these photos go on facebook", "It was his father's phone, not a stranger's. His father wasn't going to delete the picture, and op asked multiple times for no pictures to be taken without his shirt on. His father still did it even as op was attempting to cover himself and said no. He purposefully crossed boundaries. NTA", "I spent my formative years in the computer underground before social media was a thing. In that culture, people are very protective of their identity.\n\nWhen I became a dad, I just took it to a whole new level. It is extremely important to me that I teach my daughter that she is allowed to set boundaries. And that she has every right to either deny or Grant consent.\n\nIt sounds like the OPs dad is a bit of a dick. \"You're my kid and I can do what I want.\" is so cringe.", "By your logic, if you owe me $5, and I see your wallet I can root around in it and take what\u2019s mine.", "Yeesh.  There IS a difference between public and private settings, you know.", "I missed that line, well that changes everything I said.", "But it's common sense not to steal. Do strangers have to remind you of common sense? OP stated multiple times he didn't want his photo taken. Dad didn't listen to his wishes so OP went in and deleted the photos. The Dad should be grateful that's ALL he did. OP isn't asking for millions, only not to have his photo taken, and his Dad isn't respecting him.\n\nEdit : I re-read your reply. If I owe it to you, I'm not obligated to pay it back right when you see the money in my wallet. In this story, Dad stole photos of his son. So the son was right in taking them back."]}
