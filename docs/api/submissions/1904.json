We share the same birth month. This is relevant because as soon as we were born so close together my parents took it as a sign that we were bonded in some extra way and were meant to be more than sisters. They dressed us alike and had us do everything together. They pulled me out of mainstream school to homeschool both of us after the school refused to allow lunch and recess for our classrooms to happen at the same time, so we'd be eating and playing together. I was homeschooled for 5 years before they had to put me back due to an undiagnosed, at the time, learning disability. Then they enrolled my sister in school when they realized homeschooling would not work with me.\n\nWe both had friends but my sister was a bad friend because she would always put me before them, would dump them without notice if our parents had us spending time together and more than once she forced them to let me hang out with them. My sister loved how our parents raised us. I hated it.\n\nWe shared a bedroom despite being the only kids and having a four bedroom house.\n\nWe were in the same extra curricular activities per our parents insistence.\n\nWe had joint birthday parties every year.\n\nWe had to prioritize each other before friends meaning if our sibling wasn't welcome at a party we were invited to, the person invited didn't get to go.\n\nI got my freedom when I moved out and started college. It was weird at first. I was not used to the freedom and college was a struggle for me because of my learning disability. But I loved it. I thrived on it. I never once missed my sister or my parents.\n\nShe assumed once she started college she would be moving in with me, but I said no. I had already cut our parents off at that point and had been low contact with her but she still pushed. I didn't give in and now 2 years on she has decided she's done with college and we should live together and resume things like before. I told her no, I told her countless times that it would never happen. She kept pushing and pushing. So I told her I did not want to go back to the way we were before, I never wanted to live with her again and I did not enjoy all the things she talked about missing from before. I told her I would not change my mind and she needed to move on.\n\nShe was crushed. I knew she would be upset. I felt like it was my only choice to get her to back off. She cried that we're sisters and our relationship had been so good before. I told her it was only good in her eyes. She called me a bad sister and ended the call. A few days later she decided I needed to apologize to her and then work on getting back to how we were.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668009740, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqn1z7/aita_for_knowingly_upsetting_my_sister_as_a_way/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sister needs to grow up and live her own life.", "NTA- What your parents did was strange, I am glad you went no contact and am hoping you have the support in place where you are now to keep that no contact. \n\ntry to reframe your mindset from \" a decision that would upset my sister\" to \"A decision that would make myself happy\"", "The way your parents raised you is truly bizarre. Even twins are two separate people, with separate personalities, habits, likes, dislikes, etc. You both should have been free to have alone time, privacy, separate birthdays, friend groups, etc. As soon as I read \u201cmore than sisters\u201d I thought \u201cuh oh.\u201d Not to mention, what is *more* than sisters? Conjoined twins? Matching outfits are cute on little kids but after a certain point everyone moves past that. All very bizarre parenting behavior and I\u2019m sorry for your experience. No one should \u201chate\u201d their childhood. \n\nAnyway, you\u2019re definitely NTA. You were honest with her about your feelings and boundaries, certainly not an easy conversation, and you were not mean about it. Good for you! You can still move past this disagreement and repair the relationship without sacrificing your newfound freedom to just be YOU without a shadow in the form of your sister. A little independence might do her some good in the long run too.", "NTA.  What you said was only upsetting to someone who refuses to accept that you\u2019re two different people with different lives, and you need space to live yours.  Your parents may have created this dynamic, but your sister is old enough at this point to question it for herself, or at least to recognize that you\u2019re no longer under any obligation to keep doing things the way they want and she has no reason to expect you will, much less demand your compliance.  You\u2019re going to have to hold firm that she doesn\u2019t have to like you not wanting to be joined at the hip, but she needs to come to terms with the reality it\u2019s not happening - even if that means you\u2019re going to have to limit your contact with her if she still refuses to accept you\u2019re not changing your mind.", "NTA - good for you for realizing what you needed, voicing it and sticking to your boundaries. \n\nShe can come to whatever decisions she wants, but you are not responsible for fulfilling her wishes.", "NTA. The approach could have been gentler since you knew she loved being so close to you but the truth had to be told nevertheless. If you\u2019re open to it, maybe have a calmer discussion with her on redefining your relationship with healthy boundaries and explain that you felt your independence and boundaries were never observed or respected by your parents. I\u2019m close to my siblings and I get the \u201cyou have to be close\u201d mentality, but your parents just didn\u2019t let you grow into your own persons. Unfortunately she sees part of her identity webbed with yours and that\u2019s something you ran from as soon as you could. It doesn\u2019t sound like you resent your sister, just that you wanted to be your own person, so maybe there\u2019s enough love there for a redefined relationship with her if she\u2019s also willing.", "NTA\n\nMaybe you aren\u2019t close now and just need to develop on separate tracks for a while.

You don't need to 'get back to how you were.' You need to cut your whole family out, sister and parents both. \n\nThey *created* and *fostered* this hella-unhealthy dynamic, permanently warping you two. The psychological scars from your sad excuse for a childhood will endure for years, and likely never fully fade away.\n\n*She* seems to actively need said dynamic, which is not her fault, but can't be fixed without several years (at minimum) in therapy. That's why she's so adamant about making you blink first here. Little sis never had a chance to form her own sense of individual self: she literally *does not know who she is without you*, and thus is spiraling psychologically. She wants your old wavelength back because she's unstable without it. \n\nBut that's not on you. Your parents are responsible, and they need to take the blame. Right now, the best thing you can do for her is ***stay away.*** \n\nDon't apologize. Don't get back in contact. Don't acknowledge them at all. \n\nYes, it means she'll suffer. Maybe a little; likely a lot. But this, I'm afraid, is one of those situations where pain is unavoidable. She has to hurt before she can grow, and she has lots of growing to do - growing that can't happen if you're still a part of her life. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Even when you were so blunt, you did not get through to her.  She decided within a week that you didn't mean what you said and therefore she will allow you to apologize to her.  \n\nYou know your family and your sister and you've used the method that is mostly likely to get through to her.  Unfortunately, it sounds like one time will not be enough.    \n\nIt sounds horrible living in a home where your parents did not allow you to be an individual, to learn what YOU like and don't like.\n\nStay loyal to yourself.  You had to wait all this time to be yourself, so enjoy it.", "NAH between you and your sister. The way you describe growing up would be a ridiculously controlling way to treat actual twins!  (...I mean, I'm an actual twin, and I've never heard of such a thing.)  I'm so sorry that your relationship with your sister has been damaged by your parents'  bizarre and inappropriate expectations.\n\nDo you want to still be able to have some relationship with your little sister (or maybe to have a real one for the first time)? I wonder if there's something the two of you *could* do together that would respect your boundaries and give her an opportunity for some connection, even if it's as simple as meeting up at the gym to work out or having a weekly game night or taking an art class together. That might be a way to help her understand that it's not *her* you're rejecting, it's this whole artificial thing which was constructed around the two of you.", "NTA.

I was eventually fortunate enough to graduate from high school a year ahead of them and jumped at my chance for freedom for the first time. I\u2019m sorry that your sister is upset but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be made uncomfortable or unhappy to make her happy.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed agency and independence in your life. You are allowed to express how you felt about your situation, even if it differs from her. You were not being malicious, you were being honest and explaining yourself.", "NTA.\n\nThe truth is the truth even if it\u2019s harsh and nobody can change how you feel.\n\nIt certainly seems like this issue was ignored too long and probably should\u2019ve been addressed in family therapy years (if not over a decade) ago in an ideal world; but it is what it is.\n\nI would caution you to carefully search your soul and be totally sure about how you handle your relationship with your family because it sounds like they care and want to be involved in your life. Not everyone can claim that, but they do have to respect your boundaries too.\n\nBest of luck navigating this.", "Esh. I'm sorry your parents are assholes thatvraised you really weird, but it's really not fair to blame your sister for their actions. Yoir sister needs to hear what you're saying and respect your boundaries and space but you need to also show her some sympathy and compassion because she had no choice in howbyour parents raised you and is an equal victim in this. It doesn't matter that she enjoyed being so close tonyou, she is an equal victim here.", "This feels fake to me, but assuming it's real, you need to stop blaming your sister when this is 100% your parents' fault.

But I don't like her or enjoy spending time with her. It has always been a burden to me to have that expectation to put her first, and to dedicate so much time to her. I like it better when we're not together and honestly when we're not talking. It's not her fault that we were set up to have a relationship that only she liked. That is something our parents set us up for. But I also can't find it in me to like her enough to guide her into a more normal and independent relationship.

This decision certainly makes things much easier for you because it means you don't have to spend the time and effort to help your sister; instead all you have to do is deliberately hurt her enough that she stops wanting to talk to you.
