{"id": 21011, "submission_id": "14nenpd", "title": "AITA for getting angry that she got coffee and donuts, when I hadn't eaten all day?", "selftext": "I work a severely physically demanding job. My wife stays home with the kids. Not trying to make a comparison, fyi. SAHMs have a rough job. Just shedding insight on the dynamic. I prefer she stays home. She's a fantastic mom and wife. Damn good woman. \n\nAnyways, I've been trying to save money to buy us a plot of land. I make almost $600 a day so I've been able to save a lot but I am becoming frustrated with my hours. Because of my job, I have very little time to eat- if any. Every day I come home absolutely famished because I hardly have time to stop what I'm doing and eat and where I work in the sun all day, it makes my attitude a bit peaked. I make a point not to bring it home with me. \n\nBut today is my 18th without a day off and day 3 of me not being able to eat on shift. I come home at 5:30pm. Well, I came home this afternoon and she hadn't prepared anything for dinner because she lost track of time (playing with the kids outdoors), which is absolutely fine. But I was a bit put off when I walked in to the kitchen and found a 12 count donut and an iced coffee sitting on the counter. All eaten, it was just the left over garbage that hadn't been put away. So I asked my wife when they had gotten the coffee and donuts and she said \"maybe an hour or two ago\". So I made a back handed comment of \"well, at least you guys have eaten something then\" and walk off to the garage. I can 100% make myself something to eat. I'm not incapable. It just rubbed me the wrong way. When I came back inside 10 minutes ago she had my dinner sitting in the microwave and she was getting the kids dressed to leave. When I asked where she was going, she said \"wherever I want. Go eat so you're not such a fucking prick when I return because we shouldn't have to deal with an attitude\".

Okay, no big deal.. maybe mention you are really hungry and ask what the dinner plans are. \n\nThen you find out she got a treat for herself and kids. You didn\u2019t get any. So what?

Or, have a talk with your boss and let him know that you need at least a 15-minute break for lunch in the middle of your shift to eat.

You could pack something for the ride home, but when your wife\u2019s job is playing with the kids all day, she needs to grow up and have some empathy. My mom is a single mom and a nurse and sometimes she\u2019s so busy she can\u2019t get a lunch break. I always have dinner ready for her because it\u2019s the right thing to do.

Now where you could be the AH is  not taking at least 30 minutes for lunch or sporadic drink and lite snacks through the day (not to mention u healthy when it's hot). And also if you yelled or slammed around although I would be peeved too if I came home to an empty donut box. To leave a donut or two for dad also teaches the children to be courteous of others in the family and not self centered.", "Maybe you should take this is a huge sign that your current work situation isn't sustainable. \n\nMy friends dad would overwork himself and was a nightmare to be around.

He chose to do it, then he'd take it out on them by snapping and being angry that they'd done normal things. \n\nI compared him to my dad, so did my friend. As kids we thought he was an arsehole. Now I think he was so fixated on material things bringing happiness to his family, that he pushed away the people he was working so hard for.\n\nYou need to prioritise your health and eating. There's no point in working this hard, if you're ruining yourself to do this. I know you really want this, but you don't want your kids to ever see you as the man they fear because when he comes home their mum gets more serious. And they have to be careful in case he snaps.\n\nIf dinner isn't ready in future, snack. Are you not taking lunch with you?

Based on how she reacted I\u2019m going to guess she was feeling burnt out too. Perhaps, that\u2019s why she got the donuts and coffee - to make her and the kids day a bit easier. (I do think she should have saved you some.)\n\nRegardless, it sounds like there is a bigger underlying issue at hand here and you should apologize for your comment (hopefully she will apologize as well) and sit down and discuss how you are both feeling and what you both need from each other. \n\nYou are a team.

If I came home to find that empty donut box taunting me, I probably would have just started sobbing. And I'd still rather be in his shoes than his wife's, because she's essentially a single mom at this point, with an extra grown-ass, surly kid to take care of because her husband is stretched so thin he apparently can't even feed himself. You could not pay me enough to deal with that shit, I'd have noped out to stay with a relative two weeks in. And not even out of anger, just to have someone actually around to help with kids and let me take a fucking break once in a while.\n\nIf a petty little spat over donuts is the worst consequence of this insanity, they're honestly both doing fine.

He is an adult, he is responsible to make sure he eats and is sustaining himself. Donuts isn\u2019t going to sustain him and isn\u2019t proper food for him to eat when he is coming back from work after starving himself anyway. That\u2019s how you get stomach aches. What he should be doing is buying himself some protein bars, peanuts to keep in his car so that he can fill himself with something on the drive to and from work.

It's not hard to keep stuff tucked in a container or something.", "> Yes but also isnt it like common decency to leave atleast something for your partner.\n\nHe didn't come home and have to fend for himself.  She put on supper for him.  It was late on this one day because she lost track of time.  Bloody hell.", "I dunno, the flip from her side is that he said in another comment that she has dinner waiting on the table for him every single night as soon as he gets home, and this was a one-off situation where she lost track of time and didn\u2019t. So she treats herself and the kids for once, and yea maybe could\u2019ve left him one, but figures she\u2019ll have dinner waiting like she always does.  She loses track of time and then is greeted with that attitude?\n\nHe obviously doesn\u2019t give enough info, but I think the dude is clearly overworked and letting it affect his home life. Also with him working so many days straight than means she gets zero break from caring for the kids (and who knows how helpful he is once he gets home if he\u2019s so exhausted) which is a level of sheer exhaustion on her side as well. Long hours for him means long hours for her.\n\nFor the sake of his and his family\u2019s health he needs to cut back.", "He doesn\u2019t have to. Sounds like he\u2019s choosing this for himself.

The rest of his family\u2019s wants and needs seem pretty secondary to what he wants. \n\nAny adult can manage not to starve even when they can\u2019t take lunch breaks. There are plenty of nutrient-dense foods you can eat in seconds. He\u2019s just choosing not to, and blame his hunger and frustrations on his wife.", "He doesn't have to work that much. He chooses to work that much. He says he makes $600 a day. He's wealthy enough that he could be cutting back his hours substantially. If he's making $600 a day, there's no reason why he couldn't just order delivery literally every day. At that rate, he could have A housekeeper in addition to a stay-at-home wife.\n\nThere's no reason to burn yourself out that goddamn much.\n\nHe's literally angry that his wife and children... Ate food, throughout the day, you know, like people do.", "He\u2019s choosing to do it.", "Nah, he _chooses_ not to eat. He _chose_ not to take a day off in 18 days.

Also, no days off for him means no \u201cdays off\u201d for her as the sole daytime childcare provider either. Does she agree that this is worth it?", "This is why I stopped making my ex husbands lunches.
