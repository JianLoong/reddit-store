It's fair for you to ask for her to cover a larger portion of the rent given the income disparity, but it's also fair for her to expect to split it 50/50. This is something that should be discussed well in advance of moving in and if you're uncomfortable with the price you'd be paying at a 50/50 split, you should suggest looking for a place at a lower price point where you'll still be able to meet your own financial goals.\n\nIf y'all aren't able to work this one out, then... well. Seems like there's a bigger conversation to be had.", "INFO: Who chose the new apartment, or were you in full agreement when you found it?", "INFO: Did you bring this up as you were searching for places, or after you already chose a place together? This is something that should be hashed out before the fact: what are each of you comfortable paying, and what will you do if the rent is greater than your limit?", "INFO have you already signed a lease?", "NAH.. this is open to negotiation. If the apartment is more expensive by her choice then maybe she wants to keep this one and agrees to a bit of the additional costs. Or maybe you can look at cheaper places so that it is more affordable to you. As long as this isnt contentious it is something that can be discussed. \nMaybe it's not time to get a place together.", "NTA.  Sounds like she wants a roommate not a partner.", "NTA. But I would suggest putting your foot down now. Moving into the new place will cost you much more than you are paying now. Tell her that if she is not able to split it more fairly, you guys will have to find a cheaper place/place in your budget. Make it less about the way it is split and the fact that it\u2019s an irresponsible financial decision for yourself. If she wants to live in a nicer place she can pick up the extra cost.\n\nEdited to add: if she is not willing to pick up even $50 extra to support you, she is not a partner. She may think of her left over income as \u201cher\u201d money but once you live together for a while, it really is \u201cboth of your\u201d money. Do you want to be with somebody this stingy? What if you become disabled and cannot work? What if you have kids? This might be a bigger conversation.", "YTA, if you are unhappy with the rent price then you should have picked somewhere else.", "NTA.  \"*She deserves her money because of how hard she works*\"???  Was she implying you don't work hard or as hard as her?  I think moving in together, at least right now, would be disastrous.  50/50 isn't fair if one person has a higher income than the other.  She should pay more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If you are not married and your finances are separate you shouldn\u2019t expect her to pay more than 50% of the rent and bills, regardless of income disparity. \n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable with the amount of rent for the place y\u2019all are planning to move to then that should be a discussion with your partner.

Maybe compromise with a lower budget place that you would be comfortable splitting the rent 50-50 on? Either way this should be part of a larger discussion about expectations and finances going forward. Because you may not always have the option to live in a lower price place in the area you both want. Especially with rent prices and mortgage rates nowadays.
