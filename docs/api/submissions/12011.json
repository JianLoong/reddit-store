He seems to be in denial, it's one thing to collect things, or want the next new thing, but animals are not things. It's already hard on an animal to be rehomed and he needs to recognize that he has already caused the bird harm. \n\nOn top of that dogs need extensive training when they are young and if that's neglected it's detrimental to them as they grow, you don't want to end up with a poorly trained or reactive dog.", "NTA.\n\n>I basically told him that he was at fault for this whole scenario with the bird and let our kid down\n\nThis is correct.", "NTA i hate people who get pets neglect them then get the new cute pet. \ud83e\udd2e", "Not at all. It speaks to the irresponsibility of your family members that they would buy only one lovebird anyway because (as the name suggests) they NEED other avian companions or they, as you described, become asocial and snippy. Drives me up the wall to hear about people hoarding animals as \"animal lovers\" when they can't take proper care of them.", "NTA\n\nI have my own views about birds being as pets...\nBut it truly says something that someone who doesn't like/is scared of and never wanted a bird cares more about its welfare than your spouse who claims to love them  \n\nIts incredibly cruel to neglect an animal  especially to the point its aggressive or nippy. It's so so cruel. And shame on your husband. \n\nplease find this poor thing a better home. It's bad enough they're stuck in a cage but then to be ignored after a year or two of constant affection. they're such wonderful beautiful creatures and shouldn't be owned as pets. The only time I've ever been okay with this is the rare time someone is truly good with them. They're allowed out of a cage in a large area more than inside a cage, have attention paid to them, etc.  It breaks my heart. \n\nPLEASE point out to your husband how beautiful this creatures are and how cruel it is that they're caged but then to be ignored. He is NOT a bird lover. Period. \n\nI saved two love birds that were thrown into a trashcan. I named them Kuka which is Hungarian for trashcan and Poubelle which is French for trashcan. I'm French and Hungarian. Sweetest little babies. They were in a small tight cardboard box. I found them a home with an actual bird lover who did right by them. \n\nThese poor birds. Very rarely sre owners deserving of them. They belong in the wild.", "NTA. After you re-home the bird perhaps get an adult dog instead of a puppy. Puppies are hard work and there are lots of great, cute dogs that need homes.", "Literally. My step dad was a big animal person - my mom, too, just not as much. So we always had lots of different animals growing up and they\u2019re also people that don\u2019t believe in re-homing pets, so most we had for their entire lifespans. That\u2019s how to be a good pet parent. We even had a tarantula, my mom hates spiders. But she was fine with it because she said she could respect it, just didn\u2019t want to care for it or pet it. She was never expected to. My step dad and I did that. She lived for 18 years. The only pets we ever re-homed were the two ball pythons we had and there was a good reason for that. Everyone in the house loved those things but for their sake, we had to get rid of them- so we opted to give them to a teacher at the school my mom worked at because she knew he\u2019d care for them well and they became the class pets.\n\nI cannot stand people who get a pet, get bored of it, and get another one.\n\nGood on you for putting your foot down, OP. Your husband needs a reality check. NTA.", "I wasn't responsible for the research and neither was my child. My husband has owned single love birds in the past and thought it would bond with our kid and be OK. I trusted what he said.\n\nAnd my kid wanted a parakeet initially because of the companionship thing, but my husband talked them into a love bird.", "Yeah, believe me if I would have had any clue about love birds the situation would be very different.", "The puppy is mainly because my kid really misses our dog who died last year from cancer. It was terminal and inoperable. I was the one nursing the dog to keep her comfortable until she died and it's why I'm not ready for another dog yet. But I AM actually a responsible pet owner. I'm just terrified of birds and refuse to take care of them.\n\nHe didn't have birds when I was dating/engaged to him and I told him that I don't want any birds in the house unless he was solely taking care of them and we had enough room so they could be out and I could avoid them. And when our child wanted one, he assured me that he would help. I'm not so selfish that I would keep my kid from getting a pet they want even if I don't like the idea.", "We have other pets than the bird. It's just that I don't help out with the bird because I'm terrified them. We have a cat we rescued (doing great) and we did have a dog, but she had terminal cancer and died last year. I was the one who was taking care of our dog as she was dying. That's why I'm not ready yet for another dog. My heart isn't ready yet cause I still miss her so much.", "They're a child. It's not their fault because they were doing the best they knew how to do. I certainly don't know how to take care of birds, but my husband does. \n\nAlso, we've had a dog before this. I was the one who nursed her through her dying of cancer at 12 years old so don't speak on things you don't know about. I was the one who figured out a special diet for my girl. I was the one who was making appointments with dog cancer doctors in California to see how they could help her. I was the one making sure she ate and drank and was comfortable.", "DH is a huge AH and stop calling him a bird lover because it doesn\u2019t look like he loves anything but himself.", "Yes but now you know so I think it\u2019s within your rights to rehome the bird.", "You pressure the family all the time to take care of their current pet. You took care of the dog in her last years. You are NTA, they are not viewing pets as living things you need to care for."]}
