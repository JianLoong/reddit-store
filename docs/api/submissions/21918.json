There is no 12 weeks law. It is just something SOME people do, SOMETIMES. \n\n3) the world doesn\u2019t resolve around you. They cannot stop to live because of your loss. \n\n\n4) your text was very inappropriate. They didn\u2019t tell you. They protected you. Not their fault if your mom told you.\n\n5) based of your behavior even if they have waited until the birth to announce their new baby you would have been angry because it\u2019s all about you, you, you!\n\n\n6) Be mad at your mom for telling you not at your brother and SIL for not telling you.\n\n\n7) Wait a few weeks and send a text saying you\u2019re sorry for your last message and if you feel better, congratulate them. \nDon\u2019t be too hopeful for a quick answer you might have hurt them deeply with your cruel words.", "YTA.\nThey didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did. Why are you not accusing her of stirring the pot? \nAnd honestly, given how angry you are right now, would a few weeks have really made a difference? Would you really have been okay with the news? \nThe fact they haven\u2019t responded yet also speaks volumes to me. They know you\u2019re upset. They didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did. And that\u2019s also probably why she\u2019s defending them. She knows she messed up telling you the news, and sees you\u2019re taking it out on the wrong person.", "YTA. \n\nYou used your own pain to colour your interpretation of events and you turned your pain against them in a most vicious way. \n\nAll you had to say was, congratulations. One word. That\u2019s all it would have taken. You didn\u2019t even have to mean it but it was the mature and polite thing to do. \n\nInstead you have upset everyone in the family.

Yes, they could have waited a while but you ending a relationship with your brother and his wife for not announcing their pregnancy on a schedule that YOU would have found acceptable is over the top.", "YTA. Yes because people can totally plan when they get pregnant \ud83d\ude44 also, there is no \u201crule\u201d about when you announce you\u2019re pregnant.", "I understand your loss and the difficulties TTC. I really and truly do. \n\nHowever, you messaging them to call them cruel assholes was 100% uncalled for. I understand you are hurting and grieving, but they did nothing wrong. Tradition is not law, and you were told in a manner to allow you to deal with your emotions without an audience.\n\nThey don't have to wait to announce their pregnancy, and honestly a couple of weeks wouldn't have made any difference because it would still be soon after your loss. There is no way for them to handle this that wouldn't have hurt you.\n\nSo even though I am really sympathetic to your loss, I am going to vote YTA.", "Gentle YTA. I'm so very sorry for your loss. Be kind to yourself, but I think you will regret how harsh you were. If you two have been this close, is this really how you want the relationship to end?\n\nI agree that it would have been better for them to wait, but I'm not sure the news would have been any easier on you a month from now. It was always going to hurt, a lot. Sharing it while you weren't present shows some consideration for your feelings, so I think they were probably trying to do what they thought would be easier on you even if they messed up.", "You're feelings are valid....I am so sorry for your loss. It doesn't excuse your behavior tho. \n\nYes....it would've been nice of they waited tilv12 weeks but your mother is correct....today or 5 weeks from now you still would've been upset. And most people could care less about tradition now. It all would've still been too soon. But they can't put their life on hold. \n\nAnd you said how close you and your brother are. I doubt he is being cruel.  Honestly....they may be thinking they are adding a lil sunshine to the family's sorrow.", "So sorry for your loss, but please don't turn your hurt onto your brother and his wife. You mother is right: it really wouldn't matter when he shared his news. It's heartbreaking for you either way. Take care.", "NAH. You're grieving and it was kind of a harsh move to announce their pregnancy right after what you've been through, but you can't be mad with them not waiting 12 weeks.", "YTA.  Geez.  It is one thing to not congratulate them but it is beyond an AH move to text them and calling them cruel AH. You are beyond an AH. \n\nI hope your brother and wife cut you off permanently even if at some point in time you come to your senses on how ridiculous your action were.", "oh god, definitely NTA. I wonder if this was the extended family wanting to \"move on\" to a different baby, which is such an incredibly fucked up mindset to have. Like, do they not understand that things hurt less given more time? \nI kinda agree that this was always going to be painful for you, but it could have been *less* painful.\n\nIf they had announced 5 weeks later, I would have said N A H, but the fact that they announced earlier than normal and the fact that your mother thinks she has any fucking right to tell you how you can and cannot feel when you are recovering from an extremely traumatic event makes them AH's.\n\nSidenote: The trend of religious people having no understanding of trauma (especially other people's) is so frustrating. IMO any god who would allow you to go through what you went through isn't worth praying to.", "NTA NTA NTA: I\u2019m incredibly sorry for your loss. I\u2019m actually surprised there\u2019s so many Y  T  As here.\n\nWhile your reaction may seem extreme towards your brother, what you\u2019ve been through *is* extreme. Infertility, almost IVF, falling pregnant, needing to terminate and giving birth. And your brother couldn\u2019t wait for the cremation before sharing his pregnancy news?! It\u2019s cruel.\n\nWithout reading too much into your sibling relationship, I think you need a break from him, especially since you\u2019ll be watching his wife\u2019s pregnancy.\n\nAgain, sorry for your loss.", "This seems like an unpopular opinion but NTA. I completely understand that what OP texted was very hurtful to her brother and his wife. But in my opinion\u2026 the hurt the text would cause them is not comparable to the pain she\u2019s experiencing by going through a stillbirth. People often say terrible things when they\u2019re suffering. Does that make it ok? Of course not. Does that mean the victim of their words aren\u2019t allowed to be hurt? Of course not. But I think that unless OP has always been a \u201cself centered\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d person, then it\u2019s very clear this text was only a response to her horrific suffering right now. If I were in her brother or SIL\u2019s shoes I would be very hurt, I would probably put some distance throughout the pregnancy, but then ultimately I will try to reconcile. At the end of the day, *someone* needs to take the higher road, and despite the fact that OP is the one who technically did something wrong, I think the disparity between her suffering and the way her brother and SIL will suffer from these texts means that it is her brother and SIL who should have more empathy once they are ready to communicate with OP again.", "I think your reaction is completely understandable, even though it may be a little bit over the top. Even though I\u2019m a 18yo guy and don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be pregnant, I think that what your brother and sister in law did was unnecessarily cruel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did, so you could have time to privately process it rather than hearing it in a group. This gave you the opportunity to think before you lashed out. But you did it anyway. It is so sad that you lost your baby. But this is happy news for your brother and you should have recognized that. The world moves on. Clearly she was already pregnant before you even lost your child and even if not, they are not going to put their family on hold for a year so you can mourn. \n\nSend your brother an apology and congratulations. Then give yourself some space. I get that you are deeply sad but you have no right to lash out at others like that. You just aren\u2019t thinking straight right now.", "When I was grieving, it felt strange seeing people doing their thing, smiling, laughing, celebrating, enjoying the weather...because my own world had turned black. There was this weird contrast between the hell I felt internally and the sheer normalcy around me.\n\nThen I thought...I wonder how many times I've passed a person who was dealing with their own hell while I was obliviously enjoying my life? 1000s of times. Our grief is our own. We don't stop our lives for others, either...all we can do is be sensitive.\n\nGrief can't be shared or we'd all be depressed, all the time. It's just one of those things. I'm very sorry for your loss - loss is hell but try not to push people away...it's easy to become bitter and want to blame others but it doesn't change anything. You won't forget your baby, that's all that matters.", "NAH \n\nJust a really horrible situation overall. I'm sure there is a reason for the announcement being at this time (my sister announced at I think 8 weeks, so not uncommon) and they seemed to do everything in their power to protect you. \n\nWas your response aggressive and unnecessary? Yeah. But you are going through what I'm sure is the hardest time of your life right now, and grief can hit in such weird ways. I remember lashing out at my younger cousin for saying the word 'nan' after my Gran passed away. It can really hit you. \n\nDoes that excuse what you said? Not at all. But I think once you give yourself some time you can mend things. Even a message stating that things are hard right now and to give you some time while you grieve and you can make things right when you are beginning to heal. Something to show them you're sorry while you are still unable to confront the situation.\n\nShit situations and shit reactions don't make you a bad person. It's how you react to what you've done. I'm sure you'll be alright, friend. Make sure you mend things with your brother and SIL, and give yourself some leniency, you're grieving and healing. Slow and steady.", "Kindly, you should not be seeking judgment right now. What you\u2019ve been through is physically, emotionally, and psychologically horrible and your emotions are fully on the surface. \n\nBut you did come here for judgment. So- ESH. You for the text.

If OP always believes that her brother is cruel, it will be impossible for her brother to take the high road. I completely understand OP is not in her right mind now. And that is completely understandable. But at some point she should reassess her actions. Otherwise she will alienate everyone and her depression will be even worse.", "I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nYou're angry. You're furious that this has happened, because how could it? How could it happen to you? Why did it happen? How is it right or fair? That is grief. \n\nYou've taken that anger and aimed it at your brother. You look at him having this child, and you're angry. He already has one. How can he have another when you just lost yours? All you want is one baby, and now he gets to have two, and it isn't fair! It isn't fair that they are experiencing that joy when you are mourning the loss of all your child was to you already, and all they could have been. How is that right or fair? That is grief. \n\nYou can tell me if I'm wrong, but that is what I think is going through your head. Grief is normal, but you cannot allow it to make you irrational and unreasonable. You cannot allow it to make you bitter and angry. Something truly awful has happened, and that pain may ease, but it won't go away, so if you cannot get a handle on this, it will poison all the relationships in your life. You have to learn to manage the pain and eventually find happiness. \n\nYour brother doesn't deserve your anger. It isn't his fault.

I know I experienced postpartum depression as well, which I unfortunately did not treat. Termination is illegal in my state and I wasn\u2019t able to talk about my experience or share it with many people, which made my feelings of grief and depression so much worse than I think it would have been if I could have done it differently.

You don't necessarily need a therapist to help you deal with grief and loss(because you mentioned in another comment that you don't get free therapy and that it's expensive). You just need each other. Go on a week long trip to some remote area with your husband for some alone time and some quiet. I come from a country where therapy is not widespread and it's basically a rich man's treatment or for people who are clinically diagnosed with something.

And then to top it off they were too cowardly to tell you themselves, and got your mum to do it.\n\nYour mum is an AH as well, she should have shut it down immediately, and definitely not told you if those other AHs couldn\u2019t be persuaded to delay their news, and her continued support of them is disgusting.\n\n2 weeks\u2026.. that is barely enough time to understand what happened, forget about actually processing it and dealing with the tremendous amount of emotional and physical trauma you are experiencing, you are likely still wondering if it is just a horrible nightmare that you will wake up from.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think your message went far enough - I would have attacked their god as well, as what god would ever do anything like that.\n\nThe only thing that the people who are telling you that you are an AH have right is that you and your husband need therapy to help you come to terms with it, and try to move forward with your lives.", "INFO\n\nWhat happened to you is *bitterly* unfair. It's diabolically cruel. If they did ask your mother to tell you at 7 weeks, I don't see you being the AH in any way at all. If they didn't and your mother just decided to tell you, then as gently as I can say it, that is AH behaviour and quite frankly, your mother is the AH.\n\nAnd, god, you must have heard this a thousand times, but I'm so very sorry for what happened. You've been through a lot, way too much, so take your time to heal and be kind to your mental and physical states and remember there's no time limit on grief. You were getting out of bed again which is such a huge and important step when all you want is to hide from the world.", "Reddit is so strange NTA you are not suppose to announce until 12 weeks. They decide to tell everyone when you literally just lost your baby at 7 weeks when it is there second?! Now, would it have been any easier to hear, no, it wouldn\u2019t but my god if you were my sister I never would have even considered saying anything so early.", "YTA - the main character syndrom. They didnt even tell you, it was your Mother. If anyone was a soft asshole it would be your Mom maybe. I bet if they waited till 12 weeks or whatever you would react the same.", "I am so, so sorry for what you have been through. Ruling NAH, because your brother wasn't trying to be cruel.", "NTA death of a baby trumps news of another every time\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if because you mention they\u2019re \u2018super religious\u2019 if they\u2019re punishing you for terminating (even tho there was literally no other option) \n\nMaybe your text was a little harsh but still NTA", "NTA, and I'm not sure your brother is either, since it was your mother who told you, which was cruel since it was so close to your own loss.

I'm very sorry for your loss.", "Normally I might say YTA, but post partum is a bitch so NTA.", "YTA in a way but it\u2019s sort of okay cause your grieving but still YTA. They were respectful of your loss and didn\u2019t tell you themselves. No matter when they chose to tell people you\u2019d probably still be mad. Your grief is where your behavior is coming from and it\u2019s not okay. It\u2019s okay to feel but you need to get some help and this is coming from someone who is also experiencing grief and not handling it well. So I feel okay in saying YTA. Cause Im an asshole too. Grief is wild and makes you think and behave in such irrational ways. We are justified in how we feel in that moment but need to come back to reality at some point and see where we were so wrong. They aren\u2019t being selfish in living their life but you\u2019re taking it personal because of your loss. You cannot remove your hurt from their happiness and until you deal with it you won\u2019t ever be happy for them. You need to apologize. You don\u2019t have to wish her well but you need to say sorry for how you behaved. Im sure they\u2019ll be more than understanding since they already thought of you in the beginning. Be kinder to yourself. Confide in people with how you feel. Get a journal. Go seek counseling. Life is still going to move on regardless of the loss we experience. Everyone is still going to push forward while you feel stuck in time. Find a good way to cope. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I hope you take care of yourself.", " YTA. Sorry for your loss that is a tragedy, but being mad at someone else for being pregnant is not the way to go. And that waiting for 12 weeks thing is not a rule, I wait until then to announce publically but I tell my close family members as soon as I find out I\u2019m expecting for a number of reasons. (One reason being that morning sickness is really bad during the first trimester why should a pregnant woman suffer in silence until the second trimester?) also did you ever think that your mom and other members of the family may have been affected by the loss as well, obviously not anywhere near as severely as you, but that was her grandchild as well and people cope a lot of different ways.", "I am so sorry for your loss, but YTA in this situation.

So unless you're very close to (or over) 40, I feel that your level of anxiety and obsession with getting pregnant are extreme and unhealthy for you, and will be unhealthy for any future pregnancy. (Actually, even if you are around 40 it still sounds extreme)\n\nI'm very sorry for what you're going through, I can't even imagine how traumatic a loss under these circumstances can be. But I think you need to first heal mentally and change your mindset before trying again, or you'll risk starting a second pregnancy with even more stress and anxiety than the first one, and that *will* affect the baby.\n\nAs for this particular situation, I'm wondering if maybe your brother and SIL didn't decide to share their news early to bring some happiness to the rest of your family who are grieving your loss? I know to you it felt like a low blow, but also you can't expect them to put their lives on hold while you go through this.", "YTA.  It wouldn't have mattered when they announced the pregnancy,  It's going to be brutal on you.  That's just straight up truth and you have every right to be angry with the world.  You don't have the right to take it out on your brother and his wife.  The way you messaged them was rude and uncalled for.", "YTA but grief can make people irrational. My brother and SIL have struggled to conceive, and when I got unexpectedly pregnant, I was excited but also immediately very sad for them. I didn\u2019t want to tell them. I didn\u2019t want to see the pain on their faces. But I was still entitled to be excited about my baby, while still mourning their losses. She\u2019s two now and honestly, they still hurt sometimes being around her. I made them godparents and they have a special relationship with her, but I know they carry pain and resentment. And that\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t imagine struggling to conceive, losing multiple babies, and then someone you\u2019re close to just becomes pregnant easily. Life is very complicated and hard sometimes. Your brother and his wife deserve to be excited right now. That doesn\u2019t take anything away from what you\u2019ve been through.

It's grief, anger, rage, and hate that is going to put a wedge between you and your loved ones. \n\nPlease find a support group. They can be lanterns in this very dark time.\n\nThe message to your brother was uncalled for. BUT I can see why you sent it.", "Full on AH. YTA. Yes, it absolutely is horrible you lost your baby. ESP in that matter. But expecting others to hide their happiness just to make you feel better? That screams entitled brat to me.", "Soft YTA, I really hope you can talk to a therapist.  Please get some help. Don't deal with this on your own. Please make sure your spouse has some support, too.\n\nTell your mum you are getting help, and plan to apologize to both your brother and SIL. You need to. You know, in your heart,  that you were in the wrong. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. I wish nothing but healing to you.", "I'm sorry but, YTA.  You can't expect people to put their lives on hold bc you're hurting.  It's true, it doesn't matter when they announce it, it's going to hurt.  Not everyone waits the 12 weeks to announce a pregnancy.  There's no rule about that.  Just bc they did it with the first one doesn't mean they have to wait to announce the second one.  As difficult as it's going to be to watch her go through her pregnancy, they have done nothing wrong.", "OP. My heart breaks for you. Life is so cruel and unfair, and you are undergoing the harshest thing a human has to suffer - the loss of a child. And without minimising your grief and sorrow - YTA. \n\nBut I believe it is a YTA without malice, and one brought on by the fog of sadness you are mired in. \n\nI think you yourself will realise as time passes that you acted in haste and allowed your grief to guide your rage. \n\nGently, what you are saying is irrational. 12 weeks is an arbitrary measure that society imposes on women, and guilts them and shames them of outcomes regardless. As your tragic story shows, noone is \"safe\" at any point. Plus this is not \"announcing\". This is merely sharing with your close family members - I had told my parents and my sibling that I was pregnant pretty much by the time the pee was dry on the stick. \n\nSecond pregnancies are harder to hide and if they have a little one at home, they may not want her to spill the beans. \n\nThey also showed so much compassion to your situation and allowed your mother to break the news to you individually. They did not tell you, they did not approach you, they didn't rub it in your face. They are clearly good people. \n\nYour reaction was totally off the handle, but given your grief, and your close relationship with your brother I'm sure they will forgive you. Reach out and apologize. \n\nAnd when you feel like -  share with them, and your family, and even here with us if you would like about your baby. What was their name? I'm sharing something I read - and I hope it gives you comfort - all they knew was love \ud83d\udc96.

I don\u2019t feel they should\u2019ve announced it as you\u2019re going through what you are, especially since your baby hasn\u2019t even had an autopsy yet. But maybe they were trying to bring some light to a dark time in your families life. \n\nI would be just as angry as you though if they had announced it then. But I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve sent the text message - no one can say what they would do in a moment like what you\u2019re experiencing right now. \n\nMaybe send a text to brother and apologize - but tell him you need space from his family during this time. \n\nAgain, I hope you do start feeling better and are able to get some therapy or have someone you can talk to because it\u2019s not fair what happened to you and your feelings are valid.", "Understandable, but YTA. I wouldn't call you TA for not congratulating your brother, but for sure for the mean words and claims of ending the relationship. You definitely owe your brother an apology, but hopefully he understands and won't give you a hard time.", "YTA No wonder your brother didn't want to be the one to tell you. You would have found something to be mad at 12 weeks for, too. Your brother not having problems and living his life is not slapping you in the face.", "Gentle YTA. Your brother didn\u2019t cause what happened to you, nor did he wave his pregnancy in your face to gloat. You\u2019re grieving, and grief can make people irrational. I would apologize to your brother and wife, and then kindly ask them to give you space right now until you\u2019ve had some time to process your own pain.", "YTA, your loss is awful but not anyone else\u2019s issue to work around.\n\nHonestly, if I were then I wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with you right now given your reaction. \n\nThey deserve happiness during their pregnancy even if you had a different experience.\n\nSigned- went through infertility and you are way out of line", "It doesn\u2019t ever seem right to call someone who lost a child an AH but yes, YTA. It seems like they definitely took what precautions they could not to upset you as much as possible. You say you wish they waited 5 more weeks, but honey you lost a child, your grief isn\u2019t going to be any less when they are 12 weeks pregnant or now. For you, there will never be a right time for them to announce, it will hurt you either way. \n\nYou need to understand that for others life does go on. I remember when we took my mom off life support and she passed, I was in the Hall and I watched nurses calmly talk where they wanted to order their lunch from. It was a reminder that while it seems like the world stopped for me, it\u2019s still spinning for everyone else.", "YTA. Your pain is not an excuse to lash out. You would end your relationship with your sibling because their wife is pregnant? That\u2019s awful. \n\nYou have a lot of growing up to do. How are you going to be a good parent if you treat those closest to you like garbage just because you\u2019re grieving?", "YTA, while what happened to you is tragic and you have to grieve in your own time we all know that this was going to be painful no matter when they announced. Your loss doesn\u2019t mean others have to hide their pregnancies or children. To cut your brother off over his wife being pregnant is unreasonable and when your grief settles you will realize that. When you get pregnant again you\u2019ll want people to be happy for you, but that will be difficult for someone else.

You don\u2019t know me, and have no reason to believe me\u2026but I get it. What you\u2019re doing here is taking all that anger and pain that you (rightly) have for the cruelty and unfairness of losing your baby, and have projected it onto two people that haven\u2019t actually done anything wrong.

I'm not familiar with the feeling of loosing a child, but I truly feel your pain and I hope you'll get through this horrible time\n\nThat said, what the actual fuck did I just read in the end? You sent an abusive message to your brother because he dared to say him and his wife are having another baby? I know that you're in grief, I truly get that, but that doesn't give you a pass to be so vile. \n\nYour title is also misleading. Its not that you didn't congratulate him, it's that you sent a horrible message calling him names and breaking your bond. Truly, you need serious help. Also, since they weren't even the ones to tell you, it truly seems like they might have waited but your mom figured she could still tell you. Most likely had hope you wouldn't be so horrible.", "Yta. People trying to get pregnant unsuccessfully go through some crazy brain chemistry that seems to prevent them from being happy for anyone else, which leads to people letting a lot of bad manners and impropriety slide. The fact is that you don't have a right to be nasty to people just because you haven't had a successful pregnancy. It's your personal tragedy, not anyone else's. Other people going through good things is not an attack against you.", "Yup, YTA, a bit. This is a big moment for them and you want them to walk on eggshells for you by calculating just precisely the timing they use to let the world know of their wonderful moment. If you worked in an office and one of your associates got the promotion you wanted, I am guessing you would not congratulate them and think even their achievement should not be celebrated near you. I'm sorry to say, the world doesn't revolve around you and however sad your setback is, that is a happy moment for someone else. If you're that sensitive, then good luck in life. It's not just about you.", "Light YTA\n\nSometimes pregnancies are announced as soon as the couple find out they're pregnant. I'm so sorry for your loss. It sucks and while you want the world to just stop, it won't. Life doesn't stop and you can't control when someone shares their news. They know you're hurting, so they made sure you weren't there when they broke the news. \n\nDo you think you would have felt any better even if they had waited a few weeks? Few months even? You went through a horrible loss.

And that grief will never really go away. But the world around you carries on. You will see people pregnant and people giving birth to healthy babies and it will hit you hard. Life isn\u2019t fair. But it\u2019s also not fair to expect the rest of the world to stop just because yours has. \n\nYour brother didn\u2019t want to tell you. But he is allowed to be excited for his own happy time and to want to share it with the people he cares about. There\u2019s no rule about when to announce a pregnancy and it could even be that they\u2019ve watched your suffering and wanted to bring their own support system into the loop a little earlier so that they know they have people who love them around them. Having a baby is a scary time, even if everything goes perfectly. But if it doesn\u2019t, having people around you to support you is exactly what you need. Don\u2019t deny them that just because you\u2019re hurting. \nAllow yourself time to grieve and for your body to heal.

I understand the simultaneous noisy and silent mound of racing thoughts.\n\n**Your feelings are valid and so are your emotions**, but don't project them on others. If you're feeling overwhelmed by emotions/depression, then find an outlet that's harmless (writing, painting, cooking, exercise, photography, etc.) or even one of those \"smash rooms\" to get it out. Idk if you've tried it yet, but connecting with other women in an anonymous group setting may also help you with being able to talk with others you can relate to on a deeper level who have experienced this.\n\nYou are going to get through this. You are not alone. It just requires time and introspection.", "We lost our first pregnancy very early on. I had so much uncertainty that we would ever be able to conceive due to my PCOS and other factors. So when we found out we were expecting, I was overjoyed. Everything felt like it finally made sense. Then the rug was ripped out from under us.   \n\nMy husband\u2019s side of the family didn\u2019t know what we were going through. 2 months later, BIL and his wife announced they were expecting their second child. I was so, so bitter. Of course they had no idea, and I congratulated them. \n\nI had to unfollow a lot of new moms/expecting couples on Facebook because even though people didn\u2019t know what we were going through-other people\u2019s joy triggered my own grief and bitterness so bad that it felt like a personal attack from the universe. \n\nIt was a dark time for me. I was crying constantly, angry with God, the universe, everything. I started seeing a therapist weekly and things got a little better.\n\nAll of this to say, while I can\u2019t imagine the pain and grief that you\u2019re in specifically, I can empathize and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nI can\u2019t make a judgement here because I know how grief and anger can cast a cloud over everything. It\u2019s hard to remember that a good thing happening to someone else is not a bad thing happening to you. They didn\u2019t get pregnant to spite you. I feel you may have had the same reaction if they announced at 12 weeks instead of 7. \n\nPut some distance in if you need to for your own mental and emotional well-being.

But I don't blame you for the initial lashing to begin with, if anything,  you affirmed that him not telling you was the right decision.

But unfortunately I lean YTA. They didn't purposefully get pregnant just to hurt you, they are not obligated to wait 12 weeks and might have had reasons for the announcement (maybe they didn't, and in that case you are absolutely right that waiting would have been the more sensible thing to do). Not congratulating is one thing and is perfectly acceptable in your situation.

I felt like it was unintentionally cruel to announce it so soon after my babies death, my baby is still laying dead on a slab in a morgue awaiting an autopsy and cremation and they couldn\u2019t even wait for that.\n\nIm sorry t say but this is in your head.  They can choose to announce their pregnancy at whatever point in time.  This is blunt and I apologize but the rest of the world doesnt stop bc of your tragedy and that includes other child births announcements.\n\nI recognize this is a cross that you must bear.

Reddit has some grief and loss subs where you can shout your pain into the internet void. I did with a girl who lost her mom when my dad died. \n\nAnd please keep in touch with medical professionals regarding your emotional state because post natal depression could coexist on top of the grief of your loss. Post natal depression is a matter of body chemistry and the effects of hormonal fluctuations on the brain.  It has to be diagnosed by a professional so it can be treated.  I have experienced it.  I unfortunately can\u2019t tell you how to distinguish it from the grief of your loss, which is why I urge you to get a dialogue going with your doctors about your psychological state. \n\nYou\u2019re going to need time to get through this raw pain.

You take your time to grieve and honor your baby.  \n\nYou may wish to pass along through your mom any positive wishes you have for him, his wife and her pregnancy, as soon as you can possibly bring yourself to say anything at all on the subject.   I can understand your grief is too fresh to speak directly to them.  But I think it\u2019s something you should do because NOTHING is certain, and if anything should happen to them, it would compound your grief and your entire family\u2019s pain to have the last exchange between you and them to be something harsh.

And the first person I would tell would be my sibling through a carefully handwritten note that came with tissues and chocolate, because *I would feel guilty as hell that I was doing something successfully that had just caused my sibling so much pain*. We can tell OP that the world isn\u2019t fair, that it doesn\u2019t revolve around her all you want, but frankly, everyone here, in OP\u2019s life, is showing them far less than the standard of empathy or sympathy  I would give to a stranger in this situation, *let alone my sibling*. \n\nOP, I am so so sorry for your loss. Do I think the text you sent your brother was extreme and meant to be hurtful? Yes. Was the way you found out about his pregnancy hurtful? Yes. When you\u2019re ready, I would reach out to him and express that you are as happy for your brother and his wife as someone grieving the excruciating loss you have can be. Your text was *not because they are pregnant* but because of *how and when they chose to share that news*. You are disappointed that it couldn\u2019t wait until after your child\u2019s *funeral*. His child is going to get a celebration of it\u2019s life every year with caje and presents and music. From the way people have acted since your baby\u2019s death, it looks like you doubt anyone other than you and your spouse will gather to remember, love, and grieve the life your baby never got to have, after the initial funeral; which I think is the heart of what has you so turned up inside about this. They are taking away from the little time your baby has to be the focus of *anything ever* when the baby they announced is going to be doted on and the focus of everyone\u2019s attention for years to come. My suggestion would be to bullet point *all* your thoughts and feelings about all this, and use that list to try and write your brother a coherent letter expressing *exactly* how you feel, why, how you might\u2019ve treated him if the roles were reversed, and how that while you\u2019re not sorry for how you feel, you are apologetic that rather than sitting on how you feel and taking time to articulate it, you chose to lash out. \n\nTake care of yourself OP. This loss is understandably devastating for you and I cannot even begin to imagine the hurt you feel. It\u2019s not fair that this kind of thing even exists. It\u2019s on the same shelf as children with cancer. *It\u2019s just not right*, but it is, unfortunately, our reality.

Why? Because it would make them assholes!\n\nI also think that their \"religiousness\" kinda makes it worse because of the belief many very religious people have in \"God's Will\". If they're very religious, they may not even see this as the terrible loss that it is and instead as something that had to happen, or a learning lesson or at worst, some divine punishment for \"sin\". OP says \"partner\" after all and not husband so it makes me wonder if that's a factor.\n\nI think announcing a pregnancy to a sibling two weeks after they lose a baby is heartless and cruel especially when there was little risk of showing at that point.

There were 3 other people who I knew battling at the same time as me. One was extremely over the top on social media.  Never about her amazing husband and son just her trying to get to meet Pink or trying to get on a talk show. Each to their own. I made hard choices and it wasn't fun, but I survived! The other gal didn't want anything to do with me as I got good reports. Our last conversation she said, \"I want to be happy for you but I can't.  I need to be around my people\" When I asked for clarification and expressed my belief in her, she responded with \"i know this sounds rude, but why do you get to do well and I'm still dealing with this? Maybe later we can reconnect, but I just don't want to be around others who are winning when I'm losing\".\n\nI was shocked, but said I understood although I didn't.  Why would she want me to suffer because she was? Sadly, out of the 4 of us, she is the only one who has passed. \n\nPlease find strength in your loved ones' life moments.  I promise you that you will find peace and healing in that more than you know!", "I don't want to be cruel to you at this time but I feel like it was intentional so you didn't find out any other way. I think they were trying to save your feelings here and that's why your mum told you because they're obviously happy and feel bad for you right now so wanted a gentle announcement just for you rather than their delighted faces telling you or through the grapevine gossip.", "NTA \n\nSorry for your loss.\n\n>she defended my brother and his wife and said it wouldn\u2019t of mattered when he shared his news.\n\nYes it does. Your baby is in the morgue. A few weeks out you would have had more time to process your grief.\n\n>**My Mother broke the news to me because they didn\u2019t want to be the ones to tell me.**\n\nA lot of people seemed to miss this part and let your brother off the hook saying he didn\u2019t share the news with you so not his fault on timing. This clearly negates that.\n\nThere is a reason folks know it\u2019s hurtful to the parents to announce a pregnancy at the funeral of a deceased child. You haven\u2019t had a funeral yet or even a private goodbye to your child. \n\nNo, the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you but it\u2019s still unkind to not wait a few weeks when this is your brother and his wife. Not friends. Not just somebody you know.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but YTA. Not everyone\u2019s world revolves around you. Your situation truly sucks, it really does. People continue their lives.", "YTA. The world's goes on.

To not lash out? To not feel some type of way that she just lost her firstborn child, and then before she\u2019s even had time to try and cope with the grief she hears that news?\n\nTrauma can make us irrational. Grief can take over and turn us into people we don\u2019t recognize. Sadness morphs into anger and we do things that are completely out of character. But worst of all, the weight of loss can be unbearable, suffocating, and torturous - especially when it\u2019s fresh. \n\nI\u2019m sure her brother will recover from her angry text message a lot easier than she will recover from this loss. And I am sure if he\u2019s any type of decent parent and/or supportive partner to his own wife, he realizes that her response has everything to do with her own trauma and nothing to do with their pregnancy. In time, things will get better. But right now? Everyone needs to have compassion and be supportive, on both sides.\n\nCut the woman some slack, goddamn.", "r/IAmTheMainCharacter\n\nCan't blame you for this since your body chemistry must be in shambles, hence the surge you felt, but other people still have lives too. Seems like you already realized you should isolate to heal, wish you good.", "Summed it up perfectly. I remember when I was going through my loss someone said to me \u201cyour world has stopped turning and it\u2019s going to be strange and sad to watch as everyone else keeps going on with their day to day life\u201d. That stuck with me and did help me try to move through my grief myself and not lash out at others. \n\nSure it\u2019s hard to see social media posts and baby bumps, messages from friends about their kids. But that\u2019s all a me thing.", ">When I was grieving, it felt strange seeing people doing their thing, smiling, laughing, celebrating, enjoying the weather...because my own world had turned black. There was this weird contrast between the hell I felt internally and the sheer normalcy around me.\n\nI've never managed to explain it as well as this. When my nan died, I stepped out of the hospital and expected the world to be stood still. There were ambulances pulling in, people walking around and chatting and it blew my mind. It was my first time losing someone very close to me and I was in such shock I threw up.", "I had a termination for medical reasons at 23 weeks, so I completely relate to struggling with my grief while surrounded by happy, smiling people.  I actually found comfort by staring at Bruegel\u2019s Landscape with the Fall of Icarus.  I can\u2019t explain why very well, but it did make me feel that I was not alone in what I was experiencing.  When we experience grief, heartache, tragedy, we almost always have to go on with our everyday lives while those feelings are still fresh and raw.  It made me really think about how at any time we are out in the world, there is an Icarus among us, having the worst day of their lives.  I hope it has made me more empathetic, kind, and aware of others.", ">6) Be mad at your mom for telling you not at your brother and SIL for not telling you.\n\nExactly they didn't want her to hear the news they cared about her feelings, the problem was her mother.", "This.

There is such a thing as compassion and empathy.", "Honestly I think the saddest part of this is the bridge she burnt down with her family over this.\n\nI fully empathize with OP, as I'm sure her Brother and SIL did as well, but that nuclear message she sent, they will NEVER forget that. Even if they do forgive her, which I hope they do, there will always be the memory of that vitriolic outburst whenever they think of OP and their own child, and that WILL put a damper on any relationship they have going further.\n\nI know this sub likes to say that your feelings are your feelings and that you are valid for having them, but feelings like that, especially when shown the light of day truly have long lasting consequences.", "They weren\u2019t the ones that told her though! The mom did", "I'm sorry you are going through this. You can send a note apologizing for what you said, explaining not yourself right now and that you will not be in contact for a while while you work through this. \n\nIf you haven't started counseling, do so. It will help with the aftermath of your loss and help you when you do start efforts to conceive. \n\nBe gentle with yourself and show your grace. Sending prayers.", "Well put. Did the Mom leak the news without the brother and SIL knowing? I\u2019m not clear there.

Wait a few weeks at least.", "And uncontrollable maternal hormones!", "I can't believe I had to scroll so far to see a comment like this. Trauma, grief, post-partum hormones and physical recovery... and everyone is saying she's the AH, it's shocking the lack of empathy for OP. Only two weeks after her loss!", "I\u2019m sorry you went through that. Your friend was missing empathy and compassion. I could understand her feeling awkward but\u2026hate? Goodness.  You deserved better.  \n\nSome of the harshest hateful tones some people are taking with OP in her raw grief honestly have me a bit shook.  I\u2019m glad you took the time to extend your empathy despite the pain it must dredge up for you.", "Agreed. OP is not upset they\u2019re expecting. She\u2019s upset at the timing of their announcement. She just lost her child and in a few weeks would be in a different headspace. A close sibling is not a stranger on the street, so wanting some consideration for the timing is not entitled behavior in my book.\n\n>My Mother broke the news to me because they didn\u2019t want to be the ones to tell me.\n\nAlso a lot of commenters seemed to miss this. Brother and SIL gave permission for mom to tell to OP. They had to know this would be difficult for OP to hear right now and didn\u2019t want to tell her themselves. The kinder thing to do is wait for a few weeks for your grieving sister to process her grief, not just have your mom say it for you IMHO!", "Lol the world doesn't stop for OP. Brother is in his right to tell his own family his news. \n\nYou and OPs attitude need a reality check", "While lots of people do wait 12 weeks, plenty of people announce earlier, especially to family. If you\u2019re having a challenging pregnancy, it can be hard to hide the symptoms, if there are future plans eg vacations or family events that you need to rearrange due to the timing of the birth, if you\u2019re struggling and need extra help with your other child, if you\u2019re taking time off work, if you keep going to medical appointments. Having that support early on is really important to some people", "I sincerely hope OP does not read this cruel comment", "I announced at 6 weeks. Most people wait so they can keep a miscarriage secret. The brother didn't even tell OP. She can grieve as long as she needs to but the world doesn't stop for everyone else.", "How would the brother have known when it would have been the right time to announce the pregnancy? I don\u2019t think an \u201cextra 5 weeks\u201d would have made any difference to OP\u2019s sentiments. Grief looks different for everyone and it\u2019s unfair to suggest that the brother should know when the optimal time would have been to share his news. \n\nAt the end of the day, the brother\u2019s primary responsibility is to himself, his pregnant wife and his child. If the brother chose to announce his news at 7 weeks or at 8 months, it\u2019s well within his right to do so. It\u2019s entitled to assume that he should have prioritized his sister over his family by telling his wife to remain silent and keeping her pregnancy a secret from everyone.", "I think it might help if you really look at what you said here.\n\n>I feel like the world will just forget about my sweet baby and because they never breathed they never mattered.\n\nAnd up there in your main post you said: \n\n>I don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t wait to announce their pregnancy til 12 weeks? (As is usually the tradition)\n\nYou understand *why* that is the tradition, yes? Because the vast majority of miscarriages happen before 12 weeks, and \u201ctradition\u201d is for women to keep quiet about them, so they don\u2019t disturb others, and the world can forget about their lost babies.\n\nWe\u2019re moving on from that now. We understand better how traumatising pregnancy loss can be, and how parents can benefit from support during and after losses. Not everyone chooses to disclose pregnancies earlier, but a lot of people do. It\u2019s likely that your brother and SIL chose to tell your mother because they saw what you were going through, and that made them realise that if, gods forbid, they lost this one, they would need your mom\u2019s support just like you do.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that they made the deliberate decision *not* to tell YOU, because they didn\u2019t want to hurt you. It\u2019s less clear why your mom chose to tell you, but that\u2019s nothing to do with your brother and SIL. You owe them an apology for that.\n\nFor the record, you do have my sympathy, even though I think YTA. I lost my last baby eighteen months ago at close to 24 weeks. No real reason, just my body doing what it does. I lost my baby\u2019s father before that - he\u2019s still alive, but has returned to the abusive situation he was in before we got together, and is lost to me until and unless he decides to leave. Since then, I\u2019ve lost my cat and my mom. And before that, I lost my other four pregnancies. Grief is hell. Compound grief is worse. You get to a point where so much is piled on top of you, you use all your energy just trying to keep breathing. I *urge* you to seek professional help with this.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "Hey, severe depression does make you lose perspective. You can\u2019t see anyone or anything else because it feels like your pain is all there is and never ending. It makes sense that you feel that some breathing room would have allowed you respond in a way that is consistent with how you see yourself, but that may also not be true. When we\u2019re in pain, we often lose our self-awareness. \n\nLife will keep moving and you will keep moving, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the love you had for your child. You cannot get stuck in this place in time. I recommend therapy, not only for the loss of your baby but to process the feelings you\u2019re having around struggling to conceive. \n\nI have a coworker who always wanted a massive gaggle of children, but she struggled immensely to conceive. She has had several miscarriages and a stillbirth, but still ended up with two lovely daughters. Unfortunately, she has made her losses her world. Even almost ten years later, after her stillbirth, she bemoans not being able to have the family she wanted. Around the anniversary of the stillbirth, she can\u2019t even look at her daughters, because just drowns herself in self pity. As you might guess, the daughters have severe anxiety problems. \n\nI say all that to say this: depression can make us selfish. Make sure you give yourself what you need to get out of this time intact. Be vulnerable, apologize, have long talks, allow yourself to be held and loved. That way, when you are blessed with a child, from your womb or through adoption (if that\u2019s something you\u2019d want), you\u2019re ready and able to give them the love they deserve.", "This is very tragic. Please seek someone to talk to. It helps.", "That is definitely an understandable feeling that I can relate to on a degree (I haven't been nearly through the pain that you have, but I have felt that feeling before) - still, you can't lash out at your brother. It's not his fault.", "I'm so sorry. I lost 4 pregnancy. I know how angry and sad it can be. My youngest brother also got his wife pregnant while I was struggling. He already had a child that he doesn't see or take care of in any way. All of my rage focused on him. It's so hard not to find a focus for your anger when you go through something like this where there's nothing you can blame for the loss. It wasn't right to be angry at another person's good luck. I know its hard and you will never forget your beautiful baby, but you need find a healthy focus for your anger either physical or mental. For me it was a punching bag and books. I also recommend every now and again when feeling are really high a rage scream into a pillow. Again I am so sorry. You're not alone and your little one will not be forgotten.", "I am so deeply sorry for your loss.

I told my sister i love her but will not be involved for my own health. It is ok to take a step back from them if you need to.

While it is true your mother told you and not your brother, I do believe that no matter when you heard the news it would have been hard for you.  While your text to your brother was harsh, it was not completely inappropriate.  They could have waited to tell ANYONE, they knew and that's all that needed to know at the immediate time.  Waiting would have been a caring thing to do on their part.  I also feel that saying 'The world doesn't revolve around you'  was completely inappropriate.  While it may be true, right now during your difficult time is not the time to be so uncaring and rude.  I'm saying NTA, but please reconnect with your brother once things have calmed down a bit. \n\nYour baby did matter, you have suffered a great loss.
