Soft just because of your loss. \n\n1)They didn\u2019t tell you. Your mother did. They respected your loss and suffering. \n\n\n2) They might have announced it early because someone heard about it or your SIL is too sick to hide it \u2026 and they didn\u2019t want your mum (or someone else) to learn the good news from strangers (hello social medias!). \n\nThey are also free to announce when they want. There is no 12 weeks law. It is just something SOME people do, SOMETIMES. \n\n3) the world doesn\u2019t resolve around you. They cannot stop to live because of your loss. \n\n\n4) your text was very inappropriate. They didn\u2019t tell you. They protected you. Not their fault if your mom told you.\n\n5) based of your behavior even if they have waited until the birth to announce their new baby you would have been angry because it\u2019s all about you, you, you!\n\n\n6) Be mad at your mom for telling you not at your brother and SIL for not telling you.\n\n\n7) Wait a few weeks and send a text saying you\u2019re sorry for your last message and if you feel better, congratulate them. \nDon\u2019t be too hopeful for a quick answer you might have hurt them deeply with your cruel words.", "YTA.\nThey didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did. Why are you not accusing her of stirring the pot? \nAnd honestly, given how angry you are right now, would a few weeks have really made a difference? Would you really have been okay with the news? \nThe fact they haven\u2019t responded yet also speaks volumes to me. They know you\u2019re upset. They didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did. And that\u2019s also probably why she\u2019s defending them. She knows she messed up telling you the news, and sees you\u2019re taking it out on the wrong person.", "YTA. \n\nYou used your own pain to colour your interpretation of events and you turned your pain against them in a most vicious way. \n\nAll you had to say was, congratulations. One word. That\u2019s all it would have taken. You didn\u2019t even have to mean it but it was the mature and polite thing to do. \n\nInstead you have upset everyone in the family. The family who went out of their way to tell you of the news in the least upsetting way for you. \n\nYour situation was extremely distressing and I have huge amounts of sympathy for you but to do what you did was an asshole move of the highest order.\n\nYou now have some serious apologies to make. Don\u2019t make them until your head is straight.", "YTA. \n\nI was all set to vote N A H, until I read how you sent him that nasty text message.  I understand that you are hurting terribly, but you are punishing your brother for no reason.  He didn\u2019t do anything wrong.  He didn\u2019t announce his good news (and it IS good news, even if you don\u2019t want to hear it right now) to hurt you.  Honestly, a couple weeks would not have made any difference to how you felt about the news.   \n\nYou are grieving for your loss and I believe that is what made you react in the way you did, but that does not excuse your behavior. \n\nI am very sorry about your loss and hope that you recover soon to a point where you are able to function somewhat normally.  I know that you will never recover completely from this.", "I'm sorry for your loss. Your reaction, however, makes you an AH. The world doesn't stop for us and our tragedies. How is it being cruel to announce a pregnancy just because someone else is no longer pregnant? \n\nPregnancy isn't a zero sum game.", "yta\n\ni was very sympathetic to your story \n\nuntill the end where you sent them a abusive message \n\nI felt so betrayed and angry that I sent him a text message calling him and his wife cruel assholes and said he had to of known what his news would of made me feel and if the shoe was on the other foot that I would of kept my news for a few weeks longer, they could of at the very least waited until the next month.

Yes, they could have waited a while but you ending a relationship with your brother and his wife for not announcing their pregnancy on a schedule that YOU would have found acceptable is over the top.", "YTA. Yes because people can totally plan when they get pregnant \ud83d\ude44 also, there is no \u201crule\u201d about when you announce you\u2019re pregnant.", "I understand your loss and the difficulties TTC. I really and truly do. \n\nHowever, you messaging them to call them cruel assholes was 100% uncalled for. I understand you are hurting and grieving, but they did nothing wrong. Tradition is not law, and you were told in a manner to allow you to deal with your emotions without an audience.\n\nThey don't have to wait to announce their pregnancy, and honestly a couple of weeks wouldn't have made any difference because it would still be soon after your loss. There is no way for them to handle this that wouldn't have hurt you.\n\nSo even though I am really sympathetic to your loss, I am going to vote YTA.", "Gentle YTA. I'm so very sorry for your loss. Be kind to yourself, but I think you will regret how harsh you were. If you two have been this close, is this really how you want the relationship to end?\n\nI agree that it would have been better for them to wait, but I'm not sure the news would have been any easier on you a month from now. It was always going to hurt, a lot. Sharing it while you weren't present shows some consideration for your feelings, so I think they were probably trying to do what they thought would be easier on you even if they messed up.", "You're feelings are valid....I am so sorry for your loss. It doesn't excuse your behavior tho. \n\nYes....it would've been nice of they waited tilv12 weeks but your mother is correct....today or 5 weeks from now you still would've been upset. And most people could care less about tradition now. It all would've still been too soon. But they can't put their life on hold. \n\nAnd you said how close you and your brother are. I doubt he is being cruel.  Honestly....they may be thinking they are adding a lil sunshine to the family's sorrow.", "So sorry for your loss, but please don't turn your hurt onto your brother and his wife. You mother is right: it really wouldn't matter when he shared his news. It's heartbreaking for you either way. Take care.", "NAH. You're grieving and it was kind of a harsh move to announce their pregnancy right after what you've been through, but you can't be mad with them not waiting 12 weeks.", "YTA.  Geez.  It is one thing to not congratulate them but it is beyond an AH move to text them and calling them cruel AH. You are beyond an AH. \n\nI hope your brother and wife cut you off permanently even if at some point in time you come to your senses on how ridiculous your action were.", "oh god, definitely NTA. I wonder if this was the extended family wanting to \"move on\" to a different baby, which is such an incredibly fucked up mindset to have. Like, do they not understand that things hurt less given more time? \nI kinda agree that this was always going to be painful for you, but it could have been *less* painful.\n\nIf they had announced 5 weeks later, I would have said N A H, but the fact that they announced earlier than normal and the fact that your mother thinks she has any fucking right to tell you how you can and cannot feel when you are recovering from an extremely traumatic event makes them AH's.\n\nSidenote: The trend of religious people having no understanding of trauma (especially other people's) is so frustrating. IMO any god who would allow you to go through what you went through isn't worth praying to.", "NTA NTA NTA: I\u2019m incredibly sorry for your loss. I\u2019m actually surprised there\u2019s so many Y  T  As here.\n\nWhile your reaction may seem extreme towards your brother, what you\u2019ve been through *is* extreme. Infertility, almost IVF, falling pregnant, needing to terminate and giving birth. And your brother couldn\u2019t wait for the cremation before sharing his pregnancy news?! It\u2019s cruel.\n\nWithout reading too much into your sibling relationship, I think you need a break from him, especially since you\u2019ll be watching his wife\u2019s pregnancy.\n\nAgain, sorry for your loss.", "This seems like an unpopular opinion but NTA. I completely understand that what OP texted was very hurtful to her brother and his wife. But in my opinion\u2026 the hurt the text would cause them is not comparable to the pain she\u2019s experiencing by going through a stillbirth. People often say terrible things when they\u2019re suffering. Does that make it ok? Of course not. Does that mean the victim of their words aren\u2019t allowed to be hurt? Of course not. But I think that unless OP has always been a \u201cself centered\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d person, then it\u2019s very clear this text was only a response to her horrific suffering right now. If I were in her brother or SIL\u2019s shoes I would be very hurt, I would probably put some distance throughout the pregnancy, but then ultimately I will try to reconcile. At the end of the day, *someone* needs to take the higher road, and despite the fact that OP is the one who technically did something wrong, I think the disparity between her suffering and the way her brother and SIL will suffer from these texts means that it is her brother and SIL who should have more empathy once they are ready to communicate with OP again.", "I think your reaction is completely understandable, even though it may be a little bit over the top. Even though I\u2019m a 18yo guy and don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be pregnant, I think that what your brother and sister in law did was unnecessarily cruel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If relationships were built with only logic or righteousness there wouldn't be words like 'compassionate' ,'empathy'. Even if the brother didn't realise why can't the mother understand?

Maybe they were telling mum to make her aware that they wanted to tell OP, but needed advice? Maybe they had to because SIL is incredibly sick and they wanted family help to hide it just a little bit longer? I don\u2019t know.\n\nI can\u2019t tell a woman who lost her child she\u2019s an asshole for grieving, I just can\u2019t. 3 weeks ago, she lost her entire world after just finally getting to say hello. Do I think her reaction was wrong to her SIL and brother? Yes. But I also get being so stuck in grief that nothing can make you keep going. Not the sun, not the air you breath, not any relationship you held before it.\n\nNo one should have to bury their child. It\u2019s a horrific thing that will influence the rest of OP\u2019s life.
