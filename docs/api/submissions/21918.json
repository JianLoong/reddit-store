There is no 12 weeks law. It is just something SOME people do, SOMETIMES. \n\n3) the world doesn\u2019t resolve around you. They cannot stop to live because of your loss. \n\n\n4) your text was very inappropriate. They didn\u2019t tell you. They protected you. Not their fault if your mom told you.\n\n5) based of your behavior even if they have waited until the birth to announce their new baby you would have been angry because it\u2019s all about you, you, you!\n\n\n6) Be mad at your mom for telling you not at your brother and SIL for not telling you.\n\n\n7) Wait a few weeks and send a text saying you\u2019re sorry for your last message and if you feel better, congratulate them. \nDon\u2019t be too hopeful for a quick answer you might have hurt them deeply with your cruel words.", "YTA.\nThey didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did. Why are you not accusing her of stirring the pot? \nAnd honestly, given how angry you are right now, would a few weeks have really made a difference? Would you really have been okay with the news? \nThe fact they haven\u2019t responded yet also speaks volumes to me. They know you\u2019re upset. They didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did. And that\u2019s also probably why she\u2019s defending them. She knows she messed up telling you the news, and sees you\u2019re taking it out on the wrong person.", "YTA. \n\nYou used your own pain to colour your interpretation of events and you turned your pain against them in a most vicious way. \n\nAll you had to say was, congratulations. One word. That\u2019s all it would have taken. You didn\u2019t even have to mean it but it was the mature and polite thing to do. \n\nInstead you have upset everyone in the family.

Yes, they could have waited a while but you ending a relationship with your brother and his wife for not announcing their pregnancy on a schedule that YOU would have found acceptable is over the top.", "YTA. Yes because people can totally plan when they get pregnant \ud83d\ude44 also, there is no \u201crule\u201d about when you announce you\u2019re pregnant.", "I understand your loss and the difficulties TTC. I really and truly do. \n\nHowever, you messaging them to call them cruel assholes was 100% uncalled for. I understand you are hurting and grieving, but they did nothing wrong. Tradition is not law, and you were told in a manner to allow you to deal with your emotions without an audience.\n\nThey don't have to wait to announce their pregnancy, and honestly a couple of weeks wouldn't have made any difference because it would still be soon after your loss. There is no way for them to handle this that wouldn't have hurt you.\n\nSo even though I am really sympathetic to your loss, I am going to vote YTA.", "Gentle YTA. I'm so very sorry for your loss. Be kind to yourself, but I think you will regret how harsh you were. If you two have been this close, is this really how you want the relationship to end?\n\nI agree that it would have been better for them to wait, but I'm not sure the news would have been any easier on you a month from now. It was always going to hurt, a lot. Sharing it while you weren't present shows some consideration for your feelings, so I think they were probably trying to do what they thought would be easier on you even if they messed up.", "You're feelings are valid....I am so sorry for your loss. It doesn't excuse your behavior tho. \n\nYes....it would've been nice of they waited tilv12 weeks but your mother is correct....today or 5 weeks from now you still would've been upset. And most people could care less about tradition now. It all would've still been too soon. But they can't put their life on hold. \n\nAnd you said how close you and your brother are. I doubt he is being cruel.  Honestly....they may be thinking they are adding a lil sunshine to the family's sorrow.", "So sorry for your loss, but please don't turn your hurt onto your brother and his wife. You mother is right: it really wouldn't matter when he shared his news. It's heartbreaking for you either way. Take care.", "NAH. You're grieving and it was kind of a harsh move to announce their pregnancy right after what you've been through, but you can't be mad with them not waiting 12 weeks.", "YTA.  Geez.  It is one thing to not congratulate them but it is beyond an AH move to text them and calling them cruel AH. You are beyond an AH. \n\nI hope your brother and wife cut you off permanently even if at some point in time you come to your senses on how ridiculous your action were.", "oh god, definitely NTA. I wonder if this was the extended family wanting to \"move on\" to a different baby, which is such an incredibly fucked up mindset to have. Like, do they not understand that things hurt less given more time? \nI kinda agree that this was always going to be painful for you, but it could have been *less* painful.\n\nIf they had announced 5 weeks later, I would have said N A H, but the fact that they announced earlier than normal and the fact that your mother thinks she has any fucking right to tell you how you can and cannot feel when you are recovering from an extremely traumatic event makes them AH's.\n\nSidenote: The trend of religious people having no understanding of trauma (especially other people's) is so frustrating. IMO any god who would allow you to go through what you went through isn't worth praying to.", "NTA NTA NTA: I\u2019m incredibly sorry for your loss. I\u2019m actually surprised there\u2019s so many Y  T  As here.\n\nWhile your reaction may seem extreme towards your brother, what you\u2019ve been through *is* extreme. Infertility, almost IVF, falling pregnant, needing to terminate and giving birth. And your brother couldn\u2019t wait for the cremation before sharing his pregnancy news?! It\u2019s cruel.\n\nWithout reading too much into your sibling relationship, I think you need a break from him, especially since you\u2019ll be watching his wife\u2019s pregnancy.\n\nAgain, sorry for your loss.", "This seems like an unpopular opinion but NTA. I completely understand that what OP texted was very hurtful to her brother and his wife. But in my opinion\u2026 the hurt the text would cause them is not comparable to the pain she\u2019s experiencing by going through a stillbirth. People often say terrible things when they\u2019re suffering. Does that make it ok? Of course not. Does that mean the victim of their words aren\u2019t allowed to be hurt? Of course not. But I think that unless OP has always been a \u201cself centered\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d person, then it\u2019s very clear this text was only a response to her horrific suffering right now. If I were in her brother or SIL\u2019s shoes I would be very hurt, I would probably put some distance throughout the pregnancy, but then ultimately I will try to reconcile. At the end of the day, *someone* needs to take the higher road, and despite the fact that OP is the one who technically did something wrong, I think the disparity between her suffering and the way her brother and SIL will suffer from these texts means that it is her brother and SIL who should have more empathy once they are ready to communicate with OP again.", "I think your reaction is completely understandable, even though it may be a little bit over the top. Even though I\u2019m a 18yo guy and don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be pregnant, I think that what your brother and sister in law did was unnecessarily cruel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did, so you could have time to privately process it rather than hearing it in a group. This gave you the opportunity to think before you lashed out. But you did it anyway. It is so sad that you lost your baby. But this is happy news for your brother and you should have recognized that. The world moves on. Clearly she was already pregnant before you even lost your child and even if not, they are not going to put their family on hold for a year so you can mourn. \n\nSend your brother an apology and congratulations. Then give yourself some space. I get that you are deeply sad but you have no right to lash out at others like that. You just aren\u2019t thinking straight right now.", "When I was grieving, it felt strange seeing people doing their thing, smiling, laughing, celebrating, enjoying the weather...because my own world had turned black. There was this weird contrast between the hell I felt internally and the sheer normalcy around me.\n\nThen I thought...I wonder how many times I've passed a person who was dealing with their own hell while I was obliviously enjoying my life? 1000s of times. Our grief is our own. We don't stop our lives for others, either...all we can do is be sensitive.\n\nGrief can't be shared or we'd all be depressed, all the time. It's just one of those things. I'm very sorry for your loss - loss is hell but try not to push people away...it's easy to become bitter and want to blame others but it doesn't change anything. You won't forget your baby, that's all that matters.", "NAH \n\nJust a really horrible situation overall. I'm sure there is a reason for the announcement being at this time (my sister announced at I think 8 weeks, so not uncommon) and they seemed to do everything in their power to protect you. \n\nWas your response aggressive and unnecessary? Yeah. But you are going through what I'm sure is the hardest time of your life right now, and grief can hit in such weird ways. I remember lashing out at my younger cousin for saying the word 'nan' after my Gran passed away. It can really hit you. \n\nDoes that excuse what you said? Not at all. But I think once you give yourself some time you can mend things. Even a message stating that things are hard right now and to give you some time while you grieve and you can make things right when you are beginning to heal. Something to show them you're sorry while you are still unable to confront the situation.\n\nShit situations and shit reactions don't make you a bad person. It's how you react to what you've done. I'm sure you'll be alright, friend. Make sure you mend things with your brother and SIL, and give yourself some leniency, you're grieving and healing. Slow and steady.", "Kindly, you should not be seeking judgment right now. What you\u2019ve been through is physically, emotionally, and psychologically horrible and your emotions are fully on the surface. \n\nBut you did come here for judgment. So- ESH. You for the text.

If OP always believes that her brother is cruel, it will be impossible for her brother to take the high road. I completely understand OP is not in her right mind now. And that is completely understandable. But at some point she should reassess her actions. Otherwise she will alienate everyone and her depression will be even worse.", "I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nYou're angry. You're furious that this has happened, because how could it? How could it happen to you? Why did it happen? How is it right or fair? That is grief. \n\nYou've taken that anger and aimed it at your brother. You look at him having this child, and you're angry. He already has one. How can he have another when you just lost yours? All you want is one baby, and now he gets to have two, and it isn't fair! It isn't fair that they are experiencing that joy when you are mourning the loss of all your child was to you already, and all they could have been. How is that right or fair? That is grief. \n\nYou can tell me if I'm wrong, but that is what I think is going through your head. Grief is normal, but you cannot allow it to make you irrational and unreasonable. You cannot allow it to make you bitter and angry. Something truly awful has happened, and that pain may ease, but it won't go away, so if you cannot get a handle on this, it will poison all the relationships in your life. You have to learn to manage the pain and eventually find happiness. \n\nYour brother doesn't deserve your anger. It isn't his fault.

I know I experienced postpartum depression as well, which I unfortunately did not treat. Termination is illegal in my state and I wasn\u2019t able to talk about my experience or share it with many people, which made my feelings of grief and depression so much worse than I think it would have been if I could have done it differently.

You don't necessarily need a therapist to help you deal with grief and loss(because you mentioned in another comment that you don't get free therapy and that it's expensive). You just need each other. Go on a week long trip to some remote area with your husband for some alone time and some quiet. I come from a country where therapy is not widespread and it's basically a rich man's treatment or for people who are clinically diagnosed with something.

And then to top it off they were too cowardly to tell you themselves, and got your mum to do it.\n\nYour mum is an AH as well, she should have shut it down immediately, and definitely not told you if those other AHs couldn\u2019t be persuaded to delay their news, and her continued support of them is disgusting.\n\n2 weeks\u2026.. that is barely enough time to understand what happened, forget about actually processing it and dealing with the tremendous amount of emotional and physical trauma you are experiencing, you are likely still wondering if it is just a horrible nightmare that you will wake up from.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think your message went far enough - I would have attacked their god as well, as what god would ever do anything like that.\n\nThe only thing that the people who are telling you that you are an AH have right is that you and your husband need therapy to help you come to terms with it, and try to move forward with your lives.", "INFO\n\nWhat happened to you is *bitterly* unfair. It's diabolically cruel. If they did ask your mother to tell you at 7 weeks, I don't see you being the AH in any way at all. If they didn't and your mother just decided to tell you, then as gently as I can say it, that is AH behaviour and quite frankly, your mother is the AH.\n\nAnd, god, you must have heard this a thousand times, but I'm so very sorry for what happened. You've been through a lot, way too much, so take your time to heal and be kind to your mental and physical states and remember there's no time limit on grief. You were getting out of bed again which is such a huge and important step when all you want is to hide from the world.", "Reddit is so strange NTA you are not suppose to announce until 12 weeks. They decide to tell everyone when you literally just lost your baby at 7 weeks when it is there second?! Now, would it have been any easier to hear, no, it wouldn\u2019t but my god if you were my sister I never would have even considered saying anything so early.", "YTA - the main character syndrom. They didnt even tell you, it was your Mother. If anyone was a soft asshole it would be your Mom maybe. I bet if they waited till 12 weeks or whatever you would react the same.", "I am so, so sorry for what you have been through. Ruling NAH, because your brother wasn't trying to be cruel.", "NTA death of a baby trumps news of another every time\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if because you mention they\u2019re \u2018super religious\u2019 if they\u2019re punishing you for terminating (even tho there was literally no other option) \n\nMaybe your text was a little harsh but still NTA", "NTA, and I'm not sure your brother is either, since it was your mother who told you, which was cruel since it was so close to your own loss.

I'm very sorry for your loss.", "Normally I might say YTA, but post partum is a bitch so NTA.", "YTA in a way but it\u2019s sort of okay cause your grieving but still YTA. They were respectful of your loss and didn\u2019t tell you themselves. No matter when they chose to tell people you\u2019d probably still be mad. Your grief is where your behavior is coming from and it\u2019s not okay. It\u2019s okay to feel but you need to get some help and this is coming from someone who is also experiencing grief and not handling it well. So I feel okay in saying YTA. Cause Im an asshole too. Grief is wild and makes you think and behave in such irrational ways. We are justified in how we feel in that moment but need to come back to reality at some point and see where we were so wrong. They aren\u2019t being selfish in living their life but you\u2019re taking it personal because of your loss. You cannot remove your hurt from their happiness and until you deal with it you won\u2019t ever be happy for them. You need to apologize. You don\u2019t have to wish her well but you need to say sorry for how you behaved. Im sure they\u2019ll be more than understanding since they already thought of you in the beginning. Be kinder to yourself. Confide in people with how you feel. Get a journal. Go seek counseling. Life is still going to move on regardless of the loss we experience. Everyone is still going to push forward while you feel stuck in time. Find a good way to cope. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I hope you take care of yourself.", " YTA. Sorry for your loss that is a tragedy, but being mad at someone else for being pregnant is not the way to go. And that waiting for 12 weeks thing is not a rule, I wait until then to announce publically but I tell my close family members as soon as I find out I\u2019m expecting for a number of reasons. (One reason being that morning sickness is really bad during the first trimester why should a pregnant woman suffer in silence until the second trimester?) also did you ever think that your mom and other members of the family may have been affected by the loss as well, obviously not anywhere near as severely as you, but that was her grandchild as well and people cope a lot of different ways.", "I am so sorry for your loss, but YTA in this situation.

So unless you're very close to (or over) 40, I feel that your level of anxiety and obsession with getting pregnant are extreme and unhealthy for you, and will be unhealthy for any future pregnancy. (Actually, even if you are around 40 it still sounds extreme)\n\nI'm very sorry for what you're going through, I can't even imagine how traumatic a loss under these circumstances can be. But I think you need to first heal mentally and change your mindset before trying again, or you'll risk starting a second pregnancy with even more stress and anxiety than the first one, and that *will* affect the baby.\n\nAs for this particular situation, I'm wondering if maybe your brother and SIL didn't decide to share their news early to bring some happiness to the rest of your family who are grieving your loss? I know to you it felt like a low blow, but also you can't expect them to put their lives on hold while you go through this.", "YTA.  It wouldn't have mattered when they announced the pregnancy,  It's going to be brutal on you.  That's just straight up truth and you have every right to be angry with the world.  You don't have the right to take it out on your brother and his wife.  The way you messaged them was rude and uncalled for.", "YTA but grief can make people irrational. My brother and SIL have struggled to conceive, and when I got unexpectedly pregnant, I was excited but also immediately very sad for them. I didn\u2019t want to tell them. I didn\u2019t want to see the pain on their faces. But I was still entitled to be excited about my baby, while still mourning their losses. She\u2019s two now and honestly, they still hurt sometimes being around her. I made them godparents and they have a special relationship with her, but I know they carry pain and resentment. And that\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t imagine struggling to conceive, losing multiple babies, and then someone you\u2019re close to just becomes pregnant easily. Life is very complicated and hard sometimes. Your brother and his wife deserve to be excited right now. That doesn\u2019t take anything away from what you\u2019ve been through.

It's grief, anger, rage, and hate that is going to put a wedge between you and your loved ones. \n\nPlease find a support group. They can be lanterns in this very dark time.\n\nThe message to your brother was uncalled for. BUT I can see why you sent it.", "Full on AH. YTA. Yes, it absolutely is horrible you lost your baby. ESP in that matter. But expecting others to hide their happiness just to make you feel better? That screams entitled brat to me.", "Soft YTA, I really hope you can talk to a therapist.  Please get some help. Don't deal with this on your own. Please make sure your spouse has some support, too.\n\nTell your mum you are getting help, and plan to apologize to both your brother and SIL. You need to. You know, in your heart,  that you were in the wrong. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. I wish nothing but healing to you.", "I'm sorry but, YTA.  You can't expect people to put their lives on hold bc you're hurting.  It's true, it doesn't matter when they announce it, it's going to hurt.  Not everyone waits the 12 weeks to announce a pregnancy.  There's no rule about that.  Just bc they did it with the first one doesn't mean they have to wait to announce the second one.  As difficult as it's going to be to watch her go through her pregnancy, they have done nothing wrong.", "OP. My heart breaks for you. Life is so cruel and unfair, and you are undergoing the harshest thing a human has to suffer - the loss of a child. And without minimising your grief and sorrow - YTA. \n\nBut I believe it is a YTA without malice, and one brought on by the fog of sadness you are mired in. \n\nI think you yourself will realise as time passes that you acted in haste and allowed your grief to guide your rage. \n\nGently, what you are saying is irrational. 12 weeks is an arbitrary measure that society imposes on women, and guilts them and shames them of outcomes regardless. As your tragic story shows, noone is \"safe\" at any point. Plus this is not \"announcing\". This is merely sharing with your close family members - I had told my parents and my sibling that I was pregnant pretty much by the time the pee was dry on the stick. \n\nSecond pregnancies are harder to hide and if they have a little one at home, they may not want her to spill the beans. \n\nThey also showed so much compassion to your situation and allowed your mother to break the news to you individually. They did not tell you, they did not approach you, they didn't rub it in your face. They are clearly good people. \n\nYour reaction was totally off the handle, but given your grief, and your close relationship with your brother I'm sure they will forgive you. Reach out and apologize. \n\nAnd when you feel like -  share with them, and your family, and even here with us if you would like about your baby. What was their name? I'm sharing something I read - and I hope it gives you comfort - all they knew was love \ud83d\udc96.

I don\u2019t feel they should\u2019ve announced it as you\u2019re going through what you are, especially since your baby hasn\u2019t even had an autopsy yet. But maybe they were trying to bring some light to a dark time in your families life. \n\nI would be just as angry as you though if they had announced it then. But I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve sent the text message - no one can say what they would do in a moment like what you\u2019re experiencing right now. \n\nMaybe send a text to brother and apologize - but tell him you need space from his family during this time. \n\nAgain, I hope you do start feeling better and are able to get some therapy or have someone you can talk to because it\u2019s not fair what happened to you and your feelings are valid.", "Understandable, but YTA. I wouldn't call you TA for not congratulating your brother, but for sure for the mean words and claims of ending the relationship. You definitely owe your brother an apology, but hopefully he understands and won't give you a hard time.", "YTA No wonder your brother didn't want to be the one to tell you. You would have found something to be mad at 12 weeks for, too. Your brother not having problems and living his life is not slapping you in the face.", "Gentle YTA. Your brother didn\u2019t cause what happened to you, nor did he wave his pregnancy in your face to gloat. You\u2019re grieving, and grief can make people irrational. I would apologize to your brother and wife, and then kindly ask them to give you space right now until you\u2019ve had some time to process your own pain.", "YTA, your loss is awful but not anyone else\u2019s issue to work around.\n\nHonestly, if I were then I wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with you right now given your reaction. \n\nThey deserve happiness during their pregnancy even if you had a different experience.\n\nSigned- went through infertility and you are way out of line", "It doesn\u2019t ever seem right to call someone who lost a child an AH but yes, YTA. It seems like they definitely took what precautions they could not to upset you as much as possible. You say you wish they waited 5 more weeks, but honey you lost a child, your grief isn\u2019t going to be any less when they are 12 weeks pregnant or now. For you, there will never be a right time for them to announce, it will hurt you either way. \n\nYou need to understand that for others life does go on. I remember when we took my mom off life support and she passed, I was in the Hall and I watched nurses calmly talk where they wanted to order their lunch from. It was a reminder that while it seems like the world stopped for me, it\u2019s still spinning for everyone else.", "YTA. Your pain is not an excuse to lash out. You would end your relationship with your sibling because their wife is pregnant? That\u2019s awful. \n\nYou have a lot of growing up to do. How are you going to be a good parent if you treat those closest to you like garbage just because you\u2019re grieving?", "YTA, while what happened to you is tragic and you have to grieve in your own time we all know that this was going to be painful no matter when they announced. Your loss doesn\u2019t mean others have to hide their pregnancies or children. To cut your brother off over his wife being pregnant is unreasonable and when your grief settles you will realize that. When you get pregnant again you\u2019ll want people to be happy for you, but that will be difficult for someone else.

You don\u2019t know me, and have no reason to believe me\u2026but I get it. What you\u2019re doing here is taking all that anger and pain that you (rightly) have for the cruelty and unfairness of losing your baby, and have projected it onto two people that haven\u2019t actually done anything wrong.

I'm not familiar with the feeling of loosing a child, but I truly feel your pain and I hope you'll get through this horrible time\n\nThat said, what the actual fuck did I just read in the end? You sent an abusive message to your brother because he dared to say him and his wife are having another baby? I know that you're in grief, I truly get that, but that doesn't give you a pass to be so vile. \n\nYour title is also misleading. Its not that you didn't congratulate him, it's that you sent a horrible message calling him names and breaking your bond. Truly, you need serious help. Also, since they weren't even the ones to tell you, it truly seems like they might have waited but your mom figured she could still tell you. Most likely had hope you wouldn't be so horrible.", "Yta. People trying to get pregnant unsuccessfully go through some crazy brain chemistry that seems to prevent them from being happy for anyone else, which leads to people letting a lot of bad manners and impropriety slide. The fact is that you don't have a right to be nasty to people just because you haven't had a successful pregnancy. It's your personal tragedy, not anyone else's. Other people going through good things is not an attack against you.", "Yup, YTA, a bit. This is a big moment for them and you want them to walk on eggshells for you by calculating just precisely the timing they use to let the world know of their wonderful moment. If you worked in an office and one of your associates got the promotion you wanted, I am guessing you would not congratulate them and think even their achievement should not be celebrated near you. I'm sorry to say, the world doesn't revolve around you and however sad your setback is, that is a happy moment for someone else. If you're that sensitive, then good luck in life. It's not just about you.", "Light YTA\n\nSometimes pregnancies are announced as soon as the couple find out they're pregnant. I'm so sorry for your loss. It sucks and while you want the world to just stop, it won't. Life doesn't stop and you can't control when someone shares their news. They know you're hurting, so they made sure you weren't there when they broke the news. \n\nDo you think you would have felt any better even if they had waited a few weeks? Few months even? You went through a horrible loss.

And that grief will never really go away. But the world around you carries on. You will see people pregnant and people giving birth to healthy babies and it will hit you hard. Life isn\u2019t fair. But it\u2019s also not fair to expect the rest of the world to stop just because yours has. \n\nYour brother didn\u2019t want to tell you. But he is allowed to be excited for his own happy time and to want to share it with the people he cares about. There\u2019s no rule about when to announce a pregnancy and it could even be that they\u2019ve watched your suffering and wanted to bring their own support system into the loop a little earlier so that they know they have people who love them around them. Having a baby is a scary time, even if everything goes perfectly. But if it doesn\u2019t, having people around you to support you is exactly what you need. Don\u2019t deny them that just because you\u2019re hurting. \nAllow yourself time to grieve and for your body to heal.

I understand the simultaneous noisy and silent mound of racing thoughts.\n\n**Your feelings are valid and so are your emotions**, but don't project them on others. If you're feeling overwhelmed by emotions/depression, then find an outlet that's harmless (writing, painting, cooking, exercise, photography, etc.) or even one of those \"smash rooms\" to get it out. Idk if you've tried it yet, but connecting with other women in an anonymous group setting may also help you with being able to talk with others you can relate to on a deeper level who have experienced this.\n\nYou are going to get through this. You are not alone. It just requires time and introspection.", "We lost our first pregnancy very early on. I had so much uncertainty that we would ever be able to conceive due to my PCOS and other factors. So when we found out we were expecting, I was overjoyed. Everything felt like it finally made sense. Then the rug was ripped out from under us.   \n\nMy husband\u2019s side of the family didn\u2019t know what we were going through. 2 months later, BIL and his wife announced they were expecting their second child. I was so, so bitter. Of course they had no idea, and I congratulated them. \n\nI had to unfollow a lot of new moms/expecting couples on Facebook because even though people didn\u2019t know what we were going through-other people\u2019s joy triggered my own grief and bitterness so bad that it felt like a personal attack from the universe. \n\nIt was a dark time for me. I was crying constantly, angry with God, the universe, everything. I started seeing a therapist weekly and things got a little better.\n\nAll of this to say, while I can\u2019t imagine the pain and grief that you\u2019re in specifically, I can empathize and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nI can\u2019t make a judgement here because I know how grief and anger can cast a cloud over everything. It\u2019s hard to remember that a good thing happening to someone else is not a bad thing happening to you. They didn\u2019t get pregnant to spite you. I feel you may have had the same reaction if they announced at 12 weeks instead of 7. \n\nPut some distance in if you need to for your own mental and emotional well-being.

But I don't blame you for the initial lashing to begin with, if anything,  you affirmed that him not telling you was the right decision.

But unfortunately I lean YTA. They didn't purposefully get pregnant just to hurt you, they are not obligated to wait 12 weeks and might have had reasons for the announcement (maybe they didn't, and in that case you are absolutely right that waiting would have been the more sensible thing to do). Not congratulating is one thing and is perfectly acceptable in your situation.

I felt like it was unintentionally cruel to announce it so soon after my babies death, my baby is still laying dead on a slab in a morgue awaiting an autopsy and cremation and they couldn\u2019t even wait for that.\n\nIm sorry t say but this is in your head.  They can choose to announce their pregnancy at whatever point in time.  This is blunt and I apologize but the rest of the world doesnt stop bc of your tragedy and that includes other child births announcements.\n\nI recognize this is a cross that you must bear.

Reddit has some grief and loss subs where you can shout your pain into the internet void. I did with a girl who lost her mom when my dad died. \n\nAnd please keep in touch with medical professionals regarding your emotional state because post natal depression could coexist on top of the grief of your loss. Post natal depression is a matter of body chemistry and the effects of hormonal fluctuations on the brain.  It has to be diagnosed by a professional so it can be treated.  I have experienced it.  I unfortunately can\u2019t tell you how to distinguish it from the grief of your loss, which is why I urge you to get a dialogue going with your doctors about your psychological state. \n\nYou\u2019re going to need time to get through this raw pain. And your baby will always be a presence in your heart.

It\u2019s not fair the world is still revolving and the sun is still shining.  In time, though, you will once again appreciate those facts. But not right now. You take your time to grieve and honor your baby.  \n\nYou may wish to pass along through your mom any positive wishes you have for him, his wife and her pregnancy, as soon as you can possibly bring yourself to say anything at all on the subject.   I can understand your grief is too fresh to speak directly to them.  But I think it\u2019s something you should do because NOTHING is certain, and if anything should happen to them, it would compound your grief and your entire family\u2019s pain to have the last exchange between you and them to be something harsh.

People really are just that clumsy sometimes.  \n\nI wish you and your partner peace and healing.", "I'm not going to make a judgement, I don't think you deserve to be judged.\n\nBut I wanted to send you my heartfelt sympathy, and encourage you to seek help.

If my sibling was forced to give birth to a stillborn, and that poor baby still hadn\u2019t had it\u2019s funeral I wouldn\u2019t be announcing my pregnancy until after that. And the first person I would tell would be my sibling through a carefully handwritten note that came with tissues and chocolate, because *I would feel guilty as hell that I was doing something successfully that had just caused my sibling so much pain*. We can tell OP that the world isn\u2019t fair, that it doesn\u2019t revolve around her all you want, but frankly, everyone here, in OP\u2019s life, is showing them far less than the standard of empathy or sympathy  I would give to a stranger in this situation, *let alone my sibling*. \n\nOP, I am so so sorry for your loss. Do I think the text you sent your brother was extreme and meant to be hurtful? Yes. Was the way you found out about his pregnancy hurtful? Yes. When you\u2019re ready, I would reach out to him and express that you are as happy for your brother and his wife as someone grieving the excruciating loss you have can be. Your text was *not because they are pregnant* but because of *how and when they chose to share that news*. You are disappointed that it couldn\u2019t wait until after your child\u2019s *funeral*. His child is going to get a celebration of it\u2019s life every year with caje and presents and music. From the way people have acted since your baby\u2019s death, it looks like you doubt anyone other than you and your spouse will gather to remember, love, and grieve the life your baby never got to have, after the initial funeral; which I think is the heart of what has you so turned up inside about this. They are taking away from the little time your baby has to be the focus of *anything ever* when the baby they announced is going to be doted on and the focus of everyone\u2019s attention for years to come. My suggestion would be to bullet point *all* your thoughts and feelings about all this, and use that list to try and write your brother a coherent letter expressing *exactly* how you feel, why, how you might\u2019ve treated him if the roles were reversed, and how that while you\u2019re not sorry for how you feel, you are apologetic that rather than sitting on how you feel and taking time to articulate it, you chose to lash out. \n\nTake care of yourself OP. This loss is understandably devastating for you and I cannot even begin to imagine the hurt you feel. It\u2019s not fair that this kind of thing even exists. It\u2019s on the same shelf as children with cancer. *It\u2019s just not right*, but it is, unfortunately, our reality.

You mention that you are close to him. \n\nI think, when you're ready, you should talk to him. Just a conversation about the struggles and how you felt.

Why? Because it would make them assholes!\n\nI also think that their \"religiousness\" kinda makes it worse because of the belief many very religious people have in \"God's Will\". If they're very religious, they may not even see this as the terrible loss that it is and instead as something that had to happen, or a learning lesson or at worst, some divine punishment for \"sin\". OP says \"partner\" after all and not husband so it makes me wonder if that's a factor.\n\nI think announcing a pregnancy to a sibling two weeks after they lose a baby is heartless and cruel especially when there was little risk of showing at that point.

All I cared about was living for my young children and making it as \"fun\" as we possibly could. Honestly,  some of my favorite humorous stories come from that time. There were 3 other people who I knew battling at the same time as me. One was extremely over the top on social media.  Never about her amazing husband and son just her trying to get to meet Pink or trying to get on a talk show. Each to their own. I made hard choices and it wasn't fun, but I survived! The other gal didn't want anything to do with me as I got good reports. Our last conversation she said, \"I want to be happy for you but I can't.  I need to be around my people\" When I asked for clarification and expressed my belief in her, she responded with \"i know this sounds rude, but why do you get to do well and I'm still dealing with this? Maybe later we can reconnect, but I just don't want to be around others who are winning when I'm losing\".\n\nI was shocked, but said I understood although I didn't.  Why would she want me to suffer because she was? Sadly, out of the 4 of us, she is the only one who has passed. \n\nPlease find strength in your loved ones' life moments.

To not lash out? To not feel some type of way that she just lost her firstborn child, and then before she\u2019s even had time to try and cope with the grief she hears that news?\n\nTrauma can make us irrational. Grief can take over and turn us into people we don\u2019t recognize. Sadness morphs into anger and we do things that are completely out of character.

Grief looks different for everyone and it\u2019s unfair to suggest that the brother should know when the optimal time would have been to share his news. \n\nAt the end of the day, the brother\u2019s primary responsibility is to himself, his pregnant wife and his child. If the brother chose to announce his news at 7 weeks or at 8 months, it\u2019s well within his right to do so. It\u2019s entitled to assume that he should have prioritized his sister over his family by telling his wife to remain silent and keeping her pregnancy a secret from everyone.", "I think it might help if you really look at what you said here.\n\n>I feel like the world will just forget about my sweet baby and because they never breathed they never mattered.\n\nAnd up there in your main post you said: \n\n>I don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t wait to announce their pregnancy til 12 weeks? (As is usually the tradition)\n\nYou understand *why* that is the tradition, yes? Because the vast majority of miscarriages happen before 12 weeks, and \u201ctradition\u201d is for women to keep quiet about them, so they don\u2019t disturb others, and the world can forget about their lost babies.\n\nWe\u2019re moving on from that now. We understand better how traumatising pregnancy loss can be, and how parents can benefit from support during and after losses. Not everyone chooses to disclose pregnancies earlier, but a lot of people do. It\u2019s likely that your brother and SIL chose to tell your mother because they saw what you were going through, and that made them realise that if, gods forbid, they lost this one, they would need your mom\u2019s support just like you do.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that they made the deliberate decision *not* to tell YOU, because they didn\u2019t want to hurt you. It\u2019s less clear why your mom chose to tell you, but that\u2019s nothing to do with your brother and SIL. You owe them an apology for that.\n\nFor the record, you do have my sympathy, even though I think YTA. I lost my last baby eighteen months ago at close to 24 weeks. No real reason, just my body doing what it does. I lost my baby\u2019s father before that - he\u2019s still alive, but has returned to the abusive situation he was in before we got together, and is lost to me until and unless he decides to leave. Since then, I\u2019ve lost my cat and my mom. And before that, I lost my other four pregnancies. Grief is hell. Compound grief is worse. You get to a point where so much is piled on top of you, you use all your energy just trying to keep breathing. I *urge* you to seek professional help with this.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "Hey, severe depression does make you lose perspective. You can\u2019t see anyone or anything else because it feels like your pain is all there is and never ending. It makes sense that you feel that some breathing room would have allowed you respond in a way that is consistent with how you see yourself, but that may also not be true. When we\u2019re in pain, we often lose our self-awareness. \n\nLife will keep moving and you will keep moving, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the love you had for your child. You cannot get stuck in this place in time. I recommend therapy, not only for the loss of your baby but to process the feelings you\u2019re having around struggling to conceive. \n\nI have a coworker who always wanted a massive gaggle of children, but she struggled immensely to conceive. She has had several miscarriages and a stillbirth, but still ended up with two lovely daughters. Unfortunately, she has made her losses her world. Even almost ten years later, after her stillbirth, she bemoans not being able to have the family she wanted. Around the anniversary of the stillbirth, she can\u2019t even look at her daughters, because just drowns herself in self pity. As you might guess, the daughters have severe anxiety problems. \n\nI say all that to say this: depression can make us selfish. Make sure you give yourself what you need to get out of this time intact. Be vulnerable, apologize, have long talks, allow yourself to be held and loved. That way, when you are blessed with a child, from your womb or through adoption (if that\u2019s something you\u2019d want), you\u2019re ready and able to give them the love they deserve.", "This is very tragic.

He already had a child that he doesn't see or take care of in any way. All of my rage focused on him. It's so hard not to find a focus for your anger when you go through something like this where there's nothing you can blame for the loss. It wasn't right to be angry at another person's good luck. I know its hard and you will never forget your beautiful baby, but you need find a healthy focus for your anger either physical or mental. For me it was a punching bag and books.

Waiting would have been a caring thing to do on their part.  I also feel that saying 'The world doesn't revolve around you'  was completely inappropriate.

I completely agree with the comments above: it won\u2019t get easier even when they are at 12w. \nAs was told above, they didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did. So maybe your mom doesn\u2019t understand your feelings: blame her, not your brother. Life around you is going forward: you will feel so sad about literally ANYONE being pregnant or having a kid for a long time. It gets easier maybe in 6months from now if you make yourself move forward. I felt depressed for quite some time, but didn\u2019t go for help. My amazingly supportive husband helped me/us to go through the grief, and my bestie helped me to distract a little. I also went all into sport and job. \nYou will feel sad about a stranger you see at the grocery store being pregnant. You will feel bad when someone close to you is pregnant or when you see their kids.

He probably understands your pain as well and that's probably why you don't hear from him either. \n\nHowever. Your pain gives you no reason to not be happy for your brother. It's not like he planned this out. It's not a law or rule. My sister told earlier than 12 weeks now as well.

This is a tough situation because two huge life events with polar opposite emotional impacts are happening:  you're going through a terrible loss and they're experiencing the happiness of new life. This is also something couples  (especially ones who are at the age where it's common for people in a social circle to be starting a family) who are going through infertility go through. They're going through a rough time, while people around them are announcing pregnancies. They don't want to seem like bad friends by not expressing happiness, but it also causes a pang of pain to see other people getting what they want so badly.

You don\u2019t deserve it", "My sister in law announced she was pregnant with her 4th as I was actively miscarrying after becoming pregnant for the first time in my seven year infertility journey. \n\nGirl, I was mad.

For those one really cares about it is sometimes required to if not join them in their celebration, then at least congratulate them & be happy for them, despite being unhappy personally.

You should not allow your misfortune to put a cloud over their happiness", "YTA because of how you handled the situation.

They could\u2019ve announced it at 12 weeks and you would have the same reaction,grief doesn\u2019t disappear in 5 weeks. You\u2019re acting as if they got pregnant to laugh at you because of your situation. \n\nIn 2021 I had a miscarriage,only 3 people know about me being pregnant at that time and the miscarriage. We obviously hadn\u2019t announced it to everyone because we wanted to do something special. One of my best friends announced her pregnancy a couple of weeks after my miscarriage and yes it absolutely broke my heart and I was sad but you know what I did? I sent her a basket with all her favorite things and balloons and wrote her a letter . She then invited me to her baby shower ,which I went, and that was hard for me but this wasn\u2019t my event ,I was there to support my friend and that\u2019s what I was going to do. She has a beautiful boy and I\u2019m his godmother. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m pregnant with twins ,7 months. I was going to wait till 12 weeks to announce it because i was scared but the excitement for the best of me and I ended up announcing it to everyone when I was 8weeks pregnant and I was ready for every possible outcome because at least now I would have more support behind me. I wasn\u2019t relaxed with this pregnancy till I hit the 20 week mark ,now I just sit back and relax but I was a mess,every discomfort I had made me cry because I though of the worst. I have other friends who have experience miscarriages and stillborns in the past year or recently,we just gave them space if they needed,they never lashed out at the ones announcing pregnancies or births. \n\nI understand that grief is hard but it doesn\u2019t justify putting others down for their wins because you lost. How are you going to deal with the birth of this is how you dealt with the announcement? You called them assholes for announcing their pregnancy yet they\u2019ve been supportive of you with everything you\u2019re going through. The least you could\u2019ve done was say \u201ccongrats\u201d and tell them that you\u2019re happy for them but you still need time to grieve. You need to go to therapy or sit down with someone you trust and let all those feelings out , you got to let than anger out . Boxing helps and so does breaking things,go to a Break/Smash room. Take out your anger by yourself not at other people.", "Soft YTA. No one would have been the jerk here, but you sending that text message was far out of line. You are allowed to hurt, but lashing out at people because you view them through pain is not okay.  \n\n\nLoss is difficult and absolutely the way you lost your son is something I wish no one should have to go through. The hardest part about grieving is seeing the world  continues to move around you while it feels like your world has stopped. I don't think it would have mattered whether your brother announced this pregnancy now or later. You would still hurt.  \n\n\nYou have every right to go low-contact or no contact for the sake of your own healing. Your family will need to check in with you occasionally, but also accept when there might be times you need distance. This might mean not meeting the child right away after birth or not attending baby showers, etc. They can't force you to not grieve, but you also can't force them to be apart of your grieving either.", "Very soft YTA. What you sent to your brother wasn't right. You owe him and SIL an apology. An honest one. \"I messed up, what I said wasn't right. Just because I am going through this difficult time, that doesn't excuse my behaviour.\"\n\nIf you are close as you say, there's a good chance at forgiveness. Maybe not right away, but give it time. You are dealing with a serious amount of grief and you're hurting and its not fair and you want other people to hurt more because then they'll take some of your pain away with you. It's a normal, human reaction. \n\nI would highly recommend seeing a professional. They'll give you some tools that you can use to manage your grief. It won't make it go away, only time can do that, but it should make things better.", "You are allowed to feel whatever you feel. You aren\u2019t allowed to try to hurt your brother because you are hurting. YTA. You cannot expect people to ignore their lives because of your grief.

I am also sorry to have to say YTA. You are upset about your child (rightfully so), but you are taking that anger out on the wrong people. It wouldn't have mattered when they announced it - you would have still been upset. You are mad that THEY get a second child, and you just lost yours. You are mad that things are (seemingly) perfect and easy for them, meanwhile you are left with nothing but pain and longing for a child.\n\nIn time, I hope you can see that you took your emotions out on people that didn't deserve it, and I hope you can be happy for the little niece/nephew that will soon enter the family. And I KNOW that one day soon, you will also be bringing your own beautiful baby into the family and would also want that child to be warmly welcomed and loved!", "YTA. Sorry OP, this is classic grief bubble. No one is doing anything to you, I think others have pretty much pointed that out. When the world is collapsing around you from the weight of your grief, realize that the grief changes your perception of reality. You may need to lay low on your interactions and lean into therapy.", "I\u2019m going with a soft YTA.  The thing about grief is that it tends (at its worst point) makes all of us self absorbed.  It\u2019s hard to look outward when it feels as if we are being literally swallowed by this wave of pure anguish. For that we need to be give a degree of grace by those who love us, even though they sometimes suffer the blowback of that grief.\n\nWhat we need to remember that grace given is is also owed, which is often a painful thing to do.\n\nI have no doubt that your brother and his wife meant no harm to you, in fact were quite worried about the impact of their joyful news world have on you.  Sometimes life asks us to rise above ourselves in a way that we fear is unimaginable.  I think this may be one of those times.  \n\nThere is a grief support subreddit here that can be quite helpful.

I wish you healing and happiness.", "I feel so, so bad for you OP. But in this case, YTA.\n\n\"I don't understand why they didn't wait until 12 weeks to announce?\" That's not your decision to understand. I announced my current pregnancy at 7 weeks also, because me and my husband were overjoyed. I also knew that if the worst were to happen, I would have so much support. The 12 weeks thing is an outdated rule, and ridiculous.\n\nI'm really sorry OP, I cannot fathom being in your position. But I think your mother is right here - it wouldn't have mattered when they announced, it would still hurt you.", "I'm sorry for your loss, but your anger at your brother and his wife is misplaced.\nYou don't have to congratulate them, but by your letter, I could tell you were holding a lot of animosity towards them. That is not fair to them.", "YTA, but I understand how grief can turn to anger, which can turn to resentment and make you lash out and hate the people you love the most. You may not see things as they truly are right now. You\u2019re hurting. The universe was very cruel to you. You didn\u2019t deserve it, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through such a horrible experience. Words aren\u2019t enough to even begin to express your pain. But try not to take this out on the people who love you. Take some time and apologize when you feel like it. You may have hurt them deeply, because they love their child too and you said some very mean things to them. They weren\u2019t even the ones who told you about it. Your mom broke the news to you. Probably trying to do it gently so that it wasn\u2019t such a shock to you whenever you find out from others. Take some time to heal.

That being said, this usually only causes my own pain to escalate, especially if it's someone I care about. \n\nIf you and your brother are close, he will understand your pain and not hold it against you. Some situations don't need to have assholes, they just have people going through life. I oftentimes have to remind myself that it isn't always the message that upsets people, just the delivery.

They did not betray you in anyway.  They are not the reason you lost your child.  You are hurting and took it out on them.  Of course you are hurting, but that is not their fault at all.  They do not have to stop their lives for you.   They didn't tell you.  Your mom did and she thought she was helping.  Sometimes it is easier to direct  your anger at other things than deal with the real hurt.   You owe them a massive apology.  You are not in an emotionally healthy place right now, I am sure they understand that.  You cannot blame them for losing your child or the pain you feel.  The thing that helped me the most was a support group/therapy.  They were there for me and they knew exactly how I felt.   Every year they have a remembrance ceremony for all of the lost children.   You have lost a child.  Many hospital's have them or your doctor can direct you to one.   Please take the time to actually feel your loss and go through the pain.  Your hurt and emotions are valid.

If they responded 'yes', then you would be justified in calling them arseholes, though the bit about the relationship being over is, in my opinion, a bit too far even then. If they responded 'no', then they wouldn't be arseholes, but your mother would still be.\n\nWhich is why I'm going with ESH (with the possible exception of your brother and SIL, who may have had nothing to do with you learning about it).", "Sorry but YTA here OP.

I know the pain and emptiness you're feeling. Not only your child, but all your hopes and dreams for them have been cruelly and forever ripped away. And I know how heartbreaking and traumatizing it was to be in that hospital room hearing the cries of all the other babies with their mothers. You are 100% correct in saying there is no way to describe entering a hospital pregnant, but leaving childless.\n\nI lost my little girl 8 years ago, but at moments like this, it still feels like it was yesterday. The pain is always there under the surface. I've simply just made room for it. \n\nPlease be good to yourself. Be good to your husband. Take care of yourself. Find all the support you can.

My SIL announced her pregnancy the second she got a positive pregnancy test two months later, and I still resented the hell out of her. This is way worse. \n\nYes, people have the right to announce their pregnancy when they want. But if you have a close family member (like, idk, maybe a sibling?) who recently lost a child, you should consider using discretion about timing of the announcement. You have to know this will hurt them. Will your life be all that different if you wait a few weeks to announce it? You might not have a choice (and we don\u2019t know for certain that the brother didn\u2019t have a choice), but if you can, that few weeks might make all the difference in the world to the person who lost the child. I know it would have for me. \n\nIn general, I think people need to recognize that pregnancy is becoming more and more of a landmine of an issue. Infertility rates are climbing. Be cognizant of the fact that not everyone might be as overjoyed to hear about your pregnancy the second you know about it yourself. \n\nI can\u2019t call you T A in this situation.

I had just started to get out of bed, when my brother and his wife announced to the whole family that they were pregnant with their second child (only 7 weeks). My Mother broke the news to me because they didn\u2019t want to be the ones to tell me.\n\nI'm going with NTA here. In addition to the emotional trauma of your experiences after two weeks, you are also physically still not recuperated from the birth. 12 weeks is pretty standard to announce. Why did they need to tell the whole family at 7 weeks. If you were my sister, I would 100% have waited to announce. While the news would not be easy to hear at any point, I would have wanted to give you extra time versus when it was still so raw. \n\nI'm so sorry OP. For your loss, and for the compounded stress of this announcement. \n\nAt some point, I hope that you can have a calmer conversation with your brother, and that he recognizes that he messed up here.", "I'm guessing the YTA votes are because of what she texted to her brother about him and his wife.

You don\u2019t get to tell other people that they can\u2019t be happy just because you\u2019re going through a time when you\u2019re not.

Five more weeks wouldn\u2019t have helped. She\u2019s going to be upset with anyone who has a pregnancy or happy moments right now and probably for a very long time. What OP needs right now, is therapy and to show herself love. Even if she needs to cut everyone else off in a time like this to find herself and to cope, that\u2019s fine.

But I think that because you are so deeply hurt, everything/anything hurts.  Like a previous poster said \u201cvery soft YTA\u201d.  As much as you might want to stop the world, it keeps going\u2026again, I am very sorry for your loss", "You are the asshole. You are projecting your own sadness in a huge way. That was not the way to handle the situation at all. The likelihood that your brother announced that to specifically target and hurt you is zero.", "I hate to say this but, YTA but I feel it is grief stricken and not your real feelings. Im so very sorry for your loss, but you can't be mad at your brother for announcing his pregnancy.  unless he rubbed it in your face specifically, I think you need to all agree to forgive, and move on.  Time heals all wounds, and maybe they thought announcing the pregnancy would bring some joy to the family after your loss.", "Very soft YTA only bc of what you sent your brother. However I realize a lot of that was lashing out due to grief. Work on processing that and then you can have a sit down with your brother and SIL. I worked NICU for a long time and have cared for more dying babies than I\u2019d like to remember so while I don\u2019t know your grief, I do recognize it and don\u2019t believe you are a selfish or bad person by any stretch.", "I\u2019ve had a 20 week loss. I also had to give brith to my dead baby. I held her in my arms. We had a funeral and my milk came in the day after that. That said, you can\u2019t be mad at your brother because they want children and are going to tell people about it. They can still love you and express their sorrow while celebrating the life they have made\u2014 they are not you and are living their own life. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Protect your heart. If it hurts to be around them for now, just do what feels best for you. Time does heal.", "You\u2019ve had a lot of responses so I\u2019ll keep it brief- \n\nBut I think the other point worth making here is that so many women and couples have been harmed by the 12-week expectation, because it keeps them quiet about their pregnancy. So many choose not to share yet out of fear of something going wrong, but in the cases where that fear comes true, now nobody else knows to be able to support them through it. So for many couples, telling people early guarantees support if something does go wrong. So I don\u2019t think the not-waiting was done with any malice, they just may need some extra support around this pregnancy (especially after watching someone they love very much go through something so difficult.) \n\nI feel for you and your pain SO much, it is so very real and warranted, and you also deserve all the support in the world. Be gentle with yourself and those around you- these are difficult situations to navigate but if you can all find a way to be there for one another you\u2019ll all be better off.", "YTA.", "YTA, this is purely misdirected anger. When bad things happen and we don't have someone to blame, it can be easy to take it out on the people we love.\n\nYour brother and his wife love you and didn't intentionally let everyone know about their pregnancy just to spite you. Deep down I think you know that. You're going through a very difficult time, so lashing out at others from your pain is forgivable, even if not a healthy way to express your pain. My recommendation is to apologize to your brother and his wife, I'm sure they will understand and try to support you as best they can.", "Soft YTA in only how you handled yourself. They love you and will understand when you are ready to talk to them about it.\n\nIt's going to be a difficult process while you grieve to be around anyone pregnant or with a healthy child. \n\nI'm so very sorry for your loss and hope you can have the supports and therapy in place to process those emotions in a safe environment.", "I\u2019m sorry for what you went through, unfortunately, I know what you\u2019re dealing with. I had 2 late losses last year. I understand your pain. \n\nHowever, soft YTA. They didn\u2019t tell you to hurt you, your Mom told you to protect you. She knew you would hear it sooner rather than later and I presume she wanted to soften the blow. \n\nYour loss is not their fault. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. You say \u201cCongratulations but I can\u2019t talk about it right now. Give me time to heal and I will celebrate with you.\u201d Instead, you called them names and burnt a bridge with someone important in your life. \n\nI highly recommend grief counseling for you. It\u2019s the only thing that got me to stop wanting to carry around the 2 urns I have in my home containing my sons.", "YTA. We are all sorry that you are going through such a tough time. But life goes on for other people and if they felt they were ready to announce it then you cant really be mad at that. Its not their fault you had a miscarriage, these things happen.\n\nYour feelings about your baby matter, he/she existed and lived even if their brain hadnt fully formed, they were a baby and a human being. Just because it wasnt born doesnt mean they werent important or are not meant to be remembered.\n\nJust know, that the baby will never be forgotten because you opened up to us and now at least a few hundred people from different parts of the world will know your lovely baby existed.\n\nGoodluck, and dont lose precious time being mad at your brother, you know how short life can truly be.", "It is not their fault. Yes you went through one of the worse experience possible. However, you are angry about an innocent baby coming into your family. Your brother and family are also grieving for your losses as well as the loss of you. You are lost and hopefully you are able to find your way.", "YTA\n\nI get that you just underwent a huge loss, but that does justify what you did.\n\nWhat's next? Are you going hang around a maternity ward of a hospital and snap at all the pregnant women?\n\nRealize your mistake or grow up to be a bitter woman.", "You\u2019re grieving, and it\u2019s 100% understandable to be hurt by announcements like that.\n\nBUT it does not mean it was done to hurt you. I don\u2019t at all think from what you\u2019ve said that they were cruel. If they had a party, forced you to come, and got pissed when you weren\u2019t happy, that would be cruel.\nBut they didn\u2019t get in your face, your mom told you. And I hope she did so gently, with an air of\u2026so you know.\n\nLife continues for others, even when we\u2019re grieving. You can\u2019t expect them not to be happy for themselves, but they can be happy for themselves and still devastated for you. and thats likely why they had your mom share the news, because they didn\u2019t want you to feel like they were rubbing joy in your face, or give a feeling of  expectation that you should be happy for them.\n\nThey tried to give separation.\n\nYou didn\u2019t just not congratulate them- you berated them.\nYou could have gone without saying anything to them, and that likely would have been understood and accepted. \n\nBut berating then for sharing news in a way that there was no fanfare involved, and when regardless of if they waited a few more weeks, would still likely be painful for you\u2026that makes me say YTA.\n\nSoftly, because, I understand. That\u2019s unimaginable pain, and you lashed out. Understandable, but that doesn\u2019t mean they deserved it.\n\nPlease take care of yourself, though. \nConsider see someone to help you work through your grief. Not to \u201cget over it\u201d, you never get over losing a child, but to process it in a healthier way. \n\nI\u2019m so, so sorry you\u2019ve had to endure this, and you had to face someone else\u2019s baby joy in the face of your own loss so quickly. \nInadequate words- it\u2019s really, really, unfair.  \nBut try to remember it wasn\u2019t done to hurt you- you can still keep your distance until you\u2019re ready not to, but do it if it protects you, vs. Punishes them.", "I don't feel like a judgement on this one, just wanted to say sorry to you OP, I read your story and your baby mattered even if they aren't here. Best wishes for you from an internet stranger.", "Sorry that you lost your baby but your actions will lead to you losing your brother and his family too, without any fault of theirs.", "Imagine getting divorced and then being upset at a couple who invited you to their wedding because you think it's too soon to deal with someone else being happy because your situation didn't turn out like you hoped.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe Y T A is the majority. The pain, grief, loss you are experiencing must be unimaginable. I am so, so sorry for your loss. The way your brother and SIL announced is so insensitive - it is cruel. And they know it is, by the fact they asked your MUM to tell you. They couldn\u2019t even tell your themselves. They could have been kind and waited to 12 weeks before announcing. Giving you another 5 weeks to grieve and process your loss. Strange they did this for the first but not this pregnancy?! They must have know this news would be gut wrenching for you so soon after your loss. Your brother and SIL are assholes.", "Oh wow. Hope you read this NTA.\n\n1. The baby isn't even buried and they (selfishly) just announced the pregnancy to you (was it the mother w/o consent or deliberately timing it from them?)\n2. No need to announce anything to family this early. And even if they were 20 weeks along, they could have waited 4 more out of courtesy (when they were close w/ you and had empathy)\n3. A couple of weeks make hormonal and emotionally a huge difference \n\n\nMy question is really why they were doing this. maybe they planned it right away to announce it at 7 weeks (still they should have changed it regarding the situation). \nI think you have all the right to reevaluate the relationship with them. They hit you with a chair in the face in your darkest moment, and it's ok to stand up for yourself.", "Unpopular opinion: it WAS cruel of your brother and SIL to share that news and were burying your baby. They could have waited a month before dropping that bomb and delivered the message directly to you in a sensitive way.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss and wish you healing.", "Going against the grain here, but as someone who is the sibling of someone with a similar baby loss story, you are NTA. I think you may have jumped the gun with the text message saying you no longer wanted the relationship, but your brother was being an asshole. Also,  your response was not justified, but I feel like people are highly over estimating how controlled they would be in that situation. When you watch a sibling go through that trauma, it is not ok to not be super considerate of their feelings. Life does go on, but if you are close to someone, you are mindful of their feelings. Also, THIS JUST HAPPENED.  If they told your mom and insisted to not tell you,  then they are OK because I get wanting to tell grandparents even if they have to figure out how to navigate a touchy subject.  If they wanted your mother to tell, rather than them have the uncomfortable conversation that is an AH move. If they told her to tell you two weeks after your baby died when they are only 7 weeks, that is just horrible.  My successful pregnancy was well over a year after their loss,  and we still were super mindful about it all.", "NTA at all. These other commenters are taking crazy pills! Them only waiting 2 weeks after your trauma is extremely insensitive. That's way too soon - you're not even *physically* healed yet! There was no reason to not wait a few more weeks, at least until after the funeral. This time should have been about your family focusing on grieving your baby and caring for you, not immediately just getting excited about another baby\n\nHe's an awful \"brother\". Family is supposed to be considerate towards each other. And by asking your mom to tell you, it's clear that he *knew* the news would upset you. It's not like he didn't realize that \n\nI hope your brother owns up to his actions and apologizes\n\nI'm so so sorry for the loss of your beautiful baby", "YTA. First for your deceptive title. You did quite a bit more than just simply \u201cnot congratulating\u201d them. \n\nYour world may have stopped on your miscarriage, but the world didn\u2019t actually stop. Your brother can share news of their pregnancy at whatever timing they see fit (absent it being at someone\u2019s wedding or something).  Although 12 weeks is the custom\u2014mainly for the benefit of the expecting couple\u2014nobody has an entitlement to that. \n\nSo you ended your relationship with your brother over nothing.", "YTA. You got triggered and took it out on them.", "Okay I'm going against the grain here NTA... I think you didn't respond the best with that message to your brother but for one your mother definitely is for telling you the news when she knew you were grieving. Your brother and sister-in-law could be assholes as well. In your post you said that they asked your mother to tell you. If they did that is a huge asshole move.\n\nYou have a right to feel the way you do they also can be happy but waiting a few weeks to make it slightly easier would have been the emotionally correct thing to do. At 7 weeks it means they pretty much just did pregnancy test a week or two.", "YTA while I\u2019m sorry you lost your baby the world does not revolve around you and your grief.", "Unfortunately, I have to say YTA but I\u2019m definitely not screaming it at you. You\u2019re grieving, but it doesn\u2019t give you the right to steal your brother\u2019s joy nor dictate when he and his wife should announce. Sorry for your loss.", "YTA. At the same time, I am sorry you had to go through the trauma of losing a baby.\n\nAt the end of the day, people\u2019s triggers are their own responsibility to manage. They weren\u2019t required to keep their news to themselves to avoid triggering you, and it sounds like they tried to tell you in the least invasive way possible.", "NTA I\u2019m surprised to see so many people calling you the asshole. Under the circumstances, a few additional weeks probably would have made a difference, considering you say that you and your brother are close. You are going through a tough time, and that doesn\u2019t negate that they have (happy) news to share, but he should have been the one to give you the news while also acknowledging that it may be tough for you to receive said news. Everyone saying \u201cwell he didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did\u201d is missing the point - your brother sharing the news with the rest of the family and leaving you out intentionally prob doesn\u2019t feel good either.", "Not even a soft AH, major fucking AH.\n\nGrieving or not, what a fucking way to act and to then cut ties forever? K.", "So well said.", "I also want to add, would anything have been different for you if they waited three more weeks? I mean this gently, but in the face of a seemingly insurmountable heap of trauma and despair, would three weeks have made an ounce of difference given the freshness of your loss?", "Unfortunately I have to agree. What OP went through is very traumatic and horrible and I completely understand their anger/frustration. However, I feel it was way out of line to act in the manner that they did. \n\nThe mom is the one who they should be upset with because SHE told them about the pregnancy, not the brother/his wife. They did what they could to keep the news from OP. I feel like OP should apologize for their behavior toward their brother and his wife.", "I agree. NTA. I can\u2019t believe so many people think she\u2019s in the wrong for her text. She struggled with infertility, lost her baby late term, had to delivery the baby 3 weeks ago, and is likely have post-birth hormonal shifts. I am appalled that her text stands out are more assholey than her brother announcing the pregnancy and her mother telling her. It\u2019s so insensitive.", "I had to scroll way too far for an actual nuanced take.  I can\u2019t believe all the people saying OP is an AH. I don\u2019t think they understood what she had to do.\n\nHer baby wasn\u2019t viable and she needed a termination. At the stage she was at, it wasn\u2019t just that she had to go the hospital and have an ABORTION.\n\nShe had to go to the hospital and LABOUR for however long to give birth to her dead baby. Her and her husband were there in the hospital in the L&D. \n\nShe had to go through labour, being told to push and that she was doing so good. All the stuff you do when you have a baby. But OP and her husband had to do this knowing that there was no happy ending for them. Just more trauma and grief at the end.\n\nThen instead of leaving with her baby, she left with a box of paperwork about the termination/stillbirth. She hasn\u2019t been able to cremate and start the grief process because her baby is still in the morgue. And due to autopsy being needed\u2026 who knows when she will get to bury her baby and start to grieve?\n\nShe states that her and brother are close, he knew exactly what was going on and what she went through. And knowing this he and his wife decided to announce their pregnancy at 7 weeks, only two weeks after OP went through this.\n\nI think her brother and wife are AHs for this. They clearly lack compassion and empathy.\n\nUsually you wait to announce a pregnancy at 12 weeks because it\u2019s a safer time to do so. There\u2019s less risk of miscarriage etc after the first trimester. Unless the SIL also had a history of very difficult pregnancy/carrying to term the compassionate thing to do would be to wait that few extra weeks.\n\nOP I think you are NTA. You said some harsh hurtful things in a difficult situation. You probably could have expressed yourself better but your brother and his wife could have also had some compassion.\n\nTo everyone saying other people\u2019s lives don\u2019t stop because we experience something traumatic. That\u2019s true. But when someone close to us, who we love and care about experiences something traumatic, you should be empathetic and compassionate towards that person. \n\nOr I hope you receive the same treatment when the shoes on the other foot.", "I agree with this completely. The text was inappropriate, but with the combination of grief, trauma, and hormones, labelling OP an AH feels unfair. If anyone is an AH here, it\u2019s the mother. \n\nSeveral years ago, I was struggling with pregnancy-related trauma when someone very close to me became pregnant. She waited until she couldn\u2019t hide it with loose clothing much longer to tell me and I believe all I said was \u201cokay\u201d (my trauma-clouded brain thought I handled it well because I didn\u2019t lash out or have a panic attack). I don\u2019t think I actually felt able to congratulate her until the baby was born. My situation was different than OP\u2019s (SA-related as opposed to a wanted pregnancy) so I\u2019m not sure if this would help or be more painful here, but I crochet and a month or two after finding out, I decided to make her a baby blanket. It was slow and meditative and helped me accept things. I never said it explicitly but I think she understood it also was a bit of an apology for not having been able to be supportive. \n\nYour advice for contacting the brother is spot-on. OP will definitely need some space while healing and it sounds like he and SIL will be understanding. Trying to rush the healing process will only create problems in the long term.", "100% agree that they should have been more mindful of OP. If the wife was showing pregnancy symptoms, they could have just said she was sick or something. Yes, OP should not have insulted her brother and SIL, but I understand the pain she was going through (which anyone here who hasn\u2019t been pregnant can\u2019t even begin to imagine). OP should apologize for insulting, but that doesn\u2019t make the lack of consideration from the brother OK.\n\nShortly after I gave birth, one of my bf had to end her pregnancy as baby had trisomy. She was obviously devasted. I, because I care about her, was super careful on not mentioning baby stuff and even went to see her without my baby a couple of times just to make sure she was OK and to avoid any triggers fo her.

No, but that is what you do for someone you love and care about.", "if anyone is hating mothers its the OP hating her brother's pregnant wife", "I have no idea why you\u2019re being downvoted.", "Exactly, im beyond tired of it.
