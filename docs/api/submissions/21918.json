There is no 12 weeks law. It is just something SOME people do, SOMETIMES. \n\n3) the world doesn\u2019t resolve around you. They cannot stop to live because of your loss. \n\n\n4) your text was very inappropriate. They didn\u2019t tell you. They protected you. Not their fault if your mom told you.\n\n5) based of your behavior even if they have waited until the birth to announce their new baby you would have been angry because it\u2019s all about you, you, you!\n\n\n6) Be mad at your mom for telling you not at your brother and SIL for not telling you.\n\n\n7) Wait a few weeks and send a text saying you\u2019re sorry for your last message and if you feel better, congratulate them. \nDon\u2019t be too hopeful for a quick answer you might have hurt them deeply with your cruel words.", "YTA.\nThey didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did. Why are you not accusing her of stirring the pot? \nAnd honestly, given how angry you are right now, would a few weeks have really made a difference? Would you really have been okay with the news? \nThe fact they haven\u2019t responded yet also speaks volumes to me. They know you\u2019re upset. They didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did. And that\u2019s also probably why she\u2019s defending them. She knows she messed up telling you the news, and sees you\u2019re taking it out on the wrong person.", "YTA. \n\nYou used your own pain to colour your interpretation of events and you turned your pain against them in a most vicious way. \n\nAll you had to say was, congratulations. One word. That\u2019s all it would have taken. You didn\u2019t even have to mean it but it was the mature and polite thing to do. \n\nInstead you have upset everyone in the family.

Yes because people can totally plan when they get pregnant \ud83d\ude44 also, there is no \u201crule\u201d about when you announce you\u2019re pregnant.", "I understand your loss and the difficulties TTC. I really and truly do. \n\nHowever, you messaging them to call them cruel assholes was 100% uncalled for. I understand you are hurting and grieving, but they did nothing wrong. Tradition is not law, and you were told in a manner to allow you to deal with your emotions without an audience.\n\nThey don't have to wait to announce their pregnancy, and honestly a couple of weeks wouldn't have made any difference because it would still be soon after your loss. There is no way for them to handle this that wouldn't have hurt you.\n\nSo even though I am really sympathetic to your loss, I am going to vote YTA.", "Gentle YTA. I'm so very sorry for your loss. Be kind to yourself, but I think you will regret how harsh you were. If you two have been this close, is this really how you want the relationship to end?\n\nI agree that it would have been better for them to wait, but I'm not sure the news would have been any easier on you a month from now. It was always going to hurt, a lot. Sharing it while you weren't present shows some consideration for your feelings, so I think they were probably trying to do what they thought would be easier on you even if they messed up.", "You're feelings are valid....I am so sorry for your loss. It doesn't excuse your behavior tho. \n\nYes....it would've been nice of they waited tilv12 weeks but your mother is correct....today or 5 weeks from now you still would've been upset. And most people could care less about tradition now. It all would've still been too soon. But they can't put their life on hold. \n\nAnd you said how close you and your brother are. I doubt he is being cruel.  Honestly....they may be thinking they are adding a lil sunshine to the family's sorrow.", "So sorry for your loss, but please don't turn your hurt onto your brother and his wife. You mother is right: it really wouldn't matter when he shared his news. It's heartbreaking for you either way. Take care.", "NAH. You're grieving and it was kind of a harsh move to announce their pregnancy right after what you've been through, but you can't be mad with them not waiting 12 weeks.", "YTA.  Geez.  It is one thing to not congratulate them but it is beyond an AH move to text them and calling them cruel AH. You are beyond an AH. \n\nI hope your brother and wife cut you off permanently even if at some point in time you come to your senses on how ridiculous your action were.", "oh god, definitely NTA. I wonder if this was the extended family wanting to \"move on\" to a different baby, which is such an incredibly fucked up mindset to have. Like, do they not understand that things hurt less given more time? \nI kinda agree that this was always going to be painful for you, but it could have been *less* painful.\n\nIf they had announced 5 weeks later, I would have said N A H, but the fact that they announced earlier than normal and the fact that your mother thinks she has any fucking right to tell you how you can and cannot feel when you are recovering from an extremely traumatic event makes them AH's.\n\nSidenote: The trend of religious people having no understanding of trauma (especially other people's) is so frustrating. IMO any god who would allow you to go through what you went through isn't worth praying to.", "NTA NTA NTA: I\u2019m incredibly sorry for your loss. I\u2019m actually surprised there\u2019s so many Y  T  As here.\n\nWhile your reaction may seem extreme towards your brother, what you\u2019ve been through *is* extreme. Infertility, almost IVF, falling pregnant, needing to terminate and giving birth. And your brother couldn\u2019t wait for the cremation before sharing his pregnancy news?! It\u2019s cruel.\n\nWithout reading too much into your sibling relationship, I think you need a break from him, especially since you\u2019ll be watching his wife\u2019s pregnancy.\n\nAgain, sorry for your loss.", "This seems like an unpopular opinion but NTA. I completely understand that what OP texted was very hurtful to her brother and his wife. But in my opinion\u2026 the hurt the text would cause them is not comparable to the pain she\u2019s experiencing by going through a stillbirth. People often say terrible things when they\u2019re suffering. Does that make it ok? Of course not. Does that mean the victim of their words aren\u2019t allowed to be hurt? Of course not. But I think that unless OP has always been a \u201cself centered\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d person, then it\u2019s very clear this text was only a response to her horrific suffering right now. If I were in her brother or SIL\u2019s shoes I would be very hurt, I would probably put some distance throughout the pregnancy, but then ultimately I will try to reconcile. At the end of the day, *someone* needs to take the higher road, and despite the fact that OP is the one who technically did something wrong, I think the disparity between her suffering and the way her brother and SIL will suffer from these texts means that it is her brother and SIL who should have more empathy once they are ready to communicate with OP again.", "I think your reaction is completely understandable, even though it may be a little bit over the top. Even though I\u2019m a 18yo guy and don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be pregnant, I think that what your brother and sister in law did was unnecessarily cruel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did, so you could have time to privately process it rather than hearing it in a group. This gave you the opportunity to think before you lashed out. But you did it anyway. It is so sad that you lost your baby. But this is happy news for your brother and you should have recognized that. The world moves on. Clearly she was already pregnant before you even lost your child and even if not, they are not going to put their family on hold for a year so you can mourn. \n\nSend your brother an apology and congratulations. Then give yourself some space. I get that you are deeply sad but you have no right to lash out at others like that. You just aren\u2019t thinking straight right now.", "When I was grieving, it felt strange seeing people doing their thing, smiling, laughing, celebrating, enjoying the weather...because my own world had turned black. There was this weird contrast between the hell I felt internally and the sheer normalcy around me.\n\nThen I thought...I wonder how many times I've passed a person who was dealing with their own hell while I was obliviously enjoying my life? 1000s of times. Our grief is our own. We don't stop our lives for others, either...all we can do is be sensitive.\n\nGrief can't be shared or we'd all be depressed, all the time. It's just one of those things. I'm very sorry for your loss - loss is hell but try not to push people away...it's easy to become bitter and want to blame others but it doesn't change anything. You won't forget your baby, that's all that matters.", "NAH \n\nJust a really horrible situation overall. I'm sure there is a reason for the announcement being at this time (my sister announced at I think 8 weeks, so not uncommon) and they seemed to do everything in their power to protect you. \n\nWas your response aggressive and unnecessary? Yeah. But you are going through what I'm sure is the hardest time of your life right now, and grief can hit in such weird ways. I remember lashing out at my younger cousin for saying the word 'nan' after my Gran passed away. It can really hit you. \n\nDoes that excuse what you said? Not at all. But I think once you give yourself some time you can mend things. Even a message stating that things are hard right now and to give you some time while you grieve and you can make things right when you are beginning to heal. Something to show them you're sorry while you are still unable to confront the situation.\n\nShit situations and shit reactions don't make you a bad person. It's how you react to what you've done. I'm sure you'll be alright, friend. Make sure you mend things with your brother and SIL, and give yourself some leniency, you're grieving and healing. Slow and steady.", "Kindly, you should not be seeking judgment right now. What you\u2019ve been through is physically, emotionally, and psychologically horrible and your emotions are fully on the surface. \n\nBut you did come here for judgment. So- ESH. You for the text.

If OP always believes that her brother is cruel, it will be impossible for her brother to take the high road. I completely understand OP is not in her right mind now. And that is completely understandable. But at some point she should reassess her actions. Otherwise she will alienate everyone and her depression will be even worse.", "I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nYou're angry. You're furious that this has happened, because how could it? How could it happen to you? Why did it happen? How is it right or fair? That is grief. \n\nYou've taken that anger and aimed it at your brother. You look at him having this child, and you're angry. He already has one. How can he have another when you just lost yours? All you want is one baby, and now he gets to have two, and it isn't fair! It isn't fair that they are experiencing that joy when you are mourning the loss of all your child was to you already, and all they could have been. How is that right or fair? That is grief. \n\nYou can tell me if I'm wrong, but that is what I think is going through your head. Grief is normal, but you cannot allow it to make you irrational and unreasonable. You cannot allow it to make you bitter and angry. Something truly awful has happened, and that pain may ease, but it won't go away, so if you cannot get a handle on this, it will poison all the relationships in your life. You have to learn to manage the pain and eventually find happiness. \n\nYour brother doesn't deserve your anger. It isn't his fault. He did not want to hurt you and went out of his way to try and avoid it. You need to apologise to him for your text. It was uncalled for and unkind. \n\nIf you can't seek therapy, try to find support groups in your area. Also, get support from your doctor for your depression and see if they can help on the therapy front. You can move forward and find some light at the end of this tunnel, as impossible as it sounds right now. But you cannot make other people your punchbag, and you cannot lash out and use grief as an excuse. You need support right now, but you can't and won't get that if you are lashing out at those around you.", "OP I just wanted to say that I\u2019ve been there. I terminated my pregnancy over a year ago at 18w due to severe genetic abnormalities. It was the worst experience of my life for many reasons. Postpartum was terrible for me, both due to the hormones (my milk also came in), and because I didn\u2019t have my child in my arms. Just empty. I know I experienced postpartum depression as well, which I unfortunately did not treat. Termination is illegal in my state and I wasn\u2019t able to talk about my experience or share it with many people, which made my feelings of grief and depression so much worse than I think it would have been if I could have done it differently. I struggle with infertility as well (4 rounds of ivf) and repeated pregnancy loss (7 including my TFMR).\n\nI am sorry for your loss. You don\u2019t forget it, it gets easier with time but the pain is always there. If you can find a support group or at least follow up closely with your OBGYN to screen for postpartum depression, please do. I wish I had. \n\nYou lashed out at your brother because you took their pregnancy news personally. I can empathize with that being painful to hear about. It was still wrong of you though. They didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and weren\u2019t being insensitive to you. I understand why it hurts you, but you have to rationalize that it isn\u2019t about you. This is their joy, and other people are allowed to have that. It would have hurt just as bad at 12 weeks as it does at 7, honestly. You can\u2019t change your feelings but you can keep them to yourself or to an appropriate support person (like your husband), and you can control your actions. I know why you did comes from a place of deep pain, but it was wrong and they didn\u2019t deserve that. \n\nI hope you apologize to him and that they are understanding of your grief so that you can each still be close and support each other right now.", "Grief makes everyone unreasonable, and you are dealing with significant hormonal changes.  I am sorry for what you went through and hope you can repair things with your brother and SIL.", "You can\u2019t afford therapy but you were planning on getting IVF?", "You should also be able to get 6 free sessions through your workplaces (or your partners) employee assistance program.  Please take all the help you can get. The doctor can refer you to more than one therapist too, you just might have to do some leg work to find one. I had to find my own.", "Op try at a psychology school. They might let you have free sessions and supervised students getting credit for those . It would be mutual help.", "NTA.  I was 8 and half months pregnant when we found out my baby was dead. It took 4 days before i actually gave birth. Four days of being on a maternity ward trying all different ways to make the contractions start. The day before I finally delivered my son, a nurse came bursting into my room to proudly announce that a mutual friend had given birth to a beautiful little girl and\" wasn't this just the most amazing news\". I totally lost it on that nurse and threw her out of my room, and my husband, who stayed with me the whole time, also layed into her. This nurse was not allowed near me ever again, and even now, over 30 years afterwards, there is still bitter heart pain when I see her.\n\nWhen people have suffered such an unbelievable loss, they don't need to know straight away that someone has just given birth or are pregnant. They need time to heal. And yes, even a couple of weeks later, it would still have hurt, but maybe you wouldn't have lashed out so much. \n\nSending you a virtual hug from an Internet stranger.", "NTA.

I just didn\u2019t explain all of that in my comment cuz almost everyone else was already saying basically this. I do think that OP will have to recognize her wrongs if the brother takes the higher road, it\u2019s just that I think if someone should take the high road it\u2019s him. I also agree the brother shouldn\u2019t have to completely throw away his feelings for the sake of their relationship if OP continues to think he\u2019s a cruel asshole, and yes she definitely needs to eventually recognize how she went wrong but I think that can only happen if she works through her trauma and heals first, which at the beginning of its process will naturally center her pain instead of the ways she\u2019s hurt others. Like once she\u2019s worked through her own pain, then I think she\u2019ll be ready to and absolutely should take accountability for how she\u2019s hurt others", "Thankyou for understanding. I definitely see your point and I will apologise when I\u2019ve calmed down a little bit. My other brother just had twins and my sister in law and my husbands best friend both just had their baby showers, it feels like it\u2019s coming in from everywhere right now and I guess it was just the last straw for my sanity. Thank you for your kind and fair message", " I am so sorry for your losses, life really isn\u2019t fair. I will make amends when I\u2019m in a better head space, Thankyou for telling your story", "Having a baby through the public system in Australia is free, with the exception of ultrasounds at some imaging places.\n\nAustralia is also experiencing a shortage of psychologists, so it's incredibly difficult to find one in a timely manner.", "In some states in Australia you can get IVF through the public system which is basically free, it\u2019s just a long wait.", "Thankyou so much for making me feel validated. I am so sorry for your loss, it\u2019s both sad and comforting that I know I will never forget this baby. Thank you stranger for your kindness and understanding. I will definitely repair things with my family but not right now I\u2019m still hurting too much.", "We don\u2019t know why they announced so soon. Yes she can be upset and want to be distant for a little while, but sending that text was unnecessary.", "Well done. This takes courage.", "That is very interesting. So it sounds like therapy is the same process? Unless you have money to find your own outside of the queue?", "No- we don\u2019t know why they announced so soon. What we do know is that it was insensitive- they could have waited at least a few more weeks. \n\nAnd I love how so many are mad about *a text*. When OP has had a stillbirth.", "Because people are still going to live their lives regardless of that. Yes, it is horrible that happened to her, and it\u2019s a pain I don\u2019t wish on anyone. But she could have done the mature thing, waited until she felt calmer and spoken to her brother about her feelings instead of lashing out on him when she doesn\u2019t know the full story. Her having a stillbirth, as awful as that is, does not absolve her of any wrongdoing here", "I honestly don\u2019t understand how so many people are seeing this story in such simplistic terms. Like \u201coh well, these things happen, OP needs to have a shower and carry on\u201d. Where\u2019s the support from her own family?! \n\nThis is why pregnancy loss is hardly spoken about.", "She\u2019s not going to get support if she\u2019s lashing out. I totally get where you\u2019re coming from, I do. But again, we don\u2019t know why the brother announced so early and so I\u2019m not gonna fault him for that. She can\u2019t attack him and then ask for his support. I never said OP needs to \u201chave a shower and carry on\u201d, no one has. She needs counseling desperately, that\u2019s what everyone is saying", ">Where\u2019s the support from her own family?!\n\n\nReally? Did Op say the family didn't support...aren't supporting her or is she talking a separate issue?"]}
