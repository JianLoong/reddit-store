There is no 12 weeks law. It is just something SOME people do, SOMETIMES. \n\n3) the world doesn\u2019t resolve around you. They cannot stop to live because of your loss. \n\n\n4) your text was very inappropriate. They didn\u2019t tell you. They protected you.

Would you really have been okay with the news? \nThe fact they haven\u2019t responded yet also speaks volumes to me. They know you\u2019re upset. They didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did. And that\u2019s also probably why she\u2019s defending them. She knows she messed up telling you the news, and sees you\u2019re taking it out on the wrong person.", "YTA. \n\nYou used your own pain to colour your interpretation of events and you turned your pain against them in a most vicious way. \n\nAll you had to say was, congratulations. One word. That\u2019s all it would have taken. You didn\u2019t even have to mean it but it was the mature and polite thing to do. \n\nInstead you have upset everyone in the family.

Yes because people can totally plan when they get pregnant \ud83d\ude44 also, there is no \u201crule\u201d about when you announce you\u2019re pregnant.", "I understand your loss and the difficulties TTC. I really and truly do. \n\nHowever, you messaging them to call them cruel assholes was 100% uncalled for. I understand you are hurting and grieving, but they did nothing wrong. Tradition is not law, and you were told in a manner to allow you to deal with your emotions without an audience.\n\nThey don't have to wait to announce their pregnancy, and honestly a couple of weeks wouldn't have made any difference because it would still be soon after your loss. There is no way for them to handle this that wouldn't have hurt you.\n\nSo even though I am really sympathetic to your loss, I am going to vote YTA.", "Gentle YTA. I'm so very sorry for your loss. Be kind to yourself, but I think you will regret how harsh you were. If you two have been this close, is this really how you want the relationship to end?\n\nI agree that it would have been better for them to wait, but I'm not sure the news would have been any easier on you a month from now. It was always going to hurt, a lot. Sharing it while you weren't present shows some consideration for your feelings, so I think they were probably trying to do what they thought would be easier on you even if they messed up.", "You're feelings are valid....I am so sorry for your loss. It doesn't excuse your behavior tho. \n\nYes....it would've been nice of they waited tilv12 weeks but your mother is correct....today or 5 weeks from now you still would've been upset. And most people could care less about tradition now. It all would've still been too soon. But they can't put their life on hold. \n\nAnd you said how close you and your brother are. I doubt he is being cruel.  Honestly....they may be thinking they are adding a lil sunshine to the family's sorrow.", "So sorry for your loss, but please don't turn your hurt onto your brother and his wife. You mother is right: it really wouldn't matter when he shared his news. It's heartbreaking for you either way. Take care.", "NAH. You're grieving and it was kind of a harsh move to announce their pregnancy right after what you've been through, but you can't be mad with them not waiting 12 weeks.", "YTA.  Geez.  It is one thing to not congratulate them but it is beyond an AH move to text them and calling them cruel AH. You are beyond an AH. \n\nI hope your brother and wife cut you off permanently even if at some point in time you come to your senses on how ridiculous your action were.", "oh god, definitely NTA. I wonder if this was the extended family wanting to \"move on\" to a different baby, which is such an incredibly fucked up mindset to have. Like, do they not understand that things hurt less given more time? \nI kinda agree that this was always going to be painful for you, but it could have been *less* painful.\n\nIf they had announced 5 weeks later, I would have said N A H, but the fact that they announced earlier than normal and the fact that your mother thinks she has any fucking right to tell you how you can and cannot feel when you are recovering from an extremely traumatic event makes them AH's.\n\nSidenote: The trend of religious people having no understanding of trauma (especially other people's) is so frustrating. IMO any god who would allow you to go through what you went through isn't worth praying to.", "NTA NTA NTA: I\u2019m incredibly sorry for your loss. I\u2019m actually surprised there\u2019s so many Y  T  As here.\n\nWhile your reaction may seem extreme towards your brother, what you\u2019ve been through *is* extreme. Infertility, almost IVF, falling pregnant, needing to terminate and giving birth. And your brother couldn\u2019t wait for the cremation before sharing his pregnancy news?! It\u2019s cruel.\n\nWithout reading too much into your sibling relationship, I think you need a break from him, especially since you\u2019ll be watching his wife\u2019s pregnancy.\n\nAgain, sorry for your loss.", "This seems like an unpopular opinion but NTA. I completely understand that what OP texted was very hurtful to her brother and his wife. But in my opinion\u2026 the hurt the text would cause them is not comparable to the pain she\u2019s experiencing by going through a stillbirth. People often say terrible things when they\u2019re suffering. Does that make it ok? Of course not. Does that mean the victim of their words aren\u2019t allowed to be hurt? Of course not. But I think that unless OP has always been a \u201cself centered\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d person, then it\u2019s very clear this text was only a response to her horrific suffering right now. If I were in her brother or SIL\u2019s shoes I would be very hurt, I would probably put some distance throughout the pregnancy, but then ultimately I will try to reconcile. At the end of the day, *someone* needs to take the higher road, and despite the fact that OP is the one who technically did something wrong, I think the disparity between her suffering and the way her brother and SIL will suffer from these texts means that it is her brother and SIL who should have more empathy once they are ready to communicate with OP again.", "I think your reaction is completely understandable, even though it may be a little bit over the top. Even though I\u2019m a 18yo guy and don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be pregnant, I think that what your brother and sister in law did was unnecessarily cruel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He didn\u2019t tell you, your mom did, so you could have time to privately process it rather than hearing it in a group. This gave you the opportunity to think before you lashed out. But you did it anyway. It is so sad that you lost your baby. But this is happy news for your brother and you should have recognized that. The world moves on. Clearly she was already pregnant before you even lost your child and even if not, they are not going to put their family on hold for a year so you can mourn. \n\nSend your brother an apology and congratulations. Then give yourself some space. I get that you are deeply sad but you have no right to lash out at others like that. You just aren\u2019t thinking straight right now.", "When I was grieving, it felt strange seeing people doing their thing, smiling, laughing, celebrating, enjoying the weather...because my own world had turned black. There was this weird contrast between the hell I felt internally and the sheer normalcy around me.\n\nThen I thought...I wonder how many times I've passed a person who was dealing with their own hell while I was obliviously enjoying my life? 1000s of times. Our grief is our own. We don't stop our lives for others, either...all we can do is be sensitive.\n\nGrief can't be shared or we'd all be depressed, all the time. It's just one of those things. I'm very sorry for your loss - loss is hell but try not to push people away...it's easy to become bitter and want to blame others but it doesn't change anything. You won't forget your baby, that's all that matters.", "NAH \n\nJust a really horrible situation overall. I'm sure there is a reason for the announcement being at this time (my sister announced at I think 8 weeks, so not uncommon) and they seemed to do everything in their power to protect you. \n\nWas your response aggressive and unnecessary? Yeah. But you are going through what I'm sure is the hardest time of your life right now, and grief can hit in such weird ways. I remember lashing out at my younger cousin for saying the word 'nan' after my Gran passed away. It can really hit you. \n\nDoes that excuse what you said? Not at all. But I think once you give yourself some time you can mend things. Even a message stating that things are hard right now and to give you some time while you grieve and you can make things right when you are beginning to heal. Something to show them you're sorry while you are still unable to confront the situation.\n\nShit situations and shit reactions don't make you a bad person. It's how you react to what you've done. I'm sure you'll be alright, friend. Make sure you mend things with your brother and SIL, and give yourself some leniency, you're grieving and healing. Slow and steady.", "Kindly, you should not be seeking judgment right now. What you\u2019ve been through is physically, emotionally, and psychologically horrible and your emotions are fully on the surface. \n\nBut you did come here for judgment. So- ESH. You for the text.

If OP always believes that her brother is cruel, it will be impossible for her brother to take the high road. I completely understand OP is not in her right mind now. And that is completely understandable. But at some point she should reassess her actions. Otherwise she will alienate everyone and her depression will be even worse.", "I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nYou're angry. You're furious that this has happened, because how could it? How could it happen to you? Why did it happen? How is it right or fair? That is grief. \n\nYou've taken that anger and aimed it at your brother. You look at him having this child, and you're angry. He already has one. How can he have another when you just lost yours? All you want is one baby, and now he gets to have two, and it isn't fair! It isn't fair that they are experiencing that joy when you are mourning the loss of all your child was to you already, and all they could have been. How is that right or fair? That is grief. \n\nYou can tell me if I'm wrong, but that is what I think is going through your head. Grief is normal, but you cannot allow it to make you irrational and unreasonable. You cannot allow it to make you bitter and angry. Something truly awful has happened, and that pain may ease, but it won't go away, so if you cannot get a handle on this, it will poison all the relationships in your life. You have to learn to manage the pain and eventually find happiness. \n\nYour brother doesn't deserve your anger. It isn't his fault.

I know I experienced postpartum depression as well, which I unfortunately did not treat. Termination is illegal in my state and I wasn\u2019t able to talk about my experience or share it with many people, which made my feelings of grief and depression so much worse than I think it would have been if I could have done it differently.

You don't necessarily need a therapist to help you deal with grief and loss(because you mentioned in another comment that you don't get free therapy and that it's expensive). You just need each other. Go on a week long trip to some remote area with your husband for some alone time and some quiet. I come from a country where therapy is not widespread and it's basically a rich man's treatment or for people who are clinically diagnosed with something.

And then to top it off they were too cowardly to tell you themselves, and got your mum to do it.\n\nYour mum is an AH as well, she should have shut it down immediately, and definitely not told you if those other AHs couldn\u2019t be persuaded to delay their news, and her continued support of them is disgusting.\n\n2 weeks\u2026.. that is barely enough time to understand what happened, forget about actually processing it and dealing with the tremendous amount of emotional and physical trauma you are experiencing, you are likely still wondering if it is just a horrible nightmare that you will wake up from.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think your message went far enough - I would have attacked their god as well, as what god would ever do anything like that.\n\nThe only thing that the people who are telling you that you are an AH have right is that you and your husband need therapy to help you come to terms with it, and try to move forward with your lives.", "INFO\n\nWhat happened to you is *bitterly* unfair. It's diabolically cruel. If they did ask your mother to tell you at 7 weeks, I don't see you being the AH in any way at all. If they didn't and your mother just decided to tell you, then as gently as I can say it, that is AH behaviour and quite frankly, your mother is the AH.\n\nAnd, god, you must have heard this a thousand times, but I'm so very sorry for what happened. You've been through a lot, way too much, so take your time to heal and be kind to your mental and physical states and remember there's no time limit on grief. You were getting out of bed again which is such a huge and important step when all you want is to hide from the world.", "Reddit is so strange NTA you are not suppose to announce until 12 weeks. They decide to tell everyone when you literally just lost your baby at 7 weeks when it is there second?! Now, would it have been any easier to hear, no, it wouldn\u2019t but my god if you were my sister I never would have even considered saying anything so early.", "YTA - the main character syndrom. They didnt even tell you, it was your Mother. If anyone was a soft asshole it would be your Mom maybe. I bet if they waited till 12 weeks or whatever you would react the same.", "I am so, so sorry for what you have been through. Ruling NAH, because your brother wasn't trying to be cruel.", "NTA death of a baby trumps news of another every time\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if because you mention they\u2019re \u2018super religious\u2019 if they\u2019re punishing you for terminating (even tho there was literally no other option) \n\nMaybe your text was a little harsh but still NTA", "NTA, and I'm not sure your brother is either, since it was your mother who told you, which was cruel since it was so close to your own loss.

I'm very sorry for your loss.", "Normally I might say YTA, but post partum is a bitch so NTA.", "YTA in a way but it\u2019s sort of okay cause your grieving but still YTA. They were respectful of your loss and didn\u2019t tell you themselves. No matter when they chose to tell people you\u2019d probably still be mad. Your grief is where your behavior is coming from and it\u2019s not okay. It\u2019s okay to feel but you need to get some help and this is coming from someone who is also experiencing grief and not handling it well. So I feel okay in saying YTA. Cause Im an asshole too. Grief is wild and makes you think and behave in such irrational ways. We are justified in how we feel in that moment but need to come back to reality at some point and see where we were so wrong. They aren\u2019t being selfish in living their life but you\u2019re taking it personal because of your loss. You cannot remove your hurt from their happiness and until you deal with it you won\u2019t ever be happy for them. You need to apologize. You don\u2019t have to wish her well but you need to say sorry for how you behaved. Im sure they\u2019ll be more than understanding since they already thought of you in the beginning. Be kinder to yourself. Confide in people with how you feel. Get a journal. Go seek counseling. Life is still going to move on regardless of the loss we experience. Everyone is still going to push forward while you feel stuck in time. Find a good way to cope. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I hope you take care of yourself.", " YTA. Sorry for your loss that is a tragedy, but being mad at someone else for being pregnant is not the way to go. And that waiting for 12 weeks thing is not a rule, I wait until then to announce publically but I tell my close family members as soon as I find out I\u2019m expecting for a number of reasons. (One reason being that morning sickness is really bad during the first trimester why should a pregnant woman suffer in silence until the second trimester?) also did you ever think that your mom and other members of the family may have been affected by the loss as well, obviously not anywhere near as severely as you, but that was her grandchild as well and people cope a lot of different ways.", "I am so sorry for your loss, but YTA in this situation.

So unless you're very close to (or over) 40, I feel that your level of anxiety and obsession with getting pregnant are extreme and unhealthy for you, and will be unhealthy for any future pregnancy. (Actually, even if you are around 40 it still sounds extreme)\n\nI'm very sorry for what you're going through, I can't even imagine how traumatic a loss under these circumstances can be. But I think you need to first heal mentally and change your mindset before trying again, or you'll risk starting a second pregnancy with even more stress and anxiety than the first one, and that *will* affect the baby.\n\nAs for this particular situation, I'm wondering if maybe your brother and SIL didn't decide to share their news early to bring some happiness to the rest of your family who are grieving your loss? I know to you it felt like a low blow, but also you can't expect them to put their lives on hold while you go through this.", "YTA.  It wouldn't have mattered when they announced the pregnancy,  It's going to be brutal on you.  That's just straight up truth and you have every right to be angry with the world.  You don't have the right to take it out on your brother and his wife.  The way you messaged them was rude and uncalled for.", "YTA but grief can make people irrational. My brother and SIL have struggled to conceive, and when I got unexpectedly pregnant, I was excited but also immediately very sad for them. I didn\u2019t want to tell them. I didn\u2019t want to see the pain on their faces. But I was still entitled to be excited about my baby, while still mourning their losses. She\u2019s two now and honestly, they still hurt sometimes being around her. I made them godparents and they have a special relationship with her, but I know they carry pain and resentment. And that\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t imagine struggling to conceive, losing multiple babies, and then someone you\u2019re close to just becomes pregnant easily. Life is very complicated and hard sometimes. Your brother and his wife deserve to be excited right now. That doesn\u2019t take anything away from what you\u2019ve been through.

It's grief, anger, rage, and hate that is going to put a wedge between you and your loved ones. \n\nPlease find a support group. They can be lanterns in this very dark time.\n\nThe message to your brother was uncalled for. BUT I can see why you sent it.", "Full on AH. YTA. Yes, it absolutely is horrible you lost your baby. ESP in that matter. But expecting others to hide their happiness just to make you feel better? That screams entitled brat to me.", "Soft YTA, I really hope you can talk to a therapist.  Please get some help. Don't deal with this on your own. Please make sure your spouse has some support, too.\n\nTell your mum you are getting help, and plan to apologize to both your brother and SIL. You need to. You know, in your heart,  that you were in the wrong. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. I wish nothing but healing to you.", "I'm sorry but, YTA.  You can't expect people to put their lives on hold bc you're hurting.  It's true, it doesn't matter when they announce it, it's going to hurt.  Not everyone waits the 12 weeks to announce a pregnancy.  There's no rule about that.  Just bc they did it with the first one doesn't mean they have to wait to announce the second one.  As difficult as it's going to be to watch her go through her pregnancy, they have done nothing wrong.", "OP. My heart breaks for you. Life is so cruel and unfair, and you are undergoing the harshest thing a human has to suffer - the loss of a child. And without minimising your grief and sorrow - YTA. \n\nBut I believe it is a YTA without malice, and one brought on by the fog of sadness you are mired in. \n\nI think you yourself will realise as time passes that you acted in haste and allowed your grief to guide your rage. \n\nGently, what you are saying is irrational. 12 weeks is an arbitrary measure that society imposes on women, and guilts them and shames them of outcomes regardless. As your tragic story shows, noone is \"safe\" at any point. Plus this is not \"announcing\". This is merely sharing with your close family members - I had told my parents and my sibling that I was pregnant pretty much by the time the pee was dry on the stick. \n\nSecond pregnancies are harder to hide and if they have a little one at home, they may not want her to spill the beans. \n\nThey also showed so much compassion to your situation and allowed your mother to break the news to you individually. They did not tell you, they did not approach you, they didn't rub it in your face. They are clearly good people. \n\nYour reaction was totally off the handle, but given your grief, and your close relationship with your brother I'm sure they will forgive you. Reach out and apologize. \n\nAnd when you feel like -  share with them, and your family, and even here with us if you would like about your baby. What was their name? I'm sharing something I read - and I hope it gives you comfort - all they knew was love \ud83d\udc96.

I don\u2019t feel they should\u2019ve announced it as you\u2019re going through what you are, especially since your baby hasn\u2019t even had an autopsy yet. But maybe they were trying to bring some light to a dark time in your families life. \n\nI would be just as angry as you though if they had announced it then. But I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve sent the text message - no one can say what they would do in a moment like what you\u2019re experiencing right now. \n\nMaybe send a text to brother and apologize - but tell him you need space from his family during this time. \n\nAgain, I hope you do start feeling better and are able to get some therapy or have someone you can talk to because it\u2019s not fair what happened to you and your feelings are valid.", "Understandable, but YTA. I wouldn't call you TA for not congratulating your brother, but for sure for the mean words and claims of ending the relationship. You definitely owe your brother an apology, but hopefully he understands and won't give you a hard time.", "YTA No wonder your brother didn't want to be the one to tell you. You would have found something to be mad at 12 weeks for, too. Your brother not having problems and living his life is not slapping you in the face.", "Gentle YTA. Your brother didn\u2019t cause what happened to you, nor did he wave his pregnancy in your face to gloat. You\u2019re grieving, and grief can make people irrational. I would apologize to your brother and wife, and then kindly ask them to give you space right now until you\u2019ve had some time to process your own pain.", "YTA, your loss is awful but not anyone else\u2019s issue to work around.\n\nHonestly, if I were then I wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with you right now given your reaction. \n\nThey deserve happiness during their pregnancy even if you had a different experience.\n\nSigned- went through infertility and you are way out of line", "It doesn\u2019t ever seem right to call someone who lost a child an AH but yes, YTA. It seems like they definitely took what precautions they could not to upset you as much as possible. You say you wish they waited 5 more weeks, but honey you lost a child, your grief isn\u2019t going to be any less when they are 12 weeks pregnant or now. For you, there will never be a right time for them to announce, it will hurt you either way. \n\nYou need to understand that for others life does go on. I remember when we took my mom off life support and she passed, I was in the Hall and I watched nurses calmly talk where they wanted to order their lunch from. It was a reminder that while it seems like the world stopped for me, it\u2019s still spinning for everyone else.", "YTA. Your pain is not an excuse to lash out. You would end your relationship with your sibling because their wife is pregnant? That\u2019s awful. \n\nYou have a lot of growing up to do. How are you going to be a good parent if you treat those closest to you like garbage just because you\u2019re grieving?", "YTA, while what happened to you is tragic and you have to grieve in your own time we all know that this was going to be painful no matter when they announced. Your loss doesn\u2019t mean others have to hide their pregnancies or children. To cut your brother off over his wife being pregnant is unreasonable and when your grief settles you will realize that. When you get pregnant again you\u2019ll want people to be happy for you, but that will be difficult for someone else.

You don\u2019t know me, and have no reason to believe me\u2026but I get it. What you\u2019re doing here is taking all that anger and pain that you (rightly) have for the cruelty and unfairness of losing your baby, and have projected it onto two people that haven\u2019t actually done anything wrong.

I'm not familiar with the feeling of loosing a child, but I truly feel your pain and I hope you'll get through this horrible time\n\nThat said, what the actual fuck did I just read in the end? You sent an abusive message to your brother because he dared to say him and his wife are having another baby? I know that you're in grief, I truly get that, but that doesn't give you a pass to be so vile. \n\nYour title is also misleading. Its not that you didn't congratulate him, it's that you sent a horrible message calling him names and breaking your bond. Truly, you need serious help. Also, since they weren't even the ones to tell you, it truly seems like they might have waited but your mom figured she could still tell you. Most likely had hope you wouldn't be so horrible.", "Yta. People trying to get pregnant unsuccessfully go through some crazy brain chemistry that seems to prevent them from being happy for anyone else, which leads to people letting a lot of bad manners and impropriety slide. The fact is that you don't have a right to be nasty to people just because you haven't had a successful pregnancy. It's your personal tragedy, not anyone else's. Other people going through good things is not an attack against you.", "Yup, YTA, a bit. This is a big moment for them and you want them to walk on eggshells for you by calculating just precisely the timing they use to let the world know of their wonderful moment. If you worked in an office and one of your associates got the promotion you wanted, I am guessing you would not congratulate them and think even their achievement should not be celebrated near you. I'm sorry to say, the world doesn't revolve around you and however sad your setback is, that is a happy moment for someone else. If you're that sensitive, then good luck in life. It's not just about you.", "Light YTA\n\nSometimes pregnancies are announced as soon as the couple find out they're pregnant. I'm so sorry for your loss. It sucks and while you want the world to just stop, it won't. Life doesn't stop and you can't control when someone shares their news. They know you're hurting, so they made sure you weren't there when they broke the news. \n\nDo you think you would have felt any better even if they had waited a few weeks? Few months even? You went through a horrible loss.

And that grief will never really go away. But the world around you carries on. You will see people pregnant and people giving birth to healthy babies and it will hit you hard. Life isn\u2019t fair. But it\u2019s also not fair to expect the rest of the world to stop just because yours has. \n\nYour brother didn\u2019t want to tell you. But he is allowed to be excited for his own happy time and to want to share it with the people he cares about. There\u2019s no rule about when to announce a pregnancy and it could even be that they\u2019ve watched your suffering and wanted to bring their own support system into the loop a little earlier so that they know they have people who love them around them. Having a baby is a scary time, even if everything goes perfectly. But if it doesn\u2019t, having people around you to support you is exactly what you need. Don\u2019t deny them that just because you\u2019re hurting. \nAllow yourself time to grieve and for your body to heal.

I understand the simultaneous noisy and silent mound of racing thoughts.\n\n**Your feelings are valid and so are your emotions**, but don't project them on others. If you're feeling overwhelmed by emotions/depression, then find an outlet that's harmless (writing, painting, cooking, exercise, photography, etc.) or even one of those \"smash rooms\" to get it out. Idk if you've tried it yet, but connecting with other women in an anonymous group setting may also help you with being able to talk with others you can relate to on a deeper level who have experienced this.\n\nYou are going to get through this. You are not alone. It just requires time and introspection.", "We lost our first pregnancy very early on. I had so much uncertainty that we would ever be able to conceive due to my PCOS and other factors. So when we found out we were expecting, I was overjoyed. Everything felt like it finally made sense. Then the rug was ripped out from under us.   \n\nMy husband\u2019s side of the family didn\u2019t know what we were going through. 2 months later, BIL and his wife announced they were expecting their second child. I was so, so bitter. Of course they had no idea, and I congratulated them. \n\nI had to unfollow a lot of new moms/expecting couples on Facebook because even though people didn\u2019t know what we were going through-other people\u2019s joy triggered my own grief and bitterness so bad that it felt like a personal attack from the universe. \n\nIt was a dark time for me. I was crying constantly, angry with God, the universe, everything. I started seeing a therapist weekly and things got a little better.\n\nAll of this to say, while I can\u2019t imagine the pain and grief that you\u2019re in specifically, I can empathize and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nI can\u2019t make a judgement here because I know how grief and anger can cast a cloud over everything. It\u2019s hard to remember that a good thing happening to someone else is not a bad thing happening to you. They didn\u2019t get pregnant to spite you. I feel you may have had the same reaction if they announced at 12 weeks instead of 7. \n\nPut some distance in if you need to for your own mental and emotional well-being.

But I don't blame you for the initial lashing to begin with, if anything,  you affirmed that him not telling you was the right decision.

But unfortunately I lean YTA. They didn't purposefully get pregnant just to hurt you, they are not obligated to wait 12 weeks and might have had reasons for the announcement (maybe they didn't, and in that case you are absolutely right that waiting would have been the more sensible thing to do). Not congratulating is one thing and is perfectly acceptable in your situation.

I felt like it was unintentionally cruel to announce it so soon after my babies death, my baby is still laying dead on a slab in a morgue awaiting an autopsy and cremation and they couldn\u2019t even wait for that.\n\nIm sorry t say but this is in your head.  They can choose to announce their pregnancy at whatever point in time.  This is blunt and I apologize but the rest of the world doesnt stop bc of your tragedy and that includes other child births announcements.\n\nI recognize this is a cross that you must bear.

I am so sorry for your loss.\nHowever, you are bleeding on people who did not cut you. \n\nYour brother and his wife have all the rights to get pregnant and announce it when they want to. They did not announce the pregnancy to you. Your brother told his mom. People tell close family about their pregnancies. Given that she is also your mom, she chose to share this news with you. Unfortunately you saw this as an insult to your loss. \nYou went a step further and insulted them. Really? \n\nI have had multiple losses and during that time I watched my family and friends carry healthy pregnancies to term while mine ended in the most excruciating miscarriages.

Ask yourself if this really would have felt any less awful in two weeks or five weeks.   Probably not.

Also, just because they are currently pregnant doesn\u2019t in anyway automatically translate into them forgetting YOUR child. I\u2019m not particularly religious myself, but have friends who are (you state brother and SIL are) and they are often the most cognizant of honoring and remembering a pre-term loss. I\u2019d you give them a chance, they may be very supportive of helping to remember your child. \n\nAlso, personally, I\u2019ve never made it to 12 weeks without sharing our news with our parents. People do that because loss is most common in the first trimester.

You're not necessarily a selfish person, your self just needs attention right now so that you dont lash out unfairly and it isnt sure where to find comfort and soothing for something so awful.

That's a whole level of \"let's upset you and constantly remind you of what you're NOT going to have.\"\n\nIt's not about sparing the feelings or sensibility of others, rather reducing unintended hurt or trauma of the almost mother.", "Her brother announced their pregnancy to the family before OP\u2019s baby has even been laid to rest. He had a choice not to do that.", "I will definitely look into it, Thankyou for the suggestion.", "Everyone is focusing on the IVF and medical expenses but if they can\u2019t afford therapy how were they planning to afford actually raising a child? They are hella expensive I thought?", "People that downvote you should be ashamed of themselves. Stillbirth is one of the most horrific experience a woman get have. Sending you love.", "ONs will do a blood test before 7 weeks to confirm\u2026. I knew at 5 weeks because if this and gladly shared.\n\nWr have NO idea why they announced at that time. \n\nPoint is anyone can share whenever they want to.", "Of course it does. I\u2019m sure OP would want to believe otherwise but experience tells a different story. I\u2019m sorry to hear you also have personal experience of this.", "This is a bot! Report as spam!", "I can\u2019t pretend that I can comprehend your loss but maybe you can text your brother in the meantime and say I need more time to heal first but I hope you understand and we can talk together and work through this soon.\n\n\nHopefully he responds by saying he\u2019ll wait and he loves you", "It's completely understandable. You sound like an overall rational person who is DROWNING in grief right now. Grief makes us do some weird things. Take the time you need to grieve, get counseling if you can, and you'll make amends, as you said. I think that, given how close you and your brother are, he'll forgive you. Sending you a hundred internet hugs, and I'm so sorry you're going through this.", "Same. I remember my twin's first pregnancy, I don't forget my first niece, but who in their right mind would bring something like this up?!", "Except the whole \u201cdon\u2019t tell anyone early in case you lose it\u201d is exactly what keeps it taboo.", "The mother would have to tell people either way, you think people lose a baby and never talk to their family or friends about it?\n\nPeople like you are the reason mental health suffers for pregnant people by acting like it should be something we don\u2019t share at all.", "But you have just described taboo. If you\u2019re comfortable sharing the news with the people you are close too, then you should be comfortable in sharing the loss if so. Some people are comfortable in sharing the tragedy of loss. There is no \u201csafe\u201d moment in pregnancy, even in infancy. There\u2019s no difference sharing at 7 weeks and 12 weeks if you\u2019re comfortable in sharing the possibility of loss. And people on their second, third ect, are more comfortable in sharing earlier.", "The brother and SIL are allowed to be happy and announce their pregnancy.", "Did he? Do we even know? Did his wife have a bad bout of morning sickness and someone guessed? Did a close family friend run into her at her OB appointment and they had to say something? Did her family find out and start talking about it, so they had to tell his family for it to be fair? We don't know. What we do know is that they were thoughtful enough to not go directly to OP and announce it to her; they didn't actually tell her at all.", "Because OP was going to find out in any case.  Do you think OP would be happier if she had read about it on social media, or had someone else who knows casually mention it?", "They can\u2019t decline your need for therapy? I would go back to your gp, as an aus nurse I\u2019ve never heard being rejected for the mental health plan", "Yeah and that\u2019s just necessary medical expenses for them. What if their kid needed therapy?", "Of course it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure OP would want to believe otherwise but experience tells a different story. I\u2019m sorry to hear you also have personal experience of this.", "Dude stop. I am in no way, sharp or form shaming a mother from sharing her pain. I am not shitting on mental health. Nor, am I stating they have to suffer alone and in quiet. No one should be ashamed of talking about their pain.\n\nIn reality, I am stating some women don't want to talk about miscarriage in an attempt to spare themselves the pain. Talking about it makes it real for them. Talking about it reopens (not that it closes) the wound for them. It hurt telling people over and over again that you lost the baby.\n\nAnd yes, a lot of people have miscarriage and don't tell people. They don't want to tell people. they don't have to tell people.", "This is 2hat I was going to say \n\nOP is it possible that your mother told you earlier precisely because of your tragic loss, and they thought that it would be best if they told you sooner  rather than it inadvertently come up elsewhere.", "It might just be one clinic who has rejected bulk-billing their plan", "Yeah even private psychologists are quite busy now and depending on where you live if it\u2019s not a big city you could be waiting a while. There was more access to teleheath like video calls during Covid but they may have scaled back now. You can call around to many doctors offices to see if they have room but it does take a lot of time; which when you\u2019re grieving or already in need of support may not be emotionally feasible.", "Ok but that\u2019s not for another 6-10 years. Who knows about their financial situation that far in advance?", "It\u2019s not as common for people to get therapy outside of the US", "Maybe it\u2019s speech/motor skills therapist and it\u2019s needed in 2 years. Or maybe never at all. But the point is kids (babies included) come with loads of unexpected expenses.", "Ok 3 years then. Still. A lot can still change in that time.", "My uncle just died did you stop living your life to mourn his loss? No. It sucks her baby died but she behaved badly and lashed out when she should be getting therapy and being that she is depressed needs to find some joy.", "Well if her brother is making early pregnancy announcements between her own babies stillbirth and cremation, I\u2019d say he isn\u2019t supporting her. And her mother is defending her brother as well, so not much support there\u2026", "\u2026 it\u2019s completely different having a stillborn baby to losing your uncle. She lost her baby weeks ago- therapy won\u2019t help that much right now. She literally will not find joy- your responses are too glib.", "You just love being wrong. Only AH is OP.", ">I\u2019d say he isn\u2019t supporting her. \n\nAll Op said of her brother is that they are close. So \"'I'l say\" he has been supporting her\"\n\nAnd her mother isn't the target of Op's anger so \"I'l say\" It is because she has also been supportive of Op. \n\n\n\"I'l also say\" That the mother is defending the brother because SHE NOT the brother, gave Op the information.", "Death is death. How is it any different? My uncle raised me taunt me everything kept me from living on the streets when others abandoned me. \n\nShe needs help and she did an asshole move. Stop covering for her. She admits it in her posts."]}
