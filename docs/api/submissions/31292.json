He explained we were going grocery shopping, and his dad invited himself to tag along and said he would meet us there. My husband and I got there first, and were mid-conversation with some of the people working the cell phone kiosk about switching over our phone plans when I felt tugging on my cart with my 1 year old in it. My heart sank and as I turned around I see my FIL trying to take my cart with my son saying \u201che\u2019s coming with me!\u201d.\n\nNo \u201chi\u201d, no \u201ccan I take him for a walk?\u201d, nothing but a demanding \u201che\u2019s coming with me!\u201d. I was shocked & caught off guard as I was in the middle of a conversation, and responded with \u201cno he\u2019s fine here with me, thanks\u201d. He then said \u201cwell he wants me, he\u2019s coming with me\u201d and I again firmly stated that my son was fine with me. Now, anyone who has known me the last year knows I am very protective of my baby. I don\u2019t like him being out of my sight at all, let alone in a big, crowded, public space like costco, so I\u2019m not sure why he thought trying to wrestle my cart from me in this setting was a good idea in the first place, but walking off out of sight with my baby is and has always been a hard no for me. I get I may be a little over the top, over protective, etc.. but its my boundary and I think I communicated and enforced it kindly given the circumstances. He now won\u2019t speak to us, and stormed off and said he was going home.\n\nAITA?\n\n*edit* \n\nTo be clear, my FIL and I have always been incredibly close. My husband often jokes that I am his \u201cfavourite child\u201d (he has two children of his own). Although I am extremely uncomfortable with my baby out of sight, my FIL is also in terrible shape with two bum knees and often tries to walk around while carrying my bubba which to me is a safety concern that I have yet to address. He is also not used to hearing \u201cno\u201d often, especially from me, which is where I think the upset is coming from.

Doesn't matter if you're super okay with this or not at all. No one should be taking your child without letting you know first, that's gradually teaching your kid it's okay to go off without your notice. Your FIL is way over the top bossy.", "NTA. My mother in law is like this and it's always driven me nuts. My kids are older now and it still gets under my skin. Example:  we were camping and I sent my 7M to use the bathroom. It was a bit of a walk from our campsite, but I could see it from where I was sitting. My mil was already in the bathroom and she and my son came out at the same time. She invited him to the park ( out of sight from the campsite) and they walked there immediately. \n\nWhy do grandparents think they can just take their grandkids without communicating with their parents? I saw her take him to the park, but if I hadn't and he didn't return from the bathroom, I would have panicked. \n\nIf FIL had asked \"you mind if I take grandson for a stroll while you're here. I'll meet you back in 15 min.\" Then you'd be an AH. But grandpa didn't communicate or show respect for you, of course you felt prickly when he wordlessly walked up to snatch the cart. Sounds like a good talk with you inlaws would go a long way.", "NTA\n\nI get the feeling he invited himself along because he wanted to see the baby or was lonely.\n\nPossibly not handled in the best way by either of you, but you have boundaries and he should respect them.", ">He now won\u2019t speak to us\n\nSounds like a win to me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f NTA", "NTA, weird behaviour from him.", "NTA.

What would he have done if you had taken your hand off the cart and hadn't felt him tugging on it?  Just walked off with your child without your knowledge?\n\nMy father would have either walked into my line of sight, or in some way made me aware of his presence before asking, or at least suggesting, that he could take baby while we finished our business. And if I said no, he certainly wouldn't have pitched a hissy fit and gone home.", "NTA. He didn't even ask. Just tried to tske him from you, then said he was taking him. Your kid your rules", "NTA. You can do without any of this.", "NTA-You and your husband are the ones that decide what boundaries are when it comes to your child. FIL doesn\u2019t have to like them but he does have to respect them. If my late FIL had acted like that with one of the grandkids my SIL would have reacted exactly as you did.", "NTA - what is his deal? You don\u2019t just walk up and take the baby without asking. Jeez.", "NTA\n\nwould he have even said anything if you didnt turn around put of reaction to the cart being tugged? Doesnt sound like it to me. I would've told my inlaws the same thing unless they had a huge positive influence in my childs life. Like if they babysit him regularly, etc. Otherwise you're not running off with my child out of my sight", "NTA. What on earth happened to courtesy? Would you like me to take LO for a while? or May I push him for a bit? By grabbing, demanding & going off in a huff I think your FIL is another toddler and should be put in a shopping cart to keep him safe...", "While I'm inclined to go with NTA there's language in your post that suggests you may be leaving out some information.  Yes...you're within your rights as a Mom but your choice of words also suggests you may have borderline control issues.  I get it...the kid is a year old but at what point do you plan on loosening up; will you be the Mom who sits in the back of the class in 2nd grade, will he be allowed to date and marry without your approval or will be you be another nightmarish MIL in the making for some unsuspecting girl?  Again...you're in your rights but allowing grandpa to take the kid for a stroll around Costco hardly seems like he's asking you to let him take him on a trip overseas.", "NAH. Most people intrinsically trust family to take care of family. FIL gave you a heads up without interrupting your conversation. You said no. Doesn't sound like a dispute or poor behavior on either side.", "[deleted]", "NTA. It's your child, your rules. FIL should respect your boundaries and not try to forcefully take your baby without even asking. Your instinct to keep your child safe and close is completely understandable. Stand your ground and don't let anyone make you feel guilty for prioritizing your child's well-being.", "NTA", "NTA. He didn\u2019t have the authority to make that decision, and when you said no he should have respected your answer. He can go pout, but you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. As ever in these scenarios, your child means your rules. Fact is, you said no and he still tried to take your son. A HELL OF A LOT of problems on this thread wouldn\u2019t escalate if people kept to strict boundaries around this kind of behaviour from grandparents or other family members. People don\u2019t seem to want to enforce early for fear of being seen as oversensitive etc which I get, but boy does it escalate.", "NTA He didn\u2019t ask to spend time with your child, he demanded it. When you said no, he tried to dismiss your authority. Not cool.", "NTA \n\nHow do you just come up and demand/order someone that you are taking their child from them in public?\n\nEntitled much?", ">He now won\u2019t speak to us\n\nSounds like a win to me! NTA", "NTA\n\nMy late father used to use the buggy as a control tool. I loved my Dad, adored my Dad but if we were somewhere and he got hold of the buggy, it was game over, he was in control.\n\nOver the 8 years of having kids/ my Dad being with us we had so many fights over the buggy/ trolley. It would be quite undignified at times (but I'm not actually sure Dad even knew he was in a fight?) There was lots of \"shes fine\" or \"I need to lean on this\".", "NTA and it's now up to your husband to reiterate this boundary with his father.  Something to the effect of \"I know you are his grandfather but you cannot just walk up and take our son somewhere without asking permission from one of us.  I know you are not some stranger but this is a hard boundary for us both.  Please keep this in mind next time before we get together again.  And if you want to keep a good relationship with my wife, it would behoove you to apologize for what you tried to do at the store.\"", "NTA. Good for you! Your FIL sounds like a jerk.", "NTA, but (since you and he do have a good relationship) I think it's worth your while to check a few things...\n\n* Is your FIL, older, possibly starting to change some of his behaviors? or his something he might normally do? (If it's normal for him, then you being clear and firm at the time is plenty.)\n* Has your level of protectiveness of your child been an issue in the family?\n* You and husband should go see him and ask to understand what he was thinking and feeling at the time.\n\n1. Did he have it in his mind that he was trying to relieve you of watching your child? Or is he trying to push you to be more comfortable with your child being out of your sight in a crazy crowded place like Costco? (I hope you see that I'm not justifying his thinking; just looking for the reasoning to help you know how best to respond to him.)\n2. Was he just looking for something to do/ wanting to spend time with his grandchild... because he's a little lost or lonely? Was he just bored at that particular moment?\n3. Is his behavior becoming a bit more child-like (e.g., he wants what he wants when he wants it; can understand when he's being told 'no'...)? That might warrant another conversation about some medical screening for issues associated with aging.\n\nI hope you and your husband get some insight into what was going on with him and that clearing the air helps you all going forward.", "NTA\n\nHe just attempted to kidnap your child", "What you describe as your comfort level is a bit much but you are NTA in this situation. \n\nNo person, except your husband, should be walking up and just grabbing your child to walk away. This is not their child, it is your child. The appropriate thing to do would be to ask if you can take the child. If the answer is no, then either go do what you were going to do, then come back and spend time with the child or just stay with the parents.", "YTA. Helicopter parenting is ruining the next crop of children. Not sure why he can\u2019t spend some time with his grandfather. Also I don\u2019t think you\u2019re telling the whole story here\u2026", "I donno, sounds like he was just playing around and you took a lighthearted scenario very seriously. He acted like a normal fun grandparent/auntie/uncle imo.\n\nHis reaction afterwards was childish, so that's not great.\n\nObviously as a parent you get the final say, but you'll need to be prepared for people to be upset that you don\u2019t trust them with a family member, you know?\n\nESH", "Nta,  in this case for sure\n\nI hope you are working on you anxiety,  children need to learn that they can be out of their mothers site and be ok.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
