He explained we were going grocery shopping, and his dad invited himself to tag along and said he would meet us there. My husband and I got there first, and were mid-conversation with some of the people working the cell phone kiosk about switching over our phone plans when I felt tugging on my cart with my 1 year old in it. My heart sank and as I turned around I see my FIL trying to take my cart with my son saying \u201che\u2019s coming with me!\u201d.\n\nNo \u201chi\u201d, no \u201ccan I take him for a walk?\u201d, nothing but a demanding \u201che\u2019s coming with me!\u201d. I was shocked & caught off guard as I was in the middle of a conversation, and responded with \u201cno he\u2019s fine here with me, thanks\u201d. He then said \u201cwell he wants me, he\u2019s coming with me\u201d and I again firmly stated that my son was fine with me. Now, anyone who has known me the last year knows I am very protective of my baby. I don\u2019t like him being out of my sight at all, let alone in a big, crowded, public space like costco, so I\u2019m not sure why he thought trying to wrestle my cart from me in this setting was a good idea in the first place, but walking off out of sight with my baby is and has always been a hard no for me. I get I may be a little over the top, over protective, etc.. but its my boundary and I think I communicated and enforced it kindly given the circumstances. He now won\u2019t speak to us, and stormed off and said he was going home.\n\nAITA?\n\n*edit* \n\nTo be clear, my FIL and I have always been incredibly close. My husband often jokes that I am his \u201cfavourite child\u201d (he has two children of his own). Although I am extremely uncomfortable with my baby out of sight, my FIL is also in terrible shape with two bum knees and often tries to walk around while carrying my bubba which to me is a safety concern that I have yet to address. He is also not used to hearing \u201cno\u201d often, especially from me, which is where I think the upset is coming from.

My mother in law is like this and it's always driven me nuts. My kids are older now and it still gets under my skin. Example:  we were camping and I sent my 7M to use the bathroom. It was a bit of a walk from our campsite, but I could see it from where I was sitting. My mil was already in the bathroom and she and my son came out at the same time. She invited him to the park ( out of sight from the campsite) and they walked there immediately. \n\nWhy do grandparents think they can just take their grandkids without communicating with their parents? I saw her take him to the park, but if I hadn't and he didn't return from the bathroom, I would have panicked. \n\nIf FIL had asked \"you mind if I take grandson for a stroll while you're here. I'll meet you back in 15 min.\" Then you'd be an AH. But grandpa didn't communicate or show respect for you, of course you felt prickly when he wordlessly walked up to snatch the cart.

Just walked off with your child without your knowledge?\n\nMy father would have either walked into my line of sight, or in some way made me aware of his presence before asking, or at least suggesting, that he could take baby while we finished our business.

Yes...you're within your rights as a Mom but your choice of words also suggests you may have borderline control issues.  I get it...the kid is a year old but at what point do you plan on loosening up; will you be the Mom who sits in the back of the class in 2nd grade, will he be allowed to date and marry without your approval or will be you be another nightmarish MIL in the making for some unsuspecting girl?  Again...you're in your rights but allowing grandpa to take the kid for a stroll around Costco hardly seems like he's asking you to let him take him on a trip overseas.", "NAH.

As ever in these scenarios, your child means your rules. Fact is, you said no and he still tried to take your son. A HELL OF A LOT of problems on this thread wouldn\u2019t escalate if people kept to strict boundaries around this kind of behaviour from grandparents or other family members. People don\u2019t seem to want to enforce early for fear of being seen as oversensitive etc which I get, but boy does it escalate.", "NTA He didn\u2019t ask to spend time with your child, he demanded it.

It would be quite undignified at times (but I'm not actually sure Dad even knew he was in a fight?) There was lots of \"shes fine\" or \"I need to lean on this\".", "NTA and it's now up to your husband to reiterate this boundary with his father.  Something to the effect of \"I know you are his grandfather but you cannot just walk up and take our son somewhere without asking permission from one of us.  I know you are not some stranger but this is a hard boundary for us both.  Please keep this in mind next time before we get together again.

(If it's normal for him, then you being clear and firm at the time is plenty.)\n* Has your level of protectiveness of your child been an issue in the family?\n* You and husband should go see him and ask to understand what he was thinking and feeling at the time.\n\n1. Did he have it in his mind that he was trying to relieve you of watching your child? Or is he trying to push you to be more comfortable with your child being out of your sight in a crazy crowded place like Costco?

Was he just looking for something to do/ wanting to spend time with his grandchild... because he's a little lost or lonely? Was he just bored at that particular moment?\n3. Is his behavior becoming a bit more child-like (e.g., he wants what he wants when he wants it; can understand when he's being told 'no'...)? That might warrant another conversation about some medical screening for issues associated with aging.\n\nI hope you and your husband get some insight into what was going on with him and that clearing the air helps you all going forward.", "NTA\n\nHe just attempted to kidnap your child", "What you describe as your comfort level is a bit much but you are NTA in this situation. \n\nNo person, except your husband, should be walking up and just grabbing your child to walk away.

If the answer is no, then either go do what you were going to do, then come back and spend time with the child or just stay with the parents.", "YTA.

All of a sudden a man tries to grab the cart and say the baby is coming with him. No introduction or greeting to indicate this is a safe person.  To anyone looking at it they would assume your baby was being kidnapped.  Which is essentially what he attempted to do.  Normally you trust him but this was a state of shock and you probably didn\u2019t even realize immediately it was him. Yes he is hurt for you saying no but at least he didn\u2019t get the cops called on him.  \n\nPlus your baby is only 1 you don\u2019t know when they need a diaper change, need milk either bottle of breastfed, and a myriad of other things.

Yeah maybe not wanting your child out of your sight at all is eventually something to work on, but at an age where he's nonverbal and helpless still it's not unreasonable. You're his primary carer and advocate and there's no reason anyone needs to take him out of your sight at one year old if they're not actually babysitting, it's not like he'll remember that as a special moment when he's older.\n\nWith my own kids I just never allowed these ad hoc 'running off with the kids' moments when they were too little to look after themselves, it too easily descends into 'I thought *you* were watching them?' and I could do without that drama.
