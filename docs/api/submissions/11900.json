We had both agreed we could invite as many people as we wanted but I did not expect such a number I thought the Christian ceremony might be the larger one and even that would max out at 75 people.

First, having a Christian wedding when you are atheist is kinda an insult to Christian beliefs.

He offered with the provision that it include the Indian ceremony. He has every right to pull that money. \n\nBig fourth,  your family has no right to call and berate FIL.

I have heard of indian wedding being days long and if they have the money for it, just enjoy the celebration and let your fiancee have his dream wedding too.

You are only respecting one of them.  Can you guess which one?", "YTA. There's no reason those who would be 'inconvenienced' need to go to both events. Your FILs are paying? It's their money.

It's obvious you don't love your fiance. He was willing to compromise and include both weddings. Then he was willing to compromise again and reduce the days to just three days... But you're too selfish to realise how much this man loves you. If your friends and family can only make it for a few days then let them come for those few days... This is an important tradition to your Fiance and his family and they included your white wedding as well. To blatantly say let's not do an Indian wedding is a gross disrespect to his traditions.

It seems you're only doing this to fit in with these \"white friends\" and its all for show.

I can\u2019t even imagine how exhausted you would be by the time the second wedding rolled around an entire week later. A 3-day wedding with 200 guests or thereabouts would be the compromise. Possibly spaced out from the Western-style wedding by a week or so? Or I would probably also put the Western-style wedding first if they\u2019re back to back.
