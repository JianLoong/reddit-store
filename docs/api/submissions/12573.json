My ex and I separated 4 months ago and I still struggle. I\u2019ve made my sister aware of this. So she\u2019s staying elsewhere when she comes home. My house my rules. I don\u2019t want to go back down the path I was at for my sake and my kids sake. You\u2019re not the ass.", "NTA Your house--your rules...and not only is she wanting to have it--she is expecting you to provide it.", "Nta.\n at this level of alcoholism she probably can\u2019t go 5 days dry without severe side effects such as DTs and needs to either not come or stay in a hotel", "That sounds like a wide range of drinks and not actually a high alcohol content for an alcoholic.\n\nIs your mom actually an alcoholic (ie dependant on alcohol and will experience shakes/illness if she goes for a certain amount of time without a drink) or is she just someone who drinks a lot but can go days without a drink?\n\n\nIf she\u2019s the former, then she needs to stay in a hotel as going cold Turkey could actually be very dangerous for her\n\nIf the latter, then your house your rules.", "NTA. \nPlease be aware it can be lethal for people with alcohol use disorder to stop drinking cold turkey.", "As another daughter of an alcoholic, NTA. \n\nYou're not telling her she can't drink. She has the option to drink. She can drink elsewhere, stay in a hotel, or not come.", "NTA - Your house, your choice.", "NTA. Your house,. People know you have this boundary so they need to stop telling you what to do.", "NTA. It's a rule in ours too\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. And not uncommon for children of alcoholics. \n\nIf she can\u2019t stop for a few days, she can stay at a hotel.", "NTA. Get her 2 bottles of sparkling cider, a bottle of chocolate milk, and a case of nonalcoholic beer.", "Info:. OP when you say she's alcoholic, is she at the point where not drinking causes her to get the shakes?\n\nIt doesn't change the validity of your rule, but it's worth considering is she's at the point of 'can't stop drinking' or if she's at 'stopping drinking abruptly might trigger other problems' stage. \n\nIf the latter, simply asking her to not drink may be insufficient and you'd be setting yourself up to be especially disappointed, because by that point you visit may turn into a spontaneous and stressful intervention.", "NTA - your house your rules. Plus you state your mother is an alcoholic and yet she thinks it's not fair she has to give up drinking? She has a problem", "NTA\n\nDon't give in!  It sounds like she's the reason you have that rule.", "NTA. I\u2019m curious who has told you to let her. Family members? It sounds to me like your mother needs an intervention, not an allowance to drink in your home.", "NTA, but this entitled witch is. Stick to your rule, and don't be bully. She should feel guilty for being a demanding and rude guest.", "OP is NTA. But it can be very dangerous for alcoholics to just stop drinking all of a sudden. Her mother needs to stay somewhere else.", "That is an enormous amount of alcohol for one person for 5 days. Your house your rules. NTA", "NTA. This is like a \u201chow many things are wrong with this picture\u201d situation. Starting with, even if you WEREN\u2019T an alcohol-free home, even if you were a \u201cLet the liquor flow!\u201d home, it is *incredibly presumptuous* to tell your hosts what types of liquor you expect them to provide for you. That\u2019s before we even get into her failure to abide by your reasonable house rules and her clear addiction issues. I say this as someone who likes a good drink!", "NTA and this! Signed kid of alcoholic", "Bravo/a!", "If she was a meth addict, would she also demand that you have a fresh pipe and a key of Walt & Jesse\u2019s Finest waiting for her? NTA.", "For an alcoholic, it is that hard. It is an insidious disease. And I agree, NTA. If my alcoholic sister was still alive, I would not let her bring alcohol or have it in my house.", "No.   OP is not obligated to find an alcoholic a hotel and stay with them while they drink.  That\u2019s straight-up enabling.", "Yes however, these are the rules and it\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to manage the moms addiction.", "as if anybody wouldnt know shed have a few bottles of something strong in her luggage anyway.........", "Every day that's ABOUT 2 1/2 beers, 2 glasses of wine, and a fifth of a bottle of Baileys. Jesus. And mother didn't say \"I'm bringing that to drink. No, she said she expects that to be there for her. She wants OP to buy that and have it ready for her. What a asshole.", "It really isn't for someone who is an alcoholic. I know people who could put back the beer and the two bottles of wine in a single day and be back for more the next morning.", "I lived with someone who drank that much in a week. She was terrible and emotionally abusive when drunk, which duh, was all the time lmaooo. NTA op!!", "You do realise that whatever rules you have that she accepts, invariably she will break them. NTA.", "For an alcoholic that's actually pretty small amount. Many alcoholics will get though a similar amount of alcohol before breakfast.\n\nI knew a guy who would drink half a liter of vodka in the morning before driving to work and would drink the rest of the bottle over the course of the day.", "Jesus. I can't even imagine. Guess I'm lucky no one in my immediate family drinks that heavily. I had a couple uncles and some even further relatives who were alcoholics but I was either young when they died or we weren't close, so this seemed like a lot to me.", "thats how you know the person you responded to didnt have the \"pleasure\" of having to handle an alcoholic yet \ud83d\ude05", "It's not in my family but the guy I was mentioning with the vodka was actually a pleasure to deal with/be around anything related to alcohol seems to have a range of reactions. I'm not sure anyone in his family even knew he drank. \n\nhe had a pretty good job and if I didn't know the amount he was drinking I would never have known, I never once saw the man appear drunk, slur his speak, stumble etc and was the sort of guy who do anything for anybody.", "Not all alcoholics are raging and mean or problematic.", "Okay, imma need the story behind your username plz", "He's what's called a functional alcoholic. Probably drinks at home all night."]}
