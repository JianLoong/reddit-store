I told her that if she wants to drink but not go out, she can stay at a hotel, but if she wants to stay with us, she will have to abide by the no alcohol in the house rule. \n\nShe said that it isn't fair to her that she \"has to give up drinking\" for the time she's here, and I said she doesn't have to, she just can't do it in my house. My husband is on my side, but a few people have told me to \"relax and just let her drink in the house\" because it's \"only for a few days\".\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Since I've gotten this a lot, I'll make it clear here. My mother is not at the point where if she doesn't drink, she'll get sick or suffer massive withdrawals. The withdrawals aren't the issue in this situation, it's when she's drunk is the problem. She sees this as a vacation instead of meeting her son in law for the first time or seeing her daughter for the first time in over 4 years (we live 3600 kms [2237 miles] apart and my husband and I eloped).\n\nShe is the main reason I don't keep alcohol in my house, but that's not to say I don't drink, I do, but not for no reason, if I'm going to drink, it will be outside of my home, either at a friend's house, the bar or anything along those lines.
