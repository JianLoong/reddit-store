It must be super difficult to see her in this situation, but as long as you provide financial support she has no reason to change her situation.", "NTA - you need to draw a FIRM boundary regarding paying for your immediate family only.  If your SIL wants to keep getting pregnant, then the kids sperm donor can work a full time job to pay for them.", "NTA. The thing is, you created expectations on their part when you paid before. They ASSumed that you'd shell out the money like you've done in the past. That is on them.", "NTA.  If the husbands and his family are upset, they can open their wallets and shut their mouths.   \n\n\nFrankly, you're a better person than me, I wouldn't have paid for any of the expenses for any of the children.", "NTA no one is entitled to your money but you done it to yourself in all honesty. \n\nStop supporting them. If they struggle that\u2019s their own faults because there\u2019s 2 adults in that home. \n\nAlso tell his family to pay the damn bill before they even comment on you.", "NTA\n\nThe level of entitlement your wife\u2019s sister/husband\u2019s family have is staggering. \n\nYou went so far above and beyond what anyone could possibly expect, and they are so ungrateful! \n\nThe set of expenses for baby 1 were a surprise, and she should have counted her lucky stars and made sure she could provide for her own care after that. Paying for baby 2 is more than any reasonable person would or should accept, but the fact that they expected it is troubling. Then the expectations for baby 3 are just infuriating. I would never give them another penny.", "You are obviously NTA. \n\nStop supporting this lazy couple that doesn\u2019t know how to use protection or practice family planning. Choices have consequences, it\u2019s time they dealt with the consequences of their very poor choices. You have been overly kind to them in the past, it\u2019s time to step back and let them step up. \n\nAll that money should\u2019ve been spent on you and your family yet you let it go to SIL\u2019s family, it\u2019s time that stops.", "NTA and you should have stopped this after hubby got out of the slammer.  Now they feel entitled to you to support them.\n\nNo more money until they pay you back what they owe you (which will never happen).    Never ever \"load\" them money ever again.  And never loan money to anyone without an agreement for repayment with interest and deadlines.\n\nCut them off now and end the money train.  They need to grow up and figure up how to deal with the consequences of their poor habits.   You need to get your wife onboard with this too or else.", "NTA But you and your wife need to sit down and have a discussion about no longer helping her sister financially. Even with big presents like this.\n\nThe kids when they get older enough get birthday and holiday presents but the two of you need to focus on your family and covering your expenses.\n\nThere are ways you can help people that aren't financial. By all means do that. But don't be their piggy bank. And if the only help they want from you is financially, you may need to be prepared to be there for your spouse when her sister is (1) mad at her and (2) pulls away from her.", "NTA imo you should've stopped financially helping when she got pregnant the second time.

It is not right for them to keep having children when they can\u2019t even afford 1! Good on you for putting your foot down.", "NTA - They expect you to fund their lifestyle. You did for quite some times and have the right to declines. Of course they will drag your name through the mud; so what. \n\nAt no point did they express gratitude for your support.

Pay up or shut up", "You shouldn't be paying bills for someone who is perfectly capable of earning their own money and taking care of themselves. \n\nIt seems you've been very generous already, far beyond any reasonable expectation they might have had. On top of all this, you didn't ever agree to pay the hospital bill. Their entitlement is truly shocking - I recommend you stop enabling their poor choices and start focusing on your own family.\n\nIf his family members are so upset that he has to pay his own bills, perhaps they should step up to take care of the bills themselves?\n\nNTA, definitely.", "You should claim them as dependents then since your paying for their births. NTA!\n\nWho do these people think they are?!", "It confuses me you would even ask this question. It has a hint of martyrdom in that you have really over extended a very unhealthy codependency and that helps no one. I have to imagine something else is going on here. Is this family religious? Is there some sort of concern that she may take her health care into her own hands and everybody\u2019s trying to keep her from doing that? I don\u2019t understand how this is being turned on you in the least, nor do I understand why you financed them at all ever really.

Set boundaries.", "Y.T.A. only in the sense that you allowed this to go as far as it has. Clearly your own family would have made better use of the resources. Here's the thing... you can't reason with unreasonable. So you just say, \"no\".
