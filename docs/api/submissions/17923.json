Apparently his entire family are losers, not just him, because they all seem to think it's your responsibility to pay for this stuff over and over, just because you did it the first 2 times.

Make sure SIL and hubby know that preventing another pregnancy is all on them, and if they don't start using some sort of protection they'll have way more mouths to feed than they can afford instead of just the 3, which I'm sure already places a burden on their meager finances. _**If you can't do the time, don't do the crime**_.\n\n5.
