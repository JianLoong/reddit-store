Apparently his entire family are losers, not just him, because they all seem to think it's your responsibility to pay for this stuff over and over, just because you did it the first 2 times.

Their addictions and inability to support themselves is not your responsibility. Period. You also need to start couples therapy to deal with this. \n\nTheir perception that they are entitled to YOUR income needs to be ended immediately. And your wife needs to agree and have that conversation with them. Their poor life choices aren\u2019t her responsibility. If she really wants to support them she can get a job.", "NTA but honestly your wife is for prioritising her birth family over her forever family. Take care and all the best.", "NTA. Offer to pay for a vasectomy for your SILs husband.", "NTA for refusing to pay. YTA for enabling this behavior. You should have stopped contributing when she got pregnant a second time.", "OP, it's time to drop them as family. They only see you as a bank account. \nNTA for not paying. \nBut, if jeep keep on giving them money, as a gift or otherwise, YTA. They are just doing what they always do, get pregnant, and have you foot the bill. You should've stopped supporting your SIL after the first pregnancy. \nTake care of YOUR family, because your SIL and her family, won't be there for you.", "Ntah you didn\u2019t knock her up. Sounds like you should raise the kid so the deadbeat doesn\u2019t spoil anymore youth of the future", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA.  You\u2019ve been more than generous up to this point.  Looks like SIL doesn\u2019t take better precautions because she thinks you\u2019ll take care of it.", "No. as a matter of fact it sounds like she got pregnant at least the third time for your money. Not to mention if the husbands family is \u201cso appalled\u201d they can pay for it themselves\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f NTA", "No explanation needed, there shouldn't be anything but NTA comments on this one.\n\nNTA", "NTA,but holy shit check out Mr. Moneybags over here! You didn't even get to have the fun of making all these kids but you still took the responsibility? The f, dude. No wonder you're seen as a living ATM. Sometimes those are out of order,hint hint.", "Wow\u2026.I\u2019m at a loss for words after reading this post. \n\nYou do realize you have been supporting two families for quite some time, don\u2019t you? \n\nNTA, please tell me that you know this!!", "NTA. Serial impregnation is their way of taking your money.", ">the sister's husband (38M) and his family looked at me when the bill arrived. I remained silent, and he handed me the bill\n\nYou have conditioned your sister and your husband to depend on you for handouts. You need to stop doing so.\n\nThere is only one outcome when you give people money: they will ask you for more. And more. And more. It is impossible for someone to stop asking for money once they know that the only thing standing between them and a few hundred/thousand dollars of 'free money' is taking the time and trouble to ask you for that 'free money'.\n\nNTA", "NTA they should stop reproducing if they can\u2019t afford it jesus f*** they should\u2019ve never had the first one", "NTA.  Go no contact with them and send them a box of condoms.  You did not screw her, let the father be responsible for his own family.  If his family members are so upset they should step up and pay their bills, you are tired of being the family bank", "NTA sweet cheese why are people like this", "NTA. I wouldn't have paid for the first one.", "NTA. But you shouldn\u2019t have paid even the first time to begin with.", "NtA\n\nSorry but your wife has got to step in here and manage her family. Unless she also thinks you should pay, she should be the one telling her fam that they need to deal with their own shit.", "NTA in any way. Wow, you have been generous enough and beyond.\n\nSomeone help these people get birth control. Snip him.", "NTA. You've been nothing but a wallet to them. Your wife should have put an end to this expectation two pregnancies ago. You should have put an end to it yourself after she got pregnant the second time.", "NTA.  She's chosen to have three babies she can't afford.  Maybe you should draw up your own bill for unpaid loans and answer with that.", "NTA.", "YTA here because you have taught them to rely on you. I cannot believe how many times you continuously opened up your wallet for three whole pregnancies without saying one word about any boundaries or expectations. Now you seem shocked that they expected you to pay this bill when you have been doing so all along. Grow a backbone.", "NTA: Stop giving her money. She's not your charity case and she needs to stop having children she can't afford.", "NTA\n\nWhere does your wife stand in all of this?  Does she feel you should continue to subsidize her sister and family?\n\nYou were extremely generous in the past.\n\nYou are unable to do so now.\n\nIf the future, any monetary amounts given to these people should be nominal.  You are not responsible for their family.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA.\n\nWhy would you pay for the birth of a child that isn't yours? That blows my mind.\n\nAlso, if your wife wants to support her parents/siblings why isn't she working?", "NTA.  Take NONE of this into your heart, mind, or pocketbook.", "It's not even his sister. It's his wife's older sister.", "Uh", "This is the thing, not only did SIL make a poor choice in partner but OP and wife made a poor choice to keep giving money without setting boundaries or expectations.\n\nClear to me OP NTA as they aren\u2019t entitled to money from you, but equally you have played a role in creating this situation as you didn\u2019t firmly set expectations", "Better yet he could offer to do it in his garage with the tools he already has!", "And, handing the money directly to the dr.", "u/PrudentTemporary261 is a bot.", "No good deed goes unpunished.", "Is it not \"leech\"? \n\nBut yes, you're correct otherwise.", "Why not both!?\nNTA", "Both, to be safe", "Lololol.  I like it", "Why not both. To be extra safe. Both of them are not able to be trusted", "I have a feeling part of this is cultural, so you're better off talking to people from your specific culture to help.\n\nYes, in a lot of Asian cultures for instance it's expected kids look after parents, but parents are not supposed to be running heavy gambling addictions. It's also expected grandparents provide free childcare and a bunch of other stuff, so if they're just mooching off you and gambling away their money they are the ones that really should be feeling the shame.\n\nI think you need to get that advice first from people who your wife might believe and who can give you the tools to fight this. Then try to get on the same page as yoru wife about what you will and will not contribute.", "Here is a solution to consider. Start a budget. Have an account for household expenses, have an account for your children's education, have an account for your retirement.  Now what is leftover after you put money from each paycheck into these accounts?? What ever is leftover from paying into these accounts gets divided equally between you and your wife. She now can decide how much she wants to keep of her money, and how much to give to her favorite charity.  When her family comes begging, refer them to your wife.", "Out of curiosity, where do you live?"]}
