Apparently his entire family are losers, not just him, because they all seem to think it's your responsibility to pay for this stuff over and over, just because you did it the first 2 times.

I would have been out as soon as her husband came back.", "Fuck. That. Shit. NTA.\n\nCall him out; he's a deadbeat husband.", "NTA. But you have to stop funding her poor choices. If they can\u2019t afford kids they shouldn\u2019t have them. Cut them off financially and let them sink or swim on their own", "NTA. Offer to pay for her birth control or sterilization. If you want to help in the future, never give them money. Pay a months rent. Gift card for a grocery store. It can still be used irresponsibly.", "NTA. How on *earth* is this couple\u2019s apparently insatiable need to procreate *your* financial responsibility? It boggles my mind.", "Absolutely NTA. I honestly cannot believe you lasted as long as you did! I think it is time to start putting healthy boundaries in place. Realize that may mean you lose some people along the way but honestly that's ok, this is 2023 just because they're \"family\" does mean you are obligated to them. Think about what a healthy life looks like for you and your family.", "Lol what is this, you are not the asshole you are a low-key saint...and somehow after trying to a ridiculous extend they managed to get you pissed", "NTA at all. \n\nWhat state are you in? It's possible they qualify for Medicaid.", "NTA. But this issue is between you and your wife. You need to come to an agreement with her about what kind and how much assistance if any you provide her sister.", "The only thing you\u2019re an AH about is you paid the first two hospital bills, but then did not bother to tell them you were not going to pay the third\u2026 You really should\u2019ve given them a heads up during the third pregnancy. You already paid twice, so of course they were expecting you to pay the third one.", "I have a very similar story. You are not the AH", "NTA you've been exploited enough OP. Time for you and your wife to grow a spine and use it!", "You know you\u2019re NTA. Everyone knows it. Even BIL knows. That\u2019s the thing about AHs, they claim everyone else while sitting on their throne of lies.", "Omg wtf. Of course NTA", "You\u2019re being used and abused.. it\u2019s time to cut off the leeches and NEVER give them a penny again", "NTA\n\nSounds like he\u2019s from a family of grifters.\n\nYou\u2019ve already been incredibly generous; but past generosity does not create a future obligation.", "NTA if you can't feed em, don't breed em.", "Nta unless you knocked your sil up, time to close the wallet.", "NTA your first mistake was to help them at all. Once you do it once it becomes an obligation in there eyes and if you don't in their eyes you are a bad person. Don't do favors to people who don't accept the consequences of their actions because you become an enabler.", "NTA \nMy god I'd have said a whole lot more than that!  \n\nLike, you're not giving any more handouts just because he can't pull out :)", "NTA.\nNo good turn goes unpunished as it were.\nDo not be guilted into giving any more as your family is being used.", "NTA screw up once I\u2019ll help, make the same bad decision THREE times and you\u2019re on your own. Though after the second one you should have told her that if she chooses to let a deadbeat get her pregnant again then she is on her own.", "NTA\n\nTime for the dad to pay for his own kids.", "NTA but you set yourself up to be their bank. You\u2019ve enabled their behavior. Stop all payments to them.", "Why the fuck did you keep helping? Jesus Christ.\n\nNTA though.", "NTA, you need to change the perspective of your own financial situation. Define your financial goals and pay yourself first. Retirement goals, kids college, down payment on a house, savings goals. All that goes into a separate account designed for your future that is off limits. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nThen pay your bills and the extra goes into a general savings account. This is your available funds for emergencies, gift, entertainment, vacation, and family help.\n\nNow you can point to your general savings and tell your wife that you cannot afford it. Because that other money is clearly designed for your future.", "Esh You aren\u2019t responsible for their poor choices and yta for enabling them both this long. Maybe you should have offered money for a vasectomy.", "Do not ever give them another penny. Gifts for the kids, preferably in the form of college accounts their parents can\u2019t touch. But never give them another dime. The fact he handed you the bill really gets to me. NTA, but you would be if ever gave the parents another red cent", "I don't understand, you give them money and money, and the problem is you don't give them more money? What greed does to people. NTA", "nta, stop paying for them.", "NTA and I strongly suggest you and your wife sit down and discuss setting strict boundaries and maybe going low contact based on this repetitive and abusive behavior on the SIL and BIL part. I have serious concerns for their current children and if you suspect misconduct or mistreatment that you contact the authorities about child endangerment. They are leeches on you and your family and those poor kids suffer as well.", "Nta. So does this sil husband expect you to pay for these kids growing up and their college funds too? I feel bad but seriously keep having kids they can\u2019t take care of!", "Tell her the only hospital bill you will pay going forward will be one for her to get sterilized. If you keep paying their bills they will never stop having kids they can't afford.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut you need to go no contact", "NTA \n\nDo not give them any more money!", "NTA. Tell them you only pay for babies that you helped make.  Stop giving them any money. They won\u2019t learn from their mistakes if you keep bailing them out.", "NTA and anyone who wants to give you shit about it you tell them \"I see you feel strongly about this. I'll let SIL know that you're willing to cover her expenses since I'm not able to\"", "NTA\nIf you want to help her, buy her a giant box of condoms.  She can\u2019t afford her litter as it is.", "NTA and they're using you for their money", "Buy them a box of condoms. \n\nNTA", "NTA cut them off financially, they are using you and your wife and you need to stop it. You\u2019re rewarding bad behaviour.", "NTA\n\nBut please stop supporting your SIL's bad decisions.", "NTA. On what grounds does he expect you to support his family?", "NTA and don\u2019t be foolish coming in here asking this. \nKick those scrubs to the curb. Any of their family gives you any gruff show them how much money you\u2019ve given them. Glad you finally stopped enabling them.", "Why should you have to pay for your SIL letting someone cum inside her. That's her problem, not yours or your wifes problem.", "You set a horrible precedent. I thought boundaries would be up on the second child. It will be harder and more pressure now but set those up now else you\u2019ll end up supporting them indefinitely. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t make you an AH though, so go talk to your wife and you might want to go LC with the family for a while. NTA", "Right? This has to be the clearest open and shut case I\u2019ve ever seen on this sub. NTA", "My sis in law\u2019s family is like this. Sadly, some people are so damn entitled and take advantage of someone\u2019s kindness.", "If he didn\u2019t pay for the first 2 maybe there wouldn\u2019t be a 3rd? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s OPs fault, just that the pattern of the past sure as hell isn\u2019t working. STOP paying for _anything_ - nothing at all. \u201cWe have our own financial challenges, we cannot spare any cash at all for the foreseeable future.\u201d When the pushback comes, \u201cgiving you substantial money in the past has depleted any extra funds, the well is dry here and that\u2019s not changing anytime soon. You should plan accordingly\u201d.\nI\u2019m not one to sling around \u201cgo NC\u201d but for the love of all that is holy - I\u2019d suggest it here.", "Your wife needs to get a job. These are not normal unforeseen responsibilities of marriage. I have not paid for anything for my nephews other than birthday/Christmas gifts, occasional meals such as food if they come over to my house for dinner. I do not financially support any adults. Your wife and her family are taking advantage of you", "You weren't warned because it's BS! These are not \"responsibilities that come with marriage\", they're just taking advantage of you.", "Just the fact you are asking  AITA in this situation makes it seem made up,  there is no grey area, tell them to do one. There is no expectation to financially support them, now they have been abusive over it it's got to be over.", "Marriage doesn\u2019t entail that. You\u2019re doing it because she\u2019s making you believe that you have to, to be married to her. If that\u2019s the case, then, BYE, WIFE! She should be livid FOR you! \u2026 and her parents are in their 60s. They can work and earn their own money, still. They\u2019re not and should never be your forced burden. Your wife and her family are a clan of leeches.", "nailed it", "most definitely.  as its been said before, \"No\" is a complete sentnece", "You have to learn to say \"no\". Stop giving your in laws money.", "You need to take care of yourself and your child. If higher education is expensive where you live you need to save for your kid's education and you need to save for your retirement!  \nIf your wife disapproves she can leave and get herself a job to support her deadbeat relatives. You need to do right by you and your kid first and foremost.", "OP please get thee to therapy.  You'd be surprised what the right therapist can do for you?  Its also very shitty that your wife expects you to support her family financially with apparently no end in sight then guilts you and calls you selfish if you put up a boundary.  She's showing who has your back and it ain't her.\n\nTherapy dude.....all the therapy.", "Does your wife not understand that you won't be able to enjoy life as you currently do if you start financially supporting her entire family?", "If your wife wants to help her deadbeat families she should just get her own job and hand her paycheck right over to them. She has no right to make you feel bad about not giving them any more of your hard-earned money. That money is for your wife and child, not your wife, child and any loser with their hand out."]}
