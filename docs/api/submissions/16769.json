A man in his sixties strikes up a conversation with a girl sitting near me. I learned from their conversation that she was in eighth grade. \n\nThis girl was initially wearing over-ear headphones and studying. He sits across from her at an acceptable distance. His first comment was that she was \"rare\" for being a lefty, with \\[certain color\\] eyes and \\[certain color\\] hair. He says he had the same color hair as a kid. He then asks if he was being creepy, in a sort of light-hearted way. He attempted to justify the interaction by saying that he used to be a teacher and that he was the best teacher in the state at one point. The girl politely said he was not creepy. \n\nThe man continues to ask about the girl's interests and he tells related stories about his own life. \n\nThe man asks where the kid goes to school and what grade she was in. The girl responds. The man says that he knows people at that school. At some point, the man again asks if he was being creepy.\n\nBy this point, I felt that the man was establishing a rapport with the girl; I was skeptical of his attempts to relate to her interests. I was skeptical of the way he tried to address the idea that he was creepy (by the end of the conversation, he brought up his own creepiness three times). I was skeptical of his inquiries. \n\nI was concerned for the comfort and safety of the girl who was communicating information about her school and her age. She was young and seemed timid \u2013 not responding much & just trying to be nice. \n\nEventually I couldn't help but interrupted him: \"Frankly, I think she is trying to study right now.\"\n\nHe responded: \"I can help her study\"\n\nI responded: \"She doesn't need your help\"\n\nHe said, with a slightly upset voice: \"How do you know?\"\n\nI replied: \"I'm just letting you know\" and looked away, indicating that I would not argue. \n\nThe girl made no comment. The man went to a different table and the girl left the coffee shop after a few minutes. Then, I heard the man crying. At this point, I was very stressed and I left.\n\nEssentially, I worry most that I made the situation worse for everyone. I also cant help but feel guilty after the man cried. But still, I really was concerned for the girl. Am I the asshole for getting involved in this way? Was my concern reasonable?", "created_utc": 1683602489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cdxns/aita_for_speaking_up_when_i_thought_a_man_was/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are strangers and interactions with strangers need to be light but he was putting way too much importance on it, in some way. NTA you did the right thing here.", "NTA. Only creepy people ask if they're being creepy.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s professionally investigated lots of creeps and has ensured they stay in jail/prison, I\u2019m happy to see you went with your gut. You were well within your rights to stand up in the situation.\n\nThe older man didn\u2019t break any laws, at least by what I\u2019m reading. However, something didn\u2019t feel right about it to you. It\u2019s not uncommon for older people, especially those who have been teachers, to truly desire connection with students. His unsolicited offer to help her study is something that triggered a gut response in you, and I\u2019m glad you followed it. I\u2019m also struck by the man\u2019s comments saying \u201cI\u2019m not a creep.\u201d Well intentioned people rarely have to qualify their actions. Especially for a second time.\n\nLet\u2019s say the girl was with her parents or other suitable adult guardians (not 14 year olds): in that case, I\u2019d say there\u2019s less cause for alarm. \n\nThe man displayed ***possible*** grooming behavior. Bravo for noticing. You may or may not have saved a life, but you were definitely doing what you could to protect the vulnerable. For that, I commend you.", "Come on, you know this was creepy as fuck. He interrupted her with headphones on, talked first about her physical attributes and the proceeded to get ever more personal with his questions. He even asked here where she went to school, which would make it convenient the next time he has a poke full of candy and no one to eat it. All the asking if he was being creepy was his way of figuring out if the girl had the ability to say no to him and he was damn sure liking the fact that she didn't.\n\nGuess what, she ran the first damn opportunity she got.\n\nHe should be crying. He was probably embarrassed and disappointed that he didn't get an opportunity to walk her home, or drive her home in he pdeo van. \n\nYou were NTA. Do this every single time. No joke, you might have saved this kid from a world of hurt.", "NTA in any way. Ignore his crying.   \nHe was being a straight up creep.\n\nA *teacher* would *fucking know better*.  \nI'm not saying he wasn't.   \nI'm saying even if he were that's even *more* reason to find his behavior suspicious.  \n\nEven just striking up a conversation woth someone wearing headphones is prime ah behavior.", "NTA. \n\nWorst case scenario: man was innocent and genuinely wanted to help. Could\u2019ve lost a grandchild or something and you made him sad. He will be fine. \n\nBest case scenario: you saved a young child from being preyed on by an old man. Potentially avoiding a life full of trauma for the kid.", "NTA You were concerned for a very young lady's safety. You spoke up and gave her an opportunity to get away from the creep. If you hadn't spoke up things could have ended differently and in not in a good way.", "I would say NTA. Anyone who asks if they are being creepy, knows they are being creepy! \n\nI prob would've said \"Frankly, you are being creepy,\" but your line worked just as well. Having headphones on is generally considered to mean \"Please don't talk to me.\"\n\nNot your fault the man ended up crying over his creepy behavior.", "NTA He may go in there often and you blew his cover that's why he cried to them. \nYou can go on the website that shows all the sex offenders in whatever area.", "NTA You did the right thing.", "NTA. \n\nThat being said, I'd tend to lean towards maybe leaving a bit more room for the girl to assert her desires next time rather than asserting them for her, especially because if you're right and she is quite timid and non confrontational, she may have been unwilling to say something even if she did want him there given that you were asserting that she didn't and she may have felt like saying she did would upset you or cause a confrontation\n\nStill, you're definitely not the asshole here, you were concerned and helped out, there's nothing wrong with that", "NTA\n\nYou have to go with your gut on these sort of things, this is one of those you had to be there moments. \n\nBut the bigger issue is what is an 8th grader doing in a coffee shop alone? Where is the adult supervision? Yes, an 8th grader can be home alone as they can look after themselves but they still need adult supervision in public, namely for their own protection. At a public library would be fine, I used to spend hours studying/reading at the public library as a youth  but the librarians would kind of keep a close eye on me, they would keep the creepers away.", "Good for you for involving yourself. She's probably really grateful to you since she tried to get him to stop talking to her & he was extremely creepy. I just wish you had stopped her before she gave out her personal details. I would've called in a police report. NTA he cried cuz he knows he was wrong. And cuz he got caught & publically called out being a creeper.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What's he getting out of that conversation? What's the goal there?
