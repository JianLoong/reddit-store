{"id": 1128, "submission_id": "yly8tx", "title": "AITAH for telling my boyfriend he can make his own food?", "selftext": "I (25F) am a stay at home to 3 kids a 7 year old, 3 year old and 11 week old. My boyfriend (26M) works 8 hour days as the manager of a Grain Elevator. Our baby is currently teething and up majority of the night so I am awake with her. Our oldest goes to school at 8:00am so we are awake around 7:30. I am in charge of getting up and getting him ready to go to school every morning. Even the weeks my boyfriend doesn\u2019t go to work until 11:40am. I usually get around 4 hours of sleep. Throughout the day I consider myself to be pretty busy I am making sure the house is clean, doing laundry, taking garbage out, running errands, making lunch for school, doing homework, washing dishes, exclusively pumping on top of taking care of the kids. Keeping the house clean with a very hyper 3 year old is not a very easy task. When my son gets home from school we usually do an easy quick dinner that the kids will eat (the oldest eats very limited foods.) I mainly just snack throughout the day or eat kid scraps. My boyfriend is usually home around 8:30pm and he expects dinner. Majority of the time I have not made anything so I let him know I already fed the kids. When this happens he gets upset. He says things like \u201cmaking food for you and the boys and not spending the tiniest bit of effort to make any for me sounds like you don\u2019t give two fucks about me.\u201d Or he will use it against me in an argument and say he never comes home to any food. He also just goes to sleep immediately after he gets home if I haven\u2019t cooked. Is it wrong for me to not have a meal made for him when he comes home from work? I understand he works hard and provides most of the income (I bring in some money every month, enough to cover most of our bills) so he may want to come home to food instead of making something for himself. On the other hand I feel like he doesn\u2019t understand that I am tired or have been busy and don\u2019t really want to make another separate meal if the kids are fed. There has been times I have made big dinners just for him to tell me he already ate at work. I am more annoyed lately at little things like him leaving dirty laundry all over the house, leaving his dishes around the house or in the sink and not in the dishwasher. I might be more inclined to make him separate food for when he gets home if I wasn\u2019t constantly cleaning up after him as well as the kids. \nSo am I wrong for telling him he can make his own food?", "created_utc": 1667566379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yly8tx/aitah_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_can_make_his/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
