They were still finishing high school, and the whole thing was very overwhelming for them, they obviously weren't planning on a kid. They tried, but they both have some mental health struggles (the SO from birth, my sister from PPD and of course the stress for both of them) and they just couldn't give her what she needed.\n\nThey decided about six months after she was born to give her up for adoption. Our parents wouldn't take her, so my now husband and I stepped up. We wanted kids anyway, and I hated the thought of losing my niece, so we offered and they accepted. We also offered to make it temporary while they went to school and got sorted, but they said no, they were not confidant in their ability to be parents, and signed their rights away. The process was official, and essentially our daughter legally is no different than any other adopted child, she's ours.\n\nMy sister doing this burned a lot of bridges in the family, which I didn't want. Our parents and the extended family basically disowned her for abandoning her daughter, we're very LC with them as a result. My sister and her SO are still involved in our daughters life, she sees them as aunt and uncle, though we are planning on telling her everything as she grows up.\n\nThe two of them really did turn their lives around in the past three years. My sister graduates this year, and he managed to find a trade job that pays well. We were glad, but we weren't expecting them to ask what they did next. They invited us over for dinner, and basically admitted to regretting giving up their kid more than anything. They wanted to start the process of giving them custody back.\n\nI immediately told them that wasn't happening. It's not that they don't have the means now, it's that emotionally they aren't her parents, my husband and I are. She wouldn't be exited to be back with her parents, she'd be wondering why we dumped her to her aunt and uncle. I told her that, if by some chance in ten years she decides to live with them, we'll allow that, but we don't expect that to happen.\n\nShe got upset, and said we were being cruel, and accused us of being petty and vengeful. Here's where I might've gone too far, I told her if she doesn't agree to drop this now and forever, she won't get to visit anymore. Basically she can either be an aunt or nothing, her call. She gave me such a hateful look, but agreed, and the two of them left.\n\nSince then she still comes by to visit her niece, but basically pretends I don't exist. I don't regret our decision, it's just maybe I came on too strong, and needlessly ruined my relationship with my sister.", "created_utc": 1683985076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ghu1a/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_shell_never_get/", "score": 480, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep the visits supervised. You told them if your daughter chose you'd let her go to them. Don't think for a minute she's not going to play mind games with your daughter to have her choose them.\n\nYou gave them the opportunity to make it temporary. They said no. You allow them to be in the child's life. It's a tough thing to watch your biological child raised by another person, but it's the child's best interests that matter, not your sister's feelings. If she really cared about the child she'd know how much it would mess her up to 'switch mommies'.", "You stepped forward with a major lifelong commitment to family, offered them the opportunity to eventually reverse it - which they declined - and provide a loving home to a child.  \n\nFurthermore, it can be emotionally confusing to a child to be exposed to such family conflict. If it is in your power to keep that conflict from them, that is not asshole behavior, it's good parenting.    For all these things:   \n\n\nNTA  \n\n\nYes, you may have ruined your relationship with your sister.  However, I look at that word \"needlessly\" askance - you did it, I suggest, because you have made a lifelong commitment to your child, your child's well being depends in part on that commitment, and your sisters'  variable behavior toward the child could cause trauma - which you are protecting the child from.   That's self-sacrifice.  So much NTA.", "NTA. You stepped up and took your niece in when no one else would. They signed over their parental rights, aka, they have no right to take the child back. She is legally your child. \n\nKudos to you for maintaining the bond between the child and her bio parents. That is very healthy for the child, despite the hiccups that may occur. \n\nTo remove her from you would only traumatize her further and your sister needs to understand that. You are her mother. She would be very confused, afraid and probably angry to be uprooted from the only home she knows. Your sister and her SO are hurting, and now that they are doing better they are realizing what they\u2019ve lost. \n\nYou made the right decision. Continue to encourage your sister to see her, but she must respect the boundaries SHE ultimately created. Like it was previously mentioned, when your daughter is old enough to decide for herself, let her choose who she wants to be with. \n\nYou clearly love your sister and your daughter.

Imagine if she had given her up for adoption to another family- do you think they would give her back? Not a chance. You are her parents and that\u2019s all she knows it would be traumatic for her to be taken away from you! Can\u2019t your sister just babysit more and get to know her (with boundaries of course) instead of trying to take her away from her parents?", "NTA\n\nYou needed to nip this in the bud. Kids aren't convenient accessories for the adults around them. Their developmental needs for attachment and consistency should be the top priority over the regrets of people who gave them up.\n\nYour sister even asking this question tells me she isn't ready to be a parent for your daughter, because she's thinking of what she wants and seems completely oblivious to the damage such a switch at this age would do.\n\nProtect your daughter, and if your sister has access to your house, you may want to make sure you have cameras and record any future evidence of arguments over this + don't leave her alone with your daughter if you can avoid it.", "NTA. she's been your daughter for 2 and 1/2 years. They gave up their rights.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is thinking about herself and her wants/needs/regrets. \nYou are thinking about a 3 year old child's well-being.\nThey are very different things.", "Clearly your sister hasn't grown up enough to realise and understand what this all means and how this will effect the child\nTo just ignore you like you don't exist shows how childish she is.

Toxic energy around kids isn't needed.\n\nNta", "NTA - you are looking out for your kid.", "NTA and most of the other adults in your family are, not for being unable to care for the kid but for stigmatizing your sister and making drama over the adoption to the point where you had to go LC. Your sister is behaving cluelessly if she thinks she can just rip the kid away after years of you raising her as parents. Your daughter is going to see right through this because kids are smart and perceptive.", "NTA but realistically I don't know how you navigate the reality of your sister being the biological mother of your adopted daughter.\n\nAs you point out, at some point your daughter is going to know the truth and it might well end up with your bio daughter resenting you for keeping her from her \\*real\\* parents even though your intentions were good.\n\nI think consulting now with a very skilled child psychologist in order to figure out the best way to handle the situation in terms of the needs of the child and not either of the adults. I understand why adoption by a close family member seems to make a lot of emotional sense in the moment but it is not without its risks as well since the close relative is going to normally be in the picture and even with an \"open adoption\" with a stranger there isn't the situation of there being the kind of interaction that occurs within most families as the non-related bio parent isn't going to around constantly", "Info: Was your sister receiving any treatment for her PPD? Did your sister have a lawyer that was advising her along the way during the adoption process?", "NTA\n\nShe is your child and they gave up all rights. That being said, I do think some things were said that should probably be walked back, on both sides. There's resentment from your sister's view now and that never leads to anything good. You both need to heal that somehow, before your daughter is old enough to learn what's happened.", "NTA. You were protecting your daugher from people suggesting they want to take her away. They might think they are fixing their past mistake, but they are actually making the same mistake a second time. They are putting their needs above their childs and making a big decision.\n\nI think it might be a good idea if you tell your child sooner rather than later though. You do not want her to hear from your sister.", "NAH but maybe talk this out with r/adoption and get some adoptee perspectives on the best ways to navigate this relationship and remember, your sister and her SO didn't stop loving her when they signed those papers.", "NTA. Can you imagine asking this if she weren\u2019t your sister? While it\u2019s okay for anyone to feel their feelings and have regrets, because we\u2019re human, her expectation is unreasonable/unrealistic. You legally adopted the child. Full stop.", "ESH. Don't wait to tell your daughter that she's adopted and her aunt and uncle are her bio parents. It's really really important to do that as early as possible for her mental health.", "NTA and a little N A H: But I would ask you sister to have a sit down and apologize for how you came off. Explain that while you can\u2019t change the custody agreement both for your daughter\u2019s sake and your sake, the intensity of how you responded was due to panic. And maybe consider doing the following\n\n1. Being a mom to a child for 2-3 years results in a super strong attachment for both. Changing custody would be damaging to both of you.\n\n2. (Think about this carefully before hand) but maybe discuss with your sister a timeline of when you can start to explain to your daughter her birth\n\nWhile you are NTA the goal should be to work through the upset that was caused and repair your relationship.

This is not healthy for your kid.", "They invited you over for dinner, and then the two of them left?", "NAH. Many, many birth parents regret their decision to relinquish a child (definitely not all though) and I'm sure it's painful for your sister. But you did give them the chance that they didn't take and you're not wrong for holding them to it after parenting for so long.\n\nI would strongly suggest that you talk to an adoption centered child therapist, preferably with your sister. The 4 of you can work out the best way to move forward in a way that is good for your daughter.\n\nSince this was a family adoption I'm guessing that you didn't get the sort of pre adoption education that most APs get. You really need to already be telling your daughter her birth story in an age appropriate way. I know you plan to talk to her about it when she's older but it is important for her to always have known her origins to minimize the trauma that it can cause.", "What you said was harsh, but we\u2019re all capable of that sometimes. No assholes here,  just people that are hurting.", "I have to say NAH. Your sister made a decision while she was roughly 18 and suffering from PPD; I can't call her an AH for now regretting this.", "There\u2019s almost no way for this to end well. Not as is. Legally, you are right. Morally\u2026 no 18yo is going to be able to make a \u201cforever\u201d decision like that will full knowledge. It\u2019s hard to make a judgement here.\n\nThink you guys can do, essentially, group therapy and learn how to co-parent? I know of a setup which essentially has all the people living together and the kid has more than two parents and they actively work with each other and a therapist to make it work. \n\nSeems a high bar to reach, but I\u2019m feeling relentlessly optimistic this morning.", "NAH. It sounds like the four of you have a good relationship. Enough so that you went LC with the rest of your family to stay close to your sister.\n\nYour sister and her boyfriend were young when they made the decision to give up their daughter. Now that they are a bit more settled in their adulthood, they are feeling regret. It's very normal. They can see the life they could've given their daughter if they had her now. \n\nIt must be very hard for them but that doesn't mean you have to give your daughter to them. Three years is a lot of time to bond and you're right your daughter will be confused.\n\nI agree with the other commenter that suggested group therapy. Because of your otherwise good relationship, it seems like something very beautiful and healing can come from this.", "NTA- This isn't an easy situation but sending a three year old to live with people she doesn't know as her parents is not a good plan. I'd let her know as soon as she's old enough.", "NTA. You are the only parents your daughter has ever known and are looking out for her the best you can. I get the feeling, though, that your sister and her partner are just thinking of their needs and not of their daughter\u2019s. And what is best for the daughter *has* to come first. \n\nIf they were thinking of your daughter first, they could of done something similar to what you suggested - wait, be patient, develop their relationship with the girl, and see what she wants in the future. But you can\u2019t just take a child from the only parents she has known because it is convenient for you now.", "Info, when your sister was planning on the adoption was she looking for a closed adoption with strangers? Did you convince her to let family take the child or was that what they wanted?", "NTA. Talk to a lawyer and get your daughter into counseling. You need to explain to your daughter the situation of her birth and adoption appropriately before your sister explains it to her inappropriately. I wouldn\u2019t let her with them unsupervised because there\u2019s a nonzero chance they\u2019ll take her and run.", "NTA. She's your daughter now and they had their chance. They made choices and now they have to live with the consequences.\n\nProps to you OP and I hope your sister someday realizes her feelings aren't as important as that child's emotional well being.", "No way, NTA.  I can completely understand your sister wanting her daughter back as you have most likely done a wonderful job raising YOUR daughter and that is something she was unable to do.  You gave her the option a long time ago for this to be temporary and she declined, so what's done is done!  Now your sister needs boundaries and I feel like you have set up some healthy ones.  Be careful your sister doesn't spill the beans too early because WOW will that confuse a kid!    \nYou're a good mama and taking care for your child's well being.  She's a lucky little girl.", "NTA - your sis and her SO have some nerve! Actions have consequences and a child isn\u2019t a toy to be passed back and forth. They made their decisions and now have to live with these decisions. You offered temporary, you were so helpful and accommodating. Not the asshole in the very least. Your daughter is lucky to have you", "You guys need to get a handle on this somehow and reach some type of resolution for the sake of that child.

No one forced them to sign the adoption papers, and they were the ones to make that choice unprompted.\n\nIt's not in your daughter's best interests to pinball between households as her bio parents' whims dictate. Her needs come before everyone else's. If bio parents can't deal with that, you need to cut contact.\n\nI strongly recommend that you reach out to a child therapist. There's a growing amount of guidance around telling adopted children about their adoption when they're younger, and a good therapist can help you navigate the complicated situation you have while making sure your daughter's emotional needs are being met.", "Soft NTA- if she had done a closed adoption they might not have known where their child went? (Not really sure how the process works) \nBut because she went with family, I can see where your sisters confusion might have come from. Three years ago was she 17?18? And maybe not understanding of the full implications of her choices? That\u2019s where I feel it\u2019s fuzzy. Maybe therapy could help to open communication between you two in a healthy way or maybe clear up some of the emotions. \n\nYou\u2019ve stepped up and maintained a safe place for your daughter. I think as long as you keep putting her first your NTA, but your sister may not like or agree with your choices. I think it\u2019s going to be very complicated going forward having a healthy relationship with your sister if she basically thinks your being cruel.", "NTA", "NAH its an emotionally fraught situation for all involved.

Time for all to start some family counseling, and then some parent counseling for the 'aunt & uncle' so they can understand that their request is detrimental to the child and selfish. They may need to wait till she is 18 to be considered 'parents'. Closed adoptions have to wait for the child to try to find 'parents', and in some cases...it never happens.\n6.

The kids not a toy they can hand back and forth when things get too tough", "NTA\n\nI work with preschool age children, by 3 years old 80% of the child's brain is not just formed, but \"wired\" (how to accept love, abandonment, feelings, etc). \n\nThis would be very traumatic for the child to lose the only people they know as their parents, to go to \"new\" parents (even if your sister is biologically the mom).", "\u201cThey invited us over for dinner\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the two of them left\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re going to write fake stories at least keep the details straight.", "NTA, you need a lawyer right away.", "NTA \n\nYour husband and you stepped in a took a child when you didn\u2019t have to you. Already you are NTA. This child is emotionally bonded to you, I agree with you 100%. The child is gonna have abandonment wounds if you give them to your sister and her SO, they are gonna be confused, sad, lonely. \n\nDon\u2019t do it. Your sister should understand that the child and their well being ALWAYS comes first. That\u2019s what being a parent is. It\u2019s sacrifice. Eventually when you tell the child what happened it will be up to them to decide. But you are NTA. You are a great person for what you\u2019ve done so far.", "NTA so they turned their lives around and still aren\u2019t mature enough to know that adoption means gone forever? You better watch these visits carefully and be in the same room with them always, they will tell your child before she\u2019s mature enough to understand that she\u2019s their mommy and mentally f this child up..", "The only other thing I would suggest is that OP gets in front of the whole adoption thing now and tells her daughter in a way that she'll understand that's she's adopted, and that her auntie is her birth mom. OP needs to control the narrative with what the child is told because if the sister is deranged enough, she'll try and spin it in a way to make OP look bad.", "I just want to add that get a lawyer and child psychologist! Lawyer to protect your daughter and child psychologist so you know how to break the news to your daughter. Dont wait, its much easier to let her know she's adopted now than later and she wont end up resenting you. Your sister has a chance to give her a twist ver of the story if you wait too long", "This is the most nuanced response here so far. I think what a lot of N A H comments are missing is that OP gave her sister multiple opportunities to leave this open ended and she signed her rights away. Yes, it\u2019s a big choice for an 18yo to make, but so is having unprotected sex, so is choosing to carry full term. Regret is NOT a good enough reason to remove this child from the stability she has known, just like regret isn\u2019t a strong enough reason to bring a child into the world in the first place. PPD isn\u2019t a strong enough excuse either. I\u2019ve had mental health episodes in my life, but that doesn\u2019t negate the weight or consequences of my actions. Signing away parental rights isn\u2019t a one time action, it\u2019s a series of choices and steps with sanity checks along the way to ensure this is what\u2019s right for the kid and what everyone wants. OP\u2019s sister feels regret, and that\u2019s valid, but that\u2019s HER stuff to deal with. Pressing this issue makes it the kids stuff to deal with and that\u2019s not okay.", "This. Op, I\u2019m an attorney, and while I cannot give you legal advice I can tell you that you\u2019d do well to get some legal consults with an attorney, or several (to find one that meets your needs and budget). If you want to know what to look for let me know. Attorneys are something you need before poo hits the fan. Retain one as an offensive maneuver. \n\nI\u2019ve done a fair bit of custody cases, 99% of us are wonderfully kind people.", "this, Nta but you need to start limiting the visits more and more until its not a thing. Unless you want to lose your child to someone who hates you? Get ahead of this now.", ">Get a lawyer. Keep the visits supervised. \n\nThis completely. This woman and her partner have the potential to get vicious and vindictive, telling all sorts of lies to this child. These visits need heavily supervised. It's a shame as the OP sounds like such a decent person and she have this AH multiple chances. This sister seems to think she gave away some unwanted furniture or a television instead of a child that she thinks she has the right to demand her back like it's nothing.", "Yeah, honestly I'd be ***very*** careful with the visits now, zero time without close supervision - what happens when they tell her they're her real mom and dad and you ***took*** her from them?  They are thinking of themselves, not your daughter, and not even remotely of you, proceed with *extreme* caution from here on out and do not assume good intentions.", "This, OP read this. Don\u2019t give up on your girl, fight for her, she is your child. You have every right to go nc if sister doesn\u2019t drop it. I wish you all the luck.", "I agree so much. I always feel kind words are always best but you must have been scared for your child when you heard her. Try to take your sister out and talk with her, explain why you snapped, but if she won't have it, do not go back to the \"needlessly.\" You needed to protect the stability of your kid.", "Family adoptions happen all the time, especially when the birth parents are still teenagers. \n\nIt's only a problem when people lie or keep secrets. The little girl, if she doesn't know already, must be told now. By OP and her husband. Before she hears some confusing story from the birth mom. \n\nA therapist would be good, if just to facilitate this process, and I'm sure there are picture books about all the neat ways there are to make a family. \n\nHonestly, OP, I would gently create some distance from your sister for a while, now that you know this is how she feels and what she wants. Be busy when she asks to visit. And if your daughter is in preschool or daycare or anywhere she might be outside of your direct supervision, make sure the relevant people know about this as well. She can never leave unless it's with you or her father.", "Exactly!", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll this far to finally see this! I was wondering who did the dishes! :)", "Agreed - OP's answer was in the best interest of their daughter, but I find it hard to condemn the sister. Daughter needs to be told as soon as reasonable though. (Not now, obv)", "Yeah I agree. I think it's too late and is now in the best interests of the child, but I really question the morality of this adoption.", "You\u2019re missing an important point here, which is that ultimately it should be about what\u2019s best for the child. They weren\u2019t fit to be parents then, and seeing how selfish they are behaving here I don\u2019t think they\u2019re fit to be parents now.", "I love the optimism! Here\u2019s the one thing about your perspective, which I understand. If the sister legally signed away her parental rights at 18 as an adult legally for any kind of adoption - open or closed - (my personal opinion is that you are not an actual full adult when you\u2019re 18), there is no going back from that, no matter how much she may have regretted that decision.", "I'm with you. If you kick the bio parents out of the kids life, at 18 there's gonna be a lot of questions asked and the life that's gonna be upended is the child's, even if you're completely honest with them growing up. \n\nI feel for the kid the most here. Legally, you're in the clear. But in less than 15 years, that kid is gonna have their world upended.", "I also think this is the only way to get all parties at least a little happy. Otherwise, it just sucks. Again, NAH only people trying to be people.", "I mean then don\u2019t carry the child to term or don\u2019t have unprotected sex or at the very least son\u2019t immediately sign away all parental rights when people told you not to? Morally, you don\u2019t get to give up parental rights and then decide you\u2019re now emotionally and financially ready to rip the child away from their parents.", "I think the sister is an AH though.\n\nSwitching families at age 3 would be horrifically traumatic for a child developmentally. It would do serious harm to the kid.\n\nNo one who actually cares about a child would put soothing their own regret above that child's health. Having the regret didn't make her an AH, but feeling entitled to uproot the kid's life because of it most definitely does.", "Sure it adds up since it's fake.", "Yes I would suggest the help of a therapist to do this.", "This. The overwhelming majority of adopted people agree that children have a basic right to information re: their parentage and that it shouldn't be a \"wait and then break it to them\" situation. Employing a therapist to navigate the situation is a great idea.\n\nI can understand why the sister would have regrets, but her asking for custody back indicates to me that she *still* doesn't understand the importance of stability in a child's life. OP is NTA", "i agree with both of you, but i do wonder about the bio moms ability to make a final decision at that time in her life.  It\u2019s a sad situation all around.", "I was looking for a comment pointing out the child should be told she\u2019s adopted now, not when she\u2019s older", "Of course they do which is why I recommended seeking a good family therapist to help navigate it.\n\nMy point is that there are unique issues when it is an adoption by a close family member because that family member is going to be around presumably versus even an open adoption with a stranger where typically there is going to not be the same type of issues relating to the bio parent being physically around.\n\nAlso there would likely to be issues of family dynamics as well as sibling rivalry or other stuff that needs to be dealt with in terms of acting in the best interests of the child.\n\nWhether it is a secret or not and obviously keeping it a secret or not, there are issues that specifically arise from it being an adoption from a sibling. I think it is even more likely when the reason for the adoption was that the bio parents were young, immature and not willing/able to be parents at the time of the birth.", "I don't see how they are being selfish. They asked to take over custody of a three year old who is biologically theirs and knows them, not the same as coming back after 10 year of almost no contact and wanting their baby back. Really there should not have been an adoption, OP should have insisted on legal guardianship instead and known that two teenagers weren't capable of making a permanent decision yet. I think OP did come on too strong with the aunt or nothing ultimatum and a ten-year delay. The sister still agreed and continues to be in her daughter's life, but understandably is cold to OP, I'm not seeing selfishness on the sister's part.", "Or make it so abortion is free and legal everywhere. So daycare is regulated and affordable. So social benefits and security ensure that NO one goes to bed hungry. \n\nA child should NOT be a consequence of unprotected sex. A child's life should not be treated as a punishment.", "I can see that perspective. \n\nIt really sounds like the sister and boyfriend are hurting and are clouded by that hurt. I doubt they can see, at this point, that what they were asking for was uprooting their niece.\n\nI hope they do therapy!!", "I disagree, but to a small extent. This child is 3, conversations about where she comes from should have already been started (at an age appropriate level), there should be no \u201ccoming out of the closet\u201d type situation with adopted kids. If they grow up knowing their adopted from a very young age - then there are no surprises.\n\nTo that end, what is she going to think when she\u2019s old enough to understand that her biological parents wanted her, but her adoptive parents stopped that from happening. \n\nThis is a situation that sucks for all involved; bio parents made a VERY tough decision to give up their daughter because they knew they weren\u2019t good enough for her at the time, adoptive parents stepped up and took responsibility for her, and an innocent child is dealing with the trauma that innately comes from adoption. \n\nI think the adults could have handled this much better. Start with telling the kid the truth, then maybe some overnight visits, discuss possibility of joint custody (both adults alone and with the kid). This little girl is obviously very loved, so the people that love her should be focusing on how to handle a very difficult situation with a focus solely on the entire emotional well being of the kid (not just the right now).", "I just want to tag on here to point out that this took place when the baby was SIX MONTHS OLD. \n\nI have a lot of sympathy for people who feel that they are not ready/willing/able to be parents, more than a lot of people on this sub. I think society pushes people into being parents when they're not ready to be. \n\nBut to me I think people need to really stop and think about the fact that OP's sister cared for that baby for six months and *then* made the choice to have her adopted. That is a very, very serious decision that she made, and *she* is the one who made it permanent, not OP. Babies are not something you get to go 'yeah, here, take it' and then go 'just kidding I change my mind!' \n\nI don't have much sympathy for her or her current attitude, to be honest, and I hope that OP fights like hell to make sure that her daughter doesn't go back.", "I mean, if she's willing to rip a child away from the only parents they've known to play house she's ***still*** not fit to be a parent", "it doesn't matter, it's over now\n\nyou don't just get to arbitrarily decide to be a parent again after you give up your kid for adoption\n\nit does not work like that", "This child thinks that OP is her mother. The plan was to explain the situation to her when she\u2019s a bit older (hence the 10 years). How would you explain to a three year old that her mom is not her real mom and that she will from now on live with her aunt who is her real mom? As far as we can tell from this post, OP is worried about exactly that, and her sister is calling her petty, cruel and vengeful for it. So yeah all I hear is \u201eMe! Me! Me!\u201c from the biological mother.\n\nEdit: regarding the legal guardianship, OP offered a temporary adoption, for exactly this reason, which they declined.", "I honestly do feel bad for her; I don't think there was ever a happy ending available. She had the baby and gave it her best shot, and after 6 months, realized that she couldn't do it. I also think it was a mature decision to say no to the \"maybe you'll want to take her back instead of full adoption\" thing and have the self-awareness to realize she couldn't do it and couldn't foresee that changing in the near future. \n\nHaving regrets now, when she's got a little distance and things aren't as dire, seems really normal to me. It doesn't mean that essentially un-adopting was a reasonable request, but her entire family (except OP) abandoning her for doing it is a hell of a lot of pressure for her to endlessly question that decision. \n\nI doubt she'll be mad forever; there's no doubt that she needs a lot of therapy to get through it though. I just have a hard time faulting her for coming up with a bad idea when there really isn't a clear path to being okay.", "It\u2019s recommended to start telling children this age (3-4) that they are adopted.\n\nIt should be information that they always remember knowing."]}
