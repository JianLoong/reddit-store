They were still finishing high school, and the whole thing was very overwhelming for them, they obviously weren't planning on a kid. They tried, but they both have some mental health struggles (the SO from birth, my sister from PPD and of course the stress for both of them) and they just couldn't give her what she needed.\n\nThey decided about six months after she was born to give her up for adoption. Our parents wouldn't take her, so my now husband and I stepped up. We wanted kids anyway, and I hated the thought of losing my niece, so we offered and they accepted. We also offered to make it temporary while they went to school and got sorted, but they said no, they were not confidant in their ability to be parents, and signed their rights away. The process was official, and essentially our daughter legally is no different than any other adopted child, she's ours.\n\nMy sister doing this burned a lot of bridges in the family, which I didn't want. Our parents and the extended family basically disowned her for abandoning her daughter, we're very LC with them as a result. My sister and her SO are still involved in our daughters life, she sees them as aunt and uncle, though we are planning on telling her everything as she grows up.\n\nThe two of them really did turn their lives around in the past three years. My sister graduates this year, and he managed to find a trade job that pays well. We were glad, but we weren't expecting them to ask what they did next. They invited us over for dinner, and basically admitted to regretting giving up their kid more than anything. They wanted to start the process of giving them custody back.\n\nI immediately told them that wasn't happening. It's not that they don't have the means now, it's that emotionally they aren't her parents, my husband and I are. She wouldn't be exited to be back with her parents, she'd be wondering why we dumped her to her aunt and uncle. I told her that, if by some chance in ten years she decides to live with them, we'll allow that, but we don't expect that to happen.\n\nShe got upset, and said we were being cruel, and accused us of being petty and vengeful. Here's where I might've gone too far, I told her if she doesn't agree to drop this now and forever, she won't get to visit anymore. Basically she can either be an aunt or nothing, her call. She gave me such a hateful look, but agreed, and the two of them left.\n\nSince then she still comes by to visit her niece, but basically pretends I don't exist. I don't regret our decision, it's just maybe I came on too strong, and needlessly ruined my relationship with my sister.", "created_utc": 1683985076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ghu1a/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_shell_never_get/", "score": 2962, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep the visits supervised. You told them if your daughter chose you'd let her go to them. Don't think for a minute she's not going to play mind games with your daughter to have her choose them.\n\nYou gave them the opportunity to make it temporary. They said no. You allow them to be in the child's life. It's a tough thing to watch your biological child raised by another person, but it's the child's best interests that matter, not your sister's feelings. If she really cared about the child she'd know how much it would mess her up to 'switch mommies'.", "You stepped forward with a major lifelong commitment to family, offered them the opportunity to eventually reverse it - which they declined - and provide a loving home to a child.  \n\nFurthermore, it can be emotionally confusing to a child to be exposed to such family conflict. If it is in your power to keep that conflict from them, that is not asshole behavior, it's good parenting.    For all these things:   \n\n\nNTA  \n\n\nYes, you may have ruined your relationship with your sister.  However, I look at that word \"needlessly\" askance - you did it, I suggest, because you have made a lifelong commitment to your child, your child's well being depends in part on that commitment, and your sisters'  variable behavior toward the child could cause trauma - which you are protecting the child from.   That's self-sacrifice.  So much NTA.", "NTA. You stepped up and took your niece in when no one else would. They signed over their parental rights, aka, they have no right to take the child back. She is legally your child. \n\nKudos to you for maintaining the bond between the child and her bio parents. That is very healthy for the child, despite the hiccups that may occur. \n\nTo remove her from you would only traumatize her further and your sister needs to understand that. You are her mother. She would be very confused, afraid and probably angry to be uprooted from the only home she knows. Your sister and her SO are hurting, and now that they are doing better they are realizing what they\u2019ve lost. \n\nYou made the right decision. Continue to encourage your sister to see her, but she must respect the boundaries SHE ultimately created. Like it was previously mentioned, when your daughter is old enough to decide for herself, let her choose who she wants to be with. \n\nYou clearly love your sister and your daughter. I think you are doing an amazing job putting your daughter first \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, they gave up their rights, if it was a different family, they wouldn\u2019t be able to just ask for custody back because now they feel ready to be parents. \n\nAlso, you offered for it to be temporary and they said no, it\u2019s an adoption, she\u2019s your kid.", "NTA! Imagine if she had given her up for adoption to another family- do you think they would give her back? Not a chance. You are her parents and that\u2019s all she knows it would be traumatic for her to be taken away from you! Can\u2019t your sister just babysit more and get to know her (with boundaries of course) instead of trying to take her away from her parents?", "NTA\n\nYou needed to nip this in the bud. Kids aren't convenient accessories for the adults around them. Their developmental needs for attachment and consistency should be the top priority over the regrets of people who gave them up.\n\nYour sister even asking this question tells me she isn't ready to be a parent for your daughter, because she's thinking of what she wants and seems completely oblivious to the damage such a switch at this age would do.\n\nProtect your daughter, and if your sister has access to your house, you may want to make sure you have cameras and record any future evidence of arguments over this + don't leave her alone with your daughter if you can avoid it.", "NTA. she's been your daughter for 2 and 1/2 years. They gave up their rights.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is thinking about herself and her wants/needs/regrets. \nYou are thinking about a 3 year old child's well-being.\nThey are very different things.", "Clearly your sister hasn't grown up enough to realise and understand what this all means and how this will effect the child\nTo just ignore you like you don't exist shows how childish she is.

Toxic energy around kids isn't needed.\n\nNta", "NTA - you are looking out for your kid.", "NTA and most of the other adults in your family are, not for being unable to care for the kid but for stigmatizing your sister and making drama over the adoption to the point where you had to go LC. Your sister is behaving cluelessly if she thinks she can just rip the kid away after years of you raising her as parents. Your daughter is going to see right through this because kids are smart and perceptive.", "NTA but realistically I don't know how you navigate the reality of your sister being the biological mother of your adopted daughter.\n\nAs you point out, at some point your daughter is going to know the truth and it might well end up with your bio daughter resenting you for keeping her from her \\*real\\* parents even though your intentions were good.\n\nI think consulting now with a very skilled child psychologist in order to figure out the best way to handle the situation in terms of the needs of the child and not either of the adults. I understand why adoption by a close family member seems to make a lot of emotional sense in the moment but it is not without its risks as well since the close relative is going to normally be in the picture and even with an \"open adoption\" with a stranger there isn't the situation of there being the kind of interaction that occurs within most families as the non-related bio parent isn't going to around constantly", "Info: Was your sister receiving any treatment for her PPD? Did your sister have a lawyer that was advising her along the way during the adoption process?", "NTA\n\nShe is your child and they gave up all rights. That being said, I do think some things were said that should probably be walked back, on both sides. There's resentment from your sister's view now and that never leads to anything good. You both need to heal that somehow, before your daughter is old enough to learn what's happened.", "NTA. You were protecting your daugher from people suggesting they want to take her away. They might think they are fixing their past mistake, but they are actually making the same mistake a second time. They are putting their needs above their childs and making a big decision.\n\nI think it might be a good idea if you tell your child sooner rather than later though. You do not want her to hear from your sister.", "NAH but maybe talk this out with r/adoption and get some adoptee perspectives on the best ways to navigate this relationship and remember, your sister and her SO didn't stop loving her when they signed those papers.", "NTA. Can you imagine asking this if she weren\u2019t your sister? While it\u2019s okay for anyone to feel their feelings and have regrets, because we\u2019re human, her expectation is unreasonable/unrealistic. You legally adopted the child. Full stop.", "ESH. Don't wait to tell your daughter that she's adopted and her aunt and uncle are her bio parents. It's really really important to do that as early as possible for her mental health.", "NTA and a little N A H: But I would ask you sister to have a sit down and apologize for how you came off. Explain that while you can\u2019t change the custody agreement both for your daughter\u2019s sake and your sake, the intensity of how you responded was due to panic. And maybe consider doing the following\n\n1. Being a mom to a child for 2-3 years results in a super strong attachment for both. Changing custody would be damaging to both of you.\n\n2. (Think about this carefully before hand) but maybe discuss with your sister a timeline of when you can start to explain to your daughter her birth\n\nWhile you are NTA the goal should be to work through the upset that was caused and repair your relationship.

This is not healthy for your kid.", "They invited you over for dinner, and then the two of them left?", "NAH. Many, many birth parents regret their decision to relinquish a child (definitely not all though) and I'm sure it's painful for your sister. But you did give them the chance that they didn't take and you're not wrong for holding them to it after parenting for so long.\n\nI would strongly suggest that you talk to an adoption centered child therapist, preferably with your sister. The 4 of you can work out the best way to move forward in a way that is good for your daughter.\n\nSince this was a family adoption I'm guessing that you didn't get the sort of pre adoption education that most APs get. You really need to already be telling your daughter her birth story in an age appropriate way. I know you plan to talk to her about it when she's older but it is important for her to always have known her origins to minimize the trauma that it can cause.", "What you said was harsh, but we\u2019re all capable of that sometimes. No assholes here,  just people that are hurting.", "I have to say NAH. Your sister made a decision while she was roughly 18 and suffering from PPD; I can't call her an AH for now regretting this.", "There\u2019s almost no way for this to end well. Not as is. Legally, you are right. Morally\u2026 no 18yo is going to be able to make a \u201cforever\u201d decision like that will full knowledge. It\u2019s hard to make a judgement here.\n\nThink you guys can do, essentially, group therapy and learn how to co-parent? I know of a setup which essentially has all the people living together and the kid has more than two parents and they actively work with each other and a therapist to make it work. \n\nSeems a high bar to reach, but I\u2019m feeling relentlessly optimistic this morning.", "NAH. It sounds like the four of you have a good relationship. Enough so that you went LC with the rest of your family to stay close to your sister.\n\nYour sister and her boyfriend were young when they made the decision to give up their daughter. Now that they are a bit more settled in their adulthood, they are feeling regret. It's very normal. They can see the life they could've given their daughter if they had her now. \n\nIt must be very hard for them but that doesn't mean you have to give your daughter to them. Three years is a lot of time to bond and you're right your daughter will be confused.\n\nI agree with the other commenter that suggested group therapy. Because of your otherwise good relationship, it seems like something very beautiful and healing can come from this.", "NTA- This isn't an easy situation but sending a three year old to live with people she doesn't know as her parents is not a good plan. I'd let her know as soon as she's old enough.", "NTA. You are the only parents your daughter has ever known and are looking out for her the best you can. I get the feeling, though, that your sister and her partner are just thinking of their needs and not of their daughter\u2019s. And what is best for the daughter *has* to come first. \n\nIf they were thinking of your daughter first, they could of done something similar to what you suggested - wait, be patient, develop their relationship with the girl, and see what she wants in the future. But you can\u2019t just take a child from the only parents she has known because it is convenient for you now.", "Info, when your sister was planning on the adoption was she looking for a closed adoption with strangers? Did you convince her to let family take the child or was that what they wanted?", "NTA. Talk to a lawyer and get your daughter into counseling. You need to explain to your daughter the situation of her birth and adoption appropriately before your sister explains it to her inappropriately. I wouldn\u2019t let her with them unsupervised because there\u2019s a nonzero chance they\u2019ll take her and run.", "NTA. She's your daughter now and they had their chance. They made choices and now they have to live with the consequences.\n\nProps to you OP and I hope your sister someday realizes her feelings aren't as important as that child's emotional well being.", "No way, NTA.  I can completely understand your sister wanting her daughter back as you have most likely done a wonderful job raising YOUR daughter and that is something she was unable to do.  You gave her the option a long time ago for this to be temporary and she declined, so what's done is done!  Now your sister needs boundaries and I feel like you have set up some healthy ones.  Be careful your sister doesn't spill the beans too early because WOW will that confuse a kid!    \nYou're a good mama and taking care for your child's well being.  She's a lucky little girl.", "NTA - your sis and her SO have some nerve! Actions have consequences and a child isn\u2019t a toy to be passed back and forth. They made their decisions and now have to live with these decisions. You offered temporary, you were so helpful and accommodating. Not the asshole in the very least. Your daughter is lucky to have you", "You guys need to get a handle on this somehow and reach some type of resolution for the sake of that child.

No one forced them to sign the adoption papers, and they were the ones to make that choice unprompted.\n\nIt's not in your daughter's best interests to pinball between households as her bio parents' whims dictate. Her needs come before everyone else's. If bio parents can't deal with that, you need to cut contact.\n\nI strongly recommend that you reach out to a child therapist. There's a growing amount of guidance around telling adopted children about their adoption when they're younger, and a good therapist can help you navigate the complicated situation you have while making sure your daughter's emotional needs are being met.", "Soft NTA- if she had done a closed adoption they might not have known where their child went? (Not really sure how the process works) \nBut because she went with family, I can see where your sisters confusion might have come from. Three years ago was she 17?18? And maybe not understanding of the full implications of her choices? That\u2019s where I feel it\u2019s fuzzy. Maybe therapy could help to open communication between you two in a healthy way or maybe clear up some of the emotions. \n\nYou\u2019ve stepped up and maintained a safe place for your daughter. I think as long as you keep putting her first your NTA, but your sister may not like or agree with your choices. I think it\u2019s going to be very complicated going forward having a healthy relationship with your sister if she basically thinks your being cruel.", "NTA", "NAH its an emotionally fraught situation for all involved.

Time for all to start some family counseling, and then some parent counseling for the 'aunt & uncle' so they can understand that their request is detrimental to the child and selfish. They may need to wait till she is 18 to be considered 'parents'. Closed adoptions have to wait for the child to try to find 'parents', and in some cases...it never happens.\n6.

The kids not a toy they can hand back and forth when things get too tough", "NTA\n\nI work with preschool age children, by 3 years old 80% of the child's brain is not just formed, but \"wired\" (how to accept love, abandonment, feelings, etc). \n\nThis would be very traumatic for the child to lose the only people they know as their parents, to go to \"new\" parents (even if your sister is biologically the mom).", "\u201cThey invited us over for dinner\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the two of them left\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re going to write fake stories at least keep the details straight.", "NTA, you need a lawyer right away.", "NTA \n\nYour husband and you stepped in a took a child when you didn\u2019t have to you. Already you are NTA. This child is emotionally bonded to you, I agree with you 100%. The child is gonna have abandonment wounds if you give them to your sister and her SO, they are gonna be confused, sad, lonely. \n\nDon\u2019t do it. Your sister should understand that the child and their well being ALWAYS comes first. That\u2019s what being a parent is. It\u2019s sacrifice. Eventually when you tell the child what happened it will be up to them to decide. But you are NTA. You are a great person for what you\u2019ve done so far.", "NTA so they turned their lives around and still aren\u2019t mature enough to know that adoption means gone forever? You better watch these visits carefully and be in the same room with them always, they will tell your child before she\u2019s mature enough to understand that she\u2019s their mommy and mentally f this child up..", "The only other thing I would suggest is that OP gets in front of the whole adoption thing now and tells her daughter in a way that she'll understand that's she's adopted, and that her auntie is her birth mom. OP needs to control the narrative with what the child is told because if the sister is deranged enough, she'll try and spin it in a way to make OP look bad.", "I just want to add that get a lawyer and child psychologist! Lawyer to protect your daughter and child psychologist so you know how to break the news to your daughter. Dont wait, its much easier to let her know she's adopted now than later and she wont end up resenting you. Your sister has a chance to give her a twist ver of the story if you wait too long", "This is the most nuanced response here so far. I think what a lot of N A H comments are missing is that OP gave her sister multiple opportunities to leave this open ended and she signed her rights away. Yes, it\u2019s a big choice for an 18yo to make, but so is having unprotected sex, so is choosing to carry full term. Regret is NOT a good enough reason to remove this child from the stability she has known, just like regret isn\u2019t a strong enough reason to bring a child into the world in the first place. PPD isn\u2019t a strong enough excuse either. I\u2019ve had mental health episodes in my life, but that doesn\u2019t negate the weight or consequences of my actions. Signing away parental rights isn\u2019t a one time action, it\u2019s a series of choices and steps with sanity checks along the way to ensure this is what\u2019s right for the kid and what everyone wants. OP\u2019s sister feels regret, and that\u2019s valid, but that\u2019s HER stuff to deal with. Pressing this issue makes it the kids stuff to deal with and that\u2019s not okay.", "This. Op, I\u2019m an attorney, and while I cannot give you legal advice I can tell you that you\u2019d do well to get some legal consults with an attorney, or several (to find one that meets your needs and budget). If you want to know what to look for let me know. Attorneys are something you need before poo hits the fan. Retain one as an offensive maneuver. \n\nI\u2019ve done a fair bit of custody cases, 99% of us are wonderfully kind people.", "this, Nta but you need to start limiting the visits more and more until its not a thing. Unless you want to lose your child to someone who hates you? Get ahead of this now.", ">Get a lawyer. Keep the visits supervised. \n\nThis completely. This woman and her partner have the potential to get vicious and vindictive, telling all sorts of lies to this child. These visits need heavily supervised. It's a shame as the OP sounds like such a decent person and she have this AH multiple chances. This sister seems to think she gave away some unwanted furniture or a television instead of a child that she thinks she has the right to demand her back like it's nothing.", "Yeah, honestly I'd be ***very*** careful with the visits now, zero time without close supervision - what happens when they tell her they're her real mom and dad and you ***took*** her from them?  They are thinking of themselves, not your daughter, and not even remotely of you, proceed with *extreme* caution from here on out and do not assume good intentions.", "This, OP read this. Don\u2019t give up on your girl, fight for her, she is your child. You have every right to go nc if sister doesn\u2019t drop it. I wish you all the luck.", "I agree so much. I always feel kind words are always best but you must have been scared for your child when you heard her. Try to take your sister out and talk with her, explain why you snapped, but if she won't have it, do not go back to the \"needlessly.\" You needed to protect the stability of your kid.", "Family adoptions happen all the time, especially when the birth parents are still teenagers. \n\nIt's only a problem when people lie or keep secrets. The little girl, if she doesn't know already, must be told now. By OP and her husband. Before she hears some confusing story from the birth mom. \n\nA therapist would be good, if just to facilitate this process, and I'm sure there are picture books about all the neat ways there are to make a family. \n\nHonestly, OP, I would gently create some distance from your sister for a while, now that you know this is how she feels and what she wants. Be busy when she asks to visit. And if your daughter is in preschool or daycare or anywhere she might be outside of your direct supervision, make sure the relevant people know about this as well. She can never leave unless it's with you or her father.", "Exactly!", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll this far to finally see this! I was wondering who did the dishes! :)", "Agreed - OP's answer was in the best interest of their daughter, but I find it hard to condemn the sister. Daughter needs to be told as soon as reasonable though. (Not now, obv)", "Yeah I agree. I think it's too late and is now in the best interests of the child, but I really question the morality of this adoption.", "You\u2019re missing an important point here, which is that ultimately it should be about what\u2019s best for the child. They weren\u2019t fit to be parents then, and seeing how selfish they are behaving here I don\u2019t think they\u2019re fit to be parents now.", "I love the optimism! Here\u2019s the one thing about your perspective, which I understand. If the sister legally signed away her parental rights at 18 as an adult legally for any kind of adoption - open or closed - (my personal opinion is that you are not an actual full adult when you\u2019re 18), there is no going back from that, no matter how much she may have regretted that decision.", "I'm with you. If you kick the bio parents out of the kids life, at 18 there's gonna be a lot of questions asked and the life that's gonna be upended is the child's, even if you're completely honest with them growing up. \n\nI feel for the kid the most here. Legally, you're in the clear. But in less than 15 years, that kid is gonna have their world upended.", "I also think this is the only way to get all parties at least a little happy. Otherwise, it just sucks. Again, NAH only people trying to be people.", "I mean then don\u2019t carry the child to term or don\u2019t have unprotected sex or at the very least son\u2019t immediately sign away all parental rights when people told you not to? Morally, you don\u2019t get to give up parental rights and then decide you\u2019re now emotionally and financially ready to rip the child away from their parents.", "I think the sister is an AH though.\n\nSwitching families at age 3 would be horrifically traumatic for a child developmentally. It would do serious harm to the kid.\n\nNo one who actually cares about a child would put soothing their own regret above that child's health. Having the regret didn't make her an AH, but feeling entitled to uproot the kid's life because of it most definitely does.", "Sure it adds up since it's fake.", "Yes I would suggest the help of a therapist to do this.", "This. The overwhelming majority of adopted people agree that children have a basic right to information re: their parentage and that it shouldn't be a \"wait and then break it to them\" situation. Employing a therapist to navigate the situation is a great idea.\n\nI can understand why the sister would have regrets, but her asking for custody back indicates to me that she *still* doesn't understand the importance of stability in a child's life. OP is NTA", "i agree with both of you, but i do wonder about the bio moms ability to make a final decision at that time in her life.  It\u2019s a sad situation all around.", "I was looking for a comment pointing out the child should be told she\u2019s adopted now, not when she\u2019s older", "Of course they do which is why I recommended seeking a good family therapist to help navigate it.\n\nMy point is that there are unique issues when it is an adoption by a close family member because that family member is going to be around presumably versus even an open adoption with a stranger where typically there is going to not be the same type of issues relating to the bio parent being physically around.\n\nAlso there would likely to be issues of family dynamics as well as sibling rivalry or other stuff that needs to be dealt with in terms of acting in the best interests of the child.\n\nWhether it is a secret or not and obviously keeping it a secret or not, there are issues that specifically arise from it being an adoption from a sibling. I think it is even more likely when the reason for the adoption was that the bio parents were young, immature and not willing/able to be parents at the time of the birth.", "I don't see how they are being selfish. They asked to take over custody of a three year old who is biologically theirs and knows them, not the same as coming back after 10 year of almost no contact and wanting their baby back. Really there should not have been an adoption, OP should have insisted on legal guardianship instead and known that two teenagers weren't capable of making a permanent decision yet. I think OP did come on too strong with the aunt or nothing ultimatum and a ten-year delay. The sister still agreed and continues to be in her daughter's life, but understandably is cold to OP, I'm not seeing selfishness on the sister's part.", "Or make it so abortion is free and legal everywhere. So daycare is regulated and affordable. So social benefits and security ensure that NO one goes to bed hungry. \n\nA child should NOT be a consequence of unprotected sex. A child's life should not be treated as a punishment.", "I can see that perspective. \n\nIt really sounds like the sister and boyfriend are hurting and are clouded by that hurt. I doubt they can see, at this point, that what they were asking for was uprooting their niece.\n\nI hope they do therapy!!", "I disagree, but to a small extent. This child is 3, conversations about where she comes from should have already been started (at an age appropriate level), there should be no \u201ccoming out of the closet\u201d type situation with adopted kids. If they grow up knowing their adopted from a very young age - then there are no surprises.\n\nTo that end, what is she going to think when she\u2019s old enough to understand that her biological parents wanted her, but her adoptive parents stopped that from happening. \n\nThis is a situation that sucks for all involved; bio parents made a VERY tough decision to give up their daughter because they knew they weren\u2019t good enough for her at the time, adoptive parents stepped up and took responsibility for her, and an innocent child is dealing with the trauma that innately comes from adoption. \n\nI think the adults could have handled this much better. Start with telling the kid the truth, then maybe some overnight visits, discuss possibility of joint custody (both adults alone and with the kid). This little girl is obviously very loved, so the people that love her should be focusing on how to handle a very difficult situation with a focus solely on the entire emotional well being of the kid (not just the right now).", "I just want to tag on here to point out that this took place when the baby was SIX MONTHS OLD. \n\nI have a lot of sympathy for people who feel that they are not ready/willing/able to be parents, more than a lot of people on this sub. I think society pushes people into being parents when they're not ready to be. \n\nBut to me I think people need to really stop and think about the fact that OP's sister cared for that baby for six months and *then* made the choice to have her adopted. That is a very, very serious decision that she made, and *she* is the one who made it permanent, not OP. Babies are not something you get to go 'yeah, here, take it' and then go 'just kidding I change my mind!' \n\nI don't have much sympathy for her or her current attitude, to be honest, and I hope that OP fights like hell to make sure that her daughter doesn't go back.", "I mean, if she's willing to rip a child away from the only parents they've known to play house she's ***still*** not fit to be a parent", "it doesn't matter, it's over now\n\nyou don't just get to arbitrarily decide to be a parent again after you give up your kid for adoption\n\nit does not work like that", "This child thinks that OP is her mother. The plan was to explain the situation to her when she\u2019s a bit older (hence the 10 years). How would you explain to a three year old that her mom is not her real mom and that she will from now on live with her aunt who is her real mom? As far as we can tell from this post, OP is worried about exactly that, and her sister is calling her petty, cruel and vengeful for it. So yeah all I hear is \u201eMe! Me! Me!\u201c from the biological mother.\n\nEdit: regarding the legal guardianship, OP offered a temporary adoption, for exactly this reason, which they declined.", "I honestly do feel bad for her; I don't think there was ever a happy ending available. She had the baby and gave it her best shot, and after 6 months, realized that she couldn't do it. I also think it was a mature decision to say no to the \"maybe you'll want to take her back instead of full adoption\" thing and have the self-awareness to realize she couldn't do it and couldn't foresee that changing in the near future. \n\nHaving regrets now, when she's got a little distance and things aren't as dire, seems really normal to me. It doesn't mean that essentially un-adopting was a reasonable request, but her entire family (except OP) abandoning her for doing it is a hell of a lot of pressure for her to endlessly question that decision. \n\nI doubt she'll be mad forever; there's no doubt that she needs a lot of therapy to get through it though. I just have a hard time faulting her for coming up with a bad idea when there really isn't a clear path to being okay.", "It\u2019s recommended to start telling children this age (3-4) that they are adopted.\n\nIt should be information that they always remember knowing.", "Your daughter will grow to hate you once she learns the truth. I\u2019m sad for her.", "They left their own house angry?", "YTA. I agree with your fundamental decision but threatening to take away visitation is cruel and manipulative. Stand by your decision because it's for the good of your daughter. But taking her aunt away from her would surely harm her. So show some integrity and let her welfare, rather than your in-the-moment emotions, guide you.", "ESH. Your sister did what was best for her baby at the time, and made a permanent decision in the midst of PPD. The ultimate goal should have always been reunification with sane, sober, reliable parents. Your family have been horrible to her for making a very mature, selfless decision. Now that she has turned her life around, you are telling her too bad, this kid is spoken for, and you'll cut her off for wanting to be a parent again.", "My heart breaks for this child at the end of this. This will back fire in the long run on the OP. The longer all of this is hidden from the child the more it will cause problems.\nAs much as an adopted child loves their adopted parents, there is always a part of them that wants to seek out their biological parents. This can be just to have the connection to know why? To have your biological parents (under your nose the whole time) who want to be with you, are being purposely kept away.. will back fire for sure.\nIt is disgusting to see OP, a woman, taking advantage of another woman who, in the midst of PPD made an h fortunate decision that will no doubt affect her for the rest of her life. Maybe trying to get her help, supporting her in another way? Yet, realizing she was young, immature and not in the current mental state and was struggling- it was the perfect time to take advantage of her.  You could have insisted on her not signing her rights away because again she was in the midst of PPD and needed support. Blended families happen in a myriad of ways. I\u2019m all for working for the best for all members of the family here. Drawing such harsh lines in the sand (and taking advantage of family) is a good way to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.", "NAH.

If you would like to keep your sister\u2019s child then you best learn how to communicate more kindly and patiently with her, respecting her relationship with her child, lest she get the courts involved in a legal battle that will no doubt be horrible for the whole family and the child in question in particular.

I know that's not exactly what this is about; but imagine you find out after your entire life that *not only* are you adopted but your *biological parents* are your aunt and uncle.\n \nThis needs to be broached carefully considering the circumstances, but experts agree that children should be told they are adopted when they are still children (the recommended age is 4-5 years old). Finding out as an adult is devastating because you find out your entire life is a lie, even if that wasn't the intention.\n \nYou need to be honest with your daughter, for her sake.

The longer they wait to deliver the news, the more likely the child is to feel he has been lied to and to experience trust issues. If the child is told early on that he was specifically chosen to be a part of a family, his perception of adoptive status is more likely to be positive. The older the child is when the news is revealed, the more of an explanation of the circumstances is likely to be called for.\n \n>The most common recommendation to adoptive parents is to disclose the adoption story to their child at a young age. The reasoning is that a belated revelation can be harmful to mental health because a child learns his parents have misled or lied to him for a long period of time. No one likes to be lied to, but lies from a parent are especially hard to take. A major breach of trust has occurred.\n \n>Late discovery that one is an adoptee is linked to psychological distress along with feelings of anger and betrayal as well as depression and anxiety.\n \n>The older the adoptee was when they learned of their adoption [according to Baden's study], the higher level of distress they experienced. The study\u2019s results suggested an adoptee\u2019s learning of his adoption after age three could have negative consequences on the adoptee\u2019s further life satisfaction and mental health.\n \n>Failing to make that revelation [that your child is adopted] is extremely harmful to the adoptee because they will experience a loss of identity and feel their entire life has been a lie.

Way too far.\n\nWhat changed since you last offered the custody to be temporary? Kid is 3? \n\nYou have an opportunity to help this kid to have a good relationship with you and her bio mom and instead you\u2019ve given in to fear thinking and holding your sister\u2019s young decisions against her punitively.\n\nI get it. Kids made some bad decisions and had kids. Then they signed away their parental rights to you because they were understandably afraid and overwhelmed children themselves.\n\nHave you considered how predatory that is? Saying \u201cno take backs! You signed everything when you were 18\u201d is again, legally correct but again, makes you a asshole. This is your sister.\n\nLook, what you did was a big deal and great in the beginning, but at the moment, you are lying to your adopted child about who her bio mom is and \u201cplanning to tell her later\u201d. Then using it as a rationalization to blackmail her bio mom and your sister so that you can keep the kid until you are ready to tell the kid the truth. \n\nYou are not protecting her feelings. You are protecting yours. Since you and many here are comfortable holding a kid responsible for her decisions and punishing her for it, I don\u2019t feel bad saying you CHOSE to lie to your adopted kid and now you want to protect that lie that you told and THIS is why their feelings would be hurt if they were told the truth from the start. That lie is the obstacle here.\n\nNow you\u2019ve blackmailed your younger sister by threatening to withhold visitation to her bio child against her. You didn\u2019t just go to far you fucked up your relationship with your sister in a pretty ugly way and may be jeopardizing your relationship with this child when they grow up.\n\nSo, let\u2019s play this out over the next 10 years. When this young person finds out that you have been lying to her about her \u201caunt\u201d and \u201cuncle\u201d this whole time who is actually her bio mom. Who was blackmailed into lying about it for god knows how long.\n\nI do think that the child\u2019s interest is the most important here but you aren\u2019t acting in her best interest you are being driven by fear of losing your 3 year old daughter rather than working with your sister and her SO to transition the kid to a better relationship with everyone (you, your partner, the kid, the bio mom and father).\n\nIf you put aside your fear and worked together and focused on the child\u2019s fully informed consent over time and moved at their pace, perhaps facilitated by a councilor/professional, you may find that this doesn\u2019t have to be adversarial at all. You may find that this process doesn\u2019t even require lawyers for a long time if ever.\n\nIt COULD be an opportunity to bond as a family. It could be a situation where the story this kid gets to grow up in is, \u201cmy bio mom was really young and scared when she had me so her big sister became my other mommy who took care of me and loved me and protected me until my bio mommy was older and less scared / more able to take care of me\u201d and then they both raised me and I am so happy about that.\n\nInstead, well, you\u2019ve changed your mind about your offers under a pretense of traumatizing a kid you lied to in the first place and yes, you are legally right, well within your rights, but this doesn\u2019t make you any less of a asshole. \n\nYour sister is older, has turned her life around, and regrets a decision she made when she was 18.

I was a kid whose mom lied a lot to him and who had to go through a ugly divorce when I was young and let me tell you something, if you really gave a fuck about the kids feelings, consider that the truth of their position, when communicated to them lovingly and with support, is way healthier than the path you have chosen. \n\nThe path you have chosen is one where a kid grows up, finds out they were lied to \u201cfor their own good\u201d to protect them from their biological mother and father and that they were used to blackmail their bio parents who they thought were their fucking aunt and uncle for their whole life.\n\nParents often tell themselves they will tell their kids the truth \u201cwhen the kids are ready for it\u201d and that is mostly bs in my lived experience. \n\nIn my life, parents tell their kids the truth when the PARENTS are ready.

My aunt didn\u2019t tell her the truth until she was in her twenties. This obviously blew up in my aunts face, and my cousin completely wrote off the man that raised her and now only recognizes her new found family. So definitely do not wait until she\u2019s in her twenties lol.\n\nThe second situation is with my niece, her father gave up rights when she was two, my brother has raised her as his own ever since. My SIL went through great lengths to cover this up to her, including blocking out his side of the family that she promised could still be allowed in her life (because they were a major part of her early life). They told her around 14ish. She is a very closed in/emotionally blank child so her reaction was like \u201cokay\u201d and it hasn\u2019t been discussed ever since. \n\nI think you should go with what you feel is best. Telling her too early can cause confusion, telling her too late can lead to resentment. I think the best approach is to bring a third party family therapist to coordinate this discussion so your daughter can receive therapy to navigate this situation.", "The only thing that makes YTA is what you said.

Who knows what would have happened if you had not stepped up. Your sister should be thanking you. At the same time your sister has a swamp of yucky emotions that need to be dealt with in a therapeutic setting.\n\nShe gave birth to a little girl that she has to watch be raised by someone else that is in her family. That is a hard pill to swallow. Trust me I know. I know how your sister feels. With getting the help she needs, the situation should be easier to handle.

If you give up your child for adoption in general, then you know you don't have any rights to it anymore, it's gone basically.

People often forget depression isn't just being cronically sad, sometimes it is the absence of any feeling and just being not there. Nobody can make a decision like that and if they really were to make a custody battle out of this, a good lawyer sure could say that OPs sister wasn't in the state to make an agreement like that and that she was in no stste to sign her custody away.\nOf course all this isn't about OP or her sister though. This is about the child. And they should talk about whst is best for the child.

Making a legal battle out of this will probably hurt the child much more even if it stays with one of the sisters permanently afterwards.", "Regret for the past is one thing. But the way she is behaving currently does not show emotional development. She and the SO show no signs of understanding or caring about the child's emotional needs, only their own. If they are in pain about choosing to give up their child, that is understandable but they need to deal with that in therapy not by dismantling the stable home life of a vulnerable young child. Being pissy about not getting their way in this is childish and selfish. They need to deal with their feelings more appropriately, and should not be around the child anymore until they've done the work of learning how to prioritize her needs over theirs. Especially, unfortunately, now that they have been this hope that if they can make her like them more then they eventually will get what they want.

Because thefe isn't anything stupid or petty or mean going on. There is only two sides seeing on child as their own and noone wants to let go because it would hurt so much.

Smaller the age, lesser the explanation and they wouldn't need to even give legitimate reasons anyway. \n\nIt's the brightest hope to get their dream of happily ever after, despite their irresponsibility before and now that the worst is over - the late nights, critical vaccine appointments, feeding and everything, they want to make sure to arrest the control back just because they feel some comfort. Not everyone is cut out to live life with discomfort and yet triumph. OP has shown she can do it better because it's good for the child - the bigger picture here. Anything that compromises that vision is meaningless and would be disrespectful to how OP stepped up when needed. \n\nReligious indoctrination too starts at this age, so a lot easier to brainwash and dumbdown or even erase OP's contribution at this age, than at say 12.", "It\u2019s extremely selfish to sign your rights away to your child to your sister, have her raise her as her own child and then go actually you can only be an aunt.

This is not a question of age. They can't brainwash a 12 year old that easily, compared to a 3 year old. Religious indoctrination too starts at that age, so erasing or dampening OP's role in daughter's life is extremely easy and that's exactly what will happen if OP allows the slightest leeway here.\n\nNow that the child has started speaking and recognizes and remembers people, they know this is their gap to have that chance at a sparkly marriage they actually dreamed of, and since the major troubles are over, they wouldn't mind brushing aside OP's timely actions over time and probably blame everything on to the 'situation' and brush it off to her as something you wouldn't understand till you're 18. And there goes all common sense - following in their parents mistakes. \n\nNonsense carrying over generations. OP has taken the stand when needed and will at least guide their daughter to be a real and humane person, not someone who decides after 6 months they can't handle the pressure. Let recession get worse and if they lose jobs, they'll be back to OP with requests for babysitting, taking her to vaccines and what not.\n\nThere is no moral issue as far as OP is concerned, not so much for the sister.

She's treating it like she rehomed a dog and now wants her pet back.", "They gave up parental rights and that child was adopted legally into a new family unit.

Instead of being grateful that niece has a loving and healthy home within her own extended family rather than strangers she's throwing a fit and calling take backs like a child. \n\nOP keep your eye out on your sister. Her motivations do not seem to be rooted in altruism whatsoever.  It seems as though she's always been driven by her own desires. Don't get me wrong,  I think she made the right choice in giving her DD up. I just don't think she was thinking of her daughter when she made that choice but rather was thinking about what was best for herself and she is still doing so. Good luck to you op.

One of my best friends went through this at this exact age; hearing his story was absolutely heartbreaking. OP\u2019s sister is only focused on her own feelings, and may be hoping that getting her daughter back would edit undo the fallout with friends and family. \n\nNTA, OP. You need a lawyer and supervised visits. Additionally, you need to disabuse of her the notion that your child will be living with her at any point. It seems like you were trying to soften the blow/hold out some hope, but that\u2019s not beneficial here (for anyone). She may try to alienate your child, tell her the truth about her bio parents, put her own life on hold, etc. She needs to understand and accept that this is a closed case. She\u2019s 21 and doesn\u2019t even have a fully developed frontal lobe, yet. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s doing this to be awful, it sounds like she\u2019s still incredibly emotionally immature and would legitimately be a bad choice as a parent at this time.

That is not a great way to express the desire to be a parent once again.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Precisely, and not to mention the 21 year old sister only THINKS she and her SO will be good parents.

Who\u2019s to say they won\u2019t do it again?", "That\u2019s how I ended up with my adoptive family. Bio mom was 16 when she had me. She was also a runaway but moved back to her mom\u2019s after I was born. It appears her intent was to have her mom actually do the hard part of raising me while she just treated me as a live baby doll when she was in the mood. Problem with that was her younger sister had a stroke, so her mom spent all of her time taking care of her. By the time the stepdad called social services for her neglect of me (3 months old), I had infections in both eyes, both ears, & pneumonia. My foster parents had to rush me to the ER the first night they had me. But they fell in love with me, so it broke their hearts when they were forced to give me back to bio mom. She literally took me for 4 hours, then brought me back to them & left. My dad was like, nope, we are not playing this game, so he got attorneys for them, me, & her and had them all sit down to discuss my best interests. He said she\u2019d have to take me back permanently or terminate her rights so they could adopt me. She didn\u2019t want that responsibility, so she agreed. Then they had to fight the state to get the adoption approved as foster parents were not allowed to adopt at the time. \n\nAnd no, they didn\u2019t pressure her into it. She was already pregnant with my half-sister by the time my adoption was finalized. She then abandoned her in the hospital after birth because my sister had a congenital heart defect (that wound up perfectly fine). \n\nBeing a parent is not about giving birth, it\u2019s about putting in the hard work that is raising a child and putting that child\u2019s best interests FIRST. The sole unselfish thing my bio mom ever did her entire life was to terminate her rights to me (she never did with my sister, though our grandfather & his wife raised her), and she only did that because my dad pushed it & her mom pushed her to do so as well. Some people just don\u2019t recognize exactly how much work that is. \n\nThis sister was given every opportunity not to terminate her rights, but chose to do so. Now she wants to upend a child\u2019s entire existence for her own selfish interests. She is most definitely not capable of being a better parent now than she was 3 years ago. If she was, she would never have asked this.", "This conversation would NOT be happening if OP was completely non-related to the bio parents. \n\nIf this was a complete stranger family they adopted their child to (and did not see on any regular or family-type basis), they would NOT be trying to take the child back after 3 years. \n\nNTA. OP stepped up as loving parents and siblings when most would not. They've taken this child into their home and clearly given them love and a second life. Most kids in this situation do NOT end up as fortunate.\n\nChild is lucky to have such loving parents. Bio parents are selfish and only considering themselves.", "Agreed. She is not also appreciating the fact that if her sister had not stepped up, she would never have seen that child again.  NTA", "This kid has only known one set of parents since she was 6 months old, long before she\u2019d ever remember anything else. The bio mother thinking she can do take backsies now, with a 3-4 year old child who absolutely will remember, is so selfish. If she loves this child she\u2019ll do what\u2019s best for her and be a supportive and loving aunt in her life while letting her stay with the only parents she\u2019s ever known. But she\u2019s thinking about herself, not the child. \n\nIt\u2019s disgustingly selfish, frankly. I have sympathy for her back when she made the decision to give her child up, that\u2019s never an easy decision, but no sympathy now. If she got her way she\u2019d only harm the kid mentally, and she seems perfectly willing to do that.", "At this point, it\u2019s not about what\u2019s best for OPs sister.
