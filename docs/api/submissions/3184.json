My sister (F29) has a dog that she says her world revolves around. Which is fine, she can do her thing. I just have an issue when it affects me. It is a breed that sheds a lot. Like she regularly has dog hair on her clothes. I don't eat food at/from my sisters house. I've found dog hair in her cooking before so I gently pass on her dishes. Privately I have told my mom that I don't like her dog around food and I won't eat my sisters dishes.\n\nWe were supposed to have thanksgiving at my parents house, Neither my sister or I live at our parents anymore. I arrive a little early to offer to help and see my sister was already their. Well I walk in and see my sisters dog is at my moms house. I've never been at my moms house when my sisters dog is their. Well I also found out my sister had been their all day helping my mom cook. Apparently she had offered a few days earlier and my mom accepted. I didn't know this was happening. Next thing I know the dog is trotting through the kitchen. This whole situation was too much and I told them I wouldn't be eating this food. They ask why, I tell them why. My sister says i'm blowing things out of proportion. Mentions lots of people eat food prepared where dogs are nearby. I tell her i'm not one of those people.\n\nI just decide to go home. I leave the pies I made and ended up ordering chinese. When dinner was supposed to happen my phone was blowing up and I was told I should have just dealt with it by multiple family members.

I don't think those Thanksgiving dishes were covered in dog hair after a few hours of the dog being there.", "NTA it\u2019s not like you rubbed their noses in it it made them pick out the dog hairs. They know the dog makes you uncomfortable, and you left. If you were being dramatic or controlling, you would\u2019ve stayed to argue.", "NTA. I\u2019d say NAH, but then blowing up your phone is really offensive. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to share a space with the dog, that\u2019s your choice and tbh I would\u2019ve done the same. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay for them to harass you so that you can submit to their will.", "NTA and dog hair is gross. If your sister is covered in dog hair, it\u2019s in her clothes and definitely on her sleeves, which end up in the food. If the dog is permitted in the kitchen, you know she was alternating between petting the dog, feeding the dog scraps, which is unhygienic.\n\nI guess she doesn\u2019t regularly brush the dog, which would tamp down on the amount of flying puffs of fur, which means she\u2019s become blind to the amount of dog hair in her life.\n\nI\u2019m with you, I wouldn\u2019t eat her food either, and wouldn\u2019t have stayed to eat a dinner she had helped prepare. \n\nSo sorry you are dealing with this.", "YTA", "NTA. I love my dogs, but I also know not everyone does. Your Mother and sister knew this and decided to accommodate the furry member of the family over you. There is a time and a place.", "YTA but only for your failure to communicate. \n\n1) You're approaching the this as if your stance is common  and therefore your family was being unreasonable. There are 69 million dog owners and 45 million cat owners in the US, most all of whom eat food prepared around pets. Most people would refuse to eat food in a home where pets were licking off the dishes but most people would not refuse to eat food in a home where a dog was present\n\n2) You absolutely have the right to have an atypical stance on eating around dogs but because it's atypical, you'll need to take the lead on communicating it. \n\n3) To avoid being an asshole you need to explain the extent of your aversion and ask for their support. I would use terms like phobia, as what you are describing falls into that level of severity. \n\n4) Your family relationships will do better if you own up to having an unusual and very strong phobia against eating around pets. Ask your mom and sister if they are open to accommodating you, rather than suggesting that they're unhygienic beasts and you'll be more likely to preserve your family relationships.", "Nope. Thanksgiving r for family not dog.", "NTA - I'm probably the equivalent of your sister with a dog that not everybody likes. If we aren't away for too long, we always leave our dog at home (can her dog be left? Does it have separation anxiety?). The dog clearly makes you feel uncomfortable and should be put away. Particularly if you're worried about hygeine. If we are away for longer we would bring a pen and put the dog locked in a room.\n\nIs this from a fear? Or more of a hygeine point of view? It's unrealistic to feel you will never have to see this dog as your sister is part of your life, but there are definitely ways to minimize interaction if you can. Perhaps if it's not fear based you could agree to be in the same room as it in small amounts to start provided the dog is on a lead and doesn't approach you?", "NTA - your mom at least knew full well how you felt about the dog and could have easily asked your sister to keep him out of the kitchen while the food was being prepared. She didn't, and of course once you said something, YOU'RE the one out of line. I hate to tell your sister that while there are a lot of people who eat food prepared with dogs around, there are just as many who won't, and shedding is a big reason why.. some people don't seem to understand that loose fur can fly off VERY easily, and it floats through the air until it lands - be it in food, a nearby surface, etc. Not to mention the fact that it's just plain unhygienic.\n\nMy sister moved in with us a few months ago and she has a cat who, while I love him - he's actually my icon lol - he sheds ALL the time. You can't pet him without getting loose fur on your fingers. I have to grit my teeth and bear it while he's on the couches and in the bathroom and stuff, but I draw the line at the kitchen. I refuse to eat food with fur in it, and while she did protest a little, she understands now that he needs to stay out. I would be SO mad if she pulled what your sister did.. your sister needs to learn that just because her life revolves around this dog doesn't mean everyone else's has to, and honestly, kudos to you for refusing to tolerate it. Let that be a lesson to them in the future.", "Yta. I am absolutely not a dog fan but unless they were wiping their utensils on his Butt, I think you're being pretty dramatic", "NAH. You would prefer to not share space w/ a dog. Now you can clearly communicate that to anyone who might be affected by your boundary. You have to be clear on your needs and express them if you want people to create a comfortable space for you.", "NTA. I have dogs. I love dogs. They are generally not allowed in the kitchen, particularly when I'm making food. Lots of people may eat food prepared where dogs are nearby, but that doesn't mean the dogs were running around in the kitchen shedding everywhere including the food. They don't eat food with HAIR (of any animal) it. Keep in mind that is something that could easily and swiftly get any place where food is made shut down, temporarily or permanently depending on the number of times such complaints get filed. You dealt with it by choosing to go home. Your family are AHs for telling you that. Your mom is an AH for not telling you your sister was going to be helping with the dog running around when she KNOWS your problem. Your sister is an AH for acting like it doesn't matter and everyone should just eat her dog's sheddings and not taking into account SAFE food prep habits. Tell your family this (politely) and that at least you left the pies you SAFELY made, as you could have just taken them home with you.", "Umm you could have ordered Chinese and ate it with your family if you weren't comfortable eating the food they prepared. YTA.", "NTA.\n\nDogs inside the house are disgusting, especially in the kitchen.", "NTA.", "Nta!! All these people saying you are would surely be the one demanding a manager if any type of hair was found in their food! I have 5 cats and 2 dogs. Anytime I cook, cats get locked up in a super large kennel, dogs are trained to stay out of the kitchen/eating area. Counters get wiped down, my hair goes up, hands get washed. Then cook. If you worked fast food or any food industry where you ever had to serve food and didnt keep these habits from it, that's gross. Hair of any kind in food is unsanitary.", "You definitely could have handled yourself better. Remember whose house you're standing in before you rise up in righteous indignation.", "NTA\n\nyou don't like dogs. your whole family knows you don't like dogs.\n\nwhy do so many people try to force something a person doesn't like on them? i don't like green beans, but when i go visit with family they all used to try to serve me dishes with green beans in them. like jesus fucking christ, people find out you don't like something and it's like they get some psychological condition triggered in their brains that tells them they MUST force the thing you hate onto you at every opportunity. it took my family years to realize that no, i just don't like green beans and i ain't never gonna like green beans. but i'm 40 now and a damn good cook and i just don't eat a dish with green beans in it(except for that green bean casserole made with cream of mushroom soup, but everybody likes that. gotta be the MSG or something)\n\nyou aren't the asshole. you don't like dogs, simple as. you removed yourself from the situation. you have that right, and they can stfu.", "NTA. Dogs don\u2019t belong in kitchens. At all. Food handling certificate course says so", "YTA - that is really extreme to not eat food because a dog was nearby when it was made? Maybe you have some personal aspects that have created this level of issue, but your family clearly didn't know that. If you'd just arrived and asked the dog to be put outside you'd  be N T A but the food thing is dramatic as.", "NTA sounds like your sister has a messy house and the dog is not properly groomed either. I totally get it and you shouldn\u2019t have to put up with the dog mess.", "\nA few dogs hairs won't kill you. But if previous dishes made around the dog have been absolutely covered in hair then i see the issue. Animals aren't allowed in restaurants for a reason. So if your grossed out by the smallest piece of hair then yes i would say youre being pretty dramatic. Especially since you didn't even bother to see the food or at least try it or check it out. Your sisters living space may be possibly smaller thus dog hair is more compact and floats around everywhere easier. Thus, this could be the opposite if your mom lives in a wider space or home. However, if this is just a load of hair everywhere, then i would say that you are being pretty reasonable. However, dog hair builds up over time before it gets out of control or covers the house so spending one day when the dog is in a clean house for 1 day is not gonna kill you. So although i am leaning towards everyone elses side, i dont know the actual amount of dog hair that disgusts you and that is being dealt with so i would say ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
