My sister (F29) has a dog that she says her world revolves around. Which is fine, she can do her thing. I just have an issue when it affects me. It is a breed that sheds a lot. Like she regularly has dog hair on her clothes. I don't eat food at/from my sisters house. I've found dog hair in her cooking before so I gently pass on her dishes.

I arrive a little early to offer to help and see my sister was already their. Well I walk in and see my sisters dog is at my moms house. I've never been at my moms house when my sisters dog is their. Well I also found out my sister had been their all day helping my mom cook. Apparently she had offered a few days earlier and my mom accepted. I didn't know this was happening. Next thing I know the dog is trotting through the kitchen. This whole situation was too much and I told them I wouldn't be eating this food. They ask why, I tell them why. My sister says i'm blowing things out of proportion. Mentions lots of people eat food prepared where dogs are nearby. I tell her i'm not one of those people.\n\nI just decide to go home. I leave the pies I made and ended up ordering chinese. When dinner was supposed to happen my phone was blowing up and I was told I should have just dealt with it by multiple family members. So AITA?\n\nEdit: woke up to this blowing up a bit. I've found dog hair in multiple dishes over the last few year.    This is not a one time thing. I've avoided my sisters food for about the 6-8 months because of this.\n\n2nd edit: the number of \"dog people\" messaging me hateful things is absurd because I don't like dogs and am not \"okay\" with eating dog hair.

I\u2019d say NAH, but then blowing up your phone is really offensive. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to share a space with the dog, that\u2019s your choice and tbh I would\u2019ve done the same. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay for them to harass you so that you can submit to their will.", "NTA and dog hair is gross. If your sister is covered in dog hair, it\u2019s in her clothes and definitely on her sleeves, which end up in the food. If the dog is permitted in the kitchen, you know she was alternating between petting the dog, feeding the dog scraps, which is unhygienic.\n\nI guess she doesn\u2019t regularly brush the dog, which would tamp down on the amount of flying puffs of fur, which means she\u2019s become blind to the amount of dog hair in her life.\n\nI\u2019m with you, I wouldn\u2019t eat her food either, and wouldn\u2019t have stayed to eat a dinner she had helped prepare. \n\nSo sorry you are dealing with this.", "YTA", "NTA. I love my dogs, but I also know not everyone does. Your Mother and sister knew this and decided to accommodate the furry member of the family over you. There is a time and a place.", "YTA but only for your failure to communicate. \n\n1) You're approaching the this as if your stance is common  and therefore your family was being unreasonable. There are 69 million dog owners and 45 million cat owners in the US, most all of whom eat food prepared around pets. Most people would refuse to eat food in a home where pets were licking off the dishes but most people would not refuse to eat food in a home where a dog was present\n\n2) You absolutely have the right to have an atypical stance on eating around dogs but because it's atypical, you'll need to take the lead on communicating it. \n\n3) To avoid being an asshole you need to explain the extent of your aversion and ask for their support. I would use terms like phobia, as what you are describing falls into that level of severity. \n\n4) Your family relationships will do better if you own up to having an unusual and very strong phobia against eating around pets. Ask your mom and sister if they are open to accommodating you, rather than suggesting that they're unhygienic beasts and you'll be more likely to preserve your family relationships.", "Nope. Thanksgiving r for family not dog.", "NTA - I'm probably the equivalent of your sister with a dog that not everybody likes. If we aren't away for too long, we always leave our dog at home (can her dog be left? Does it have separation anxiety?). The dog clearly makes you feel uncomfortable and should be put away. Particularly if you're worried about hygeine. If we are away for longer we would bring a pen and put the dog locked in a room.\n\nIs this from a fear? Or more of a hygeine point of view? It's unrealistic to feel you will never have to see this dog as your sister is part of your life, but there are definitely ways to minimize interaction if you can. Perhaps if it's not fear based you could agree to be in the same room as it in small amounts to start provided the dog is on a lead and doesn't approach you?", "NTA - your mom at least knew full well how you felt about the dog and could have easily asked your sister to keep him out of the kitchen while the food was being prepared. She didn't, and of course once you said something, YOU'RE the one out of line. I hate to tell your sister that while there are a lot of people who eat food prepared with dogs around, there are just as many who won't, and shedding is a big reason why.. some people don't seem to understand that loose fur can fly off VERY easily, and it floats through the air until it lands - be it in food, a nearby surface, etc. Not to mention the fact that it's just plain unhygienic.\n\nMy sister moved in with us a few months ago and she has a cat who, while I love him - he's actually my icon lol - he sheds ALL the time. You can't pet him without getting loose fur on your fingers. I have to grit my teeth and bear it while he's on the couches and in the bathroom and stuff, but I draw the line at the kitchen. I refuse to eat food with fur in it, and while she did protest a little, she understands now that he needs to stay out. I would be SO mad if she pulled what your sister did.. your sister needs to learn that just because her life revolves around this dog doesn't mean everyone else's has to, and honestly, kudos to you for refusing to tolerate it. Let that be a lesson to them in the future.", "Yta. I am absolutely not a dog fan but unless they were wiping their utensils on his Butt, I think you're being pretty dramatic", "NAH.

They are generally not allowed in the kitchen, particularly when I'm making food. Lots of people may eat food prepared where dogs are nearby, but that doesn't mean the dogs were running around in the kitchen shedding everywhere including the food. They don't eat food with HAIR (of any animal) it. Keep in mind that is something that could easily and swiftly get any place where food is made shut down, temporarily or permanently depending on the number of times such complaints get filed.

Your sister is an AH for acting like it doesn't matter and everyone should just eat her dog's sheddings and not taking into account SAFE food prep habits.

Dogs don\u2019t belong in kitchens. At all. Food handling certificate course says so", "YTA - that is really extreme to not eat food because a dog was nearby when it was made? Maybe you have some personal aspects that have created this level of issue, but your family clearly didn't know that. If you'd just arrived and asked the dog to be put outside you'd  be N T A but the food thing is dramatic as.", "NTA sounds like your sister has a messy house and the dog is not properly groomed either. I totally get it and you shouldn\u2019t have to put up with the dog mess.\n\nEDIT: thanks everyone for all the votes. We have three dogs and we just keep things cleaned up. I\u2019m definitely not hating on fur babies, it\u2019s just all about personal comfort. For instance some people sleep with their pets, I do not. Still love them all the same but they have their comfy beds. Peace and love everyone\u2764\ufe0f", "\nA few dogs hairs won't kill you. But if previous dishes made around the dog have been absolutely covered in hair then i see the issue. Animals aren't allowed in restaurants for a reason. So if your grossed out by the smallest piece of hair then yes i would say youre being pretty dramatic. Especially since you didn't even bother to see the food or at least try it or check it out. Your sisters living space may be possibly smaller thus dog hair is more compact and floats around everywhere easier. Thus, this could be the opposite if your mom lives in a wider space or home. However, if this is just a load of hair everywhere, then i would say that you are being pretty reasonable. However, dog hair builds up over time before it gets out of control or covers the house so spending one day when the dog is in a clean house for 1 day is not gonna kill you. So although i am leaning towards everyone elses side, i dont know the actual amount of dog hair that disgusts you and that is being dealt with so i would say ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m the kind of person who regularly finds a strand of fur in my food. I also have to lint roll my clothing before leaving the house every day (why the heck do washers/dryers not do a better job of removing fur\u2026). My pets are my life. I am definitely the person who would not mind a stray pet hair in my food.\n\nThat being said- you are not me. So I tried to relate this aversion to something of my own. I\u2019m vegan. And it has hurt me multiple times to go to family gatherings and have nothing to eat. Its very hurtful when I have to order takeout and eat that while the rest of my family has a delicious meal. Thankfully my family has gotten better with this; last thanksgiving, they used beyond meat in the shepherds pie so I could have some. Christmas they made me some frozen vegan pizza rolls lol. This thanksgiving, due to circumstances, it was smaller and I was part of the cooking so everything (minus the turkey lol) was vegan. And no one even noticed since that only involved using vegan butter as a substitute. It was THAT easy.\n\nAnyways. Trying to relate my experience to yours. If I showed up to a family party where they specifically made food I had a voluntary restriction on, with nothing I could eat at all, it\u2019d be pretty hurtful. And thats what they did to you. Thanksgiving, at least in my family, is about making everyone happy and welcomed.

My fluffy cat was nearly tripping us all day while we cooked. If one of his furs made it into the food, I would not be bothered. But if I knew someone eating the food had a huge aversion to that, I\u2019d definitely have locked him in the bedroom while we cooked. \n\nI also understand you didn\u2019t expect your sister to be there first, so its not something you could have predicted.

Like others have said, its not an aversion thats super common to have at this severity. So it probably didn\u2019t even occur to your mom to discuss. I can\u2019t really call her TA for that.\n\nUltimately, you reacted in the best way you could have. Maybe staying but ordering chinese would have been better, maybe it would have caused additional drama? I have no idea. But I can\u2019t fault how you reacted. It doesn\u2019t seem like anyone acted in an abnormal way, or in an asshole way. Your mom didn\u2019t realize the severity of your aversion. Your sister had no idea.

Human hair is almost constantly in growth phase (called anagen), meaning the hair follicle cells have a high rate of division to produce the growing hair. Dogs (and tbh most other mammals) cycle through the stages (growth/anagen --- transition/catagen --- resting/telogen --- shedding/exogen) and therefore have a longer or more obvious period of time when they appear to be losing their coat. Fun fact, this is also why humans lose their hair when undergoing chemotherapy and dogs don't, as the drugs used target cells with a high rate of division. \n\nThe other thing is that human hair follicles each produce only one hair (Edit: did some more research and seems to be more like 2-3 hairs), whereas dog hair follicles have one central hair (\"guard\" hair) and 3-15 smaller secondary hairs surrounding this.  So often when brushed the more delicate secondary hairs are stripped but the more hardy guard hairs remain in place. This follicle structure also allows for seasonal changes in the fur coat. The summer coat has shorter, thicker guard hairs and fewer secondary hairs to allow air movement through the fur and assist cooling, and the winter coat has longer, finer guard hairs and more secondary hairs in order to trap a layer of air next to the skin for insulation. \n\nSource: I'm a vet \ud83d\ude42\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much everybody for the awards!

I think you lack empathy so thats about as good as it can get. Its not your fault necessarily but your delusions of superiority will give you loneliness and unhappiness.

You'd think with their neck length that giraffes would have more bones, but they also have 7 - just much larger bones!\n\nSpeaking of giraffes, if they were to drink a cup of tea, it would actually be tepid, borderline cold, by the time it reached the stomach.\n\nGoing back to vertebrae, owls have 14 cervical vertebrae instead of our 7, which is what enables them to turn their heads 270\u00b0!\n\nOwls need to be able to turn their heads 270\u00b0 because they have such large eyeballs that if they were able to just look left and right with eye movement like we do, the muscle movement involved would likely put so much pressure on the brain that it would actually kill them.\n\nOwls' eye colour denotes the time of day that they hunt. Yellow eyes = diurnal/hunt during the day, black eyes = nocturnal/hunt at night, and orange eyes = crepuscular/hunt at dawn and dusk. This is about the amount of light they need to be able to absorb - a black eyed owl hunting during the day would basically be blinded. \n\nTawny owls have asymmetrical ears; one dorsally (nearer the top of the head) and one ventrally (nearer the chin), which enables them to hear both predators approaching from above and prey from below.\n\nAnother animal which is both predator and prey is the domestic cat. They have differently shaped ears from their larger wild counterparts in order to funnel sound from all directions, whereas lions for example have rounded ears designed only to listen for prey in the direction they are facing.\n\nWombats don't have kneecaps. And they are the only animal to poop cubes - the elasticity of their intestines shapes the poop just before the anus.

Lmao", "Lol, you just need more sleep.", "I work with a lot of different children with a lot of different allergies. If a parent (or the child) tells me there's an allergy, I believe them. I know how hard it has been for me with a couple of really common allergies and people telling me it's not that bad, it's all in my head, or I'm just making it up. I just make accommodation in the best way possible. With the child I'm referring to, I suggested to her mom that I change before going into the house because the child's allergy to pet dander is so bad, and the mom suggested I change in the front bathroom (one the child does not use) rather than changing in my car. It only added about five minutes to when I need to be there for our sessions, so it ultimately worked out pretty well.", ":) That is awesome!  I'm grateful my asthma is much more stable now, but I still react to dander.  Cat dander on a sweater?  I've had allergy attacks, itchy eyes, hives, sneezing, on a school bus next to someone who I did not notice was literally covered in dog or cat hair.   I noticed when I was miserable, but sheesh.  Thanks for your response; I am just now finding stuff in Reddit.  LOL  Always a learning experience!", "Nta.

Why did she have to bring a dog to a dinner? The dogs not going to sit at the table with everyone so just leave it at home...It's a PET not a person.", "So many pet people are unhygienic and label anyone who calls them out as a \"germaphobe\". This is why I just dont eat food from others. I have owned several pets and have a career in animal caretaking. I have n-e-v-e-r served guests food with animal hair in it. Even after coming home from working with dogs all day (covered in hair) I cant imagine letting dog hair get into the food that I cook because I change my clothes and shower first thing when getting home + Ive always kept my personal pets bathed and brushed. I have a cat who sheds a lot. I have had her for several months and one time I found a piece of her hair on my breakfast bread. One time. One piece of hair. It grossed me out lol.  \nPeople are so nasty.  \nOP is NTA", "I had a Maine Coon for 12 & a half years. I don't recall ever having cat hair in my food. I've lived with dogs though also and their hair was everywhere. So disgusting!!!!!", "Woah, I need to Google this!", "Holy crap yeah, and a triple coat. Good luck to him!", ">You're approaching the this as if your stance is common  and therefore your family was being unreasonable\n\nNot wanting to eat hair ***is*** a common stance. It's why hair nets and health codes exist. I mean, I have cats and sometimes I get hair in my food from them and I don't care, but I would *never* expect that of anyone else. Especially if I'm cooking for others I take extra care", "For the most part I agree. I just feel like compromise needs to happen on both sides and people need to be reasonable. If your\u2026 preferences include something that borders on being outside socially accepted preferences and require everyone to bend over backwards to accommodate than we are going to need to find some middle ground. You can\u2019t just demand people make big drastic sacrifices. If I couldn\u2019t bring my dog to my parents house for thanksgiving I\u2019d have to spend $650 bucks to keep him in boarding. I\u2019d also miss him terribly and spend the whole holiday feeling terrible at the thought of him alone and scared. I\u2019d heavily consider not attending. Now if my parents asked me to put my dog in the back yard while dinner was prepared and eaten OK\u2026 that\u2019s doable. So my point is there\u2019s limits and everyone\u2019s allowed to have preferences but if we all had everything exactly the way we liked it we would never visit our relatives ever.", "Even then once is enough.", "You\u2019re not wrong \ud83e\udd23", "she didn\u2019t say once lol, this comment is ridiculous", "Wow, the number of people upvoting this comment baffles me. Refusing to eat around animals where hair is floating around is \u201cNOT\u201d atypical behavior. I have a dog, but he is not allowed in the kitchen or around our food when we are eating. I don\u2019t know anyone who would choose to eat around a dog that would shake and possibly get hair in their food. This is just bizarre to me. Not to mention nasty. Just because you don\u2019t mind this does not mean that everyone else is abnormal. I love my dog but he is still just a dog. Some people just have a weird relationship with their dogs.", "What in god\u2019s name are you talking about? I have two Maine Coons and two bulldogs \u2014 needless to say, hair abounds. But if I frequently discovered their hair in my own cooking, I would be disgusted; if my guests did so, I would be mortified. \n\nDiagnosing a stranger with a phobia b/c they do not want dog hair in their food is the most Reddit thing to ever Reddit.", "Nta It's not a phobia, nor should it have to be, to not want to eat dog hair. There are lots of people who do not like to eat around pets. Just because you do it doesn't make it typical, that's your norm. I consider it pretty weird and gross all of the people who have no problem with finding dog hair in your food and being okay with it. I have three dogs I absolutely love but they have their place and the kitchen ain't it. They will sit right outside but not come in. To each their own though", "I would, kids are gross. I watch my niblings put fingers in mouths and noses, pick things off the floor, their sweet parents have them wash their hands before dinner, only for them to grab the toy they\u2019ve been dragging through the yard all day so it could sit at the table with them. Kid I love you but if you stick your finger in my potatoes I\u2019m not eating them, and if my family tries to tell me to eat them anyways I\u2019m just gonna leave.\n\nShe didn\u2019t throw a tantrum, she stated why she was uncomfortable, was told she was overreacting, and that invalidation caused her to leave. That\u2019s a pretty reasonable process. NTA", "What are you on about.Maybe true that particle of dog hair everywhere and it will got on a food but this is mostly about perception dog hair on food made me gross. Even if it is a dog allowed cafe if my napolitan has a visible dog hair/human hair on it I will ask for a return and no decent resturant refuesd this request. It is a common practice.", "You have pretty good points but with how OP explains it, it's not a one rime thing with a single hair. The dog that OP was talking about is always losing a lot of hair and it gets into the food wich is pretty nasty. People dont comb their hair next to where food is cooked for the same reason(hair in food is nasty) so I would say OP is NTA because their sister could have at least kept the dog away from the kitchen while cooking.", "ESH \n\nThis looks like a failure to communicate. Your family knows you don\u2019t like dogs. People should always ask everyone before bringing pets and respect boundaries when being told no", "This is probably unpopular but ESH. \n\nYou\u2019re being dramatic and she isn\u2019t being conscious of her animal\u2019s hair. I have a dog and two cats and know they shed. If I\u2019m hosting people or making food for others I first clean my kitchen (minimum wiping off areas and vacuuming) and change into a clean shirt. I\u2019d be so mortified if someone found hairs in my cooking. However, your aversion is pretty extreme and because of that you not communicating it has let it go on without any solution. Maybe she honestly didn\u2019t realize. Or maybe you saying \u2018oof I found a hair in this\u2019 would embarrass her a bit into being more conscious of when she cooks. Use your words with your sister.", "YTA.  You are an a-hole because you left . . . not because you expressed your opinion about the dog . . . dog hair and eating food in that environment.  You made the holiday all about the food, leaving out the importance of sharing your time with your loved ones.  You ended up getting Chinese food and going home alone.  Your other option could have been to tell your family that you would stay for dinner, but would have to run out and get something you were comfortable eating with them.  If they went nuts on that, then at least it was them forcing your hand on leaving . . . and not you making that decision without exploring other options.", "YTA it is okay to have boundaries but you sound incredibly dramatic and immature. It is your mom\u2019s house, not yours, and leaving just due to the presence of a dog is pretty ridiculous. If you are really that concerned about the food just order takeout. But you are the one with the issue here so you need to accomodate yourself. Sounds like the hair thing happened just once and, while gross, is not that big of a deal.\n\nEdit: reading the responses really shows how detached reddit\u2019s hivemind can be from reality. YES boundaries are reasonable but you are still gonna look asshole in these cases! Everyone saying how disgusting it is to have a dog in the kitchen. Have you ever spent time outside of your own house? Most dog owners keep the dog food and bowls in the kitchen. Get a grip.", "I wouldn't go so far as to say YTA but it sounds like you're going to have a hard time in the future if you're not willing to be in social situations that aren't exactly as you want them.\nYour mom and your sister are definitely not the asshole here.\n\nSounds like you were at someone else's house (your mom's) whose decision it is on who is present, and she was ok with the dog being there. You simply can't expect every situation in your life to cater to your specific desires/needs - keep in mind the concept of preparing yourself for the path vs preparing the path for you. \n\nThis is not your home. If it was your home and the dog was brought against your will, you would 100% be within your rights to ask them to leave. However your mom has every right to invite whomever she chooses - human or non - and you need to sometimes accept that you will be in situations that aren't 100% up to your standards. If you want to leave, that's up to you but you're going to miss out on a lot of stuff if you maintain this standard in life. I recommend finding a way to adjust and be more flexible or you're going to be very disappointed when not everyone accommodates your wishes on every single event.", "YTA. Why ditch your family? You could have politely explained the situation and ordered food at their home. Saying it\u2019s nothing against them but just to handle your own aversion. Better than ditching them", "I went to visit my family, but a dog was in the kitchen so I left. YTA.", "I think leaving was dramatic. Yes a big part about thanksgiving is the food but it\u2019s also about spending time with family. I don\u2019t understand why you couldn\u2019t have hung out with everyone for a while then go home and eat.", "YTA Because Thanksgiving is about more than food. You didn\u2019t have to leave in a huff. You could have sat there and nicely visited with your folks. Who are obviously advanced enough in age that they now need help to get dinner on the table. Even though they were perfectly fine last year, (I\u2019m guessing) people change. Your parents are getting older. They asked your sister to help them and she did. \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to eat the food. You could have stuck to the dishes your folks prepared. Taken food and pushed it around on your plate. There are lots of things you could have done but your insistence on being right ruined the holiday for everyone. \n\nYour parents might not even be here next year. This could have been your last chance to spend the holiday with them. \n\nIs this really the hill you want to die on?", "I find OP perspective on what equates to \"proper care\" subject because she's clearly not a pet owner. I groom my dog 2 times a month and then brush her every day and hair still finds itself everywhere. Nothing ends the shedding so idk how true that statement is.", "I have a question about this if you don\u2019t mind. If you do mind, then you can just ignore this question. I\u2019ve heard that yorkies have hair that is more similar to human hair than other breeds dog fur. Does that mean that a yorkies fur is similar to our growing phase, or do they have the same growing phase as the other dogs still? I am curious as I heard that yorkies have similar hair to humans and I have one, and when their fur is long, it does seem to brush similar to ours (not when it\u2019s short though unless it\u2019s by the face/head). Thank you for taking the time to read this. :) Animal facts fascinate me.", "I just need you to post animal facts on here now please."]}
