My sister (F29) has a dog that she says her world revolves around. Which is fine, she can do her thing. I just have an issue when it affects me. It is a breed that sheds a lot. Like she regularly has dog hair on her clothes. I don't eat food at/from my sisters house. I've found dog hair in her cooking before so I gently pass on her dishes. Privately I have told my mom that I don't like her dog around food and I won't eat my sisters dishes.\n\nWe were supposed to have thanksgiving at my parents house, Neither my sister or I live at our parents anymore. I arrive a little early to offer to help and see my sister was already their. Well I walk in and see my sisters dog is at my moms house. I've never been at my moms house when my sisters dog is their. Well I also found out my sister had been their all day helping my mom cook. Apparently she had offered a few days earlier and my mom accepted. I didn't know this was happening. Next thing I know the dog is trotting through the kitchen. This whole situation was too much and I told them I wouldn't be eating this food. They ask why, I tell them why. My sister says i'm blowing things out of proportion. Mentions lots of people eat food prepared where dogs are nearby. I tell her i'm not one of those people.\n\nI just decide to go home. I leave the pies I made and ended up ordering chinese. When dinner was supposed to happen my phone was blowing up and I was told I should have just dealt with it by multiple family members.

I\u2019d say NAH, but then blowing up your phone is really offensive. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to share a space with the dog, that\u2019s your choice and tbh I would\u2019ve done the same. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay for them to harass you so that you can submit to their will.", "NTA and dog hair is gross. If your sister is covered in dog hair, it\u2019s in her clothes and definitely on her sleeves, which end up in the food. If the dog is permitted in the kitchen, you know she was alternating between petting the dog, feeding the dog scraps, which is unhygienic.\n\nI guess she doesn\u2019t regularly brush the dog, which would tamp down on the amount of flying puffs of fur, which means she\u2019s become blind to the amount of dog hair in her life.\n\nI\u2019m with you, I wouldn\u2019t eat her food either, and wouldn\u2019t have stayed to eat a dinner she had helped prepare. \n\nSo sorry you are dealing with this.", "YTA", "NTA. I love my dogs, but I also know not everyone does. Your Mother and sister knew this and decided to accommodate the furry member of the family over you. There is a time and a place.", "YTA but only for your failure to communicate. \n\n1) You're approaching the this as if your stance is common  and therefore your family was being unreasonable. There are 69 million dog owners and 45 million cat owners in the US, most all of whom eat food prepared around pets. Most people would refuse to eat food in a home where pets were licking off the dishes but most people would not refuse to eat food in a home where a dog was present\n\n2) You absolutely have the right to have an atypical stance on eating around dogs but because it's atypical, you'll need to take the lead on communicating it. \n\n3) To avoid being an asshole you need to explain the extent of your aversion and ask for their support. I would use terms like phobia, as what you are describing falls into that level of severity. \n\n4) Your family relationships will do better if you own up to having an unusual and very strong phobia against eating around pets. Ask your mom and sister if they are open to accommodating you, rather than suggesting that they're unhygienic beasts and you'll be more likely to preserve your family relationships.", "Nope. Thanksgiving r for family not dog.", "NTA - I'm probably the equivalent of your sister with a dog that not everybody likes. If we aren't away for too long, we always leave our dog at home (can her dog be left? Does it have separation anxiety?). The dog clearly makes you feel uncomfortable and should be put away. Particularly if you're worried about hygeine. If we are away for longer we would bring a pen and put the dog locked in a room.\n\nIs this from a fear? Or more of a hygeine point of view? It's unrealistic to feel you will never have to see this dog as your sister is part of your life, but there are definitely ways to minimize interaction if you can. Perhaps if it's not fear based you could agree to be in the same room as it in small amounts to start provided the dog is on a lead and doesn't approach you?", "NTA - your mom at least knew full well how you felt about the dog and could have easily asked your sister to keep him out of the kitchen while the food was being prepared. She didn't, and of course once you said something, YOU'RE the one out of line. I hate to tell your sister that while there are a lot of people who eat food prepared with dogs around, there are just as many who won't, and shedding is a big reason why.. some people don't seem to understand that loose fur can fly off VERY easily, and it floats through the air until it lands - be it in food, a nearby surface, etc. Not to mention the fact that it's just plain unhygienic.\n\nMy sister moved in with us a few months ago and she has a cat who, while I love him - he's actually my icon lol - he sheds ALL the time. You can't pet him without getting loose fur on your fingers. I have to grit my teeth and bear it while he's on the couches and in the bathroom and stuff, but I draw the line at the kitchen. I refuse to eat food with fur in it, and while she did protest a little, she understands now that he needs to stay out. I would be SO mad if she pulled what your sister did.. your sister needs to learn that just because her life revolves around this dog doesn't mean everyone else's has to, and honestly, kudos to you for refusing to tolerate it. Let that be a lesson to them in the future.", "Yta. I am absolutely not a dog fan but unless they were wiping their utensils on his Butt, I think you're being pretty dramatic", "NAH.

You have to be clear on your needs and express them if you want people to create a comfortable space for you.", "NTA. I have dogs. I love dogs. They are generally not allowed in the kitchen, particularly when I'm making food. Lots of people may eat food prepared where dogs are nearby, but that doesn't mean the dogs were running around in the kitchen shedding everywhere including the food. They don't eat food with HAIR (of any animal) it. Keep in mind that is something that could easily and swiftly get any place where food is made shut down, temporarily or permanently depending on the number of times such complaints get filed. You dealt with it by choosing to go home. Your family are AHs for telling you that. Your mom is an AH for not telling you your sister was going to be helping with the dog running around when she KNOWS your problem. Your sister is an AH for acting like it doesn't matter and everyone should just eat her dog's sheddings and not taking into account SAFE food prep habits.

All these people saying you are would surely be the one demanding a manager if any type of hair was found in their food! I have 5 cats and 2 dogs.

If you worked fast food or any food industry where you ever had to serve food and didnt keep these habits from it, that's gross.

Maybe you have some personal aspects that have created this level of issue, but your family clearly didn't know that. If you'd just arrived and asked the dog to be put outside you'd  be N T A but the food thing is dramatic as.", "NTA sounds like your sister has a messy house and the dog is not properly groomed either. I totally get it and you shouldn\u2019t have to put up with the dog mess.", "\nA few dogs hairs won't kill you. But if previous dishes made around the dog have been absolutely covered in hair then i see the issue. Animals aren't allowed in restaurants for a reason. So if your grossed out by the smallest piece of hair then yes i would say youre being pretty dramatic. Especially since you didn't even bother to see the food or at least try it or check it out. Your sisters living space may be possibly smaller thus dog hair is more compact and floats around everywhere easier. Thus, this could be the opposite if your mom lives in a wider space or home. However, if this is just a load of hair everywhere, then i would say that you are being pretty reasonable. However, dog hair builds up over time before it gets out of control or covers the house so spending one day when the dog is in a clean house for 1 day is not gonna kill you. So although i am leaning towards everyone elses side, i dont know the actual amount of dog hair that disgusts you and that is being dealt with so i would say ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m the kind of person who regularly finds a strand of fur in my food. I also have to lint roll my clothing before leaving the house every day (why the heck do washers/dryers not do a better job of removing fur\u2026). My pets are my life. I am definitely the person who would not mind a stray pet hair in my food.\n\nThat being said- you are not me. So I tried to relate this aversion to something of my own. I\u2019m vegan. And it has hurt me multiple times to go to family gatherings and have nothing to eat. Its very hurtful when I have to order takeout and eat that while the rest of my family has a delicious meal. Thankfully my family has gotten better with this; last thanksgiving, they used beyond meat in the shepherds pie so I could have some. Christmas they made me some frozen vegan pizza rolls lol. This thanksgiving, due to circumstances, it was smaller and I was part of the cooking so everything (minus the turkey lol) was vegan. And no one even noticed since that only involved using vegan butter as a substitute. It was THAT easy.\n\nAnyways. Trying to relate my experience to yours. If I showed up to a family party where they specifically made food I had a voluntary restriction on, with nothing I could eat at all, it\u2019d be pretty hurtful. And thats what they did to you. Thanksgiving, at least in my family, is about making everyone happy and welcomed. So only making food you can\u2019t eat is like a big middle finger.\n\nThe only reason I\u2019m leaning NAH instead of NTA is that your sister wasn\u2019t told about the fact you won\u2019t eat food made with her dog around. I know its not really something\u2026 fun to talk about. But I think its something she wouldn\u2019t just instinctually know. Because like I said, I\u2019m an animal person too. My fluffy cat was nearly tripping us all day while we cooked. If one of his furs made it into the food, I would not be bothered. But if I knew someone eating the food had a huge aversion to that, I\u2019d definitely have locked him in the bedroom while we cooked. \n\nI also understand you didn\u2019t expect your sister to be there first, so its not something you could have predicted. The only person here who could have saved the situation is your mom, but I can\u2019t blame her if she didn\u2019t realize the severity of your aversion. Like others have said, its not an aversion thats super common to have at this severity. So it probably didn\u2019t even occur to your mom to discuss. I can\u2019t really call her TA for that.\n\nUltimately, you reacted in the best way you could have. Maybe staying but ordering chinese would have been better, maybe it would have caused additional drama? I have no idea. But I can\u2019t fault how you reacted. It doesn\u2019t seem like anyone acted in an abnormal way, or in an asshole way. Your mom didn\u2019t realize the severity of your aversion. Your sister had no idea.

Human hair is almost constantly in growth phase (called anagen), meaning the hair follicle cells have a high rate of division to produce the growing hair. Dogs (and tbh most other mammals) cycle through the stages (growth/anagen --- transition/catagen --- resting/telogen --- shedding/exogen) and therefore have a longer or more obvious period of time when they appear to be losing their coat. Fun fact, this is also why humans lose their hair when undergoing chemotherapy and dogs don't, as the drugs used target cells with a high rate of division. \n\nThe other thing is that human hair follicles each produce only one hair, whereas dog hair follicles have one central hair (\"guard\" hair) and 3-15 smaller secondary hairs surrounding this.  So often when brushed the more delicate secondary hairs are stripped but the more hardy guard hairs remain in place. This follicle structure also allows for seasonal changes in the fur coat. The summer coat has shorter, thicker guard hairs and fewer secondary hairs to allow air movement through the fur and assist cooling, and the winter coat has longer, finer guard hairs and more secondary hairs in order to trap a layer of air next to the skin for insulation. \n\nSource: I'm a vet \ud83d\ude42", "It's because they're mainly shedding their undercoat. Not all of their fur/hair. Some dogs have double coat, some triple coat. What they're shedding is the insulating layer close to the skin. Equivalent to down in ducks and geese.

It's startling the difference in behaviour when the objects they feel they have to protect are not present. \n\nWe often end up with anxious animals who particularly fear the vet visits, so we work with them via \"desensitisation\" sessions (literally me sitting on the floor giving them lots of treats until we're friends and then I'm able to build up to examining them) and a lot of owners find it very surprising that this works better without them in the room for this exact reason. It's very much case by case but if a dog is guarding something/ someone then the stress hormone levels are likely to be high enough that training or behavioral modification such as desensitisation will have very little effect. Basically sometimes you just need neutral territory - my preferred method is taking them into the practice garden without the owner, as it's a new area for them without any negative associations, usually less threatening as it's not enclosed, and nothing to guard. \n\nHope this helps!
