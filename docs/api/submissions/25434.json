My feeling is that public places (even the gym) don\u2019t come with the expectation of privacy, but I still understand that with some social media jerks, sometimes annoying shit like that really does happen.\n\nI think as long as both parties are respectful and assume best intentions, then there\u2019s no asshole behavior.", "Soft ESH - she should have asked you, or at least told you, that she was filming before she started.

I used to be a member at a CrossFit gym, and thankfully, it was a smaller group of us during the 5 AM class (and no mirror walls). There was always one guy who constantly filmed himself PRing his back squats, deadlifts, and any random WOD happening on any given day.

I make myself small I make sure I\u2019m tucked away and if there is any chance someone is in the shot I don\u2019t film that exercise. I don\u2019t film every set, I don\u2019t film every exercise, and most of the time I just ask my boyfriend if he\u2019s there to film one set so I can be the only one in it.

Wouldn't go to a gym that lets folks film and snap pics unless it's a specific spot for some pose/progress pictures", "At the very least, you should ask permission from people who might end up in the shot PRIOR to filming, AND you should explain what it\u2019s being used for (I hate being filmed but if I knew beforehand it was just a private video to send to a trainer, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be okay it, for example).  This should be basic etiquette.", "There is a good reason to film yourself in the gym sometimes. It\u2019s so you can check your own form. When your form is off, it can be hard to feel the problem.

I don\u2019t think that was misogynistic, I just don\u2019t like it when people are too preoccupied with their Instagram pages.

She is not free to do whatever she wants.", "Joey swoll is a bully, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right", "Some gyms have a policy not to film though. Also legality does not equate morality and general etiquette.", "Yes, this is nice.

Everybody already understands this \"argument\" as to why some people want to film themselves in the gym. We still think it shouldn't be allowed.", "BS I started working out in 1987 and we didn't need filming", "Nope, not valid enough reason to film in the gym.  Check your form in the mirror or just figure it oot.", "I think there\u2019s an implication that the OP saw a woman filming at the gym and immediately assumed it was for Instagram, which could indicate some gender bias. Tons of guys post insta thirst traps as well, though. It would have just been better for OP to leave that comment out.", "Hell yeah, love the introspection! Not an AH in my view, OP.", "There was nothing misogynistic about that comment don't worry.\n\nWomen aren't the only people who use Instagram.", "I didn\u2019t get misogynist vibes from your post either, plenty of men film when they\u2019re not supposed to, be it instagram, TikTok, etc. It\u2019s just a generational thing. You were maybe not right to make a comment about Instagram, but you\u2019re not the AH for expecting people to at least ask your permission to film you at the gym.", "Men and women both do it, lmao. Misogynistic is definitely not the correct term here. Either way, you're NTA. I HATE being filmed and would've done the same thing. You can either go to a secluded area or ask those around you before filming. It's a matter of respect for those around you.", "Tbh the Instagram comment can be seen like as asshole material but I can also see it as a way of catching her in a lie if it was one", "You don't, really, though I would probably know. Nobody where I lift is dressed or made up like an Instagram model. It would really, really stick out.\n\nThat, too, really changes with the gym.", "lmao the person you are replying to is not one i would be listening too. they are either biased or ignorant to the situation. \u201cJUST MOVE\u201d is a hilarious answer. they probably record themselves/others in the gym all the time. \n\nit is not okay to record others in the gym\n\nit\u2019s a growing trend to record yourself and non-coincidentally others in the gym. \n\nshe is the asshole for not apologizing and moving the view of the camera. it\u2019s not your duty to move due to somebody else\u2019s lack of awareness.\n\nNTA", "Exactly. Public is public. you can do that on the streets too.", "If there\u2019s no enforcement of a no filming policy at the gym then she\u2019s free to record her training wether it\u2019s for instagram likes her personal trainer or to make money.", "If it\u2019s not against gym policy she sure is allowed to do whatever the hell she wants.", "I find that lady annoying. No one should move because she wants to film and she makes it an entire production.", "It's very common nowadays to work with a trainer you never even meet in person. Times change.", "so then it has nothing to do with gender or misogyny. If a man was filming him he would have said the same thing. Why else would people film in a gym if not for social media clout?", "Right, that was kinda my point. I get why there might be that immediate reaction, because misogynistic dudes will for sure treat women like they\u2019re generally more vain than men, and could say the exact comment as OP with this specific intention\n\nBut given the possibility that OP could be saying that comment *without* this specific intention, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to automatically assume that misogyny played any part in his comment", "That is absolutely true. But it still doesn't make OP T-A for asking not to be filmed. That's a very reasonable request.", "Filming people in public is acceptable and tolerated in America.  I'm not sure a gym, with a membership restriction would fall into that category.   I'd discuss it with management asap.", "There also was a dude lifting weights and filming himself doing it. My first assumption was he also did it for Instagram. He also dropped the weight after every push, and everyone around him couldn\u2019t help but look at the source of the noise. If he wanted attention, he sure got it.", "Acceptable, yes.  Tolerated, not so much.  I don't think people should be able to film others if they don't want to be unless there is some sort of safety concern or filming for proof of an event etc.  So many people now instigate and cause issues intentionally just to rile someone up to get a viral post."]}
