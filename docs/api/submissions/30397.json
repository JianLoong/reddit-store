{"id": 30397, "submission_id": "17omwf7", "title": "AITA for ignoring my grandmothers request to reconcile with my bio dad, her only child.", "selftext": "Context :\n\nMy mom (19f) had a one night stand with my bio-dad (27m) who I\u2019ll call Terry and ended up pregnant with me. They were never together as a couple. \n\nWhen I was 10, Terry sued my mom for custody to make up for his \u201cprecious\u201d lost time. The judge granted him 1 year to make up for lost time, but my mom would retain sole custody after. \n\nWe did not know when Terry would come to collect me, just knew that it would and could happen any day. I was at school when he showed up with a sheriff in tow to yank me from school. Mind you, he wasn\u2019t on an authorized list and know one knew who he was. The school did NOT notify my mother. At this point, I\u2019m in tears having a full blown meltdown. He takes me to my dentist office to get my records, they don\u2019t know who he is and the secretary was very concerned because of the state I was in. She called my mother after we left and my mother was able to meet me at the drs office as he was headed there next. That was the last time I saw my mom for an entire year, crying in the drs office parking lot, had the secretary not called her I wouldn\u2019t have been able to say goodbye in person. Terry did not allow me to gather any of my personal belongings. I left the state with my school bag and the clothes I wore that day. \n\nI was 10 years old, with a 7 pm bed time, not allowed to have friends over or go see them. For nearly a year I was basically held hostage. Prior to this, Terry had always been a huge d*ck and so wasn\u2019t his wife Paula. One trip to Paula\u2019s family house for Christmas, I caught pneumonia and was extremely sick. So sick, that I couldn\u2019t open my Christmas presents because I was bedridden with a fever of 102. Because I couldn\u2019t physically get up to open my gifts, Terry threw them away because I was \u201cungrateful\u201d. \n\nAt the end of my 5th grade year, Terry shipped me off to my grandmothers in another state where I spent the remainder of my time before heading home to my mothers.\n\nStarting my 6th grade year at the middle school which had kids from multiple towns, I was known as the girl who got kidnapped, because that\u2019s basically what happened..but legally. Luckily it didn\u2019t stick past the first few weeks once it wore off that I was back. \n\nThat Christmas, Terry terminated his rights. You guessed it, he put me through all of that sh*t just to turn around and terminate his rights. Though, we knew the real reason was because with his raise he would have to pay more in child support and he didn\u2019t want to pay. My mom and I were ecstatic that it was finally over. \n\nMy grandmother, Terrys mother, was extremely disappointed and appalled by his actions and did not speak to him until I was 16. My mother and grandmother had a good relationship, as my mom did not want me to lose my grandparents and I spent summers there after. \n\nWhen I was 16, my grandmother reconciled with Terry, and wanted me to too. I decided to give it a trial run, and he pretended like nothing ever happened. When he saw me for the first time, all he could say was I\u2019d gained weight. Of course I had. From ages 11-16 people generally fill out. I was still skinny, I just had curves and b00bs. \n\nI did not opt to stay in contact as I still have not forgiven him. My grandmother on the other hand, still wants us to reconcile and for the past 12 years since I was 16, has brought it up. Terry and Paula have kids now, twins. That my grandmother forced me to meet when I was 18, I do not consider them my siblings and never will. \n\nI saw Terry last year for my great grandmothers funeral and he attempted to be Buddy Buddy with me. I shrugged him off and cozied up with my grandpa who understands my dislike for his stepson. The priest asked me if I was Terrys daughter, and I responded \u201cNo, I\u2019m Ann\u2019s granddaughter\u201d it confused him since she only had the one child, Terry. \n\nSometime after the funeral, Terry asked my grandmother to ask me if I was okay with telling the twins I was their sister, and asked how he should explain it to them. I responded don\u2019t, they don\u2019t have a sister and never will. I\u2019m not his daughter, and if he wants to explain the situation to them, he can, but I won\u2019t be a part of the family. \n\nMy grandmother still calls them my siblings despite me saying they aren\u2019t. I have sisters from my mom, and those are the only siblings I will ever count. My grandmother rolls her eyes and tells me I need to forgive him, but I would rather eat glass than do that. \n\nSo, AITA for not reconciling when she asks?", "created_utc": 1699221509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17omwf7/aita_for_ignoring_my_grandmothers_request_to/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
