If you're not close to them, they will definitely understand not being invited to something that only has 30 guests. \n\nAlso, good for you for staying independent. Your mom likely feels that there is some shade from others on her for not paying for the wedding, since traditionally it was the bride's family that covers costs. She's being old-fashioned. Explain to her that people who work in the wedding industry are VERY familiar with having the couple pay for themselves, and that it is zero reflection on her. \n\nEnjoy your wedding!", "NTA.

Thankfully, my ex and I were on the same page about this.  We did not add those people to the guest list, but compromised by letting his mom send out wedding announcements instead.  Knowing she was like that, we decided to pay for most of the wedding ourselves.  My mother only contributed to the cost of the catering, and only because I knew she would not try to interfere.\n\nIf you are paying for the wedding, do it the way you want.  Your mother is not in control of the guest list.  It's on her to uninvite those 3 friends, by saying that the wedding is going to be very small, and the venue can't accommodate more people.\n\nYou know your parents best.

But I feel like a lot of people on Reddit don't have enough appreciation for their parents and everything they have done to bring them up. People always advise posters to do what's right for them, never mind their family. Weddings are just a little bit for your parents too, so maybe you should give her this. And accept enough money to cover her friend's places and no more, so she doesn't have any extra leverage. That said, 30 people does sound pretty intimate, so I wouldn't blame you for sticking to your guns either. I am just suggesting another opinion that I hope you consider.

NTA.  If your mother wants her friends at a wedding, she can have one herself.", "NTA.  Your scenario is exactly why my now wife and me paid for our wedding ourselves. I've seen what goes down in my (Italian) family when you take the money. You basically lose all the control and it's not about you anymore.\n\nEDIT:  and yes we caught shit for not taking the money. But stood our ground and it went away eventually.", "NTA I wish I did this and heavily regret giving into awful pressures that come w having a \u201ctraditional\u201d wedding. Wish I did what ur doing and stayed true to ourselves. One of my biggest regrets", "This is why OP should take it upon herself to tell those people in no uncertain terms that they aren\u2019t invited. It wouldn\u2019t matter who invited me to a wedding if one half of the couple told me I wasn\u2019t welcome I wouldn\u2019t show up.", "When my FMIL brought up inviting old family members she know can\u2019t make it just because \u201cthey\u2019re family, they\u2019ll send a good gift.\u201d I shut her down and told her that was a sleazy and disgusting thing to do, and told her I would absolutely not be sending invitations just because we *might* get a gift. She did not have a happy look on her face, but she hasn\u2019t brought it up again.\n\nI like the wedding announcement compromise. I might tell her she can send wedding announcements, since I thought sending save the dates would be tacky when not accompanied by a later invite. \n\nFMIL tried to volunteer paying for a bar when she knew we didn\u2019t want one. I had to make it clear it wasn\u2019t a budget thing, we just have no interest in having alcohol there. My dad has volunteered to get cake for us to cut since we\u2019ll have a chefs dessert table. My nana will do mine and my MOH hair as a gift, but other than that the whole shebang is on us.", "Tell her if she doesn\u2019t stop she won\u2019t be invited either.", "I think that would be an insta uninvite from me too.", "NTA, this is your day not hers, you invited the people you want there. Stand your ground.", "NTA you should have the wedding and the guests that you want, especially because you are paying yourselves.  If she is embarrassed that she hast to take back her verbal invitation, she can simply tell them you chose a very small venue with a very limited guest list. If your mom wants to pay for a fancy party and invite her friends, tell her to throw herself a birthday or anniversary party of her own.", "Tell her she either accepts that it\u2019s your wedding and it will be the way you and your fianc\u00e9 want it or not to attend.", "NTA", "NTA   Stand your ground.", "This. It took me years to stand up to my mum, but once I did, the ridiculous, petty, immature manipulations mostly stopped. A quick reminder is needed every once in a blue moon, but she steps back in line real quick these days!", "Yup. I was fortunate enough to have parents who paid for my wedding and respected that all we wanted was a small wedding. They didn't give a dang about impressing people.", "NTA", "Your NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts your wedding the one day that is supposed to be about you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have friends who recently got married and are not doing all that well, they are currently in marriage counselling. The strife? Well MIL insisted on planning most of the wedding and making choices the bride specifically hated but felt she had to go along with because the Inlaws are loaded and paid for the wedding. She only has her mother who raised her as a single parent and always struggled financially. As much as she was grateful she also became resentful over time as her special day became all about the MIL and what the MIL envisioned. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe admitted to me the night before the wedding, crying her eyes out, that she wished they had just eloped and that she felt like this wedding was about everyone else BUT them. That resentment has trickled into their marriage sadly.", "NTA don\u2019t do it. My best friend accepted money and then accepted the fact her wedding really wasn\u2019t going to be what she wanted after her mom took over (arguments about the first dance song, wedding favors, layout of the venue, whether to have a program or not). It\u2019ll start with this request and then balloon to other aspect of the wedding.", "NTA. Your wedding (that you're paying for) Your rules. She had no right to invite virtual strangers to your wedding. She's the one that needs to suck it up & tell her friends NO. Also, obey & apologize?? For what, exactly? Your mom is the one who thought that she could take over your wedding. That again, you are paying for. Not her.", "NTA your wedding, your choice. It\u2019s absolutely that simple.", "Honestly I would *hope* that if I'd been invited to a wedding but one or both of the people getting married didn't actually want me there and the invitation was actually coming from a parent or another relative against their wishes, that someone would tell me. I'd much prefer a slightly awkward conversation to inadvertently causing stress on someone's wedding day!", "NTA: It\u2019s a small wedding, she has no business making demands. Remind her it\u2019s your wedding not hers, and she already had her moment.\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t being pushy about those three friends, I\u2019d bite the bullet, swallow any pride I may have, and take the check. But there\u2019s no point doing that here unless she\u2019s willing to drop the three friends issue.", "NTA. Your mom is a major boundary-stomper; good for you and your fianc\u00e9 for standing your ground.", "NTA\n\nAsk Mom for the telephone numbers of the three friends she invited so you can call to tell them she overstepped her boundaries. Tell aunt to say the word \u201cobey\u201d one more time and she won\u2019t get an invitation.", "NTA.  Tell Mom she can take her friends out to the theater if she needs to entertain them.", "NTA your wedding and it\u2019s so small that only people that you and your fianc\u00e9 invited should be there. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of other people you\u2019d rather have than friends of your mom that you don\u2019t even know", "Not at all.  It's your wedding, your choice.  Tell your family to back off, and if they don't, disinvite them. Don't feel guilty. \n\nNTA", "Your son and daughter won\u2019t be at your wedding? Bizarre", "Sounds like someone is resentful that they have no power in this wedding, so they have to look down on it and OP to be less butthurt about it.", "Like someone else mentioned you may have to uninvite your mother, aunts and anyone else who is trying to bully you about what and who to have on your wedding day.  Please also stop including your mother to dress shopping or she\u2019ll ruin that also.\n\nThey are absolutely disrespectful of your boundaries. If you bend once to your mother\u2019s requests you will keep bending and you\u2019ll have footed the bill to have your day taken from you.\n\nOr you can remain firm and go through with your day as planned or elope.", "The mom will continue to be a problem especially if a baby comes in the picture. OP may want to go NC for good, the mom is manipulative.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a reunion for your mom\u2019s friends\u2014-it\u2019s your wedding.", "NTA. Your wedding, your guests, not hers. If she wants to have a \"wedding party\" for her friends, she can organize one at her house and invite them. You don't have to attend.", "NTA. She requires training.", "NTA. You are, apparently, the only grown a$$ adult in your family!\n\n1. You are handling mom perfectly. (\"No. End of discussion.\")\n2. To bro: \"It is one very important day in MY life. It is not about mom or her friends. Also, mom is boat rocker. You can spend your life trying to keep the boat stable for mom. That's not a job I signed up for. (See endless internet explanations about boat rockers and how they influence their loved ones.) End of discussion.\"\n3. To aunts: \"I am an independent, mature adult. I don't 'obey' another person. I can respect their boundaries for their lives; I expect them to respect my boundaries for my life. End of discussion.\"", "My parents gave us a monetary gift, but prefaced that it was a *gift*. So I asked what they wanted final say on - guest list, ceremony, catering, etc. before accepting. They swore up and down it was a *gift* and ~no strings attached~ and so we accepted. Fast forward a few months, they don\u2019t like our choice and start to bring up their *gift* to which I\u2019m like \u201cok bet. We\u2019ll give it all back\u201d and they shut up very fast about that. Never brought up their *gift* again because they know I\u2019d follow through with it. \n\nOur only regret with the wedding? Where we compromised with my parents to give them what they wanted. Don\u2019t do it, OP. It\u2019s not worth it."]}
