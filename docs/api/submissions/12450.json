We decided to keep it small and simple, with only 30 guests. This includes our parents, siblings (who are also the wedding party) plus a few very close friends. We decided to have a child-free wedding, so no ring bearer and flower girls. The rings are with the best man. As to the expenses, we--that is, fianc\u00e9 and I--are paying.\n\nMy mom is on my case saying we should invite three of her  friends who wanted to attend because she mentioned that I'm getting married and she invited them (verbally, and without telling me). I said no because (1) I'm not that close to them (2) Fianc\u00e9 and I want a small wedding.\n\nMom offered to pay for the wedding, but fianc\u00e9 and I said no, because we don't want to open ourselves to a difficult situation like \"well, I'm paying for your wedding so I get to do X.\" Now she's been calling us and leaving remarks whenever we are with other people. \"Come on, just three people, I'm paying anyway/ I'm your mother, why can't you do me a small favor.\"\n\nI've stopped talking to her whenever she brings that up no matter where we are. If we are with people. I just go \"Mom no. We talked about this. End of story.\" My brother says I should just suck it up because it's for one day and I'm not interacting with the ladies anyway. My aunts said I should obey and apologize.\n\nI think I'm the A for being firm about not inviting the ladies and for refusing my parents' money.

Nothing outrageous happened but it wasn't a party and it was the worst day of my life.", "Absolutely NTA. It's your wedding, and she had no right to extend those invitations in the first place. Stick to your boundaries. And tell your brother that since it *is* just one day, you want it to be the day you planned.", "NTA. \n\nYou are doing exactly what so many other AITA posters SHOULD do when they come on here and make posts complaining about their parents trying to control their wedding, only to then reveal that their parents are the ones footing the bill. \n\nThat being said, you might want to at least keep in mind that your mom may well decide to have them \"crash\" the wedding if you don't invite them. Hopefully it doesn't come to that, but since she seems *very* insistent on this and unwilling to take \"no\" for a final answer, it does make me wonder. \n\nIn any case, you are entitled to the wedding YOU want to have, especially as you're the ones paying for it. Congratulations!", "NTA\n\nYour brother & aunts need to stay out of it. Not their business at all. \n\nYour mom was out of line to invite people to an event that isn't hers. Now she's likely going to feel embarrassed having to uninvite them, but too bad. Play games, win prizes.\n\nShe needs to uninvite her friends, and you need to give her a deadline to get it done, or do it yourself. If you're not close to them, they will definitely understand not being invited to something that only has 30 guests. \n\nAlso, good for you for staying independent. Your mom likely feels that there is some shade from others on her for not paying for the wedding, since traditionally it was the bride's family that covers costs. She's being old-fashioned. Explain to her that people who work in the wedding industry are VERY familiar with having the couple pay for themselves, and that it is zero reflection on her. \n\nEnjoy your wedding!", "NTA. It's your wedding and you made it very clear that you want a small one so it is not okay for anyone even your mom to force you to invite someone you don't want even if they would stay out of your way. It's about principle.", "NTA This is refreshing to see you all to your ideals and pay for it yourself. You will be happier in the long run", "NTA\n\nI had certain family members try this exact thing with me and my husband too, and we stood our ground and guess what, they got over it.\n\nIt is yours and your fiance's wedding, not your mother's wedding.", "NTA Obey? What are you 5yrs old? No you're a grown woman. Stand your ground. It's YOUR wedding not your mother.", "NTA.\n\nI went through this with my first husband's mother.  She wanted to invite lots of people \"who wouldn't come but would send a nice gift.\"  I refused because it felt like those people had no real connection to my ex and I felt that it would look like we were just trying to get gifts.  Thankfully, my ex and I were on the same page about this.  We did not add those people to the guest list, but compromised by letting his mom send out wedding announcements instead.  Knowing she was like that, we decided to pay for most of the wedding ourselves.  My mother only contributed to the cost of the catering, and only because I knew she would not try to interfere.\n\nIf you are paying for the wedding, do it the way you want.  Your mother is not in control of the guest list.  It's on her to uninvite those 3 friends, by saying that the wedding is going to be very small, and the venue can't accommodate more people.\n\nYou know your parents best.  If you believe that once they give you money they will try to control your wedding, you're probably correct.  Stand firm on this.", "NTA.  The wedding and reception are about you and your fianc\u00e9, not your mom.  Tell her she is welcome to use her money towards throwing her own party where she can invite anyone she likes.", "NTA. And tell your brother that it won't be just the three ladies or just the one day. What if she doesn't like the location and offers to pay for a better one? What if you have children and she shows up with lots of stuff because she doesn't like how you decorated their rooms? \n\nLike Barney Fife said, \"You've got to nip it in the bud. Nip it!\"", "NTA.  Stand firm.  It's your wedding and you're paying for it.  Whoever pays makes the rules.", "Your wedding, your choice of guests.  Sounds like your mom is used to getting her way.\n\nYou made a smart choice not accepting their money.\n\nNTA", "I was in your your position and gave in even though MIL didn't contribute a single penny.  Don't give in\n\nNTA", "My opinion is probably going to be unpopular, but I am going to say ESH. Your Mother shouldn't have invited them without checking and probably shouldn't pester you. But I feel like a lot of people on Reddit don't have enough appreciation for their parents and everything they have done to bring them up. People always advise posters to do what's right for them, never mind their family. Weddings are just a little bit for your parents too, so maybe you should give her this. And accept enough money to cover her friend's places and no more, so she doesn't have any extra leverage. That said, 30 people does sound pretty intimate, so I wouldn't blame you for sticking to your guns either. I am just suggesting another opinion that I hope you consider. If you keep saying no, at least see if there is something else you can do to make it up to her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
