We attended middle and high school together, but I wasn't in their social circles at all. I was always one of the sort of nerdy awkward kids and the two of them were both very popular. My wife in particular was extremely popular because she was (and still is) extremely beautiful, kind, and intelligent. She was our student body president and valedictorian. Jess was also very pretty (I even had a tiny crush on her back then) and similarly popular. My wife and Jess have been best friends since kindergarten.\n\nMy wife and I started dating our senior year of high school after we were paired together to complete a project in one of our classes. We realized that we got along really well, and she asked me out, and I definitely wasn't saying no to her. Jess from the very start, did not respect our relationship, and firmly believed that my wife could do much better. She has, in the decade plus since, consistently told me that my wife is out of my league, that I was lucky she settled for me so young, and that my wife belongs with a more attractive and successful man. Now, I'm the first one to admit that my wife is out of my league. She's far more attractive, makes more money, and is just generally an amazing human being, but hearing it so often doesn't exactly feel good. Jess also has tried to convince my wife to cheat on me multiple times and has even tried to set her up with other men, because she doesn't approve of my wife and I being the only sexual partners either of us have ever had.\n\nJess has a daughter \\[5F\\] whose father bailed on her and raises her as a single mom. Jess actually dropped out of med school to raise her daughter once she realized the father was not going to be in the picture. My wife and I absolutely love her daughter and love having her over. Jess had a date on Saturday night, so she left her daughter with us for the night and came to pick her up on Sunday, and stayed for lunch. As I was preparing lunch for everyone and her daughter was playing in the yard, Jess and my wife were talking about her date. Jess was going on and on about how attractive the guy was, how good he was in bed, and all of the details, but I just ignored it. Jess then looked to me and said \"You're lucky you locked her down when you were so young before she knew that there was better out there\" and then turned to my wife and offered to give the guy her number in case she wanted to \"try him out\". I got really angry at that point so I just said \"I doubt you know anything about better, since your taste in men is why you're a single mom and not a doctor right now\". Both of them just stared at me in shock, and then Jess called me an asshole and left quickly with her daughter. My wife has been upset with me since, so I have to ask. AITA?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to point out that my wife acknowledges that what Jess said was inappropriate, but thinks that what I said was unnecessarily cruel. It was always Jess's dream to be a doctor like her dad, especially after her dad passed away, and now that's probably never going to happen. Jess has said this to me before, so I was aware of it, and my wife thinks it was uncalled for to press on something that's so clearly a pressure point for her. Jess also frequently bemoans the pains of being a single mom, and about how all of the guys she goes out with ghost her as soon as she mentions her daughter. This is mainly why my wife is upset with me, because she thinks I purposely hurt Jess, while Jess's comments are a joke and aren't meant to hurt my feelings, which is probably mostly true.", "created_utc": 1681847359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r1x4i/aita_for_telling_my_wifes_friend_that_her_taste/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry,Jess and your wife are the AH.", "NTA- your wife is the biggest one . \n\nHer friend constantly belittles and is disrespectful towards your marriage and your wife is ALL GOOD.\n\nIt sounds like your wife deep down agrees with her and believes  you should be happy that she\u2019s even with you to begin with.  \n\nBoth your wife and her friend being completely shocked that you stood up for yourself tells me that she feels that you should take it because she believes her friend is right.\n\nYou deserve better OP .\n\nDo not apologize . They should be apologizing to you.", "NTA\n\nObviously Jess is a massive AH, we all know that.\n\nBut I see an ENORMOUS problem with your wife just sitting there and doing nothing at all while her friend shits on you and talks to you like you are garbage. Does she not care about you? Do your feelings not matter to her? Why doesn't she put on her big girl pants and tell Jess to fuck off?\n\nYou should stand up for yourself more, ask your wife why she just lets her friend treat you like trash. \n\nI would be LIVID if somebody said something like that to my gf. I would probably drop all contact but not before shouting them out of my house.", "Jess sucks, and is clearly an asshole, but your wife is, too. She\u2019s allowed Jess to get away with this shit, and has failed to defend you. I suspect that she actually likes it, because it gives her an ego boost. You are NTA.", "NTA - your wife friend is not a friend. Is a damage maker. In the long term, she will destroy your family.

At all. They might be mad at you and maybe I could understand why if I was your wife and had more loyalty to my friend than to my husband, but alas no.  \nYou gave brutal honesty to someone who was long overdue and honestly, your wife's friend sounds pretty trashy. You brought to light a hard truth that I'm sure she's aware of. Your wife's friend may also be a bit jealous of your wife and the life she's made with what seems like a nice person (idk you though so healthy skepticism lol).  \nI think you have more of a wife problem. What I mean by that is that your wife consistently let's her \"friend\" disrespect you and y'alls relationship. What's more is that I wouldn't put it past your wife's friend having feelings for your wife and/or you...", "Please show your wife these comments, she needs a reality check with Jess.", "Absolutely NTA", "Ordinarily ESH, mutual insults are hardly productive, however *NTA*. This woman came into you home after you and your wife watched her child so she could go on a date. She then sat in your kitchen insulted you and offered to give your wife the number of some random man so she could cheat on you. So, definitely *NTA*, don't dish it out, if you can't take. A lesson most people learn in elementary school.", "NTA\n\nIf she can't take it she shouldn't dish it out. I'd take the initiative here, if I were you. Ask your wife what her thoughts and feelings would be if one of your friends was always trying to set you up with other women. And then listen. You're not on the defensive here. You want to know her perspective. Just be patient and silent until she answers the question.", "Jess and your wife are TA in this situation. I understand you lashed out so I don\u2019t fault you got that, however your wife has allowed Jess to perpetuate this behavior of telling you in front of her that you don\u2019t deserve her and all that, your wife should have put a stop to it a long time ago because Jess does not in anyway respect your relationship. \nJess is the biggest AH in all of this, she should respect your relationship or remove herself from your lives. She needs to stop trying to wreck your relationship because you have not stopped their friendship (?) \n\nYou should have a serious conversation with your wife about your feelings when it comes up Jess and how you it affects you. Then explain how she would feel if you had a friend who put her down all the time and tried hooking you up with women in front of her, and if when you went out if he constantly urged you to cheat. Is this a friend she would like in your life? Would she put up with it? Just because the genders are reversed doesn\u2019t mean that the feelings aren\u2019t valid.", "How can your wife have such a friend? Wow. She's toxic. NTA and say it again the next she dares to comment on your relationship.", "NTA. Jess has messed up her education by chasing men. She's jealous at what you guys have and is trying to destroy your marriage. I'm not sure I'd have waited as long as you before speaking up. The truth hurts.\n\nShe's going to hate you more now though, so be prepared for her to double down on her efforts with your wife.", "NTA. Why does your wife tolerate Jess talking like this to you?", "NTA\n\nIf your wife continues to allow Jess to suggest these things to her without putting her foot down, I'm afraid sooner or later Jess will win.", "ESH\n\nSorry mate. You're allowing yourself to be a doormat. Your wife may subtly rebuke Jess every so often, but she's not being even remotely clear enough. Jess is just a pot stirrer.", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s friend is a C.", "NTA- Honestly what a disgusting friend to have to constantly shame and belittle someone like that. I would have a serious talk with your wife about this behavior her disgusting friend consistently has with you. I dont understand how and why your wife is upset at YOU for finally standing up for yourself in front of a woman who just tried an has been trying to get her to cheat in front of you. Disgusting, absolutely disgusting.", "If Jess is also not the kindest to your wife why would she want someone like that to be the godmother of her child? That doesn\u2019t make sense. I think after you have a large conversation with your wife she then needs to have one with Jess about boundaries and respect.. it sounds like Jess is jealous of your relationship and misery loves company so she does what she can to sabotage it", "NTA in the least. But you definitely need to either sit down with your wife for a very serious conversation about how her comments make you feel (especially in front of you, I couldn\u2019t imagine what she says when you\u2019re not there) and that its really hurtful even if the wife thinks she\u2019s just joking. A hurtful joke at someone\u2019s expense is still hurtful. She doesn\u2019t have to leave the friend but boundaries need to be set. Hopefully your wife comments back to her friend about how great you are in some respect or about the relationship when her friend makes those comments.", "NTA.  I\u2019m a late commenter and OP may never see this, but dude, if your wife isn\u2019t an asshole, then show her this post.  She needs to know that she is complicit in making you feel like crap.  It sounds like she is in a codependent relationship with Jess, and afraid of rocking the boat.  If she knew how much the person who disrespects HER is bothering her lifemate, perhaps she would wake up.", "NTA. Please consider showing your wife this post so she can read some comments for perspective.  \n\nThis does not seem like a healthy relationship.  Even if there are good parts, even if it spans 25+ years, true friends do not \u201cjoke\u201d continuously in this manner.", "NTA, OP. However, I would talk to your wife and ask her to make sure Jess stays in her lane moving forward.", "She comes into your house after you've done her a favour, and insults you and your relationship? Personally, if I was your wife, I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who thought it was funny to suggest I'm a cheater. Nevermind the disrespect to my partner. NTA. But your wife should stand up for you.", "NTA, but I also think now is the proper time to sit down with your wife and lay out what's going on with Jess and her impact on your relationship once things have calmed down a bit. Bring in a couple's therapist to mediate the conversation if you have to, they're not here to judge or take sides, just give you the language you need to talk to each other through difficult conflicts.\n\nMy husband and I are the same age as you and your wife, and we got together only a couple years after you. I also had toxic friends who really wore down my self-esteem and my choices and felt entitled to make comments on me, my relationship, and my job, and they deeply got to me.\n\nTalking with a therapist made me realize that they were trying to pull me onto their level to validate the choices they made. I dropped out of college because it financially didn't make sense for my degree, so the fact that I was succeeding in my career despite that made them feel bad that they spent thousands on a degree to end up not being able to afford to move out of their parents home, which is why every promotion I made had to be belittled. I picked a good man based on the quality of his character, and while I definitely find him attractive, he's not the trad big buff frat guy, but because I settled down before them as the youngest of all of them, it became \"I can't believe you settled, you could definitely pull someone hotter/richer if you waited longer\". Every facet of what they expected relationships to be and what they demanded from the people they dated was superficial and selfish, and me having a happy, healthy relationship with a man who showed up as an equal partner and supported me through every step of the way and vice versa didn't match the queenly expectations they had for being a woman in a relationship, and somehow their feelings about what they wanted not working out for them became my fault.\n\nYour wife is being weak-willed and needs boundaries if she wants Jess to stay in her life. She also needs to face the fact that there's a good chance Jess is only around because your wife makes it easy for her to start conflict and she thrives on trying to ruin your wife's happiness, which as her oldest friend, is going to be devastating for her to realize.", "> Now, I'm the first one to admit that my wife is out of my league. She's far more attractive, makes more money, and is just generally an amazing human being, but hearing it so often doesn't exactly feel good.\n\nDon't do this to yourself, man. Don't denigrate yourself because of poor self-esteem. She loves you because *you're you.* There are no leagues, don't let shitty populist sayings hurt your self-esteem. You are worth her love.\n\nOn the other hand, she needs to *show* her love for you. She can't let Jess shit all over you constantly. If she's tried telling her to back off, and Jess isn't backing off, she needs to lay boundaries that she will no longer participate in the friendship if she cannot respect you as her friend's spouse. It honestly does not matter if your wife has difficulty standing up for herself, because *she isn't standing up for herself, she's standing up for you.* Silence is compliance.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Was it below the belt? Sure.  But Jess is not hitting above it, and has been at this for basically a decade now. How is that OK?  \n\nAnd honestly, your wife is also an AH. Probably bigger than Jess. I have seen your edit and your comments, but it does not sound like she cares enough to stand up for you. And that\u2019s a problem. She is giving you crap for a SINGLE instance of you not holding your tongue. Yet not only has Jess been insulting you for over 10 years, she has actively tried to get your wife to cheat on you. Does Jess get similar treatment? Or does your wife just brush it off? Clearly, your wife knows how to show somebody close to her when she is mad, and the fact that she not only has not done this over the years with Jess when she talks about you but also has not put a full stop to it is telling. From the outside, it sounds like your wife neither loved nor respects you enough. That sounds harsh, but it\u2019s not an unreasonable conclusion to  form. You wife is great at being a good friend, but she seemingly sucks at being a good partner. You can sugarcoat it all you want by saying she is amazing in other ways (which I do not doubt), but at the heart of any relationship is respect - and letting your partner continually be disrespected by your friend in more than one way for over 10 years says very clearly that she doesn\u2019t respect you in the way that a partner should. \n\nI know your wife is getting piled on her, but I think that is justified. You may want to show her this post and the comments because she likely needs repeat reminders of why her passiveness when it comes to you is worse than anything you said to Jess. \n\nCongratulations on the baby! And just a reminder that like many decisions with your child, godparents is a two yes one no decision.", "You sure do fight to defend your wife from all these comments about here. To bad she won\u2019t do the same for you. Y T A because calling out someone\u2019s faults and insecurities is mean. You don\u2019t like when she says mean stuff about you. But ESH is my verdict. You, your wife and her friend. All a bunch of toxic people.", "ESH. Yes, even your wife. Is Jess an arsehole? Without a doubt. Were you an arsehole when you stooped to her level? Hell yes. Your wife, though... she may be this fabulous, beautiful and kind woman, but she SHOULD HAVE SHUT DOWN Jess's behaviour YEARS ago. A boundary needs to be set. If she loves you, she will NOT let you be treated this way.", "ESH. Jess was inappropriate for saying that about you to your wife, and attempting to interfere in your marriage, and your wife should have shut that nonsense down the first time it happened. It's not \"joke\" when she keeps doing it.\n\nYou knew enough about Jess's struggles to know how to really hit where it hurts, and while yes it was provoked, it wasn't called for. Partners leave for all kinds of reasons -- you weren't part of the decision or the marriage so you don't really know what her ex was thinking when he left. It wasn't right for you to assume fault in that situation.\n\nSo everyone sucks here.", "ESH. You shouldn't have insulted her like that because being a single mom is not a choice for the majority. \n\nIf I had a friend like that speaking that way to me and my spouse then we most likely wouldn't be friends anymore. I know exactly how you feel because my ex had a friend like that and they ended up getting in a physical altercation over it.\n\nThe friend sucks because you just flat out don't treat people like that", ">Now, I'm the first one to admit that my wife is out of my league.\n\n>Jess has a daughter [5F] whose father bailed on her and raises her as a single mom.

She shouldn't keep poking at you but you yourself acknowledge you're not as good as your wife could get. You're out of line for victim blaming and bringing her daughter into it while she was there.

But you wife ultimately is the one who has to make the decision of who her friend is and if it\u2019s worth it, we can have blinder when it comes to friends who have been with you basically your whole life, I know I did. My husband wasn\u2019t shy about stating his dislike but I thought it was worth it and my friend and I talked a few things out especially how some of her words affected me and vice versa and things are waaay better now. But your wife has to see it for herself, you can only point out so much", "You should suggest your wife try therapy. Her relationship ship with Jess is abusive and unhealthy. In my experience, professionals can really help people to get to realizations like that.", "Just ask your wife how she would feel if one of your friends keeps telling her \"he could do better than you\" for years, and tries to get you to have sex with other women.", "You would be surprised how many men do bail when they seemed perfect from the get go. Birth control also fails as well especially since doctors tend to not inform women what medications will cancel out birth control", "She is the victim of a dead beat, no matter how/why they separated.", "That comment just confirms that Jess is a shit-stirrer. She likes dramatics, particularly ones she gets to watch from the sidelines.", "Yeah the wife needs to see this", "My wife definitely doesn't encourage it. She does tell Jess that it's inappropriate sometimes.", "Well, I'm just repeating what Jess says.", "The guys jess is picking obviously don't.", "She needs to tell her every single time. And make it clear that while she will always be best friends with her. She needs to respect your relationship. \n\n\nHonestly, your wife should have had this talk with her a long time ago. By not stopping it, she is condoning it.\n\n\nWhat you did was wrong. However, I don't like what your wife did or best friend.\n\n\nYou need to talk with your wife asap\n\nEsh", "She\u2019s encouraging it every single time your wife doesn\u2019t tell her to pack it in and stays being friends with her. Your wife does not have your back at all.", "And that has done absolutely nothing to stop it.", "I wonder if Jess talks to her dates about trying to get her best friend to cheat on her husband.  If a date said that to me, I would never want to see them again.  It would make me think my date was manipulative and ok with cheating.  Jess may think it's because of the kid, but im guessing her attitude doesn't help."]}
