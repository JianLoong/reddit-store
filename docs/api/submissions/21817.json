I'm assuming this varies in other countries/provinces/states as well, which is why you learn the rules. \n\nAnyone who has been around alcohol for 5 minutes knows that some places are very strict when it comes to alcohol consumption, while others are the opposite.

YTA - establishments have different licences to sell as a liquor store (take out) and as a bar (drink in).  Some places have both.  If you buy take out goods you must take them out unopened.  If you buy drink in goods the bartender must open them.  At least that is here in where I live in NJ.  The bartender probably thought his license/job was at risk.", "YTA. Generally illegal to open a carry out beer in a bar. You were not served by a bartender who expected you to drink the entirety of the beverage.

The real answer to that is \"it depends on the law of your jurisdiction.\"", "NTA, but it's a common law, especially for tall boys.

Of course, this is as per the rules in my home state and the European country I worked in. It may be different from state-to-state, but that bartender was rude and unprofessional.

Beer packages to go is very obviously not for on site consumption, and they are not assholes for immediately stopping you.

To go/ take out beverages are meant to be enjoyed off premise. Not on premise. It\u2019s a completely different license breweries deal with. \n\nAll an agent would see was a brewery violating their packaging license and bar license. Customer drinking \u2018outside\u2019 beverages which are out of the control of the bar in terms of service. \n\nThere is a reason that some breweries CANNOT sell to go product directly over the bar. It has to be in a separate area that distinctly divides packaging and bar. \n\nLikely, OP was standing in the defined package area. Usually there is a defined wording on the flooring stating NO Alcohol beyond this point.", "Maybe it was a separate area, but maybe not. My local taprooms sell the drink-here and to-go beverages in the same location, at the same till. It\u2019s not uncommon to buy some cans early but they still can\u2019t be opened on-site; the two kinds of sales are kept track of when bought. And if it was a mixed location like that, that would explain why the staff confiscated the rest, since they were concerned about it happening again.\n\nIs there clear labeling at the places like that around here? Yes and no. The cans are clearly labeled for takeout. What this exactly means (that it\u2019s takeout *only*, cannot drink on premises) is not posted."]}
