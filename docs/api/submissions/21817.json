It is incredibly obvious that packs of cans are sold to go, not to be cheap by avoiding ordering draft beers AT A BREWERY.

Do that in my state, and it's a crime, and if the bartender doesn't intervene, they are also liable and can be arrested and fined thousands of dollars. No one simply protectiong their job is a prick.", "If he did what he did to op and dumped the wrong persons beer he could get his ass beat", "Where I\u2019m from when you get an alcoholic beverage to drink on the premises it has to be opened. Beverages for takeaway would not have to be opened, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to drink them there. None of this really matters because it is unlikely we are in the same place, but thought I would share.", "If they are rude and condescending about it, yes they are. He easily could have said \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry nobody told you, but you can\u2019t open that here. I\u2019m gonna have to take it from you.\u201d instead of just grabbing it and walking away.", "Yeah, he is for the way he did it. Sounds like he was a total prick.", "But like\nWhy? Why does it matter who opens it?", "That's interesting.  Now that you mention it, they do always serve the alcohol already opened where I'm from, too.  I never knew that buying sealed ones and opening on the premises wasn't allowed, but I'm gonna pay more attention now since it's probably the case here, too.", "I am not really sure. Maybe when you buy a multi-pack and then have the freedom to choose how many you drink that would be an issue. Say they would have only served you one more drink before they cut you off then you buy some beers to take home. If you start drinking those then you are drinking more than they want you to on the property. \n\nIt has to be about control of alcohol intake. Also, they probably lose money when people do this even if there is no legal reason for them to do it they would probably discourage it.", "I think to distinguish between shops and bars. They have different licences. In uk shops that sell alcohol are \"off licences\" where you can't consume on the premises. Bars where you can drink require different permissions. \n\nSo it matters if the beer your selling is open or sealed.\n\nNot quite applicable here as they have both licences but my guess is that's where it comes from.", "Probably more expensive from the bar rather than a multi pack retail sale", "Yeah, you are NTA.

The bartender can cop a huge fine and can the establishment. \n\nAnd sometime you just get fed up with peoples shit, I feel the bartender. The way you wrote this is really condescending, and maybe that how you are in real life? Hence his reaction?\n\nLet this be a lesson, NAH", "NTA. In my place of work speaking to/acting like that around a customer would get you disciplined, and rightly so that was so rude. At a minimum that should have been \"I'm terribly sorry sir but customers are only permitted to consume things sold from the bar. I'm going to have to ask you to seal that back up if you can, or we can throw it away and get you a replacement so you haven't lost money on a simple misunderstanding.\" Whether the customer is the biggest, stupidest asshole going or the loveliest person you should always be very respectful and polite.", "YTA. You bought a takeaway item, it\u2019s likely (depending upon where you\u2019re from) illegal for them to allow you to drink that in there. If you\u2019re going to drink in an establishment you need to buy what\u2019s on tap or what is kept behind the bar. Pretty common thing.", "Nta you paid for the beer there so\u2026", "YTA\n\nTakeaway is takeaway. If you were in a round with your friends, they wouldn't hand you guys a 4pk to split between you. \n\nThis is conveniently dumb.", "NTA, but there are different permits for everything with alcohol sales. Retail sales can't usually be drank on premises, draught permits are different, beer by the can for on premise, liquor by the drink, some states even sell liquor by airplane bottles (or they used to). Really stupid, but live and learn.", "Yeah you're right! If they did not want you doing that won't they have a sign?", "In Sweden, australia and some other places, opening a can of beer in the very establishment you bought it in can be grounds for fines and even revoked license.\n\nWhy is that?\n1: a beer bought from the bar in a open can or so is a legal beer and seen as such in the till for counting and taxing.\n2: the pack of beer you brought out is in their till as sold to \"the outside\".\n\nTherefore, you broke the law that you did not know about.\nNAH, but double check your local laws next time.", "No idea where you live but in Ireland or Australia that would be obvious.", "Here, it is really against the law.  And people freak the fuck out when it happens.  I've been at breweries a few times where it happens.  The people have been nice, but also very clear that if a police officer walked in and saw that, they would lose their license and their business would be shut down.  \n\n\nedit:  My friend did this and the brewery owner literally jumped the counter and ran to him.  You could see the absolute terror in his face.", "NTA I'd call my bank and get the charges reversed since I didn't get what I paid for AND HE TOOK MY PERSONAL BAG  \n\n\nactually no if he took my bag and walked off I personally would have ended up in jail lol cuz that shit is WILD to me", "Bartender is also only able to kick you out in these situations though, they can't legally take your property off you and dump it.\n\nThe rule is common but taking the beer instead of telling them to leave is still theft.", "Where?\n\nIn the UK most bars/brewery's/pubs sell cans to drink inside.\n\nI've been to places In Florida and New York that allow it as well", "It's not a rule it's a law. It's how on premise vs off premise liquor licenses work.", "I am genuinely shocked at the amount of NTA responses here and the amount of people that somehow do not know this rule/law exists.", "Because it's a law. Just like you don't see signs around tell you that you can't run red lights or drink in public.", "Nah that\u2019s very common knowledge. Kinda like how you can\u2019t just start eating your groceries inside the grocery store.", "Than that's better a situation in Europe, cause to me it's common knowledge.", "Not sure why you were downvoted, unless they replaced the beer they still committed theft, I can't imagine me or any of my mates being chill over someone taking our shit and dumping it in a sink, we would definitely be causing more damage to the place than whatever the fine would cost", "Probably the best analogy I\u2019ve heard in that regard once it\u2019s put like that. In fairness, I also don\u2019t spend much time around drinking cultures.", "That's because you haven't paid for them yet. A lot of grocery stores will let you buy a drink and then drink it while you do your purchasing.", "In fairness, I don\u2019t spend time around bars or breweries nor do many of the community of individuals I make time to be around do. So my knowledge is lacking in that.", "They can shut your establishment down completely for violating liquor laws.", "The laws for take away and the laws for in house service are different in most places. However most places can't do both or the take away part is in quite a different section so a place that does do both from the same till should have signs up about it.", "Money. ABC wants money and serving beer costs more than buying a 4pack", "The beer in the bar are probably more expensive because the people working there need to be paid.", "Your point? If they don't replace it it's still theft. You don't get to take someone else's property and dispose of it, believe it or not but bartenders aren't actually law enforcement so they don't get to just do what they want with your property."]}
