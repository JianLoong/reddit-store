I get that some places are not allowed to serve take away so they open the can first or other places sell take away so you cannot consume on premises but either way if you did not know it's a shit way to find out", "NTA. I never would have known that you can\u2019t drink beer on the premises of an establishment that sells and serves beer after buying the beer from them. There are better ways the bartender could have handled it.", "NTA, but that is an incredibly common rule. So much so that it needs not be posted. You're still new to drinking, so you didn't know, but it's a major faux pas at the least, and illegal in many places.", "INFO: what did he take away from you?", "NTA. \n\nWhat a pretentious way to run a public piss-tank.", "esh\n\nbreweries have been popular long enough that it\u2019s common knowledge that they pour you beer in glasses for there and packaged beer is to go\n\nwhy else would they price the same beer on draft differently than canned beer??\n\nthere\u2019s even contextual clues - no one else is drinking cans, they aren\u2019t serving people cans, the cans are clearly marketed as \u201cto go\u201d not \u201cfor here\u201d\n\nalso - bartenders are literally legally responsible if a customer gets drunk and hurts themselves or someone else. so\u2026can you see why it\u2019s a big deal that a customer on premises is serving themselves in such a way that the bartender can\u2019t monitor you?\n\nit\u2019s classic alcoholic/problem behavior at breweries/bars and they reacted harshly because there can be harsh consequences. \n\nso yeah - the guy could have had more tact, but you could have shown a little situational awareness\n\nit\u2019s crazy how many people ITT are acting like this is an unspoken rule at breweries", "ESH. It is incredibly obvious that packs of cans are sold to go, not to be cheap by avoiding ordering draft beers AT A BREWERY. Plus I'm pretty sure there are laws about how beer to go/for here are treated.

Anything you purchase in a closed container must remain closed and removed from the bar before opening. You can't open it on the premises. That's why bartenders always open cans and bottles before giving them to you.

No one simply protectiong their job is a prick.", "If he did what he did to op and dumped the wrong persons beer he could get his ass beat", "Where I\u2019m from when you get an alcoholic beverage to drink on the premises it has to be opened. Beverages for takeaway would not have to be opened, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to drink them there.

Why does it matter who opens it?", "That's interesting.  Now that you mention it, they do always serve the alcohol already opened where I'm from, too.  I never knew that buying sealed ones and opening on the premises wasn't allowed, but I'm gonna pay more attention now since it's probably the case here, too.", "I am not really sure. Maybe when you buy a multi-pack and then have the freedom to choose how many you drink that would be an issue. Say they would have only served you one more drink before they cut you off then you buy some beers to take home. If you start drinking those then you are drinking more than they want you to on the property. \n\nIt has to be about control of alcohol intake. Also, they probably lose money when people do this even if there is no legal reason for them to do it they would probably discourage it.", "I think to distinguish between shops and bars. They have different licences. In uk shops that sell alcohol are \"off licences\" where you can't consume on the premises. Bars where you can drink require different permissions. \n\nSo it matters if the beer your selling is open or sealed.\n\nNot quite applicable here as they have both licences but my guess is that's where it comes from.", "Probably more expensive from the bar rather than a multi pack retail sale", "Yeah, you are NTA.
