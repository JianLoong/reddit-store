I'm assuming this varies in other countries/provinces/states as well, which is why you learn the rules. \n\nAnyone who has been around alcohol for 5 minutes knows that some places are very strict when it comes to alcohol consumption, while others are the opposite.

YTA - establishments have different licences to sell as a liquor store (take out) and as a bar (drink in).  Some places have both.  If you buy take out goods you must take them out unopened.  If you buy drink in goods the bartender must open them.  At least that is here in where I live in NJ.  The bartender probably thought his license/job was at risk.", "YTA.

The real answer to that is \"it depends on the law of your jurisdiction.\"", "NTA, but it's a common law, especially for tall boys.

It's mainly due to tax and liquor licencing rules.", "The laws governing things are available to the public and you have a responsibility to inform yourself, since ignorance of the law is not a defense to breaking it.", "Telling him to leave instead of committing theft is just as viable even if it's a law", "Then put up a sign at the checkout. Shouldn't be that hard. We all know alcohol is not allowed for people under 18 and we still have the sign in every bar.", "Where I am from it's a law that you cannot buy a beer under the age of 18. Everyone knows that. There's still signs in every store/bar. The driving comparison is crap, because you need a license to drive, which implies that you learned about the laws, by law, basically. The same is not true for drinking. Just hang up a sign, no more issues.", "A simple \"Stop! You can't drink that in here!\" Would have solved this whole thing in like 5 seconds", "No but most pubs I go to don\u2019t have takeaway so this wouldn\u2019t be a common thing for me. If I went to a brewery that sold takeaway like how OP described I can understand opening a beer while waiting without really thinking about it being a rule. Personally I wouldn\u2019t have thought about it either.", "And how does that lead to them just yanking the drink out of OP's hands and dumping it? Even if they are allowed to do that, wouldn't it be much more sensible to either throw out the beer or leave?", "I've seen plenty of grocery stores allow consumption of certain goods before paying for them on the grounds that you as the consumer will indeed make sure they are paid for. I've more than once opened a drink before paying or watched several people open bags of chips to snack on before they reach the checkout", "I'm European, I have a friend who runs a pretty successful brewery, I spent quite some time there and I never heard of this. \n\nWhat we do have here is the rule that you cannot take a drink you bought inside out with you. That's fairly common knowledge and still bars will put a sign at the door to remind people. Rules have to be stated somewhere because you just cannot expect everyone to know. Just put up a sign at the checkout.", "And I'm sure you know every law", "if you think I'm gonna learn every bullshit law that applies to hundreds of different states, cities, and towns, you are out of your mind. I doubt very much that you are aware of every law that applies to every single place you visit, and would place money that you have unknowingly broken several laws yourself because of ignorance of law, so I recommend you get off your high horse.", "It matters because the law regulates bars and bottle shops differently, and you can't evade the regulation on one by pretending to be the other, and you can only be both at once (in the case of breweries that also operate bars) by following a set of constraints that prevent the different forms of sale from being mixed - like preventing patrons from drinking off-sale purchases on-prem.", "Public intoxication laws which stretch back to the prohibition era (or, more specifically, when prohibition ended but many state legislatures were still anti-drinking). Open container laws sought to stop people from drinking by limiting portable drinking options like bottles, flasks, and later cans. They couldn't punish the people drinking, but they could heavily fine or remove the liquor license from vendors.\n\nThese still exist in a lot of places under the pretense of limiting drunk driving situations, alongside the \"no buying alcohol on Sundays\" laws and the like. None of them actually solve the issue of public drunkenness', and at this point the main reason they exist (to punish vendors and stores for carrying alcohol) is largely moot.", "Most likely reasons:\n\n1. The price they sell a multipack at will be a lot cheaper than the price they serve the same beer at the bar for.\n2. The shop selling the beer probably has a license for drinking off the premises. So you can't drink it there.", "Yes they absolutely can. As long as you get a refund they can absolutely take their merchandise back. Liquor laws are incredibly stringent. No, bartenders aren't law enforcement, obviously. But they're acting so that they don't get in trouble with law enforcement. Stings are very real. I worked for a brewery that was shut down for 5 days the first week I worked there because one of the bartenders violated a liquor laws.\n\nI don't know why you think bartenders can't take alcohol from you. They have every right to cut you off mid drink. They can be held liable if you drink and drive. As long as you get a refund they can absolutely take back your beverage, opened or not.", "They can't take a can that you cracked yourself after the purchase has been made, you cannot force a return of a product either, whoever told you this is a clown because it's literally not the law.\n\nAnd you can't cut someone off from their own property you just want to power trip on people who are equally as misinformed as you are because you work a shitty bartender job.\n\nOnce the purchase is complete it becomes their legal property especially as it was prepackaged alcohol.", "You are still ON PREMISE. You are subject to the laws of that establishment. You are still within the bounds of a TTB liquor license. These are literal boundaries. Just like you can't walk off with a glass of beer. \n\nIf you brought in a beer you bought at a grocery store and cracked it open in a bar, you don't think the bartender would take that away from you? They could be kind and ask you to leave, but they would probably just take your beer the moment you copped an attitude about your property. You're breaking the law and they're the ones who can get in trouble. \n\nOff premise liquor sales are treated exactly the same way, even if you buy it at a brewery you can also buy a pint at. These are treated completely independently by the TTB and are classified differently.", "Lmao the only reason they are able to take beers isn't the law it's because security will just force you out, also if someone is kicking up a stink about their property and you go and take that property they will cave you head in for being a thief.\n\nLike I said, some spindly little bartender thinking he's powerful tries to take my property I'll be causing them personal harm", "Okay it's clear you don't know how the ttb or liquor laws work, and for whatever really want to fight someone. You do you man. \n\nAnd for the record, I'm not a bartender. I was the engineer. It was my job to deal with license boundaries because anytime we added a new facility we had to license it properly. You think you're mad about a bartender taking your beer? The TTB will pour entire pallets down the drain if your ABV or fill volume doesn't match what the label says."]}
