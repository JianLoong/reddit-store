{"id": 6475, "submission_id": "1037lr8", "title": "AITA for cutting my mom's allowance to pay for daycare when she couldn't babysit for me?", "selftext": "Throwaway for anonymity.\n\nLast year my husband (35M) and I (34F) had our first (and last) child. We were fortunate enough to be able to stay at home with him for almost a year by staggering our parental leave and vacations, but now that time has run out and we must return to work. I asked my mother (56F) if she would be available to watch him during the week and she said no. Fair enough.  That's her prerogative. My husband and I researched daycares in the areas where we work and settled on one that came highly recommended. It was expensive though and that meant cutting down on expenses - like the monthly allowance that we'd been giving my mother.\n\nA bit of background to this.\n\nMy parents were married for 28 years before my father decided that he wanted someone younger and sexier than my mother. For all of those 28 years my mother had been a SAHM then SAHW. With my father leaving, she was now meant to survive somehow in a world where she had never really worked because when they got married my father didn't want her to and, because she was raised in a traditional, religious family, she did what the head of household wanted. I'm not even going to go into that man's hypocrisy. Either way, he's gone and even though she got some alimony, she didn't press for as much as she should have (again that religious conditioning) and she's struggling. My husband and I have been supplementing my mother's income to a hefty amount every month which was not an issue until we had to put baby into daycare and found out just how expensive that was in a VHCOL area.\n\nIn light of that, we told her that we would need to cut her allowance in half. We were not planning to start immediately but would take the financial hit for three months to give her to time to adjust and move things around. She got upset and told us that we were punishing her for saying no. I told her that was not the case but it is hard to maintain two households virtually by ourselves if we had to pay an exorbitant amount of our salaries to daycare every month for the foreseeable future. She was still angry and asked us to leave.\n\nLater my sister called us upset that we were \"abandoning mom\" and \"making her struggle\" just because she wouldn't do our bidding. So I suggested to her that she increase how much she was helping considering *she still lives at home*. She called me a fucking bitch and hung up on me.\n\nSo Reddit hive mind, am I really TA here?\n\nETA: I wanted to answer some recurring questions here. My sister's ability to help is limited and sporadic because she struggles with mental illness. It got much worse in recent years and we're working to get her on disability but that is a process. I guess that's why I feel bad about the comment I made to my sister because it was a moment of lashing out when I know that she's in a tough spot through no fault of her own.\n\nAs for my mom, I will work with her to make sure that she can go back to work - especially given my sister's challenges. My mother is neither lazy nor a leech. Unfortunately she's been beaten down by being raised in a traditional culture and having it drilled into her what the duty of a wife is. She was then betrayed by everyone when her husband left.", "created_utc": 1672849174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1037lr8/aita_for_cutting_my_moms_allowance_to_pay_for/", "score": 1179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you're *still* being exceedingly generous to give her half. \n\nAnd if your sister isn't paying at least half of your mom's household expenses (mortgage, food, utilities, etc.) then she's got nothing to say in the matter.", "NTA. After the divorce, your mother needed to start supporting herself financially (info: you mean by still living at home, she still doesn't even have a job?). Yes, a monthly allowance for a few months until she got back on her feet would've been fine, but not a permanent solution to HER financial issues. Now that you have your own family to care for, your child is the priority, not her. She's parentifying you and acting like a child when you have an obligation to get daycare for your child, which she flat out refused to assist you with, despite you assisting her for however long financially. She's a major AH, especially if she's sitting at home not doing anything to help herself, and personally, I'd cut her off completely so she gets a nice, big reality check.", "NTA   You have a small family to take care of.   Your mom, at 56, still has plenty of time in which to work. While she might not get a high paying job, she could still get something unskilled, if she chose.

I commend you for helping your mom as much as you have. But you have to do what you have to do for your child. Unfortunately this is a hard situation and your mom will just have to understand it.", "NTA.  You need to rebudget your lives to pay for child care. You're under no obligation to subsidize your mother's life.\n\nIf someone in your family thinks that what you'll provide is inadequate, suggest that they make up the difference.", "Not at all NTA, in fact more than reasonable. The entitlement of some people leaves me speechless. Your sister should have contributed a long time ago already, and they should both be grateful for the help you are already giving them. Just unbelievable.", "Wow, NTA, most people would just help mom get a job at the grocery store", "NTA. \n\nI completely see where your mom is coming from in this case where she said no and as a result its impacted what you're able to provide for her. She's looking at a very direct point A to point B, action and consequence. \n\nWhereas, the situation is more nuanced than that. If your mom is unable or unwanting to assist with childcare, that means you need to put the child in daycare, that has a cost, that means you need to rework your budget and that impacts what you can afford to give your mom. \n\nThis wasn't a decision made out of spite (I assume), therefore you aren't the AH. \n\nI think even if your mom backtracks on being daycare, you should stick to it.", "NTA. Your mom can go get a job somewhere that requires little to no experience. Even just a part time time would help.

Your mom has a right to say no to babysitting. You have a right to decide how much you are generously giving her every month. Your mom could always get a part time job to help supplement her income. Does your sister work or is she benefiting from your generosity as well? Might be time to have a harsh reality conversation with mom and sister.", "NTA. You are not obligated to support your mother. You are, however, obligated to see to it that your child has everything he needs, including good daycare.", "NTA. Your mom's situation sucks, but it's not your responsibility.", "NTA\n\nThis wasn't a personal decision, but a financial one. You two can't afford both daycare and to give your mother money, period. \n\nYour sister is so entitled, same as your mom for being okay just receiving money from you guys like that.", "NTA. I think you've been extremely generous to subsidize your mom's living costs, but you will increasingly need to focus on raising your own children (daycare, saving for college) etc. It sounds like your mom doesn't have much financial sense, but you need to make sure your own financial house is in order and that you are being responsible for the future so that the cycle of kids supporting parents doesn't happen again!", "NTA you\u2019re making people uncomfortable but that is purely based on their own choices. \n\nYou haven\u2019t given your sisters age but I assume she\u2019s of working age so yes, she can now step up. \n\nYour mum has a choice here too- look after your child AND get paid for it, or don\u2019t and you pay someone else.", "NTA. Adults are not obligated to provide for other adults. Your spending should be on your family first. Mom is an adult. She should support herself.", "NTA-the allowance to her I would consider \u201cemergency assistance\u201d. Life happens and we all need help from time to time, but there comes a point where she needs to get out and on her own. It was awesome of you to help her out, but you are no longer able to. That\u2019s fair. Don\u2019t beat yourself up about it.", "NTA.  It was generous for you to help out, but circumstances have changed.

Realize that just because mom hasnt worked outside the home doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t.  You might want to have a sit-down with mom to explain that while you\u2019ve been happy to help her out, you don\u2019t know what the future holds nor what your nuclear family\u2019s needs will be, so you can\u2019t honestly guarantee what you will be able to provide in the future.  While it\u2019s up to her, she might want to consider either seeking work or starting with an evaluation of skills and training/work options.  She\u2019s got 10-11 years until full retirement age and plenty of time for a mini-career.", "NTA. your child comes before your mother. \n\nShe should be grateful that you have been helping her but should not be taking it for granted. She needs to learn to live within her means. \n\nAnd your sister needs to step up.", "NTA. She's 56 not 96. If she wants the same amount of money, she can get a job. Granted her options are a lot more limited at her age, but she only needs to earn enough to cover half of what she's been getting. Or, as you said, your sister can pitch in.", "NTA. Your mother is no longer fresh out of this divorce, she has had plenty of time to learn how to get a job and you're giving her 3 months to learn to re-budget her finances. Your child needs your financial support more than she does.", "Nta,\nIt was great you have been able to help her out but she is still an adult and had another adult living at home.  They are not your primary responsibility.", "So... pull out all of the family and sentimental baggage from the situation and look at it openly. Your mother's circumstances changed. As a result of that change, you adjusted to help her. Now your circumstances changed, so you needed to adjust. She has benefited for quite some time, but things change. From the start, she should have been taking actions to limit her reliability on your family.\n\nAdditionally, she chose to not watch your child. Completely makes sense and is fair. All one can do is ask. You aren't putting your child in daycare to punish her. Its because you need a safe place for your child while you work. The alternative is that one of you quits your job to stay home with your child and the result is even less money for mom.\n\nDo not set yourself on fire to save someone else. Do what is best for your family and be firm with your mother. Don't allow her guilt trip to force you to make a decision that negatively impacts your family.", "INFO  - why is your mother unwilling to watch the baby? And would it be possible for her to watch him for a couple days a week? Does your sister contribute anything?", "NTA. Not even a little bit. I'd stop giving money entirely.", "NTA. A grown woman can and should take care of herself. I can\u2019t believe she gets an \u201callowance\u201d. Wow. Focus that money on your nuclear family and a college fund for your kiddo.

Your responsibility is to your child first, mom second. It sucks how her life played out, but that doesn't mean you go broke for her. Someone has to watch the kid. Your and her incomes were going to take a hit even if you or husband became a SAHP.\n\nMaybe you guys could have discussed this before the baby was born so that your mom would have more time to get herself in a more financially independent place.

She made her choices, and I concede that she didn\u2019t choose to be single at this stage of her life, but she certainly chose not to face the music and make sure her ex didn\u2019t leave her in a complete lurch. That said, everyone walks into their first job without any previous experience and plenty of those first-timers are older folks. At this point, being fully supported without doing any work is not an option for your mother. Either she watches your son so that you can pay her rather than a daycare or she gets a job.

Is it her plan to have you and your husband support her (albeit supplementally) for the rest of her life? Is the alimony your AH father paying her an indefinite arrangement? Since your sister also lives with your mom, is it also understood that as you\u2019re supplementally supporting your mom, you\u2019re also supporting her?\n\nDo Mom and Sister understand that you are going back to work in order to support your family?
