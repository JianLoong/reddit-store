Because for all that you now know, there is so much more I'm sure that's been said and you don't know. \n\n  You definitely need to speak up, and stand up for yourself. Place either boundaries or cut them off completely. This should start with your husband. \n\n  People that talk like this behind their friends back, imo are not a true friend. Personally, I would never be able to move past what I heard.  If I can't trust you, I have no room in my head, heart or life for you. \n\n  Mr. Husband would be the soulcrusher. So not only has he betrayed you by partaking in this conversation bashing you. In all honestly, he is probably the ringer and instigator. He didn't stand up for you, he didn't have your back. He had at no issues betraying you and laughing about you behind your back. \n\n  \"You might not always remember what was said, but you'll always remember the way it made you feel. \"\n\n  That feeling you will soon realize, isn't one that you will ever be able to get past. So now the question is,  how much do you value your health, well being, mental health and sanity? Because after hearing what you heard, anytime hubby or friends, you're all together, that is what will be running through your mind. Am I the butt of jokes again? Is he really doing what he said?

Who recorded it and what were their intentions?\n\nWhen you feel you're in a place where you can address this with your husband without getting stressed to the point of throwing up, talk to him first and explain you feel hurt by the things that were said about you, and that you expected friends to talk directly to you.\n\nThen, after talking to your husband, maybe you should think about the information you were given and consider if having those friends in your life is in your best interest or not.\n\nDon't worry too much about the \"psychologically damaging\" comment. It is clear that, at the time they had that conversation, they were not too worried about any psychological damage they could be doing to you.", "NTA. Tell EVERYONE the truth. Don't be a fake coward like them. They smile in your face and say something else behind your back. Calm down. Breathe. Then let them know what the deal is. Start with your husband.

I'm trying to work through it but I don't know what to say to any of you and I don't know how to trust you to tell me the truth when you've been saying and doing things behind my back.\" And then get into see a therapist who can help you navigate this.

So you know this could be the reason for what they are saying.\n\nBut they can feel that way AND still love you. By all means confront them and tell them how their words hurt you.

This is all of what, one night?! \n\nNo.\n\nI will say tho, and I think you understand, blocking people will not help you. There is a conversation you inevitably will have to have as you\u2019re actually married to one of these fools. So in your own time, face that reality.\n\nETA: I 100% believe your love for your husband. And as a fellow neurodivergent with adhd and on the spectrum \ud83d\udc4b all I can actually say is your husband should be your god damn cheerleader and enjoy you. My oddities make me a delight to my husband and he innately understands things about me that maybe other people *see* as annoying but he gets me. In his eyes, im cool as hell.\n\nTHAT, that\u2019s what you deserve.", "It looks like you have Internet strangers here who also care.", "They likely do. I wonder if they have a ND that causes increased justice sensitivity.\n\nThey did the right thing. They saw people being shitty to someone who didn't deserve it and decided to act. \n\nNow you need to act. Don't let this stranger be more protective over you than you are of yourself. \n\nThat acquaintance thought you deserved to know so they made sure you did. They thought you deserved a chance so they stuck their neck out.\n\nHow you move forward will depend on what YOU think you deserve. \n\nI don't think you deserve this. The person who sent the recording didn't think you deserve this. Do you?", "Absolutely not, OP. Look at it this way: you potentially made some social blunders, but you were **not** the one manipulating and mocking a so-called loved one behind their back. Why should you be harder on yourself than on the people who were being knowingly, deliberately cruel?\n\nMistakes are just that: mistakes. I\u2019d much rather be friends with someone who makes mistakes than someone who chooses to be cruel.", "Don\u2019t let anyone else decide your worth. You are as good and worthy as anyone else on the planet. And I bet you\u2019re doing much better than you think. \n\nThose unkind fake friends are the ones who should be feeling so bad about what they said that they want to crawl into a hole.", "There\u2019s your real friend.", "Thank you for replying. I was hoping this had happened some time ago, that it was some evening where they were talking BS about other people, and eventually had grown out of that mindset. I was wrong.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that might be enough to burn some bridges.\n\nI would talk to your husband first, when you're sure you can do it without getting over stressed. Play the recording for him and ask him how and why. As your husband, I think he deserves this small bit of preferential treatment, to have the issue addressed face to face. But only you can decide the outcome.\n\nAs for your friends, another redditor posted a comment I agree with: forward the recording to the group, add a message saying there is no coming back from the hurt they caused with this, and then block them - at least for the time being. You don't need to be bombarded with fauxpologies and crocodile tears.\n\nAnnoying or not, real friends would have tried to communicate to you about any discomfort they might feel. Instead, they preferred... this.\n\nI offer you my sympathy. Please accept a hug from this internet stranger. { }\n\nEdit: wording", "i dont think there is any going back after hearing that. your husband, SMH, needs to be punched in the nose a few times. id tell them eventually but dont out the friend that gave it to you. just tell them u know bout how they both tried foisting u off on eachother as a punishment and u dont want to punish any of them ever again. im sorry this is BS", "Then I would send a text and say due to recent discoveries, you realize how they really see you so you are removing yourself from the group and have no interest in a relationship with them. \n\nAs for my husband, if they are his friends and he continues to want to hang out with them, I wouldn\u2019t stop him but it will be awkward AF IMO. Like he\u2019s ok with them treating you that way? Hopefully you all can find others you both enjoy hanging out with and they fade away.", "Don\u2019t send them anything. Protect the person who sent it to you. Never do anything that would disclose who it was.", "I totally get it. I'm sorry.", "I don\u2019t think he loves me.  I don\u2019t think he ever did. \n\nI can\u2019t trust any of them.", "This is incredibly juvenile response. If the OP just disappears, she will appear unhinged, which won't look good for her in a potential divorce. And while she can do what she likes with her friendships, they aren't the real problem. Friends do occasionally find other friends annoying, and Jen apparently didn't choose OP as a friend, they seem to be forced together because their partners are bets friends.", "I don\u2019t think I can trust any of them, especially my husband, again.", "I just found out that not only does my husband not have my back, I\u2019m a performing clown in the circus who\u2019s laughed at by him and our friends", "The husband doesn't need to know anything. She can leave and serve him with divorce papers. None of these abusive liars need or are entitled to anything. She can do whatever she wants to do. They know they talk shit about her and plan elaborate schemes to shit on her and mock her. They already know. She doesn't have to enlighten them that they are garbage", "Thank you. It\u2019s hard for me to accept anything as my life is literally the worst nightmare I\u2019ve feared.", "4 years.", "Because she isolated herself in the homeoffcie saying she probably got the flu.", "Because she said she was sick", "\ud83d\udc4b I care about OP!", "This is literally my worst nightmare: that everyone secretly hated me and found me irritating. It\u2019s true. \n\nAt work, I always felt awful for the wives of some of my coworkers. They hated their wives.\n\nI\u2019m not numb. I feel horrible. I feel like a punishment.", "I don\u2019t think any of these friendships will survive. I doubt my marriage will.", "her husband was the main offender. what he said and did is far worst than the friend", "Listen to me. I'm a divorce attorney. Get your most important items and leave to your mom. Get paperwork get clothes for a week take your passport your tech photos pet's whatever. Then start interviewing divorce lawyers. Get a protective order and consider filling for a nullification. This man defrauded you. You owe nothing to him or this \"friend\" group. Dm me if I can help you", "Shut up", "What the fuck. You can take as much time as you need to before talking to him about this. Your friend is wrong. You're licking your goddamn wounds, not maliciously giving them the silent treatment.\n\nYou're the victim here. YOU are the wronged party. You are entitled to some time to absorb the hit and process the betrayal.\n\nYour husband and friends suck. I have ADHD and I'd probably think they're boring and you're fun. \n\nShit, they're adults and they're acting like middle school bullies. They're fucking losers.\n\nI'm sure your rejection sensitivity dysphoria is out of control right now but I want you to really think about what I'm saying. \n\nThese people are having fun being cruel. They're talking shit about someone they're supposed to care for and laughing about it.\n\nNice people don't do that. Good friends don't do that. Good partners don't do that.\n\nThese are not your people and honestly? That might be for the best since they fucking suck.", "You didn't perform. They suck. You get yourself and whatever is most valuable (your paperwork jewelery money whatever you need to move to your moms ) and by Friday start talking to divorce lawyers. You could make a cause for fraudulent inducement to marriage. If you have a good enough lawyer and you live in a state with applicable statutes, you might be able to get it annulled, no divorce necessary.", "So you have further evidence?", "This is just awful. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve been treated this way. I don\u2019t even know what to say. What a bunch of assholes.", "I\u2019m so sorry OP. Your pain is evident and I wish, unlike those others, that I could be in the same room as you and give you a shoulder to cry on. \n\nFWIW, I\u2019d rather hang out with you than them any day. \n\nMaybe your husband, but otherwise I don\u2019t think you owe them an explanation. They know what they did. All you need to do is keep your chin up so you can look down on them.", "Me too. My heart is hurting for OP.", "\"I feel like a punishment.\" \n\nAs someone who has replayed this exact broken record over and over again in my own head, that is the opposite of the truth. The truth is, your \"friends\" and husband are a blight on the lives of everyone they meet. They are the punishment, but worse. They punish the innocent. I agree with your mom. Get all important documents and valuables, don't say a word, and get back as fast as you can to your mom's place. Then, and ONLY, then should you make the decision to bring this up with them. And definitely don't out your source.", "You\u2019re not a punishment! They are just crappy people! \n\nHave you read the story of the Ugly Duckling? UD got made fun of and treated badly too. The ducks told her she was ugly. Then one day the UD grew up and lo and behold\u2014she wasn\u2019t a duck at all! She was a beautiful swan! So she left the mean ducks and found the other swans, where she fit right in and was welcomed. \n\nMy wish for you is that one day you find the other beautiful swans, just like you.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you! I\u2019ve been ostracized before with people talking about me behind my back when I was a young teen, and it scarred me, which my ex knew. Then I found out my former in laws and ex were talking crap about me too because they were rich snooty jerks who looked down on me for being middle class, and it\u2019s the absolute worst. I didn\u2019t get past it and got a divorce. \n\nThe betrayal is earth shattering, but please know it\u2019s not you that is the unworthy one - they are utterly unworthy of you. They are the AH. Please take care of yourself and go to your mom. You deserve to be with the people who love you."]}
