We had to move because in 2021 my dad sold our house to move in to help his father leaving my mom and I nowhere to go. My parents had been divorced since 2009 but they lived together to raise my brother and I. My mom and her boyfriend had been seeing each other for about 7 months prior to the move. \n\nI have a cat named Link. I adopted him for my 16th birthday and I love him so much. Timmy hates animals. Link is a very lovable cat and always has been. He never bites, scratches, or hisses unless he\u2019s being playful. Once he realizes he hurt someone he\u2019ll lick them as a way of saying sorry. Needless to say, Link has done nothing to Timmy. \n\nA few months after we had moved in, I noticed that he was kicking Link to move him out of the way. He would be standing somewhere and Link would walk up to him and he would \u201cmove him with his foot\u201d. My brother had come over and saw him kick Link as well. It had already been brought to my moms attention and she\u2019s talked to him but he keeps doing it. \n\nThat\u2019s my main issue but there have been several instances that have made me mad or uncomfortable around him, ie. badmouthing me because I was having an anxiety attack, yelling at me for an OCD habit I do, telling me that the noises he heard outside made him think I was having sex (he\u2019s in his 60s and I was freshly 18, it made me very uncomfortable to be around him after that). I\u2019ve confronted him about all of it several times.\n\nHe\u2019s not nice to my mother either. We both hate our living situation but haven\u2019t been able to get the funds to move out. He doesn\u2019t talk to me now because he knows I\u2019ll defend who/what I love and what I\u2019m passionate about. I have no issues calling him out but my mom tells me not to because he gripes about me whenever I\u2019m not around to her. I feel like I\u2019m the asshole because he\u2019s allowing my mom and I to live in his house and pays all the bills. I don\u2019t like him because of all the shit he has done/said.

Maybe dad would be an option. Another family member. Maybe you can afford to rent something with roommates. But realistically, \"stepdad\" isn't going to change and Mom can't afford to live someplace else- so this is your reality unless you can afford to move out.\n\nBut if you aren't working, that is going to have to be step one. Even if you are in school, a part-time job may be hard but if your goal is not to live with your mom's BF, it's a necessity.

I am NOT going to leave my mother in the same house as him without me here. As her daughter, I feel the need to protect her as much as she has protected me.

I\u2019m not allowed to have any pets down there so that\u2019s out of the question. \n\nI don\u2019t have a job due to mental health struggles which is the same reason I don\u2019t go to school.

You can't go forever without any income relying on your mom and others.  Maybe not now, but work on a plan.  \n\nBut if your cat is being abused and you can't leave the current situation, the best think for it is to rehome it, perhaps seeing if someone would be willing to foster it until you can find a better living situation.\n\nOften in life we need to make tough situations in order to move forward again and for what is best for all involved.

If not, quit expecting everyone but yourself to do the hard work of taking care of you. I have a feeling I know why Timmy doesn\u2019t like you. You contribute nothing, argue with him constantly in his own home and expect everyone else to change to take care of you and your cat? Sound about right?
