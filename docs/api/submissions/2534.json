We have a 16 yo son together \"Mason\". I got remarried to my husband (M.) Nathan.\n\n\nMy ex husband and I used to argue on who should get Mason for the holidays back when he was little. As he got older we started letting him decide. Last year he spend Christmas with me, Nathan and my inlaws and he complained that the experience was \"terrible\" because he said Nathan and his family had little to no accomodation for his food choices (I'm not defending them but my inlaws are quite traditional when it comes to food and a bit ignorant to what types of foods Mason eats). He also said he didn't feel as welcom as the other kids in the family and that Nathan forced him to share his personal stuff like his phone so that his stepnephews could watch christmas movies.\n\n\nYesterday, during breakfast we were talking about christmas and what we were planning this year but hem out of nowhere announced that he'll be spending this Christmas with his dad at a rental christmas cottage in his favorite town. I was stunned, so was Nathan. I asked Mason when and how he agreed to this arrangement but he pointed back to what happened last christmas and said he didn't want to basically \"have another shitty holiday and be miserable\" I told him that his dad should've come to me first but he argued that he's already okayed it and so he saw no need for my opinion. We started arguing and he started complaining about me trying to ruin the experience but in response I told him that he has already ruined christmas for me and his stepdad the minhte he agreed to this arrangement. He got up and walked away after saying that I was being \"overdramatic\". Nathan just sat there and looked down.\n\n\nI had a huge argument on the phone with Mason's dad and he kept giving me an attitude and laughjng and saying that I sounded pathetic. When I told him I'd have my lawyer call him, he bbackpaddeled and said he woukdn't have done this if Mason didn't like it. He urged me to drop it and let Mason have this experience or he'll resent me for missing it. Now Mason isn't speaking to me. Nathan is trying to convince him to stay with us because without him, our christmas is ruined but he won't budge from the looks of it.\n\n\nAITA for not dropping it as well? What I meant by \"why didn't his dad come to me first\" is that he planned to take Mason out of town which is a big deal to me. There's going to be traveling.", "created_utc": 1668686497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxogxf/aita_for_telling_my_son_that_he_ruined_christmas/", "score": 8746, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get over yourself. Start thinking of your son.\n\nYou did nothing to make his holiday a good one last year. You let him be miserable and just defended your in-laws. Instead of supporting your son's choice, you throw a tantrum and threaten your ex. Some parent you're being. You're acting more like a kid than your own kid.", "Yeah, in my opinion, YTA. \n\nHe spent last Christmas with you guys, I think it's only fair for him to want to spend this Christmas with his dad. \n\nTotally unfair for you to say that he ruined Christmas, he's a kid still. \n\nDid you think he'd spend every holiday with you guys when he also has a dad he'd like to spend the holidays with?", "YTA\n\nMaybe if Mason had enjoyed his Christmas, and was treated fairly, he\u2019d want to be around you for Christmas?\n\nHe also chose to spend it with you last year, why can\u2019t he switch off this year if you \u201clet him choose\u201d?\n\nI get the impression that the only reason you give him an option is so that you get to lord it over your ex when you get picked, but now that it\u2019s gone the other way you\u2019re throwing a tantrum. And you\u2019re going to ruin your kid\u2019s holiday (and your relationship with him) if you keep pushing this.", "YTA. It sounds like you and your ex established that your son gets to decide - so when he decides he doesn't want to spend Christmas with you, you pull out an emotional manipulation tactic? I think it would be fair for your son to spend Christmas with his dad just based on the fact alone that he spent it with you last year. But all of that aside, it's a really unfair expectation to put on a child that if they don't do what you want your holiday is ruined. That is not a healthy emotional boundary and will foster resentment.", "You are so obviously the AH that I have a hard time believing this is real, but I'll answer you anyway.\n\n>Nathan and his family had little to no accomodation for his food choices (I'm not defending them but my inlaws are quite traditional when it comes to food and a bit ignorant to what types of foods Mason eats).

Instead of lashing out at everyone else, why don't you take a good hard look at yourself and understand what YOU did to drive him away.\n\nDo better. YTA.", "YTA\n\n>As he got older we started letting him decide.\n\nEnd of story, he decided.

What odd logic is this?", "YTA wtf your kid didn't like Christmas last year, because he was FORCED TO SHARE HIS STUFF, what's the problem??? Don't you have any empathy for him?\n\nThat being said, he is 16. 16! He can decide where he wants to spend Christmas AS PER YOU AND YOUR EXES AGREEMENT. He did that. And you shame him for it, as well as threaten your ex with a lawyer??? I have no words.", "YTA. You let Mason decide, Mason decided.

YTA because you're just salty he chose his father over his crappy stepdad", "So you can only have a good Christmas if your son is miserable? \n\nYTA.", "YTA. He chose you last year and was miserable (and from what you describe, I understand why). Now he's choosing his father. He's 16 and old enough to make this decision. Where you really shine as an ahole is in blaming your child for 'ruining Christmas' when that's on you. Go spend it with your inlaws and let Mason enjoy his holiday.", "YTA 100% he is 16 he should be able to decide which parent he wants to spend the holiday with and you sound more concerned with your feelings than your child\u2019s feelings. He didn\u2019t have a good time last year and you even admit that they weren\u2019t accommodating.", "You say in the 2nd paragraph that you let Mason choose where he spends Christmas, but once he's made that choice you try guilt trip and manipulate him into doing what you want. Imagine telling your kid that they've ruined Christmas. YTA", "YTA. Why does your happy Christmas matter more than Mason's and his dad's?", "YTA you said that that your son gets to decide which parent he spends Christmas with, and he has done that. Are you backing out on that? He spent last Christmas with you anyway, so this year should be his dads turn regardless. You\u2019re the one ruining Christmas for everyone.", "YTA most definitely. You said the kid gets to pick who he spends Christmas with, and he spent it with you last year and wants to spend it with his dad this year, because he didn't enjoy his time with you. Out of curiosity what are his food issues?", "You gave him a choice.  If you respect your son, then you need to respect his choice.  It sounds like you don\u2019t care about his personal frustrations and reasoning at all.  YTA.", "YTA\n\nFrom the info you've given, you said Mason has every right to choose where he wants to go for Christmas.  And he chose.  Did you just assume he would always choose you?  Why would you assume that?  He has valid reasons from what you described.  He's not some stuffed toy you get to keep by your bed.  Your Christmas isn't ruined unless you had already made plans that centered on him, in which case, you should have discussed this with him.\n\nIf there's other things to make it more nuanced, you'd better add it because at the moment this just screams entitlement from you and your husband.", "No lawyer or court will do jack all to force a 16 year old into a house they don\u2019t want to be in. At this point in custody cases they make the decisions. YTA because your son is getting forced to share his personal stuff with people who don\u2019t care about him enough to have food he likes.  I get that it\u2019s holidays but usually theirs a dish everyone likes.", "YTA, you got Christmas last year and...well you fubar'ed it. Have you ever been a family get-together where you feel less than or unwanted? it sucks...it taints the experience and having to do it over and over taints the holiday.\nYour anger should be with his dad, who should have spoken to you first. Your son didn't ruin your Xmas, you did when you failed and ruined his Christmas...why is your holiday experience more important than his?", "YTA - it was your turn last year, so what's wrong with it being dad's turn this year? Also, getting lawyer involved for a 16 year old? Really? I mean surely he can decide what he wants to do and no judge with an ounce of common sense will make him do it otherwise.", "YTA\n\nDidn't you agree in letting your son decide where to spend holidays?", "YTA. What happened to Mason getting to decide who he spends Xmas with? I\u2019d be very surprised if any judge wouldn\u2019t take into account the decision of a 16 year old if it even got that far. You clearly don\u2019t care about your son and his feelings. Don\u2019t be surprised if he goes NC with you once he\u2019s old enough to leave home due to your complete lack of respect for him and his things.", "YATA. The boy hated it last year, and doesn't want to go through it again. Leave him be.", "YTA, and I think if you read what you wrote you\u2019d see that yourself if you weren\u2019t so blinded by your own selfishness.", "Yeah absolutely YTA. That exact sort of thing is why he doesn't want to be around you", "YTA.\n\nYou gave him a choice and he made one. Seeing that it isn\u2019t that one you wanted him to make, you\u2019re taking it out on him.", "YTA. He's d enough to choose for himself, you had hum for Christmas last year and it sounds like he didn't enjoy it, so he's spending it with his Dad this year. Which sounds fair, surely it's his Dad's turn anyway?\nGuilt tripping him into spending it with you (or trying to) is just going to push him further away.\nSupport his decision, have a Christmas with him either before or after the actual day, and take on board what he said about last Christmas.\nPretty soon he'll be able to decide for himself whete he wants to live. \nDon't push him away.", "What an AHole. You\u2019ve told Mason he can choose and then drop a nuclear guilt bomb on the poor kid! Seriously, you and Nathan ought to be ashamed of yourselves for acting this way. And threatening to get lawyers involved?! My gawd YTA so hard.", "YTA. \n\nFirst, basics/applies even generically:   He\u2019s old enough to choose where to go, and you said you\u2019ve allowed that for some time now. He was with you last year, seems normal he\u2019d be with dad this year.  Plus, dad arranged a special trip to a favorite place.\n\nSecond, major asshole, because you\u2019re guilting him by saying he\u2019s ruining your Christmas.   Shitty thing to emotionally blackmail your kids.  Also the bit about no food for him because in-laws family are \u2018ignorant when it comes to the types of food Mason eats \u2019.  Sounds like YOU haven\u2019t bothered to educate them ie advocate for your kid, and Mason knows that.", "YTA. Let me make sure I get this correct, Mason had a terrible experience with your husband\u2019s side of the family, where he felt unwelcomed and was required to share his personal stuff and you were actually shocked to know that he doesn\u2019t want to spend this coming Christmas with you? Either you and your husband are both that dense or both of you think that you\u2019re the main characters and the whole world revolves around you and that everyone else are just side characters that should do as you please? And even without all of that, Mason spent Christmas last year with you, it\u2019s only fair he spends it with his dad this year.", "YTA \n\nYou had Christmas with him last year and you let his step family ruin it. \n\nYou very clearly do not give 2 shots about your son and only care about making yourself look good if your this bent out of shape  on him spending a holiday with his actual father and then having the audacity to get the courts involved. \n\nNews flash sweetheart, your son is now old enough to decide where he wants to live permanently (and the courts will listen to him) and it most likely won\u2019t be with you. \n\nGet your head out of your ass and let your son spends Christmas how HE wants- at a place here he actually feels welcome\n\nEDIT: Just to add, my family did the same thing  to me that your sons step family did to him the last time I went to a holiday. Since then I haven\u2019t celebrated ANY holidays with them in 5 years. Keep it up and this is most likely be what\u2019s waiting for you", "YTA for so many reasons! \n1 - you said it was his choice but now you\u2019re trying to guilt him into doing what you want.\n2- he spent last year with you so isn\u2019t it fair that he gets to spend time with his dad this year?!\n3- who tells a child their actions are ruining Christmas?! \n4- you threatened your ex with lawyers when he did nothing wrong\n\nYou sound butt hurt that you assumed your son would pick you always. Honestly disgusting behaviour.", "\"We started letting him decide\"\n\nMason : decides\n\nMother : shocked Pikachu face\n\nYTA", "Yta. You had him last Christmas, and it wasn't enjoyable for him. Your making his decisions about you rather than trying to make it a nice Christmas for him. \nHe's old enough to make his own decisions and given the circumstances he was in last year, you can't blame him.

U both agreed it was Mason's choice, but u don't like it bc he choose his dad instead if u.", "YTA\n\nSo you want your kid to be miserable just to humor you?

You agreed Mason gets to pick and now you're trying to guilt him for his choice? YTA YTA YTA. He had a miserable time last year and you didn't defend nor help him. It doesn't even seem like you care about your son, you just want to control him. And switching off Christmas every year I'd perfectly reasonable. If you keep pushing down this path, you're going to not have a relationship with Mason soon.", "You say you are letting him choose, but throw a fit when he chooses his dad. \n\nHe didn\u2019t have a good experience last year, and you are mentioning no solutions which would make him want to do it again.\n\nAnd even forgetting all that wouldn\u2019t it be fair that after spending last year with you this year is his dads turn?

As he got older we let him decide.\n\nThen what\u2019s the problem? He decided. Oh I see, it\u2019s because he didn\u2019t pick you so you think he chose wrong.\n\nWell, tough.\n\nHe\u2019s not ruining your Christmas, the guilt trip and dramatics from you were totally unnecessary.\n\nThreatening his dad with a lawyer because you didn\u2019t get your way\u2026 Here, have some extra AH points for that \ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47", "So basically you said it can be his decision where he spends holidays but when he doesn\u2019t choose to spend it with you, you threaten to call your lawyer.

He shouldn't have had to share his phone or personal space and belongings, especially with people he may not view as family. \n\n- You dismissed his feeling when he brought them up, and they sound perfectly valid. He was forced to spend Christmas with family who don't view him as family by the sound of things. \n\n- You had him last year, but apparently him spending Christmas with his dad isn't important. Why? Why should he always spend Christmas with you? His dad is still one of his parents and you shouldn't be trying to replace him or that side of his family. \n\n- You guilted him. On purpose. Trying to emotionally manipulate him. Not ok. If you want to teachhim how to respect people's boundaries, and be respected in return, lead by example\n\nIt's ok to feel hurt, it's not ok to act like this. You want to make amends, validate his feelings, let him know he'll be more of a priority to you next Christmas and you hope he'll forgive you and spend time with you then.

Because that is going to happen if you keep this up.", "So I'm come from a Divorced household and holidays where a nightmare for when I had to choose between who to spend it with. \n\nWhen I became an adult I actually stopped celebrating most of them.

Because that's how it sounds. \n\nIf we add in the fact that his last Xmas was an awful experience for him, can you really blame Mason? Him saying you ruined the experience is true, since you're making him feel that wanting to be with his dad is wrong.

He clearly seems like he will enjoy it more and he has different needs and priorities as a 16 yo than to babysit the younger kids in the family and provide entertainment for them..", "YTA! \"We decided to let him choose who he wanted to spend holiday with, but i never imagined he woudnt choose little old me pitiful me!! Guess ill guilt trip him. After all hes just a child and my happiness is the priority\"", "YTA Your christmas is ruined, what about your son's? I thought you had agreed that he could choose where he spend the holidays? I guess as long as he choses you that is.", "YTA because you\u2019re only thinking of yourself and not Mason. It\u2019s his holiday too, he spent it with you last year and you didn\u2019t do anything to make it a good holiday for him. He\u2019s allowed to spend it elsewhere. Also he\u2019s 16 not 6 so his dad probably doesn\u2019t need your permission to take him away for a holiday. (Unless there\u2019s some court order here we don\u2019t know about) .\n\n\nYou\u2019re really only concerned with yourself \u201cour Christmas is ruined\u201d. It\u2019s gross.", "YTA. You took him some place he felt unwelcome, made him share his personal items with a bunch of kids to keep them quiet, didn\u2019t make any plan at all to feed him, and you expect him to want to do that again? And drop this crap about letting him choose. You only let him pick if he picks what you want. As soon as he picked something else, you started in with the manipulation tactics. The only sensible thing I saw here was that your husband kept his mouth shut. \n\nGo apologize to your son. Tell him you hope he has a lot of fun on his trip with his dad, and grow up some.", "Clearly YTA.. so you let him decide so long as he chooses you? \n\nYou literally gave him autonomy and now you\u2019re bitching about it because it didn\u2019t go your way. I don\u2019t even need to mention how he was with you last year, or how he had a crappy time - just giving him the choice and backtracking when he exercises it is enough.", "YTA. i hope you do call your lawyer! hopefully they reevaluate this whooole situation by asking MASON how he feels and how MASON likes being with you and your \"family\"", "YTA", "Obviously yta", "YTA.\nIt's Mason's choice, like you stated. Mason didn't have a good time with your family last year (and it doesn't sound like you even attempted to fix that problem), so of course he wants to spend this holiday with his dad.\nIt sounds like the \"it's Mason's choice\" really meant \"Mason can decide to either spend the holidays with us, or he can spend the holidays with us\".\nAlso, if his step dad's family doesn't accommodate him, maybe that's a problem that you should fix instead of just worrying about yourself.", "I honestly can't understand why you don't recognize YTA. Here are some reasons: \n\n1.) You agreed to allow Mason the choice of where to spend Christmas. When he decides he wants to spend this year with his dad, not only to you belittle and berate him for his choice, but you act like a literal 3 year old and tell him he's ruined Christmas for you. You're being emotionally manipulative, deceitful, and uncaring for his wants and emotional needs.\n\n\n2.) Mason has valid reasons for not wanting to spend Christmas with you (although I will point out \"I just don't want to\" is also a valid reason and you should respect that regardless). He said he doesn't feel welcome, his step-father made him share his private/personal property when he didn't want to (why didn't Nathan share his phone so someone could watch Christmas movies?), and no one accommodated his dietary requirements. If you knew your in-laws are rigid in their cooking behavior YOU should have brought food for Mason, or allowed him to cook and bring it. It sounds like you don't care about his experiences at all, and have no desire to rectify anything this year. \n\n\n\n3.) Mason is 16. Irrespective of your lie about letting him choose, he is old enough to have input into where he wants to spend his time, and with whom. He isn't 6. \n\n\n4.) All these things aside, as a parent it is irresponsible to blame your feelings on your child. It is NOT his fault Christmas is ruined. It is your fault. You should have control over your own emotions (and if you don't then I'd suggest going to therapy and learning some coping mechanisms) and should figure out how to make the best of the situation. If you can't do that, then the LEAST you can do as a parent is be happy that your son is having a better Christmas this year, and find solace in the fact that he's happy and safe and able to advocate for himself. \n\n\nGrow up. If you keep this type of attitude up Mason won't want anything to do with you when he's an adult.", "YTA. He already told you his last Christmas sucked and you didn\u2019t care.  Now it\u2019s your turn for Christmas to suck and he shouldn\u2019t care. He\u2019s 16 not 6", "YTA. My parents divorced when I was 15. If my dad (who i lived with) pulled this I\u2019d immediately would\u2019ve moved out. You\u2019re only thinking about yourself and your happy new family, not about the wellbeing of your son.", "YTA.", "You give him a choice, u didn't made anything to make his last Christmas better, made him give his things and got mad when he didn't choose you? Mason is a person not a dog.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Why would you want to make your son endure another crappy holiday when he can have a really exciting time with his father? Stop hating your ex so much that it impacts your child.", "YTA \n\nNice try to manipulate him and making him repo single for your ruined Christmas.", "Jesus Christ you are an AH!!! You \u201callow him to choose.\u201d Horse crap. You allow him the illusion of choosing your plans than being miserable at them, or getting a massive guilt trip when he wants to enjoy his holiday. \n\nYou, Nathan and his family should celebrate by eating a big bag of eggplant, and let the kid enjoy his holiday with his Dad. And prepare for when he hits 18 and decides to go NC with both of you.", "YTA- \u201cwe started letting him choose\u201d\u2026.but is only OK when he chooses to stay with us. What an asshole.", "YTA. You said it\u2019s up to him to decide and then complained when it wasn\u2019t with you. Sounds like he had a crap Christmas last year and would like a better time. You even said there weren\u2019t any accommodations for what he eats and it sounds like you did nothing to make it better for him", "YTA. You said he gets to choose and now you're mad he chose is dad over you. You had him last year so only fair his dad gets him this year anyways. Obviously he had a bad experience last year. I'm willing to bet that there have been other issues throughout the year involving you and your husband. Don't be surprised if he wants to stay with his Dad full time. Clearly he has a better time with him and seems like his Dad loves him more than you do.", "YTA. \nAs the parent and as a divirced parent aswell. Massive a-hole move. Holy shit", "Wtf? Obviously YTA.", "So let me get this straight? Your son only gets to decide if he chooses you, otherwise his dad has to ask your permission first if he chooses him?\n\nI think you know YTA", "\u201cAs he got older we let him decide.\u201d\n\nThe kid is 16 and his priorities are going to be different. I\u2019m not sure why your holiday plans will be ruined without him if you claim to let him decide who he\u2019s spending them with. Guilting him into staying with you when he wasn\u2019t comfortable with Nathan\u2019s family last year then threatening dad with a lawyer is pretty bad. YTA", "What are you gonna do when Mason decides to live with his dad full time after this helicopter parent shit show? YTA", "YES YTA. He can choose which parent to spend time with. This is horrible behavior as a parent. STOP IT and apologize to him. Use better communication like you wish he would spend it with you but you understand that he\u2019d like to spend it with dad.", "Yta. \u201cAs he got older we started letting him decide\u201d \n\nHe decided against you and now you\u2019re mad and guilt tripping him. How is that in any way letting him decide? He told you how and why he made the choice too, good on him.", "YTA because you let your kid choose but when the choice isn\u2019t the one you want, you guilt trip him. He should NOT have to share his phone at your in laws to entertain kids that aren\u2019t his and he should have food available he can actually eat.", "YTA\n\nSounds like Nathan and his family treat your son terribly. Why should he give up his phone for entertainment? Do they not have parents?\n\nWhy did you let your own son be treated so badly or are you that desperate that you\u2019ll let your husband\u2019s family abuse your kid?\n\nRead what you wrote. Your feelings, Nathan\u2019s feelings. Did you care how miserable your son was? No. Do you care that the same experience will make him miserable again? Nope.\n\nPeople like you, who don\u2019t understand parenting is putting their child\u2019s well-being first, should not be slowed kids. Also, putting his well-being first would be allowing him to at least alternate his Christmases.", "I'm sorry, but YTA.\n\nThe agreement is that he chooses. Last year it was with you. It would already not be weird if he went to his dad this time around just to change things up.\n\nFurthermore, y'all apparently did not accomodate him at all with his dietary choices, made him feel unwelcome, confiscated his phone for no real reason and frankly turned him into a lower class of guest.\n\nAnd you, his mom, did that.\n\nSo from this I feel like it is entirely logical that he wants to go with his dad this christmas. A cozy cottage even? Sounds nice.\n\nWhy should his dad have come to you if Mason gets to choose? Why does it matter if there's going to be traveling, why is it a big deal for a 16-year old kid to go out of town for a couple days? With his dad? \n\nAnd then you compound this entire mess by trying to guilt-trip and bully him? You *are* being over-dramatic. You *do* sound pathetic.

That post reeks of narc attitude, with the lies about his decisions, how you don\u2019t care about his last holiday and how he felt it, how you don\u2019t care about his feelings, how you threaten immediately his dad, how you say he ruined your Christmas, etc\u2026 YTA all the way", "YTA.

We have a 16 yo son together \"Mason\". I got remarried to my husband (F.) Nathan.\n\n\nMy ex husband and I used to argue on who should get Mason for the holidays back when he was little. As he got older we started letting him decide. Last year he spend Christmas with me, Nathan and my inlaws and he complained that the experience was \"terrible\" because he said Nathan and his family had little to no accomodation for his food choices (I'm not defending them but my inlaws are quite traditional when it comes to food and a bit ignorant to what types of foods Mason eats). He also said he didn't feel as welcom as the other kids in the family and that Nathan forced him to share his personal stuff like his phone so that his stepnephews could watch christmas movies.\n\n\nYesterday, during breakfast we were talking about christmas and what we were planning this year but hem out of nowhere announced that he'll be spending this Christmas with his dad at a rental christmas cottage in his favorite town. I was stunned, so was Nathan. I asked Mason when and how he agreed to this arrangement but he pointed back to what happened last christmas and said he didn't want to basically \"have another shitty holiday and be miserable\" I told him that his dad should've come to me first but he argued that he's already okayed it and so he saw no need for my opinion. We started arguing and he started complaining about me trying to ruin the experience but in response I told him that he has already ruined christmas for me and his stepdad the minhte he agreed to this arrangement. He got up and walked away after saying that I was being \"overdramatic\". Nathan just sat there and looked down.\n\n\nI had a huge argument on the phone with Mason's dad and he kept giving me an attitude and laughjng and saying that I sounded pathetic. When I told him I'd have my lawyer call him, he bbackpaddeled and said he woukdn't have done this if Mason didn't like it. He urged me to drop it and let Mason have this experience or he'll resent me for missing it. Now Mason isn't speaking to me. Nathan is trying to convince him to stay with us because without him, our christmas is ruined but he won't budge from the looks of it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He'll want to move in with his dad soon if you're not careful.", "YTA. Growing up with divorced parents they ALWAYS allowed me to make the decision which household I spent holidays with- with no guilt, weird comments, or resentment. I was given tools to build healthy relationships with my parents as I grew up, the biggest factor being that they always made sure to parent in ways which were beneficial to me, not by making decisions to guilt or spite the other parent. Your son will always have to make decisions with how he fits into two households and you are a total asshole for being hostile about it when he\u2019s already between a rock and a hard place.", "Yta. You sound mad because you thought you had free childcare over the holidays.", "Wow. No respect for the choice to gave your son when it isn\u2019t centric to you and your husband. You\u2019re such TA.

You allowed them to use his stuff against his will, did not intervene or advocate for your child, and dismissed his words when he told you about how he felt about that.\n\n\n>As he got older we started letting him decide. Last year he spend Christmas with me, Nathan and my inlaws and he complained that the experience was \"terrible\"\n\nHe wants to spend this year with his other parent. You have zero reason to say no apart from spite, pettiness, and a clear lack of concern re your child's feelings, wants, needs, or preferences. You want what you want and clearly could not care less if your son is happy, only that you are in control of him over your ex.\n\n>When I told him I'd have my lawyer call him\n\nWow you are low level. You told your child he could choose and when he chose you went off the edge.\n\n>What I meant by \"why didn't his dad come to me first\" is that he planned to take Mason out of town which is a big deal to me.\n\nDo your new inlaws live in town because last year you took your child there. He's 16. It's obvious to everyone you are being this way to punish your son for loving his father enough to want to spend time with him. It's also obvious you're very willing to make your son pay emotionally for the things you want out of life. You are the one ruining the holiday and years from now when you are alone and crying about how you haven't seen your kid since they became 18, I hope you see how you did it to yourself.", "Your son is a person not leverage to use on your ex husband. It's his dad's turn for Christmas this year. You only have blame yourself for a bad Christmas experience your son gets with new husband's family.

You wrote you and your husband let your son decide and he made his decision. You\u2019re whining that your son ruined Christmas for you and your husband is just a cheap and pathetic try to guilt your son.", "YTA, obviously. You\u2019re seriously trying to get justification for making your son feel guilty for wanting to spend Christmas with his father? A right you had given him btw. Do you realise how stressful it is to have to do this in the first place? People always say \u201cyou get 2 Christmas\u2019s\u201d as if it\u2019s a bonus, but it actually really sucks. As someone who has separated parents, we all agreed we\u2019d split it each year - so this year I\u2019ll be with my mum, next year I\u2019ll be with my dad, and the pattern continues. *That* is the best way to do this, because it avoids a-holes like you making us feel terrible and keeps everything fair.\n\nYou seriously need to apologise to your son and actually try to accommodate him if you want him to join you.

He made a choice and decided that because of last Christmas (which was spent with you!!!) he would prefer to be with his dad. \n\n\n\nInstead of letting him choose (as you claim he gets to) you get pissed off and needy and instantly start guilt tripping him. That is so wrong and so manipulative. You\u2019re teaching him that he should do what makes him unhappy to keep others happy. You\u2019re a big girl and you and your family will be fine without him for a year, especially since he was with YOU last Christmas! \n\n\n\nTelling him that he ruined your Christmas is a horrible things to say and if you continue this shit, you\u2019ll probably never spend another Christmas with him again. So maybe apologize and keep in mind that he (as you said as well) is absolutely old enough to make this decision for himself.", "You and your husband agreed to let your son decide where he wants to be for Christmas. Your family, and you as well, in your own words did very little to make last Christmas enjoyable for him and didn\u2019t even provide food that accommodated your son\u2019s diet. This Christmas he has decided to go with his father. \n\nEven if it wasn\u2019t your son\u2019s decision where he spent Christmas and you went by a schedule where you trade off each year this isn\u2019t even your year to have your son. \n\nYou\u2019re upset your son chose to go with his father who it sounds like is making an effort to make Christmas special for your son. His father also didn\u2019t get to have your son for last Christmas. \n\nNow that your son has let you know he doesn\u2019t want to spend this Christmas with you you have chosen to start an argument with your ex, threatened legal action in response to the disappointment your experiencing. \n\nWhat is a lawyer or judge going to do differently? You\u2019ll spend thousands and hours of both of your time to what end? Why would a judge or lawyers prevent your son from either choosing where he wants to spend Christmas or trading off Christmas between his parents houses? You had him for Christmas last year so why would you expect to have him this year even if it wasn\u2019t his choice? That you are unable to respect your son\u2019s decision is likely to reflect poorly on you in court and that your family and you won\u2019t even make simple dietary accommodations for your son reflects even more poorly on you in this instance. \n\nWhat you seem to be losing perspective of here is that your relationship with your son seems to depend more on your ability to force him to do what you want than anything else. That\u2019s only going to be the case for a few more years. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to spend your remaining years before he can really decide the type of relationship he has with you building a relationship that he values as well as you? \n\nCoercing and threatening everyone involved in choices your son makes is a very poor way to behave. Making it clear to your son you and your family don\u2019t care about his diet or personal space at holidays sends a clear enough message to him and whether you like it or not his opinion matters a lot. So I\u2019d suggest re-examining your priorities if you want to him to choose to be with you for Christmas again in the future. \n\nYTA", "Yta, a pattern of his then yours had already been set, also you were allowing ao  to choose.

It sounds like he was used to entertain the younger kids while the adults got a break.\n\nNo judge will take you serious that a 16 year old boy wishes to spend Christmas with his father because he spent last Christmas with his mother, threatening legal action will just further strain your relationship with your son.\n\nYou care more about your husband being upset than your own childs comforts and happiness, you are both adults using guilt tripping techniques on a minor.\n\nHe has given you more than 5 weeks notice, that is plenty and he is travelling with his other parent, you are being controlling and paranoid.\n\nMason deserves a Merry Christmas!", "YTA.

There is nothing wrong with that except your attitude.\n\n2.) He spent last year with you and it was a horrible experience for him because he couldn't eat and was forced to share his personal electronic device. He also told you he didn't feel welcome.

Why in the world would your son want to spend another holiday like that when you clearly don't care about what he wants?\n\n3.)

Fewer presents compared to everyone else, no traditions to participate in, and expected to entertain the younger kids instead of do things I wanted to.

I insist on it because holidays are so magical for kids. My ex's family does the holidays to a Hallmark movie level. That's what I want for them. I want them to wake up to a beautiful holiday that they will enjoy. So, do I want my kids for T-day and Christmas? Of course I do. I cry every year. BUT I will not do anything to stand in the way of their enjoyment of the holidays. And I certainly would never emotionally manipulate them into choosing me.
