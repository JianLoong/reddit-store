I also am on the spectrum, this is relevant for later.\n\nI have lived my entire life around the capital city of my country, very busy and loads of different people and cultures there which I loved.\n\nI met my SO 5 years ago. I just finished Uni and lived with my dad. I wanted to move out but didn't have the funds at the time. I fell in love with my SO, who lived in a small town two hours from my home. After Uni I got a pretty good job ver quickly.\n\nWhen I met my MIL, there was already tension. She just did not like me at all. To some extend I understand, because I find it hard to connect or express myself well, so at first I thought it was that. She hated my hair (black dyed with a pink strand) my tattoos. Again I thought it's an opinion and eventhough hurtful she has the right to disagree with me.\n\nMy MIL stated that her entire family has always lived nearby and that unlike my family she'd do anything to protect hers and keep everyone close. That felt like an attack on my family, especially my grandparents who raised me when my parents couldn't and where like angels in my eyes. \n\nWe mentioned that when we saved up we wanted to live together and buy a house. My SO had a house of his own, but it just wasn't future proof. My ML immediately jumped on me, basically telling me that I was after my SO financials, and I was taking him away from her.\nI asked her. Why it was such a problem for my SO to potentially move away a bit, but that I had to drop my family and that that was ok? (At the time both my grandparents were still alive)\nI was ignored.\n\nWe have ended up buying a house in the beginning of this year, and we love it. It is 15 mins from my MIL and still almost 2 hours from my family, but I also build a life here. My MIL only congratulated my SO with HIS house. My SO told her it was our house and I own half of it.\nShe refused to acknowledge that.\n\nOne day she came by our house un invited and unannounced so I was home alone and about to leave for a friend. She demanded she wanted in because she wanted to see if her baby was living in a clean home and was fed well.\nI told her to leave a few times and closed the door on her. She kept screaming at the door and ended up starting an entire family feud.\n\nAith\n\n*Edit: her baby is my SO who is in his 30s not my child I have none.\n\n*Edit: Me being on the spectrum is not a carte blanche for potential rude behaviour, however, my MIL has no understanding for me as a person and sees of me as something broken. Also, I am fully aware being on the spectrum is not a carte blanche, that's why I doubted so much if it was just me\n\n*Edit: MIL refers to people on the spectrum as \"my kind\" as if we are aliens.", "created_utc": 1679399399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xehox/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_into_our_house/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she has a key you may want to change the locks. \n\nYou deserve to feel safe and respected in your home. Your partner will need to be consistent and supportive in these boundaries. The good news is, if your partner does step up, everything may improve for the better. I didn't get on great with my in laws at first, but everything turned around when my husband told them they had to treat me with respect.", "NTA.  She sounds so disrespectful.  I think in your own house you are entitled to not want someone who clearly dislikes you in your house when you are not there.  I wouldn't trust her one bit in there alone if it were me.  And it sounds like she is looking to find evidence to make you look bad.  In fact, the whole thing may have been a manipulative ploy to make herself the victim of \"your cruelty\" so you'd look bad in front of everyone. Who knows, but based on her comments she definitely seems toxic.\n\nYour SO may feel differently about who can be in the house when you aren't there though, so it might be worth discussing to get on the same page about it, but in the initial reaction totally NTA.\n\nEdit: the more I think about it the more I am annoyed by \"she wanted to see if her baby was living in a clean home and was fed well.\" As if it is your job to clean the place and feed your SO instead of a grown adult doing those things for themselves or that you would do those things together.  She appears to see you as her servant-in-law at most.", "NTA\n\nYou have a r/justnomil on your hands.  You made the right first step, refusing her demands.  She doesn't get unannounced visits.  Make that 100% clear with your SO.  Also, he is the one to call MIL and tell her that directly.  Lots more information and examples in the rubredit I linked.  This is YOUR home, not hers.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA, but I think you need to discuss this with your partner and they then need to talk to her and very clearly set out the boundaries.\n\ne.g. \n\n*  IF you want to come to our home, you need to call first and only come if one of us specifically tells you it is OK\n* If you show up without warning / without one of us having told you it is OK, then you may not be able to come in.\n* If you visit or spend time with us, you must be polite to us both. That means not making nasty or critical comments about OP, her appearance, or her family or upbringing, and respecting her.\n* If you come to our home, you need to recognise that it is our home, not yours. We don't have the same house rules as you, and you need to respect ours. That means that there are things you are comfortable with guests in your home doing, that may not be OK in our home. For instance, even though you are family, we are not comfortable with you showing up unannounced or going into bedroom s or other private parts of the house. \n\nAn d it's Ok if you and your partner decide that you would prefer for any meetings to be in her home not yours. But you need to discuss with him and agree on boundaries you and he are both comfortable with, then he needs to be the one to speak to his mom (and if necessary, wider family)", "NTA also, SO needs to set her straight. There should be boundaries.", "NTA\n\nIt is your home. Your safe space. A happy place. She doesn't get to take that away from you. She doesn't have the right to be there and be rude to you.\n\nAlso, why doesn't your SO stand up for you. He should make it very clear to his mother that this kind of behavior isn't acceptable.", "NTA Your MIL can come to your house to see \u201cher baby\u201d when she is invited or by appointment, and when \u201cher baby\u201d is there to receive and entertain her. \n\nYou can grey rock her.", "Nta. This is toxic and weird of her", "Oh she's one of them.........There is no reason why she has to feel like she needs to compete with you. I hate the she is trying to steal my son from me dynamic.

That was weird.", "NTA She sounds unbearable and smothering towards your SO. You should have probably bought a house further than 15 mins away from her. What does your SO say about all this? Does he stick up for you?", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds like a nightmare. Your SO should make the decision for you both to go low contact with her and only see her when you absolutely need to. \n\nJust FYI if you have kids with this man, how she treats your husband will also be how she treats your children and you will still be hated, or it will get worse.", "NTA", "NTA.

In this case it's MILs fault , she's jealous.

Your mother-in-law is attempting to show you up in your own house which you were not OK with, obviously, I wouldn\u2019t either. Some cultures and families are rabbid about tight family relationships and living close together, but changes do happen, and clearly she\u2019s not OK with that. It will be a fight until your significant other sets the rules. But even then, it will always be your fault that the status quo has been changed, you are in for a fight. This sucks.

Look up emotional incest.", "I think MIL can't accept that her baby is grown up and still see him as a child.  That's why she calls him a baby and has to check on his living situation, because OP is his babysitter and MIL has to make sure babysitter's doing her job.  She has no respect for OP, just sees her as a servant.  Too bad they already bought a house so close to MIL, 'cause moving far away would be the best way to stop this behavior.", "I honestly didn't notice that detail and it seems completely irrelevant, I'm not on the spectrum and I'd have acted the same way if my mother in law tried doing that after a long history of negative and disrespectful words and actions.

People who are on the spectrum struggle with expression and connecting with others.\n\nOP is definitely NTA.", "But it *is* relevant.

But I also know how hard it is to stand up against your parents", "I agree that being on the spectrum doesn't give someone carte blanche  to be an AH, but spectrum or no, the MIL doesn't respect the OP, and the OP is entirely reasonable for not letting MIL in the home alone.", "What do you think OP has done here that makes her the AH?", "MIL may have this mindset with all of her family. The \"protect [them]and keep them close\" attitude OP mentioned.\n\nIts children, young children really, that need that. Adults (generally) don't need a parent protecting them. They need support. They generally don't need to be kept close either.\n\nAnd a part of the teen years should be allowing them to step out on their own. First for shorter periods of time. Then longer. So that when they hit college age they can potentially move out on their own, or go to a school halfway across the country (or the world).", "But in no part of the story did she say \"this affected me particularly because i'm on the spectrum\", so it never \"came up\".

She demanded to be allowed in and expressly stated that this was to check up on her son's policing conditions. This is clearly not a woman who is going to respond to a polite, tactful no. If she was, she would have left the moment OP told her she was jut going out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing on the spectrum can mean that someone finds it harder to identify whether another person's behaviour was genuinely unreasonable or inappropriate.
