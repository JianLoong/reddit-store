I've been trying to help out but you need to remember that you chose to take on foster kids without asking me how much I was willing to be involved. You have been asking more than I am prepared to give. I didn't  volunteer, I was drafted. Because those kids don't deserve more instability due to your failure to think ahead, I'm willing to go on as we have for a little longer. You need to figure this out by May 15th, because I will no longer be your on call childcare/transport/etc at a moment's notice outside of what I can agree is an unpredictable crisis.\" (Unpredictable ... like if the arranged pickup person gets in a wreck on the way there or that pickup person's parent/spouse/kid was rushed to hospital.)*\n\n*Clear boundary setting, clear date of implementation that should enable her to get her ducks in a row without the kids being left in the lurch.

Might want to do your parents, too. Listen to messages immediately to determine if *you* feel there is a crisis. No crisis? Either delay callback long enough that she figures something else out or text back something like, \"Sorry, I'm not available. Good luck with that!\"*\n\n*(Seriously, though, seems like I remember there being all sorts of rules about foster kids and who/when/how long they could be left to someone else's care. Pretty sure you'd have to have been vetted/screened/background checked and have to have expressed willingness to be her backup for those kids to be in your care or you wouldn't even be an option within the rules where I live.

That\u2019s what we have to deal with, it\u2019s not just ppl saying they don\u2019t like us it\u2019s actual discriminatory acts. Children don\u2019t face any of that.

If someone says they specifically don\u2019t like a kid, like they walk up to them and say I don\u2019t like you because you\u2019re a child, I of course don\u2019t support that and if they said that to a disabled child it would be wrong.

And a medical diagnosis won\u2019t suddenly make me love all children and want one. I don\u2019t like kids. I don\u2019t like them as a whole.
