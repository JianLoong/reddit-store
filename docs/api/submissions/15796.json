I've been trying to help out but you need to remember that you chose to take on foster kids without asking me how much I was willing to be involved. You have been asking more than I am prepared to give. I didn't  volunteer, I was drafted. Because those kids don't deserve more instability due to your failure to think ahead, I'm willing to go on as we have for a little longer. You need to figure this out by May 15th, because I will no longer be your on call childcare/transport/etc at a moment's notice outside of what I can agree is an unpredictable crisis.\" (Unpredictable ... like if the arranged pickup person gets in a wreck on the way there or that pickup person's parent/spouse/kid was rushed to hospital.)*\n\n*Clear boundary setting, clear date of implementation that should enable her to get her ducks in a row without the kids being left in the lurch.

Might want to do your parents, too. Listen to messages immediately to determine if *you* feel there is a crisis. No crisis? Either delay callback long enough that she figures something else out or text back something like, \"Sorry, I'm not available. Good luck with that!\"*\n\n*(Seriously, though, seems like I remember there being all sorts of rules about foster kids and who/when/how long they could be left to someone else's care. Pretty sure you'd have to have been vetted/screened/background checked and have to have expressed willingness to be her backup for those kids to be in your care or you wouldn't even be an option within the rules where I live.
