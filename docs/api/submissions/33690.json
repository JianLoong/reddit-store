I haven't had to opportunity to make many friends. I decided that it may be best for me to get a cat because I've always loved having animals around, and I thought that it would make me a little happier. I texted my current roommate, who had told me prior that she would be happy if I got a cat, and I asked her if she was okay with me getting one. In the past, my roommate has shown that she loves cats, I've seen her playing with them and she has owned them in the past. My roommate and I have had a couple of falling outs because she likes to control everything that I do.\n\nExamples are:\n\n* I have to ask her permission before I bring someone back to the dorm (she doesn't)\n* I'm not allowed to eat in the room\n* My side of the room has to be kept pristine (her side doesn't matter)\n* She uses all of my stuff without asking, and I had to buy everything for our room\n* She likes to tell me what to wear, and if I don't listen to her, she'll make a snarky remark\n* She asks me to wake her up in the morning, do her laundry, and clean the whole room (and I usually do to avoid conflict)\n\nMy roommate texted me back and told me that I wasn't allowed to get a cat, and I did not have her permission to get it. She said that she felt like the responsibility would fall onto her if I got it and said that she doesn't want to live with a cat in our room.
