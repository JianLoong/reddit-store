Not everyone had a good sex education or parents who actually talked to their children about sex.\n\nSo YTA because I think it's important to not make someone feel like an idiot for their lack of knowledge. You'd be surprised at the misinformation people have in regards to women's bodies and sex.", "As an American (\ud83e\udd22) I know we have a fucked up system for educating students about sex.

Because sex education really really sucks here and it's much kinder to politely correct people who have misinformation than it is to use it as a chance to preen yourself.", "NTA- I would have reacted similarly. Though i grew up in Texas and know some people are truly ignorant to their bodies due to our lack of adequate sex ed and religious upbringings, its still shocking. her reaction is largely out of embarrassment. that could have happened if you had responded differently, too.", "YTA, just because her information was wrong doesn't give you permission to be rude.", "NTA.

You were a jerk, but I get it.\n\nUnfortunately she clearly is uneducated, and I don't really want her trying to pee out sperm as a tactic forever, so if someone could use this opportunity to teach her about BC, that'd be great.\n\nYTA. Now go do us all a favor and connect that girl with some educational materials!", "NTA. You cant expect a random person to teach basic human anatomy and biological processes to an adult.

There is too much stupid going around these days and we really need to nip it in the bud where we can. Thank you for doing important things.", "YTA.

I wanna see everyone be perfectly civil and wary of opponents feelings against an unhinged statement.", "NTA, I\u2019m having trouble seeing where you were really even that mean besides the \u201cwtf\u201d reaction, which seems like a valid initial reaction of shock to what she said. You were at a party, not in a confessional booth where you\u2019re waiting and prepared to hear wild things with an understanding demeanor.

Sounds like she was not given a chance to learn about her own body as a teen, and her doctor doesnt explain things well enough.", "YTA - how about we all inform you how stupid you are for needing to check if you're an AH after you hurt someone's feelings? Lol you'd better hope you NEVER EVER say anything wrong or dumb in the future because to that woman, that was a question she legit didn't know the answer to, the same way how someday, you'll say something that leads people to pause and think \"Is this dude serious? What a moron...\"", "YTA. We don\u2019t shame people for not having a good education in something so important.

You can't know what you've not been taught. \n\nSome people grow up in \"abstinence only\" environments where talking about sex is not only discouraged, but they even get *punished* for asking questions. Sex is only one example. And so, they stop asking questions. So they don't learn. And so they reach adulthood not knowing this stuff. *That's* how it happens. \n\nPerhaps don't assume that someone has been educated on these topics purely on the basis of the country they live in. If you're American, some people aren't taught about the civil war, they're taught about \"the war of northern aggression\". https://eu.jacksonville.com/story/news/nation-world/2017/08/22/how-civil-war-taught-school-depends-where-you-live/15766977007/  Are you going to blame people for trusting their teachers, too?\n\nJust because something seems obvious to you, doesn't mean it is to everyone. Some people are discouraged from learning. Some people are taught wrong. \n\nYou can either be someone who encourages people to keep learning (without making them feel stupid), or you can be someone who makes that person feel stupid, which will *discourage* them from asking questions and learning. Think about the *result* you want. \n\nFor example, one topic posed on AskReddit (I think?) a while back, was asking Americans who used to be racist/fly the confederate flag, why they did so/why they changed and no longer did. One person commented, what changed their minds was a black woman encouraging them to read the letters from the rebelling states, that outlined to the union why they were rebelling. (Hint: they all cite slavery as a reason.) He hadn't been *taught* it was to do with slavery. \n\nSo, you can decide if you want to feel superior to someone on account of their ignorance, or if you want to help/teach them to be *less* ignorant.", "Or you could just be nice.
