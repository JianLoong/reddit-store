I thought her need to display her \"work\" was egocentric of her and called her a narcissist, I know that comment wasn't unnecessary but I was only trying to help her have a nice looking modern living room with maybe some PROFESSIONAL art.

You don't need to help her with decorating bc it doesn't appear that she wants your help with that. \n\nI helped my mom modernize some things in my parents house, but when my mom wanted to keep something I didn't necessarily like... you know what happened?  I kept my mouth shut and she kept what she wanted in their house.", "I am 25 and i hate all the modern aesthetic stuff. We don\u2019t need an Alexa, multiple streaming services, etc. And modern decorations are so bland and boring, at least her art and doilies show her real personality and not something that makes her like everyone else.", "Because the help with technology and painting was wanted, while the help with decor was not.\n\nIt's not help when you're saying \"Your taste sucks\".", "Why the fuck does she need to modernize? If she is happy, leave her alone. Streaming is cheaper than buying new dvds constantly. There is a real benefit. What is the benefit to new decor that matches your tastes instead of hers? Are you going to give her the $ for new paintings for her living room?", "Damn you're as narcissistic as they come", "I taught my grandma how to use a kindle. Her house is out dated but I didn't say shit cause she loved it. It made her happy so I was happy.", "Modern is usually a good thing for technology. It has no benefit in the area of aesthetics. Some people like old-fashioned things. Trying to keep your decor \"modern\" is a recipe for blindly following trends and needing to \"update\" every decade. Some people prefer a timeless look, or they prefer to use their own judgment and make their house look the way they want. Many of us find \"modern\" decor to be ridiculous, slavishly following trends that will be out of date before any of the furniture has worn out.", "If your sister and her friends are looking for a fancy aesthetic experience, they can pay for a hotel or rental. If they\u2019re staying in someone\u2019s home, they get whatever decor the homeowner wants.", "Based on your post and comments, YTA and need to remove possibly and accept you are both. Either nature or nurture aside, this was not the time to give your honest assessment of your mom's artwork she made hanging in her own home. Unless you have a degree and experience in therapy, stay in your lane and appreciate still having a mom to visit.", "I think we need to see pics of Emo Gary!!", "I'm honestly getting the sense that OP's projecting their issues onto us.", "Right? The irony. \n\nAlso, who TF thinks they have authority to tell someone what art they can and can't display *in their own house?* \n\nYTA", "Also, OP, please learn how to spell AMATEUR, please.\n\nIt's her space and she likes it how she likes it. Stop telling her what her taste and aesthetic should be.\n\nYTA", "I was wondering if it was actually crocheted  by HER grandmother and was a precious keepsake (or tatted- my grandma taught me how to tat and I forgot most of it).  Things displayed in a home can have more meaning than whatever the current trends are.", "Right.\n\nMy mum gave me two little coaster-sized doilies. She had them since the '80s.\n\nI moved to the U.S and they now sit on my coffee table. They used to sit on her coffee table.\n\nI don't know when, or if, I'll ever see my parents in person again. I have a few older things of hers around the house. \n\nPeople enjoy having \"dated\" stuff for their own reasons. It's personal. This includes artwork painted by the owner. It might've been her first piece and she wanted to memorialise it.", "This made me laugh \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 your heart is looking pretty ugly, OP. Maybe focus on changing that.", "Right? I'd take the whole \"cottagecore\" aesthetic over today's blandness any day of the week. And you have to assume someone handcrafted those doilies too, there is significantly more value in that or even mom's artwork than cheap junk you'd get at Home Goods or Walmart. OP is totally YTA. Having bad manners is a lot tackier than whatever they think their mom's home looks like."]}
