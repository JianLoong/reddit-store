I\u2019m also married to my loving husband (34M), and expecting our second child.But the thing is my son Jayden is not biologically related to me or my husband.We adopted him from my step sister.\n\nHere is little background: Melissa my step sister had an affair with a bad guy at a time ,he committed bad crimes and she knew it from the start yet decided to stay with him because as she claimed \u201che was accused, he is innocent\u201d. It\u2019s not true ,he was jailed for eight years.But anyways I tried to keep my distance with them only to recive a call one day from Melissa after she gave birth to Jayden. To keep it short she asked me to adopt him because she didn\u2019t wanted to ruin her life with a child and that her boyfriend didn\u2019t wanted kids either and she said that if I don\u2019t adopt him now then he will go down the foster care . She even added how \u201c I don\u2019t want him and I don\u2019t want him to ruin my life nor my relationship\u201d\n\nI adopted Jayden because I fall in love with that little boy the moment I saw him and my husband was not against it since he knew how important family is for me. Till now my husband treats my little Jayden as his son and Jayden adores him .\n\nBut few day ago I got a call from Melissa ,who mind you didn\u2019t contact us for 2 years since she gave her rights up and made it clear to me when I asked her back in a day if she wants to keep in touch with Jayden she said \u201ckeep that child away from me, don\u2019t u dare to tell him that I\u2019m his mother\u201c. \n\nShe called me to ask if she and her now husband could have Jayden for a Christmas because she wanted spend time with him. And also confessed to me that she was told that she can\u2019t have no more kids,she was diagnosed infertility as far as I understand. And now she wants Jayden because she feels that she deserves it and that Jayden deserves to have real mom in his life \n\nNow issue comes with a fact that , A) she lives with her husband whom I don\u2019t trust especially after knowing that he has history of being abusive ,B) Melissa has record of using drugs . I don\u2019t trust those people,like at all . \n\nI said to her that \u201cI let Jayden spend time with u only after he learns how to talk properly\u201d and she was angry by that saying that she is a victim and that she is his mom and that I took her child away from her. She called me an asshole for keeping Jayden away from her \n\nnot to mention that she said during the same call that she wants Jayden to meet his real dad because \u201cur husband never going to be his real father only father he has is Mike\u201dand she said that she planning to change his family name and first name because \u201cu took that right away from me to call him the way I want\u201d \n\nMy parents agrees with her saying that she needs her child back and that she already suffered enough and that adopted kids deserve to live with their \u201creal parents\u201d\n\nSo AITA for refusing to let my child have alone time with them?", "created_utc": 1670669067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhpgkf/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_to_spend_time_with/", "score": 261, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can quickly see this turning into a custody battle. \n\nPlease! If everything you\u2019ve said about how she\u2019s referred to him is true then she does not want a real relationship with that child, they want a shiny thing to \u2018look at\u2019. Yes, as the \u2018real\u2019 parents one day they might meet him but that needs to be a decision for when he\u2019s older and more aware and it can be his personal decision (assuming he\u2019ll be told one day by you he\u2019s adopted). But regardless her deciding she wants him know only now that they know they can\u2019t have kids is not okay and not the way you care for a child. Just all the wrong reasons there for this and it does not sound like a health or safe environment for him which is what your priority needs to be.", "NTA, please tell me that you have a fully legal adoption and proof that she terminated all parental rights.  She and her boyfriend should not be allowed to be alone with your child and frankly I would be cautious of your parents as well since they don't seem to respect your parental rights.", "INFO: So you legally adopted him, like signed the papers and everything? There would be no fight if they wanted to take this to court because this was a contractual agreement, not just verbal?\n\nIf so, NTA obviously", "NTA and if possible get a restraining order.\n\nJayden is your child now. That's also where he has a stable and loving family. It's legally yours to love and raise.\n\nIf sister is infertile, she has the option to adopt as well, and she will love the kid just as much as a bio kid. \n\nLet social services decide whether this couple is fit for adoption. That will be interesting to watch.\n\nA child is not a bong that you pass around in a circle. The boy is 2 and he had a mother and father, you and your husband. Be firm with your parents that no way you are letting your boy go anywhere, and if they can't accept that, you're cutting ties.", "NTA but I really, really wouldn't listen to your sister about that \"don't tell him he's adopted\" sentiment she expressed at first. It should never be a surprise to someone that they are adopted. All that, \"wait till they are 18\", \"wait till they are old enough to understand\" is decades out of date now.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/adoption-disclosure-study/594496/\n\nKnowing since before age 3, in other words having no memories of not knowing they were adopted, tends to lead to the best outcomes for the child.\n\nI definitely agree with you about not letting him see her now, and waiting till he is older like you said, meaning he can say if he even wants to meet her. But I would be scared any kind of scenario when he doesn't know he is adopted and she was bio mum when he does meet her could back fire spectacularly.\n\nEdit: the more I think about it the more I wouldn't do a meeting until your son is like 10, it happens at your house or a public place, and sis/her parter/your parents aren't alone with him for a second. They all sound like they would try and kidnap him or something with the things they said in this post.", "NTA. You adopted him, you are his parents. You get to decide who he spends time with. And someone who will confuse him and openly plans to undermine your parenting is someone you should protect your child from.", "NTA for refusing...YTA if you put YOUR son into that kind of environment. You and the husband are parents. Continue to make good decisions.", "NTA.\n\nShe voluntarily gave up her rights to the child, and Jayden in every sense is you and your husbands son.\nKeep Jayden away from your sister and might I suggest even your parents.\n\nI also suggest contacting your lawyer to ensure that you are well within your rights and also restrict your sister from being able to come in contact with Jayden.", "NTA. You and your husband are his parents- point blank, end of story. She has no right to come back into his life two years later and disrupt his world like that. I personally would be fearful that if you gave her any time alone with him you might not get him back. Do what you have to to maintain your family.", "NTA AND GET A LAWYER LIKE YESTERDAY", "NTA\n\n She has no legal right to the child, at least not by U.S. laws. I would get a lawyer because she definitely seems like she will take this to court regardless. Cut anyone who agrees with your sister out of your life. You need to explain to Jayden that he is adopted but that isn't a bad thing. Do this early like other comments have suggested. Good luck.", "NTA. She burned her bridges with Jayden when she said she didn't want to ruin her life with a child, and that she didn't want Jayden to learn under any circumstances he was related to her. She can't go backsies on this because she gave up her one chance. Jayden has a real mother, you, because you are the one raising him and being in his life the way he needs a mother to be. Melissa forfeited the right to be his mother, and has no emotional or legal connection to him.\n\nWhat's most important here is for Jayden, and he needs stability if he can get it. He gets that by staying with you and your husband. There's also your very understandable concerns with Melissa's choice in partner. She thinks her feelings are more important than the safety of a toddler who can't defend himself. If the adoption was official, no way she's getting any sort of custody with her history, or with Mike's history. Don't let her have physical access either, kidnapping is something she seems likely to be capable of.", "NTA\n\nYou are legally Jayden\u2019s guardian. Melissa gave that right up two years ago, going as far as saying she wanted nothing to do with him. Now, she may have changed her mind since then, but there\u2019s not much she can do about it. Since you don\u2019t trust her with him, you can dictate no visitation. You can also dictate limited visitation if you\u2019d like. Though, I wouldn\u2019t leave Jayden alone with Melissa for even a second.\n\nAs for your husband not being a real father? Pff. Your husband is more Jayden\u2019s father than Jayden\u2019s sperm donor (biological father).", "NTA. Don't listen to your parents or your step sister, you adopted him, you are his real mother. You get to decide who he spends time with. Completely ignore your step-sisters and husbands feelings, put you and your son first.", "And...let's say you DID give Jayden to your sister? Who's to say she won't get tired of having him around (the reality of a toddler being way different than how she might imagine it)? Or what if she and Mike end up pregnant and so she no longer \"needs\" Jayden? She'd get rid of him in a heartbeat. You cannot trust this woman to give the child what he needs. YOU are his parents now, and Jayden stays with you.", "You aren't the ah and know you need to keep your son away from them. You have all the legal documents so they have nothing to stand on.  However as someone who was adopted what your parents said cut deep. My adopted parents are my real parents. They are the ones who stepped up to the plate to care for me and love me. Not the woman who birthed me or the guy she had sex with. To me being a parent means doing that job not just creating them.", "NTA. Keep YOUR child as far away from your step sister as possible! You and your husband are YOUR sons parents. She gave up all rights to YOUR child the minute she signed the paperwork. Cut off contact with her immediately and, if your family cannot support you and YOUR child, cut contact with them also. I would keep any and all correspondence you receive from your stepsister concerning YOUR child. You may have to contact the police. She sounds unhinged and may try to kidnap YOUR son.", "Melissa still sounds like a hot mess. NTA and you need to keep her and her enablers at arms length from you, your son and family. Your son is not a yoyo for her to jerk around. Your son should know he's adopted and any age appropriate information. When he is older such as 10/11 then it maybe appropriate for him to know whom is birth mother is and if he is ready then contact can commence. Right now doing so will be confusing to the child. It's your job to protect your son.", "Call a lawyer NOW and make sure this never happens. Frankly I wouldn't want even supervised visits because the very first thing she is going to say is \"I'm your real mom.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA - PLEASE PROTECT THAT CHILD. Edit: you have the right idea waiting until he can verbally tell you how he feels and he can tell you if any abuse happens. Right now only you can advocate for him and I think you are making the correct choice no matter how much flak you get from the rest of the family.", "NTA, she signed her rights away. I'd also be asking for documentation saying she's infertile as that could just be a ploy to tug at your heart strings.", "ESH.\n\nI don't get people who adopt kids from family member. It's always a recipee for disaster and I'm really glad it's not even possible in my country.\n\nThat kid is a human being and not a car that you borrowed. She gave up her rights and she is not entitled to anything when it comes to the kid.\n\nBut now the kid is screwed because someone is bound to tell him about his biological mother and unless you cut contact with your family and move so they cannot find a way to contact you, they are, especially the biological mother, going to tell them their version of things which is going to make you look like the bad guy.\n\nThis is what happens when you go into an adoption with unstable people...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's your responsibilty to keep him safe.\n\nI worked with kids that had parents like these, don't let them near them. Before they can meet (again) YOUR son, they have to show that they changed. They don't get the cherries just because they demand them. Don't ever let your son alone with them, do not even leave him with them to go to the toilet.\n\nAdopted kids live with their real parents, because you aren't a parent just because you fucked someone who gave birth 10 months later, parenthood is looking out for your kid and helping him grow up, keeping him safe and everything else.

Should kids be able to live with their birth parents? Obviously, but that requires that those birth parents aren\u2019t involved with drugs/crime, demonstrate emotional maturity and understanding, and are able to put the needs of their child above their own.\n\nSo no, birth parents aren\u2019t always best. \n\nI hope this adoption is all legal - with the adoption did she give up her parental rights, or does she retain those? Regardless - you and your husband are the only parents that little boy knows, your home is his home, and you owe your feckless step sister nothing. \n\nIf you have any evidence of her messages about giving him up etc. it might help to gather them together in case she does legally challenge, but being absent for two whole years is not a good look. Not to mention her intention to introduce him to his real dad, who if I\u2019m following correctly is a convicted criminal? All that\u2019s happened here is she found out there\u2019s never going to be any future babies to play house with her now husband, so she\u2019s trying to yank back the only child she has, regardless of whether it is in his best interests, or at all kind to him to do so.", "Even when he can talk and walk Id not let them near your kid.

You can't just hand him over to someone who abandoned him without good reason.  She's not a stable person and if her husband is abusive to her, he'll probably be abusive to Jayden as well.  The husband isn't even Jayden's \"real dad\".  Then again, Melissa isn't Jayden's \"real mom\", either.  You're Jayden's real mom and your husband is Jayden's real dad.\n\nSome parents feel bad for their kids who screw up and, in an effort to help those kids turn their lives around, end up favoring the screw ups over the responsible kids.
