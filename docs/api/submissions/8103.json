Letting her eat something at the same time can also help. Anything that engages her throat is going to lessen the sensation in her ears because those muscles are connected. If your daughter is scared it\u2019s going to hurt reassure her that it won\u2019t. Of course it\u2019s stressful but you\u2019re the adult. Maybe at the end you both get a treat though? Ice cream or some tea.", "YTA. She's a kid who is sick. Clearly this is something that makes her even more uncomfortable. You insulting her sure as hell didn't help", "Of course you were in the wrong for yelling. Apologise to her.\n\nAnd my suggestion for getting her to take them is simply to have a little more patience. Five minutes and you were yelling at her?! Come the fuck on. That's not long enough to calm down from 'freaking out' and you know it. Give her an actual chance to get used to the idea. Can she possibly give herself the drops as well? Might take a lot of the anxiety about it away for her (you try lying still while waiting for someone else to drop something in your ear and see if it doesn't make you flinch with anticipation...)", "YTA. Instead of screaming you could have asked her what was wrong. A conversation and hug probably would have put her mind at ease. You owe her an apology. Speak to the doctor to see if there is an alternative.", "Let me get this straight....\n\nYour daughter is in pain and is scared. So you yelled at her not to be a baby? That is an insult more at home on a playground than from a mother to her daughter. \n\nThis isn't an advice sub, so don't ask for it here. YTA. \n\nHow about calling a doctor for advice instead of verbally accosting a 10 year old.", "**YTA**\n\nFirst of all, as others have noted, don't heat up medications without clearing it with the pharmacist.  I assume that the ear drops are cold because they're refrigerated, and as much as cold drops may be uncomfortable, you should probably check that it's safe to even leave them out to come to room temperature before administering them. If they're refrigerated it's because THEY NEED TO BE KEPT AT A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE TO WORK. If you put the whole vial of medication in the microwave, you've likely ruined it, so this entire post is pointless because now you need a new prescription. \n\nSecondly, it's pretty obvious that YTA for yelling at a sick child for being fussy and literally calling her names. Everyone gets that it's frustrating for you as a parent, but not only is it just plain mean, it doesn't even achieve your purpose. Did yelling at her and calling her names make her more compliant? No. It just hurt her feelings and made her more upset. Whereas if you'd taken a minute to talk to her about it, tell her that you understood that it was uncomfortable but it would be over fast and make her feel better, and at least she didn't have to taste anything gross, you would at least have maybe achieved your objective.", "Holy shit. Yeah. YTA. Big time. She was terrified and you belittled her. And then didn\u2019t even give her the damn ear drops. You just dragged it out, scaring her longer, called her names, and left her with untreated ear pain. \n\nYou should apologize to her for it. It would be the right thing to do. \n\nFrom one parent to another: Sometimes you just have to gently hold them steady, administer the drops as quickly as possible, and then comfort them after. The anxiety of the anticipation is the worst part and sometimes they just can\u2019t overcome it.", "YTA.\n\nGo back to the ENT and tell them how you've been administering the medicine and the problems you're having. There may be an alternative that they can suggest.\n\nFor example, I had bad ear infections as a kid and they would soak a cotton ball in medicine and put that in my ear so they didn't have to wrestle me to take ear drops. Maybe they have better ideas than that these days.", "Easy barometer for AHness: if you are screaming and calling someone names, especially if that person is a sick child under your care, yes, YTA.", "YTA - well yeah, you yelled at a ten year old and made them cry. This was not the way to handle this situation. \n\nIf you want advice im sure theres a plethora of advice subs for parents", "YTA you didn\u2019t give her antibiotics because it was too stressful? That\u2019s neglectful AF. \n\nAnd yeah YTA for yelling - it didn\u2019t help your cause, you still didn\u2019t get your child their antibiotics, and all you taught your daughter was 1) if I\u2019m frustrated enough I can yell at people and 2) if I throw a big enough fit things won\u2019t happen.", "When I was your daughter's age I was horrible in the event I needed eye drops.  Not once did my dad have to resort to shouting at me, calling me a baby, etc to get it done, and I eventually got to a point where I could do them myself if I needed to.  Massive YTA here.", "I remember being there\u2026.on the couch, sick, and Mom struggling to get those teaming drops on my ears. \n\nI HATED the sensation of them going into my ear canal. I mean, HATED. I cried. I probably screamed. What I remember is Mom backing off and being patient. Truth be told, there was also probably a bourbon close by. Who could blame her? \n\nI remember her soothing me. Telling me she knew it bothered me. Somehow she got those horrible drops in both of my ears each time. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think you should microwave the drops. Just put them in a pan of warm/hot water to get them ready. The drops might\u2019ve been too hot. \n\nIs your daughter on antibiotics, too?\n\nIf my mom had snapped at me like you did to your daughter, I\u2019m not sure how I would\u2019ve reacted. \n\nTake a break. Walk away if needed. Maybe put one very small drop in to \u201ctest the waters.\u201d Soothe her. Cry with her. But don\u2019t scream at her.", "Yeah YTA\n\nit probably hurts or is still uncomfortable. Your kid is 10. Learn some anger management techniques and don't take out your frustration on your kid.", "YTA yelling at and insulting a sick child who you want to trust you is not the way to do this.", "YTA and you shouldn\u2019t microwave them either.  Can you get tablet antibiotics instead of drops??  My kid had a double ear infection and was prescribed tablets instead of drops.", "Yeah, YTA. She's a 10 year old who's scared. You're the adult and parent. You're stressed and worried so you're snapping at her, I get it. You're human and it happens. But I think you owe her an apology. You don't want your kid walking on eggshells around you or being afraid her emotions might trigger negative ones in you. And it means so much for the kid to know that when their parents mess up, they're willing to communicate and work through it with them. \n\nAs for how to actually administer, I have no idea. But I'd suggest maybe posting in a subreddit for parents or calling your pediatrician. Maybe also ask your daughter what scares her and see if you can problem solve together to make it less scary for her?", "YTA she\u2019s a kid who is sick and in pain. Obviously she is gonna be upset when your making her more uncomfortable even if it\u2019s for her benefit. Calling her names isn\u2019t going to make the process any easier.", "Yta grow up she's 10 years old. Why don't you STOP bullying your sick child", "YTA\n\nWhen I was a kid, I had really bad asthma to the point my mom had to come into my classes and give me nebulizer treatments. I was embarrassed and uncomfortable and those treatments took what felt like FOREVER. Instead of yelling at me, my mom sat me down and told me that she understood what I was feeling, but these were necessary for me to get better so I could live in a healthy way my life and eventually she'd hopefully be able to stop coming. She didn't yell at me. She didn't belittle me. \n\nYou chose poorly.", "YTA, when I last had an ear infection putting ear drops in hurt so much I almost cried and I'm an adult. She's a child and in pain, yelling at her isn't going to make it better.\nI'm also not sure if it is a good idea to microwave the ear drops.", "YTA. It's not nice/good to name call anyone, much less your daughter. It's destructive to self-worth. Maybe look online for some creative ideas to motivate her to put up with the drops. Does she go swimming, play in sprinklers? Sometimes just educating someone into seeing it's not scary helps.", "YTA - you do not microwave ear drops!  it loses its effect.  if u want to warm it up then run it under warm water tap or warmed up cloth.  plus u shamed her and called her a baby for which she apologized and told u she was scared.  \n\ncall her pediatrician / family doctor if u want advice on how to manage expectations or advice on this.", "YTA - she is a CHILD. Of course she\u2019s going to act like \u201ca baby\u201d. Read a parenting book PLEASE. \nAlso - DO NOT microwave antibiotics, that is not safe for your child\u2019s infection and is just going to make their infection worse. I\u2019m sorry but that is absolutely mind blowing that a full almost 40 year old adult would think that\u2019s okay.", "YTA\n\nYou're certainly an asshole for yelling \"just stop being a baby and take the ear drops\" at a 10 year old.\n\n>  she started crying and said she was sorry but was so scared.\n\nWhat is she afraid of?", "YTA your poor YOUNG daughter is sick, in pain, and scared. Instead of having patience and waiting for her to calm down you insulted and belittled her. \n\nAlso why the hell are you microwaving medicine?!?! You may have rendered it useless. Ask the pediatrician to make sure the meds are still effective or else you\u2019ve scarred your daughter for literally no reason.", "She's freaking 10 and she was acting like a baby.\n\nNo, NTA.\n\nYou're allowed to get frustrated with irritating, irrational behaviour even if it's a child doing it, OP. You're human too.", "YTA. Absolutely, you were in the wrong, even though your frustration is understandable.\n\nThis is a golden opportunity to show your daughter how to apologize when we lose our shit.", "YTA. She'll remember being sick and scared and you getting angry at her when she needed comfort.", "Ear drops really hurt. Poor kid", "YTA. You yelled at your kid when she was vulnerable and scared. Yeah she was being annoying as hell, but she is 1. sick, 2. ten years old, and 3. your daughter. Not your best parenting moment. I would suggest you apologize (getting a real apology from your parent means a lot as a kid, even regarding minor stuff like this, speaking as someone who never really got any until they were an adult) and next time remove yourself from the situation before you snap at her. No one's perfect, man.", "Yeah, YTA. I understand your frustration, really I do! But losing your temper and calling her a baby isn\u2019t the way. This is something that will unfortunately stay with her, and I think you should sit her down and apologize. Explain that parents make mistakes sometimes too and say things they don\u2019t mean, and that you\u2019ll try to do better from now on.\n\nWhen I was young, like 4 or 5, I had to take some sort of liquid medicine. The taste was awful and I couldn\u2019t stand that type of medicine so I refused to take it. After my parents tried unsuccessfully to give it to me for awhile, my dad, in his frustration, flung one of our kitchen chairs and cracked one of our cabinet doors. Needless to say, I took the medicine. But it also made me grow up afraid. To be frank, I\u2019d rather deal with the sickness than the shame and fear of that memory.\n\nIt sounds like you started out with everything right. Trying to get her calm, having her favorite show on, warming the drops (EDIT: Though I would double check that these are the types of drops that can be warmed). I think when she started fussing, it might have been good to pause everything and talk her through her feelings, about what specifically she was afraid of and how the ear drops will make her feel better. Being honest that yeah, it might feel uncomfortable for a little while and it\u2019s normal to be scared of new things. But that you\u2019ll be with her every step of the way and that you only want her to feel better. Let her talk herself through her own emotions too, sometimes just having the space to verbalize our fears makes them less scary. Good luck to both of you in this hard time. <3", "YTA in regards to yelling at her in frustration and telling her to stop being a baby. I understand that, as a whole, we humans can lose our patience when we are trying to help someone who NEEDS to do something for their health but doesn't WANT to do said thing. Even more so when it isn't communicated what is making them feel apprehensive or afraid of it (I have been known to be on both ends of this scale and am always actively trying to be better). (You're N T A in regards to trying to help your sick kid get better, despite her aversion to the eardrops).\n\nHOWEVER, as someone who grew up having chronic ear infections that followed me into adulthood, maybe I can offer some help/wisdom! \n\nI don't know if you've ever needed to have drops in your ears, but I can tell you it's the absolute WORST if the drops go straight into the ear canal right off the bat. When she is laying on her side you can see there's a little \"bowl\" that is created just inside the ear next to the ear canal. If you place the drops there, 1) she will have better control of the temp of the drops (if too hot/too cold), 2) SHE can be the one controlling the movement and guiding the fluid into the ear, making it much less shocking and unpleasant, and 3) it might lead into a conversation of how important it is to communicate what is wrong so action can be taken to prevent these obstacles in the future.\n\nEar infections are no fun and having to place drops, even more so. I sincerely hope this makes sense and helps make the experience significantly better! I'm sending ALL of the healing thoughts to your kiddo \ud83d\udc96 \n\n(Also, WONDERFUL job on setting up her surroundings to be as comfortable as possible! MAJOR mom points right there)\n\nEdit: I forgot to say the drops can be heated in a hand or an armpit to warm it up, please don't stove or microwave it!", "1. 10 *is* a baby.\n2. Sh#t on your ear drum hurts like hell. Like I had a whole Rx for a controlled substance after a DROP of blood dried on my ear drum.\n3. Why would she lie? Would it hurt to acknowledge that it's painful to HER?\n\nYTA.", "YTA, JUST DO IT!! Ear infections can possibly lead to her being deaf.", "NAH. The core of your message is correct: she needs to take the medicine, that's she  will get better.", "NAH. This is a frustrating situation where you're trying to help care for someone who's actively fighting back against it. I'm sorry that you snapped, and I do hope you apologise to your daughter for screaming.\n\nPerhaps you could call the doctor and ask if it's harmful to take the eardrops when you don't need them? If it isn't harmful, you could help your daughter by showing they aren't that bad by taking one in your ear first, and showing how it's no biggie.", "I guess NAH. \n\nThis sounds incredibly frustrating, and TBH, sometimes kids need a bit of tough love.  She can't help being irrationally scared, but at some point, for her own benefit, she will have to get over it.  And it sounds like this went on repeatedly.  \n\nI have no advice.  This isn't something you can reason your way through.  She will have to deal with it.  Logically, by 10 she should understand that whatever reason she has the drops needs to be dealt with and this is the response.  Realistically, that won't work.", "NTA.

I hope you get to read this because even though it was kind of an AH thing to do, *I totally get it.* I had a similar experience with my daughter and eye drops and OMG it's so frustrating! \ud83d\ude24 \n\nI don't know if this will help you, but it helped me: think of her as a puppy. Like an honest-to-goodness 70lb puppy who needs ear drops. She doesn't get it; she's scared; you are the only one who can help. Talking softly, help her understand her feelings and what it is shes actually afraid of. Don't let her lead (think, \"in 5 minutes, we're doing this, and no more TV until it's done.\" instead of asking when she's ready) and don't expect her to like it. Also, **treats!** The \"token economy\" is a vastly underrated parenting resource! (And it's only bribing if it's unplanned \ud83d\ude09)\n\nApologize for losing your temper, then have a chat about it. Agree on a prize when she gets them without fussing. And good luck! It won't last forever.", "You are not.  Warm water bath maybe would be better.  Or asking for a tablet.  My kid got a tablets for their double ear infection.", "Yeh thinking the same, I've never seen \"microwave\" on a script. I'd imagine this makes it useless or diminishes the effect.", "Just googled, a simple Google search shows this destroys the efficacy, so it probably is unbearably painful as it's gotten worse since prior doses may as well have been orange juice for all it matters", "One of my first thoughts too. She could have burned the inside of her kids ear if the kid didn't freak out.", "Yea you shouldn\u2019t", "Also, don't microwave medication! You could get it too hot and it makes it less effective. Put the bottle under your armpit or in your bra for a few minutes until it reaches body temperature.\n\nEdit-I'd contact the doctor and tell them what you did to the medicine, see if you need to get a new bottle. \n\nMy daughter had to have ear drops not long ago, she's 9, she got so scared when I warned that the bottle said it might hurt for a second before it made her ear ache stop. I held her and assured her it would be okay and told her we had to do this even if it was scary. She cried so hard she made her nose bleed but the second the drops hit her ear and it didn't hurt, she was fine. Just a little more crying from leftover stress and she was okay. \n\nIt sucks as a parent to not be able to calm your child, but if something is medically necessary, the best you can do is be calm and comforting while you do what has to be done.", "Letting her give them to herself is a good idea - gives her a sense of control.", "The conversation and hug didn't help my daughter much. She still cried her eyes out in fear that the ear drops would hurt (it said on the bottle it might hurt for a moment before it took the ear ache away, I warned her because I didn't want her to freak out if it happened, and I don't regret being honest even though it scared her) until she made her nose bleed. \n\nI just held her head gently in my lap and talked to her softly while she cried and put the drops in, assuring her that even though it was scary, we had to do it and everything would be okay soon. \n\nThe drops didn't end up hurting, her ear ache disappeared instantly, I hugged her while she finished crying from the stress, and everything was fine. She had her medicine, her feelings were validated, and I didn't get frustrated. \n\nMy kids know that their body their choice is a rule I'll abide by for everything except health issues. Teeth brushing, baths, general hygiene, medication, diet injuries, etc are situations where what I say goes until they're grown ups. I'll give them as much choice as I can (what kind of hygiene products, liquid/tablet/pill medication, preferred veggies and fruit, what kind of bandage) but at the end of the day, I'm the person in charge of making sure they have a healthy body until they're old enough to be in charge of it.", "NAH\n\nSure, yelling to a kid because she is scared is not the good way. But OP is a patent that most probably is worry, very tired and hasn't sleep well due to the sick kid, so having little patience is understandable.\n\nOPs as someone else suggested, take the opportunity to apologize and talk to your kid on how to manage the emotions both of your are feeling", "I know i need to give them to her and not doing so was not okay, and I'm giving them to her tonight one way or another.", "I think shes scared of the ear drops going into her ear.", "I would never have thought that a few ear drops would hurt - is it just unfamiliarity with the sensation and feeling sensitive, or is it the medicine interacting with the infected area? Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever had this so genuine question", "Thank you I will apologize to her.", "You are right, she is a baby and I forgot about that in a moment of frustration. \n\nIm so sorry you had to go through that, I hope so much that it isnt that bad for her.", "I'm gonna do it one way or another.", "Kids aren\u2019t always rational.  Especially when they are in pain and scared.  An adult should know better than to call a scared child a baby.", "Because I'm sure you listened ALL the time as a kid.", "Kids need to learn, which is why we need to *teach.* Yelling and name-calling are not effective teaching tools.", "Thank you I appreciate the sympathy.\n\n I know calling her a baby was hurtful and I shouldn't have done it, but I was really frustrated.

Like something tickles the inside of your ear. Eww.", "Op is basically add \"water\" tp that baby's ears. Poor kid, ear infections suck and her OP parent is YTA", "Have had ear drops, they don't hurt. There's no nasty taste because you dont injest it, you drop them in the ear. They aren't acid, so they don't burn. I suspect you are talking about them touching the inflamed area, but that would be why I wouldn't warm them up, I'd keep them cool, because it would feel like relief.\n\nI am really not sure why OP is using the microwave to warm it, I suspect their kid is being burnt by the drops being too hot... especially since they ask for the drops to cool down", "As a parent who had to coax a 4 year old to take antibiotics (liquid for 10 days) she was an AH.  \n\nDid I get frustrated??  Damn straight.  Were there times I cried my eyes out because I was so frustrated??  Yes.  Did I ever yell at my child and call them a baby?? Never\n\nIt took a few days but we figured out a routine that worked.  I never took my frustrations out on my child.  She was sick, scared and in pain.  It was a new experience for her.\n\nThankfully she\u2019s older now and takes tablets.", "The difference is OP is the parent. She can be impatient, but yelling at your kid for being scared and calling them a baby is an AH move. No matter what her mental state is.", "If she's so scared, she should probably stop destroying her daughter's medication in the microwave so she might actually get better.", "You need to go get the prescription refilled so the medicine is effective. Microwaving it ruined the one you had. \n\nYTA.", "Call and see if you can be prescribed a tablet version vs ear drops.", "Maybe don\u2019t microwave them? \n\nThere\u2019s probably no point giving them now you\u2019ve blasted them in a microwave. Were you dropped on the head as a child?", "I mean you already damaged the ear drops by microwaving them so you need new ones", "I'm speaking to you as an adult who has hearing loss because of an earache that was treated incorrectly as a child. \n\nThe pain that I would get from earaches was so much worse than anything else that I had experienced in my childhood. While my medication didn't scare me, I can absolutely understand why it might scare someone - the throbbing is so bad that you don't want anything near it. \n\nI know that it is difficult but please be calm for her. It is stressful when you are scared and feeling guilty because you are stressing a parent only makes it worse. \n\nPlease call the doctor and find out if the medication is still good once it has been microwaved. \n\nPlease, ask them for other techniques that may help your daughter to take the medicine properly. \n\nBuy the new medicine/peanut butter cups/prizes or whatever you need to do to help her to get better.

It was painful as hell.  And the drops are uncomfortable and can make weird noises or accentuate the filling of fullness or blockage.", "I fucking HATE the sensation of ear and eye drops. I\u2019m 26 and I\u2019ll do everything I can to avoid them. They\u2019re deeply uncomfortable for me and when you have infections I can imagine they\u2019ll hurt.", "Ear infections usually hurt. Bad. I got one last month. I knew that it would stop any minute because I just had to wait for my eardrum to open to relieve the pressure, and I still took the strongest painkillers I had on hand (and then my eardrum popped before the painkillers kicked in, that popping sound was both the best and grossest sound I\u2019d heard in a long time; but the goo coming out of my ear was just gross). \n\nAlso, the feeling of something wet like ear drops in your ear is just gross anyway, even without the ear already hurting.

You love them, but it\u2019s basically her job as a kid to take your last frayed nerve and poke at it until you break. She\u2019ll forgive you. Adults lose their cool sometimes.

Like I don\u2019t want to be a dick OP but you\u2019re nearly 40 and you think microwaving ear drops is a good idea? There\u2019s so much wrong with that. \n\nI\u2019m genuinely struggling to understand the thought process here. Also screaming at children is never good. I totally have sympathy for people who get to the end of their tether now and again. Most of us who have kids have been guilty of raising our voices a little too much over something pretty silly. \n\nBut losing your shit and screaming after 5 mins because of medicine seems like a massive overreaction.", "Get her new meds first.
