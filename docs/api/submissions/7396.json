And I felt that it was okay to say no because I still made sure to tell her that I care about her regardless.\n\nMy daughter rang me the next day saying that DIL was upset about it and felt rejected and my son said that I was callous for not wanting to let her call me mom.

Your love for your DIL is apparent and you were respectful in how you communicated your feelings. You are entitled to choose how you are referred to by anyone, and have a right to boundaries. It could very well be that, as you already have your daughter who is your child, you may also worry that she may feel replaced as a daughter if you equate your DIL to her, so you might also want to be securing your own daughter's feelings in this.\n\nA good compromise could be to allow her to call you something different to what your daughter calls you, but also has the same meaning.

You are entitled to your boundaries of course, I\u2019m just confused by them. Can you imagine how much courage it took for her to ask you that? She\u2019s probably thought of you and wanted to call you mom for years and you shut her down.

I call my MIL \u201cmam\u201d and my mother \u201cmum\u201d and I know of many similar, it is quite common.", "\"I have never heard of that being done before, at least where we are (meaning that this isn't a cultural tradition that I'm denying her). And I felt that it was okay to say no\"\n\nIt's very understandable that you're uncomfortable! It's a weird thing that is very common, but also partially had fallen out of favor, and many people don't even know is a thing.\n\nIt *is* a very very common tradition in the USA, and usually the DIL who decides, as some bad MILs will try to insist on being called \"mom\".\n\n100% her feeling rejected is understandable. This is a very common request from SILs/DILs, and I've never heard of it being refused before.\n\nIt's a sign of trust, relationship, and respect, and doesn't in any way mean she's confused about parentage.\n\nYou *are* her mother-in-law.\nYou *are* her mom-in-law.\nYou *are* her \"mom\" (in-law).\nYou're not her birth mother, but you *are* her mother in the family she married in to. Mom is the proper term. It's a different kind of mom, but still the proper term.\n\nYou are literally her mother, through marriage. Not her only mother, but her second one, through marriage. Again, this is not the same kind of mom as raising a kid, it doesn't make you her parent, and that's not what she's asking.\n\nShe's asking to use the proper cultural term of respect towards you that indicates familiarity and respect and trust.\n\nSon in laws can and do call MIL \"mom\" and FIL \"dad\", and DIL call FIL \"dad\" too. It's usually the DIL/SIL who individually decides for themselves, for each parent independently, whether to call their in-laws, but the in-laws usually give a prompting of their preference (\"Mr Lastname\", \"Mr Firstname\", \"Firstname\", \"Dad\").\n\nIt's understandable if you feel uncomfortable or awkward. And you have the right to say no. It'll just slightly harm that relationship which you yourself said is a good one, but that's your choice, and she is a big girl and can get over it.\n\nIf you want to fix the situation relationally, just be honest and tell her it makes you feel uncomfortable, as you aren't familiar with people making that request, but because she means so much to you, you'll embrace it.\n\nYou'll get used to it, and it's not like it'll be used twenty times a day. Just view it as an honorific, because that's genuinely what it is.\n\nOr tell her that you love her, but you can't get comfortable with the label, and it's not because you're rejecting her, it just is not something people do in your personal cultural background. And maybe buy her a small gift to show you care, and tell her glad you are that she's in your family.\n\n(it'd be *far* easier to just put up with it though. What's it cost you?)\n\nAnd yea, it's very common. It even goes back to ancient roman times, where powerful families would sometimes even legally adopt a son-in-law as a full son.\n\nPeople not doing it is even more common, though. Usually it's the DIL who decides.\n\nIf you want a good laugh, here's comedian Jim Gaffigan calling people like your daughter-in-law a weirdo:\nhttps://youtu.be/y5UgiQcDnbE", "YTA.

You're not an asshole, but you still hurt her feelings. So she's not an AH for being upset either.", "NTA. I would never feel comfortable calling an inlaw mom/dad or being called that by an inlaw.

That is really rare. Maybe as a compromise find a special term or nickname that she can use for you.", "NAH\n\nBut you are the unsympathetic one.  I\u2019m going to assume that you had relatively decent parents, and didn\u2019t have to go out of your way to find someone who would love you and treat you like a mom should, because your own mom was crap. Then when you finally do, and you get the courage to tell this unrelated person that you think of them as mom and would like to express that, you get rejected from that idea. Even if you\u2019re not rejected from the love, it still feels like rejection.\n\nI absolutely support you saying no. I don\u2019t understand it - it doesn\u2019t require anything different if you for her to call you mom. But that\u2019s irrelevant; you get to set those boundaries.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to set boundaries that could hurt someone you do t intend to hurt, though, you need to BOTH communicate far better about it being a \u201cyou\u201d issue and very foreign to your culture and so on AND realize that you are going to cause hurt to someone you love. \n\nSetting boundaries that hurt others isn\u2019t wrong. It can hurt my kids feelings when I say they can\u2019t show their love by snuggling me wresting-style once they\u2019re old enough to feel like they\u2019ll perforate my stomach with their pointy elbows. It hurts because it\u2019s an unmet expectation tied up in love. But it\u2019s still important to set the boundaries for safety (physical or emotional or mental). Which is why it becomes important to set the boundaries with love and care and understanding of what is underlying these requests/demands/attack-hugs, and speaking to that directly, validating her feelings, and seeing if there is a mutually agreeable solution to the desire she was presenting.\n\nA good conversation would have included things like \u201cI love that you see me as a mother figure to you\u201d and \u201cI do see you as like my own daughter\u201d (which you may well have done) and \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with someone I didn\u2019t give birth to calling me mom; it\u2019s just not something I was ever raised around\u201d (again, might have been said) AND \u201cbut I understand it\u2019s important to you to express this connection. Is there another way we can find that will work for both of us? What about Bonus Mom?\u201d \n\nThe answer might have been no - maybe there was nothing that would work both of you to express this sentiment of hers. Maybe it\u2019s the sentiment itself - the idea that you had a part in raising her, parenting her, and being what a mom is from a much younger age - is not entirely comfortable to you. That\u2019s ok too.\n\nBut the conversation is where you put into action your love for her.\n\nNAH, OP.\n\nThis is hard stuff, and I hope you both get the space and grace and support to find an even better relationship moving forward, because it sounds like you both are good people who deserve the support working through the hard things.", "NTA, but I know quite a few people with bad home lifes who choose to call someone who isn\u2019t blood related their family, mom, dad, brother, sister, etc. I would strongly suggest you reconsider opening up to her in this way but it\u2019s your choice to set whatever boundaries you feel comfortable with.", "I guess you're just not a person who understands famial bonds with those who aren't blood.

At the same time I can see why that might make you feel uncomfortable. I agree with another commenter, it might be nice if you could let her have some form of special endearment for you - \u201caunt\u201d or something - she just wants to honour what you are to her, and I\u2019d hate for this to sour that at all.", "NAH, you can be uncomfortable and she can be hurt.\n\nBut to me it is very normal for people to call their MIL 'mom'-- in my experience it is a 50/50 split between using their first name or saying 'mom/dad'", "NAH", "NAH it\u2019s a real thing that people do and she\u2019s allowed to feel rejected.

Her not so great home life growing up might mean you are her main mother figure. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that my kids\u2019 friends without a great home life call me Mom.
