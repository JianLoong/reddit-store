AIirlines in the USA seem absolutely terrible.", "NTA and what airline is this? You were right and they were wrong and just how did they get to be such wankers?", "NTA, but yea you can't swear at them or even act upset, too many people have gone nuts now so they are over the top with that policy. I can't help but wonder if this was a micro or macro aggression on their part to force you to move for this other couple.", "It sucks but on a plane the flight attendants are God. What they say goes period. As you found disagreeing with them gets you kicked off a plane. Even if they are being unfair. Which they clearly were. Sometimes you can very politely see if you can get what you need. But it takes deference and infinite politeness. If they sense any hostility or even the slightest aggression it\u2019s over. \u201cMa\u2019am I will absolutely comply with your directions  however I have concerns about physically fitting in the middle seat. Are there any other alternatives?\u201d  If they say no you squish yourself in or request to be put on a later flight. \n\nYou know now and will be prepared for next time. You can ask for a partial refund after the flight due to not getting the seat you paid for.\n\nFlying is awful because you basically give up your rights to get somewhere faster.", "NTA. Being 6'2\" I also always book the aisle, I also get a bit claustrophobic sitting in the middle as I have pretty broad shoulders as well. If I went through the effort and expense of booking an aisle seat and then had this crap pulled on me I would be absolutely furious, especially if my travel plans were disrupted.", "NTA. But it is what it is, unfortunately. Discussing with these people is totally pointless.", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't the asshole for being angry; who wouldn't? Airlines are jerks.  I'm betting that the couple were Double Triple Gold Star With Platinum Sparkles with the airline, or something like that. \n\nHere's where you were foolish: you assumed that a sit-down strike would get you what you want.  It won't.  I don't know if you saw the footage last year of a doctor being dragged off the plane because of a seat mixup.  It happened.  He got a concussion.\n\nAnnouncing that you wanted the seat didn't get your seat.  You were rightly angry.   You were told what the solution was: you could go rebook.  At that point you knew that the flight attendant wasn't going to give in, so you might as well have followed their orders.   By cursing (and probably raising your voice), you got tossed off the plane.\n\nHere's the thing.  Being assertive with an airline *does not work*.   Some kinds of customer service you can get by being loud enough and firm enough (although being firm enough and polite enough works much better).  Airplane seats are not one of them.  When you're on the plane, the attendants are in charge, and you aren't.\n\nSo.  You're (gently) the asshole for not giving up when you saw you wouldn't get what you want.  At a certain point, you have to let the Wookiee win.   American airlines suck, they're overbooked, they are opaque about the reservations, and everybody's tired and cranky.  Nonetheless, you should save the complaints for the airline, not for the people on the plane with you.  There is a time to stick to your principles to your last breath, and getting your seat changed is not one of them.", "NTA but\u2026you forgot swearing will get you booted from flights.

There is no scenario in which changing an extra legroom seat you paid for is acceptable. And the way they over dramatise someone swearing - if they don\u2019t want to hear it, they should treat customers better. \n\nPut a complaint in, not only to the airline but to the aviation authority of whatever country you live in. I would also dispute the charge on your credit card - you paid for a direct flight and got a different product - if you paid for a Mercedes and they sent a Toyota, you wouldn\u2019t pay.", "Technically she was correct. There was nothing they could do for you but seat you. The people at the desk were the only ones that could get you what you wanted .", "ESH. Sounds like you're downplaying your actual reaction, but the airline changing your seat without warning was also lame.", "NEVER give cabin crew reason to throw you off a flight by being aggressive, combative or using foul language.  The easiest route for them in a situation like this is to find an excuse to deny boarding so the airline can avoid paying you compensation.  You sound like you've flown a bit so you should know this.  Yes, it's a fucked up situation.  And yes, YTA.\n\nIn the future, be firm but polite.  Explain why you have to have this seat and the proffered one is unacceptable.  Ask for the senior or the purser.  Explain again to him or her.  You may ultimately wind up having to choose between the seat you don't want or getting off the plane (which means you will not be on that flight -- the gate agent will usually be unable to fix it if the flight is truly full).  At least, however, you'll get some compensation, though rarely sufficient to make up for the inconvenience of having to take a later flight.", "I always print my tickets now!! Even if I have the digital, I\u2019ve had too many seats or flights switched on me. Might have been different with printed proof.", "YTA but only because you reserved an Aisle seat thinking you would be able to use the actual aisle for extra leg room and you didn't book a seat with specific extra leg room, like an Exit Row or Plus seat that actually DOES give you more leg room. \n\nThen you argued about it. \n\nYour seat got changed like for like space, except it was a middle seat and not an aisle seat. Same leg room IF you properly kept your legs inside the seating area. \n\nIf you are tall, ALWAYS try to get the Exist Row seat.  Usually there are only 2 seats in the row and there is ALWAYS extra space because in the event of an emergency, the person in that row has to handle pulling in the door and moving it out of the way, so there is extra space to do that. \n\nAirlines are a pain in the ass and they WILL nickel and dime every flyer to get as much out of us as they can for the least amount of effort.  Unfortunately, since flying is a privilege, we have to play their game. \n\nUnfortunately, that means if you want the extra space, you are going to have to pay for it, and not just hope you can cheap out and not have an issue, like you ended up having this time. \n\nDO NOT FIGHT with the flight crew.  Their job is to keep everyone alive from point A to point B, and they are, literally, the gods of the sky.   If you piss them off, you will get thrown off the plane, even if you paid premium for the flight, if you fight too much, they will have you arrested. \n\nIt sucks, flying is a pain in the ass, but honestly, this is not a hill you want to die on.", "What is a corridor seat", "How does an aisle seat give you more leg room? Are you sticking your legs in the aisle? I'm going with ~~Y T A~~ on that assumption for now... Edited, not precisely the asshole but come on, we all gotta lick a little boot when it comes to air travel. OP couldn't hang.", "NTA. Stuff like this is why I prefer to drive 9 hours to visit family instead of dealing with airlines. It used to be okay when there were direct flights, but Continental merged and United did away with them. I'd rather deal with 9 hours or more in a car than subject myself to four or five hours deal with connecting flights and the annoyance of flying.", "OP did not check the boarding pass to know that seat got updated by the airline and then created drama on flight. Sounds  like YTA.", "INFO:\n\nWas the seat advertised as extra legroom, and you paid for that? i.e. it was a different category of seat? Or did you just pay to choose a seat - like how you have to pay anytime you want to choose a specific seat - and picked a (regular economy) aisle seat?\n\nAFAIK they can move you around within the same category with impunity, but if they move you to a worse category of seat - like from business to economy - you can file a complaint and get the staff who made that call into serious trouble. That's not supposed to happen.", "That motherfucker back there is not real. So no you're not the asshole.", "NTA airlines suck and pretty much every flight attendant I\u2019ve met is an asshole", "That\u2019s how it works, you need to be compliant when you\u2019re stuck in a tube with 250 people or you get removed. The other travellers would\u2019ve felt unsafe if you were swearing at the staff. You should\u2019ve complied and taken it up with the airline later. If you want legroom you pay business class or sit over the emergency exit. It\u2019s annoying for sure but not the place to start a debate.", "NTA\n\nNever curse.  That was your only mistake.\n\nYou booked your seat and it's your seat.  If they had asked you to switch seats, it's one thing.  But you swiped in with your app as you cleared the gate so your seat was reserved.\n\nThere is of course the chance that they changed your seat while you were at the gate. You would have seen this on the Delta app.  This is why I don't use the built in wallet.  You get a lot more information including if the gate changes or there is a delay.  \n\nGo to Delta and ask for a manager.  Talk to them calmly and nicely and explain to them the situation.

Why is it in just this industry you can sell more tickets than you have seats, and also deny people the accommodations/service they paid for?

So what would be the grounds to move it to federal court?", "Any attorney that attempted to petition for a trial transfer to a federal court from a small claims court in which damages sought are <$100 (which is likely due to most \"choose your own seat\" fees range from the $7-$70 range) would be laughed out of court.", "They're miserable and jealous and try to rip people down to their level, I feel sorry for them", "Maybe look at the context of the deadname being mentioned because of her wish to be disassociated with her father and their shared last name because he refuses to recognize her gender.  History and context are important. If we erase all the unpleasant bits, we are editing and losing the message", "So, definitively not gated behind the ticket and as likely to read as an EULA even if it was shoved in your face.", "I mean, that\u2019s where everyone else\u2019s T\u2019s & C\u2019s are too\u2026", "Yep, all there enough to regulate my emotions enough to avoid language that gets me kicked off a plane in fact.", "Amtrak doesn't require people to prove who they are to ride the train. No pseudo-pretend-government agency is clearing them before departure so people who can't fly and don't want to drive/bus will hop on a train. There's also people who have really bad flying anxiety and fears. But honestly, I think that most of the train rides for longer distances are rail tourists wanting to \"see America\". There's a ton of train enthusiast youtubers who ride the rails around and post videos of the whole thing. To get a sleeper car kind of set up with your own room and bathroom, you can easily spend thousands of dollars on it. It's crazy and it's only sometimes as nice as you'd expect it to be. Trains in other places like Japan and Europe though, they are dope.", "Wait, you\u2019re telling me that incidents increased dramatically between 2020 and 2021/22? I am utterly shocked at this revelation. What could have possibly been the cause for this?", "This is what happens when you push people past the limit of how much they allow themselves to be violated and exploited?? No shit people are pissed every time they have to experience anything involved with airline companies. They crossed the line years ago and people are finally snapping.", "I worked for two airlines and they did not just get carte blanche to shaft customers. And it\u2019s pretty naive to assume that companies only do things out of necessity."]}
