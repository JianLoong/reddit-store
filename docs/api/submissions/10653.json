Sometimes you have to keep family members on a low info diet.", "NTA\n\nI was 45 when I got my ADHD diagnosis and my mother was both dismissive and took it as a personal attack on her parenting. And how can I be depressed, I have a lovely life and I\u2019m *so funny!* I don\u2019t share anything about my progress with her anymore. I know where I can go for support and she isn\u2019t a part of that.", "NTA. I have gone through a very similar situation with my parents and my recent adulthood ADHD (28M) diagnosis. I feel in my case my parents are partly trying to avoid blaming themselves for not picking up on it when I was growing up, but that is not an excuse. In the case of your mom, she still needs to atleast accept that what you are going through is real, and ask if you are doing better since your diagnosis. If she is not supportive of a real medical diagnosis, then you have every right to not want to discuss these things with her. If she is not a trained mental health professional, she has no right to contradict one, especially if she doesn't think they are real", "NTA. \n\nI would be tempted to message grandma and suggest that if she thinks you had no reason to be so curt with mom, maybe grandma didn't hear the whole story. If she actually asks for your side of the story, that's a good sign, but I would politely decline saying that it is really between you and your mom and you don't want to risk doing what she did and giving a biased opinion.\n\nBottom line, do what you know you need to do for your own wellbeing. Mom is looking to reinforce her own views, not looking to help you here unfortunately.", "NTA. You do not owe her an apology, or anything else. If it were me, I would go low contact, if not no contact. \n\nIf anyone is being dismissive, it's her. Sounds like she has been your entire life", "NTA\n\nI hate people like this, my ex in laws also do not believe in ADHD, ASD, Bipolar, etc...\n\nYour mom sounds like  right \\*\\*\\*\\* for implying those with disorders are not intelligent or \"normal\"", "NO you should not apologize.  Just because she doesn't believe in something doesn't change actual FACTS.  You are NTA and she's rude", "Speaking as someone with ADHD & OCD and was diagnosed as a kid I'm sorry your mom acted this way. My parents were very supportive and worked with school to make learning for me as easy as possible when they noticed me struggling. I'm sorry your mom couldn't do that for you and I think it would be best to just go no contact with her if she is that adamant that mental differences aren't a thing. How would she treat any kids you might have if they end up with brains a little different? I'd guess she'd be adamant that it was you putting those ideas in their head and they were actually normal. As for your grandma if she knows about how your mom is and what she said to you after getting an actual diagnosis from a doctor I would lower contact with her as well. You don't owe your mom an apology. She owes you one.", "NTA - she knows more than the doctors?  She's TAH here. You don't owe her an apology, she interrupted YOU based on what I picked up there.", "Let's start with your 46 year old mother complaining to your grandmother when your conversation didn't go the way she wanted it to.  That's called triangulation.  *You won't do what I want, so I'll get someone else to maneuver you into giving me my way.*  Aside from the fact that she chose not to \"believe\" in ADHD and punished you for exhibiting classic signs of the condition in an era when we all **know it's a thing**, her inability to even listen to what you (an adult) have to say, is a sign that she's toxic.  I don't say that readily, but your mother is not interested in having a healthy adult relationship with you.  You told her how that made you feel.  She didn't like it and went running to mommy.  How bizarre.  NTA", "...and you can tell your grandmother to fuck off as well.\n\nAt least you know where your mum got her shitty attitude from. Good job she didn't pass this miserable, demeaning and patronising trait on to you.\n\nNTA and do not apologise.", "NTA\n\nUgh I had the same exact argument with my parents when I got diagnosed 2 years ago! When my therapist and I discussed it I felt such a sense of relief bc all of my shortcomings and patterns of behavior made sense. It made me realize why none of the \u2018just make a list\u2019 or \u2018you can make a habit in 28 days\u2019 advice ever worked for me. I had dinner with my parents soon after and casually mentioned it to them expecting some sort of similar realization as me. \n\nThey said \u2018no you don\u2019t. We would know. We have dealt with *those* kind of kids and you weren\u2019t one. You made good grades in school.\u2019 I rattled off a list of examples of emotional meltdowns, forgetfulness, performance anxiety, forgotten hobbies, etc from my childhood and they still denied it. I ended the conversation by saying \u2018well two different doctors disagree with you so let me know when you finish med school\u2019", "NTA. \nAs I was reading this I assumed she was boomer or older age (60s-70\u2019s) but then went back and saw she was closer to me?! Well, still not cool for her to not have an open mind and just think she knows best because she\u2019s your mom. As someone closer to her age I can say there were misconceptions about a neurodiverse diagnosis\u2019s when we were younger, it\u2019s sad she\u2019s carried it to adulthood. I don\u2019t think you need to apologize but maybe have a conversation in person. If she is still in denial that\u2019s on her.", "YTA\n\nIf you tell her you're not telling her things anymore.  ***Just DO IT!***  \n\nYou are an adult with a spouse.
