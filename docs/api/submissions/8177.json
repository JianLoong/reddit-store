You should be permitted to use sick leave for bereavement. However, if you have already used up all of your paid sick leave they are under no obligation to pay you for additional paid sick days. The appropriate thing for them to do would be to allow you to take unpaid time off.

My husband has a business and I've been a senior partner at my firm awhile, we have dealt with this situation a few times. If an immediate family member dies (mum, dad, child, spouse, grandparent) and a person has no paid leave left we usually try and work something out but for a cousin I would probably just tell them I'm sorry for their loss but will only be able to approve unpaid leave if they have no paid leave left.
