Unlimited sick days, the first five or six weeks (not entirely sure) with full pay, then the insurance covers like 70-80% (again, not entirely sure). You can't get fired at all if you're pregnant and parental leave is like 1-2 years (different models exist here with how the parents can split up this time between them). If your doctor says your job is too demanding during your pregnancy, you are exempt from working but you still get your paycheck. And your employer is obligated to offer you your original job once you return from patental leave. \nYou get bereavement holidays and you get a day if you move to a new place to live. Then there's holidays for educational purposes and of course for a wedding. \nAnd that's actually the bare minimum by law. Lots of employers offer more benefits. Like my employer for example has a company daycare for employee's kids and subsidized meals. At the company my father works for, employee's can decide once a year if they'd rather have a raise or an additional week of paid vacation. \n\nI mean, even here there's lots of things that need improving but if an employer tried to offer conditions like they are common in North America, people would riot. And we historically only riot if the beer prices increase too much (not kidding here)."]}
