Generally people asking about job contracts are either executives or from Europe, where contracts for jobs are normal. \n\nThe closest thing to a contract most US employees have is signing a statement that they received their employee handbook after they\u2019re hired, and agree to abide by the company\u2019s policies as spelled out in it.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason we have a separate category of contract workers, because that\u2019s not our norm.", "We get decent PTO, but it is just that, PTO. It\u2019s not one pot of sick leave and one pot something else.", "It often gets co-mingled as \"Paid time off\" e.g. Massachusetts passed an 'earned sick time' scheme that requires every worker in the state to get a minimum 5 days of earned time off per year. It's nominally \"sick\" time but the actual structure of the law in application is \"I want the day off\".", "Which part of the second bit is incorrect? The employee will at minimum sign paperwork to the effect that they are being hired and are who they say they are.", "How does that work like you literally work 5 days a week 52 weeks a year? Except maybe the 4th of July and Christmas?", "You have a limited amount of sick days that deducted from vacation days? That's an unpleasant incentive", "I-9/W-4 are not contracts", "This started with claims about all US workers having a written and signed employment contract.\n\n\"A written employment contract is a document that you and your employee sign setting forth the terms of your relationship. **You don't have to enter into a written contract with every employee you hire. In fact, written employment contracts are generally the exception, rather than the rule.**\"\n\nhttps://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/written-employment-contracts-pros-cons-30193.html", "Essentially yes.\n\nThere isn't much choice when someone is living paycheck to paycheck.  Sick days often are unpaid, so even if someone were able to take as many as they need, their bills won't get paid.", "Yup. Assuming you're working a 'business hours', Mon-Fri job. If you're in retail or service jobs, or any other non-bank-hours job, all bets are off.\n\nI haven't seen an actual official on-the-date holiday in years, lol.", "Varies place to place.\n\nIn Manitoba, you get minimum 2 weeks of vacation time, either paid on on every check or paid at time of vacation. That number goes upto 3 weeks once you've been with the same employer for 5 years, and some employers even give more then that as the years go by. \n\nThen we have bereavement leave and sometimes bereavement pay. Not everyone gets bereavement pay, some only provide it for immediate family members like a parent or spouse dying and some provide for all relative deaths. The amount given varies company to company as only the time off without pay is requires by law to be given. \n\nWe then also have 10 paid statutory holidays (Christmas, new years day, etc.) where you either get the day off with pay, or work it at a premium of 1.5 times your hourly wage plus 5% of your earnings in the 4 weeks prior to the holiday.", "No, it\u2019s used however it\u2019s used, but it\u2019s PTO. If I take a vacation, I just use up my PTO and hope I don\u2019t get sick I guess?", "Horrific", "yeah, NYS finally mandated paid sick leave once Covid happened. \n\nNYC had done so a number of years earlier but I think it only covered employers with 5 or more employees. \n\nThe state law starts at 0- but for the first 99 employees, you only have to give them up to 40 hours a year (based on how many hours they work). So 5 full days or 10 half days- and the law explicitly says they can be taken as full or half days. (At 100 employees, it's an extra 16 hours.)\n\nAnd both laws were really focused on hourly employees who don't typically get sick time and employers who don't give it.\n\n(My office calls them doctor days- because sick days are for you are sick today. NYS sick days are for when you know in advance you are going to be out for medical stuff- or anything else covered in the law. There's a list.)", "That's quite shocking. In this kind of system people higher on the ladder earn an immense premium because those below are stripped of any rights and benefits.", "That sounds nice!\n\nMy current job has good vacation hours/separate sick hours/holidays but my longest prior job (California, mid 2000s to early 2010s) had FOUR paid statutory holidays (Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving, and July 4) and then I think like fourish days' worth of hours of \"PTO\" you had to draw from for sick/vacation. Everything else was unpaid. Monsterous.", "Yeah so if you are sick you have less vacation days? What's decent pto btw?"]}
