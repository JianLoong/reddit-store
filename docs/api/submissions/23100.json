Pregnancy can be overwhelming, and sometimes people just need empathy and support rather than advice, especially when it comes to parenting decisions.\r  \n\r  \nBoth of you could have handled the situation better. It might be best to reach out to Lily and apologize for any unintentional offense caused by your comment.

She has distanced herself & I think that you should respect that.\n\nAs for your MIL, this is the same person who suggested that Lily go to you for advice, so I certainly would not look to her for direction.  My assumption is that whenever someone asks for an apology \"to keep the peace\", they are are acknowledging that you are right, but the other party is such an AH that they will never admit it.

If it's labelled non-alcoholic, the most alcohol it might have in it is negligible.

For someone with religious, dietary or medical reasons not to consume alcohol, it would be incredibly rude not to make them aware of the presence of trace amounts.

They have a Muslim friend who will not consume this brand because of the trace presence, why should someone else who has been avoiding alcohol not be given the same chance to choose? I liken it to a friend with a nut allergy. I would never, ever feed her nuts and I read labels twice. If a nut-free food has a \u201cmade in a facility with tree nuts\u201d sticker I warn her and let her decide if she feels safe eating it. It\u2019s her choice and I cant imagine circumventing that for any reason.", "No one is missing anything.

It sounds like OP wanted SIL to know the beer was the latter kind so that she could make her own informed decision. It was probably safe to consume but she should be aware (like the Muslim friend who declines this brand) that there is a minute quantity of alcohol present. I would compare this to having a guest with a food allergy. \u201cI double checked that this food doesn\u2019t have nuts in it.

It's none of her business.", "And the ridiculous thing about MIL pointing Lily towards OP is that the number one tip for having a smooth pregnancy is simply - LUCK!\n\nYou can go into it getting all your water, exercising regularly, eating well and getting all your vitamins, and still end up with HG, or pre-eclampsia, or gestational diabetes. And someone who lives off Maccy D's and thinks walking from the sofa to the fridge is exercise, can have the easiest pregnancy imaginable. Because it's primarily down to luck. Same for people who have newborns that sleep all night, or babies that latch on and breastfeed successfully within 10 minutes of birth.\n\nThere is no magical formula. There is no trick. You can try things that might, statistically speaking, increase or decrease your chances. But really so much of it is just down to a luck of the draw, and MIL needs to get on board with that and give Lily a break.", "Small correction it is max 0.5% alcohol.", "This isn't correct. \n\nHalal is permissible and haram is forbidden, the drink can't be both of them at once. \n\nMany non-alcoholic beers and other drinks contain up to 0.5% alcohol. Someone who is avoiding alcohol for religious reasons, addiction, health etc. may wish to avoid these as they may contain a small amount of alcohol. \n\n*However* there are specifically NA beverages that advertise themselves as being truly 0.0%, not just up to the legal limit to be considered NA. There might be reasons someone would still avoid that (don't want the temptation of something similar leading them to actually drinking, don't want the appearance of drinking etc.) but there are 0.0% drinks on the market.", "Its not just amount. There are certain times during pregnancy it causes the most damage. The most vital period is during the first trimester. A lot of people dont know or haven't shared that they are pregnant during the most critical period. Its before randoms can even tell a person is pregnant.\n\nYou are a fool if you don't think doctors use random studies that confirm their biases all of the time. I work in clinical research and you would not believe some of the fuckery. Working in clinical research has made me realize how trash most of our data is. Many things cannot be measured very well but we sometimes pretend we have the perfect measure despite huge flaws in methodology. The entire system makes repeating studies not as glorious as the initial study so people dont want to do it. Nuance can't be reported as a pretty table. Much of our data is old and uses subjects that aren't very diverse. Pregnant women do not have any fda approved medications not related to pregnancy because no one wants to report ill effects and they aren't required by law to include pregnant people (even if they were, less people would probably participate unless they have a severe condition they need meds for). The result is using the general pregnant population as guinea pigs since neither women nor doctors know whats safe. They have guesses but don't have the data. If people care about fetus' health, they should be demanding laws that say pregnant women can't be excluded from studies just for being pregnant. It will help in other studies too since they typically require women to be on birth control to participate. We don't really know if that kind of requirement skews the data.\n\nThat isn't to say I wouldn't exercise caution. Its sound advice to be cautious when we don't know something. Its also ridiculous to demonize others for determining the risk is inconsequential when we do not have the data to say what amount is dangerous. Even water can poison you. Should we be telling people not to be drinking water, despite having no data that tells us how much is too much for a fetus?\n\nCaution is one thing. Treating pregnant people like community property and butting in to stop them from consuming such a tiny amount of alcohol is ridiculous. Particularly since alcohol is poisonous to everyone, yet a comment is only made on such a small amount when it concerns the fetus' health or for religious reasons. That sends the message the pregnant persons health isn't important when the only time anyone cares is to police their habits during pregnancy. People get tired of everything being about the fetus, especially when its so over the top.", "Ah, you\u2019re right!", "Should we start advising everyone who eats a banana or drinks orange juice that there is alcohol in it? People know, they just don't care about semantics because its not impactful. \n\nIt shouldn't provoke that reaction but it likely is not the first incident like this. I'd be pissed over people constantly monitoring my eating/drinking habits too. Pregnant women are not community property, despite how many people seem to think they can touch pregnant people and give them unsolicited advice just because they are pregnant. I watched my dad do it to my pregnant mom when I was 16. All of a sudden he fawned over everything she did from eating to lifting. I was wondering why he didn't give a crap about any of that when she's not pregnant. Its not like he ever picked up the slack when she was recovering from an injury. Random people would touch her and I find the whole thing pretty gross. No wonder the government has decided they own womens bodies. Society has thought they are property forever.", "You going around and harassing people for eating bananas and drinking orange juice? If not, you need to ask yourself why you aren't out there making sure everyone is aware they contain alcohol. Its not just about what you say. Its who you decide to say it to and who you dont. That amount of alcohol wont harm her or the fetus, definitely not any more than the stress of people giving unsolicited advice. By choosing only to target pregnant people, you are insinuating they are stupider than other people or that their fetus' health is more important than the pregnant person's or any other non pregnant adults health. People who treat pregnant women like community property are gross.", "YTA. There is nothing more obnoxious than giving unsolicited advice to a pregnant woman.", "YTA- we treat pregnant women like children in US. A huge list of things they can\u2019t do that women in every other country can. All to prove you aren\u2019t a horrible mother.  Can you imagine getting fetal alcohol syndrome from a barely alcoholic beer?  Do women in Japan stop eating sushi?  There are women who think \u201csoft cheese\u201d they need to avoid means cream cheese. Is unpasteurized too long of a word to learn?  It\u2019s considered awful to say this IRL but most of the precautions during pregnancy are just theatre. And I think it verges on creepy handmaid vibes.
