And normally I would suggest you explaining to him that when you did go with him why you were going. And now you don't feel the same way anymore. I can understand why he might be annoyed but name-calling and yelling is not the answer. If this person is worth it sit them down and explain why you wouldn't want them to go. If not. Girl. You don't deserve to be screamed at and called names move on to someone who doesn't feel the need to objectify women while they are in a committed relationship.", "Wtf.. bae that\u2019s.. you\u2019re nta, he\u2019s just using your sexual orientation to justify his own selfish wants", "NTA, but...why are you with him? He yells at you and calls you names because you don't want him to go and out and look at almost naked women? Personally, I don't think people in committed relationships should go to strip clubs. Why would they want to if they're truly happy with their partner?", "NTA. Do you really want to be with someone that calls you a stupid bitch?", "NTA. You are in two very different places, this often happens with teenage relationship transitioning to adult relationships. I know it's weird to trust somebody on the internet, but I can tell you from experience that there are guys out there that want to fully commit without this side stuff. You can do better. Ending a relationship is hard, but you deserve a real man who treats you well and wants what you want. I'm happily married with a child not much younger than you because I left that kind of relationship and found an actual adult who wanted what I want, got married, and had a child. Just because you were a highschool relationship doesn't mean you were meant to be. The world is a big one.", "NTA - he is objectifying you and your identity for his cheap thrills and insulting you when you draw boundaries. Dump him ASAP.", "NTA. Also you're not in a good or healthy relationship. I get that's it's really the only relationship you've known so you might think it's fairly normal or ok, but it's not. Not by a long shot.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that this strip club seems to be a bigger priority for him than your feelings is a gigantic red card. His reaction is completely reprehensible and personally I would have dumped him on the spot lol.", "NTA - however, I would suggest seriously reevaluating your relationship. I would expect this level of poor communication (on his part) in a new relationship, but not one of 6 years. Does he react this way in other situations where you don\u2019t want what he wants? Regardless, it\u2019s something to seriously consider. It\u2019s okay if your needs/values aren\u2019t perfectly aligned. What\u2019s not okay, though, is if he\u2019s dismissing your feelings like he has been with zero compromise.", "Nah you aren\u2019t the asshole at all. He is an immature shit who pays other women to shake their asses at him. \n\nIf you have the money and you were down to go to then so be it but if you aren\u2019t comfortable with the lifestyle then you absolutely have the right to set that boundary and honestly if he doesn\u2019t listen, fuck that guy.", "\u2026.i 31m been to the strip club once in my life\u2026..that shit is sad and seems like only sad desperate men go there for attention. It\u2019s a waste of money and time and if you\u2019re a man with a girlfriend or with a wife and kids\u2026.you don\u2019t deserve to be happy. You need to walk away", "NTA. \n\nEww dude. Strip clubs are straight up gross, if you don\u2019t want to date a sleemo that\u2019s like tryna go see other women nude that\u2019s absolutely a normal thing. \n\nI\u2019ll say it this way: *the majority* of girlfriends don\u2019t want their boyfriends hanging at strip clubs, because that\u2019s sleazy behavior. Auto NTA, if he isn\u2019t aware that is not normally something that a girlfriend would be cool with that\u2019s on him not you.", "He called you a stupid bitch?\n\nNta", "Years from now, when you find out he has been cheating on you, you're going to think back to this moment and realize that it was the first warning sign.", "NTA at all. Time to ditch this boyfriend. Then he can go to the strip club all he wants.", "NTA. Not seeing other women in various states of undress is a very reasonable relationship boundary that no decent guy would push. Calling you names is also awful.", "NTA dump him and run!! Calling you names and then screaming at you\u2026hell no.", "No. Your boyfriend is a weirdo. Respectfully.", "NTA.", "NTA but please don\u2019t get caught up in the whole high school sweetheart thing. It\u2019s great when that works out, but more often than not it doesn\u2019t. People grow and change as do their interests and values. It seems pretty clear here that y\u2019all have different values at this point and he\u2019s not treating you with the respect you deserve", "NTA  I would leave him, if that is what he wants let him have it.  It may take him a while to figure out that a long term committed relationship is worth so much more than going out to strippers.   Some men never do learn to value what they have at home, thinking the exotic dancers are so much sexier and love the hype. \n\nNo one deserves to be left behind or forced to go to strip clubs with their man, and they certainly don't deserve to be verbally abused.   This relationship is going down some very scary pathways.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA I\u2019ve never been in a long term relationship but any guy in one should know Strip Clubs are off limits. I don\u2019t even go as a single guy. You need a better boyfriend", "He went for the first time and then wanted to go *every weekend after that?!?* It sounds to me like he\u2019s developed a fixation. This is really strange. You might want to sit down calmly with him and point out that most guys-especially guys with a terrific SO waiting at home-don\u2019t do this on a weekly basis. Hell,I once *dated* a dancer and I didn\u2019t go to see her every week. \n\n You are NTA all around. You were a cool,secure SO for having no problem with it,you were *very* cool for going with him a couple of times\u2026and you are absolutely NTA now for seeing a problem with something that\u2019s getting out of hand. Have that talk with him ASAP,and also demand an apology for that name-calling. Best of luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But some people really enjoy the nightlife. \n\nIdk my little brother constantly goes, and dates like strippers. It's not my scene, but I've gone, and it's a good time. \n\nAns I've brought my wife and she defff was uncomfortable \n\nI'm not sure why completely, but hey, it is what it is. \n\nMy suggestions if you really want things to work with this guy, calmly just explain how uncomfortable it makes you feel, not because of infidelity but because you've experienced and it's not your cup of tea, how it affects you, him spending his night at places he knows, you don't like. \n\nAnd my other suggestion as strange as it may sound, have you considered maybe imitating some of the behavior he clearly likes at the club at home? \n\nThe dude won't want to throw money at strippers often with his friend if he knows his girl is already stripping at home. \n\nObviously, I'd sat start with 1, and allow 2 as a reward if he can tighten up, maybe even tease at the idea of you dancing at home. \n\nEven if you seriously have no plan on entertaining it, sometimes a good tease and enticing him with  either something different or \"spicy\" in bed, even just some really good sex I think could easily keep your man away from the clubs.", "It\u2019s toxic.

Release yourself from the shackles that are this man\u2019s hold on you", "NTA, this is weird behaviour. I definitely know couples and girls in general who like going to the strip club but it feels like he likes it a bit too much. I find it bizarre that he thought letting you throw a few dollars at a stripper was going to entice you to come, that in of itself is a red flag imo", "If you want a more mature family type man, move on.

Take it from someone who dated a few men who would call me names when they were angry and is now married to someone who has not once ever called me a name.
