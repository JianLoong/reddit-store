You knew somebody was committing a bit of a crime, you reported it.  Newsflash to your ex wife, child support is for the child where needed, not her.", "NTA. She is trying to cheat the system and that hurts everyone who truly depends on it.", "NTA. But it is concerning that you have custody of a child that has no relation to you, biologically or legally. Why isn't this child with his father if his mother has abandoned him?", "NTA. If the son isn't living with her and she's not passing along the money to you, she's defrauding him because the money is for the son's needs.", "NTA\n\n That money is for the child. And doesn't bio dad know he lives with you? He never talks to his son?", "NTA, that money is for the child.", "NTA\u2026the ex is paying child support to take care of his child and not for the mom to spend on her whims.  Are you allowed to be the child\u2019s guardian?  That might be problematic.", "NTA she abandoned her child and now he will likely go\nBack to his bio dad unless he gave up his rights. You really shouldn\u2019t have the kid full time without some sort of guardianship papers.", "NTA If nobody knows the child is now living with you then that his child support payment aren't coming to him they're going to his mother. That means the payments aren't benefitting him like they're supposed to. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nThis is a serious offense. She and her initial child have nothing to do with you, so don't worry about it.", "NTA", "NTA, but I have concerns for you and your step-child regarding this arrangement. What happens if the child gets hurt? You are not the parent, and you can\u2019t legally consent to medical treatment for him. What about school consent forms and stuff like that? What if, gods forbid, the child goes missing? You need to get this situation legalized for your and the child\u2019s protection.", "Esh. Whyd you wait so long", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
