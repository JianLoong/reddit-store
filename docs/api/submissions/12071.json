You are the one entitled to the child support since you have the child.

You knew somebody was committing a bit of a crime, you reported it.  Newsflash to your ex wife, child support is for the child where needed, not her.", "NTA. She is trying to cheat the system and that hurts everyone who truly depends on it.", "NTA. But it is concerning that you have custody of a child that has no relation to you, biologically or legally. Why isn't this child with his father if his mother has abandoned him?", "NTA. If the son isn't living with her and she's not passing along the money to you, she's defrauding him because the money is for the son's needs.", "NTA\n\n That money is for the child. And doesn't bio dad know he lives with you? He never talks to his son?", "NTA, that money is for the child.", "NTA\u2026the ex is paying child support to take care of his child and not for the mom to spend on her whims.  Are you allowed to be the child\u2019s guardian?  That might be problematic.", "NTA she abandoned her child and now he will likely go\nBack to his bio dad unless he gave up his rights. You really shouldn\u2019t have the kid full time without some sort of guardianship papers.", "NTA If nobody knows the child is now living with you then that his child support payment aren't coming to him they're going to his mother. That means the payments aren't benefitting him like they're supposed to. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nThis is a serious offense. She and her initial child have nothing to do with you, so don't worry about it.", "NTA", "NTA, but I have concerns for you and your step-child regarding this arrangement. What happens if the child gets hurt? You are not the parent, and you can\u2019t legally consent to medical treatment for him. What about school consent forms and stuff like that? What if, gods forbid, the child goes missing? You need to get this situation legalized for your and the child\u2019s protection.", "Esh. Whyd you wait so long", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just make sure they don't take the boy away from you.", "NTA.", "NTA, that's abhorrent behavior on your exs part!", "NTA. You should have the money OR the kid should be with his dad.", "NTA She was using the boy you're raising to commit a crime. I'm sure there's a million tax related ways that could affect you and the child (I see nothing wrong with reporting a crime of fraud no matter what, but I can already hear commenters screaming \"NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!\", so here's why it is your business).", "I am in the child's custody order as having visitation rights. The judge in the custody case said he wish I had went for custody, but I was unaware a step parent could do that.", "I'm in his custody order as having visitation rights with schedule days, weekends , and certain holidays.", "Well if I were you I would contact an attorney bc you might be the best guardian and if you make it official the support payments will go to you. You can also probably sue the ex for the back payments too.", "NTA, however for the child's stability you should try and get custody. The child wants to reside with you, mom has left her children to move out of state. And given that it sounds like bio dad doesn't even know that the child resides with you, it sounds like the parent/child relationship is non-existent with bio dad. It doesn't sound like there's anything legally stopping mom from taking custody from you if she feels vindictive enough and that just ends up hurting the child.", "Not at all NTA on a major scale. Ex should be paying you. Child support is to literally support the child and she doesn\u2019t have \u2018possession\u2019 of said child.", "YWBTA to not make sure the state is aware of the fact that you have sole physical custody of these kids right now. Not just in terms of the child's support arrangement, but for loads of other reasons as well! You need to see a family lawyer and get the custody dealt with, if one of these kids ends up in the hospital or something when you're not a custodial parent, there's going to be issues. And mom can't exactly abandon her kids with a third party when  there's a coparent who has rights of his own, too.", "NTA\n\nShe is not taking care of him, therefore she shouldn\u2019t be receiving the money for him.", "NTA BOTH parents should be paying you child support as the child\u2019s primary guardian.", "You might want to talk to his bio dad.  You two might be able to work something out."]}
