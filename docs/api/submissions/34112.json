Rules still apply.\n\n\nNew year, who dis?\n\nOh! [Dis Rule 1, our old friend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj9wlq/aita_monthly_open_forum_november_2022_civility/) We\u2019ve reviewed Rule 1 before but we had some requests to dive a little deeper, specifically with regard to armchair diagnoses. So let\u2019s do this.\n\nAs you know, Rule 1 is \u201cBe Civil.\u201d Armchair diagnoses, i.e. telling someone they have a mental disorder of some sort, are not civil. There\u2019s a couple of reasons for that. One is that usually it\u2019s clearly intended as an insult. That\u2019s uncivil at face value, but also it\u2019s really fucking messed up to use a condition that millions of people suffer from as an insult. Another reason is that you don\u2019t have the doctorate needed to diagnose anyone with anything. No, put your hand down, we don\u2019t believe you. And finally, even if you did have that degree, there\u2019s no possible way for you to accurately diagnose anyone based on a few thousand characters in a reddit post. Which is, incidentally, why it would be unethical for qualified people to do so, which you\u2019d know if you actually did have the credentials.\n\nSo how does this play out in the comments? Claiming that \u201c(person X) is a narcissist/autistic/etc.\u201d is a classic example of violating this part of the rule. No matter how much experience you may have with someone in your real life that is actually (fill in the blank condition), you can NOT diagnose someone as such based on a Reddit post. You may relate your experiences to another user, but that\u2019s about it. In short, OP isn't here for a medical diagnosis and AITA isn't here to provide it.\n\nAnother common violation we see that\u2019s related to all of this is usage of the R-slur. Yes, calling someone a \u201cretard\u201d, or any variation thereof, is *absolutely* uncivil. That includes versions such as \u201cfucktard, libtard\u201d or any other cross-breed word that one may dream up. There\u2019s more info [here](https://www.specialolympics.org/stories/impact/why-the-r-word-is-the-r-slur) on why this is a slur, and we\u2019re not accepting arguments on this point. Using it will result in you being banned from this subreddit permanently and reported to reddit for hate.\n\nSo why are we discussing this? We\u2019re asking you to judge actions, not the whole person. Making a diagnosis is inherently judging the whole person. It doesn\u2019t treat them with respect, give them an alternate perspective, or do anything to help them grow. We\u2019re not here for you to get your jollies by insulting people, and we never will be.\n\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

Now how do I describe that they should slow down playing that musical passage. /s", "Historically I've reported people for using the r slur and reddit has never taken action once for me o.o I don't think they care at all about that word, or have I been reporting it wrong and the system is automatic??", "Wtf is poo mode?", "Lol.\n\nYou guys are going to be working overtime (for free) tryna implement and remove comments. \n\nHave fun. Idc either way.", "The most common Narc diagnosis is not for Op, it's usually op's parent(s). If the parent's behavior repeatedly looks the same as a Narc would behave, might as well treat the suggested actions as if the diagnosis were true.

I got a POO mode question. With the exception of two posts, all the comments I made on posts during the recent holiday period stayed at 1 vote (at least as I could see them).

Comments I made on other subreddits behaved normally. \n\nA friend even tried interacting with one comment as an experiment and it still stuck at 1.\n\nIs this related to POO mode or a Reddit issue of some kind?", "Thanks for highlighting this more!"]}
