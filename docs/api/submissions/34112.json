{"id": 34112, "submission_id": "18wgvnk", "title": "AITA Monthly Open Forum, January 2024: Rule 1 - No Armchair Diagnoses", "selftext": "#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n\nNew year, who dis?\n\nOh! [Dis Rule 1, our old friend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj9wlq/aita_monthly_open_forum_november_2022_civility/) We\u2019ve reviewed Rule 1 before but we had some requests to dive a little deeper, specifically with regard to armchair diagnoses. So let\u2019s do this.\n\nAs you know, Rule 1 is \u201cBe Civil.\u201d Armchair diagnoses, i.e. telling someone they have a mental disorder of some sort, are not civil. There\u2019s a couple of reasons for that. One is that usually it\u2019s clearly intended as an insult. That\u2019s uncivil at face value, but also it\u2019s really fucking messed up to use a condition that millions of people suffer from as an insult. Another reason is that you don\u2019t have the doctorate needed to diagnose anyone with anything. No, put your hand down, we don\u2019t believe you. And finally, even if you did have that degree, there\u2019s no possible way for you to accurately diagnose anyone based on a few thousand characters in a reddit post. Which is, incidentally, why it would be unethical for qualified people to do so, which you\u2019d know if you actually did have the credentials.\n\nSo how does this play out in the comments? Claiming that \u201c(person X) is a narcissist/autistic/etc.\u201d is a classic example of violating this part of the rule. No matter how much experience you may have with someone in your real life that is actually (fill in the blank condition), you can NOT diagnose someone as such based on a Reddit post. You may relate your experiences to another user, but that\u2019s about it. In short, OP isn't here for a medical diagnosis and AITA isn't here to provide it.\n\nAnother common violation we see that\u2019s related to all of this is usage of the R-slur. Yes, calling someone a \u201cretard\u201d, or any variation thereof, is *absolutely* uncivil. That includes versions such as \u201cfucktard, libtard\u201d or any other cross-breed word that one may dream up. There\u2019s more info [here](https://www.specialolympics.org/stories/impact/why-the-r-word-is-the-r-slur) on why this is a slur, and we\u2019re not accepting arguments on this point. Using it will result in you being banned from this subreddit permanently and reported to reddit for hate.\n\nSo why are we discussing this? We\u2019re asking you to judge actions, not the whole person. Making a diagnosis is inherently judging the whole person. It doesn\u2019t treat them with respect, give them an alternate perspective, or do anything to help them grow. We\u2019re not here for you to get your jollies by insulting people, and we never will be.\n\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

Now how do I describe that they should slow down playing that musical passage. /s", "Historically I've reported people for using the r slur and reddit has never taken action once for me o.o I don't think they care at all about that word, or have I been reporting it wrong and the system is automatic??", "Wtf is poo mode?", "Lol.\n\nYou guys are going to be working overtime (for free) tryna implement and remove comments. \n\nHave fun.

I got a POO mode question. With the exception of two posts, all the comments I made on posts during the recent holiday period stayed at 1 vote (at least as I could see them). Not going up, not going down. Comments I made on other subreddits behaved normally. \n\nA friend even tried interacting with one comment as an experiment and it still stuck at 1.\n\nIs this related to POO mode or a Reddit issue of some kind?", "Thanks for highlighting this more!", "I wanted to thank y'all for taking 'r*tard' and its \"\"creative\"\" offshoot variants seriously.

It's been a personal issue of mine for a while, and glad to see it's not welcome here", "Also could we have a debate about banning posts involving cheating? Or at least a rule that you can't mention cheating unless it's relevant to the conflict?\n\nCheating is like an instant \"Get out of jail free\" card. You just have to slip in that the other party was cheating and you'll at most get an ESH, no matter what the actual conflict is or what you did. People throw this in all the time when the conflict is about something unrelated to get an NTA rating. There are posts like \"I did something shitty to A and everyone is mad at me, but before you judge me too harshly you should know that A once cheated on their SO\" where everyone just completely forgets that the OP did something shitty, because \"cheaters deserve to die\".", "Is the /r/AITAFiltered bot broken? (or is it actually done by Mods who are taking a well earned break?)", "Seems like this should get its own rule separate from rule 1 imo, I didn't know this was a rule. While telling someone they have a mental illness can be a way to insult them, it isn't necessarily (esp with Autism or ADHD). If someone has a post about them being very forgetful and someone says \"You have ADHD\", that's not an insult.\n\nI think the reason for banning this makes sense, but it should be separate from a rule about being civil.", "in the last two weeks i get an excessive amount of \"empty response to endpoint\" when i want to participate in this Subreddit and only this Subreddit. others work fine. is this due to the POO mode, a variation of the message that is supposed to play for the people that are not allowed to comment?", "I think it's while posts are still in contest mode.  You can't sort them, either.", "POO mode doesn\u2019t affect votes.

Those posts are banned under rule 11", "Rule 11 covers that.", "Because everything was stuck in contest mod during the break, I don't think it was able to function properly. But I will confirm with our bot master.", "We only have so many rule spots, which is why we have such an exhaustive FAQ.", "Could it possibly be from the contest mode? During the break, not only was POO mode in all the posts, but also contest mode, which seems to still be in effect for those posts (new post don\u2019t have it activated )\n\nI\u2019d love to see what the scores were for those posts.", "The word means slow. A fire retardant slows the spread of fire. Although it isn\u2019t English, ritardando means to slow down, and has the same roots. So it makes sense that you would use that as slow release medicine. The slur is from very outdated psychology", "I'm curious - would the unnecessary cheating mention -\n\n> \"I did something shitty to A and everyone is mad at me, but before you judge me too harshly you should know that A once cheated on their SO\" \n\nWould that count as a Rule 8 violation, as it's trying to bias the readers?", "Are the older posts going to be flaired by automod eventually now that they aren't poo mode? I miss going into the 'assholes' tag and finding all the juiciest stuff to read.", "I've long been unclear on the degree to which this No Armchair Diagnoses component of the civility rule applies when you're not *directly* talking about the *person*.\n\nFor instance, what about implication? \"YTA \u2014 No one likes a narcissist.\" Formally, that's just a general statement, but it's easily read as *implying* that the OP *is* one.\n\nOr what about describing *actions*, rather than the OP themselves, with this kind of language? \"ESH \u2014 That kind of narcissistic behavior is just going to drive everyone away.\"\n\nI'm especially unclear on this latter case, because like you just said:\n\n> We\u2019re asking you to judge actions, not the whole person.", "Regarding the \"no armchair diagnosis\" rule, I obviously understand why it's in place but I want to ask if this rule is serious to the point of the removal of any comments that are actually trying to be helpful and acknowledging a lack of ability to diagnose. Those good old \"hey, you're describing something consistent with XYZ, you might find it helpful to see a professional about the possibility\".\n\nThere are loads of situations this happens organically in the sub regarding things that aren't generally considered insults to tell someone, like \"It sounds like you/she might have PPD, you should talk to your doctor.\" Heck, I stumbled across one a few weeks ago regarding someone who went non-verbal for a day and got criticized for using autistic coping methods and describes herself as having an autistic sister, and all her friends are autistic, and this feeling of being totally overwhelmed and completely unable to talk for a day, and even though I know armchair diagnosis is against the rules my first thought was, \"It might be helpful to this person to seek a diagnosis.\" Not because autism is bad and I'm insulting her, but because she legitimately sounded like dozens of autistic women who didn't get diagnosed as children struggling as adults who've gotten diagnosis into adulthood and found that to be legitimately a helpful step in learning to cope and exist as who they are. And even if I'm wrong about the potential for autism, going non-verbal for a day is a non-standard experience and she might be directed towards the correct diagnoses of something else by a professional. \n\nBasically the TL;DR here is that I'm wondering if it's against the rules to say \"hey, you might find it helpful to see a professional because you possibly have x\" if it's clear by the context it's meant in an \"advice\" way and not an \"x is a bad thing shame on you\" way?", "That's what I was curious about as well.", "Why are people in this thread so downvote happy? Dude's asking a question in the thread that exists for it, jeez.\n\n>\"empty response to endpoint\"\n\nThat's a common thing to see when reddit's like *semi* broken - not down, but not functioning properly. It's not unheard of it to selectively impact users. Nothing to do with our specific sub though.", "Implied insults, backhanded insults, and insulting someone while drawing a comparison to OP (or anyone else, really) all fall under rule 1. Otherwise it would be a chaotic loophole.\n\n>That kind of narcissistic behavior \n\nThis is a a super specific example that actually would be okay. Narcissism is one of a few things where you can act in a narcissistic way without having NPD or BPD with narcissistic tendencies. But \"psychopath behavior\" or \"cunt behavior\" (something I have seen stubborn people try after a warning like they're clever and we haven't thought of that) are *not* loopholes.", "ah, thank you very much for your answer :)\n\ni was a bit confused as it kept happening only here and worked fine somewhere else minutes later and started to worry it was some hidden kind of ban or else", "What about asshole behaviour?", "The report menu does have meta posts and judgement-bot violations under the same point. Perhaps rule 1 could also get an \"incivility/armchair diagnosis\" description?", "Asshole is the only explicitly permitted insult so, of course, it's fine.", "Depends on the context. But if it's something like OP coming in after the fact, it could be a rule 8 (presented unfairly).", "That's a good idea!", "Question: Are we going to have the voting debate for best posts this year?", "Question: Does \"unhinged\" fall into the armchair/incivil rule, or is it an acceptable description for someone acting unreasonable?", "English and German are both West Germanic languages, so it was fair to assume the words have similar meanings. In fact, they do... ish. bobthemundane already addressed this, but I just wanted to explain a bit more, in case you still felt bad. It seems you had no ill will, so you really shouldn't beat yourself up over it. Plenty of people think that (as I've learned in my French class) similar languages are easy to understand, just use \"mots amis\" which are words that sound similar and mean the same thing. Another thing I learned in French class is that the term \"en retard\" means late, which is similar to slow.\n\n(This was poorly written and not structured very well, but I'm tired :(, I'm sorry)"]}
