I am a huge proponent of planning for the worst while hoping for the best. There are a myriad of circumstances that could play out in the future, many of them out of her control. He could leave her or she could need to leave him. He could lose his medical license. He could pass away prematurely or get afflicted with an illness or injury that won't allow him to work. Faced with dire circumstances it is a disaster not to have a stable career and work history of your own.\n\nAs an example, my friend, also a mother of twins, was a SAHM. When the kids were 10ish, her husband died suddenly (aneurysm.) She found herself on her own with no health insurance, no income, no work history, and few prospects. She immediately got two part time jobs but didn't have health insurance. It was in this chaotic period that she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was alone with a very modest income and needed to continue to work while going through chemo, radiation, and surgery. It was a complete disaster. \n\nMy other friend put his girlfriend, fiancee, and eventually wife through medical school in their home country. She wanted to practice in the US, so they used his life savings to relocate to the eastern seaboard. He continued to pay all of their living expenses while she studied for the boards. In the US, he was working a much more modest job, security guard for a hotel. After she passed the boards and secured a job, she dumped his ass and went on to marry another doctor. His parents were lawyers in their home country, which is what he wanted to do too. But, he put her educational goals first. His plan was to go to law school when she started working. Best laid plans of mice and men. He had to move in with his brother in California and take a job as a security guard at a hotel. \n\nI've also had many clients in very difficult circumstances. It is a mistake to put all of your eggs in someone else's basket. Everyone needs to formulate a plan to survive on their own. We can't control all of life's variables but we can put ourselves in a better position to deal with difficult circumstances.", "Yes, it is a hobby.", "Her husband is a surgeon, I doubt he is doing as much as you do. It is great you are pulling your weight, but that is not most people's experience.", "Fair is fair.", "While not a surgeon, I generally work 10 to 11 hour days most light weeks and other times I may be gone for days and or weeks at a time. I can\u2019t say that it has been smooth sailing the entire time. I have had AH moments in the past where I felt like I was carrying more of the load so I definitely understand these post."]}
