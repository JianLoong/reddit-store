I definitely understand how close sisters can be, but boundaries should always be respected. \n\nMaybe your sister made a dumb mistake by sending the picture, felt embarrassed, and is lashing out at you now?

Idk in what world sending your genital pics to your siblings is ok. I grew up with my nephew being around the same age as me, and we grew up not as uncle and nephew but as brothers.

There is a clear, distinct line between pictures of your body clothed, and literally explicit pictures of genitalia.

She never asked you if you were okay with her literally sending you her nudes and then got offended when you told her it was not okay.

And although different she felt comfortable enough to come to you with this. Look I'm not saying you have to be okay with the pictures, but if you love your sister and your family and are a decent person just apologize to her. It may not be important to you but she literally trusts you with the absolutely most intimate information abou herself, that is not a trust to be broken lightly.\n\nThis whole situation should have been approached differently, but seriously. Ask yourself if you are willing to  jeopardize your your family relationships for this honestly small issue. (Please, don't misunderstand. I'm not downplaying your feelings. I just hope you will be truly honest with yourself whether this situation is bad enough and is worth tearing your family apart.
