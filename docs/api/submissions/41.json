In addition to this, on the way to engagement drinks, I was followed out of the tube and harassed by a man who wouldn\u2019t leave me alone until I eventually ran away.

I still had a smile on my face on arrival and chatted with everyone, I also made the group toast to the happy couple. However, I was much quieter than I usually am and mostly observed the night whilst sat at the table. I\u2019m typically more vivacious and lively. I didn\u2019t mention the events of that week on the night, although the bride to be is aware having spoken earlier that day. But, as I said, I was quiet and probably looked rather somber at what is meant to be a happy celebration. \n\nThe next day my best friend and bride to be launched into a tirade of saying I wasn\u2019t my usual self and how she thought I didn\u2019t even want to be there. I admitted I wasn\u2019t my usual self and apologised for any upset it may have caused but also defended the fact that I had gone to celebrate and just because I have something going on, it doesn\u2019t eradicate my happiness for her but it had just been a rough day so I was a bit quieter than usual.

If you don\u2019t get a profuse apology and an offer of support dealing with what you\u2019re going through in the *very* near future, I would severely limit your involvement with her and the wedding, because this does not bode well for what dealing with her as a bride is going to be like.", "Yeah NTA. Definitely not. \n\nSounds like she is annoyed about other stuff, and this is displaced aggression. Or maybe she really is just that self absorbed that she expects you to make her the centre of your universe. Can\u2019t say with more context. But given what you\u2019re already coping with, she should bring grateful that you not only turned up, but helped her out with planning etc. \n\nAlso, her feelings are not your responsibility. You have apologised and it was heartfelt, not sarcastic or obligatory. \n\nI would keep my distance from her for a while. Focus on the other things happening in your life. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate your feelings or behaviour, or tell you what\u2019s important to you. You did your best, and if that\u2019s not good enough for her\u2026 well tough.

She\u2019s clearly disappointed her engagement drinks didn\u2019t go the way she planned and maybe she finds you an easy outlet for her frustration. I\u2019m sure when the dust settles she might be able to see it from your side and understand that you showing up while you had so much going on is more than the friends that couldn\u2019t be bothered to stay.

I have a feeling it's going to be a tough ride!", "NTA. People have moods. You were happy for her, you just had a rough day.\n\nAnd you were *literally* a victim earlier that day.\n\nYou didn't drag people down, you didn't ruin her party, you were just a little quiet. It's fine.", "NTA. You were there to support and celebrate her despite everything else going on in your life. Her expectation of you to be solely focused on her and her happiness is unreasonable.

I remember when my mother died and a friend had organised dinner. I showed up, but I really didnt want to be there. She gaslit me for feeling that way, and although we put it behind us, I still feel sad when I think of it. It sounds like your friend is taking out her disappointment on you. And you have two choices: Either accept it and brush it under the rug and move on. Or stand up for yourself and dont allow her to gaslight you into thinking that that this behaviour is a normal part of any friendship. You deserve better!

NTA obviously and speedy recovery to your grandparents!!", "If she asks you to be a bridesmaid, just say no. She sounds so self centered that she was berating you when you had such a shit-storm day.

I wouldn't make you feel bad for being quieter but just so grateful you turned up with so much going on. Yes as happy I am for you and fiance for you engagement it does not take away all the hurt I have going on. I apologise for seeming quieter but at least I showed up and stayed which is more than most of your friends.\"", "Absolutely NTA, and I'm sorry that you're going through so much stuff at the same time - it's tough.

Wow.", "NTA but wedding planning and wedding events are going to be FUN!", "NTA. Ask yourself why are you friends with this person? It\u2019s only going to get worse.", "NTA.\n\nI would be very careful about accepting any sort of role in her wedding. The Bridezilla warning signs are heavy with this one.", "NTA.  Interesting that nowhere in this interaction does she ask about how you are doing.  That says a lot.", "NTA wow she is not a good friend at all but you are. I would put some distance between you for a while.", "NTA. Bridezilla warning!", "NTA - she is!  I would seriously have 2nd thoughts on standing up for her in a wedding because if she is this entitled now imagine what kind of BRIDEZILLA she will be. \n\nShe is upset really with the others, but because you are closer she feels comfortable going after you and that is not really a good friend.  I had this happen, I had just found out my grandmother was dying in the hospital  and only had days or hours to live, I had also just suffered a miscarriage that week and my friend had her baby and wondered why I didn't come down to see her and her new baby.  I explained I did not have the energy nor the emotional stability to celebrate with her at that particular time (my grandmother ended up dying later that night).  Mind you I had planned and host a large baby shower for her, helped her get ready for her maternity photos and dog sat their pets while they went on a babymoon!

The engagement, etc", "Not sure if I\u2019m understanding you properly.

Can you explain why?", "Please excuse YOURSELF from this entire thread. Stupid is as stupid does.", "it\u2019s pretty clear here that if OP had said that they weren\u2019t in a headspace to celebrate then her bestie would have been even MORE mad at her.

For the ENGAGEMENT. No. No, this is too much. This is not the shower, nor the rehearsal, nor the actual wedding. It\u2019s drinks with friends, and OP set it up and did the toast.

There was no winning, but she tried her best.", "I don\u2019t think you know how engagements work. A bride is marrying the groom on her wedding day (cishet scenario).
