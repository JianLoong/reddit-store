I don't often but my car broke down. Me and 2 other strangers were the only people on the bus, both were female, and one had a small dog with her (pets are allowed on busses in my area.) I'll call the aggressor \"Ann\" and the woman who had a dog \"Beth\" just so this reads easier. Obviously I have no clue what either of their names are. \n\nLong story short, Ann started yelling at Beth for \"not taking care of her dog.\" I didn't pay attention to the whole conversation, but I think it started with Ann telling Beth that her Dog looked \"sick\" and thin. Beth explained she was worried for the dog but couldn't afford proper vet care and was trying everything she could. (I agree the dog looked unwell but also I wouldn't have noticed if the woman never started making a scene about it.)\n\nThe conversation got heated and Ann started accusing Beth of \"animal abuse.\" She said things like \"you shouldn't have a dog if you can't afford it\" and \"that poor thing should live with me.\" She was yelling at her and freaking out. \n\nBeth at some point looked like she was about to cry. She obviously cares about the dog a lot and I'm sure a stranger yelling at her like that felt horrible. After a while I felt so bad I decided I needed to say something. \n\nI told Ann to mind her own business and that the lady was probably trying her best she possibly could. Vets are expensive and financial situations can change and be unpredictable at times. \n\nShe then started to go off at me saying I need to stay out of it and it's not nice to interject in the conversation of people I don't know. She said I should keep to myself. (But she started  bullying a random stranger out of nowhere?)\n\nShe also accused me of \"defending animal abuse\" and said we were both disgusting for letting an innocent animal suffer. Eventually she was kicked off the bus. \n\nAITA? I know involving yourself in other people's conversations is a social taboo but I feel like this was an exception. Is it wrong in general to defend \"Beth\" here?", "created_utc": 1684494711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lsewp/aita_for_standing_up_for_a_stranger_in_public/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ann was unhinged and had no business berating Beth. Good for you for standing up to her. Glad she got kicked off the bus.", "NTA y'all were all on public transport. If Ann felt like she could share her hot take with Beth, then I don't see how you sharing your hot take with ann could make you an asshole. Thank you for having the courage to stick up for a stranger nobody deserves to be harassed", "NTA- If she was concerned for the dog she could have offered a vet/shelter that helps people struggling taking care of their pets!", "NTA. You defended a person in distress.", "NTA, speaking up for others does not make you an asshole.", "I say NTA but honestly I do kind of agree with \"Ann\" in this situation. \n\nExploding at a random stranger on a bus is absolutely uncalled for and inexcusable. So good on you for standing up for the person being yelled at and telling \"ann\" to mind her business. \n\nBut... \n\nIn general her points weren't incorrect. If you can't afford to properly care for or provide for a dog that's a good sign to either find financial aid or give the dog to another home (either temporarily or permanently depending on exact circumstances.) Pets aren't just items to tote around, they're living breathing animals who deserve to be healthy and get the medical attention necessary.", "NTA. What on earth is wrong with people who can\u2019t just mind their own business and feel the need to harass strangers?", "NTA. You did the right thing by standing up for Beth, who was being harassed and bullied by Ann. Ann had no right to judge Beth\u2019s situation or try to take her dog away from her. She was being rude, intrusive, and insensitive. You were not defending animal abuse, you were defending a person who was clearly struggling and doing her best to care for her pet. You were not interjecting in a conversation, you were intervening in a conflict that was causing distress to Beth. You should be proud of yourself for being brave and compassionate.", "NTA", "NTA. Ann sounds like she can't tell Twitter and reality apart. If she truly wanted the best for the animal she could have offer to help the dog and the owner but no, she just wanted to bath in her perceived moral superiority. Thank you for standing up for Beth!", "NTA but BOTH the other women are. Poor dog.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
