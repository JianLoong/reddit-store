I\u2019m 32, had my 1st car for 10 years and then traded it in to my current small SUV that is now 12 years old and paid off. It runs well and still looks nice - it just has a lot of miles and isn\u2019t trust worthy of longer trips. Just a ride around town.\n\nMy in laws go through cars like crazy. I think my mother in law alone has had over 6 SUVs in the past 8 years. My in laws have some money, so it really isn\u2019t my business what they do. Until now\u2026..The situation is this:\n\nMy husband has had a few cars his parents bought him when he first started driving. A few years ago, he previously purchased his first truck, and had it for a few years. We were so proud to do that together. My father in law decided to upgrade his truck, and convince my husband to take over payments of his current lifted Chevy Colorado so they could use his work truck to trade it in for a bigger diesel. At the time, I agreed that this was a good idea to do. We\u2019ve had the newer truck for a while now and I\u2019ve grown to love it. The title was never shifted to my husbands name, so basically he was just making the payments. \n\nNow, my father in law wants a bronco. He ordered one without saying much to us, and then proposes that he takes the Chevy Colorado and trade that truck in for the bronco since it has more equity. He is basically giving my husband his bigger diesel truck and telling him that he would make the payments for him since he knows we can\u2019t afford it. My husband is used to his parents giving him nice things, but we had one conversation about it and he agreed that he didn\u2019t want to trade in his current truck. This just makes me feel icky all over that no one included me in this conversation/decision afterwards - instead they hid it from me until the trade happened because they knew I wouldn\u2019t agree with it. It\u2019s a truck we can\u2019t even afford to buy!! Very showy look-at-me truck. Like the other truck, I\u2019m sure we will get compliments about it strangers/friends, and my husband will act like he bought it himself. Why drive something out of our means? It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\n\nHere I am over here just saving, and waiting for the day I can get myself a newer car eventually so I can drive to visit my family (5 hr away) whenever I want to.

The two of you have been \"renting\" that truck.  It isn't yours.  So, legally, his dad could come pick it up tomorrow and you wouldn't be able to do a darn thing about it.\n\nAnd if you take the diesel, the exact same thing would happen.  \n\nThe reality is that while you think your ILs \"have some money\", they probably aren't nearly as well off as you imagine.  They have \"stuff\" and they have payments to make, but they probably don't have much real financial security.   You're probably better at handling money than they are.  Because you know a bad deal when you hear one.\n\nIf you and your husband can afford to do so, your husband should tell his Dad that he really likes the truck he's been driving.  DH should offer to get a (modest) loan from the bank if FIL will sell him the truck.  FIL could then trade in the diesel and use the cash from you guys buying the truck to buy his new rig.", "NTA. \nMy in laws have some money and go through vehicles like they\u2019re a pair of shoes. So I totally understand your situation. \n\nWhat your man needs to realize is you guys need to keep your finances separate from his parents. This is to ensure if his parents go bankrupt or get in a bind, you two aren\u2019t stuck with something you can\u2019t afford. \n\nSecondly, you need to make sure he understands that your opinion matters. The fact they made this decision without including you is a breach of trust and a much bigger issue.\n\nI fear their may be much more of this behavior later down the road for you if you don\u2019t nip this in the bud now. Take control of your finances and your life. Do not let money take control of you. Good luck to you.", "Wait, so they had your husband take over payments on a truck, which they are then taking back from him and trading in? That doesn\u2019t seem fair. Even if they \u201cgive\u201d him this other truck and help with the payments it\u2019s in no way helping him have ownership of anything.", "NAH. except your in laws maybe. As long as your in laws' choices don't affect your finances (i bet the gas is more $$!) I guess as long as hubby is fine with it, it isn't a big deal. The way you frame it, you're jealous of your husband's vehicles being like his parents': new and hardly used before getting a newer one. I don't like the control your in laws are able to exert on your family, but that's just me. Free expensive things make me nervous about strings attached. You say your hubby said he didn't want the new truck, is he just saying that to appease you, or is he just accepting the new truck to appease them? Idk what kind of judgment to give, but I'd be uncomfortable in a relationship like this, but have trouble explaining why. I guess it's the image of control from people outside the relationship?", "I'm kind of confused after reading your post. I don't think you're an AH for being left in the dark about this. You're married, things should not be hidden. \n\nSo, NTA? Or ESH?", "NTA....but your ILs and husband are. Eventually you guys will get stuck with a payment that you won't be able to make.  It's time to separate finances from the IL.  Give the truck back and buy a used  truck or car.  \n\nI trade in cars alot too. About every two years and I have gotten to the point of high payments.  Now, I have realized it wasn't financially healthy to do this.  I love my truck though so I am keeping it and rearranging my budget to cope.  \n\nBottom line is get out from underneath your in laws.", "NAH because these are just feelings. But this isn't an \"in-law\" problem.\n\nBe upset all you like---you both agreed to the original bad deal (\"The title was never shifted to my husbands name, so basically he was just making the payments\") and your husband agreed to the new bad deal.\n\nYou're in your 30s and married, the two of you are in control of what happens in your life. When a decision \"doesn't make sense,\" the person you need to convince is your own spouse.", "I think you are NTA because this is a weird situation. You are stuck driving the vehicle that is actually within your household means while your husband gets to roar around in a massive boytoy that makes no sense. I don\u2019t know why your FIL is so obsessed with getting trucks. What he\u2019s doing is a massive waste of money. I too would be embarrassed and confused in this situation. But I think the fix here is to leverage it. Your husband has a free car it sounds like. It also sounds like you need a more dependable ride. You two cannot afford what the in-laws are doing so don\u2019t try to keep up but do get a new car that you and hubby can both make payments on. Or, I know it\u2019s expensive, but rent a car to go visit your family-way cheaper than car payments.", "NTA Yes, your husband should have discussed this with you. I think that was your main question. \nBut everything else is a mess. If you're not making payments on this new truck, then appreciate it. You can save what you would've been making in payments and put towards your own car in your names only. The constant trading in is a waste of money but that's on your in-laws. I'm confused where you said they took his work truck for trade-in, is that the truck husband bought on his own? If so then ESH because you guys could have said no but you thought it was a good idea. That's why in-laws think they can keep doing this. If they needed his truck, then these people aren't that well off. They just keep buying things on credit and won't have much to show in the end.", "ESH.\n\nHoly crap, that was hard to follow.  But it boils down to, your husband has been driving a vehicle where the title is not in his name.  Now FIL wants to trade that vehicle, and give your husband access to another vehicle where that other vehicle also does not have your husband's name on the title.  Amiright?\n\nTalk about dysfunctional.  I think the only way this situation could get more screwed up is if you two were to move into FIL's basement.  Then ask FIL permission when you two think you might be ready to start trying to get pregnant.\n\nOn a side note, why is your 12 year old SUV not reliable?  My car is a 2001 Nissan.  If I wanted to take a cross-country drive of 3000 miles, all I would have to do is top off the tank.  I could even skip that part.  (Gas stations are easy to find on the way)  It's not how old your car is or even how many miles are on it.  It's how it has been maintained.  I have full confidence in my vehicle, and it's quite a bit older than yours.\n\nBut back on topic.  This whole family has serious boundary issues.  I can't believe your hubby is OK with driving (and making payments?) on a car that's not even his.  Wow.  Consider mind blown.", "ESH. Stop accepting vehicles from your in-laws and making payments on things that are not in your name. It doesn't benefit you financially or credit-wise, and your in-laws are taking advantage of the situation to be irresponsible and buy impulsively.", "Does your husband like the new truck himself?  Then do nothing about this one.  If your husband does not, then have him ask to use new truck to trade in for new version of old truck.  Reason?  You\u2019re missing the old truck and just like the drive better.  Have your husband break out some mechanical reasons.  I\u2019d think FIL would accept that if they think you\u2019re downgrading.", "Ibhave a friend who is a car salesman and makes posts about people like your ILs lol.\n\nBeing dependent on them for transport feels precarious, controlling. But that isn't changing.", "I'm confused by this post... If I understand correctly you're upset because a) this isn't a truck you would be able to afford without his parents help and b) you haven't been informed about the exchange? I think those are valid reasons to be upset, but I have to say the title to this post is misleading and kinda makes you sound like a little bit of an ah. You sound like you feel entitled to a car that you only had cause his parents made it possible.\n\nHas there been any understanding between your husband and his parents that he pays the truck off, so he could keep it in the end? And what about this new truck? It sounds like he's basically renting out of his leage cars from his parents and relying on them to provide him with status symbols and frankly that's just dumb... He needs to grow up and be independend.\n\nI'll vote NAH though because frankly  I get how you're annoyed with this whole system, however if your husband and his parents like it this way it doesn't really make them assholes either.

My in laws have some money and FIL loves his work truck with all the bells and whistles but it also gets fully paid for the day he brings it home.", "I\u2019m kind of reading into this that the reason they have to trade in the truck her husband is driving is because it\u2019s older and the loan on it is farther paid down (thanks to her husband) than on any of the other cars. It is quite possibly the only one he can get some money off of and not end up having to roll negative equity into his next loan. \n\nThis set up makes it sound like he\u2019s underwater on the Diesel.

You are right to be wary and to try to set up some boundaries. \n\nI can guarantee your husband is going to resist doing that though.
