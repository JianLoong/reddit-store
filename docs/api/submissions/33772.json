Today my grandpa is coming over for christmas brunch, my parents were picking him up and they asked my brother and me to clear up the table. All of our christmas presents were still on the table. So we go downstairs and my brother starts watching TV while I clear the table, when the whole table is empty except for my brothers presents I ask him to please clean them up and to take them upstairs. He gives me 0 reaction. I ask again louder, thinking maybe he hadn't heard me. This time i get a sarcastic \"yes mom\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 i'll do it in a second\" . My parents were coming home literally any minute so after a few minutes i ask again and he still won't get up. \nBefore i continue i need to tell you some context. My brother and father don't do ANYTHING in this household, my mom does every single thing on top of her job. My father and brother think that because they work jobs they filled their duties and don't have to do anything else but my mom works too and it isn't even questioned that she makes dinner every night and does all the cleaning and gets the groceries etc. I try to help her but i literally can't keep up. My mom and i have said plenty of times that they have to contribute to the household but they just won't and i am so done with it. We have told them this in calm converstaions, they'll say that they will change but it never does.\n\nSo today when i asked my brother to clean up his presents (which is a task that would have took him about 3 seconds) and he wouldn't do it, i got pretty irritated. I told h that if he won't clean them up i'll throw them away. He didn't believe me and said that i would never do that. I took his shampoo and opened the kitchen trash can. There was no other trash in there besides some plastic (i checked before hand) and told him once more that he needs to clean his shit up. He still wouldn't get up so i threw the shampoo away. I feel like he deserved it and he obviously can just take it out again, i just wanted to make a statement. \nWhen i said my father has anger issues before, it isn't just my dad. My brother can get really mad and he ran towards me and i braced for impact but then he ran upstais and took a t shirt that was lying IN MY ROOM and came downstairs are threw it away. It isn't that big of a deal bc the trash is still just plastic and i can just put it in the washer but it is so annoying to me how he thinks he is amazing and right when in reality, he is entitled and lazy. His argument is that i didn't clean the shirt up but it is literally in my room and also he hasn't asked me if i would clean it up, he just threw it away. \n\nI know my reaction is a bit over the top but he won't listen to anything else, just asking normally does not work.\nAm i the asshole?", "created_utc": 1703591945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r6n74/aita_for_throwing_my_brothers_christmas_present/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is being very entitled. God knows why your mum just puts up with it from them both.", "I'm not sure you were an asshole, exactly, but it seems like an odd approach. At a basic level, what's at stake for you here? You're not your brother's manager. You are, theoretically, his coworker. Your parents delegated the task to both of you, and for some reason you did 99% of the task on your lonesome, and then became resentful when he didn't do the 1%. Which, realistically, there should be some frigging resentment when you cross the 60% mark. \n\nWhat I'd ask, therefore, is why you don't just do half the job. It's a task for both of you, you've done your part, and it's not actually your duty to keep your brother on task. You say you want him to do his part, but, presently, the thing that happens when he doesn't do his part is that you finish somewhere between 99% and 100% of the task without him. Notably, he still would have benefited from his lackadaisical television watching even if he'd immediately removed his gifts from the table. If your parents get mad at you for leaving incomplete a task you completed halfway, then I think we've identified the actual problem in this situation.", "INFO: If you had put away your presents and left your brother\u2019s for him to take care of, would you have gotten in trouble?", "NTA\n\nBut you are a GREAT SON!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
