I haven't seen my biological father since I was just under a year old - I live in the US and he lives in the UK. \n\nGrowing up I was always under the impression that my mom moved back home and he didn't want to follow and then divorced my mom a few years later and also didn't want contact. All I knew is that he was paying child support. But when I asked mom about things, she was always evasive and even defended him and was never horrible about him. \n\nI didn't have a dad in my life until mom met my stepdad when I was 6 and we developed a great bond. So when I was 12, I asked my mom if he could adopt me and she said he wouldn't be able to unless my father agreed to it. She said she had contact details for his family and him and I should get in touch to get to know him a bit and then if I still wanted dad to adopt me then ask him. \n\nSo I got into contact and he was ecstatic to talk to me - he was very different to how I expected. But I still didn't really have any feelings for him as a dad so asked him after a while if he would let my dad adopt me. After a while, he agreed but said he couldn't face us being in contact and didn't want a relationship with me if we went through with it. I still agreed. \n\nNot long after, I received a goodbye letter from him and he told me what happened. Basically, he told me my mom took me home to the US one day while at work and he didn't agree with it. He said he tried to fight against it but my mom made it hard and he subsequently had a breakdown and lost contact with me. That it took him years to get over it and that's why he now needs to cut contact. I asked mom if it was true and she admitted it was. I was disgusted, dad was too - it nearly split them up because he felt like he was lied to but stayed together because mom not long had a baby (my brother).\n\nAfter a couple of years and the adoption went ahead, I think about him a lot now and his sacrifice and I'd love to get in touch with him and thank him and see if he wants contact again. I asked mom if I should and she said no, we should leave him alone now and let him heal - it caused a major argument and she said if I do, I'll be in a lot of trouble.\n\nI really am torn - WIBTA if I get in contact?", "created_utc": 1686390200, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145vy0j/wibta_for_getting_in_touch_with_my_biological/", "score": 16, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sorry this happened.", "This must be very hard and a difficult situation for you to be in. And that your mum lied about what happened even when you were reaching out to your father.\n\nBut your father told you very clearly that if you decided to get adopted by your stepdad that he would not want to maintain contact with you. \n\nHe had clearly suffered thoroughly when your mother basically abducted you out of his life and it's good 6 right not to go through that again.\n\nIf you have details for one of his parents or siblings, you could potentially write to them asking if they feel he would be able to handle you getting back in touch but be prepared for the answer to be no or for there to be no answer.\n\nNone of this is your fault, you are a child and the actions of others placed you in this situation. At the same time, your father has a right to protect himself from being hurt yet again.\n\nNAH except maybe your mum, not for leaving him but for the way she did it while he was at work. (Unless he was abusive, in which case surely she wouldn't have encouraged you to get in touch, this seems very cruel.)", "Id say you would be yeah, he told you the truth about what happened and your mom admitted it, and you still legally wrote that man out of your life. Kinda harsh to say, but you made your bed.", ">I asked mom if I should and she said no\n\nWell sure, your mom doesn't want you talking to the victim of her parental kidnapping or whatever it was. Last time you talked to him her current husband almost divorced her.  I wouldn't take her advice on this. \n\nFor some reason, my question is this. Are you a US citizen, is you biological father a UK citizen, and could you gain citizenship to the UK if he filled out some forms? Because, if so, I'd see that as a big deal and perhaps something worth following up on, even if he said he didn't want contact. \n\nOr do you already have a UK passport (or could he not help you get one because he's American) ?", "YWBTA - I'm sorry OP, but you made your choice when bio dad opened up about his true feelings. He's lost you twice now both times out of his control, how does he know there won't be a 3rd time. \n\nUnless its a medical emergency where you need paternal medical history please leave him alone, if he wants a relationship he'll contact you first", "YWBTA. You made your decision, and you need to stick to it. Leave bio-dad alone. He doesn\u2019t deserve more pain.", "YWBTA.

He said a therapist in the end told him it wasn't for the best to keep on reaching out because it was really bad for him. Apparently he tried to unalive a few times\".\n\nEven more reason to LEAVE HIM ALONE.", "OUCH to be asked to let another man adopt you. He was happy to hear from you only to get hit with that. At that point what is the point in saying no your mom would take him out of the picture again. You were 12 though and TBH not old enough to understand the situation your mom put you in. If you want any chance with your biological father I would recommend starting with an apology and explain what you though then and what you learned now. Your dad has been seriously hurt his child taken from him, then further ripped away from him and given to another man. He may not want back into your life period after all that and you'll need to accept that. It isn't your fault, it is your mothers, but sadly you are probably going to have to pay the price.", "Look into whether the adoption by an American affects your right to get the UK passport. I don't know.\n\nOne thing I'm also wondering, and her may be wondering too, is why you wanted the other guy to adopt you. Is this something your mom and stepdad were pushing for any reason? \n\nMay I ask, what story did your mom tell you growing up about what happened to your dad, and was that story true or false, and as that the impression you were operating under when you decided you wanted the adoption.\n\nJust imagine your father's situation. His child is \"stolen\" from him and taken to a far away country where he can't legally get the child back or see the child again.  Which would have been devastating.\n\nThen the lost child contacts him 11 years later and he's ecstatic. He has his child back in his life. Only to later learn that the contact from the child seeking to reconnect was a kind of pretext for the child to give him the middle finger and say \"I want someone else to be my father.\"  That was probably very hurtful to him.\n\nIf you do contact him again, think about that.  If you can lay the foundation for explaining that you were manipulated and lied to by your mother who said he abandoned you two, and had you known the truth you never would have done the adoption, that may help to \"smooth things over\" so to speak.  Maybe give it another year or two though.", "YWBTA, leave the poor man alone. He's not your dad any more so you have to stop calling him that. Respect his boundaries, he told you very politely that once you denounce him as your father he cannot go through the trauma of staying in contact. To reach out to him now is extremely selfish", "YWBTA, he asked you not to", "YWBTA \n\nHe told you if you went through with it he wanted no contact \n\nYou could maybe put feelers out and send a letter to his family explaining you had no idea any of this had happened, but I think that would just cause him pain at this point \n\nI would also stop asking your mum for advice on this, she caused it", "It\u2019s a good question.\n\nHe\u2019s not your dad anymore, he\u2019s a private citizen who said he doesn\u2019t want contact.\n\nOn the other hand you are literally a kidnapping victim who was manipulated by your mom.\n\nI don\u2019t know. I think it comes to how important contact is to you. If you\u2019re doing this on a whim then hold off. If it\u2019s important to you then I\u2019d say maybe YWBTA, but you\u2019re also a 16 year old in an unfair position, so I\u2019d have a hard time faulting you.", "NAH That was a ridiculous decision for any of your parents to put on you. You were 12 and just wanted a dad who was there for you. Nobody gave you the full context of the situation before you made the decision. I think when you're a little older you could try to reach out to your birth dad but be aware he may just ask you to leave him alone. It also depends what kind of relationship you're looking for with him and where he might be at on life or how his process of grieving the loss the first times has affected him.", "You were manipulated by your mother. She literally took you from your father, never told you details, and the only time you were given his details was to ask if your stepfather could adopt you. At the age of 12. \n\nYou were NOT responsible for what happened. The person you should be upset with is your mother. Your bio dad was wronged by her on multiple fronts and, while I disagree with his attitude, he did what he needed to do to heal. \n\nNTA. \n\nHowever, you need to write a letter to your bio dad. Tell him it\u2019s not your fault you were taken from him, and it\u2019s not your fault that A CHILD was manipulated. You wish he would reconsider but you understand his needing to protect himself. That you\u2019re hurt and that you had no idea what was going on and could do nothing about it.

And I don't think you would be the asshole at all for contacting him for that purpose. Tell him you'll respect his wishes for not having future contact and that the point of this is to set up your future and that you have no immediate plans to travel to or live in the UK, that's not the point.\n\nIt might be better if you wait until you're almost 18 before you do this, lest he be concerned about becoming responsible for you if you got a UK passport and went to the UK as a child. Or concerned about your mom suing him for child support or something.

Good luck.", "You're not an asshole is any of this because you've obviously been manipulated by your mother from a young age. But you have to understand your fathers POV. If you still think you should reach out after that then it should only be to ask him to adopt you back or something like that. Anything else will be a dagger to his heart. He would never have been able to do what your mother did. He would have been charged with kidnapping because he's a man and they don't let men run off with the child the way they do with women. I feel for you and for him and to some extent your stepfather. You've all been wronged so many times on so many levels by your mother who doesn't seem to think she's done anything wrong.

Be prepared for disappointment .", "It's amazing that mom can kidnap op, and dad still gets labelled as the bad guy. What delusion", "Giving an ultimatum like that to a 12 year-old? Remember he was happy to hear from OP until the adoption came up. OP having an adoptive dad shouldn't preclude a relationship with bio dad. Why did he decide it had to be one or the other? Does bio dad think he owns the kid or something? What the actual fuck. THAT'S an awful take.", "So your mother thought that your father would do something horrible by taking you from her. And she decided she was going to do it first. Your mother honestly sucks, she's one of the worst I've ever read about on this sub. I cannot cast a judgement on this because I do not know it you are willing to cut off one set of parents for the other. Because it's clear to me that they will never accept the other parents. Not even your stepdad could accept what your mother did and he almost left her. Why would your bio dad?", "Your parents have both handled things badly. Unless your mum had some compelling reason for taking you, what she did was undeniably incredibly fucked up. Mum was the asshole there, which surely goes without saying (unless there's some big dark secret that would explain her actions).\n\nBut your bio dad didn't cut contact with you when you were 12 because it was necessary for him to heal. He did it because it was easier for him. He couldn't put a 12 year-old's needs before his own. Effectively, he punished you, a child, for something your mum did.\n\nDo what you need to do, but please don't make his immaturity your emotional responsibility. If/when you write to him, say whatever you think is best. Just keep in mind that you shouldn't have to convince him of your innocence in this situation. You shouldn't have to apologise or even explain why you wanted to be adopted at 12. Of course that was hard for him to take but nothing about the situation was your fault and it's concerning that he couldn't recognise that.", "I would question why your mom felt like she had to runaway in the middle of the day.

But that doesn't change the fact that you were (and are) a kid and had no agency in the situation. What happened was between your mum and your dad and you don't have to torture yourself over what the right thing to do now is because it's literally not your fight. If you want to try again with your bio dad, you should. A letter won't kill him. He can say no if he wants. Please don't listen to people here saying YWBTA. You were a kid when you agreed to the adoption. Of course it hurt him but he should have understood that you didn't know that and it wasn't about him anyway. Yes, he got fucked over big time, but not by you.", "Ahh - ok. Thank you."]}
