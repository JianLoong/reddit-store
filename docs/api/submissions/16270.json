My wife (who gave birth to our son 6 weeks ago) also had her friend over to our house. So I finish up at the gym, head over there and sit down to play some games. After playing for about 30 minutes, my wife calls me (her friend is gone now) and asks if I can come home because a bump on her skin has gotten more painful and she doesn't want to be taking care of the baby alone when it's painful for her to stand and walk at this point (previously it only hurt while she was sitting). Obviously I'm disappointed that I have to leave but it is what it is. So I get up and tell my friend who gave me a ride over that I need him to give me a ride home. Everyone is confused and upset that I'm leaving, especially since now they're going to be short a person for their game. On the ride home I call my wife and suggest that I just bring my friends over to my house instead, that way I can help with the baby whenever she needs me to and I'll still get to hang out with my friends whenever I'm not needed by her. She says that she doesn't want people over, and we hang up. At this point I'm mad. After I get home I lay down next to her. 15 minutes of silence. She obviously doesn't need me at the moment. I finally ask myself out loud: \"what am I gonna do for the rest of day?\" She immediately starts crying and saying \"are you seriously mad right now?!\" I tell her yes. I'm not mad that she wanted me home, but I'm mad that she won't let me have my friends over when in my mind it makes no difference to her. They'll be out in the living room the whole time, it's not like she's going to be leaving the bedroom anyways, since it hurts for her to walk. She has no reason to in the first place when I'll be in the house and will be available at her beck and call. She says my priorities are all wrong. I tell her that she comes before my friends, but that I don't see why I cant be there for her when she needs help, and then also be able to go out into the living room to see my friends when she doesn't. That way we're both happy, right? She gets all the help she needs and my Saturday plans that ive been looking forward to all week aren't spoiled. She says I don't get it, that she needs moral support and I won't be able to provide that if my friends are over. I dont understand this, because i know for a fact that if I came home and just hung out playing games in the living room (when not actively helping her) that she would be fine with that. She even admitted this was true. After we argued she took an ibuprofen and felt no pain at all until the next day. \n\nPlease dont leave negative comments about my wife being a baby or anything. I'm not here to make her look bad or to bash her, I love and care about her a lot. I'm just need to know if I was being a jerk or not.", "created_utc": 1683078235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1366y82/aita_for_telling_my_wife_im_that_im_mad_that_she/", "score": 5781, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s sweet that you\u2019re worried about people making negative comments about your wife, but I\u2019d be more worried about people making negative comments towards you. \n\nFirstly, your wife has just given birth to your child, is likely still recuperating, is exhausted, and simply wanted her husband home to look after her and be there for her. I hate to break it to you, but once you get married and start a family, there is 0 room for \u201cbut what about MY plans?\u201d - if your partner says they need you, the conversation need not linger beyond \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d \n\nSecondly, your wife was COMPLETELY justified in not wanting your friends to come over when she wasn\u2019t feeling great. If I was in pain or unwell, I wouldn\u2019t particularly want to have my living room filled with a bunch of friends whilst I\u2019m stuck feeling awful. It\u2019s hard to relax in your own home when there are guests, even if you\u2019re not in the same room. I don\u2019t even have a child, but if my boyfriend asked me to come home because he wasn\u2019t feeling well, I wouldn\u2019t even THINK to ask if I could invite a bunch of friends over. Frankly, how you felt like this was a reasonable request is beyond me. \n\nMy advice? Stop being angry at your wife for wanting emotional support, and apologise for even making this into an issue.", "YTA and nobody is going to bash your wife or call her a baby cause the only person acting like a baby here is you and the only person who's bad and should be bashed here is you, your wife just had a baby and she wants some help but instead she has to fight you for it cause you would rather be playing \"games\" with your friends than taking care of your six week old child.

It is astounding that you are fine with spending hours away from your wife and newborn, knowing that your wife is likely still recovering from childbirth AND has another painful medical condition.

My wife (who gave birth to our son 6 weeks ago) also had her friend over to our house. So I finish up at the gym, head over there and sit down to play some games. After playing for about 30 minutes, my wife calls me (her friend is gone now) and asks if I can come home because a bump on her skin has gotten more painful and she doesn't want to be taking care of the baby alone when it's painful for her to stand and walk at this point (previously it only hurt while she was sitting). Obviously I'm disappointed that I have to leave but it is what it is. So I get up and tell my friend who gave me a ride over that I need him to give me a ride home. Everyone is confused and upset that I'm leaving, especially since now they're going to be short a person for their game. On the ride home I call my wife and suggest that I just bring my friends over to my house instead, that way I can help with the baby whenever she needs me to and I'll still get to hang out with my friends whenever I'm not needed by her. She says that she doesn't want people over, and we hang up. At this point I'm mad. After I get home I lay down next to her. 15 minutes of silence. She obviously doesn't need me at the moment. I finally ask myself out loud: \"what am I gonna do for the rest of day?\" She immediately starts crying and saying \"are you seriously mad right now?!\" I tell her yes. I'm not mad that she wanted me home, but I'm mad that she won't let me have my friends over when in my mind it makes no difference to her. They'll be out in the living room the whole time, it's not like she's going to be leaving the bedroom anyways, since it hurts for her to walk. She has no reason to in the first place when I'll be in the house and will be available at her beck and call. She says my priorities are all wrong. I tell her that she comes before my friends, but that I don't see why I cant be there for her when she needs help, and then also be able to go out into the living room to see my friends when she doesn't. That way we're both happy, right? She gets all the help she needs and my Saturday plans that ive been looking forward to all week aren't spoiled. She says I don't get it, that she needs moral support and I won't be able to provide that if my friends are over. I dont understand this, because i know for a fact that if I came home and just hung out playing games in the living room (when not actively helping her) that she would be fine with that. She even admitted this was true. After we argued she took an ibuprofen and felt no pain at all until the next day. \n\nPlease dont leave negative comments about my wife being a baby or anything. I'm not here to make her look bad or to bash her, I love and care about her a lot. I'm just need to know if I was being a jerk or not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So instead of allowing her to be a human who gets to see you, join the fun, eat, etc. she's basically relegated to the bedroom.

You just \"going to spend time in the other room\" and have fun while she can hear the laughter and jokes while she sits alone in the dark? WOW dude brutal. Also she's probably embarrassed at the state of her house, she's been socialized to be the hostess, she'd feel compelled to get up and welcome her guests, she wouldn't feel comfortable being 'gross' (e.g. lazing in pajamas, getting new ice packs, changing her bandages).

SEE ABOVE. (2) You don't understand how you being in the house is moral support? I mean remember when you were a kid (or kidder than now) and you could hear your family in other rooms and you were happy hanging out doing your own thing, but when your family was gone or the house was empty it seemed spookier and more intense to do things on your own? You don't think she feels safer with you there? So if she fell she can call for help? That you could be trusted (?) to at least make sure the baby doesn't flip over in its crib and die while she finally, finally showers. That hearing you puttering around being happy on your own may make her feel happy on her own? That you hanging out with your friends might make her feel excluded and lonely?

She has now felt she has tested your patience enough for one day, that you're going to be dismissive of her pain and feelings, and worries if she complains \"too much\" then you won't come home at all. *please understand that's not a normal thing.* How do I know? Ummm because ibuprofen doesn't even really get rid of a mild headache so much as dull it. So her pain just became more hideable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*This is what you should be doing:*\n\n* Making all her meals\n* Bottle feeding or bringing her the baby every 2 hours. Did you know that's how often babies need to eat? Because you being away hanging out makes it seem like you don't know that, or that babies can slam through 15 diaper changes a day. \n* Changing the baby. \n* Offering to watch the baby as she showers. Or, if she needs help in the shower, carrying the baby on a chest harness. \n* Helping her shower/go to the bathroom/change bandages/walk. She had MAJOR SURGERY. Even with a vaginal delivery her underside was stitched or stapled vagina to anus from the tearing. Let me just rip a fist sized opening under your sac and make you continue to do things. \n* Setting her up with a palatial spread of pillows on the bed or couch to prop her up for movie watching, easy access to water or other drinks, and a little snack, phone cord, etc. She should have EVERYTHING she wants in easy reach wherever she's sitting. The idea she needs to call for you except for baby is stupid. You need to act like you would if you were in a hospital bed what would you want (your switch, your cords, your headphones)\n* You need to be tracking her meds so you can make sure she doesn't get in too much pain between doses. Also, she may need to be taking some vitamins to help with hair loss, bone density, and other things that happen after the birth. (Did you know about that? Maybe you should read up!) \n* She is probably super sore still. Please offer to rub her muscles or get a massage gun. \n* Basically treat her like a queen. Bonus points for extra creativity, love notes, assurances that you're impressed with her, assurances you *actually like being around her*, that you love her, that she did an amazing job for 9 months, so you can cover these few weeks.\n\nI mean seriously, I hope you read this and step up.

Your wife isn't feeling great, she gave birth recently, her hormones are still likely all over the place, she probably feels a bit isolated even when she has a friend over, feels overwhelmed and stressed. \n\nSo, if a group of your friends come over, even if it requires your wife to do nothing at all, mentally it's still taxing. I bet, it will make her feel isolated more, overwhelmed too (because she'd likely second guess asking you for help with other's around). \n\nWhile yes, you could still help with the baby whenever needed. Your wife also needs you to just be with her. Y'all are together on this and just laying next to her in silence likely makes her feel less isolated, etc. \n\nFrom one post it seems like y'all are still pretty young. So, I doubt (but could be wrong) that you don't have a lot of parent friends.

He handled all the cleaning, diaper changes during the day/night, physical exertion, and was present and cocooning with me and our newborn. \n\nAdd to that the physical pain, the hormone dump, the sheer exhaustion (because I\u2019m gonna take a wild guess  that your wife is doing the majority of night wakes or you\u2019d have mentioned it), and the LAST thing any new mom wants as she\u2019s still  passing blood clots from her vagina, wearing pads, and trying to keep a newborn asleep, is a group of men in her home while she\u2019s needing emotional and physical support from her co-parent. \n\nGrow the fuck up, OP, and do better as a dad and husband.", "When I read that final bit I was hoping someone called him out on that LOL. OP is such an AH", "I just feel bad for OP\u2019s wife.

Why marry someone if you'd rather ditch them than be there to support them through an incredibly difficult experience. The lack of love or care is astounding. \n\nHe's a parent now. He's not going to have time to hang out with his bros the way he's used to for at least the next 15 years, and he should've realized that before the kid was even born. They're 6 weeks into this. If he wants to chill with his friends he can invite one over at a time to have company while he parents and takes care of the house.

What do you think she did that made her an ahole?", "\"It\u2019s about compromise sometimes for the sake of other person. You and your wife both need some breaks which will sometimes come at the expense of other person taking over childcare.\"\n\nSure, when the child is older and both parents are healthy. At 6 weeks postpartum, the mother is not only still recovering physically, which is challenging enough,  but the hormonal issues are at there absolute worst.  I have never felt more depressed, unbalanced, and anxious in my whole life as I did 6 weeks postpartum, and I suffer from chronic anxiety and depression. Physically, I was mostly recovered. Mentally, I was an absolute wreck.  It was one of the darkest times of my life. Now I did ultimately have true postpartum depression, but it might turn out OPs wife does too. Throw in an INCREDIBLY painful cyst that literally prevents her from walking, and I can only imagine the hell she's experiencing.  Plus, she's not actually getting a break the way OP tried to. She had a friend over, sure, but OP actually got out of the house, ALONE. No comparison between the 2 situations. \n\nAt some point OP will need a break, sure, but now is not the time. He has a responsibility to care for his child and sick wife (because a pilonidal cyst does mean she's sick).  This isn't about making both partners equally miserable.  This is about OP's wife NEEDING care. Both physical and emotional support. The reality is, while new parents do need breaks, they are often few and far between, and can be taken away on a moments notice. OP is certainly not the asshole for wanting a break, but he is the asshole for getting mad at his wife because she needed care. \n\nAs for shutting down him making plans in the first place, that's ridiculous.  She didn't know ahead of time she would need the level of care she ended up needing when he actually went gaming. Is OPs wife supposed to be able to predict the future and just know ahead of time when issues might arise? She obviously recognizes his need to get out with friends, which is why she didn't shut it down initially, but things change, sometimes last minute, ESPECIALLY with a newborn.  That's life and until the child is older, and really until the child is an adult, there are no guarantees that any plans OP or his wife make won't be derailed at the last minute.  That's the nature of parenthood.  Sure each parent should do what they can to make sure the other gets down time etc., but 6 weeks postpartum, when her body is still recovering, when emotionally she's likely at her worst, when she's also suffering from another medical issue, is not the time when OPs wife needs to suck it up for the sake of OP getting a break.", "Yeah, it\u2019s like he thinks the baby is an extension of his wife and not really his own problem.", "Yep.

Your wife is living on bare bones of sleep and you want to add a house full of guests to that? At the very least, I hope you were planning to order in for food but even so, who\u2019s gonna clean up after y\u2019all? Will you?

The first was already a father and refused to cross the threshold, he whisper yelled pleasantries through the front door and even though my husband insisted he could come in, he refused. The second was a guy whose wife was the only person allowed to come see me in the hospital\u2014I don\u2019t know why, we weren\u2019t especially close socially, but we kinda cut through the fat in terms of life events (I was the first outside person to know she was pregnant, by accident, I just happened to be around every time she was struggling with something) and she was due a few months after me. He stood in my entry hallway and laughed at a show I was watching, but wasn\u2019t willing to come in to the living room because he didn\u2019t know if I was accepting guests. I wasn\u2019t, I was pumping next to a sleeping baby, and I appreciated the gesture. \n\nAfter that my husband learned the rules. He can stand at the door and if I get invited in to see the baby or put food in the fridge or whatever, it\u2019s because there\u2019s probably some tired, undershowered mom with her tits out and a diaper on, and it\u2019s okay if I see it because a) vampire rules  and b) I\u2019ve lived it.", "Not to mention, have you ever heard a group of guys playing a game? It's noisy!

Even if he could hear, how often would he be willing to leave the game to \"help\", especially since he has, so far, shown less than no empathy for the poor woman?", "Can you imagine having a child with a man like this...........

For two years after my son was born, he took basically every opportunity he could to get out of the house and play board games or some other kind of games with his friends. When he was home he was playing video games. When he was taking care of the baby while I was trying to get a scrap of sleep (he got up with our son at night for like, maybe a month). He didn\u2019t help me feed the baby because i was breastfeeding and he couldn\u2019t fathom how he could help with that. He didn\u2019t put him to bed until he was two years old. I got to leave the house for my activities like three times in those two years and it usually got interrupted by a call telling me the baby was upset and wouldn\u2019t calm down and I needed to come home.\n\nThis shit about, \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t be upset if I were playing video games in the other room?\u201d Sounds like she\u2019s just conceding things to just stop arguing, because I remember how useless my husband felt to me, playing video games while I poured myself into taking care of our son. It felt like my old identity had totally died and been remade into nothing but a mother. And he was playing video games and carrying on and letting me handle the baby stuff on my own.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to ask for help, when you\u2019re a new mom. It\u2019s hard to admit you\u2019re in pain and miserable and can\u2019t do everything yourself because it\u2019s your baby and sometimes you feel like you should. I needed my husband to be watching my back and looking out for me, and he didn\u2019t. And the resentment that lasted from that has nearly ended our marriage three years later. I just\u2026 haven\u2019t been able to forgive him.\n\nDon\u2019t wait for her to ask for help, look out for her and make sure she\u2019s got what she needs, especially until things get easier. It takes a while, but you\u2019ll be able to get back to normal activities once things are more stable. It\u2019s just part of having a new baby.", "And he called it a bump on her skin.
