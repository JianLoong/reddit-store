My wife (who gave birth to our son 6 weeks ago) also had her friend over to our house. So I finish up at the gym, head over there and sit down to play some games. After playing for about 30 minutes, my wife calls me (her friend is gone now) and asks if I can come home because a bump on her skin has gotten more painful and she doesn't want to be taking care of the baby alone when it's painful for her to stand and walk at this point (previously it only hurt while she was sitting). Obviously I'm disappointed that I have to leave but it is what it is. So I get up and tell my friend who gave me a ride over that I need him to give me a ride home. Everyone is confused and upset that I'm leaving, especially since now they're going to be short a person for their game. On the ride home I call my wife and suggest that I just bring my friends over to my house instead, that way I can help with the baby whenever she needs me to and I'll still get to hang out with my friends whenever I'm not needed by her. She says that she doesn't want people over, and we hang up. At this point I'm mad. After I get home I lay down next to her. 15 minutes of silence. She obviously doesn't need me at the moment. I finally ask myself out loud: \"what am I gonna do for the rest of day?\" She immediately starts crying and saying \"are you seriously mad right now?!\" I tell her yes. I'm not mad that she wanted me home, but I'm mad that she won't let me have my friends over when in my mind it makes no difference to her. They'll be out in the living room the whole time, it's not like she's going to be leaving the bedroom anyways, since it hurts for her to walk. She has no reason to in the first place when I'll be in the house and will be available at her beck and call. She says my priorities are all wrong. I tell her that she comes before my friends, but that I don't see why I cant be there for her when she needs help, and then also be able to go out into the living room to see my friends when she doesn't. That way we're both happy, right? She gets all the help she needs and my Saturday plans that ive been looking forward to all week aren't spoiled. She says I don't get it, that she needs moral support and I won't be able to provide that if my friends are over. I dont understand this, because i know for a fact that if I came home and just hung out playing games in the living room (when not actively helping her) that she would be fine with that. She even admitted this was true. After we argued she took an ibuprofen and felt no pain at all until the next day. \n\nPlease dont leave negative comments about my wife being a baby or anything. I'm not here to make her look bad or to bash her, I love and care about her a lot. I'm just need to know if I was being a jerk or not.", "created_utc": 1683078235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1366y82/aita_for_telling_my_wife_im_that_im_mad_that_she/", "score": 351, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s sweet that you\u2019re worried about people making negative comments about your wife, but I\u2019d be more worried about people making negative comments towards you. \n\nFirstly, your wife has just given birth to your child, is likely still recuperating, is exhausted, and simply wanted her husband home to look after her and be there for her. I hate to break it to you, but once you get married and start a family, there is 0 room for \u201cbut what about MY plans?\u201d - if your partner says they need you, the conversation need not linger beyond \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d \n\nSecondly, your wife was COMPLETELY justified in not wanting your friends to come over when she wasn\u2019t feeling great. If I was in pain or unwell, I wouldn\u2019t particularly want to have my living room filled with a bunch of friends whilst I\u2019m stuck feeling awful. It\u2019s hard to relax in your own home when there are guests, even if you\u2019re not in the same room. I don\u2019t even have a child, but if my boyfriend asked me to come home because he wasn\u2019t feeling well, I wouldn\u2019t even THINK to ask if I could invite a bunch of friends over. Frankly, how you felt like this was a reasonable request is beyond me. \n\nMy advice? Stop being angry at your wife for wanting emotional support, and apologise for even making this into an issue.", "YTA and nobody is going to bash your wife or call her a baby cause the only person acting like a baby here is you and the only person who's bad and should be bashed here is you, your wife just had a baby and she wants some help but instead she has to fight you for it cause you would rather be playing \"games\" with your friends than taking care of your six week old child.

It is astounding that you are fine with spending hours away from your wife and newborn, knowing that your wife is likely still recovering from childbirth AND has another painful medical condition.

You want to bring a game night to the house while your wife is 6 weeks post partum and hurting, and feels unable to take care of her baby. The only people that will agree with you are childless people who have no idea. \n\nYTA.

My wife (who gave birth to our son 6 weeks ago) also had her friend over to our house. So I finish up at the gym, head over there and sit down to play some games. After playing for about 30 minutes, my wife calls me (her friend is gone now) and asks if I can come home because a bump on her skin has gotten more painful and she doesn't want to be taking care of the baby alone when it's painful for her to stand and walk at this point (previously it only hurt while she was sitting). Obviously I'm disappointed that I have to leave but it is what it is. So I get up and tell my friend who gave me a ride over that I need him to give me a ride home. Everyone is confused and upset that I'm leaving, especially since now they're going to be short a person for their game. On the ride home I call my wife and suggest that I just bring my friends over to my house instead, that way I can help with the baby whenever she needs me to and I'll still get to hang out with my friends whenever I'm not needed by her. She says that she doesn't want people over, and we hang up. At this point I'm mad. After I get home I lay down next to her. 15 minutes of silence. She obviously doesn't need me at the moment. I finally ask myself out loud: \"what am I gonna do for the rest of day?\" She immediately starts crying and saying \"are you seriously mad right now?!\" I tell her yes. I'm not mad that she wanted me home, but I'm mad that she won't let me have my friends over when in my mind it makes no difference to her. They'll be out in the living room the whole time, it's not like she's going to be leaving the bedroom anyways, since it hurts for her to walk. She has no reason to in the first place when I'll be in the house and will be available at her beck and call. She says my priorities are all wrong. I tell her that she comes before my friends, but that I don't see why I cant be there for her when she needs help, and then also be able to go out into the living room to see my friends when she doesn't. That way we're both happy, right? She gets all the help she needs and my Saturday plans that ive been looking forward to all week aren't spoiled. She says I don't get it, that she needs moral support and I won't be able to provide that if my friends are over. I dont understand this, because i know for a fact that if I came home and just hung out playing games in the living room (when not actively helping her) that she would be fine with that. She even admitted this was true. After we argued she took an ibuprofen and felt no pain at all until the next day. \n\nPlease dont leave negative comments about my wife being a baby or anything. I'm not here to make her look bad or to bash her, I love and care about her a lot. I'm just need to know if I was being a jerk or not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
