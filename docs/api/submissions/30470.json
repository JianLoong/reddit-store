If she doesn't see that and gets upset at you for setting reasonable boundaries when you're already doing so much for her, then she moves into AH territory.  \n\nBut if she's not generally an AH, your fears are probably misplaced.  She probably appreciates what you are doing for her, doesn't want to put any more on your plate if it makes you uncomfortable, and would respond to that guilt trip with \"well then I guess that's what it is\" rather than biting the hand that is already going above and beyond for her.", ">i just fear my sister thinks i\u2019m wrong for that if he plays the \u201cwell i can\u2019t see them then\u201d card.\n\n\u201cHe was given the option to see them and chose not to.\u201d", "agreed :)", "The weird excuse and insistence on going to your house is creepy too.

Best of luck and take care.", "completely agree", "Yeah you\u2019re right. She can be an AH from time to time as can we all. She gets that from her dad\ud83d\ude02.

If your sister asks, you can tell her the timing didn't work out, or something.  You're right, when she's in hospital you don't want to burden her with full details.", "NTA - it\u2019s just weird that he\u2019s so determined to meet in your house.", "Listen to your own feelings.  You can meet him at a park so the kids can play (you don't mention their ages).  If it's cold out, bundle them up.  Meet at a library perhaps?  If you can't think of a place, then have a friend be there while he's there.\n\nNever go against your instincts, women have them for a reason.", "That's er... worrying, to put it nicely. His insistence to go to your place means he's not willing to take no for an answer and is more than ready to take advantage of you in a non public space. You need to be clear and show him he's already crossed the line. \n\n\nI'd send that creep something alongside the following lines: \n\n\n\"Due to the [detail of his creepy/sexual behaviour] on [specific dates or events], and your past lack of respect for my boundaries, you're permanently banned from my house. This is not subject to change or to discussion. You're not welcome at my home on any given moment. \n\n\nDespite this, and in order to allow you to see your siblings while they're in Scotland, I am more than willing to meet at [date] in [public space with access to surveillance], from [time, preferably way before dark] to [time before dark].  \n\n\nIf you agree, let me know. I'll inform [sister] about this as well. Have a nice day.\"\n\n\nI'd do that in writing, so you have a backup for any given reason. Don't engage more than that, and if you do go, take someone along, both as witness and backup. He'll fight and say it's not like that. Don't engage. \n\n\nLet your sister know there's a reason for your not wanting him at your place, don't go into details, and let her know you will explain in depth when she's doing better. And that you're more than willing to accommodate by meeting at a public place of your choice. You're NTA, but would be if you cave in.", "NTA -- I understand why you don't want to worry your sister with this, but this doesn't extend to Luke. Tell him calmly that you don't feel comfortable with him in your house and you are willing to meet him in public or not at all.", "Parks are free.  NTA", "Nta you need to tell her that you\u2019re uncomfortable and tell him tough titties, he either meets you in public or not at all.", "I in general agree with the NTA and what everyone else is saying. AH for not telling your sister about him. She needs to know.", "NTA. In public, or not at all. There are plenty of free places to meet out in public.", "Nta. Do not allow him to come to your home.  Trust your gut... this is the type of situation that ends up on 20/20.", "Library is a free public place and often have meeting rooms", "No.\nIf you don't feel safe around him, then you don't need to let him In your house. Stick to your guns - you and the kids can meet him in a public place or not at all.\nI also think you should talk to your sister about how uncomfortable he makes you feel when she's feeling better.", "NTA. Be blunt with him, what is he going to do, run to his mommy? Good, then you can stop hiding it from your sister.", "NTA. He\u2019s creeping on you. You don\u2019t want to tell your sister, but what about her husband- the guys dad. Surely he should know how his son behaves. \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable or safe just don\u2019t arrange the meet up.", "NTA- A lot of victims say they felt something was off with the person but they didn't want to be rude and then it was too late. Don't become a victim.

Thanks :)", "I agree, i should have told her when it happened. However with him being her step son, who lives 300+ miles from her and rarely sees hee unless she\u2019s visiting, and with the fact i never see him, i didn\u2019t really think it mattered. Ovbiously now i see how that\u2019s dumb. Yeah, it will be public meet or nothing. Thanks :)", "Yeah! I plan to suggest one more time meeting in public, so to make it clear i\u2019ve given him the chance. If he says no again or that it must be indoors, then it\u2019s not happening.

Not going to happen.", "What about keeping your sister on a skype call while he's around so she's present and can hear him? If that won't work, find a voice recorder for your phone and keep it on when he's around you. You may need to play it for your sister some time in the future to justify anything that can come out of this visit. There are so many stories on here where a family member causes a lot of pain by spreading lies. Make sure you have witnesses or a recording. Also, you can safely turn your home into a public space. Have lots of friends be ready to be at your place at a specific time. Tell Luke to be there at that time and explain that you'll be away before that time so he won't be tempted to come early. NTA, keep yourself safe. Are there any youth hostels in your area? Maybe you can steer him to staying there if he tries to find an excuse to stay at your place. Make plans to take your niece and nephew someplace the day after Luke is there, preferably taking a small car so you can say sorry Luke there's no room for anyone else. Then you can safely and legitimately be gone and Luke will hopefully go back to where he belongs. Find a solution, whether it's a park, a museum, or your place, your priority should be your safety and that of your niece and nephew.", "The only way he would have my address is if my sister gave him it. I don\u2019t know if she has but i can easily ask. I don\u2019t think she would have though.", "I know England is a different country from Scotland. I just wasn't sure how long they had been without their mother and if any visits were planned. Another option is to find a fun activity in between you and the stepson for the kids, make a day of it. Like a Museum, zoo, or something like that. Something that could still be free, and invite him to join for that. If he says no then say a visit just won't work out until their mom is out of the hospital.", "I do understand why you didn\u2019t tell her initially! Definitely stick to a public place or nothing at all. Don\u2019t let him or anyone guilt or bully your into changing your mind either.  :)", "I would NOT give this man my address if I was OP", "The voice recorder won't protect her if he tries to sexually assault her. It might help her in court, but by then the damage is done.", ">You may need to play it for your sister some time in the future to justify anything that can come out of this visit.\n\nOkay, so\u2026while having a recording of any interaction is great and all, *YOU DO NOT NEED TO JUSTIFY A FUCKING THING TO FUCKING ANYONE! \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel safe or comfortable just don\u2019t meet up with him. So what your sister\u2019s in hospital, he can wait to see the kids when she gets out! \n\nAnd tell her soon that you don\u2019t feel comfortable around him and you can even leave it at that if you choose to without further elaboration. You do not have to justify shit! \n\nBut please, take care of yourself and advocate for yourself. Do not let him come over to your house or even say no to meeting up entirely. Be rude, whatever, do what you need to. You\u2019re worth it. NTA.", "Yeah i definitely will. Thanks :)", "I just want to insert here that in the worst case scenario where he just shows up at your house anyway, DO NOT under any circumstances, let him in.

Lock your door and tell him you'll call the police if he won't leave.", "You need to be direct and firm with him: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLuke, I have told you-repeatedly- I am not interested in you. I\u2019ve turned down every advance you\u2019ve made. Now, you have two choices. A. See your sisters at xx park at this time. B. Wait to see them when they return home. You are NOT entering my home in any circumstance. We can be civil to each other for the girls, but that is all. I don\u2019t want to bring this to (sister) and your (father\u2019s) attention, but if you persist, I will. Let me know your choice no later than (date here).   \n\n\nExpect him to be all blustery in his response. Oh, and keep *everything* by text; no conversation through phone.", "Definetly.
