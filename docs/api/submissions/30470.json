Luke can meet us in a public place if he wishes to see the girls.  Plenty of public places are free.  Or he can wait to see them until they are in your home again.  But these are his only two options.\"\n\nYou're not an AH for saying no.  You're not an AH for making that no firm.  Luke prefers your place BECAUSE he is a creep.  Parks, food courts, etc. are all free public places where people go to socialize.  He's making excuses because he WANTS to get you at home.  Stand firm.", "The park is free. NTA", "Keep those boundaries firm sister! NTA", "NTA  \nYou\u2019re wise to have these boundaries.  \nYour decision to keep Luke out of your house is protecting his step-siblings from witnessing his unacceptable behaviour.  \nMaintain your strong stance and just tell your sister that Luke makes you uncomfortable at times.", "NTA do whatever makes you feel safe.", "NTA.\n\nSafety first. Don't let the discomfort walk through the door of your home.", "Why would you want to spend time with someone you know is a sexual predator?  NTA x 100...", "NTA. His behavior is creepy and you need to protect yourself which mean public meetings only with this guy. Don't cave on this. Always listen to your gut because being polite and nice doesn't apply to creepy creepers.", "NTA. Do not invite someone who behaves like a creep into your home (don't even give the address). Meet at a park. It's free. He can play with the kids. That's the point of his visit, no? But honestly, I'd try to avoid the meeting at all. He can wait until your sister is out of the hospital to see the kids.", " Definitely do NOT let this man know where you live or allow him into your home.  \n\nDo you have a large male friend that can join you at the park as well? Maybe a friend\u2019s husband or boyfriend.  Someone you trust.", "NTA- your house is your safe space. Don\u2019t invite a creep in. There are plenty of free places to meet. If he can\u2019t meet at a park, then will miss out. No discussion and no excuses.", "NTA. Tell him that the only way you will be able to meet him is at the location you stated.  If he is not able to meet you there, unfortunately he won't be able to see the kids.\n\nyou need to tell your sister what he has done.  Yes, she is ill but as soon as possible, she needs to know how inappropriate you feel his behavior has been.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He doesn\u2019t need money to meet in a public place, go to a bench in the park! Don\u2019t let him into your home, your safety comes first and this is something you should definitely talk with your sister. Tell him it is either where you say or no meeting at all.", "NTA. If he doesn't already know where you live, keep it that way. And if you do agree to meet him anywhere, I'd strongly suggest taking an intimidating male friend or mom/aunty who will give him a tongue lashing if he gets out of line.", "NTA. Are your niece and nephew able to visit their mom? If so just set it up so he can visit with them around the time they visit their mom.", "NTA\n\"I'm sorry, my home is not an option right now. Let's find some low-cost activity or place to go, and food is on me\"\n\nYou do not need to explain further.

He\u2019s just full of excuses.", "If he's that creepy I hope he doesn't have her address..... and then he just shows up.", "Oh i completely agree. It would cost him no more getting to my house than a park. In fact it may even cost less as we could meet in the middle. He won\u2019t be in my house regardless, i just fear my sister thinks i\u2019m wrong for that if he plays the \u201cwell i can\u2019t see them then\u201d card.", "This and keep another adult witness with you while he is present, even in a public place.", "THANK YOU, THAT\u2019S LITERALLY WHAT I SAID!! he\u2019s just making excuses\ud83d\ude16", "I will! Thank you", "I agree.. I\u2019ll maybe mention to her tomorrow if she\u2019s up for talking, which she hasn\u2019t really been these past few days. Regardless he won\u2019t be coming in my home. Thank you!", "I will. Thank you.", "I won\u2019t. Thanks!", "I don\u2019t that\u2019s the whole point\ud83d\ude02but i\u2019m currently caring for his brother and sister and with me not being their legal guardian i technically can\u2019t stop him seeing them.", "Thank you!

As i say, i\u2019m up in Scotland with them, and Luke also lives in Scotland, so he only sees them when they visit but it\u2019s usually my sister taking them and she won\u2019t be coming up here after she\u2019s discharged. So it\u2019s me taking them or they don\u2019t see him at all. However he won\u2019t be in my home, especially now i\u2019m reassured i\u2019m not in the wrong for saying no. Thanks :)", "Yes! My friends going to come with me :)", "I agree. Thank you!", "I agree, thanks :)", "i\u2019m sorry to hear that :( i\u2019m definetly sticking to my guns!", "Yes absolutely. I wouldn\u2019t be going alone regardless :)", "will do! thanks :)", "I agree. Thank you!", "He doesn\u2019t know where i live, unless my sister has told\nhim. I\u2019m gonna take a male friend. Thanks :)", "No. There mum is in a different country within the uk and it\u2019s over 300+ miles away and a 6 hour drive. They won\u2019t see their mum until she\u2019s out the hospital and i take them home :)", "I totally agree with everything you said, apart from the fact that the food definetly is not on me. I\u2019m not paying for a perverts food.", "And that\u2019s why you need to shut him right down. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I was thinking of someplace free. Let\u2019s meet at X Park.\u201d", "You're doing your sister a COLOSSAL favor by taking her kids in during this time.  If she doesn't see that and gets upset at you for setting reasonable boundaries when you're already doing so much for her, then she moves into AH territory.  \n\nBut if she's not generally an AH, your fears are probably misplaced.  She probably appreciates what you are doing for her, doesn't want to put any more on your plate if it makes you uncomfortable, and would respond to that guilt trip with \"well then I guess that's what it is\" rather than biting the hand that is already going above and beyond for her.", ">i just fear my sister thinks i\u2019m wrong for that if he plays the \u201cwell i can\u2019t see them then\u201d card.\n\n\u201cHe was given the option to see them and chose not to.\u201d", "agreed :)", "The weird excuse and insistence on going to your house is creepy too. Evidence that you made a good call in the first place.", "Honestly I can\u2019t think of many places that you have to pay to enter. Maybe he can\u2019t afford lunch, but he can still sit in a cafe.", "Sure you can. If his parents want him to be able to see his step sibs, they will have to take the children elsewhere. Not in your home. You have full power over that. No technicalities about it!", "Maybe your sister has a (male) friend she could ask to get all the kids together, so you're not involved? \n\nI hope she's better soon!", "Nothing wrong with having and enforcing boundaries! Best of luck and take care.", "completely agree", "Yeah you\u2019re right. She can be an AH from time to time as can we all. She gets that from her dad\ud83d\ude02. However i agree, if she has a problem with me not wanting Luke in my house that\u2019s her issue, not mine!", "Completely right. I just know how twisted he can be.", "Oh absolutely. I might hate saying no to people but i\u2019m not stupid and i know exactly what he\u2019s trying to do. Thanks :)", "Totally agree.", "Yeah you\u2019re right. I\u2019m just a push over and hate saying no to people\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fbut everyone is right, my safety is more important than the fear of looking bad to my family!", "Yeah i\u2019ll suggest that to her! \n\nThank you :)"]}
