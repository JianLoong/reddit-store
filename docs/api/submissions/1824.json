A low probability hazard which has a potentially catastrophic outcome is still a high risk.\n\nType I: dude gets offended (which to be fair is understandable).\n\nType II: we could be beaten up, raped and/or murdered.\n\nNow, we also live in a society where we constantly and relentlessly receive the message that \u2014 if we are victims of a violent assault \u2014 this is because we either did something to encourage it (eg \u201cwhat was she wearing?\u201d) or didn\u2019t take sufficient precautions to avoid it (eg. \u201cwhy did she take that poorly lit shortcut? Why did she let that guy [who assaulted her] walk her home? Or why did she walk home alone?\u201d).\n\nWe carry that with us.
