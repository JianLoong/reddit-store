In that case, could the nephew not rent a room in the house above the basement if it is self contained? Or is there something precluding that.\n\nIt its just three females in your basement where they share your kitchen and the access to the basement is through your house - that woudnt be \"female only house\" as your argument falls apart as, you know, you are not female.
