Acknowledge your error to your husband and to your stepdaughter. Apologize sincerely.  Tell them it was grief that made you react without thinking and that you would like a chance to make it right.

But at the end of the day you would have been doing everyone a favor by dumping this on his lap. As for your mom of course she is your priority at this time. I hope your husband will look at this realistically and give you some grace. Not your fault daughter didn\u2019t call her dad directly.", "YTA for not even clueing him in to what was going on. He had a possibility to reconnect with his child and you determined your priorities must also be his and disrespected him by not even allowing him a say in things.", "YTA. You made decision for you and completely ignored your husband. What other things do you not communicate with him about?", "NTA. This is an incredibly stressful time for you and not the time for long lost relatives to reappear. You have no emotional space for this right now. You also offered her an alternative- right after Christmas. It's not your job to repair this relationship; it's your husband's, because he is her father. Why has he not reached out all these years to repair the relationship? You aren't the AH, and your husband absolutely is. He should be supporting you right now, not dragging you into his family drama while you're going through your own. \n\nI'm sorry for your mother. I hope the time you have left with her is peaceful.", "YTA.  You didn't bother to include your husband in this decision???  What is wrong with you.  I'm surprised he didn't bail on visiting your family, and keep your kids home to meet their sister.  You really suck.", "YTA. Go visit your mother by yourself. I hope your husband throws you under the bus to reconnect with his daughter. I would.", "YTA.  Your mother is an adult and can deal with the presence of Nina. You and your husband did a piss poor job managing a difficult situation when Nina was a child and you are now denying Nina and her child a Christmas visit because your mom is an AH and that makes you an AH, too.", "Soft NTA. You didn't want someone who has been very disruptive to your life ruining what will likely be your last visit with your mother. You should have told her dad though.", "YTA", "YTA", "#YTA", "YTA.", "YTA you didn't even discuss it with your husband first. Just wrong.", "YTA. Instead of having any degree of empathy for a child who\u2019s own mother cut her out of her life, you blamed her for acting out, which was a completely understandable response for her. You have been callous, and frankly irresponsible, towards your stepdaughter, which is not a reasonable reaction to what she went through. On top of that, you disrespected your partner by not including him in a decision that was his to make. You, an adult, acted out of spite and hurt your family.\n\nIt\u2019s abundantly clear you simply do not like her and you\u2019re manipulating all involved in order to keep her out of the family. You owe everyone an apology, and perhaps you should try putting yourself in her shoes, rather than being vindictive.", "Not to mention that she thought you were a safe place after being hurt in ways you can't imagine.   Good job making sure her trust issues continue.  I hope you realize how much you've hurt her for life but im sure that's not important to you after all it was everyone else's fault.", "yta", "YTA", "I am sorry your mum is ill.", "YTA for making a decision without speaking with your husband. Wondering if you would feel the same way if it was your own child. If you would then I feel sorry for your kids. If I was your husband I would be looking at you with a side eye from now on.", "YTA, it could be anyone\u2019s last Christmas. People should spend Christmas with their loved ones if they are able.", "YTA \n\nShe may be an adult but her relationship with her father hasn\u2019t been healed and you\u2019ve disrupted that process without consulting him. You were a conduit and you created a greater rift. \n\nAlso, none of us knows how long we have left on earth. You cannot say with certainty that your stepdaughter has many more christmases left. You don\u2019t know that, you can\u2019t predict it. Hopefully it\u2019s true, but you do not know that", "So, you met this child when she was 9, and she'd just been abandoned by her mother and unwillingly taken in by your husband. Which she knew. Then you showed up, and your husband started to move on, but didn't bother to make sure the two of you bonded before marrying you.\n\nYou took a traumatized child, further traumatized her,  didn't get her in therapy, and then blamed her for acting like traumatized children do. Instead of trying to love her better and do right by her, you shipped her off to another family member and blamed her for it. \n\nAnd then, when she actually tried to initiate contact, you refused her. \n\nDo this poor baby a favor and STAY THE FUCK OUT OF HER LIFE. There is only further misery to be found if she knocks again at your cold, dark door. YTA", "YTA\n\nThat should have been a joint discussion and decision with your husband. You should have consulted him before you said a word to her. There night have been other options, such as him meeting her elsewhere for a while on his own. Now she thinks the 'no' was from both of you.", "You\u2019re asking the wrong question\u2026per the comments others are leaving it seems you should be considering: are you TA for not discussing the message received with your husband/family. \n\nSo as it stands, yes, YTA.", "Why didn't you visit your mom and let your husband do whatever he wanted?\nYou are independent adults. You are not attached at the hip. Wasn't your call to make. YTA", "YTA please try to fix this", "Not everyday is guaranteed for anyone. So to say she has next year isn\u2019t always true. Should\u2019ve let her visit. Maybe kept it separate from your mom.", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't discuss this with your husband. You made the decision for you both without considering his wishes. He may have had failings as a parent (it sounds like you both did is she was acting out and the decision was to send her away versus finding out the root cause and working on it together) but he deserves a chance to grow and be better with his daughter if that's what they want. You should have left on your own to see your Mother if you didn't want her tagging along. Instead you selfishly stripped them both of a shared holiday so that you could be comfortably surrounded by your loved ones. \n\nYou all need therapy from the sound of it and I mean that respectfully.", "Yta. That wasn't your decision to solely make and didn't communicate with your husband. He could have spent some time at home with his daughter and grandchild and you possibly could have just ruined that for him.", "YTA. The fact that this is possibly your mother\u2019s last Christmas and Nina\u2019s first attempt in 5 years makes it all the more important. Yes, Nina potentially has many more holidays ahead of her but, you\u2019ve made a decision that may push her to decide to spend none of them with her father and you in the future. Your mother is stuck in her ways and will seemingly die that way but, you\u2019ve adopted her ways as your own by continuing to alienate Nina because of your Mom\u2019s opinions. Furthermore, it was your husband\u2019s call and you did not even discuss it with him before shooting Nina down. So now, instead of regaining a daughter you are losing both your mother and her.", "Simply put... yes, you were wrong. It's not your place to answer that question especially without talking to your husband. How would you like it if someone called up your kid and told them they weren't welcomed for Christmas? You'll be lucky if she comes back to visit for awhile. You're husband's right about the bond though... its never too late. My SS is 18 and we've had him with us for awhile, he put us through hell.he'll.. my family doesn't like him but last Christmas or not.. I would never tell him he couldn't come. That was selfish of you IMO and it'd be very quiet in my house for at least  a few days until I could figure out nicely how to talk to you.", "My god, I assumed they had different moms. I didn't realize her mom effectively kept one sibling and abandoned the other. That is one of the awful things I've ever heard of someone doing.", "it\u2019s not even going no contact. she was six years old - she abandoned her.", "One child acted out, while the other didn't. I think the \"why\" is painfully obvious. My heart hurts for her. I cant imagine how traumatic it would be to get rejected by your own mom at the age of 6.", "She wouldn\u2019t have her during custody time and instead of doing anything about it we just kept Nina and only had Adam 50/50", "> How would you feel if you and your husband divorced and his new wife/gf told one of your kids that they couldn\u2019t visits their dad? \n\nprobably happy, because she gets more time with her kids.", "Imagine if the husband had made a decision like this without consulting, if the roles were reversed.", "No question that the OP is TA, but her mom should not have to host people in her house that she doesn\u2019t like. Regardless of the reason.", "Adam is the son", "She didn\u2019t reach out to her dad, is what I meant. She did reach out to Adam.", "I love your comment, especially the part about coming between the husband and his daughter. I'll never understand this. Why can't people put themselves in someone else's position for two seconds and figure out what the right thing to do is. What kind of mother would inflict harm on someone else's parent/child relationship\u2014especially someone they're supposed to love (her husband)? How would *she* like it if someone tried to do that to her and *her* kids?", "I can't help but wonder if her plan was to purposely come between them.", "All of this!! I agree OP is TA. I bet Nina and their grandchild are absolutely devastated to be thrown out like trash at xmas time when they have basically been told they are not welcome home at xmas. This post should be nominated for AH of the year.", "For real, the purposeful ignorance here is astounding.\n\nOP is clearly intent on them not having a relationship ever. Major YTA behavior.\n\nSounds like this poor girl has had an incredibly rough life, and OP has zero sympathy  or awareness.", "There's never too little room for any information that makes OP rationalize completely shutting-out a person (without even consulting their father) who has had an extremely fraught upbringing that they had a hand in shaping.\n\nAs a step-parent, the callousness is disturbing and OP should be ashamed of themselves.", "We have a very good relationship with Adam.", "YTA! I so agree! Being as though she felt the need to say she encouraged therapy and sent money.  And honestly none of us know how long we have to live so we cherish time spent together. So that\u2019s not a great excuse. It should have been discussed with her father.", "I don't understand how this woman that you refer to as a lady could do something like this, being a mother herself. Why can't people think how others would feel in the same situation for two seconds? If they did, there would be no question about what the right thing to do is. I wonder how OP would like it if someone interfered with her parent/child relationship like this\n\nNote: I know you were being facetious when you use the word lady, haha. It's dripping with sarcasm", "What she has isn\u2019t contagious, we\u2019re spending the school break with her and are going home when our 9 year old is due to start school again", "Best description of events yet. OP could take her youngest kids to go see their grandma and let dad go see his oldest daughter.\n\nBut there's also a part of me that thinks there's an issue with it being a Christmas thing. Why is after Christmas a non starter? Why doesn't the daughter want to see her dad even if it's after Christmas? That's her dad, why wouldn't they link up anyway?", "She'll still have one last Christmas with her mum whether Nina is there or not, but she doesn't have a right to tell Nina she can't visit her own father because a bigoted old woman is still mad at her for being troubled as a child.", "This is not a decision you make unilaterally. Nina visiting her father does not require OP to not visit their mother. If that were my child that I clearly wanted reconciliation with, I would have told OP to go see their mum while I saw my kid. If OP had never even given me the option, and just decided for me instead, we would be discussing why I shouldn't divorce OP as I packed to go see my kid. Clearly that reconciliation means just as much to him as OPs mother does to them. \n\nIt's horrifically ironic how OP threw everyone else's parent/child relationship under the bus in the interest of their relationship with their parent, and what they're not acknowledging is that this may have been their husband's last chance at his parent/child relationship, too.\n\nYTA, OP.", "The op said her mom probably wasn't going to make it. So her sickness is fatal.", "My husbands 47 and I\u2019m 41", "Right???? How was this allowed??", "Is there a reason you will divulge?", "Jesus.  That poor kid.", "But why not just have both of the kids 100% of the time? Being abandoned by a parent is awful enough. Having to watch your sibling be very much not abandoned would be the ultimate mindfuck.", "How old was she when she started therapy?

No wonder she acted out. \n\nYTA, by the way.", "If someone feels happy about their child being rejected by their own parent so they have \u201cmore time\u201d then they don\u2019t deserve their kids as much as the parent who rejects them.", "Agreed, and three stepdaughter also shouldn't be subjected to that at Christmas. I was thinking more that OP should change plans to include visiting her mom before or after Christmas with the family. Since the mom is the one with the issue, why would she be the priority?", "She was probably scared/intimidated/ashamed and wanted to go through Adam so he could test the waters. If your husband, Nina's father wants it, who are you to say no?", "If one child was abandoned by her mother, and the other child wasn't, which would you expect to be \"easier\" to raise?", "[removed]", "I\u2019m sure you do, he was probably easier for you to control and manipulate, being that he\u2019s younger.

I still think you should have told your husband and found time to visit with her, but no. You weren't wrong to not invite Nina to your mom's if that's indeed what was happening", "I actually wasn't thinking about contagion (odd in these plague times), I was thinking of it being stressful on her to host. \n\nBut either way, this was for your husband to be the one communicating.", "Yta\n\nCut your visit short.
