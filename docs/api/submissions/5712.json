My relationship with my mother was fine until I was around 9 when trauma had me acting out.  I didn't steal like Nina did but I certainly fought with my mother and held her in contempt until I was in my early-mid 20's.\n\nShe let me move out when I was 16, which I think helped a lot.  And was super supportive of me when a relationship turned sour.  She was the one I leaned on, and the one who helped me land on my feet again when I needed the help.\n\nAt 30 I have a much better relationship with her.  And yeah there's a few bumps here and there but isn't there always when you live with someone?\n\nThat wouldn't have happened though if someone told me \"no\" when I reached out to reconcile.

It would seem that if you had primary custody and one parent took and saw one child and didn\u2019t the other, you could go back to court and demand supervised visitation or something?

Good on you u/klassictuck for letting your kids know that they didn\u2019t grow in your belly. \n\nI do think at their ages they are old enough to be told that mommy wasn\u2019t well enough to look after them and to explain that people\u2019s brains can be sick or injured just like the rest of people\u2019s bodies, but that they are exactly where they belong and are so loved. I highly recommend children\u2019s books as a helpful tool for age appropriate messaging and normalizing the circumstances. These days there are books for children on so many difficult topics - from divorce, to addiction, parent incarceration, death - you name it. Reading them together repeatedly and reflecting can be a great comfort for kids and also a huge relief for adults who are struggling to find child appropriate language for complex topics. \n\nI say this because 6 and 8 yos are old enough to be curious about the \u201cwhy\u201d of it all, and children tend to take on fault when they don\u2019t have any semblance of an outside explanation. We often fill in the gaps in the story with whatever proves our biggest insecurities. Providing them a loving home is of course the greatest thing, but it won\u2019t eliminate those questions in their mind. It\u2019s best to provide them with a gentle version of the reality than to leave their minds to fill in the gaps and potentially internalize a sense of rejection that effects their self esteem. We so often look at topics like these in terms of whether the child can understand, when it is also a matter of the adult having the tools to shape the message. A child will trust you to tell them things when it\u2019s the right time if they feel a sense of respect and communication.  \n\nU/klassictuck this comment isn\u2019t all directed at you\u2026I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got it down and I know you didn\u2019t ask for advice.

But he's working at a sandwich shop and is doing so well there and wants to move up to run the joint. It's good to see him have goals.

She didn't even reach out to her own father. She reached out to her brother and her brother is the one who decided to pass the message on to you about her idea of wanting to visit.

You have zero right to invite anyone over to someone else's home who has already expressed they do not like the person, and especially one who's dying and would probably find the entire ordeal more stressful.

And telling hubby that you want him to see daughter, but you need him, too. Communication could have helped a lot I think. It's not too late I think.

OP's mom, who is hosting, probably wouldn't have welcomed the daughter.

Let\u2019s hope both of them recognize this is the stepmother\u2019s hand, and not their father\u2019s.", "Either way, it was not OP's place to make the decision, the outcome might've very well be the same, but OP took away the father's agency by responding before informing him.", "Well, you see there is a thing, when your mother abandons you then your father and his wife ships you off to someone else its hard to trust them, you love them because they are your family but you are scared of how little they actually love you since they clearly wanted to get rid of you...\n\nThey didn't receive any messages from her for all them years cause they abandoned her, and I bet she never received any from them.\n\nEven then that's not why it's on OP, despite all that nastiness, it's on OP because she took her husbands choice, went behind his back and told this girl who had basically just talked to her brother about wishing to see them (who her birth mother had wanted to keep around and not her btw) that she couldn't see them on Christmas.\n\nThis girl who they ABANDONED confided on how she wished she could see them to her brother, she likely thought they never wanted to see her, and her brother went to OP and basically went hey heres a little hint that could cheer up my sister and prove you guys do love her and instead she made sure to let her know how unwelcome she is.\n\nI really hope you can understand now, because what is happening is beyond cruel and honestly just messed up, as someone who has come from an abusive family dynamic my heart breaks for this girl because of how  bad she has it.", "Yeah, she didn't text them, so why tf was OP contacting her at all ? OP seems to have heard rumors of a text and then told the daughter to fuck off first, ya know, just in case \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab", "Wait. Everyone is missing.  Nina messaged Adam she might want to do this.  Adam told OP.\n\nOP messaged Nina and said don\u2019t come we don\u2019t want you.", "The brother contacted as Nina's proxy.", "The husband wasnt informed first because he\u2019s just an inconvenient sperm donor she hasn\u2019t gotten rid of yet", "I think you\u2019re missing a few days there", "Consider this\u2026.Nina may not have known about the OPs mother.  She simply mentioned to her brother that she might want to visit.\n\nOP chose to call her or text her or something and say don\u2019t bother we dont want you.\n\nIt\u2019s not like this girl knows the woman is dying so let\u2019s see how much more drama she can cause.", "Ya all not relizing that op is watching hee mother die before her eyes? Can ya point me to anyone who would be thinking right while watching your loved one die?", "Wait.  Stop we don\u2019t know that Nina even knew the old hag was sick?\n\nWhy assume she\u2019s doing something evil?", "Wait. Everyone is missing. Nina messaged Adam she might want to do this. Adam told OP.\n\nOP messaged Nina and said don\u2019t come we don\u2019t want you.", "He was so distraught by the fact he gave away care of his child to his parents because he couldn't be stuffed anymore he forgot how to communicate", "My mom did it with me essentially \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Omg it lines up perfectly with the other kid being 18...he probably went to college and OP pushed for the 13 yo to go to gma", "She did offer to see all of them days after Christmas- maybe they have plane tickets, other sunk costs to see dying mom?  She could have handled it better- but grief is hard, and we are not great at thinking of others when we are in the middle of it. Dad could also reach out and ask for that immediately after we get back time, literally days later than original request?  IDK how this is such a bad thing- but my family is not all uptight about celebrating exact days- we often had to be flexible to be together and work around limited PTO, etc as we all got older.", "She didn't even reach out to her dad.  I'm confused by this. I personally don't think Christmas day is the day to reconcile. She said she could visit after Christmas.  I gave my teenage son the choice of Christmas day with me or his dad. He chose his dad's because he gets to see all of his cousins. We will celebrate this week.", "I believe that Nina was probably nervous reaching out to their parents and decided to talk to her brother first because it felt lower stakes and the brother likely informed OP assuming OP would also tell his father.", "Wait. Everyone is missing. Nina messaged Adam she might want to do this. Adam told OP.\n\nOP messaged Nina and said don\u2019t come we don\u2019t want you.", "Especially when the plans seem to have already been made. Everyone is glossing over that!", "Uhm she was sent away years ago. I wonder why she's hesitant to contact OP or her father now \ud83e\udd14. What a mystery. \n\nYou people are ridiculous. She was up to something, really? Maybe she just wanted her brother to get a feel for how OP and dad would react.", "This is it. It really doesn\u2019t matter who Nina reached out to and when. The issue is that OP made a decision about the situation without consulting her husband first. That was wrong. Period.", "As someone who was abandoned by both parents, you really don't, not completely. I'm 35 and I'll be struggling with the effects for the rest of my life. \n\nIf my mother hadn't been culturally pressured into having children, the last few decades of suffering could have been prevented entirely. \n\nLord help post-Roe America.", "And Nina's child is literally OP's husband's granddaughter. \n\nLike tell us you're Lady Tremain without saying it directly.", "Huh?  Is the step daughter supposed to be ill?  Otherwise, it is normal to assume that a *daughter* will have many more years than the stepmother\u2019s mother,", "Not everyone goes around assuming that even the young may die tomorrow.  OP\u2019s assumption was understandable.  Her making a decision based on the assumption without telling her husband, when the matter primarily concerned him was inexcusable.", "That\u2019s what got me. Acting out for attention? Uh yeah everyone who was supposed to love and protect Nina abandoned her.", "It's her mother. She made the decision on behalf of herself and her mother. She could have contacted her own father. If she was so grown up and wonderful she could have organised her own holidays.", "They seem to be aware that they were made in another woman's tummy and given to their mommy, just not that their birth mother abandoned them.", "As someone who JUST lost their mother today (technically, actually we feel she left us yesterday as that's when it's believed her brain stem died and when we saw everything slip away), you never know when someone will be gone. We didn't see this coming. OP, YTA. But you got what you secretly wanted, and don't have to deal with the \"other\" kid. Shame on you.", "Thank you for being one of the only reasonable people in this whole comment section. I\u2019ve been going nuts reading all these deranged idiots project their issues onto OP.", "Good post. Sometimes I think I'm going crazy reading these, everyone calling OP an asshole and I just don't see it. If dad is such a poor misunderstood guy getting screwed over , why isn't daughter reaching out to him directly? Why does OP have to ruin what is likely her mother's last Christmas? Stepdaughter can't  wait a day? Dad can't make his own plans?  Get real, my family is all over the place during the holidays with firefighters that work on Xmas , others with newborns and new obligations with new in laws. This situation seems like a big nothing burger to me", "That's more common than many people realize- preparing for one death & someone else passes first.\n\nI've been listening to some narcissist issues podcasts & the \"this might be the last year...\"; I'm around, your relative will be around, etc. is a very well worn manipulation tactic. \n\nOP even if you were 100% in the right about all the supporting details and your mom passes in the next 3 months, you were still entirely TA.\n\nYou hijacked your husband's choice by pretending that since his daughter only said it to her brother that it wasn't a legitimate attempt on her part to reconnect w her dad.\n\nYou want to turn it into a GIGANTIC win?\n\nReach out to her yourself . Offer a sincere direct apology  - stay only in the now (you can't say anything about past behavior or events). \n\nTell her that in your fear for your mother you ignored your stepdaughter's  emotional wants and needs which are equally as valid.\n\n\"I'm sincerely sorry. I acted in self defense when what you deserved was compassion. I have a lot to work on. I want to be a person that facilitates your relationships in our family.\"\n\nNo excuses, no justifictions, nothing about what you do for your kids/relatives.\n\nShe was his daughter, and they were family BEFORE you existed.

So sorry for your losses", "I'm the daughter of a murdered mother and I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nI hope your family is doing ok xxxx\n\nEDIT: added last part", "I'm so sorry. Sending love. All the love.", "So sorry", "And the only answer is for her husband to accompany her to her mother\u2019s deathbed. She can never go alone so her husband can see his estranged daughter who is reaching out.", "This comment right here.\n\nShe floated the idea by the person who she knew wouldn't reject/hurt her. Her brother.\n\nIn strained family relationships it's common to communicate indirectly first.\n\nShe asked her brother what he thought, and I'm sure she either asked him directly or heavily implied she'd like to participate in Christmas this year.\n\nHe thought it over and decided that it was probably safe to ask his stepmom if his sister could participate, most likely anticipating that the stepmom would then bring it up with the father. \n\nI'm also willing to bet that the brother thought it would be a yes from dad.", "Kids can handle surprisingly difficult stuff, and often rather casually. I have a little guy in my program who was adopted from foster care, and he once casually mentioned that he used to live with his other mommy but \"she didn't make safe choices\" so he and his brother couldn't live there any more.", "Oh, you mean telling the kids that the older child sees the biological mother?  I thought you meant telling them that they had been abandoned.\n\nI sort of assumed that if the kids asked about the \u201cfirst mother\u201d they would be told who she was and how she just didn\u2019t feel she could take care of them so she gave them to their \u201cnow mother.\u201d  I agree, it would be strange not to tell them.", "I'm sorry about your cousin. My mum suffered the same fate and it's hard. \nI hope your family is doing ok xx", "I am so.sorry for your family's loss. My deepest condolences xx"]}
