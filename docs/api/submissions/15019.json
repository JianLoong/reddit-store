He probably didn't realize you were keeping tally of the number of fries being eaten to ensure a 50/50 split.\n\nHe gave you an apology; just because you claim it's not good enough for you doesn't mean it's not an apology. Yeah, you're such a victim because he didn't get on his hands and knees to grovel for your forgiveness over his blasphemous act of eating a couple too many fries out of the bag.\n\nThis whole thing is so petty but you're the one making it into a bigger deal than it is.", "ESH but from your comments you suck more. He shouldn't have eaten all the fries. It's not hard to take a second to consider how many to eat. That's where his failings stop (for this incident). He apologized and offered an explanation but he still apologized. By your own admission you 1) tried to keep it light a joking (meaning you muddled the communication and your real feelings making him feel like it wasn't a serious issue for you), 2) wouldn't let it go (forcing him to constantly apologize and go on the defensive because you're coming at him like an attack - which is what you DON'T want) and 3) consistently beat him down and made him feel shame and guilt about fries when you KNOW that it's going to make him defensive (which is what you DON'T want). YOU are actively working against YOURSELF and then blaming HIM for it.", "YTA\n\nGet another order of fries and stop playing games", "ESH  It's fries.

Just don\u2019t split fries again - it never works out.

Continuing to push after the initial apology indicates you were trying to blow this up into a bigger fight. \n\nAlso I hate the whole \"I'm not that hungry, I'll have some of your's, okay?\" You can order a small, man.", "Between a) telling him you weren\u2019t really hungry and b) ordering a burger as well, how was he supposed to know you would want more than that? I get that everyone loves fries, but expecting him to read your mind is just crazy. You can\u2019t say you\u2019re not hungry then get mad that you don\u2019t get more than you asked for.", "YTA.

What fries?\"", "This is the way. If you ordered two fries & he ate his & part of yours, he would be TAH. But, you ordered one fry & he did leave you some to eat.\nNTA.

So yeah she may have not known, but doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t?
