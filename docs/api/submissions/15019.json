He wanted to get cheeseburgers, so we did, and I said I wasn\u2019t very hungry but wanted some fries & could we get a large to share? He said that would be fine. \n\nI ended up recognizing that I was hungrier than I thought & got a cheeseburger for myself. I asked him if he still wanted to do the large fry to share and he said yes. \n\nOn the way home, he was going to town on them, about 2 miles away from the restaurant and less than a mile away from my house, I reached into the bag to eat a fry and there were barely any left. Maybe 10 fries in the container. Including what was in the bottom of the bag (which was unknown to both of us at the time) there were about 1/4 of the fries left.\n\nI instantly became upset, and said something like \u201cyou ate all the fries, wtf\u201d & I feel angry, and kind of withdraw into myself a bit, trying to calm down but obviously very angry. He says \u201csorry, I\u2019m really bad about waiting to eat\u201d. I say, \u201cthat\u2019s so rude. You knew I wanted some.\u201c He says \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know you wanted that many\u201d. He grows silent & we get home & I\u2019m not letting it go. I am want a real apology & acknowledgement for my feelings out of the deal (which is starting to feel like pulling teeth). I\u2019m getting excuses, mixed in with maybe 1 or 2 \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2019s\u201d. We end up settling on \u201cI thought a quarter of the fries would be enough since you said you didn\u2019t want many\u201d, but that didn\u2019t feel honest since there was less than a quarter left in the container & we didn\u2019t even know there were any in the bag.\n\nAITA for being upset at my bf for eating almost all the fries and not accepting his defense immediately instead of a complete apology?\n\nEdit: Therapy can\u2019t compare to hundreds of people on the internet telling you \u201cyou suck\u201d. I want to say thanks to everyone who has shared their opinion. I truly am here to gain perspective and make changes for myself to improve my relationship, and those things seem clearer to me now. This post is bigger than I expected, and I want to keep going through comments for any new information that might help me or questions that pop out, but I think I\u2019ve gotten most of what I needed & am grateful.

Did he tell you that? Are you \"drilling\" or are you simply trying to resolve conflict or be heard while he is running away and calling you a nag?

We grew up poor and my mother's culinary skills aren't great, so we developed survival cooking skills very early. We had no choice.", "I mean, I\u2019m not talking hot hot, like right of the fryer hot. But still hot. Hot enough that you can take a bite. But, I normally wait for my food to cook a bit before I eat it so I don\u2019t burn myself.\n\nI\u2019m also country. It\u2019s country miles, not city. \n\nI also don\u2019t find many foods inedible. McDonald\u2019s fries are the only ones that dip in value so incredibly fast but I mean, if they\u2019re still warm, there\u2019s no harm. Literally. It\u2019s just food, and it still tastes the same. \n\nMy point isn\u2019t is it *better* my point is, who in their right mind (even assuming he isn\u2019t driving here) eats so many fries (McDonald\u2019s fries are large. I know the chain wasn\u2019t mentioned but, Yknow, since they deteriorate the fastest I\u2019m using this), in a moving vehicle, with limited napkins, where you will undoubtedly get crumbs/salt flakes/oil *somewhere* on you or the seats, it just isn\u2019t sanitary. Assuming you\u2019re driving, that\u2019s worse.\n\nOverall, the argument isn\u2019t whether or not you should eat and drive. I tend not to. It\u2019s whatever for me. I simply said it was rude to eat the majority of the fries and that it\u2019s weird to eat so many while driving. Maybe it\u2019s just me, as if I\u2019m not driving, I get car sick, but we also weren\u2019t allowed to eat in the car growing up (for good reason) so, idk man, I can wait the 15 miles back home without starving or without my food being gross. Certain foods, no, I wouldn\u2019t take to go (if they get soggy. I can\u2019t handle soggy), but this isn\u2019t really that."]}
