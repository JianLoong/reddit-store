Yes, the container was empty but in the end there were some in the bag. So it should be a nonissue.", "Ohh, well yea he could have definitely been a bit more conservative with his eating. He should have made an attempt to make it up to you if he was truely sorry.\n\nHowever both of you should be more mindful of your appetites or just order more than enough and that way you can save the rest for later.", "We\u2019re going to take some time before we talk. I want to believe him that he was too in the moment to have heard me. At the end of it, he finally conceded to validating my experience. We were trying something he wanted & he was super into it & I was enjoying it besides this one specific thing, which was just 1 step further than i wanted to go. He really is a good person. I\u2019m trying to make sense of things. We\u2019re on our last leg though because it\u2019s so difficult to just get an apology without first having to cater and validate him repeatedly anytime there is conflict. It\u2019s definitely a maturity issue. We\u2019re both trying and wanting to make changes, and are recently off a 6 month break. Not sure I\u2019m ready to call it, or if I should bear with him for the changes. There has been improvement, but it\u2019s hard.", "It wasn\u2019t worth the drive or effort, and we only had my car. I\u2019ll admit, I wanted him to drop the defense before I accepted the apology. I tried to keep things light & joking. I calmed down before we got back to the house.

It\u2019s just fries.. but that\u2019s the point. Shouldn\u2019t an apology be equally as easy? I mean he basically ate them ALL. A simple apology would have solved the problem right there. It was already late. It wasn\u2019t worth turning around to get more. For me, I guess it wasn\u2019t really about the fries.", "Oh yes, we have been over it many many times. There are deep rooted issues. I try to be understanding of the things that cause him to have a hard time, he is extremely sensitive to shame and guilt and it\u2019s difficult for him to validate other peoples emotions that disagree with him because it makes him feel like a bad person. I love him to death, and I try to be understanding, but I\u2019m tired & I don\u2019t struggle with apologizing or accepting responsibility if I do something shitty. I have to deal with a defense before I get what I need, which I need to coach him through every time.\n\nEdit: I try to control my reactions and approach things sensitively to try to find solutions.
