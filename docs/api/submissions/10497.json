I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a generational thing or a mom thing, but I think Boomer moms especially tend to be of the attitude that their children are extensions of themselves, therefore their adult kids\u2019 business is their business to share. It\u2019s toxic AF and you have every right to be mad. I\u2019d definitely get a PO Box, as she clearly can\u2019t be trusted with your information. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going thru that.", "Boomer moms really love sharing their kids medical information with anyone who will listen. NTA. Take some space and after you both cool off ask your mom what motivated her to share this information. Was she hoping to get advice? Social support? If it's the latter maybe you can agree to her discussing her worries with a couple of close friends in private messages or in person but not on Facebook. Explain you don't want to fight or be angry, but that this isn't something you're comfortable with. It might be helpful to explain that employers, insurance companies, or any random person can easily find this and it may lead to consequences beyond feeling violated.", "Info: Do you live with your mother?

Second, tell medical providers no one is authorized to have your medical info, especially if they call for appointments, etc.  (If you have a P.O. Box, she won't see any info at all.)  Tell your friends not to leave any type of messages for you with your mother.  Third, who's paying for the internet access?  You say she lives with you; is she paying bills?  Is there any sort of adult day care in your area where you can drop her off and pick her up at the end of your day (or one day per week), thereby keeping her occupied when you're not home.  She needs to find some sort of activity outside of social media.", "NTA.\n\nShe crossed a line. Anybody would have gotten mad.", "NTA. Yeah that would piss me off too. Time to stop confiding in her!", "NTA\n\nOP, your mother has given you a wonderful gift - you can share her private info with the rest of the world.\n\nShe had a doctor's appointment?

So is accessing their account and reading private messages without permission. Yet OP's joking that the mom spending 5 years in prison would be the best karma. The best karma would actually be the two of them sharing a cell, where they'd both have about as much privacy as they do now.\n\nOr, we can accept that neither of their crimes are going to ruin the next 5 years of the other person's life and treat this like the low-stakes post that it is. That is also an option.", "That\u2019s been an issue lately with my mother.  I had to explain to her that I would not violate someone else\u2019s privacy.

I keep active an average amount, I eat healthy so on and so forth. There\u2019s no reason I should be unhealthy. It\u2019s likely caused from dehydration which was the reason I had to get the tests done in the first place, and it\u2019s a follow up appointment to make sure everything\u2019s smooth. That however was not the issue. It was the leaking of private information.", "Yeah the whole logging into her Facebook thing probably not the best idea.

Or, get a safe deposit box at a bank.", "Humor's good, but there are people on here who really think everything is that deep. But, a little confused now. Commenters seem to be under the impression she shared this publicly, as opposed to someone just confiding in some friends about what's going on in their family life (which is something that naturally affects a parent). So, was it public? And if so, why would it take logging into her account rather than simply viewing it from your own?", "Lol sue mom for breach of HIPAA", "Can you get a Post office box your mail so mom can't get it.

Nobody going to jail for opening mail in their own house.   Hell, I opened neighbor's mail before that got accidentally delivered to my house.   Not going to jail for it.", "It's so cute you actually think that the police are going to bother with someone opening the mail in their own house.  Because yeah, there's a whole lot of people in jail for opening their roommates mail.", "Her friends gave you confirmation, but you couldn't get confirmation without checking her messages?", "No need to go that far. Get a mail box with a lock, and keep the key.\n\nIf she complains tough titties. She has proven she can be trusted and can get her mail when you unlock the mail box", "If you still live with her, getting a PO Box is the safe bet to legally force her to stop. As I don't want to get into the nuances of the whole Parent and Child grey area of the mail laws. If she would open the mail you receive at the PO Box, you could file charges against her for messing with your mail.\n\nHowever without going into the legal side of things, what's she done is a complete break of privacy and you should be upset. If you still live with her and are able to move out, please move. If you're unable to, start looking into ways that will help you get out.\n\nEdit after I read more of your comments, she is stay at your house, so it doesn't matter about what I said. If she is incapable of living by herself, move her into assisted living. It also might be better to update the post about how your mother found out.", "Still illegal", "Its a small crime yes but still punishable\n\nThat is a federal law so even if the local cops didnt want to do anything about it the feds are the next ooption\n\nNot saying this is the case for op its totally different but opening others mail can be apart of fraud\n\n\nIt also depends on if the person presses charges but with federal they dont have to\n\nSo be a dick about it all you want but that doesnt stop it from being a crime noob", "Honestly, I was pissed and wanted hard evidence. I\u2019m not gonna lie.", "LOL... the cops are not going to do shit.  They are going to laugh their asses off.  \"Sorry officer, I opened by mistake thinking it was my mail\"\n\nEnd of.  There's no case here.  You people watch too much bad TV.", "Omg i dont think you read\n\nMakes sense you dont understand its a federal crime but ok", "Uh huh.  And I Don't think you read.

The law only allows for government fines and loss of Medicare/Medicaid contracts. The person who had their privacy violated has no right to sue under HIPAA.

You\u2019re just trying to take care of her and she sounds like a handful.", "Yeah, I remember how murky the whole thing was. I worked for an IRB and we had to study it extensively as one of the many regulatory concerns we had to be mindful of. It didn't apply to us, but it applied to the research."]}
