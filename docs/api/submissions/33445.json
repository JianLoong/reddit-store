You said you were shocked and upset at first and it took time to adjust.  Please try to give people you tell that same grace.   \n Having children THAT close together is very unusual.

Though, a quick google could have given you all this information anyway. \n\nBut your OB/GYN definitely should have had the safe sex, BC talk with your partner and given her all the info she needed regarding pregnancy so close after the last birth.

Even if you had no kids, you're 29 years old, you know that sex without birth control = baby. \n\nOf course you're not solely to blame, but considering the context, your wife's body has gone through some serious change - all the organs in her abdomen SHIFTED to grow the baby, she pushed the equivalent of a WATERMELON out of her vagina, her hormones are going absolutely crazy, the last thing she wants to do is get back onto hormonal birth control, which will throw another spanner into the hormonal shit show thats happening. \n\nThe least you can do is put a goddamn condom on when you have sex. \n\nObviously that doesn't change the situation, and Irish twins (though there *can* be complications) can and do come out perfectly healthy. I would definitely be a lot more cautious and vigilant for this pregnancy compared to the first, and really REALLY start to plan for how you are going to deal with having a newborn baby and a new baby on the way. \n\nGood luck, congratulations, and buy some fucking condoms.", "Is she your girlfriend or wife?

I miscarried those twins.\n\nI miscarried a lot. Took 11 pregnancies to get 3 living children.\n\nSo it goes. As Kurt Vonnegut would say. \n\nI had a tubal ligation 5 hours after my youngest was born and then resumed the practice around 10 days later. The human body is remarkable.\n\nHaving said that, recovery time is MUCH SLOWER after the second and subsequent children close together. If at all possible see if you can piggyback time off for yourself and other friends and family members to help her with the babies when the second baby is due/the last 6-8 week's of pregnancy. It's also not uncommon for babies that close together to come early. Be prepared for a possible preemie but hope for that not being the case.

This is the second unintended pregnancy. I hope you both are more responsible going forward! And this time around please 6weeks is when you should be cleared for sex because even if your feeling great, had an easy birth no stitches etc you have a dinner plate sized wound in your uterus from the placenta post birth and that takes time and rest to heal!

A lot of women just don't want to have sex that early because they're still uncomfortable with their bodies, healing, tired, overwhelmed and not in the mood for sex.

No, it is so freaking normal one 'no' is not enough that I myself can only grasp it logically how wrong it is but emotionally I shrug over it.\n\nI am not saying you are like that, I only explain where they might come from.

The main reason seems to be because of how prevalent the belief is that one cannot get pregnant again until they've had their first postpartum period, so contraception is not used based on a false sense of security. BUT ovulation can actually occur as early as 28 days postpartum and can occur before menstruation occurs. It's not common for it to occur that early, but the main point is that it can occur before the first period.

Shitty friends, families, partners, etc *do* pressure and manipulate women into getting abortions they don\u2019t want, and no, not \u201ceveryone else\u201d agrees that that\u2019s a shitty thing to do. Plenty of people in power such as counselors and nurses will tell women that they should abort in certain circumstances because it\u2019ll be \u201cwhat\u2019s best for them and their baby!\u201d. Why? Because people in these fields are *humans*, and humans can behave in immoral ways if they feel they\u2019re working in the name of some greater good. \n\n\nWomen in less than optimal circumstances who choose to forgo abortions are frequently treated as through they\u2019re making an immoral decision by choosing to birth their children, rather than \u201cprevent suffering\u201d. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ve seen it first hand during my work in DV shelters. I\u2019ve seen it reinforced by entire social circles with young pregnant women, and I\u2019ve seen support for this behavior all over the internet. I had an interaction just yesterday with someone who insisted an 18 year old women with a shitty boyfriend should be *nagged* into getting an abortion, and *I* was attacked for pointing out how gross that is. This translates into real life consequences and being in denial about it does such a disservice. These people don\u2019t exist in a vacuum. They have *jobs*, they hold social influence, they\u2019re *activists*, they\u2019re people in all sorts of positions in society. \n\nWhen you build support for abortion on the basis of arguments like \u201cwell it\u2019s better they abort than have a baby when they\u2019re poor\u201d, people turn abortion into a pseudo moral obligation.", "I'm not correcting anyone and I haven't Even given my own opinion, so I don't understand why are you replying me with all that.", "hey just wanted to say that you're not slacking!! you're recovering and carrying for a newborn! you can't be expected to do everything that you normally would! yes your husband is taking on extra work that you would usually do but you are NOT slacking!!", "I mean, it is real method (lactational amenorrhea) just not 100% effective", "Ya same. Let's not shame a couple for wanting to have intimacy", "I just wanted to thank you and Tattered Jacket for sharing your honest feelings and thoughts, this isn't ever easy to talk about. I feel like I understand both sides of it, and I wish we could talk about this openly, more easily, to help others make a more informed choice for themselves, and help those on both sides with feelings of loss, grief, possible regret, even just frustration. This is why this is such a hard topic and it feels like an impossible decision. I'm not sure there is ever really a right or wrong decision. I think we all do the best we can in the moment, and always wonder \"what if?\" afterward, regardless of the decision we make. Hugs to you both, and anyone reading who has or will be in the same boat.", "Same with the IUD. I got pregnant with a long time boyfriend, but our relationship was not good. He was kind of controlling, our relationship was up & down and when we found out I was pregnant he was all about having ME move into his living space, but had no interest in moving in with me or otherwise finding a living space that would work for both of us (which was my suggestion:let's find a place to live that we both like). \n\nHe at the time lived far outside town & I felt like it would be a very isolating situation for me.  In addition he lived in a house with several people, and I didn't want to be pregnant/moving into a house with people I wasn't comfortable with.  \n\nHis lack of interest in compromise made me feel uncared for and that he was clearly putting his wants first, with no concern for my comfort. That was enough for me to realize I didn't want to go through with pregnancy with him.  It was the right choice - I was in no shape to be a parent and honestly that relationship would not have lasted either way.  I don't regret having that abortion, I regret being in a long term relationship with someone who didn't help me feel comfortable going through with a pregnancy & didn't help me feel prioritized AT ALL.", "Most people who have had an elective abortion do not report regret later. Relief is the most common emotion expressed.\n\nWhich doesn't mean that other people are *wrong* if they have other feelings, of course.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that\u2019s been your experience. \u201cBetter to abort than to be a poor parent\u201d is a shitty reason to support choice. \u201cBecause it\u2019s her body and she gets to have bodily autonomy\u201d is the fundamental reason. Everything else is a sad attempt to appease people who don\u2019t believe that women have the right to bodily autonomy.\n\nI had a baby: it was a normal pregnancy with no adverse events: it was still hard on my body. It almost always is. No regrets, but nobody should be forced to put their body through that. \n\nEdit: nor should they be pressured to put themselves through an abortion, unless there\u2019s a medical issue. \u201cMy body, my choice,\u201d right? not \u201cmy body but I\u2019m poor so I guess it\u2019s your choice,\u201d fuck that", "People act like women can't actually have high desire and it's annoying af", "And for those who (primarily) express relief, I'm guessing it's normal to have a twinge of \"what if\", especially around other people's kids or their own future kids. \n\nAnd for those who (primarily) express regret, I'm guessing it doesn't mean they're never relieved that a child isn't added to the equation when they're struggling. \n\nNo one in the history of ever has made an irreversible decision and never ever thought that decision was perfect on every single day that followed"]}
