Id give a light ESH cause you suck at pulling out and the family can be a concerned maybe in a *slightly* more supportive way but most people are told to wait 6 weeks at minimum before baby making deeds should be done.

You said you were shocked and upset at first and it took time to adjust.  Please try to give people you tell that same grace.   \n Having children THAT close together is very unusual.

Though, a quick google could have given you all this information anyway. \n\nBut your OB/GYN definitely should have had the safe sex, BC talk with your partner and given her all the info she needed regarding pregnancy so close after the last birth.

Even if you had no kids, you're 29 years old, you know that sex without birth control = baby. \n\nOf course you're not solely to blame, but considering the context, your wife's body has gone through some serious change - all the organs in her abdomen SHIFTED to grow the baby, she pushed the equivalent of a WATERMELON out of her vagina, her hormones are going absolutely crazy, the last thing she wants to do is get back onto hormonal birth control, which will throw another spanner into the hormonal shit show thats happening. \n\nThe least you can do is put a goddamn condom on when you have sex. \n\nObviously that doesn't change the situation, and Irish twins (though there *can* be complications) can and do come out perfectly healthy. I would definitely be a lot more cautious and vigilant for this pregnancy compared to the first, and really REALLY start to plan for how you are going to deal with having a newborn baby and a new baby on the way. \n\nGood luck, congratulations, and buy some fucking condoms.", "Is she your girlfriend or wife?

I miscarried those twins.\n\nI miscarried a lot. Took 11 pregnancies to get 3 living children.\n\nSo it goes. As Kurt Vonnegut would say. \n\nI had a tubal ligation 5 hours after my youngest was born and then resumed the practice around 10 days later. The human body is remarkable.\n\nHaving said that, recovery time is MUCH SLOWER after the second and subsequent children close together. If at all possible see if you can piggyback time off for yourself and other friends and family members to help her with the babies when the second baby is due/the last 6-8 week's of pregnancy. It's also not uncommon for babies that close together to come early. Be prepared for a possible preemie but hope for that not being the case.

This is the second unintended pregnancy. I hope you both are more responsible going forward! And this time around please 6weeks is when you should be cleared for sex because even if your feeling great, had an easy birth no stitches etc you have a dinner plate sized wound in your uterus from the placenta post birth and that takes time and rest to heal!

The point is you never know and it doesn't happen to other people because they're likely using protection. \n\nBTW it's common enough to be called having Irish twins and it happens to plenty of people.

What you SHOULD worry about though is that your wife's body hasn't fully recovered and isn't ready for another baby.

The fact that this is a surprise to you is concerning", "It's pretty common knowledge that it's very easy to get pregnant right away after having a baby (though if breastfeeding can make it less likely) that's why at woman's 6 week post birth check up, when they finally give you to go ahead to safely have sex again, doctors really push immediately getting on birth control. A lot of women just don't want to have sex that early because they're still uncomfortable with their bodies, healing, tired, overwhelmed and not in the mood for sex. People are probably shocked and blaming you because they feel you were being careless to not use protection and having bad pullout game and because women are less likely to initiate sex or be horny so soon after pushing out a baby so they assume you were the one who couldn't wait", "But you do understand by now that it is that uncommon because other people act responsible by listening to the doctors and giving it at least six weeks before having sex and then having only safer sex? \n\nIt is not uncommon because women don't get pregnant that soon after birth but because it is known that a woman's body should get time before the next pregnancy and they act accordingly.\n\nTherefore an adult couple who already has children acting like nobody could have seen that coming that she gets pregnant again when having unprotected sex is indeed kinda annoying and mind baffling. \n\nI don't think it is all on you though. It is on both of you. Only thing I can imagine is that they think it was you who wanted the sex and your partner just gave in. If that wasn't the case your gf should make that clear. I can understand that assumption. Yes, I see how such questions can be out of concern. If someone you love does something dangerous and gets injured many asked shocked why they would do something like that. And it is not uncommon that men like to ask again and again for sex until they get it.\n\nI am sorry but I only had one relationship in my 47 years where one \"no\" was enough and I wasn't only in abusive relationships. I have ex's I would not call bad guys and still they tried to talk me into sex when I wasn't in the mood. Let's  put aside the abusive or toxic relationships where they didn't even care it was hurtful for me because they had given me freaking inflammations themselves. No, it is so freaking normal one 'no' is not enough that I myself can only grasp it logically how wrong it is but emotionally I shrug over it.\n\nI am not saying you are like that, I only explain where they might come from. Especially the women might out of experience just assume, even though that is wrong, that a woman that shortly after giving birth can't really have wanted sex herself and you probably talked her into that and she just gave in, being too tired to say 'no' and wanted just her peace. Like I said, your gf should make the statement that it wasn't like that and you two were equally involved in making the decision to have sex.

I had my kid at 27 and was told that that\u2019s getting up there and I was like, why, because it\u2019s not 1682 and I\u2019m not married and preggers at 17? SMH. Don\u2019t worry, doctors are stupid people too.", "It\u2019s not as if younger people aren\u2019t harassed about being pregnant too. There are like 10 years of fertility that are acceptable, apparently.", "That\u2019s why I said unlikely not impossible. Glad your sister is so fertile!", "Yeah my second pregnancy happened in spite of breast feeding", "Do people really wait for someone to give them birth control? Condoms are available in the shops right?", "I just had a baby and my dr saw me 2 (it was really like a week and a half) & 6 weeks postpartum. i know it\u2019s different everywhere but my friends in various states who had babies this year said the same.", "Yes and he\u2019s just saying \u201cshe didn\u2019t have complications\u201d okay she still has a gigantic hole in her uterus. I was cleared at 6 weeks, too, and still was (and still am) extremely cautious 7 months postpartum. There are no \u201coopsies\u201d when you\u2019re a grown adult lol", "I was told both at hospital and 6 weeks post partum to use BC", "Did I say that? Because i dont think i said that. I think I said that she was tired and therefore it was more likely that didn\u2019t think to use birth control/wasnt thinking that through, where as he wouldn\u2019t have been *as* exhausted and wouldve been able to be more logical in the situation. I did not say she was *unnable* to make decisions about her body, nor am I insinuating its somehow sexual assault to interact with your willing and consenting partner because they\u2019re tired.", "I hope they live somewhere abortions are legal, but I assure you, making abortions illegal never stops them from being an option.  It just makes them more less safe.\n\nETA; I am not suggesting anyone pursue a back alley abortion. But if you can safely get the pill from a licensed medical provider, that's an option many places", "YES ! I get it frequently .. \nI\u2019m 23 and 24 in February - I\u2019ll be having #2 in mid March \nOur first child was born in late 2022 so they will be 2 under 2 (roughly 16 months apart) but the way that people have grimaced at me (despite being married, despite having a degree) like I\u2019m a child lol. \nIf it isn\u2019t forced, no one should be judged on their reproductive choices!!", "I was just saying the pill wasn't offered to me until my follow up visit, which was 6 weeks pp, and I really didn't need condoms because doc said no sex for 6 weeks. \n\nBased on other comments I guess some OBs see patients 2 weeks and again 6 weeks, that just wasn't what my doctor did.", "No shit abortions keep happening in places where it\u2019s illegal but you seriously overestimate how easy getting an illegal abortion is lol. You almost sound dismissive. \n\nI live in a third world country and no, you can\u2019t just get abortion medication all nillywilly without a lot of different risks. Getting caught can even be deadly in certain circumstances. Backalley abortions are guaranteed to get you trafficked.\n\nAnd even in first world countries it can also be pretty hard and risky depending on the person\u2019s family, people who might snitch, funds, age, how conservative wherever they live is and so on.\n\nSo no, it\u2019s not an option in many places.", "Seeing as they\u2019ve announced it, seems they\u2019re not interested in aborting.\n\nIf they were, they could have gone outside the state quietly. Now it\u2019s too late, esp if it\u2019s illegal where they live now"]}
