Is it unbearable? Of course not.", "I don\u2019t understand these YTAs. The friend literally kept  prodding to get the same answer, so OP restated the same answer. \n\nSome people actually require AC to function normally. \n\nFor example: I had 3rd degree burns to 30% of my body. Air conditioning is so important, because I have issues regulating my body temperature in heat. I can get heat exhaustion walking outside on a very sunny, humid day up here in the PNW (76 degrees even). Hell if there is stagnant air, I start sweating from it. (Also grew up in Florida and if is going to be 95 degrees, a common sense thing is to have the AC on)\n\nNTA OP, an oven of a house at 87 degrees sounds fucking miserable.", "??? Some people can\u2019t afford an AC", "It would also depend on the amount of humidity.  The Deep South is very humid.  Also if you are used to air conditioning in your home and in your car it would be difficult to adjust in a building without it.  I've stayed in hotels in countries with it and would have it on the lowest setting at night so it was just bearable to sleep in and so I wouldn't need to adjust so much when outside in the mornings.", "OP has said it's not a financial decision. They could afford it but the friend's family doesn't seem to mind it as much. That's their prerogative, people get used to different things and probably are innately different in what temperatures feel comfortable. But when you're talking about a room temperature so far above what is considered \"normal\", they should not be surprised that people are not rushing to spend time in their house. Somebody above said the OP couldn't stand it \"for five minutes\" but that's not what hanging out at someone's house entails. I could put up with anything for five minutes. I'm not gonna spend an afternoon in heat that uncomfortable.\n\nI also didn't find the \"finally tolerable\" comment too bad. That lets the friend know that it's not that the OP doesn't want to spend time with them! The OP is basically saying they are happy that they can now be comfortable while visiting.\n\nEven if the friend doesn't mind the heat as much as OP, I can't believe they wouldn't be delighted to spend time at OP's house in the summer. That's the only part I don't understand. it's not like OP said I can't see you at all, they say come over here where it's comfortable. I would say yes please and thank you!", "Honestly! I find it hard to be sympathetic since the last couple of summers have reached 40\u00b0c in the UK and a) our houses are built to retain heat and b) very few people have AC. I find that unbearable but 30\u00b0c is normally alright. 35\u00b0c/95\u00b0f is where I find it starts to get really uncomfortable. OP definitely came across as an AH.", "They\u2019re doing just fine roasting themselves in the summer. \ud83e\udd41", "Yes it was the use of fahrenheit instead of centigrade.  I live in the UK and think in centigrade only because we got notified of the temperature a lot over the tannoy and on electronic billboards in the street in other European countries and it was in centigrade only.  I don't think the temperature was mentioned much in weather forecasts on UK television back then only wether it was going to be wet or sunny.  When we arrived at Esbjerg in Denmark one Easter we were informed on the boat that the temperature was 10C and I thought to myself that was quite mild.  It wasn't.  It was cool and dry.  In the UK 10C would feel colder because of the wind and dampness with it.", "The climate is fine.\nPeople have been saying there\u2019s a problem for a long time and it hasn\u2019t gotten worse.", "Miserably I assume.", "Often they don't.  In some African countries they do everything in the morning when it's cooler and often before sunrise.  In most European countries they have shutters over windows on the ground floor and umbrella blinds over windows above the ground floor especially on south, south east and south west facing windows.", "Yep, and it's even more miserable indoors. At least 87 outdoors has some breeze. Inside it's torture.", "This is actually the annoying thing. We really need to rely on ventilation a lot more than we do. Pleasant temperature with a breeze is intolerable indoors. Plus I've never seen a place where the west facing rooms are not horrifyingly hot in summer afternoons.", "He repeatedly explained to his friend why. The friend wouldn't let it go and really wanted him at his house. People say shit. What op said wasn't that horrible. At 87 everyone knows it's really hot. This isn't rocket science and let's not act like no one shit talks. What the f is up with everyone so offended by every stupid remark? His remark was made in jest.", "I live in a similar climate btw so yeah,  those numbers are comparable to what i see here in the summer. Has no bearing. 87 INDOORS is sweltering and, spouting numbers isn't going to change the fact it's ridiculous to suffer in that kind of environment when they can hang at op's.", "And the inside of a volcano gets even hotter!! Still not looking to rent one. Don\u2018t gatekeep feeling warm dude", "Okay. And 87\u00b0 is still too fookin hot indoors.", "Okay, that's it.  Have him come visit your house in the warmer months.  Does he turn on the heat in the winter?", "I had cancer 2 years in a row. Both treatments gave me hot flashes . I was in treatment over the summer months & declared in remission June this year. I remember one January day, it was like -10f & I had to go outside with no coat for like 20 mins to cool down it got so bad.\n\nI wasnt well enough to live alone. My moms house doesn't have AC but my bedroom had a window unit that she would want me to turn off at 10 pm to save money. The heat made EVERY symptom I had SO much worse, including nausea. Even mouth sores burn when swear drips in your mouth. \n\nAC for medical can be SO important. Heck, once treatment they tried made me cold sensitive. I had to use a towel to touch the IV to go to the bathroom cause the metal burned my fingers it was cold... I still had my room AC in the 70's.

As a result of not having AC, people will choose not to come.", "Those people know better than anyone that you hangout at the place that has AC.", "If it\u2019s not to save money, then I agree with all you\u2019ve said. But op could have been more direct. Say \u201cno, I\u2019m not comfortable at your house because of the heat, but you are welcome at my house.\u201d \n\nJust be direct. Don\u2019t make snide comments later.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine why anyone would keep their house so hot on purpose.", "Still sleeping with windows open because the hot air from summer wont leave my house lol", "Sure.  Go with that.", "I was just responding to the bit about people from cooler climates not getting it. Not getting what? There's nothing to 'get' - 30C isn't even hot.", "Oh wow.. it is great you are in remission though. I absolutely understand the almost ridiculous ways people with the sensitivity have to help it. I have to be super careful with temperatures because I do excessively sweat due to nerve issues, which can turn me from burning hot to so cold that I will shiver under a blanket for 10 minutes. Also, heat exponentially worsens my general nausea. Like if I can\u2019t cool down within 3 minutes I will violently puke. Ingesting a substantial amount of liquids will 1000% worsen it. Control of air temperature and humidity are the only things that can tame it that tames it. I live at the top of a hill, and of course have had it happen so many times walking home.\n\nJust having issues regulating core temp/being extremely sensitive absolutely sucks ass.

The commenter I replied to said \u201che\u2019s an AH for not having AC,\u201d which is not the idea you\u2019re conveying", "lol, so to avoid offence OP should suffer in an incredibly hot house?", "Good luck having meaningful real relationships if you're seriously going to get offended so easily.", "Not what I wrote.  I don't blame OP for not wanting to play microwave oven at his friends house, just how he spoke to his friend about it.  Some kids grow up without what other people take for granted.  Some of those kids absolutely take offense to words spoken carelessly, especially by those they consider a friend.  I 100% bet that the friend has asked for AC so he doesn't look bad in front of his friend(s), and is probably embarrassed that his dad won't buy it.  \n\nThat's all I'm sayin'.", "Sure.", "Right"]}
