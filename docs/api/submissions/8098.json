If you (heavens forbid) have an accident and die they will not look after your kid. If having a meal is being spoilt to them then they won't treat him nicely either.

She's no good, won't be a good role model to any future children you guys might have, definitely won't treat your son right ever (having a meal is spoilt she probably wants to take away his bed next) and is already trying to make you feel guilty and stick up for her parents even when they are wrong", "NTA.

Good daddy though.", "Her: My parents owe you nothing \n\nAlso Her: You owe me a trip\n\nShe was the one who insisted on leaving the boy with her parents in the first place. The fact that she cares more about the trip than her stepson is saying where her priorities are.\n\nOP should reconsider their relationship.", "Yes, this! \\^.  I hadn't considered this, despite my own livid reaction to this story--OMG, what happens to your boy if something happens to YOU?  These are the people that will raise him, care for him, feed him, in the wake  of your death?  Unless you have an explicit codicil to your will, which ensures that he will be cared by actual, living, breathing humans that won't torture him or starve him, how can you possibly remain in this situation?  Run, run away while you can and make sure that suitable arrangements are made, for your boy, legally, in case something horrid (heavens forbid) happens *to you.*  Sweet Moses on a Pony, staying with this woman could sentence your child to a lifetime of horror, neglect and worse.

She\u2019s definitely an AH, but not yet criminally. \n\nI can understand why he\u2019s putting up with more, because dating as a single dad is rough.. but, this is borderline abusive of his kid from the woman, and is abuse from the parents. \n\nAgree on taking a step back from this relationship. Definitely shouldn\u2019t be married to a woman who actively allows his kid to be abused.", "Oh man, I remember that one. Horrifically tragic...", "This is it right here", "Yes!! Some parents can be crazy. I also can see them feeding him healthy snacks that would make a meal like you described if the list was particularlintense and unreasonable. I'm not saying this is the case here, but more info is needed.", "That's what's so weird about this all, it seems the grandparents had no 'normal' meals available for the kid either???", "Hell, god forbid she does and the kid requires ***ANYTHING!***", "How dare you ask me to care for you child and then expect me to actually care for your child. What do I look like, a parent?", "I agree. This is nearly fraud in the inducement--she at the very least implied that she would be a good and caring and competent mother to his 9.y.o. boy.  That's clearly and patently and now *demonstrably* untrue. I think a case for an annulment *might* actually work.

Her parents don't owe him anything but its okay for them to babysit \ud83e\udd14 that makes no sense", "Oh yeah thats very much a possibility. She clearly didn't fall far from the tree. How can you call something like that spoiled? They probably don't believe in things like that.  Smh \ud83e\udd26", "Honestly I have no idea. My assumption is that they'd get mistaken for having anorexia, or labeled as picky and handled the way every other \"different\" child was handled: forced compliance. \n\nPlus in my limited experience and knowledge, safe foods can start with what's most consistent in their diet when they start experiencing the food issues. My son's OT believes his was triggered by bad experiences with food after we caught covid (also thanks to the grandparents), and that it altered his sense of smell and taste, and he had awful belly aches, during a time when he was already becoming more aware of his foods. He went from willingly eating chili and most fruits and veggies and trying everything given to him, to trying food and gagging and scream crying for weeks till we found a few foods that didn't get a terrible reaction out of him.

I do also have very real food allergies--I guess that's being \"spoilt,\" too, lol.  \n\nI was once forced to eat ice-cold scrambled eggs, that had sat on a kitchen table for **5 hours.**  Trust me, sports fans, being \"de-spoiled\" because you're 7 y.o. and can't force yourself to eat something that to you, is slimy and grossly unpleasant. and then eating it in even *worse* shape, 5 hours later--it took me 20+ years to get to the point where I could even look at an egg again.", "Absolutely. My sons step grandparents take my son for the weekend all the time. They treat him like their own, feed him full meals all day \ud83d\ude11 & he comes back with a bag full of stuff happy as can be.
