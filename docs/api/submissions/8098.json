If you (heavens forbid) have an accident and die they will not look after your kid. If having a meal is being spoilt to them then they won't treat him nicely either. As well as look at her priorities. She's angry at you for putting a child first. A child who wasn't being given a meal.

She's no good, won't be a good role model to any future children you guys might have, definitely won't treat your son right ever (having a meal is spoilt she probably wants to take away his bed next) and is already trying to make you feel guilty and stick up for her parents even when they are wrong", "NTA.
