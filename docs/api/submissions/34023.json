You could have a conversation with him about why he was so affected by just mentioning it if you want to understand him", "NTA. The guy you're dating needs to educate himself. If he wants to be intimate with women, and something tells me he does, then he must know how they work, what makes them tick and what can take them out of a race. He was raised badly. If you ever meet his mum and get a sort of relationship with her, this is something you might want to discuss.", "It\u2019s not weird. My wife was never shy about saying when she was on her period, even when we were early on in dating. It\u2019s a normal function of a woman\u2019s body. He needs to grow up.", "Cut and run babes.   \n\n\nCan you imagine if you were together and you asked him to pick you up some pads at the Supermarket or worse, bought them in his presence.

Everyone knows women get periods. You didn\u2019t dive into the nitty gritty of what was going on. You simply explained with limited detail why you weren\u2019t going to CrossFit. Welcome to life. Send him home to mama with no send back to receiver allowed. Apparently she has more to teach him so he can grow the hell up.", "NTA. He\u2019s not husband material.

Long gone are the days when girls have to hide their menstrual cycle. \nYou're BF is showing you who he is...believe him.", "What? I mean, by \"dating\" do you mean fucking? In which case, it's an entirely normal subject of discussion.

How old are you?", "NTA if he can\u2019t handle the word \u2018period\u2019 he certainly isn\u2019t going to be able to handle the dirty tampons, flooded underwear, blood spots, etc that come with living with a woman on her period.", "Oh come on, NTA at all.

Just say no to adult men who think it\u2019s inappropriate or gross or whatever to know about their SO\u2019s period. Ugh.

But you'd be an AH to yourself if you didn't recognize this as the red flag that it is.  This man is already clearly communicating to you that what you experience on a regular basis is something he thinks is \"inappropriate\" and you should stay quiet about.  That's something you will experience for literally a quarter of your adult life.  Do you want to be with someone who you will have to shelter from your normal, natural experiences 25% of the time?

For example, I have a friend who comes from India and in his specific culture, menstruation is a highly taboo subject for men. He once opened a draw with tampons inside and jumped back so quick you\u2019d think it was full of snakes. He\u2019ll also do a whole about face if he even hears the word \u201cperiod\u201d and panics when it\u2019s brought up. \n\nThis would be a good couple conversation to find out if this is a red flag situation or not.
