Fianc\u00e9 agreed that he was the AH and apologized for everything. He\u2019s offered to scale back the wedding entirely. His family has been putting a lot of pressure on him to have the splashiest wedding and it sounds like they\u2019re not going to contribute as much as they did with his sister\u2019s. They\u2019re the ones who pushed that this venue is a \u201cmust\u201d. My fianc\u00e9 told me that he spent last night realizing that he wants this wedding for US and not just do what his family demands, and he feels horribly guilty for getting mad about my parents\u2019 money. He only wishes I told him, not because he thought he deserved to make the decision, but because he felt as if I\u2019ve been keeping it a secret from him. He said that we can elope if I want to, but I know he still wants a big wedding for his family so we\u2019re looking at options in the middle that\u2019ll make us both happy!\n\n-\n\nI\u2019m not a wedding person. So I think it\u2019s a little hard to wrap my head around why my fianc\u00e9 is so upset, so I am looking for an impartial opinion.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has ideas for some big grand wedding. It means a lot to him, and while I would prefer to just elope, I am doing my best to research everything and plan an amazing wedding.\n\nI\u2019m not poor, and neither is my fianc\u00e9. We can afford quite a substantial wedding as is, just not the big fancy venue he was hoping for. He asked what my parents were going to contribute.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing - my parents do have a bit of a wedding fund saved up, but they\u2019ve been under a huge amount of financial strain lately. Last year, my dad had a heart attack, and this year my mom had surgery. Now their house is having issues that comes with a hefty bill. When I told my parents about the engagement, they mentioned the wedding fund, and I told them that I would love it if they spent it on the house, and their comfort would mean a lot more than a wedding upgrade.\n\nWhen I told my fianc\u00e9 this, he got very upset with me, saying that it\u2019s his decision too, and just because I\u2019m the bride doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m entitled to make all the decisions for the wedding. I don\u2019t disagree with him, but I didn\u2019t want to drag my parents finances into it. He wants me to go back and ask for the money, but I refused. I think we can have an amazing wedding without it.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Nothing\u2019s been booked, no other decisions have been made. The only decision I made was that I told my parents to use the money for something else and told my fianc\u00e9 I would not be asking for it.", "created_utc": 1670583506, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgu5vk/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_i_wont_be_asking_my/", "score": 984, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband sounds **horribly selfish**. He fully well knows what your parents are going through, yet feels like he is entitled to their money? So he wants your parents to live within a home with multiple issues just to have a fancier venue? That's disgusting, why would you want to marry a man like that?\n\nIf you can both afford to pay for a nice wedding with your own funds, do so. If he is so desperate for a better venue, save up more.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t get to decide what your parents do with their money. You can both already afford the wedding on your own, and sure it would be nice if they could help but your parents have extenuating circumstances. Their needs come before your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wants.", "NTA. He cares more about about a wedding than your parents' issues. That would be a big problem for me.", "NTA!!! You sound like a lovely, caring, practical and realistic person. You don\u2019t want to blow someone else\u2019s money that they could actually use for, say, living just to upgrade an already nice wedding. You really sound great. I\u2019m hoping this is an anomaly for hubs-to-be and that he\u2019s having a groomzilla moment.", "NTA this isn't a man you want to marry", "NTA\n\nWhoever wants a fancy wedding pays for it. You want to elope, and you are already compromising. Maybe your partner should learn some of that too?", "NTA He gets to decide whether you ask your own parents for money, but you don't get to decide the format for your own wedding? Am I reading it right that he wants a big wedding but you are still the one planning it?", "NTA! He has no say in how your parents spend that money, and you\u2019re a good kind person to ask them to use the money for their own needs. Health and wellbeing come way before fun and parties. Your future husband can also put up more money if it\u2019s so important to him, and it sounds like you\u2019d also support him from your own funds - but your parents are and should remain separate!", "NTA But the fact he's disregarding the wellbeing of his future MIL and FIL and would rather have a flashy wedding instead makes me think you should reconsider your relationship.", "NTA\nThat was money for your wedding, put away for you and honestly the groom wasn\u2019t known, you were the intended recipient. The groom being him is just happenstance. you had every right to ask your parents to use it in a way to make them more comfortable during a hard time. I may be leaning towards your side because I agree big weddings are honestly just a rip off and a waste of money, the memories are what matters. Not the size of the bill.\n\nAlso, seems kinda dick to be mad at you for using your money to help your parents instead of buying flowers that will wilt and a fancy venue.", "NTA.  Do not marry this man unless he *immediately* recognizes that acting entitled to other people\u2019s money for *his* wedding is Groomzilla behavior of the highest order and quits pushing this.", "NTA, you're not making a wedding decision, it's a family one. You'll want to talk to your parents and make sure he doesn't try to go behind your back to them.", "NTA. \n\nAnd if your intended cares more about the big splashy wedding party than about actually *marrying* *you*, then that's a big red flag. They are not listening/caring about your feelings at all. \n\nThe compromise would be that you have a small pretty nice wedding that you both pay for yourselves. If they refuse to consider that (or your feelings) then please think hard about slowing waaaaaay down on this relationship.", "NTA\n\n\nEverything about this is a problem.\n\n\n- that the compromise is that you do everything you can that he gets what he wants\n\n\n- that you do this and he still says bs like everything is like you want it and not seeing you already gave up what you wanted\n\n\n- that he has no empathy for the situation of your parents\n\n\n- what do his parents contribute?", "NTA. You're not making all the decisions about your wedding. You've advised your parents, who are struggling financially, to use their own money to pay for their home and medical bills. He is not entitled to a single penny of your parents' money. In all honesty, neither are you (not that it's an issue for you). Their security and well-being will always take precedence over a party.\n\nKeep your finances separate when/if you marry. A joint account for bills is fine, but don't allow him unfettered access to your money. This entitled behaviour isn't something that will disappear with wedding vows.", "NTA\n\nWow, it's your parents' money saved up for YOU (irrspective of who you marry). So you absolutely have a say in how to use it. Your fiance does not.\n\nYes all other wedding decisions should be made together. But not this.", "NTA.   \nI think it's unreasonable for your fiance to dip into your parents' fund and drag your parents' financials further, despite them have dedicated for it before. You're doing good here by protecting your parents financial health & their comfort.   \n\n\nAnd as you said before, your wedding can be already amazing without their contribution, so why the upgrade? Most people will remember about the experience of celebrating with you both, not about the venue itself. In fact, you can even downscale your wedding so that you can have an extended and amazing honeymoon/vacation/spend on your comfort afterwards if you like.  \n\n\nThat being said, did you (or himself) also asked his parents to contribute I wonder? That might contribute to the 'feeling imbalance' part.", "NTA \n\nTell groomzilla that he\u2019s not entitled to your parents money. You didn\u2019t need to consult with him about your parents finances.", "NTA, and you wouldn't be one even if you actually wouldn't get an amazing wedding without that money. You probably want to fix the expectations situation with groomzilla", "NTA. I love and respect the choices you're making. \n\nAny idea why he's so attached to putting on a big show for just one day - are there cultural expectations?", "NTA. His decision? Yet not his money! This entitlement. Are you ready to marry a man who think he\u2019s entitled to your parents money?\n\nAlso why are people in general planning weddings they don\u2019t have funds for? I have people like that in my family too\u2026 live within your means at all time", "NTA\n\nYou need to sit down and have a long hard talk with him that ends with serious reconsideration of the relationship. When two people don't share the same vision of the size and scope of their wedding, it's a good test for the hundreds of compromises and negotiations that are ahead of you. He needs to scale back, and you need to know that he can not only compromise graciously but without holding resentment. Ultimately, very little in a happy marriage is about who gets their way. It's about how you treat each other along the way. After 12 years of very happy marriage, I can tell you a lot about this topic. I've rarely seen couples who hold resentment over the wedding end up well.\n\nUnder no circumstances ask your parents for that money. You did the right thing.", "NTA, that is still your parents money and for you to reject. It\u2019s more common for people to use their own money for wedding these days and not rely on parents\u2019 money.\n\nThe fact he feels he gets final say and lacks empathy is a big red flag for the success of this marriage.", "NTA. He's being selfish and shallow.", "NTA\n\nAnd I think before going any further you should sit down and discuss priorities \n\nYour priority is that your parents comfort and wellbeing matters more than your wedding day (and personally I 100% think that is the right way round)\n\nHis stance seems to be that the wedding is a priority and that your parents ought to contribute if they intended to regardless of current circumstances \n\nINFO: are his parents contributing? Because while it may be traditionally paid for by the bride\u2019s family it seems unreasonable for him to want money from your parents in this situation if his aren\u2019t also contributing - but even if they wish to chip in that still doesn\u2019t mean your parents have to \n\nUltimately before you go further you should make sure you\u2019re both on the same page about this and other important matters - like what happens if either set of parents get sick and cannot afford to live independently?", "Absolutely NTA\n\n\nHe's prioritising a party over your parents' welfare.\n\n\nDo you really want to marry a man like that?!", "NTA. I\u2019m not a fan of big weddings but planning one is great for couples because it can reveal a lot about their relationship & the people involved. In your case, it revealed that your fianc\u00e9 wants what he wants, and if it takes other people\u2019s money to get him what he wants, then he wants other people to pay for it, no matter the burden it places on them. I would rethink marrying someone like that. It\u2019s selfish & it shows a lack of character.", "Hmm... the guy is the bridezilla. That's a switch. NTA. Your parents have more important things to do with money than giving your fianc\u00e9 his dream wedding.", "NTA its absolutely nothing to do with him what your parents do with their money. It was set aside for you not him. And you are absolutely spot on telling them to use it on themselves.\n\nYou are both adults, if he wants a fancy venue then he can start saving up and get married later. Its a privilege to get gifted money for a wedding, not a right. If your parents lose their home or health will he be inviting them to live rent free for life and paying their bills in return for the wedding fund? No.\n\nDont ask them, life is hard and its getting harder day by day. Your father sholuldnt be dealing with money stress post heart attack. Protect them from your fiance.\n\nHonestly please take some time and step back and re-assess the man you are marrying. This is worrying what he thinks he is entitled to.", "When you told your parents to keep the money, did they insist on giving it for the wedding or did they thank you for letting them keep it? Depending on how they responded, I think should help influence your decision. \nAlso, I think you and your fiance could benefit from working out a budget/financial plan. Discuss how much both of you are willing to spend on the wedding, itemize each expense, and calculate what the expected bills would look like and see if both of you are comfortable with the amount. \nIf you approach this issue in a reasonable manner and your fiance refuses/throws a fit, that is definitely something to think about. \nWhen my husband and I were engaged. We wanted to do just a courthouse wedding and a BBQ afterward. Then he got talked into having a formal ceremony by his best friend. Of course I was annoyed (I didn't want to spend the money) but I knew my husband now wanted it. That didn't mean rolling over and letting him blow all our money. Just lots of conversations and coming together to help each other make the wedding what we both wanted. \nHope this helps. \u2764", "NTA. It\u2019s your parents\u2019 money. It has nothing to do with your fianc\u00e9. Either he needs to downgrade his expectations, or you both need to save more to have the wedding of his dreams", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 has no right to expect anything from your parents. If his focus is on the wedding, not the marriage, and if money is already affecting the way he treats you, that's a huge red flag.", "NTA...But before you get married you and your fiance should sit down with a financial advisor and figure out where you two stand.   Because he sounds really entitled to money that has nothing to do with him. Especially when your parents need it to live.  It's not like they are spending on frivolous things.", "NTA, just tell him you will gladly ask HIS parents to contribute. \n\nYour big mistake was to tell him about the wedding fund when you didn't take it anyway and the money was never yours so far. On the other hand this gave your fiance the possibility to reveal some very huge red flags (feeling entitled to your parents money, caring more about a big wedding than about his bride and her family, trying to manipulate you with telling you you need to ask first before deciding to turn down your parents money when you aren't even married yet) and you would be kinda naive to ignore them. At least  insist on seperate finances after marriage and a prenup if you have assets to protect. I myself wouldn't marry this guy tbh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Does he only compromise or let you get \"your way\" on little things?  \n\nYou wanted to elope and he wants a wedding more extravagant than you can afford. The compromise shouldn't be just everything he wants... that's not a compromise. \n\nYou say he's kind and done a lot for you in some other comments... does he mention everything he's done for you ona regular basis?
