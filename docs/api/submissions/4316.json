Your husband sounds **horribly selfish**. He fully well knows what your parents are going through, yet feels like he is entitled to their money? So he wants your parents to live within a home with multiple issues just to have a fancier venue? That's disgusting, why would you want to marry a man like that?\n\nIf you can both afford to pay for a nice wedding with your own funds, do so. If he is so desperate for a better venue, save up more.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t get to decide what your parents do with their money. You can both already afford the wedding on your own, and sure it would be nice if they could help but your parents have extenuating circumstances. Their needs come before your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wants.", "NTA. He cares more about a bit wedding than your parents' issues. That would be a big problem for me.", "NTA!!! You sound like a lovely, caring, practical and realistic person. You don\u2019t want to blow someone else\u2019s money that they could actually use for, say, living just to upgrade an already nice wedding. You really sound great. I\u2019m hoping this is an anomaly for hubs-to-be and that he\u2019s having a groomzilla moment.", "NTA this isn't a man you want to marry", "NTA\n\nWhoever wants a fancy wedding pays for it. You want to elope, and you are already compromising. Maybe your partner should learn some of that too?", "NTA He gets to decide whether you ask your own parents for money, but you don't get to decide the format for your own wedding? Am I reading it right that he wants a big wedding but you are still the one planning it?", "NTA! He has no say in how your parents spend that money, and you\u2019re a good kind person to ask them to use the money for their own needs. Health and wellbeing come way before fun and parties. Your future husband can also put up more money if it\u2019s so important to him, and it sounds like you\u2019d also support him from your own funds - but your parents are and should remain separate!", "NTA But the fact he's disregarding the wellbeing of his future MIL and FIL and would rather have a flashy wedding instead makes me think you should reconsider your relationship.", "NTA\nThat was money for your wedding, put away for you and honestly the groom wasn\u2019t known, you were the intended recipient. The groom being him is just happenstance. you had every right to ask your parents to use it in a way to make them more comfortable during a hard time. I may be leaning towards your side because I agree big weddings are honestly just a rip off and a waste of money, the memories are what matters. Not the size of the bill.\n\nAlso, seems kinda dick to be mad at you for using your money to help your parents instead of buying flowers that will wilt and a fancy venue.", "NTA.  Do not marry this man unless he *immediately* recognizes that acting entitled to other people\u2019s money for *his* wedding is Groomzilla behavior of the highest order and quits pushing this.", "NTA, you're not making a wedding decision, it's a family one. You'll want to talk to your parents and make sure he doesn't try to go behind your back to them.", "NTA. \n\nAnd if your intended cares more about the big splashy wedding party than about actually *marrying* *you*, then that's a big red flag. They are not listening/caring about your feelings at all. \n\nThe compromise would be that you have a small pretty nice wedding that you both pay for yourselves. If they refuse to consider that (or your feelings) then please think hard about slowing waaaaaay down on this relationship.", "NTA\n\n\nEverything about this is a problem.\n\n\n- that the compromise is that you do everything you can that he gets what he wants\n\n\n- that you do this and he still says bs like everything is like you want it and not seeing you already gave up what you wanted\n\n\n- that he has no empathy for the situation of your parents\n\n\n- what do his parents contribute?", "NTA. You're not making all the decisions about your wedding. You've advised your parents, who are struggling financially, to use their own money to pay for their home and medical bills. He is not entitled to a single penny of your parents' money. In all honesty, neither are you (not that it's an issue for you). Their security and well-being will always take precedence over a party.\n\nKeep your finances separate when/if you marry. A joint account for bills is fine, but don't allow him unfettered access to your money. This entitled behaviour isn't something that will disappear with wedding vows.", "NTA\n\nWow, it's your parents' money saved up for YOU (irrspective of who you marry). So you absolutely have a say in how to use it. Your fiance does not.\n\nYes all other wedding decisions should be made together. But not this.", "NTA.   \nI think it's unreasonable for your fiance to dip into your parents' fund and drag your parents' financials further, despite them have dedicated for it before. You're doing good here by protecting your parents financial health & their comfort.   \n\n\nAnd as you said before, your wedding can be already amazing without their contribution, so why the upgrade? Most people will remember about the experience of celebrating with you both, not about the venue itself. In fact, you can even downscale your wedding so that you can have an extended and amazing honeymoon/vacation/spend on your comfort afterwards if you like.  \n\n\nThat being said, did you (or himself) also asked his parents to contribute I wonder? That might contribute to the 'feeling imbalance' part.", "NTA \n\nTell groomzilla that he\u2019s not entitled to your parents money. You didn\u2019t need to consult with him about your parents finances.", "NTA, and you wouldn't be one even if you actually wouldn't get an amazing wedding without that money. You probably want to fix the expectations situation with groomzilla", "NTA. I love and respect the choices you're making. \n\nAny idea why he's so attached to putting on a big show for just one day - are there cultural expectations?", "NTA. His decision? Yet not his money! This entitlement. Are you ready to marry a man who think he\u2019s entitled to your parents money?\n\nAlso why are people in general planning weddings they don\u2019t have funds for? I have people like that in my family too\u2026 live within your means at all time", "NTA\n\nYou need to sit down and have a long hard talk with him that ends with serious reconsideration of the relationship. When two people don't share the same vision of the size and scope of their wedding, it's a good test for the hundreds of compromises and negotiations that are ahead of you. He needs to scale back, and you need to know that he can not only compromise graciously but without holding resentment. Ultimately, very little in a happy marriage is about who gets their way. It's about how you treat each other along the way. After 12 years of very happy marriage, I can tell you a lot about this topic. I've rarely seen couples who hold resentment over the wedding end up well.\n\nUnder no circumstances ask your parents for that money. You did the right thing.", "NTA, that is still your parents money and for you to reject. It\u2019s more common for people to use their own money for wedding these days and not rely on parents\u2019 money.\n\nThe fact he feels he gets final say and lacks empathy is a big red flag for the success of this marriage.", "NTA. He's being selfish and shallow.", "NTA\n\nAnd I think before going any further you should sit down and discuss priorities \n\nYour priority is that your parents comfort and wellbeing matters more than your wedding day (and personally I 100% think that is the right way round)\n\nHis stance seems to be that the wedding is a priority and that your parents ought to contribute if they intended to regardless of current circumstances \n\nINFO: are his parents contributing? Because while it may be traditionally paid for by the bride\u2019s family it seems unreasonable for him to want money from your parents in this situation if his aren\u2019t also contributing - but even if they wish to chip in that still doesn\u2019t mean your parents have to \n\nUltimately before you go further you should make sure you\u2019re both on the same page about this and other important matters - like what happens if either set of parents get sick and cannot afford to live independently?", "Absolutely NTA\n\n\nHe's prioritising a party over your parents' welfare.\n\n\nDo you really want to marry a man like that?!", "NTA. I\u2019m not a fan of big weddings but planning one is great for couples because it can reveal a lot about their relationship & the people involved. In your case, it revealed that your fianc\u00e9 wants what he wants, and if it takes other people\u2019s money to get him what he wants, then he wants other people to pay for it, no matter the burden it places on them. I would rethink marrying someone like that. It\u2019s selfish & it shows a lack of character.", "Hmm... the guy is the bridezilla. That's a switch. NTA. Your parents have more important things to do with money than giving your fianc\u00e9 his dream wedding.", "NTA its absolutely nothing to do with him what your parents do with their money. It was set aside for you not him. And you are absolutely spot on telling them to use it on themselves.\n\nYou are both adults, if he wants a fancy venue then he can start saving up and get married later. Its a privilege to get gifted money for a wedding, not a right. If your parents lose their home or health will he be inviting them to live rent free for life and paying their bills in return for the wedding fund? No.\n\nDont ask them, life is hard and its getting harder day by day. Your father sholuldnt be dealing with money stress post heart attack. Protect them from your fiance.\n\nHonestly please take some time and step back and re-assess the man you are marrying. This is worrying what he thinks he is entitled to.", "When you told your parents to keep the money, did they insist on giving it for the wedding or did they thank you for letting them keep it? Depending on how they responded, I think should help influence your decision. \nAlso, I think you and your fiance could benefit from working out a budget/financial plan. Discuss how much both of you are willing to spend on the wedding, itemize each expense, and calculate what the expected bills would look like and see if both of you are comfortable with the amount. \nIf you approach this issue in a reasonable manner and your fiance refuses/throws a fit, that is definitely something to think about. \nWhen my husband and I were engaged. We wanted to do just a courthouse wedding and a BBQ afterward. Then he got talked into having a formal ceremony by his best friend. Of course I was annoyed (I didn't want to spend the money) but I knew my husband now wanted it. That didn't mean rolling over and letting him blow all our money. Just lots of conversations and coming together to help each other make the wedding what we both wanted. \nHope this helps. \u2764", "NTA. It\u2019s your parents\u2019 money. It has nothing to do with your fianc\u00e9. Either he needs to downgrade his expectations, or you both need to save more to have the wedding of his dreams", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 has no right to expect anything from your parents. If his focus is on the wedding, not the marriage, and if money is already affecting the way he treats you, that's a huge red flag.", "NTA...But before you get married you and your fiance should sit down with a financial advisor and figure out where you two stand.   Because he sounds really entitled to money that has nothing to do with him. Especially when your parents need it to live.  It's not like they are spending on frivolous things.", "NTA, just tell him you will gladly ask HIS parents to contribute. \n\nYour big mistake was to tell him about the wedding fund when you didn't take it anyway and the money was never yours so far. On the other hand this gave your fiance the possibility to reveal some very huge red flags (feeling entitled to your parents money, caring more about a big wedding than about his bride and her family, trying to manipulate you with telling you you need to ask first before deciding to turn down your parents money when you aren't even married yet) and you would be kinda naive to ignore them. At least  insist on seperate finances after marriage and a prenup if you have assets to protect. I myself wouldn't marry this guy tbh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The compromise shouldn't be just everything he wants... that's not a compromise. \n\nYou say he's kind and done a lot for you in some other comments... does he mention everything he's done for you ona regular basis? Do you have trauma in your past that you think you owe someone infinitely if they're sorta nice to you (not meant as a dig, I've been there)?\n\nReally look at your relationship to see if He's really as considerate as you've tried to say in some comments. I definitively  think you 2 need couples counselling asap if you're going to go through with this marriage.", "You don't remember the expensive decorations or food. You remember the look on your partners face or how they never dance but learned one especially for you.\n\nYou remember the moments in the wedding that remind you of love and family.\n\nUnless you are getting married for the wedding and not the life long commitment. Then you remember the people who wore the wrong thing and ruined your pictures.", "But you don't need to spend xxx thousand $ to create great memories. It is a celebration of you and him, not a show-off. To think what you could do with the money that some spend in a few hours just hurts my head. You could invest it in a house, car, or the future of your children. Some reals things for the future and not memories.", "Handling this yourself also means you can have a day you want - when other people contribute there can be an expectation that they will get a say", "I get what you\u2019re saying but OP is concerned about everyone\u2019s feelings so I\u2019m giving my advice based on that.  It\u2019s not bizarre for someone - like the fianc\u00e9 - to have an expectation based on their own culture\u2019s norms.  I don\u2019t think arranged marriages are a good idea but I don\u2019t think everyone who participates is awful, I recognize that it\u2019s part of their culture and everyone\u2019s culture grows at different places.  In OP\u2019s situation there is at least SOME cultural expectation of father of the bride obligations - that\u2019s why OP is posting.  I\u2019m addressing those feelings as real and valid.\n\nMe saying her father may be embarrassed is something that is likely to happen and that OP is likely to care about.  I don\u2019t support the underlying sexism, I support OP keeping it calm in her wedding prep as she has asked.  \n\nHe may bring it up to the father, I don\u2019t advocate this (and didn\u2019t above either), as they are family now.  I fully expect that convo to go poorly for him if he does, which probably would be better for everyone in the long run lol.", "Or the pained look on your parents\u2019 faces as they try to figure out if they can get away with sneaking extra food in their bags so they can keep their grocery bill down for the rest of the month.", "Right. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but you do support the underlying sexism otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be making up baseless claims about OPs \u2018cultural differences\u2019 to support your stance.\n\nNowhere in the post or in OPs comments does she say this is a *father* of the bride tradition, in fact she very clearly says \u2018my parents\u2019 when referring to them. \n\n\u201cHe asked what **my parents** were going to contribute\u201d\n\n\u201c**my parents** do have a big of a wedding fund saved up\u201d\n\n\u201c**they** mentioned the wedding fund, and I told **them** that would love it if **they** spent it on a house, and **their** comfort\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to drag **my parents** finances into it\u201d\n\n\u201cI told **my parents** to use the money for something else\u201d\n\nAnd yet you still managed to come to the conclusion that this must be a patriarchal tradition involving the father of the bride paying for the wedding as his \u2018final act\u2019 before giving her over to future husband. Sexist.\n\nETA - and is it possible that her mother might feel embarrassed about the financial situation as well or that only for the father of the bride too?"]}
