But at the same time it's understandable it's your birthday. So I see both sides and really you could have just had the celebration with your grandmother just to appease her and do it as a little family thing and Uncle Steve and then done your own thing on your own the way you wanted it just like you did anyway and didn't have to be a dick about it and I say this because did suck it up I have of all 365 days of the year mine is Christmas Day the absolute worst nobody is ever going to celebrate your birthday with you even your 50th that you spend alone this past year and forget birthday and Christmas presents it's Mary birthday so I say suck it up deal with Grandma still loves you and well and that you still love them and want to be around each other.
