You're just being a responsible neighbor. Giving them a shovel is a helpful gesture and a subtle hint that they need to take care of their sidewalk. It\u2019s better than having someone get hurt or reporting them, which could have started off your neighborly relationship on the wrong foot.", "Are you from the Upper Midwest of the US? If not, you'd fit in.\n\nThe snow shovel is not a Christmas present really; I'd just drop it off. But NTA for sure?", "Pretty passive aggressive, but still in NTA territory.", "NTA! Its petty and kind of hilarious. However given that its a safety issue, I would just blow them in. My town has some very steep fines for not clearly sidewalks. Thats probably why everyone in my town shovels within the same day. One local business got slapped with so many fines for not clearing their sidewalks.", "NTA, but it won't end up the way you want.  They won't be grateful.  They will assume you are a passive aggressive and condescending prick. They aren't going to shovel the snow even if they have the equipment.  Why should they if it will just melt in a few days?  You are going to end up more angry and with the same problems minus the money for one shovel. This is why code enforcement exists.", "NTA. Honestly this is pretty funny. If they're new to the city and not used to snow, it makes sense why they wouldn't have a snow shovel yet. Now they get one for free and your kid is safer because of it. Now just make sure they clear their sidewalks well! I'd give them a bag of salt as well haha.", "I think It's better to report but u do u. NTA anyway", "NTA though a smidge passive aggressive. Frankly I like it \ud83d\ude02", "Why would you buy them a shovel?  If the laws in your area states they\u2019re responsible for shoveling their sidewalk, make that perfectly clear to them. \n\nAfter that, if they still don\u2019t do anything, report them.", "YTA. Stand up for your kid. Your kid got hurt because of their negligence. Anything less than reporting this to the city and forcing them to take action isn\u2019t enough action on your end.", "NTA  You need to start reporting the sidewalk to the city. It is a law for a reason. \n\nWe live a route many kids take to school, our block makes sure to have the walks clear and safe for all that walk on them. many families will take our road knowing it will be a safe route for the kids. It is sad to think they have to walk out of their way in the cold just to keep their kids safe."]}
