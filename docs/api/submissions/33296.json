You're just being a responsible neighbor. Giving them a shovel is a helpful gesture and a subtle hint that they need to take care of their sidewalk. It\u2019s better than having someone get hurt or reporting them, which could have started off your neighborly relationship on the wrong foot.", "Are you from the Upper Midwest of the US? If not, you'd fit in.\n\nThe snow shovel is not a Christmas present really; I'd just drop it off. But NTA for sure?", "Pretty passive aggressive, but still in NTA territory.", "NTA! Its petty and kind of hilarious. However given that its a safety issue, I would just blow them in. My town has some very steep fines for not clearly sidewalks. Thats probably why everyone in my town shovels within the same day. One local business got slapped with so many fines for not clearing their sidewalks.", "NTA, but it won't end up the way you want.  They won't be grateful.  They will assume you are a passive aggressive and condescending prick. They aren't going to shovel the snow even if they have the equipment.  Why should they if it will just melt in a few days?  You are going to end up more angry and with the same problems minus the money for one shovel. This is why code enforcement exists.", "NTA. Honestly this is pretty funny. If they're new to the city and not used to snow, it makes sense why they wouldn't have a snow shovel yet. Now they get one for free and your kid is safer because of it. Now just make sure they clear their sidewalks well! I'd give them a bag of salt as well haha.", "I think It's better to report but u do u. NTA anyway", "NTA though a smidge passive aggressive. Frankly I like it \ud83d\ude02", "Why would you buy them a shovel?  If the laws in your area states they\u2019re responsible for shoveling their sidewalk, make that perfectly clear to them. \n\nAfter that, if they still don\u2019t do anything, report them.", "YTA. Stand up for your kid. Your kid got hurt because of their negligence. Anything less than reporting this to the city and forcing them to take action isn\u2019t enough action on your end.", "NTA  You need to start reporting the sidewalk to the city. It is a law for a reason. \n\nWe live a route many kids take to school, our block makes sure to have the walks clear and safe for all that walk on them. many families will take our road knowing it will be a safe route for the kids. It is sad to think they have to walk out of their way in the cold just to keep their kids safe.", "OP was a good neighbor and tactfully let them know they should shovel their sidewalk, and set them up for success by providing them the tool to do the job. NTA", "It's not petty to take away their future excuses for irresponsibility.\n\nYou save them a fine from the city and possibly any medical claims against their homeowners insurance. NTA", "NTA OMG can you be MY neighbor? I didn't have a snow shovel when I first moved into my house in Indiana (moved from Florida) and we moved in the middle of a snow storm. I felt so guilty when I saw footprints in the snow and realized the awkward path the mailman had to take the next day. With my situation I also couldn't just go out and buy one. I had to order one and wait for it to arrive and find a way to show my kids how to use it \ud83d\ude02Thank you YouTube!", "Nah, a little passive aggressive but I like it. They're lazy.", "NTA. Give them a shovel. When they don't use it, report them to the city.", "I'm waffling between NTA & ESH.\n\nYall, I would be so excited to move to a new area and be gifted a tool! I mean, I'd have to pay someone to use it because medical reasons, but to have neighbors who gift me a useful tool is so cool! If it's not something I've done before, then I'd need a demonstration, please.", "YWBTA for making it a Christmas gift. Don't give people passive-aggressive messages as gifts, plus it might snow again before then. If you want to give it to them, just give it to them now.", "No, your bang on mate \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA - it's their responsibility to shovel, you gave them a give enabling that to happen. If they don't fulfill their obligations then report them to the city.", "NTA but report them the very next time. They had their chance and even got a free shovel. \n\nUnless there's some info missing about disability or elderly or something like that.t", "Hilarious!  This is why justified asshole should be a thing.  In the absence of that option, you are NTA.", "Put a copy of the statute on it.", "NTA. And when they dont shovel, report it.", "YTA. teach your 'kiddo' how to walk. \ud83d\ude02", "Just go shovel it. Do a good deed that directly helps anyone, including your children, that has to walk by. I mean really how long could it take? That\u2019s what I\u2019d do but I\u2019d do just about anything to keep from fighting with my neighbors. It\u2019s not worth it.", "Passive aggressive. I like it. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIt knocks me dead here in western New York that we don't have that kind of law, but we by-Jeebus did in Utah, *and* it was enforced. \n\nPeople still have to get around in the winter! Safely! Yes, one every couple of years we get weather that would excuse not shoveling, but then you go *do it*.", "NTA. Don't forget the bow!", "NTA. If you live in an area that mandates shoveling your sidewalk, you damn well should own a shovel. You're just being thoughtful, right?", "NTA. That is a good gift, though I bet that not having a shovel was just an excuse for being lazy.", "Subtly tell them you don\u2019t want any of the neighbors to report them by not shoveling the walk timely.", "Bring him the snow shovel and a six pack. Make a friend if at all possible, it will make your home life much better.\n\nEdit: NTA", "As long as they use it. I can see them shoveling snow the 1st time and say \"man this is a lot of work and tiring\" and then not do it again as it will just melt in a few days. Which of course is not always true. They also may not know that they can actually be fined for not clearing out the sidewalk. Also I think you can actually sue them if your kid slips and hurts themselves if it's not cleared in a reasonable amount of time.  NTA.", "Honestly, if I was the neighbor I\u2019d be thrilled to get a snow shovel. I didn\u2019t grow up with snow so know nothing about what makes a good snow shovel", "NTA\n\nYou actually did them a favor.  Where I live if you don't shovel your sidewalk the city will eventually fine you.  I think that's the same most everywhere.  You can claim that you are just looking out for their well being.", "Thankfully most of the people in our neighborhood are great about the sidewlks. My problems usually end up being the roads. We end up with little piles of snow in the road crossings and my wheelchair can't get over them. So I'm stuck anyway. :( I can wheel around my block all I like, but I can't cross the street.", "It\u2019s a law because they don\u2019t wanna pay someone to do it.\nYou have zero ownership of the public sidewalks in front of your house, we shouldn\u2019t be required by law to shovel more then our walk way. It\u2019s ridiculous that we\u2019ve been conditioned this way.\nThey want you to get hurt shoveling city property for free.", "That ain't subtle \ud83e\udd23", "But it is petty passive aggressive, which makes even better!", "You don't sound like you think it'll \"just melt in a few days anyway.\"", "Here\u2019s the thing.  If you truly have a medical issue, and it\u2019s a good neighborhood, someone would most likely shovel your sidewalks for you.  That\u2019s how life works in many parts of the country.  If you are just being an asshole, hell hath no passive aggressive fury.", "OP was a good neighbor and tactfully let them know they should shovel their sidewalk, and set them up for success by providing them the tool to do the job instead of just Karening out. Good on them.", "It\u2019s the perfect amount of passive aggressiveness but also neighborly.  how stupid would they look for complaining about how their new neighbor gave them a shovel to help them out?  now, the next time it snows, you can say something and they will have to fully admit to being the assholes that are too lazy to shovel.", "Nope just two mid-30 something\u2019s who work in tech from home\u2026. They have the mountains bike permanently attached to the roof of their cars. Classic I just moved to colorado vibe.", "A week before Christmas, you slap a bow on it and say merry Christmas.", "Everything's a Christmas present if you give it at Christmas.", "SUE THEM, TAKE THE HOUSE !  NOTHING BUT SCORCHED EARTH WILL DO !\n\n/s, obviously", "Yeah he should do the American way and show up with his AK.", "It's on the person to clear the sidewalk.", "This is people pleasing behaviour. Plus if OP does it once, the neighbours will never learn to do it themselves.", "For how long? The next 20 years?", "Sounds like a tort to me", "Good idea! And attach a card with a funny poem about people slipping & suing & that the city will fine them for not clearing the public right of way. Coming from Nosnowland these things would not occur to them", "And none of this is reason to not shovel the sidewalk. Advocate for a change in the law, run for city council, whatever - but shovel your sidewalk.", "You may think it's ridiculous, but it is how things work and how they have to work. You also don't technically own the lower sewer lateral on your home, i.e. the sewer line that extends past the sidewalk to where it connects to the municipal sewer main. However, you are obligated to replace or repair it should any issues arise. Similarly, you are required to keep trees trimmed above the street and sidewalk.\n\nPeople can complain all they want, but you have to think about how ridiculously high property taxes would have to be for the city to afford handling all that additional maintenance. The amount of money it would cost a municipality to handle these things would be insane.\n\nEdited: Repeated word", "It\u2019s like someone hit them over the head with a shovel subtle.", "I am a CO native and still live here, and this comment has me dying \ud83e\udd23  it's waaayyy too true!

My bad. I'm not sure, then, why you went on a little rant about the law. \\*shrug\\*", "Almost like I replied to a post mentioned it\u2019s law, then said why it\u2019s the law. Free labor, and push blame for any accidents on city property to tax paying homeowners."]}
