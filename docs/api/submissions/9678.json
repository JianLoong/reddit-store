You say you are sooooo into these things, but never bothered to mention to your brother (Or presumably others in the family) how precious and valuable they were? Instead you just acted like they were only special to you and ended up with most of them. Seems like the kind of thing that you could have proactively shared waay before so you could both really appreciate them. Instead, you just dropped hints and hoarded the goods. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that you have plans to keep them in the family, an technically no, it\u2019s not your job to tell someone else that what they have is valuable when you want it.

Sure I learned later but I never asked anyone to give them to me unless the other choice was to toss it.", "Nope. Not OPs responsibility to educate everyone on their worth.

So definitely NTA in my book", "Did he not have access to the internet for the last 20 years?", "OP's brother was well into adulthood and twice OP's age when he originally got that gift and she expressed interest. He's had the ability to look find out more info on the gifts for years, but didn't care to do it. Sounds like OP started getting the same gifts as a child and loved then for their sentimental value without knowing their monetary significance. Other members of the family have their gift displayed or in safe keeping so the idea of the gifts being valuable in some since (even just emotional) is already there. OP's brother simply dismissed the gifts and didn't bother to see if this one was something he wanted to pass down to his kids. \n\nOne thing to know is if OP specifically knew that piece was worth so much money before OP got it.

If you knew, what was the reason for not giving such good news to your brother?\n\n\nI think it is wonderful that you valued the gifts from your great aunt since you were so little. You saw sentimental value in them first before money ever came into the picture. You clearly expressed your interest in this this piece when you were a child and your brother was twice your age. He's had every opportunity to look up the value including the fact that other family members have their gifts on display/safely stored. Why hasn't he? Maybe he dismissed the piece or simply didn't care enough to do it?  Your idea to give the gifts back to family with all their information is such a touching thought. I'm glad you care so much to keep everything safely in the family. \n\nYou aren't responsible for informing others that something they have is valuable once you become aware of it. That said, it's kind to inform those close to you that they may be in possession of something of significant valuable once you're privy to that information. I wouldn't give a valuable gift back out of demand, but I would likely have already offered to return it if I'm under the impression that this person I love didn't intentionally give me a such high value gift. You might want the same consideration if something flew under your radar and didn't spark your interest for some reason.\n\nInitial thought of NTA, more info needed.", "Although it's sweet you want to pass it on to his daughter, be careful with it, I reckon he's just gonna take it and sell it. \n\nOP NTA.", "[removed]", "I dont think it was a mean prank,  rather a gag gift.

The brother got it as a wedding gift and passed it on as a wedding gift to OP, in addition to a more traditional gift. This sounds like an inside joke between family at worst not anything mean. He can't demand his gift back because he never checked its value, but it doesn't sound like it was a prank either.", "He gave the gift out of mockery. If it was \u201cI like it but I know you are really into this so you can have it\u201d I would agree with you. Additionally, this is a family heirloom. Wanting it purely to sell and make money off of is not a good enough reason to return something of sentimental value.", "Good housewarming gift, then.", "So who's fault? Not yours obviously. You got all collection fair, someone give it to you willingly, if they not looking on the value, that's their mistakes.", "Do you mind telling us (or just hinting at) what exactly those pieces were? I'm very much into arts and antiques, I understand why you're being vague but curiosity is killing me :D", "No he is definitely that bad. You should hang onto anything you want to pass onto his children until they're adults living out of the house.", "Any idea what brother's wife said if she found out the value?", "[deleted]", "I get what you're saying, but I'm not making assumptions about the brother's motivations. Giggling, laughing, and thinking something is funny could easily be the result of playing an inside joke between family members. Maybe the brother wants to sell it or maybe he would've preferred to keep such a valuable gift from his great aunt and pass it down within his nuclear family. I simply don't know. That doesn't change the fact that I would give a gift back if my loved one gave it to me without realizing it's high value. That's just me and not something anyone is obligated to do. \n\nVoluntarily giving the gift back, if the value was previously unknown, would probably be better for my relationship with my loved one if that relationship is treasured by me. Not doing so could leave said loved one feeling lied to because I withheld valuable information to reduce the chances that he/she would make a decision I didn't like. It wouldn't be AH behavior (info readily available if researched), but it's not exactly the most considerate either.", "I wouldn\u2019t go that far.

NTA", "> he spend over $7k on your wedding?\n\nWhaaat! the brother didn't spend $7K on wedding gifts, he only spent whatever the gift from the registry was worth.  You can't in any cricumstances claim that he spent $6.7K on the collectible that he was gifted and then re-gifted", "NTA but honestly you will be if you follow through with giving the pieces back to those who gave them to you. While it\u2019s a lovely idea, obviously those people didn\u2019t appreciate them in the first place since they were willing to give them to you, so why would you give them back? I am very confident that if you gift that piece to your niece, your brother is going to take it and sell it. It doesn\u2019t matter that your mother would \u201cend him\u201d, he doesn\u2019t seem to care and once it\u2019s sold, it\u2019s gone. I also think other family members you give the pieces back to will follow in your brother\u2019s footsteps since I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be shy talking about the values of the pieces. I would recommend trying to help your nieces and nephews (and your own children if you have/plan to have any) appreciate the pieces for more than just their price tags, then give them the pieces when they are older.", "Can we pleeeeease have an image of link to a similar item? I am dying with curiosity about your curiosities.", "NTA. He's only upset about the value because he wants to sell it. (If he wasn't interested in selling it then the value is of no importance.)\n\nI'd be very careful giving it to your niece when she is young as I suspect your brother may take it from her and sell it then. Perhaps giving it to her as a college graduation gift, or a wedding gift, would be a better & safer choice.", "NTA - it sounds like you really value great aunt's heirlooms for what they are and not for what they're worth, and that's so sweet to see.  \n\nI don't know how old your niece is right now, but maybe you could show her your collection and tell stories about them.  You know, something like who they're from, where they'll be going, why they're important to you and your family.  You could ask her what her favourite thing about each one is or ask her what she thinks the history of each piece is.  Just get her engaged with the collection as a trove of stories and family history rather than a collection with potentially high resale value.  \n\nWhen she gets her gift, make sure she understands that it's for her.  You could even ask her if she'd like for you to keep it with the rest of your collection until she's a bit older or maybe you could make a big day out of cleaning/caring for (not sure if that's something you do or have a professional who does so) the heirloom. \n\nOnce she understands that it has sentimental value and gets attached to it, hopefully it'll dissuade her father from swiping and selling it.  \n\nI'm sure your great aunt is very proud of you and so pleased that you cherish her belongings.", "NTA\n\nWait until the niece is older, you give this back while she is young he will sell it.", "Hey, you\u2019re the a-hole if you don\u2019t post pictures of your collection for us to see!\n\nOtherwise NTA.", "NTA - if you went to an antique store and found a common looking trinket and did a quick google search/ebay and found that its worth 5000 times what they were asking.. would you..  \nA.

I love your idea to gift to the next generation.", "NTA. You never purported to wanting to collect them bc of their value. You wanted them for sentimental reasons. Also your brother is really dumb if he never thought collectible items would be worth something. The whole reason collectible items have high values is BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO COLLECT THEM! The desire to have a complete set of something only produced in finite quantities  is precisely what their value increases. Like basic supply and demand theory. \n\nHe could\u2019ve looked up the value at anytime. You also never stated you knew what the value was and kept it from anyone or lied when asked. He belittled your collection and gave you the item as a GAG gift, not bc he thought it would be precious to you.

He doesn't care about the sentimental value of that gift at all.  He's just interested in the money, and he's pissed off bc he feels stupid now for letting that much money slip though his hands. \n\nPeople can turn ugly when it comes to the possessions of someone who has died.

He gave it away as a gag, not realizing it actually is very precious and valuable. Now he wants it back because he knows it is worth money. Don't give it your niece until she's grown and on her own, he will just take it from her and sell it. I was gifted a gift very much like this. Asked my parents to keep it safe for me until I got into a stable situation. Guess what happened to it? They sold it, then pretended they had no idea what happened to it. They've done this almost all of my things that I ever trusted them with. Now, our relationship is always a business transaction to me.

And they reminded me of ones my great grandma had. Luckily next day I went back and 1 of the porcelain & metal ones was left- I got it, gave it to her. It was ok gift. But when her mom passed away, we made a alter to remember her and 40 day vigil, and she put that orange rose I bought as part of the set up. And now that rose sits with her photo on the cabinet we have. I looked it up and it\u2019s part of a limited hand made set from an English company from early 1900\u2019s and each piece is like $300-600 depending on where/buyer. I do wish I got the other one with it with I had the chance. For $15 a junk old lady antique became a beautiful memorial piece that turned out to be of value. We would never sell it for anything)", " You are definitely NTA.  Congrats on growing into such a considerate young woman.  Are you sure you and your brother are from the same parents??", "Nta.

So when I got married I asked my grandmother if I could have it. It was a \"cheap\" plain satin dress. Honestly I didn't even know it's worth until I had it dry Cleaned. When I used to play in it I would shove it under my grandmothers bed. She used to get so mad at me for getting it dirty. Jokes on me because I had to pay to get it cleaned. When I did the women who ran the shop asked me if I knew how much that dress was worth. I did not know and apparently my grandmothers dress is worth $10,000 dollars. My stepmother found out it's worth. She managed to steal everything that should have gone to me my whole childhood. Not that I would have had problem with sharing with my sisters but I never liked her underhanded was of aquiring everything. She found out the cost and called me to ask me to pass it to my sisters. I said no, it will go to my daughter, neice, or future DIL. The first one to show they love that dress will get it. They have to love it the way I loved it though. They have to see the old, boring Macy's dress like it is the most beautiful dress they have ever seen. If not it can go to their kids. \n\nIt makes me sad that people spend so much time worrying about their relatives possessions based on how much they are worth. From my other grandmother my favorite thing I got from her was my Franciscan Monk Salt and Pepper shakers. They are worthless to everyone but me. She got them because her brother was a Franciscan Monk. He was the coolest uncle ever. He always had laughing mirrors or whoopee cushions. He lived in Israel and gave tours to a ton of famous people like Michael Jackson and Madonna. I loved hanging out with him when he was able to come visit. They remind me of him and I smile every time I see thim.\n\nThis is why would should want something. It should remind you of them and the memories you had with them.

Most of the things you had from your childhood aren't worth a fraction of what other people are getting for them. The main reason is the grading system for these sort of items isn't just about the condition of an item. For example, for paper items like collectible cards or comic books, you don't just care about whether or not the paper still in good condition. You also get graded upon the centering of images, the actual print quality and how well pigments line up on pages, how well it was cut coming out of the machine, how well the ink held up over time. Dozens of other little things will affect the rating of an item, and there is unfathomable distance between a perfect 10 and a 9.5 when it comes to the market. Even today most things aren't perfect tens straight off of the press.

I\u2019ll sell it and buy you something better!\u201d \n\nAnd then your brother buys something for $100 and pockets the rest", "> I would wait until the next generation are adults to start gifting them the items so they are not put back in the homes of those who didn't want them in the first place.\n\nI would do that regardless because they are valuable not only in price but sentimental value and giving a small fragile figurine to a child is not going to end well.", "My first thought was Herend, too!", "Why do you bet this? What makes you think that he is suddenly a thief willing to rob his own family?", "She is giving it to the daughter. \n\nIt's not ok for her dad to steal and sell their child's property,  a family heirloom,  and keep the money himself.", "If he truly believes the gift belongs to him, or convinces himself OP doesn't \"deserve it,\"  he would feel fully justified in taking it back.  \n\nIn his mind, it's not \"stealing.\" It's \"taking my gift back.\"", "Because greedy people suck.\n\nHe will find a way to take it and keep it for himself. \n\nThat's what greedy fuckers do.", "18 year olds can definitely understand. i went theu a fentanyl addiction and have a ring that\u2019s gold/diamonds. my great gpa bought it for my gma when she was 12. she wore it her entire life. she was diagnosed w brain cancer and given 6 months to live, so she gave it to me for my 10th bday. happy to say it\u2019s been almost 12 years and she\u2019s still alive! and i never would\u2019ve ever sold that ring ever no matter what. but that\u2019s isn\u2019t the case for every 18 year old. but what i\u2019m more concerned about in this story is that at 18 she very well could be still living at home. so dad would still have an opportunity to take it. but not every 18 year old is super immature", "NTA\n\nHe treated like trash. You treated it like treasure. If there was no monetary value in the first place he wouldn\u2019t give a shit about it. He\u2019s just greedy.", "NTA\n\nMake sure to give that to your niece when she's 18, though. Or put it in a lockbox. You really don't want your brother \"taking back what's his\"\n\nEven if it doesn't seem likely, it's better to be safe than sorry.", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t give it to your neice as I fear your brother will just sell it\u2026", "NTA.\n\nI think you and his values are very different - his is monetary value and yours is emotional. \n\nEven though it is not wrong to have different values, it is wrong to ask a person to give them back a gift they gave you.\n\nEven though you want to give the figurine to his daughter, maybe make sure he will not have access to it.", "1. You are amazing\n2. Don\u2019t apologise for telling about your passion. \nI think what you are doing is wonderful. A passion build on family love.", "I'm offended for you. He seems like he's not a very sentimental guy. I don't understand people like that. They will always only experience the surface of life. They don't seem to know or care that there's an entire world below the depths.", "NTA. He gave it back thinking it would be funny to give you a gift he thought was worth nothing because he thought you have him s gift worth nothing. It\u2019s no different than getting a painting as a gift. Thinking it\u2019s a shit painting. Then finding out after you sell it it\u2019s s Picasso.", "NTA.  If people don't care to check the value of antiques they're giving away, that's not your fault.  \n\nI rescued an antique Wedgewood cigar box that my nana had literally put in the garbage.  It's not worth much, maybe $150, but it's pretty and I like it, and that's where its real value lies.", "Yes, and it's like this in other parts of the world as well. It's one of the reasons women receive gold wedding jewellery, etc. in Asia.", "Yes, I wonder where they are getting the value from too. People see outrageous asking prices on 1st dibs or a retailer and think their item is worth that much. The reality is often disappointing. Collectibles can fluctuate quite a bit as well.", "That is my thought.  A friend of mine had a son-in-law who found out that her collection of vases were worth several thousand dollars.  He tried to get his hands on them several times but couldn't get the cabinet open.  It had two locks!  One day he finally got his hands on the keys and toke three of the vases and sold them for a considerable amount of money.  He is now in jail for that robbery  and she got her vases back from the pawn shop.", "If he didn't value the piece, he didn't value it. It looked like it wasn't worth money, so he discarded it by giving it away. The research is on him. The caring is on him. If he is just about mammon and lucre, then that's on him. \n\nSome people are so rich, all they have is money.", "NTA\n\nHe gifted it to you as a *prank gift* ffs.  At your wedding, no less.\n\nHis loss.", "NTA. Brother only sees dollar signs and wants to sell it. He and others gave the items to you so they are yours now. Just be glad they didn't throw them away or give them to goodwill.", "NTA, he's the one who chose to give it to you. It would be different if you'd gone ahead and sold it to keep the money for yourself, but you're keeping it because you genuinely love it.\n\nAlso, I'd recommend holding off on giving it to your niece until she's older. If you give it to her whilst she's still a child, your brother will probably take it off of her and sell it.\n\nI think it's sweet that you're keeping your great aunt's memory alive through her belongings :)", "If that one piece is worth that much,  the whole collection is worth a great deal. It's a pity you clued your brother in on that fact since he's obviously more materialistic. I hope the cabinet locks since not only is he a risk, but anyone he tells.", "I must admit my Autie gifted me pieces when I was a teen and my parents never even considered this! (OMG).  And we weren't rich.  \nThat being said when my Great Aunt left me jewelry that had some value - they broke the Necklace set into three - so each of their daughters could have necklaces and earrings from it.  I'm not unhappy - I'm glad to share with my sisters.  But I'm a little salty that my Great Aunt's final wishes - were totally disregarded.  (My sisters are entirely unaware to this day that the piece was left to me - But my Auntie was a strong and independent woman she knew her own mind when she made out her will).", "I was going to guess Lladro, they can easily fetch 4 figures for the right collector.", "Valuable items taken deceptively from family members \ud83d\ude02\n\nReddit\u2019s opinion seems to be \u2018you keep doing it OP, it\u2019s a beautiful thing\u2019"]}
