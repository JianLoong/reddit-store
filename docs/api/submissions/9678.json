Well done OP. NTA.", "Info is your brother in financial difficulties?", "YTA.  You say you are sooooo into these things, but never bothered to mention to your brother (Or presumably others in the family) how precious and valuable they were? Instead you just acted like they were only special to you and ended up with most of them. Seems like the kind of thing that you could have proactively shared waay before so you could both really appreciate them. Instead, you just dropped hints and hoarded the goods. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that you have plans to keep them in the family, an technically no, it\u2019s not your job to tell someone else that what they have is valuable when you want it. But this wasn\u2019t a pawn shop, this was your brother, and the rest of your family. Look hard in the mirror and ask yourself why you never told anyone they were so valuable. That\u2019ll answer your AITA question.", "INFO\n\nWere the pieces passed on as a financial inheritance, or were they intended to remain in the family for purely sentimental reasons", "NTA.

I think he feels dumb for not looking it up.", "My mom would end him.", "I have thought these things were awesome since I was five and he was twenty. Do you think I knew what they were worth?  Sure I learned later but I never asked anyone to give them to me unless the other choice was to toss it.", "Nope. Not OPs responsibility to educate everyone on their worth. OP loves these things for what they are and not their monetary worth. If that was the case they would have sold them and not be planning to give them back. So definitely NTA in my book", "Did he not have access to the internet for the last 20 years?", "OP's brother was well into adulthood and twice OP's age when he originally got that gift and she expressed interest. He's had the ability to look find out more info on the gifts for years, but didn't care to do it. Sounds like OP started getting the same gifts as a child and loved then for their sentimental value without knowing their monetary significance. Other members of the family have their gift displayed or in safe keeping so the idea of the gifts being valuable in some since (even just emotional) is already there. OP's brother simply dismissed the gifts and didn't bother to see if this one was something he wanted to pass down to his kids. \n\nOne thing to know is if OP specifically knew that piece was worth so much money before OP got it. An item isn't always worth a lot of money just because people collect them. Some antiques are quite valuable, others aren't worth so much.", "Mine was just given as a gift.

Do you now know the monetary value of the pieces currently possessed by your family members?

Don\u2019t give it back, he will sell it and those pieces will be lost to your family.", "MORE INFO NEEDED: \nDid you know the value before you received it as as a gift? If you knew, what was the reason for not giving such good news to your brother?\n\n\nI think it is wonderful that you valued the gifts from your great aunt since you were so little. You saw sentimental value in them first before money ever came into the picture. You clearly expressed your interest in this this piece when you were a child and your brother was twice your age. He's had every opportunity to look up the value including the fact that other family members have their gifts on display/safely stored. Why hasn't he? Maybe he dismissed the piece or simply didn't care enough to do it?  Your idea to give the gifts back to family with all their information is such a touching thought. I'm glad you care so much to keep everything safely in the family. \n\nYou aren't responsible for informing others that something they have is valuable once you become aware of it. That said, it's kind to inform those close to you that they may be in possession of something of significant valuable once you're privy to that information. I wouldn't give a valuable gift back out of demand, but I would likely have already offered to return it if I'm under the impression that this person I love didn't intentionally give me a such high value gift. You might want the same consideration if something flew under your radar and didn't spark your interest for some reason.\n\nInitial thought of NTA, more info needed.", "Although it's sweet you want to pass it on to his daughter, be careful with it, I reckon he's just gonna take it and sell it. \n\nOP NTA.", "[removed]", "I dont think it was a mean prank,  rather a gag gift. He even gave the actual gift she asked for. I know hes not being nice to ask for it back, but I think hes being dumb than being mean.", "OP expressed how beautiful the piece was many years ago and has requested any pieces her family members no longer want. The brother got it as a wedding gift and passed it on as a wedding gift to OP, in addition to a more traditional gift. This sounds like an inside joke between family at worst not anything mean. He can't demand his gift back because he never checked its value, but it doesn't sound like it was a prank either.", "He gave the gift out of mockery. If it was \u201cI like it but I know you are really into this so you can have it\u201d I would agree with you. Additionally, this is a family heirloom. Wanting it purely to sell and make money off of is not a good enough reason to return something of sentimental value.", "Good housewarming gift, then.", "So who's fault? Not yours obviously. You got all collection fair, someone give it to you willingly, if they not looking on the value, that's their mistakes.", "Do you mind telling us (or just hinting at) what exactly those pieces were? I'm very much into arts and antiques, I understand why you're being vague but curiosity is killing me :D", "No he is definitely that bad. You should hang onto anything you want to pass onto his children until they're adults living out of the house.", "Any idea what brother's wife said if she found out the value?", "INFO: So you\u2019re perfectly fine accepting about $6700 (on top of a gift from your registry) from your brother? Your brother is in such a good spot financially that you think it\u2019s appropriate he spend over $7k on your wedding?", "I get what you're saying, but I'm not making assumptions about the brother's motivations. Giggling, laughing, and thinking something is funny could easily be the result of playing an inside joke between family members. Maybe the brother wants to sell it or maybe he would've preferred to keep such a valuable gift from his great aunt and pass it down within his nuclear family. I simply don't know. That doesn't change the fact that I would give a gift back if my loved one gave it to me without realizing it's high value. That's just me and not something anyone is obligated to do. \n\nVoluntarily giving the gift back, if the value was previously unknown, would probably be better for my relationship with my loved one if that relationship is treasured by me. Not doing so could leave said loved one feeling lied to because I withheld valuable information to reduce the chances that he/she would make a decision I didn't like. It wouldn't be AH behavior (info readily available if researched), but it's not exactly the most considerate either.", "I wouldn\u2019t go that far. I know the average sell price of all my Pok\u00e9mon cards, but I\u2019m getting buried with those suckers.", "The thing about figurines like that is he'll never ever get 6k for it.  He's unlikely to get a grand.  Stuff like that is all about condition and about finding the right buyer under the right circumstances.", "They aren't meant to be sold. They're items to be inherited abd lovingly passed on. \n\n It's his fault for not appreciating family heirlooms.", "dk if you\u2019re slow or not but the brother GAVE it to her and unless he\u2019s dumber than a box of rocks who wouldn\u2019t check if it\u2019s worth something it\u2019s just like my grandmas \u201cfine china cabinet\u201d YK ITS WORTH SOMETHING. he was an adult when he received it he could literally look it up, he was never interested enough with the gift to do it. he giggled when he gave her the gift like he was pulling one on her. now he can giggle his dumb ass back home cuz he\u2019s not getting it back. NTA", "> he spend over $7k on your wedding?\n\nWhaaat! the brother didn't spend $7K on wedding gifts, he only spent whatever the gift from the registry was worth.  You can't in any cricumstances claim that he spent $6.7K on the collectible that he was gifted and then re-gifted"]}
