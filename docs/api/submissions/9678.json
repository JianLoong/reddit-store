She just grew up in Eastern Europe right after WWII.  \n\nOne of the weird things about her was that she would give her old belongings as gifts for weddings and important birthdays.  I still have the music box she gave me for my First Communion.  \nWhen we saw family I would always ask to see their pieces.  A few of my aunts had them displayed in a china cabinet or out somewhere safe.  A few had them collecting dust in a box.   I made sure they knew that if the day ever came that they wanted to downsize or something I would appreciate a chance to grab it for my collection. Some of my cousins took me up on the offer and I ended up with six extra pieces for my room.  \n\nWhen I moved out I made sure that every single part of my collection was safely wrapped and packed.   They are my little treasures.  I know it's weird.  \n\nSorry for being so long winded.  I just love talking about that stuff.   \n\nI'm about 15 years younger than my eldest brother and he knows about my collection.  When he got married I was 14. At his gift opening I saw he got one of her usual gifts.   I also saw his wife's face.

I thought he might like to pass it on to his kid one day.   \n\nWhen my aunt passed away she left me the last of her collection.  Three pieces that were a set.   \n\nI got married last September. My niece, his daughter, was my flower girl.  \n\nAt my gift opening I could almost hear him giggle when I opened my gift from them.  It was the piece from our great aunt.  He thought it was super funny.  Then he gave us our \"real\" gift from our registry.  \n\nI thanked him profusely for both.  \n\nHe came over the other day and saw my collection in my china cabinet I inherited. He asked me why I was so fascinated with this stuff.  I told him that I thought it was amazing and that lots of people collected it.  He called bullshit and started looking it up.  \n\nThe figurine he gave me is worth about  $6,700.  \n\nHe said that I was a dick for not telling him what it was worth.  He wants it back.  I said  that my husband and I were going to give back every piece I got from family as a gift for a special occasion.  I already planned to give that piece to my niece for her first communion. Along with a little booklet of information about my aunt and the value of the piece so they appreciated it.  I know exactly who I got each piece from. And they are all going back to that family. \n\nHe says I'm being mean accepting a gift from him that is worth so much.  \n\nI asked him if he ever bothered looking up.the value of what he was giving me.

Didn\u2019t like the gift and was pretty much pulling a mean prank by regifting it until he knew the value? Jeez. He\u2019s the AH", "NTA\n\nIt's not your fault if they think it's trash and just give it away. I wouldn't give it to my nieces and nephews until they're old enough to understand the value and understand the historic importance of the pieces.", "You're amazing, your aunt would be proud of you. Well done OP. NTA.", "Info is your brother in financial difficulties?", "YTA.  You say you are sooooo into these things, but never bothered to mention to your brother (Or presumably others in the family) how precious and valuable they were? Instead you just acted like they were only special to you and ended up with most of them. Seems like the kind of thing that you could have proactively shared waay before so you could both really appreciate them. Instead, you just dropped hints and hoarded the goods. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that you have plans to keep them in the family, an technically no, it\u2019s not your job to tell someone else that what they have is valuable when you want it. But this wasn\u2019t a pawn shop, this was your brother, and the rest of your family. Look hard in the mirror and ask yourself why you never told anyone they were so valuable. That\u2019ll answer your AITA question.", "INFO\n\nWere the pieces passed on as a financial inheritance, or were they intended to remain in the family for purely sentimental reasons", "NTA. He was *giggling* at you when he gave you that wedding gift, like he was pulling a prank on you. I don\u2019t fault him for not being into great-aunt\u2019s collection when he was younger, but certainly as an adult he could have looked up the markings himself or even ask you what you knew about it. I think it\u2019s very sweet of you to regift them back to the families that gave them to you.", "He's not that bad.  I think he feels dumb for not looking it up.", "My mom would end him.", "I have thought these things were awesome since I was five and he was twenty. Do you think I knew what they were worth?  Sure I learned later but I never asked anyone to give them to me unless the other choice was to toss it.", "Nope. Not OPs responsibility to educate everyone on their worth. OP loves these things for what they are and not their monetary worth. If that was the case they would have sold them and not be planning to give them back. So definitely NTA in my book", "Did he not have access to the internet for the last 20 years?", "OP's brother was well into adulthood and twice OP's age when he originally got that gift and she expressed interest. He's had the ability to look find out more info on the gifts for years, but didn't care to do it. Sounds like OP started getting the same gifts as a child and loved then for their sentimental value without knowing their monetary significance. Other members of the family have their gift displayed or in safe keeping so the idea of the gifts being valuable in some since (even just emotional) is already there. OP's brother simply dismissed the gifts and didn't bother to see if this one was something he wanted to pass down to his kids. \n\nOne thing to know is if OP specifically knew that piece was worth so much money before OP got it. An item isn't always worth a lot of money just because people collect them. Some antiques are quite valuable, others aren't worth so much.", "Mine was just given as a gift.  No money was ever mentioned.   Same for any time I saw one given as a gift.", "He is that bad. He'll probably sell it.\n\nThere's no reason to care about the sell price otherwise.", "As she should! \ud83d\ude02", "LoL", "I love that you valued these gifts and saw the beauty in them even at such a young age. Do you now know the monetary value of the pieces currently possessed by your family members? If so, how long have you known and have you shared the value with them or shared the fact that extra care should be taken because some items may be valuable? Did you already know the value of the specific piece your niece & brother gave you in September?", "I like to know the sale price of things even if I never plan to sell it. Also insurance likes to know what stuff is worth."]}
