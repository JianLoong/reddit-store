You say you are sooooo into these things, but never bothered to mention to your brother (Or presumably others in the family) how precious and valuable they were? Instead you just acted like they were only special to you and ended up with most of them. Seems like the kind of thing that you could have proactively shared waay before so you could both really appreciate them. Instead, you just dropped hints and hoarded the goods. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that you have plans to keep them in the family, an technically no, it\u2019s not your job to tell someone else that what they have is valuable when you want it.

So definitely NTA in my book", "Did he not have access to the internet for the last 20 years?", "OP's brother was well into adulthood and twice OP's age when he originally got that gift and she expressed interest. He's had the ability to look find out more info on the gifts for years, but didn't care to do it. Sounds like OP started getting the same gifts as a child and loved then for their sentimental value without knowing their monetary significance. Other members of the family have their gift displayed or in safe keeping so the idea of the gifts being valuable in some since (even just emotional) is already there. OP's brother simply dismissed the gifts and didn't bother to see if this one was something he wanted to pass down to his kids. \n\nOne thing to know is if OP specifically knew that piece was worth so much money before OP got it. An item isn't always worth a lot of money just because people collect them. Some antiques are quite valuable, others aren't worth so much.", "Mine was just given as a gift.

If you knew, what was the reason for not giving such good news to your brother?\n\n\nI think it is wonderful that you valued the gifts from your great aunt since you were so little. You saw sentimental value in them first before money ever came into the picture. You clearly expressed your interest in this this piece when you were a child and your brother was twice your age. He's had every opportunity to look up the value including the fact that other family members have their gifts on display/safely stored. Why hasn't he? Maybe he dismissed the piece or simply didn't care enough to do it?  Your idea to give the gifts back to family with all their information is such a touching thought. I'm glad you care so much to keep everything safely in the family. \n\nYou aren't responsible for informing others that something they have is valuable once you become aware of it. That said, it's kind to inform those close to you that they may be in possession of something of significant valuable once you're privy to that information. I wouldn't give a valuable gift back out of demand, but I would likely have already offered to return it if I'm under the impression that this person I love didn't intentionally give me a such high value gift. You might want the same consideration if something flew under your radar and didn't spark your interest for some reason.\n\nInitial thought of NTA, more info needed.", "Although it's sweet you want to pass it on to his daughter, be careful with it, I reckon he's just gonna take it and sell it. \n\nOP NTA.", "[removed]", "I dont think it was a mean prank,  rather a gag gift.

The brother got it as a wedding gift and passed it on as a wedding gift to OP, in addition to a more traditional gift. This sounds like an inside joke between family at worst not anything mean. He can't demand his gift back because he never checked its value, but it doesn't sound like it was a prank either.", "He gave the gift out of mockery. If it was \u201cI like it but I know you are really into this so you can have it\u201d I would agree with you. Additionally, this is a family heirloom. Wanting it purely to sell and make money off of is not a good enough reason to return something of sentimental value.", "Good housewarming gift, then.", "So who's fault? Not yours obviously. You got all collection fair, someone give it to you willingly, if they not looking on the value, that's their mistakes.", "Do you mind telling us (or just hinting at) what exactly those pieces were? I'm very much into arts and antiques, I understand why you're being vague but curiosity is killing me :D", "No he is definitely that bad. You should hang onto anything you want to pass onto his children until they're adults living out of the house.", "Any idea what brother's wife said if she found out the value?", "INFO: So you\u2019re perfectly fine accepting about $6700 (on top of a gift from your registry) from your brother? Your brother is in such a good spot financially that you think it\u2019s appropriate he spend over $7k on your wedding?", "I get what you're saying, but I'm not making assumptions about the brother's motivations. Giggling, laughing, and thinking something is funny could easily be the result of playing an inside joke between family members. Maybe the brother wants to sell it or maybe he would've preferred to keep such a valuable gift from his great aunt and pass it down within his nuclear family. I simply don't know. That doesn't change the fact that I would give a gift back if my loved one gave it to me without realizing it's high value. That's just me and not something anyone is obligated to do. \n\nVoluntarily giving the gift back, if the value was previously unknown, would probably be better for my relationship with my loved one if that relationship is treasured by me. Not doing so could leave said loved one feeling lied to because I withheld valuable information to reduce the chances that he/she would make a decision I didn't like. It wouldn't be AH behavior (info readily available if researched), but it's not exactly the most considerate either.", "I wouldn\u2019t go that far.

He's unlikely to get a grand.  Stuff like that is all about condition and about finding the right buyer under the right circumstances.", "They aren't meant to be sold.

NTA", "> he spend over $7k on your wedding?\n\nWhaaat! the brother didn't spend $7K on wedding gifts, he only spent whatever the gift from the registry was worth.  You can't in any cricumstances claim that he spent $6.7K on the collectible that he was gifted and then re-gifted", "NTA but honestly you will be if you follow through with giving the pieces back to those who gave them to you. While it\u2019s a lovely idea, obviously those people didn\u2019t appreciate them in the first place since they were willing to give them to you, so why would you give them back? I am very confident that if you gift that piece to your niece, your brother is going to take it and sell it. It doesn\u2019t matter that your mother would \u201cend him\u201d, he doesn\u2019t seem to care and once it\u2019s sold, it\u2019s gone. I also think other family members you give the pieces back to will follow in your brother\u2019s footsteps since I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be shy talking about the values of the pieces. I would recommend trying to help your nieces and nephews (and your own children if you have/plan to have any) appreciate the pieces for more than just their price tags, then give them the pieces when they are older.", "Can we pleeeeease have an image of link to a similar item? I am dying with curiosity about your curiosities.", "NTA. He's only upset about the value because he wants to sell it. (If he wasn't interested in selling it then the value is of no importance.)\n\nI'd be very careful giving it to your niece when she is young as I suspect your brother may take it from her and sell it then. Perhaps giving it to her as a college graduation gift, or a wedding gift, would be a better & safer choice.", "NTA - it sounds like you really value great aunt's heirlooms for what they are and not for what they're worth, and that's so sweet to see.  \n\nI don't know how old your niece is right now, but maybe you could show her your collection and tell stories about them.  You know, something like who they're from, where they'll be going, why they're important to you and your family.  You could ask her what her favourite thing about each one is or ask her what she thinks the history of each piece is.  Just get her engaged with the collection as a trove of stories and family history rather than a collection with potentially high resale value.  \n\nWhen she gets her gift, make sure she understands that it's for her.  You could even ask her if she'd like for you to keep it with the rest of your collection until she's a bit older or maybe you could make a big day out of cleaning/caring for (not sure if that's something you do or have a professional who does so) the heirloom. \n\nOnce she understands that it has sentimental value and gets attached to it, hopefully it'll dissuade her father from swiping and selling it.  \n\nI'm sure your great aunt is very proud of you and so pleased that you cherish her belongings.", "NTA\n\nWait until the niece is older, you give this back while she is young he will sell it.", "Hey, you\u2019re the a-hole if you don\u2019t post pictures of your collection for us to see!\n\nOtherwise NTA.", "NTA - if you went to an antique store and found a common looking trinket and did a quick google search/ebay and found that its worth 5000 times what they were asking.. would you..  \nA.

I love your idea to gift to the next generation.", "NTA. You never purported to wanting to collect them bc of their value. You wanted them for sentimental reasons. Also your brother is really dumb if he never thought collectible items would be worth something. The whole reason collectible items have high values is BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO COLLECT THEM! The desire to have a complete set of something only produced in finite quantities  is precisely what their value increases. Like basic supply and demand theory. \n\nHe could\u2019ve looked up the value at anytime. You also never stated you knew what the value was and kept it from anyone or lied when asked.

Don't give it your niece until she's grown and on her own, he will just take it from her and sell it. I was gifted a gift very much like this. Asked my parents to keep it safe for me until I got into a stable situation. Guess what happened to it? They sold it, then pretended they had no idea what happened to it. They've done this almost all of my things that I ever trusted them with. Now, our relationship is always a business transaction to me.

And they reminded me of ones my great grandma had. Luckily next day I went back and 1 of the porcelain & metal ones was left- I got it, gave it to her. It was ok gift. But when her mom passed away, we made a alter to remember her and 40 day vigil, and she put that orange rose I bought as part of the set up. And now that rose sits with her photo on the cabinet we have. I looked it up and it\u2019s part of a limited hand made set from an English company from early 1900\u2019s and each piece is like $300-600 depending on where/buyer. I do wish I got the other one with it with I had the chance. For $15 a junk old lady antique became a beautiful memorial piece that turned out to be of value. We would never sell it for anything)", " You are definitely NTA.  Congrats on growing into such a considerate young woman.  Are you sure you and your brother are from the same parents??", "Nta.

When I used to play in it I would shove it under my grandmothers bed. She used to get so mad at me for getting it dirty. Jokes on me because I had to pay to get it cleaned. When I did the women who ran the shop asked me if I knew how much that dress was worth. I did not know and apparently my grandmothers dress is worth $10,000 dollars. My stepmother found out it's worth. She managed to steal everything that should have gone to me my whole childhood. Not that I would have had problem with sharing with my sisters but I never liked her underhanded was of aquiring everything. She found out the cost and called me to ask me to pass it to my sisters. I said no, it will go to my daughter, neice, or future DIL. The first one to show they love that dress will get it. They have to love it the way I loved it though. They have to see the old, boring Macy's dress like it is the most beautiful dress they have ever seen. If not it can go to their kids. \n\nIt makes me sad that people spend so much time worrying about their relatives possessions based on how much they are worth. From my other grandmother my favorite thing I got from her was my Franciscan Monk Salt and Pepper shakers. They are worthless to everyone but me. She got them because her brother was a Franciscan Monk. He was the coolest uncle ever. He always had laughing mirrors or whoopee cushions. He lived in Israel and gave tours to a ton of famous people like Michael Jackson and Madonna. I loved hanging out with him when he was able to come visit. They remind me of him and I smile every time I see thim.\n\nThis is why would should want something. It should remind you of them and the memories you had with them.

Most of the things you had from your childhood aren't worth a fraction of what other people are getting for them. The main reason is the grading system for these sort of items isn't just about the condition of an item. For example, for paper items like collectible cards or comic books, you don't just care about whether or not the paper still in good condition. You also get graded upon the centering of images, the actual print quality and how well pigments line up on pages, how well it was cut coming out of the machine, how well the ink held up over time. Dozens of other little things will affect the rating of an item, and there is unfathomable distance between a perfect 10 and a 9.5 when it comes to the market. Even today most things aren't perfect tens straight off of the press.
