You say you are sooooo into these things, but never bothered to mention to your brother (Or presumably others in the family) how precious and valuable they were? Instead you just acted like they were only special to you and ended up with most of them. Seems like the kind of thing that you could have proactively shared waay before so you could both really appreciate them. Instead, you just dropped hints and hoarded the goods. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that you have plans to keep them in the family, an technically no, it\u2019s not your job to tell someone else that what they have is valuable when you want it.

So definitely NTA in my book", "Did he not have access to the internet for the last 20 years?", "OP's brother was well into adulthood and twice OP's age when he originally got that gift and she expressed interest. He's had the ability to look find out more info on the gifts for years, but didn't care to do it. Sounds like OP started getting the same gifts as a child and loved then for their sentimental value without knowing their monetary significance. Other members of the family have their gift displayed or in safe keeping so the idea of the gifts being valuable in some since (even just emotional) is already there. OP's brother simply dismissed the gifts and didn't bother to see if this one was something he wanted to pass down to his kids. \n\nOne thing to know is if OP specifically knew that piece was worth so much money before OP got it. An item isn't always worth a lot of money just because people collect them. Some antiques are quite valuable, others aren't worth so much.", "Mine was just given as a gift.

If you knew, what was the reason for not giving such good news to your brother?\n\n\nI think it is wonderful that you valued the gifts from your great aunt since you were so little. You saw sentimental value in them first before money ever came into the picture. You clearly expressed your interest in this this piece when you were a child and your brother was twice your age. He's had every opportunity to look up the value including the fact that other family members have their gifts on display/safely stored. Why hasn't he? Maybe he dismissed the piece or simply didn't care enough to do it?  Your idea to give the gifts back to family with all their information is such a touching thought. I'm glad you care so much to keep everything safely in the family. \n\nYou aren't responsible for informing others that something they have is valuable once you become aware of it. That said, it's kind to inform those close to you that they may be in possession of something of significant valuable once you're privy to that information. I wouldn't give a valuable gift back out of demand, but I would likely have already offered to return it if I'm under the impression that this person I love didn't intentionally give me a such high value gift. You might want the same consideration if something flew under your radar and didn't spark your interest for some reason.\n\nInitial thought of NTA, more info needed.", "Although it's sweet you want to pass it on to his daughter, be careful with it, I reckon he's just gonna take it and sell it. \n\nOP NTA.", "[removed]", "I dont think it was a mean prank,  rather a gag gift.

The brother got it as a wedding gift and passed it on as a wedding gift to OP, in addition to a more traditional gift. This sounds like an inside joke between family at worst not anything mean. He can't demand his gift back because he never checked its value, but it doesn't sound like it was a prank either.", "He gave the gift out of mockery. If it was \u201cI like it but I know you are really into this so you can have it\u201d I would agree with you. Additionally, this is a family heirloom. Wanting it purely to sell and make money off of is not a good enough reason to return something of sentimental value.", "Good housewarming gift, then.", "So who's fault? Not yours obviously. You got all collection fair, someone give it to you willingly, if they not looking on the value, that's their mistakes.", "Do you mind telling us (or just hinting at) what exactly those pieces were? I'm very much into arts and antiques, I understand why you're being vague but curiosity is killing me :D", "No he is definitely that bad. You should hang onto anything you want to pass onto his children until they're adults living out of the house.", "Any idea what brother's wife said if she found out the value?", "INFO: So you\u2019re perfectly fine accepting about $6700 (on top of a gift from your registry) from your brother? Your brother is in such a good spot financially that you think it\u2019s appropriate he spend over $7k on your wedding?", "I get what you're saying, but I'm not making assumptions about the brother's motivations. Giggling, laughing, and thinking something is funny could easily be the result of playing an inside joke between family members. Maybe the brother wants to sell it or maybe he would've preferred to keep such a valuable gift from his great aunt and pass it down within his nuclear family. I simply don't know. That doesn't change the fact that I would give a gift back if my loved one gave it to me without realizing it's high value. That's just me and not something anyone is obligated to do. \n\nVoluntarily giving the gift back, if the value was previously unknown, would probably be better for my relationship with my loved one if that relationship is treasured by me. Not doing so could leave said loved one feeling lied to because I withheld valuable information to reduce the chances that he/she would make a decision I didn't like. It wouldn't be AH behavior (info readily available if researched), but it's not exactly the most considerate either.", "I wouldn\u2019t go that far.

He's unlikely to get a grand.  Stuff like that is all about condition and about finding the right buyer under the right circumstances.", "They aren't meant to be sold.

NTA", "> he spend over $7k on your wedding?\n\nWhaaat! the brother didn't spend $7K on wedding gifts, he only spent whatever the gift from the registry was worth.  You can't in any cricumstances claim that he spent $6.7K on the collectible that he was gifted and then re-gifted", "NTA but honestly you will be if you follow through with giving the pieces back to those who gave them to you. While it\u2019s a lovely idea, obviously those people didn\u2019t appreciate them in the first place since they were willing to give them to you, so why would you give them back? I am very confident that if you gift that piece to your niece, your brother is going to take it and sell it. It doesn\u2019t matter that your mother would \u201cend him\u201d, he doesn\u2019t seem to care and once it\u2019s sold, it\u2019s gone. I also think other family members you give the pieces back to will follow in your brother\u2019s footsteps since I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be shy talking about the values of the pieces. I would recommend trying to help your nieces and nephews (and your own children if you have/plan to have any) appreciate the pieces for more than just their price tags, then give them the pieces when they are older.", "Can we pleeeeease have an image of link to a similar item? I am dying with curiosity about your curiosities.", "NTA. He's only upset about the value because he wants to sell it. (If he wasn't interested in selling it then the value is of no importance.)\n\nI'd be very careful giving it to your niece when she is young as I suspect your brother may take it from her and sell it then. Perhaps giving it to her as a college graduation gift, or a wedding gift, would be a better & safer choice.", "NTA - it sounds like you really value great aunt's heirlooms for what they are and not for what they're worth, and that's so sweet to see.  \n\nI don't know how old your niece is right now, but maybe you could show her your collection and tell stories about them.  You know, something like who they're from, where they'll be going, why they're important to you and your family.  You could ask her what her favourite thing about each one is or ask her what she thinks the history of each piece is.  Just get her engaged with the collection as a trove of stories and family history rather than a collection with potentially high resale value.  \n\nWhen she gets her gift, make sure she understands that it's for her.  You could even ask her if she'd like for you to keep it with the rest of your collection until she's a bit older or maybe you could make a big day out of cleaning/caring for (not sure if that's something you do or have a professional who does so) the heirloom. \n\nOnce she understands that it has sentimental value and gets attached to it, hopefully it'll dissuade her father from swiping and selling it.  \n\nI'm sure your great aunt is very proud of you and so pleased that you cherish her belongings.", "NTA\n\nWait until the niece is older, you give this back while she is young he will sell it.", "Hey, you\u2019re the a-hole if you don\u2019t post pictures of your collection for us to see!\n\nOtherwise NTA.", "NTA - if you went to an antique store and found a common looking trinket and did a quick google search/ebay and found that its worth 5000 times what they were asking.. would you..  \nA.

If everyone had been saving them and collecting them, they'd be worthless now. We've found that out with so many toys and comics since the speculator markets opened up.\n\nI also can't imagine how sad a childhood would be if every cool thing you had was look but don't touch. Awesome toys you can never take out of the packaging and play with. You can't lay in bed with a flashlight and read your comic, or stuff it in a backpack and take it to school. No, you have to first dust the special table, then wash and dry your hands really good, and then you can carefully take it out of the plastic and very gently turn the pages as you look at them, being careful to keep your hands on the page margins and not the ink. \n\nHalf the fun of reading Batman is being super anxious that you might crinkle a page or even, god forbid, tear it.\n\nI know there are some kids who actually would enjoy collecting and having toys (my niece was like that, and I kept trying to explain to my sister that she valued something different in the toy), but most kids just aren't. \n\nI think it's also best to teach kids to have things because they love them, whether they love playing with them or collecting them or microwaving them or whatever. But don't teach them to invest in their passions by speculating. That's just toxic capitalism. Speculation ruins everything it touches, be it baseball cards or comics or video games or action figures. It just creates a bunch of leeches that syphon money away from the hobby to pad their own pockets. It makes it so creators can't get funding and enthusiasts get priced out of what they love."]}
