You are the parents and consistent boundaries are crucial for kids. Your 3-year-old is meant to test them. Your in-laws aren\u2019t.  If MIL is as sensitive as you say she is, she won\u2019t hold to this unfair ultimatum she\u2019s given you.

Unless you're abusing or mistreating your child, the grandparents have absolutely no right to tell you how to raise your children. She's out of line and 1000% emotionally blackmailing you. As a mom I'm furious on your behalf. How dare she?\n\nStand your ground. This isn't some arbitrary rule, this is for your child's health--it is not in a 3yo's best interests to be allowed to refuse nutritious food and live on cookies.\n\nI'd give grandma what she wants, and that's no more meals around kiddo. Meet up at a park or away from meal and snack times so that your child still has a close positive relationship with the grands, but remove food from the relationship since they're clearly not going to follow your honestly quite reasonable rules about it. 3 bites isn't the end of the universe, you're not telling your child that they can't leave the table until they clean their plate, you're not putting your kid to bed hungry, you're not beating your kid ffs, you just want to get some nutrition in that tummy before junk food! Grandma really has no leg to stand on here.\n\nAnd OP? Your husband needs to get involved in this ASAP. This is the rule you BOTH agreed upon. It's wrong for him to make you be the bad guy here.

You are absolutely right to place a set of rules for your daughter and she will cry her lungs out to get what she wants.  It only takes one slip and if anyone give in to the child's cries of blackmail, she will remember and it will be that much more difficult to adjust her behavior.\n\nI am sorry you have to go against your in-laws in this matter.  They should follow you and your husband's rules in raising your daughter.  Maybe you could talk with the inlaws and tell them the rules are for 3's own good (not a picky eater = good nutrition), but I have a feeling that they might not listen to reason.\n\nI'm getting off track.  Let me get back to your question.  No, you are absolutely NTA in having your daughter follow your rules.  In addition, she should follow those rules even if you are not around.\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA\n\nShe is your child and children need consistency, if grandma wants to break the rules, then you don't go for dinner.\n\n\"I'm sorry, MIL.

You should speak to a dietician to help your 3 year old, not put deserts on a pedestal that she has to earn. She's clearly capable of knowing what she does and doesnt like, she isnt binging on sweets as shes able to prioritise sleep over them. It feels like your food rules are not helping her to have a healthy relationship with food but are reinforcing negative ones. \n\nWhat is the actual problem that your in-laws are creating? They give your daughter two cookies that shes too tired to eat? \n\nYou really need to reconsider your approach to food and your daughter. This bites rule clearly isnt working for her, and you've said, she is already only taking very small bites. Your rule doesn't work.

Only 1/2 listen to this.

It's hard to tell your parents what to do and how to act.\n\nBut sometimes the peace can't be kept and he needs to make a stand, and this is one of those times. Making you into the bad guy is not keeping the peace, it's choosing his parents' comfort over your relationship with your own child. That is not fair and it's not right. As your daughter gets older that's going to strain her relationship with you and that's not fair either. You deserve to have a husband who has your back, OP, and that means HIM telling his mother to stop with the emotional manipulation and passive-aggressive \"ask your mommy cuz it makes me sad to say no\" bullshit.\n\nWhen your husband stood up with you at your wedding and took those vows, he committed to prioritize you and the family you created together above all others and yes that includes putting you and your family above his parents. And he is your child's father, which means he needs to prioritize her health and well-being *and her relationship with you* above his parents too. Grandma getting the sad feefees cuz she couldn't undermine your reasonable rules isn't \"keep the peace\" time. To put it bluntly, he needs to nut up and take the heat from his parents ~~for once~~ WHENEVER your agreed-upon rules are undermined by his parents.", "And there are ways to deal with that. Saying \"no cookies until you eat 3 bites of this food that you hate and are actively trying to avoid eating as much as possible\" is not the way to teach your children about nutrition."]}
