FAIR ENOUGH. Just stop goin to her house for dinner jeez..... . The grandmother can have her opnion and her will in the matter.", "exactly thats what she said. I rather have you not over then you enforcing the rules..... . So she is fine with not seein them for dinner .....", "She is ABSOLUTELY undermining the parents if she is GIVING COOKIES to the child that didn't follow the rules!", "And? What is the point you\u2019re trying to make? I\u2019m saying grandma can enjoy reaping what she\u2019s sown?", "She asked if she could give her a cookie mother said no she didnt got a cookie what you on about?", "you said the grandma is overstepping boundaries and tell them how to parent their child, which she didnt do. I dunno what your point is. Stop assuming things from grandma you dont know what she thinks or want to achieve ....", "She\u2019s throwing a fit because her grandchild needs to follow the rules set by OP and her husband. She told OP and her husband that they aren\u2019t allowed to discipline THEIR child at her home. She is trying to undermine THEIR authority as parents because she \u201ccan\u2019t bear to see her granddaughter sad\u201d.", "She is telling them how to parent lol. Like literally. Which is very much overstepping. I am not reading anything into it, I\u2019m simply reading.", "well undermining would be if she would givin her the cookie regardless what the mother said, which she clearly didnt do. She never said they arent allowed to discipline the child, just she rather have them not over if they want to enforce that specific rule, which she is in her right. Stop goin over for dinner if YOU dont like her house rules. Nobody is forced", "where exactly did she tell them what they are doin is wrong and they are parenting her wrong? She just said she doesnt like it and doesnt want it in her house"]}
