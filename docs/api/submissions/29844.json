I don't even live in Toronto, it would take about two hours by train to get to downtown.  \n\nThe offers were from anywhere between a few hundred a month and 700 a month, 700 is probably the lowest you are finding a room for rent in the area.  But the issue is, I didn't need a roommate, I didn't want a roommate, I understand that it's difficult for them but I want to be more comfortable in my own home.  If it was a close personal friend that was in desperate need, they get the guest bedroom for free and they can even eat my food while they are getting back on their feet.

Blame the roommates if they keep pressuring you. I am sure the roommates wouldn\u2019t mind being the villain to make sure they don\u2019t come", "NTA and my response would have been \"That's okay Mom you're dead to me also, but I'll live to piss on your grave\"", "NTA... this is your moms fault for not accepting NO", "NTA don\u2019t let him come there", "Dude, seriously is your family that clueless, because if they are then you\u2019re better off without them. Where do they live that they think this would be ok when you\u2019re saying no and you have roommates and you don\u2019t own your own place?\n\nOh, NTA", "Ask your mother why she wants you to be homeless, because if he shows up you will be tossed out with nowhere to go except the streets. See if she cares at all. She probably still won't listen.", "NTA. Your family sounds completely delusional about conditions where you live.", "NTA, sounds like your cousin is a problem for your aunt and she is trying to make him yours. Your family has some serious boundary issues (mine does too, and when I tried to erect some healthy boundaries during a time when they massively crossed a line, I was scapegoated and am now the family pariah, so I went NC with them). Not telling you to go NC, it was just the right decision for me in my situation, but you are 100% not at fault here.\n\nYour mother and extended family are behaving in an entitled, inappropriate way, and you are doing what you need to do to protect yourself. If you\u2019re \u201cdead\u201d to them, that\u2019s their problem, not yours. They\u2019re seriously messed up if they think you\u2019re the one with the issue here. I\u2019m sorry you had to endure that. Sometimes family sucks.", "NTA. I also am struggling to afford rent with three roommates in LA. People you haven't spoken to in years come out of the woodwork when they hear you live in LA and try to crash on your couch. Never had that happening on the other city. People are just cheap and want to take advantage of you because they know it's an expensive town. They always want you to pick them up from LAX too. No just fly into Burbank it's way closer to me.", "$300 a month? In what city will $300  even get you a place to park your car so you can sleep in it,much less a room for a few nights? Much less someplace with a COL as high as LA??!!\n\nTell them he's welcome to take that ticket and that money and enjoy LA with it for as long as it will cover his housing, food, and transportation. And that he probably won't be able to do more than have a couple meals in the airport and get back on a plane.\n\nThe absolute nerve: we'll just ship him out there and OP will **have** to deal with it then. Sounds like they just want him off their hands.\n\nDon't give in OP", "NTA your family is being completely ridiculous and out of line.", "NTA. Since you're apparently already dead to the family, then so be it, he's now just a random stranger trying to trespass. Definitely call the police if he shows up at your door. The fact that he's also ignoring your calls and texts clearly shows his immaturity and inability to make his own decisions. It looks like he's relying on his mum and aunt to secure him a place to stay. It was never about 'helping' you.", "Call, email, Whatsapp, threads,X,tiktok, Instagram,text your cousin to directly tell him he needs to find a hotel or rent a room from someone. You have not even a sofa for him and it would violate the lease if you even let him spend night. Max occupancy per apartment etc. NTA", "NTA  Tell all of them that you will be evicted if your cousin shows up on your doorstep expecting to stay with you for longer then 2 days.  Your family are the ones who should be ashamed of themselves, do they not know how to listen?", "Right. The $300 for \"rent\" will be completely offset by the cost of groceries for the cousin.", "They could be renting a house so everyone has their own room. Even so, it's probably not a big house given it's LA.", "OP said it was close to $1500 mo for his room including utilities. \n\nSo not just rent.", "NTA \nYou need to prove to your family that you\u2019re NOT a doormat or people pleaser. \nDon\u2019t answer their call and don\u2019t send your address to your family. If he comes, don\u2019t let him in.", "Then return the same favor of not answering him if he dares show up. Stop allowing your family stress you out. Block them temporarily.", "Lol. How does he expect to live and interact with you for a month when he can't even answer a text or phone call", "Be a little more specific. \u201cYou can not live with me as you are not on the lease. If you show up police will be called to have you trespassed\u201d", "make sure it's very clear that your roommate will trespass him if he shows up.", "Wow that is an obscenely low bar!", "So what you are saying is that i can rent airbnb for a week and then stay there until i get evicted? Crazy.", "That statement alone should be song lyrics!", "$600 will get you a room, possibly furnished, in either a crappy neighborhood or a possibly distant suburb of Los Angeles. And you'll definitely have to hustle to find it. It's not enough to live on by a damn sight.", "Oh no, a Unicorn counts as a Horse, so it goes through Customs. It requires *so much more paperwork*.", "Yes there was a pretty horrific story about this in the la times recently. The person is still there after two or three years I believe. ETA: I\u2019m not actually sure about the seven day part (I also thought it was 30).", "especially on short notice. tbh he's better off spending it on a ticket back, like someone else said", "uhh you might find something in bakersfield i guess, but i think even a 'distant suburb' is probably too much to hope for. *maybe* ten years ago. *maybe.* but i paid $1k/mo for a studio apartment with a roach problem ten years ago, so i doubt it"]}
