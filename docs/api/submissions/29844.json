This doesn't sound like a 'visit' at all.  Sounds like they want him to move in on the cheap but are trying to make it seem differently by giving it a euphemism to make it sound better.", " IF your family honestly is going to cut you out of their lives, I think your the winner.   I sometimes have to go to LA for work and even my companies per diem barely cuts it when I stay for a week or two.  Saying it's tough to make it there is sure accurate.  I honestly don't know how people live there and have much of a quality of life.  NTA.", "What part of LA for $1500 for a room?  Your cousin will need to find a hostel or shared room arrangement and you should talk to him directly and tell him no.  He may not know the deal.", "NTA your family sucks and really tried to take advantage. You already said no and they really thought they could force it. They would be dead to me because they truly showed how they do not care about you. Block the and if the cousin shows up you already know what to do.", "NTA. wtf", "NTA, of course\n\n\"Mom, what if I sent someone to live at your house to \"help\" you with $300 but you would have to be willing to lose your house and your friends, and guaranteed this \"help\" will leave you with no home and nothing at all in the bank.  So you tell me \"no\" and try to explain why, but I said that if you don't agree you will be dead to me, that you are ungrateful and that the whole family will shun you over this.\"", "NTA\n\nI had this issue with some friends in the past couple years.  By friends I mostly mean old classmates, acquaintances, and people that know me and my situation but aren't extremely close.\n\nI bought my house a few years ago, no mortgage, from hard work and a decent amount of luck with investments.  Everyone was really happy for me, and it's not like a huge house but I do have extra rooms.  I have a guest bedroom, a small office and a game room.  It wasn't long when rent prices went up that I started getting some 'offers to help' from people, mostly from people I know living in Toronto.  I don't even live in Toronto, it would take about two hours by train to get to downtown.  \n\nThe offers were from anywhere between a few hundred a month and 700 a month, 700 is probably the lowest you are finding a room for rent in the area.  But the issue is, I didn't need a roommate, I didn't want a roommate, I understand that it's difficult for them but I want to be more comfortable in my own home.  If it was a close personal friend that was in desperate need, they get the guest bedroom for free and they can even eat my food while they are getting back on their feet.  But this was people that I might have only met a half dozen time or only knew because we worked together, went to school, and they've heard updates about me from people closer to me that they are friends with.  \n\nI'm glad I never gave in because I now live with my girlfriend here and we like the privacy.", "NTA. No means NO. Do they know your address? If Cousin shows up, don't answer the door & block all of them. If they can disown you for standing up for yourself & your roommates, you can disown them for being entitled shit-heads.", "Tell cousin to use the 600 bucks to get a cheap hotel or air bnb. Or better yet tell the family to cash in the ticket take back the 600 bucks and give this to you if they want to \u201chelp\u201d you. Either way you\u2019re NTA for setting a firm boundary.", "Exactly! It\u2019s only 30 days to determine residency and I have a former coworker who roommate just stopped paying her rent because it takes forever to evict people.  Now he can\u2019t afford both parts of the rent and he\u2019s just waiting out the process.", "He won\u2019t answer his text and calls. I already texted him he can\u2019t stay here. I get nothing back.", "Yeah, the cheapest apartment I\u2019ve ever lived in was $800 a month. If I had been sharing it with someone, then 300 a month probably would have work\u2026 But that would\u2019ve only covered part of the rent, not utilities, transportation, food. I grew up in California and unless you\u2019re going to be homeless, $300 not gonna do anything for you", "Helping them by breaking their lease and ending up without a home? That's what's gonna happen when cousin comes", "So you have done your due diligence.  You let him know he can't stay here.  So if he shows up, you can point him to close by hotels.  In LA for $600, he will have a place to stay for what...3 nights.  LOL", "Contact him on all available mediums.  Be very very clear.  Tell him that your roommate will have him arrested.  He may think it's just you he has to convince and that you won't say no.  If he knows there is another person who will call the cops on him he may decide its not worth his time.  \n\n$600 and a bus ticket are good song lyrics but a terrible plan.", "OK, so... I'm pretty sure your only option is to call the cops on him of he actually shows up. I understand why you wouldn't want to do that but it's not like you are swimming in options here.\n\nYou said he can't hold down a job? Maybe auntie is plotting to get him move out already. I'm European so I'm not sure but it sounds like 600 bucks won't cover his expenses for a month, so even if he is leaving at day 30 you are still in the negative."]}
