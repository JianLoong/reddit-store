I don't even live in Toronto, it would take about two hours by train to get to downtown.  \n\nThe offers were from anywhere between a few hundred a month and 700 a month, 700 is probably the lowest you are finding a room for rent in the area.  But the issue is, I didn't need a roommate, I didn't want a roommate, I understand that it's difficult for them but I want to be more comfortable in my own home.  If it was a close personal friend that was in desperate need, they get the guest bedroom for free and they can even eat my food while they are getting back on their feet.  But this was people that I might have only met a half dozen time or only knew because we worked together, went to school, and they've heard updates about me from people closer to me that they are friends with.  \n\nI'm glad I never gave in because I now live with my girlfriend here and we like the privacy.", "NTA.
