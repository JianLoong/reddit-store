We had been dating for five years, and while we had discussed marriage before, there were no immediate plans for a wedding.\n\nExcited about the event, I dressed up in my best attire and arrived at the designated venue. As I entered the grand hall, I was completely taken aback to see all of our family, friends, and acquaintances gathered, eagerly waiting. It turns out, Mark had orchestrated an elaborate surprise wedding for us without my knowledge.\n\nEveryone erupted into applause as I stood there, shocked and overwhelmed. I just felt a mix of emotions. While I love Mark and had dreamed of our future together, the idea of getting married without any prior discussion or consent felt like a breach of trust.\n\nSo, I pulled Mark aside and tried to express my concerns and reservations about the surprise wedding. I explained that I wanted a say in the planning process, to be part of the decision-making, and to have the chance to prepare mentally and emotionally for such a significant milestone in our lives.\n\nHowever, Mark dismissed my concerns, saying that he thought it would be a romantic gesture and that I would be thrilled.In that moment, I faced a difficult choice go along with the surprise wedding, putting on a smile despite feeling unsettled, or stand up for my autonomy and voice my true feelings. I ultimately made the decision not to proceed with the surprise wedding, much to the disappointment and confusion of our guests.\n\nNow, I find myself at odds with Mark, our families, and even some of our friends who believe I overreacted and spoiled a beautiful moment. However, I firmly believe that a marriage should be a joint decision, with open communication and shared expectations.\n\nEveryone's excuse for this is I have always talked about marrying Mark. And again the problem isn't marrying him, the problem is not having any say in my wedding. Mark thought I'd appreciate it, because I always spoke about how stressful planning a wedding must be. Yes, I think its stressful, it is but I'd still like planning one!\n\nAfter this whole ordeal everyone asked if Mark and I were ending things, in which I replied no. I emphasized towards them and Mark I still wanted to marry him, and most feel like this is making me more of an asshole since I just wasted a perfectly fine wedding.\n\nSo AITA for refusing to attend my own surprise wedding, even though it was intended as a romantic gesture?\n\nEdit: I previously omitted this from my post because of the subreddit's word count guidelines. I love surprises it's a thing everyone has known me to love. Mark knowing that, the fact I wanted to marry him, and said wedding planning was stressful thought a surprise wedding would be perfect. A surprise engagement is bland, because it will always be a surprise but not a wedding lol. He threw this \"wedding\" for the surprise, but explained how in a couple days we could do a courthouse wedding to make it legal, this was his only way to surprise me. I love spontaneity, but legal marriage or not, I wanted a say in my wedding. To choose the perfect date, to choose my bridesmaids, to pick out my cake. Again due to these thoughts everyone thinks I'm the asshole, because I could have went along with the party, and do a redo legal wedding.

However, you have a right to feel as you did and everyone should respect that. I would imagine that the 'surprise' wedding didn't cost nearly as much as a full decked out wedding would and hopefully was no more than an expensive night out with the added cost of a justice of the peace or minister.\n\nI would try to get your bf to understand that how you go into this commitment is how you should both expect the relationship to work as a whole. I.e., there are no major surprises when it comes to the big things in life. Obviously, you're a hands-on person and want to be involved in any discussions and decisions. If he can understand that and can get over the hurt of feeling rejected because you didn't care for his surprise, go ahead and plan your wedding now together.\n\nI'm assuming a lot here though. You paint your bf in a good overall light. So I'm hoping he isn't controlling or possessive. It was a big move he made and it took a lot of balls and assumptions on his part to do so. Yet your family and friends all went along with it, so they must like him since not one of them warned you.\n\nI wish you the best of luck mending fences if he truly is a good guy.

It's not just him that came up with 5.\n\nHow did the idea even come to be? Was he joking with their friends about how much she loves surprises and that he should do a surprise wedding and they were like \"omg you should TOTALLY do that!!\" No one at any point was like, I'm not sure we've thought this through? And they are even mad at her afterwards that she didn't like it? It doesn't really add up", "Doesn't even sound like he proposed first. I wonder what the heck happened there. A surprise proposal is one thing, but a sudden \"Surprise! It's our wedding!\" is a whole other charlie-foxtrot.", "It can happen, and the excitement of keeping a large secret is very adrenaline building.   I have experience with a surprise wedding.  And from that experience, I would now break the secret, or push back on the planning person to reconsider (and be the asshole who told the other).\n\nHaving one party sell their vision, and bring people on board one group at a time; and then with more people agreeing and participating made for a sort of peer-pressure that basically silenced the few who were staunchly against it to keep quiet, because they don't want to be the one to ruin someone's wedding.", "Seriously, there\u2019s no way my mom would\u2019ve signed on to attend this without giving me some sort of head\u2019s up. They must really, really like that guy and not be too concerned about their daughter\u2019s feelings or autonomy", "Yeah, it's like saying \"I definitely want to have kids one day but I do worry about how stressful and tiring raising a baby might be,\" and then having your BF \"surprise\" you with some 8-year-old kid he bought off the internet.", "No Mark is definitely the AH here, for his reaction to her reaction. Ok he took a risk based on some misunderstanding about what she\u2019d want, but when she pulled him aside and told him she wasn\u2019t comfortable with it, his reaction to that and to her leaning is what makes him the asshole. He should\u2019ve just apologized and said he made the wrong call but they cooks still have a fun night with everyone and not worry about it being their wedding. And it sounds like he\u2019s STILL guilting her over it and his friends and family. Def the AH here", "Imagine being the kind of person who actually thinks that manipulating someone into MARRIAGE with a SURPRISE WEDDING isn't a dumping offense. Your normal meter needs a serious recalibration.", "Okay so first of, I believe the Disney villain part is parody and satire. Second, someone who coerce you to do something - EVEN IF YOU DO WANT IT - without asking you first, robbing you of your abilities to make a decision, is abusive. Stripping somebody of their power to choose is bad, and I would definitely leave. What does that says ab their relationship ? Does that mean that HIS wishes, HIS plans, go before hers, without even asking her ? That's bad. And I mean, like BAD.", "People are rightly seeing a pretty huge red flag first in his total disregard for what she might want in a wedding, and again in the way he dismissed her when she expressed her objection to the wedding.  Should she break up immediately?  Perhaps not, but she sure does need to take a SERIOUS second look at this man and this relationship", "I agree, it's fake. Or something completely different happened and OP added some flourish :)", "Exactly so.  For most people, the document that designates your state-sanctioned sexy-time as contractually binding is just legal paperwork: the real marriage comes from the vows you make to each other in front of friends, family, the church, God or whomever.  And you don\u2019t make that vow if you have reservations or feel pressured to make them before you\u2019re ready to do so.\n\nIt would be like saying, \u201cTechnically you didn\u2019t sign an IOU so do you *really* have to pay him back?\u201d  Yeah Phyllis, I swore I would so I really have to.", "I am aghast", "I think there is way more to this story and would love Marks view. As OP said in her edit, she LOVES surprises but hates surprise engagements. She has made it clear that her and Mark will get married but also has made it clear how stressful and unappealing planning a wedding is. While I would think under normal circumstances, planning a surprise wedding is insane, the entire family and friend group thought it was wonderful and nobody objected. This gives me the confidence that this was something that everyone thought OP would love. \n\nI personally think a surprise wedding in any form is insane and should never happen. I also think Mark should run away as fast as he can. OP seems like someone that will never be satisfied", "What\u2019s really missing from this story is how all of OP\u2019s friends and family somehow went along with this idiotic plan\u2026? Nobody expressed concern or doubt over this plan? Did OP\u2019s husband ignore those people? If OP\u2019s husband ignored any concerns, why didn\u2019t any friends or family see red flags and tell OP??", "What about seeing your fianc\u00e9 get tackled by dodgers security and spend some time in jail?", "My dad surprised my mom by getting the house painted while she was on a girls trip. My mom had been agonizing over paint colors because she wanted a very specific shade of green, and my dad just randomly picked one and spent thousands having the whole house painted that color. Then he was surprised when she came home and started bawling because she hated the color. \n\nLike 20 years later (and they've since repainted the house) and she still brings it up when she's mad at him lol.", ">  I explained that I wanted a say in the planning process, to be part of the decision-making, and to have the chance to prepare mentally and emotionally for such a significant milestone in our lives.\n\nThis sounded strange to me, though: if I were her my first thought (and argument) wouldn't be \"I didn't get to plan this!\" but \"wtf you just ran me over with this, are you out of your mind?\" And everyone else was OK with this?", "This is so true. I knew there was a point I was missing, about why this was unacceptable, this is it.\n\nMy ex-fianc\u00e9 could discuss marriage in the abstract. Even wanting to be married, in the abstract. But when we were briefly engaged he acted like a coyote with its leg in a trap, he was that desperate to escape. It's absolutely one thing to say you want to marry someone and something else to have them call your bluff with no warning!", "That is so right, if Mark just gave her the choice, OP would not have felt the need to leave, but instead he was pressuring her to go through with it. What an AH!", "Yeah just turn into a engagement party or whatever, tell everyone to come back next year for the wedding", "It seems the opposite of thoughtless. It seems like it's based on her own preferences and things that she's said. It seems like the sort of thing you'd have to know her well, or at least how she apparently presents herself, to even come up with. All of her friends and family thought she'd like it too.

My boyfriend is OP. Loves surprises, loves me, wants to marry me. *However*, he\u2019s also very specific about his dream wedding. For years, he\u2019s been excitedly looking forward to planning that special day. Regardless of his personality type/his desire to marry me, I would never interpret that to mean it would be a good idea to completely take that experience away from him.

The reason I still believe it's possible is because it's happened before.", "Yeah Mark is a ducking crazy person.  Your families too.", "Actually, I'm a wedding officiant and I've had two people approach me over the years wanting me to officiate their surprise wedding.  And when I try to clarify that they mean a surprise for their guests, that they are both on board with the wedding and are just telling everyone is an engagement party during which we'll surprise everyone by marrying them then and there (which I've done twice and loved), the inquiring person said, no, it was going to be a surprise for their soon-to-be spouse.  I noped out of that very quickly, as that is super odd and not something I'd be okay with.  So, it wouldn't surprise me at all that this is real.", "Oh, it could be.    A high-school friend of mine was put in the same situation a few years ago.  \n\nA church wedding and reception, about 150 guests.  Everyone knew except her.  \n\nIt seemed like a good idea.  Boyfriend tested the idea out with a small group, and got enough buy in.  Then went through with the start of planning and logistics.   Everyone was excited to keep the secret, and plan and set up the event, and venue, and the practice run.  It wasn't until the actual day when you saw her expression of ... shock?, did anyone begin to second guess whether it was right.    \n\nIt was a tense ceremony, that eventually mellowed out as the event progressed.\n\nI don't know what happened between the two in the week afterwards.  I can't imagine it was easy for either of them.   They had a second wedding the following year, with her input.    Now, with a few years of time buffering the emotions, she can laugh about it, and enjoy the gesture.    If given the change, I don't think anyone involved would do it all over again.", "That was the sentence which tipped me from \"this is probably fake, right?\" to \"definitely made up\". Surprised how many are buying this", "wtf that's beyond fucked if true. Like I find OP's story a bit too sitcom like to be real, but your thing sounds more believable because the idea of someone being that sick in the head is just far too real.", "So sad when you put it that way, she missed out on getting proposed to, picking out a dress, asking her friends to be bridesmaids, picking when and then anticipating all of it.", "I\u2019m just having a really hard time understanding how people are even calling this romantic.
