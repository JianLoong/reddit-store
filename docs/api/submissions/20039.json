We had been dating for five years, and while we had discussed marriage before, there were no immediate plans for a wedding.\n\nExcited about the event, I dressed up in my best attire and arrived at the designated venue. As I entered the grand hall, I was completely taken aback to see all of our family, friends, and acquaintances gathered, eagerly waiting. It turns out, Mark had orchestrated an elaborate surprise wedding for us without my knowledge.\n\nEveryone erupted into applause as I stood there, shocked and overwhelmed. I just felt a mix of emotions. While I love Mark and had dreamed of our future together, the idea of getting married without any prior discussion or consent felt like a breach of trust.\n\nSo, I pulled Mark aside and tried to express my concerns and reservations about the surprise wedding. I explained that I wanted a say in the planning process, to be part of the decision-making, and to have the chance to prepare mentally and emotionally for such a significant milestone in our lives.\n\nHowever, Mark dismissed my concerns, saying that he thought it would be a romantic gesture and that I would be thrilled.In that moment, I faced a difficult choice go along with the surprise wedding, putting on a smile despite feeling unsettled, or stand up for my autonomy and voice my true feelings. I ultimately made the decision not to proceed with the surprise wedding, much to the disappointment and confusion of our guests.\n\nNow, I find myself at odds with Mark, our families, and even some of our friends who believe I overreacted and spoiled a beautiful moment. However, I firmly believe that a marriage should be a joint decision, with open communication and shared expectations.\n\nEveryone's excuse for this is I have always talked about marrying Mark. And again the problem isn't marrying him, the problem is not having any say in my wedding. Mark thought I'd appreciate it, because I always spoke about how stressful planning a wedding must be. Yes, I think its stressful, it is but I'd still like planning one!\n\nAfter this whole ordeal everyone asked if Mark and I were ending things, in which I replied no. I emphasized towards them and Mark I still wanted to marry him, and most feel like this is making me more of an asshole since I just wasted a perfectly fine wedding.\n\nSo AITA for refusing to attend my own surprise wedding, even though it was intended as a romantic gesture?\n\nEdit: I previously omitted this from my post because of the subreddit's word count guidelines. I love surprises it's a thing everyone has known me to love. Mark knowing that, the fact I wanted to marry him, and said wedding planning was stressful thought a surprise wedding would be perfect. A surprise engagement is bland, because it will always be a surprise but not a wedding lol. He threw this \"wedding\" for the surprise, but explained how in a couple days we could do a courthouse wedding to make it legal, this was his only way to surprise me. I love spontaneity, but legal marriage or not, I wanted a say in my wedding. To choose the perfect date, to choose my bridesmaids, to pick out my cake. Again due to these thoughts everyone thinks I'm the asshole, because I could have went along with the party, and do a redo legal wedding.

However, you have a right to feel as you did and everyone should respect that. I would imagine that the 'surprise' wedding didn't cost nearly as much as a full decked out wedding would and hopefully was no more than an expensive night out with the added cost of a justice of the peace or minister.\n\nI would try to get your bf to understand that how you go into this commitment is how you should both expect the relationship to work as a whole. I.e., there are no major surprises when it comes to the big things in life. Obviously, you're a hands-on person and want to be involved in any discussions and decisions. If he can understand that and can get over the hurt of feeling rejected because you didn't care for his surprise, go ahead and plan your wedding now together.\n\nI'm assuming a lot here though. You paint your bf in a good overall light. So I'm hoping he isn't controlling or possessive. It was a big move he made and it took a lot of balls and assumptions on his part to do so. Yet your family and friends all went along with it, so they must like him since not one of them warned you.\n\nI wish you the best of luck mending fences if he truly is a good guy.

So, no, you can\u2019t walk away and leave him with \u201chis\u201d debt if you\u2019re married.", "It\u2019s as low as [one year](https://www.findlaw.com/family/marriage/common-law-marriages-faq-s-what-states-recognize-common-law.html) in several states.", "If this is the US, wedding venue certification is not a thing, there is no special legal status for a venue. You can get married in your bathroom if you want, or diving from a plane or in the ocean, in a park or a parking lot, or anywhere you fancy, and it will be just as legal as the courthouse if you have your marriage license and an officiant (in at least one state you don't even need one of those) and usually 2 witnesses to sign the license. \n\nBut you do both need to show up in person for the license at a local city/town hall, and that's why this can't be a legal wedding. Mark can't get a license for them both, he'd need OP there with ID, and that obviously would have blown the (beyond shitty and horrific) surprise.", "Seriously, the concept of a \"surprise wedding\" means it's supposed to be a surprise for the *guests*, not the BRIDE!!!!", "Where are op\u2019s parents! Did they honestly think this was a good idea? Because I  am a parent no way in Hell I agree to this. I would have told the groom want to be you tell her or I tell her that\u2019s your two options but you don\u2019t get to blind side her.", "I'm amazed they agreed to it. What tale did he tell them so they would do it? Or are they all cotton-headed ninnymuggins?", "That was my thought!! How did everyone think this was \"romantic\"? I think people like being \"in\" on the surprise, so they didn't say anything?", "This is also why I'm a little suspicious that this story is actually true. A group that large, SOMEONE is gonna spill the beans beforehand.", "Yeah, came here to say but only is the boyfriend TA but so is every single guest and family member who knew about this and decided to go along with it. NTA. \n\nIf you don't want to spoil the surprise you can always present a hypothetical and find a person's position.", "No wonder 6 eggs are too expensive for that poor mother. Gaston is jacking up the prices, paying for 5 dozen eggs, DAILY.", "*swoons*", "[removed]", "Yesss \ud83e\udd23", "I'm just imagining how broken this entire family has to be, to think any of this is okay.", "And trying to excuse it with, \"Well, it's not a REAL wedding.\" Great, then not getting pretend-married shouldn't be a problem for anyone. But mysteriously everyone is butthurt except OP. What is wrong with these people?!", "It's just like. A surprise engagement party was right there. Right there!", "IF THAT is how he treats her when he is trusting his instincts, SHE should RUN.", "Only thoughtless? Crass and absolutely atrocious truly. Especially considering the OP wanted to get married and have a big wedding. He left her out completely. She didn't get to choose her bridal party, or dress, or even who was going to be there. He took zero consideration into what she wanted for what she feels is a huge once in a lifetime experience for her. \n\nHe created a nightmare.", "Yeah, I can\u2019t believe that none of her friends or family suggested that this might not be a good idea! I\u2019d hate to have a wedding sprung on me like that, no matter how much I wanted to marry the person, I want to be involved in planning my own wedding, choosing a dress etc.", "Is this your first time in AITA?", "I wish people would realize that the vast majority of AHs think they are doing a nice thing.  They have good intentions. But you can be an AH with good intentions if your intentions run roughshod over what someone else wants, to force them to do what *you* want when *you* want it.  \n\nLots of people, including myself, like surprises.  But that means we like having a gift sprung on us unexpectedly or a surprise birthday party.  Not something as life-changing as getting married!  And a lot of people have a dream for how they want their wedding to somewhat adhere to, down to the music that gets played as they walk down the aisle.  OP's bf stole this from the OP.  I have no interest in ever getting married and even I can see how fucked up this is.\n\nI like diving off of high diving boards, but the idea of being pushed off of one when I'm least expecting it, with all my friends and family watching, is an absolute nightmare.  To me, this is what happened to the OP.", "They went though with a lot of expensive things (booking the venue, probably flowers, food)", "People complain about having to plan a wedding but still enjoy it", "I don't know. I see where you're coming from but most stories in life feel different if you're there for them.\n\nI'd be able to sympathize with the \"honest mistake\"-angle if he hadn't been a dick afterwards. There's a reason the saying \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\" exists, after all.", "Which is precisely why a surprise wedding is far more egregious. Because being wed had a lot of far-reaching legal consequences.\n\nSo thank you for inadvertently proving the opposite of the point you were trying to make \ud83d\ude04", "Most states have long done away with it, but yeah, they used it to screen for diseases like rubella and TB as well as some STIs like syphilis and gonorrhea. As of 2019, when Montana repealed the last one, no state requires it in the US anymore.", "I agree!", "*he dismissed my concerns* \n\nHuge red flag.

IMO, he created and executed a romantic fantasy for himself, so that he could be the big hero around the family members.
