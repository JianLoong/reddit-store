We had been dating for five years, and while we had discussed marriage before, there were no immediate plans for a wedding.\n\nExcited about the event, I dressed up in my best attire and arrived at the designated venue. As I entered the grand hall, I was completely taken aback to see all of our family, friends, and acquaintances gathered, eagerly waiting. It turns out, Mark had orchestrated an elaborate surprise wedding for us without my knowledge.\n\nEveryone erupted into applause as I stood there, shocked and overwhelmed. I just felt a mix of emotions. While I love Mark and had dreamed of our future together, the idea of getting married without any prior discussion or consent felt like a breach of trust.\n\nSo, I pulled Mark aside and tried to express my concerns and reservations about the surprise wedding. I explained that I wanted a say in the planning process, to be part of the decision-making, and to have the chance to prepare mentally and emotionally for such a significant milestone in our lives.\n\nHowever, Mark dismissed my concerns, saying that he thought it would be a romantic gesture and that I would be thrilled.In that moment, I faced a difficult choice go along with the surprise wedding, putting on a smile despite feeling unsettled, or stand up for my autonomy and voice my true feelings. I ultimately made the decision not to proceed with the surprise wedding, much to the disappointment and confusion of our guests.\n\nNow, I find myself at odds with Mark, our families, and even some of our friends who believe I overreacted and spoiled a beautiful moment. However, I firmly believe that a marriage should be a joint decision, with open communication and shared expectations.\n\nEveryone's excuse for this is I have always talked about marrying Mark. And again the problem isn't marrying him, the problem is not having any say in my wedding. Mark thought I'd appreciate it, because I always spoke about how stressful planning a wedding must be. Yes, I think its stressful, it is but I'd still like planning one!\n\nAfter this whole ordeal everyone asked if Mark and I were ending things, in which I replied no. I emphasized towards them and Mark I still wanted to marry him, and most feel like this is making me more of an asshole since I just wasted a perfectly fine wedding.\n\nSo AITA for refusing to attend my own surprise wedding, even though it was intended as a romantic gesture?\n\nEdit: I previously omitted this from my post because of the subreddit's word count guidelines. I love surprises it's a thing everyone has known me to love. Mark knowing that, the fact I wanted to marry him, and said wedding planning was stressful thought a surprise wedding would be perfect. A surprise engagement is bland, because it will always be a surprise but not a wedding lol. He threw this \"wedding\" for the surprise, but explained how in a couple days we could do a courthouse wedding to make it legal, this was his only way to surprise me. I love spontaneity, but legal marriage or not, I wanted a say in my wedding. To choose the perfect date, to choose my bridesmaids, to pick out my cake. Again due to these thoughts everyone thinks I'm the asshole, because I could have went along with the party, and do a redo legal wedding.

Obviously that would open you to the risk of making a similar error, but at least you've got a template. And he kinda can't be all that upset if you did.

However, you have a right to feel as you did and everyone should respect that. I would imagine that the 'surprise' wedding didn't cost nearly as much as a full decked out wedding would and hopefully was no more than an expensive night out with the added cost of a justice of the peace or minister.\n\nI would try to get your bf to understand that how you go into this commitment is how you should both expect the relationship to work as a whole. I.e., there are no major surprises when it comes to the big things in life. Obviously, you're a hands-on person and want to be involved in any discussions and decisions. If he can understand that and can get over the hurt of feeling rejected because you didn't care for his surprise, go ahead and plan your wedding now together.\n\nI'm assuming a lot here though. You paint your bf in a good overall light. So I'm hoping he isn't controlling or possessive. It was a big move he made and it took a lot of balls and assumptions on his part to do so. Yet your family and friends all went along with it, so they must like him since not one of them warned you.\n\nI wish you the best of luck mending fences if he truly is a good guy.

She complained about the idea of having to plan a wedding, but then got upset she didn't get to plan the wedding?", "[deleted]", "Sure", "Compromise is the healthy give and take that happens in all relationships. Where decisions are made based on mutual input. Control is the unhealthy imbalance of power where decisions are made without input, consent, or consideration of the other person.", "It's not one point.... its a massive milestone to be remembered and cherished forever. He's not said he wants total control, but he's sure acting like it. I genuinely think the best thing is for these 2 to find someone better suited to themselves", "That's a strawman argument, I do not talk to people that use strawman arguments.", "They were just agreeing with you and confirming what you said.", "Are you saying you would have rejected your husband had he done a surprise wedding like this?", "You\u2019re moving the goal posts. You said a blood test is required and I\u2019m telling you one isn\u2019t. Nowhere did he try to marry her without her consent. He proposed and she rejected him.", "Like I figured.", "I said \u201cgiving up control,\u201d not \u201cbeing under control.\u201d\n\nCompromise is giving up control, and autonomy. Not completely, of course. But you are giving up some of it. You don\u2019t get to make decisions based solely on yourself and your own desires.", "It\u2019s still just a point in time. The wedding does not defined the marriage.\n\nShe rejected him for the sake of having her ideal wedding. I think that\u2019s a shitty reason.", "You don\u2019t know what a strawman argument is if you think I just made one. But feel free not to talk to me if you don\u2019t know how to engage in logical discourse.", "I know now but i try to only edit my comments if there's something super wrong with it and i only delete them if i realize i broke a rule. I hate getting half way through a thread and a comment was edited so much it messes up the thread for future readers.", "I absolutely would have rejected a surprise wedding, but lucky for me, he respected my autonomy enough that he never would have pulled a stunt like this. Which is why I did marry him after he properly asked me to without pressuring me to give up everything I wanted from an engagement and wedding in front of all my family and friends.", "[deleted]", "The point of a compromise is that you both have control. By making decisions mutually, or compromising, you are both controlling the decision. And honestly, nobody has total control. Like ever. Even if you\u2019re single. Because you compromise with friends, family, coworkers, even yourself. (Wanna watch that show? Ugh. I gotta clean the house. Okay. I\u2019ll do a bathroom and then watch an episode\u2026) So in real life no one gets to make 100% of decisions based solely on themselves your their desires. \n\nAlso, this is an interesting debate, but when it comes to major life decisions like engagements, weddings, having kids, both parties better be involved. Just because she said wedding planning was stressful does not mean she doesn\u2019t want to be involved. Unless she explicitly said she wanted nothing (zero, zilch, nada, nothing) to do with the planning, saying it would be stressful does not imply she wanted no input.", "I'm going to grab your bait:\n\nWhere did I admit you give up controll when you marry?", "If you\u2019re single, you have about as much control as a person can have in one\u2019s life.", "\u201cYes, you have more control single\u2026\u201d", "That's what I  meant by not being single when you marry:\n\nThe whole relationship is about sharing your life and, therefore, SHARING control. \n\nThe actual marriage is an important step for me, and that doesn't change the way your relationship works:\n\n\"Yes, the way we share our lives is good for me. Let's do this until we die,\" \n\nif the amount of control over life changes at the day of marriage, you married the wrong one.\n\nSo no, I don't think you lose control when you marry. You already shared control over a joint life as soon as you got in a relationship.", "I can agree with that."]}
