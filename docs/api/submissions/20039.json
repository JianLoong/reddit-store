We had been dating for five years, and while we had discussed marriage before, there were no immediate plans for a wedding.\n\nExcited about the event, I dressed up in my best attire and arrived at the designated venue. As I entered the grand hall, I was completely taken aback to see all of our family, friends, and acquaintances gathered, eagerly waiting. It turns out, Mark had orchestrated an elaborate surprise wedding for us without my knowledge.\n\nEveryone erupted into applause as I stood there, shocked and overwhelmed. I just felt a mix of emotions. While I love Mark and had dreamed of our future together, the idea of getting married without any prior discussion or consent felt like a breach of trust.\n\nSo, I pulled Mark aside and tried to express my concerns and reservations about the surprise wedding. I explained that I wanted a say in the planning process, to be part of the decision-making, and to have the chance to prepare mentally and emotionally for such a significant milestone in our lives.\n\nHowever, Mark dismissed my concerns, saying that he thought it would be a romantic gesture and that I would be thrilled.In that moment, I faced a difficult choice go along with the surprise wedding, putting on a smile despite feeling unsettled, or stand up for my autonomy and voice my true feelings. I ultimately made the decision not to proceed with the surprise wedding, much to the disappointment and confusion of our guests.\n\nNow, I find myself at odds with Mark, our families, and even some of our friends who believe I overreacted and spoiled a beautiful moment. However, I firmly believe that a marriage should be a joint decision, with open communication and shared expectations.\n\nEveryone's excuse for this is I have always talked about marrying Mark. And again the problem isn't marrying him, the problem is not having any say in my wedding. Mark thought I'd appreciate it, because I always spoke about how stressful planning a wedding must be. Yes, I think its stressful, it is but I'd still like planning one!\n\nAfter this whole ordeal everyone asked if Mark and I were ending things, in which I replied no. I emphasized towards them and Mark I still wanted to marry him, and most feel like this is making me more of an asshole since I just wasted a perfectly fine wedding.\n\nSo AITA for refusing to attend my own surprise wedding, even though it was intended as a romantic gesture?\n\nEdit: I previously omitted this from my post because of the subreddit's word count guidelines. I love surprises it's a thing everyone has known me to love. Mark knowing that, the fact I wanted to marry him, and said wedding planning was stressful thought a surprise wedding would be perfect. A surprise engagement is bland, because it will always be a surprise but not a wedding lol. He threw this \"wedding\" for the surprise, but explained how in a couple days we could do a courthouse wedding to make it legal, this was his only way to surprise me. I love spontaneity, but legal marriage or not, I wanted a say in my wedding. To choose the perfect date, to choose my bridesmaids, to pick out my cake. Again due to these thoughts everyone thinks I'm the asshole, because I could have went along with the party, and do a redo legal wedding.

However, you have a right to feel as you did and everyone should respect that. I would imagine that the 'surprise' wedding didn't cost nearly as much as a full decked out wedding would and hopefully was no more than an expensive night out with the added cost of a justice of the peace or minister.\n\nI would try to get your bf to understand that how you go into this commitment is how you should both expect the relationship to work as a whole. I.e., there are no major surprises when it comes to the big things in life. Obviously, you're a hands-on person and want to be involved in any discussions and decisions. If he can understand that and can get over the hurt of feeling rejected because you didn't care for his surprise, go ahead and plan your wedding now together.\n\nI'm assuming a lot here though. You paint your bf in a good overall light. So I'm hoping he isn't controlling or possessive. It was a big move he made and it took a lot of balls and assumptions on his part to do so. Yet your family and friends all went along with it, so they must like him since not one of them warned you.\n\nI wish you the best of luck mending fences if he truly is a good guy.

Generally directed at women ofc.", "And now I'm a man I eat five dozen eggs and I'm roughly the size of a baaaaaaarge!", "You are right even if you give up on his quick marriage. He didn't include you when you had a say in such an important event.", "Did you go through with it?", "So someone do read the edit. With all the comments i wasnt sure.\n\nI would have hated to be \"Mark\" in this relationship. My vote goes to ESH.", "She already said she wanted to marry him.", "You have to get a blood test to get married? (I am British, don't think that is a thing here)", "[deleted]", "Usually it is worded as mutual partnership for your mutual benefit.  Control tends to be a self centered way of looking at marriage which usually is not a successful approach to marriage.  Kind of like saying Christmas is about getting gifts.", "Control is the word that but you in the ass here man.  Compromise for your mutual growth you could have gotten away with.  But control makes it seems like you are appeasing your spouse.  It is an all about me statement.", "The example in the post isn't compromise; it's one partner making a unilateral decision (surprise! we're getting married right NOW) about a major part of their lives together.", "It is usually considered a starting point that two people willingly enter into.  So by taking away the willingly by peer pressure is insane.  You know that even in arranged marriage the people getting married still agree to it.", "Because she wasn't thrilled to show up for a regular party to be TOLD she was getting married on the spot? If that's what you're looking for in a \"partner\", good luck with your search but don't hold your breath. You're giving off creepy control freak vibes.", "She wasn't overjoyed by this huge shocker of a \"surprise wedding\" almost no woman would want, and politely as she could, backed out, so you think she's not marriage material? \n\nI'm pretty sure you just showed what kind of person **you** are. It sounds like you think women should be grateful for even the tiniest or most thoughtless crumbs of effort from men concerning marriage, that women should be ready to \"give up control\" as you put it, lest they not be \"marriage material\" anymore and no man will want them.", ">I would have hated to be \"Mark\" in this relationship. My vote goes to ESH.\n\nAnd yet, I have a feeling you are definitely a Mark in your relationships. my vote is you, specifically, are the asshole for your idiot comments.", "If I say I want to have sex with you, it doesn't mean you can break into my house in the middle of the night and force yourself on me", "I don't think you understood my comment. That's simply the reality of a lot of Christian women. And honestly, I don't get what your comment is even supposed to be saying. Like what part of my comment am I supposed to be looking into the mirror for? I grew up Catholic. I'm familiar with a few women who are Christian. That crap is something I heard being told to women. So really, explain what you're being aggressive about.", "The commenter isn\u2019t saying they personally believe that, just that it\u2019s an unfortunately common belief to hold.", "It's very telling (and not about me) that you characterize as aggressive a reply that you don't like and pretend to not understand.", "Could have fooled me, because the commenter led that with some drivel about OP being the bad guy because she wasn't down with saying \"I do\" on command.", "Now you're projecting to support your bs position. No way you would do what you're attacking OP for not doing, if you found yourself in that situation.", "She rejected him for the sake of having *any say at all* in *their* wedding.", "I hope tomorrow someone will just stand you on an altar and marry you off to someone. Like - marriage is about losing control, so why should you have a say when, where and with who you're getting married? And don't you dare reject that marriage - surprise isn't a good reason for that", "Cute, you talking about logic here.", "Yeah, I think if you love someone, the details of the wedding shouldn\u2019t be a dealbreaker.", "No, it's very telling about you. You know you're wrong. \"Pretend not to understand,\" you say, but your comment literally missed my point.\n\n\"Christians believe you have to relinquish control to your spouse. But of course that expectation is only on women.\" To make it even simpler: christians have a sexist double standard where women have to be under their husbands control but they phrase it as though both are equal. \n\nDo you finally get it? Do you see where you're wrong? Do you see how you've been blinded by feeling \"that's sexist!\" and can't even comprehend what the sentence said?\n\nEdit: who said I said they were sheep? Just admit you misunderstood my comment. If I say Christians believe in Jesus, am I saying every Christian follows his teachings? Because we all know they don't. Some do. Some don't. And some twist it around to pretend like they are. Plus blocking me won't make you correct.", "Are you sure that\u2019s the same person? I don\u2019t see anything like that in this guy\u2019s comment history.", "The details of the wedding would not be the dealbreaker part of pulling this stunt. It's the disrespect of putting someone you supposedly love in the high pressure situation of a surprise wedding when you haven't even bothered to propose to them yet. It's the disrespect of not bothering to find out what someone you supposedly love actually wants out of a once in a lifetime event. Love is very important, obviously, but you are not recognizing that a lot more has to go into a successful marriage, like communication, teamwork, respect, compatibility. Surprising someone with a WEDDING when you haven't even bothered to PROPOSE demonstrates none of those things.", "Have you ever considered that Christian women are not what you think they are, which is apparently sheep in your estimation?", "I think you discovered the best state for yourself.", "Okay. Sure. The more isolated you are from the world, the more control you can claim.", "The control obsession with marriage is taking this to a little bit rapey, 50 shades of grey master slave place that is weird man.  Your obsession with control and marriage is weird.  I hate to be that guy but you got me picturing whips and chains every time you say control.  Starting to feel like a buffalo bill thing going on here man.", "There is no disrespect, unless you have an ego about it.  They had already discussed marriage; and she still wants to marry him (but he would be stupid to do it after how she treated him).  She said no out of spite.", "It's an ego problem to be unhappy when you are TOLD you will be getting married instead of being ASKED if you want to?"]}
