I have spent my whole post-school life fending off people who think that because it\u2019s \u2018posh\u2019 or \u2018rich people stuff\u2019 or \u2018in the countryside\u2019 or \u2018privileged\u2019 or etc etc boarding school must be wonderful and marvellous and just like in the old children\u2019s adventure novels they read or whatever. And I think sometimes at some schools it is like that - I have a friend who went to a pretty small and uneventful one. But a lot of these places are just hell on Earth - enclosed, tyrannical prison systems run by the sort of people who enjoy the idea of having total control over vulnerable children with no state oversight or accountability. And every child at my school knew that we were there because we weren\u2019t wanted at home. Every single one. I\u2019m not going to argue whether that\u2019s \u2018better\u2019 or \u2018worse\u2019 than being a latchkey kid but it fucking sucks, and then you can\u2019t even go home, because you\u2019re not welcome there. /getting off my soapbox now, this post is not exactly about this issue, but I live for the day I see less romanticisation of these cruel and unusual relics of British Imperialism, which is really all they are when you get down to it.", "In that case, you still take care of your kid. I didn\u2019t want to have a kid at 17, but that\u2019s what happened. I\u2019ve done every single thing I can for him and I would NEVER consider boarding school. \u201cNot wanting kids\u201d isn\u2019t a good enough reason to treat them like shit and throw them away.", "I\u2019m not sure, but it may be that she did all the parenting to this point. Even if the dad worked crazy hours trying to get the business going, the boy might see his dad since they used to be living in the house. His dad has left the marriage when the son is on the cusp of becoming a young man.

OP is the one who wrote the post and is present for people to yell at, B. the mom purposely giving up custody for her career is in a comment and not the original post (and you can in fact see a ton of people also being pissed at her in response to that comment from OP), and C. she at least has the slight excuse of having \"done her time\" as primary caregiver who previously majorly sacrificed her career for it compared to OP instantly tossing his son to boarding school. (Not to say that she isn't also a shitty parent, because she is, she just has an excuse people may be sympathetic to.)", "There's a comment where OP claims his wife didn't want any custody, so that she could focus on her career, after it taking a backseat for the previous 7 years.", "Got a source for that?", "If it is \"rare\", it's because men generally don't ask for it.", "\\> he stays at home \\*most\\* weekends and i call him every other night\n\nContradiction there.

Also his mom's a deadbeat who abandon him so his dad is taking care of him by himself. It sounds like this is for the best. Also maybe his old school sucked. Maybe the place was CRAZY underfunded and he couldn't thrive there. Maybe the school has a really good program he likes. There's literally a hundred reasons he might like the boarding school better.", "Wow bro! What did SK ever do to you?", "Yeah. I really hope that one was fake because it was fucked up", "It\u2019s harder to be a single working parent when kids are in school. In my area, a school day is 6 hours. Most office jobs are 9 hours. That\u2019s 8 hours with 1 hour lunch break. If you have to commute that\u2019s even more time. It can be difficult to find part time childcare, and it\u2019s expensive. Especially if the childcare provides after school transportation. Busses are not available for every student here. You have to live a certain distance away from the school. Parents working schedules do not qualify a child for the bus. The schools have aftercare programs, but many of them require waiting lists because they don\u2019t have enough staff to handle a lot of kids. Added to that, is what to do if your child gets sick. They can\u2019t go to school, they\u2019ll get sent home. If you don\u2019t have PTO you are losing money and can possibly lose your job. \n\n\nAll of this is exactly why my ex husband and I remained only 5 minutes from each other. We were able to put our personal issues aside to make sure our kids were fully supported by both parents and neither of us had to worry about losing our jobs if the kids needed someone at home, since we would trade off calling out. OP\u2019s entire post feels like these parents need to work together. If mom wasn\u2019t doing drugs, having mental health issues, or abusing her son this should not have escalated like this.", "It sounds like she was a stay at home but when they divorced she didn\u2019t have anything like stable income or home to fall back on (and is a risk for when you\u2019re a stay at home parent and the breadwinner rips the rugs  out) which likely is why he got fully custody and possibly he was able to throw his money at a good lawyer (how he talks it sounds like he\u2019s well off especially compared to his ex). He glossed over her financial situation so I\u2019m not picturing someone who is trying to rake in hundreds of thousands with some \u201chotshot\u201d job but someone getting on their feet and trying to build some sort of life. He also doesn\u2019t mention if she got large amount of money in the divorce that we could say she\u2019s a bad spender. Like with a lot of OPs information that can make other people involved more reasonable is withheld, downplayed or hidden in the replies. And yes it\u2019s possible they\u2019re both horrid parents."]}
