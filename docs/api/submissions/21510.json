We all go to the same college and live off campus. Emma and I both moved in last month, and didn\u2019t know each other until Sarah was looking for roommates and introduced us. We\u2019ve been becoming decent friends but we\u2019re still not super close.\n\nI just realized last night that the guy Emma\u2019s been dating for the past couple months\u2014 \u201cMichael\u201d (25F)\u2014 is a guy that also goes to our college who had an obsessive crush on me last year. It was the first time she\u2019d had him over while I was also home, and when I walked in the door and saw him I just made an excuse to run to my room and hid there until he left. After he left I came out and told her I knew him and some of the vague history, and told her I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with him being in our house.\n\nEmma got upset and emphasized that it is *our* house and if they\u2019re minding their own business then she has every right to have him over. I told her she\u2019s right in principle but that I don\u2019t trust him to mind his own business. She said I need to get over myself. We asked Sarah for her opinion and she suggested what if Emma only has Michael over in her room and not in the common areas since Emma\u2019s got her own en suite bathroom he wouldn\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to leave her room besides to go in and out of the front door.\n\nI said that\u2019s not good enough for me and eventually Sarah sided with me. Emma just said okay & goodnight then went to her room. A couple hours ago she texts me & Sarah that she broke up with Michael because she doesn\u2019t know she could have a relationship with someone she can never have over to her place.\n\nI didn\u2019t wanna tell her she should break up with him but I\u2019m honestly glad she did. However, I feel like i might be TA for suddenly upending a relationship she seemed to be happy in.\n\nEDIT for INFO: A lot of you are asking for elaboration on Michael\u2019s \u201cobsessive crush\u201d, saying I was too vague to you all and possibly to Emma. I\u2019m sorry for not explaining enough. Michael and I used to be friends, and he\u2019d essentially get me drunk so he could spend time alone with me and do things I didn\u2019t want to do while sober. He was also really jealous about other guys I was friends with and wouldn\u2019t fully leave me alone for about 8 months after I eventually ended our friendship. \n\nEssentially all I told Emma was that we used to be friends, he was obsessed with me and very possessive and that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable having him in our house. I definitely should\u2019ve explained more to her but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it last night and I don\u2019t blame her for not understanding exactly what I meant", "created_utc": 1688668418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14shq0a/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_i_dont_want_her/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both OP and Emma have rights to the space and deserve a level of comfort in their own home. My thought on this situation though is that if one tenant has a serious problem with a guest, that guest is either not welcome or tolerated under very specific agreed upon circumstances.\n\nI'm voting NTA conditionally.  Emma is deserving to know more of the story here about OP's reasoning.  Maybe she'll see she dodged a bullet with that information.  Either way, she made the call to break up/martyr herself over this (what about his place?) so obviously this wasn't super serious.\n\nInfo: I'm assuming here the guy's behavior was so bad/traumatizing as to not warrant trying to coexist in new circumstances?", "If she broke up with him that easily, it would have happened anyway honestly. NAH", "NTA, he supplies booze to you underage, once drunk took advantage of you.  Once you realized what was going on and broke up, he more or less stalked you.  Here is the million-dollar question, did he know that you were Emma's roommate?  What was his real motive for dating Emma?  Then for them to break up so quickly over this makes one wonder.", "Originally YTA, after reading the Edit-NTA, if you were SA'd that's enough reason. But you need to explain that to her.", "NTA. I get that your roommate should be allowed to have people over, but not someone who makes you that uncomfortable for very legitimate reasons.", "INFO What did they guy do and how much did you tell your roommates about it? Some things are private but if you think this guy is dangerous that is worth sharing. \n\nStaying in your room with a partner isn't uncommon the partner never being allowed in shared spaces is.", "nta.... you have a right to feel comfortable in your own house, what your roommate does is her own decision.", "NTA and a little shocked by the all the Y T A votes\u2026 ofc Emma has a right to bring her boyfriend over but it\u2019s also your place and if you aren\u2019t comfortable with him for these incredibly valid reasons then I think that should override that. You deserve to feel safe in your own home", "YTA unless you can give more something to explain why having a crush means someone can never be in same room with you.", "YTA. She has every right to bring her boyfriend to her own home, and you need to be an adult and get over the fact that you have some awkward history with him.", "YTA. It\u2019s her boyfriend and it\u2019s a shared space. You don\u2019t dictate what can come in and out. You shouldn\u2019t have told Emma what to do based on a hunch. Also sounds like Sarah only agreed with you to avoid a conflict. Apologise to Emma and hopefully they get back together. It\u2019s such a silly thing to break up about.", "YTA because you can\u2019t mind your business. Your vague excuse of \u201cobsession over you\u201d isn\u2019t helpful to the story and more makes it seem like it\u2019s the opposite \ud83e\udd14 but on the other hand she probably didn\u2019t break up with him but is saying that for you to change your mind or if they did break up\u2026it wasn\u2019t gunna work out anyways. \n\nY\u2019all grow up \u270c\ud83c\udffc", "YTA for thinking you have the right to prevent him from visiting.

You made Emma feel uncomfortable in her own home, even after Sarah presented a good compromise.

He also tried to get me to stop hanging out with other guys and tried to make every time we hung out into a date.

I can't make a judgement without a clear definition.", "She just did a follow up, this guy was stalking and harassing her.", "You buried the lead. Yikes yikes yikes. That's a lot more than \"obsessive crushing\". Crushes are innocent and harmless, but this sounds evil. Like he wanted to get you in a corner to say yes to something you didn't want to do kind of evil. \n\nNTA times 1000. I wouldn't want that guy near me at all, let alone my house. You are completely in the right here. How Emma could do that to you (if she knows that backstory) is wild.", "NTA. Sounds like stalking and harassment more than a crush. You shouldn't have to put up with giving your stalker access to your home... I would suggest telling Emma the full extent of your history with this guy though. Just so she has more context to understand why you're so uncomfortable around him, and honestly for her own safety.", "Ahh... the old creepy/angry \"nice guy\".\n\nI probably would have gone w/ the compromise w/ the cavaet that if he does ANYTHING to make you uncomfortable, he needs to leave at that moment and he is banned. However, you are NTA for sticking to your guns on this one.\n\nThe banning from the home is probably not what made her break up w/ him. It is more likley she was able to further reflect on what you told her or she had a conversation with him that revealed his creepy/angry \"nice guy\" self.\n\nYou now have 2 women in one home that rejected this guy. Do you live in a secure building w/ cameras? If not, I would get some cameras. If you can't afford them, see if your parents would gift them to you. If you feels uncomfortable telling your roommates, you are nervous about this guy, just tell them your parents were nervous about you living off campus and got the door cameras for you. Also, I would lock down my social media for awhile. Better safe than sorry w/ the creepy/angry \"nice guy\"."]}
