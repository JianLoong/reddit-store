A valuable lesson.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. If she\u2019s old enough to have a driving license she KNOWS not to text and drive. Next time she\u2019ll he more responsible when driving a vehicle that is not hers. Plus that could have resulted in a serious car crash/ hurt a third party.\nYour sister needs to mind her business and let you parent your kid.", "NTA \n\nThe money is the direct cost of her actions. Not an arbitrary punishment. This is definitely an example of natural consequences. \n\n\nThough, how much has insurance gone up? Insurance covered the damage, but which would have been a higher cost? The $3k out of pocket, or the increased liability on her insurance? Because that should actually be factored into the consequence.", "NTA. For the most part, anyway. Maybe you could have left her a percentage (20-50%), but that\u2019s really just quibbling. It\u2019s not theft, it\u2019s restitution, or a life lesson in responsibility.", "NTA, instead of just messing up the wheels and axles, she could have hit a pedestrian or another car. While taking the whole paycheck each time is kind of harsh, it's a life lesson and could have been so much worse.", "NTA. The amount you will be paying in increased insurance over time is considerable. Especially since you are putting the money in her college fund. It was an expensive lesson but she was careless.", "NTA\n\nQuite frankly she should have her license taken away for what she did.  Texting while driving is a good way to have a serious accident and she could have hit someone.\n\nMaking her pay for the damage is effectively letting her off and she should be thankful to learn a lesson so cheaply.", "NTA\n\nThough I think it should have been more of a payment plan to mimic how adult life is going to go. Child needs to learn consequences. \n\nYour sister needs to check herself. She's not the parent", "NTA.  It was not her insurance, not her car, and she could have hurt someone. She's a child under your roof and someone has to pay for it.  You insisted she *get* a job to pay off the damages, too.  So you entered a discussion/agreement.  That's not stealing in any sense of the word.", "NTA. You're teaching her actions have consequences. It wasn't an accident either, it was negligence. She could've killed herself or someone else. This will at least hammer home she needs to drive safely. You're saving her life being firm and enforcing this life lesson.", "NTA this isn\u2019t about money, this is about the lesson and hoping like hell that this will suck enough that the next time she considers texting and driving, she makes the smart choice and comes home safe.", "your NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n. your kid needs to learn a bunch of things and sharpish\n\n1. life has consequences and she was lucky this time . my 9 year old knows that if she breaks her expensive stuff through mistreatment she pays for the repairs.  you kid evidently does not.\n2. dont fucking txt or call and drive pull over. a couple of tons of metal isnt very forgiving again she is lucky she didnt kill or injure someone or herself.\n3. \"debts\" have to be paid off and you need to earn money to pay for things. she can always do extra hours.  (on that note i would say that ALL of the income is a bit harsh make up a payment plan so she knows whats being paid for and for how long)\n4. your sister needs to realize that your kid is being punished for bad behavior that caused a financial hassel that she should be the one to fix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister is being the AH for trying to control how you discipline your kid after a serious issue.\n\nand possibly your kid as well if they have given a tailored version of events her\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit . given that the money is being paid into a college fun its not like the kid is actually losing the money its more being delayed. its being used as a life lesson and creating some additional savings instead of being flitted away on junk", "NTA. You're not stealing it. You're paying back what she owed for the damage she caused. Since it made your insurance go up, that's a bit more EVERY MONTH.

Is it the deductible + increase in insurance? Is she paying more than that?", "Info needed: are you taking the deductible you had to pay? That\u2019s fine. But if you are taking the whole cost of the repairs, even the part you didn\u2019t have to pay for, what are you doing with that money?

If she \\*agreed\\* to that...Sis is outta line. None of her business. Kid could have died! She got off easy and learned a lesson, too! NTA. People \\*need\\* to be held accountable.

And that makes you somewhat an AH. I think it\u2019s better that you agree on an amount to be given to you and with a deadline. It should be a very reasonable cost. Lets say, it can be the increase of your insurance. It\u2019s a good lesson to learn - to be responsible and that all mistakes have consequences.\n\nAlso, I think the sister is an AH for not knowing her boundaries.", "INFO: if insurance paid for it and you don\u2019t need the money for a deductible, why are you taking her entire paycheck? The logical consequence here was to have her pay the increase in insurance, maybe her phone bill or something since she was on her phone while driving. Maybe lose phone and/or driving privileges for a bit. But taking her whole pay check seems extreme even if you are saving it for her. ESH.", "NTA if you're putting it in a college account, but you may want to tell her about that so she doesn't hate you", "NTA. I\u2019m laughing because this is totally something my mom would have done if I had done this as a teenager. Honestly, super generous that you\u2019re putting this in a college fund. She needs to learn a lesson. She\u2019s lucky she or someone else didn\u2019t get hurt or that the damage wasn\u2019t even worse than that!", "NTA thats a reasonable punishment for being irresponsible", "ESH.\nCourts cant even legally take 100% of your paycheck. You should have made it a legal percentage so she could see how the real world works. Missed an opportunity to teach a lesson accurately without being a straight prick robbing her \"pocket change\".", "You could let her keep at least some of it.\n\nShe won't see any point in working in that place if you take 100% of the money every time. She might just quit or end up being a bad server.\n\nEven when you have debts with banks and such they won't take your entire paycheck.", "Soft YTA - right idea, but too intense.\n\nYou are inflating the consequences of her actions. When adults owe money there is a monthly plan. She should not be working and getting absolutely nothing for herself - that won't do much for work ethic and taking pride in earning her way.\n\nIt will teach her more about actual consequences and money management if she owes a monthly fee to pay this off and gets to save and budget the rest of her money.", "NTA if you only collet the $3,000 she caused in damages. YTA if you take any of her paycheck beyond the $3,000 that she's responsible for.", "Very, very soft ESH?  \n\n\nYour kid was texting and driving and that could have been serious. Minor child so won't say AH, but - woot, definite consequences REQUIRED.   \n\n\nYour sister shouldn't be stepping in.  \n\n\nYou shouldn't be taking the entire paycheck. Figure out what your daughter owes you - an achievable payback - and discuss with her the means by which she will pay it back.", "INFO\n\nIf you're taking more than you paid out of pocket to fix the car, YTA. If you haven't told her you're putting the money away and not putting it in your own pocket, YTA. If you're taking 100% of her paycheck, YTA.\n\nNone of those \"punishments\" match what would happen in real life, they're actually *more* cruel and teach your daughter that you're a cruel authoritarian. In real life, she would have to pay *only* what the insurance did not cover. She would not have to pay it all upfront, she could finance it and use other parts of her income for other things.", "YTA for taking 100% of her pay which sounds like more than what the accident costs you if insurance covered it. I am assuming this due to lack of clarity. \n\nYour objective is for your daughter to learn from her mistake. Are you achieving this or are you just so angry that you want someone to suffer for it? The latter is an AH move.", "I presume you are only charging her the excess fee, and not the full amount. Why? Because that\u2019s all YOU paid. And you aren\u2019t out of pocket $3000. Sure do what you are doing. But be honest about it. You KNOW it\u2019s not $3000. Getting her to pay the excess is fair. For you to benefit from it financially is NOT.", "Collecting 100% of her paycheck is the AH part. The rest I fully agree with, and everybody should have to have a customer service work experience like that. Also texting while driving is also wrong, this is a fair consequence.\n\nMaybe just take half to put in her college account. Is the account to pay for tuition or is it for her to have some spending money in college?", "NAH I like that you are not just keeping the money but putting it towards something beneficial for her future, teaching her 2 lessons - responsibility for her actions and that making amends benefits her in the long run.", "YTA. \n\nProbably don\u2019t need to take the whole pay check that\u2019s a bit serious and much no? Take half use your own money to pay the other half and make her pay the other half next pay check at least then she still has some money to save towards something. Although taking all she will definitely learn her lesson but she will hate you and apparently your sister will too, you are right to make her pay for her actions though it could have went different and she should know better.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOP is putting that 3000 into her college funds so it\u2019s not going to complete waste just for repairs. I still think she should be able to keep a little she definitely learned her lesson.", "YTA big time. Yes, she should be punished but forcing her to pay something insurance covered is just vindictive.", "Info: What's the lesson? Please explain the lesson you are teaching her. I'm not even being sarcastic. \n\nIs it she has to pay for her mistakes? Not to text and drive? What amount are you and your wife paying for mistakenly letting a teenager who wasn't ready drive? I don't recall forced labor the last time I had a wreck, so please enlighten us.", "ESH.  Insurance paid for it, you don't need the money, and you're taking the entire check. \n\nWhen the legal system fines you, they don't take the entire check.  You're not teaching her the correct lesson.  You're over compensating.", "YTA.  Your taking all of her money.  Is there an end to this?  Is there a certain amount she has to pay back or are you going to punish her forever.  Kids do stupid things and need appropriate punishments.  This seems over the top.", "YTA.  I think if you wanted to teach her a lesson about responsibility and the dangers of driving while texting, you should make her pay for the deductible and the increased insurance rates but not for the entire repair.  Because I assume you're going to pocket the money and not offer it back to your insurance company?  That would be you profiting off of the accident and payout.", "YTA. Doesn\u2019t seem like an effective way to actually teach a lesson, seems more like you just want to be a dick", "YTA. Wth is this. I understand making her pay off the car debt is fair game but taking her WHOLE paycheck is messed up. You should allow her to make partial payments. This had potential to teach her responsibilities yet you guys managed to come up with such a silly lesson.", "YATA\n\nWhile your intentions are noble, and the money is still going toward her future, that doesn't change the fact that it is still HER money, and it should be up to her to decide how she spends it.\n\nYou should have talked with her about how much you think you are owed and on how to pay it. You know a budgeting lesson. If you are just taking the money without her consent all it will breed is mistrust, and at worst resentment.\n\nAnother angle you may want to consider is her sense of autonomy. At 16 that is something they usually value, and dictating things may put a strain on that sense she is developing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But mistakes sometimes have big consequences. This isn\u2019t an eye for an eye moment. If someone ruined something valuable of yours wouldn\u2019t you want to be paid back for that? This was a punishment for texting and driving and damaging a car. I\u2019m sure these parents are still going to make sure their child is well fed and has what the need. One summer\u2019s worth of fast food pay isn\u2019t going to make a huge difference, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll make her think twice about doing this again.

They are instead making her pay for something that insurance paid for, that\u2019s not a lesson that\u2019s just being a dick.

Still having to deal with a rental or other ways of transportation while the car is being fixed all adds up. I still stand by what I said as you compared this to child abuse, was just a bit extreme if you ask me. Clearly you would make a different choice, so whatever.

In the real world it would be a percentage of your income.", "ESH and you wouldn't be an asshole in my eyes if it wasn't the whole paycheck.

You are holding your daughter accountable and I love the idea that you are putting what she pays into her college account (don't tell her that just yet). \n\nI lived with my parents for the last year before I got married and paid them rent, even though they didn't ask me to. When I got married they gave me that rent money to pay off my car so we started marriage free of debt.", "Nta.

My parents hauled my entitled butt to a junk yard to find the parts to fix my car.  I got a short window to find myself a job within walking distance.  But only half of every paycheck went to fixing the car, not all of it.  Took longer to pay back but I got to see some benefit of working and I kept working after it was paid off.", "Well, there is almost always a deductible and where I live, points that impact insurance rates last for 10 years.

OP could have called a tow truck to bring the car to a body shop and paid to get it fixed, not going through insurance at all.

Parents doing parent things. Good for them.\n\nThe same lessons could be taught even if a payment plan was implemented. Is OP's daughter still doing summer activities? Seeing movies? Going out with friends?

For the college? It\u2019s their choice.", "I\u2019m assuming in 6 years the kid will have her own policy to pay for. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I envisioned a monthly increase of like 20-50, assuming a couple hundred over the year.

Maybe some emergency savings but I would call this a super emergency and wouldn\u2019t pull the money for that", "I haven't paid attention - but it was 10 years in my state - but if you have a single-car accident causing under so much, that might only be one or two points, which means 2-3 years of good driving will offset the point, but it would take another year or two to get a safe-driver credit. So, effectively, it only lingers for your policy 3-5 years. But the insurer still keeps a record of it. Moving violations are also points.\n\nOr that was my understanding when they mailed out to all the residents when they changed the law.", "Seriously. Our kid did $2k of damage to his own. We kept it off ins, paid it and had him pay us back. We took 50% of paychecks til it was done. I'm sure the insurance increase would be following all of us around for years to come PLUS put a black mark on his record with all of the insurance industry.", "I think it\u2019s much more important to have a hard lesson and never risk her doing that horrible idea ever again. Feeling can be forgotten but having to work to pay it off will be a strong memory \n\nSometimes being harsh is the way to go.", "I assume she's not allowed to do any of that, I dunno, I'm not her parents. \n\nI just mean the \"debt collector\" analogy is flawed - they don't care if they make you homeless or you don't have enough to eat. Taking her pocket money (money she earned but doesn't need to live off of) and putting towards her college fund is not the same as someone garnishing your full-time job salary.", "Wouldn\u2019t she still be paying the parent even with her own policy. The parents rates will still be messed up even when she gets off unless they have a policy we\u2019re it goes down with less people", "Obviously if they didn't have the $3k (or couldn't come up with a payment plan with the body shop), that's not a possibility. But as they are just putting away all the money their daughter is giving them, and paying the higher insurance premiums, it sounds like they do.", "Yea, OP'S daughter should definitely be paying. But, as the adult, and the one with the insurance policy, OP really should have thought more about the options. If she is paying for the damage that insurance paid for AND will have to pay more insurance costs when she's older, then she's being charged in both directions. I don't know OP'S plan, though. And if insurance knows who was driving.", "Yea, I think you're right. But paying the deductible and the cost of the insurance increase seems sufficient but that's my opinion.", "Well she should be currently insured under her parents\u2019 policy. So, this should follow her to her own policy unless her parents lied when they put a claim in and took the blame for the damage themselves. In which case they committed insurance fraud and honestly should take over that premium once she has her own policy for their own bad decision making.", "I know people who would rather pay a fine than follow the law. I think their question about what is being taught is important here.", "And there are plenty of ways to punish and teach from this that isn't just monetary. Last thing we need is more people thinking that you can buy your way out of laws.", "It does sound like they are comfortable but 3000 is still a lot. They may have figured it was cheaper to do the insurance in the long run then pay 3000 out of pocket.\n\nWe don\u2019t know since we don\u2019t know how much their insurance went up", "It\u2019s a fair opinion. I think it\u2019s probably not punitive enough though for her to fully comprehend the magnitude of what could have gone wrong.", "That's why I asked....\n\n\nIf there is $3k worth of damage by a teenager, insurance will probably go up quite a bit.", "It\u2019s mind blowing to me that you are so triggered over this. I said I understand it multiple times, just don\u2019t understand why you are comparing the two. Somehow my teeny tiny brain was able to comprehend your \u201cvery simple\u201d comparison lol. Your approach is just super aggressive. But who am I to argue with a physicist?"]}
