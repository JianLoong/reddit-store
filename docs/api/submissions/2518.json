Please get some therapy or something. Seriously, you don't seem to be in a good place right now.", "If I were his mother, I surely would not.", "Agreed. She didn\u2019t have it on for much longer than 5 minutes, the time it took OP to pick a fight and get out of the engagement. I\u2019m so happy she moved on and found someone decent. The same thing happened to someone who refused to commit until I found someone better than him in every. Then he was furious", "THIS RIGHT HERE.  Mela finally woke up, faced reality and moved on with her live without OP. He needs to let his bitterness and hurt go and move on with his life and not be a greedy asshole.", "Yeah...poor guy...NOT", "RIGHT?! I'm like how does he think Mela actually regrets the fact that they broke up? OP is bitter that she's moved on and it looks like he hasn't. Come on dude, you need to face reality here, it'll be much better for you in the long run.", "Love this - I'm going to have to steal it!", "Not exactly. She gave it to me a year before I proposed", "This. I would bet the ring is gone already.", "This is exactly where my mind went. With as hell bent as he is about not giving the ring back, it's probably already gone because he sold it.", "Probably a combination of the ring is nice and she wants something fancy to wear, and she just wants her freaking ring back. OP is only weirdness here. Edit to add that if I didn't get my ring back, OP could just figure the ring is his only inheritance. I wouldn't leave him anything else.", "i mean, it is HER engagement ring that her husband handmade for her. i agree the timing is weird but judging by OP stunt now, i imagine she has been putting it off so as not to face OP's immaturity. i'm also thinking that Mela must have known it was mom's ring, so maybe she doesn't want to show up at the wedding without it and make Mela think that OP isn't giving the ring back bc he's still hung up on her.\n\nthat's all conjecture though lol", "Lol I\u2019m saying. OP is like \u201cit\u2019s stealing when someone keeps my things but not when I keep theirs\u201d \u2026\u2026whaaa?", "No, it would be incredibly entitled for him to even ask.", "Yeah cause seems like you envy him.", "Good women would be happy with a ringpop.

Why exactly do you want to keep it anyway?  What is your actual reason for coveting the ring?", "So, right around when Mela was really starting to put pressure on you to propose, but before the ultimatum. You really are trying any which way you can to be like \"but it totally wasn't just about the proposal, and keeping it totally isn't about punishing my parents for still being good enough friends with Mela to be invited to her wedding with her new fiance\" aren't you?", "I agree it's probably her nicest ring and means a lot to her so why wouldn't she want to wear her nicest jewelry to a upscale wedding. OP really is the only weird person in this whole situation.", "If he is uncomfortable with it he is welcome to ask. The right way to approach this would be to give the ring back, voice his concerns, maybe discuss it if necessary, then it ultimately being his mom's decision.", "You didn't even want to get married...and no sir. Good women would want to feel valued . She leveled up. You're bitter, get over it", "Now we know why she left you", "I can\u2019t believe she wasted 7 years on you. She\u2019s lucky she found someone who values her.", "YTA   \n\n\nYou keep proving it and you keep proving you don't even respect your mother- much less any other woman.  \n\n\nGive back the ring.

That's a legitimate place to be emotionally. \n\nShe wants to be married. Also legitimate. \n\nShe doesn't want to wait around for another 4 years waiting for you to hopefully decide that maybe marriage is ok. That's legitimate, too. \n\nWhat's not legitimate is you refusing to return your mother's ring. It was made for her by her husband, she deserves to hang onto it until you actually want to get married, instead of keeping it for, what exactly? Possible maybe future use one day if you happen to meet someone and eventually decide you want to get married? \n\nQuit keeping something so sentimental from your mother. That ring was supposed to be a way to welcome your ex into the family and to know something that represented so much love go to the next generation of lovebirds. \n\nBut you soiled it by deciding something your mother loves now belongs to you and you're going to keep it from her. It was a beautiful symbol of acceptance and love and now you've decided, \"fuck that, it's mine now.\"\n\nYou, good sir, are an asshole.", "Right? Like, dude gonna wear that? Give me a break.", "The Preciousssssss", "Is anyone else getting an incel vibe?", "Yeah, but OP needs SOMETHING to feel morally superior about, and those 3 years are all he's got. Don't take the years away from him, man!", "A little over 4 years which is a lifetime of experience", "Either the ring has a strange power than makes the bearer strangly obsessed with it or he wants to sell it for weed or gaming money", "Yeah! For a 4 year old, which you're acting like one, it's a lifetime of experience!", "4 years is a lifetime of experience but 7 is insufficient to commit to a partner \ud83d\udc80", "Info: what is it that you gained from the 4year difference that substitutes a lifetime's worth of experience? It certainly was not maturity. \n\nInfo: did you ask your parents for help or advice when given the ultimatum? Did you ask for help needing a ring to propose with?\n\nPlease take a step back and try to look at this situation from a neutral lense. You understand your point of view. Can you try to understand it from an outside point of view?\n\nLiterally everyone is telling you YTA and there is nothing you can say to justify keeping the ring your father made for your mother.  Your mother and father both have much more symbolism and sentiments attached to that ring than you can fathom. Stop trying to justify yourself, take time to consider what everyone else is unanimously telling you. Allow yourself to grow and look past your personal perspective.", "Well, at least he'll have a lifetime of experiences with her and you won't."]}
