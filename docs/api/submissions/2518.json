Well after his last relationship ended he wanted more in the boys lives and I was not doing great financially due to medical issues. So when I asked him to buy some school supplies he threw a fucking fit. And then he goes out with his friends and buys video games. This is a common thing. Next I know poof he\u2019s gone again. So next time I ask my kids if they\u2019ve talked to him my younger says he\u2019s out with his gf Skye a lot and that\u2019s why he\u2019s busy but hasn\u2019t talked to him for weeks. I feel bad for my younger one, he\u2019s innocent and doesn\u2019t see it.I tell them nothing negative about him ever, but my teen just knows. Like one day I was like you\u2019re not gonna go to your dads? He says \u201che\u2019s not a dad\u201d I told him his dad loves him he just doesn\u2019t know exactly how to show it but my oldest is extremely intelligent. Even his kids outgrow him.", "I think he's just making excuses to keep the ring.", "That wouldn't make sense she would know the right his mom wore", "Could also tip her off that he still hasn't gotten his life together and used it to propose to anyone else, which could also compound OPs butthurt...", "This is exactly what I was thinking.", "ok its definitely giving crack head I sold it and cant get it back energy", "I guarantee he sold it", "Maybe He lost the RING. But he is saying all of this because he is embarrassed. Coz his dad made it.", "Also love his excuse that Mela will be upset to see his mom wearing the ring, nah man I think she\u2019s happy with who she\u2019s marrying, don\u2019t doubt her happiness.", "You're mistaken. It was OP's *MOTHER'S* ring.", "Plot twist, OP is going through all these gymnastics because he probably already pawned the ring.\n\nIf not, give it back OP. YTA", "And mental gymnastics to act like his ex is somehow now miserable and suffering because she\u2019s not with him and seeing the old ring will suddenly trigger her remorse. YTA, OP. She moved on with her life. you should too.", "He\u2019s sold it, I\u2019ll bet.", "Most likely he sold the ring and doesn't want to admit to theft. He's definitely a YTA situation.", "Yes I still look at houses on Zillow I bought a house almost 3 years ago now it\u2019s a mild hobby at best", "YUP. And it  also makes OP even more of a jerk (if possible) for refusing to return it.", "Yup- - totally agree.", "OP is definitely focusing all his hurt feelings about his ex getting married and his mom attending the wedding on the ring, as if that's really the problem here.", "She won for sure I\u2019m glad she left him", "Exactly you are so right", "OP really brought up her Pinterest wedding board, as evidence that she was obsessed with marriage \ud83e\udd23 Almost every girl/woman I know has a Pinterest \u201cwedding vision board\u201d where they save ideas they like. Even people who aren\u2019t sure they want to get married someday save wedding ideas to Pinterest. Having a Pinterest board and wanting a definitive yes/no after 4 *years* together, hardly qualifies as someone being \u201cobsessed with marriage\u201d. OP could win a gold medal in mental gymnastics with that one.", "Remind HIM that she won is more like it.", "The ring is precious to me\u2026\u2026\nOr\nThe ring is mine.\nSorry Gollum you\u2019re TA", "Dude you suck so much in every line of this post lol yeah, YTA. For more reasons than you know.", "What is wrong with you \ud83d\ude02 YTA.", "YTA give her her ring back. Maybe if you decide to propose again she will give it back to you, again.", "YTA. Mela dodged a bullet.", "This and OP is probably mad and upset at mum that she will go to his ex's wedding and is being a little brad.yta", "Note how AH OP made the statement that Mela didn't like the mom's ring but graciously accepted it and how OP KNEW the price of the new ring (jealous much). I wish the GF didn't waste so many years with this man.", "Every single one of my friends and I have a wedding themed Pinterest board out there somewhere", "\u201cY O U *apostrophe* R E means \u2018you are\u2019,\u2026. Y O U R means YOUR!!\u201d", "The ring isn\u2019t her style or size, but she totally wants it over a $15k ring that likely is to her style. Totally.", "Yikes - that's a lot of drama.  And its so sad that your kids are a part of it now. At least the eldest realizes whats going on and I'm thinking may go NC/LC with dad. But its gotta be hard on teh younger one.  You're such a strong person to make it out and raise some good kids!", "Right?  Keeping a great mother in law is amazing after breakup.  She kept mom, clearly the best choice!  Good moms always are", "Yeah, it didn\u2019t skip my attention that he pointed out the cost of the ring. It clearly bothers him how nice her current ring is.", "So not being married/engaged means your life is in shambles?", "Your Mum didn\u2019t give you the ring, technically she gave Mela. She saw her as someone she could call her daughter in-law and was willing to part with a significant object ( you said your dad made it). It\u2019s not yours to keep. Do you think she\u2019ll be happy if you give it to someone she dislike. GIVE IT BACK", "YTA  \n\n\n7 years and you still don't know if you want to get married or not? YTA for stringing her along. Dude, your 28. Make up your mind.\n\n  \nYour mom wants her ring back and you won't give it back. SHE GAVE IT TO YOU TO PROPOSE and not to you personally. YTA ... A BIG ONE.", "He'll get up during the, \"Should anyone present know of any reason that this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace\" moment, go out into the aisle, knell down and declare his love while holding out the ring and expect her to throw herself into his arms crying, \"Yes!  I'll marry you!\"", "Honestly. I thought this was going to say that Mela still had it and he didn't feel comfortable asking for it back. Wtf does he want with the ring anyway? Probably doesn't fit him.", "Those words are homophones in most places.", "WOW, THat's something else. Thanks to that OP, that woman not only escaped from his shitty bro but the rest of his family too. After 18 years! OMG...", "HA YOUR SO QUIRKY AND SILLY FOR CHANGING UP THE P AND THE N!", "He is 100% bitter, either because he's not over her, or because he's salty she upgraded.", "Oh shit! Glad tou caught taht. Man, I really shouldn't have let my Grammerly account lapse lol", "Give it back, OP. YTA.", "ESH Now while I absolutely agree he needs to give the ring back, and while he is the biggest asshole here I voted everybody sux since mum planned to wear THAT ring to her wedding.  THat is absolutely tacky and messed up.   Reminding the bride of her ex relationship  on her wedding day by wearing what was the brides engagement ring, she would right away recognize.  IMHO that is even worse then wearing white.  How is nobody talking about that part ?", "Yeah I just really didn\u2019t vibe with how he presented her as \u201cmarriage crazy\u201d. It\u2019s very cliche of men to throw that \u201cshe\u2019s xyz crazy\u201d at women and I find it really unfair. It\u2019s okay to want different things, neither preference is better or worse than the other just own it and go your separate ways with respect.\n\nEdit to add: this post was supposedly about the ring and a disagreement between him and his mother and yet he found a way to throw his ex under the bus anyway. So like, idk man, I think he\u2019s probably just a dick.", "Yup! Why would she when she is with someone who agrees with her and gets her something she wants without an ultimatum?"]}
