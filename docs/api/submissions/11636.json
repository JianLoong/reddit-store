The plan was to travel for two months for different countries of Europe, Asia and Africa. We currently are in Spain and we are supposed to take a plane to Morocco in two days. However my husband wants to cut the trip short and go back to our home now. \n\nThe thing is his brother is in a horrible situation, his wife and daughter had a car crash and they're on the hospital. The kid is fine but his wife has to be a little longer in the hospital, that's all I know. I told my husband that I understand he wants to support his brother but that he's not a doctor so he can't do anything to help really. And his brother's wife is fine, she probably only has a broken leg or something and that's why she needs some more days in the hospital. I told him to just call his brother and ask to talk with his wife so he can send her his best wishes and that's all that he can do honestly. His parents and his in laws are helping with the kids so there's really nothing they need help in. I told him our honeymoon was important because it's a time for ourselves to enjoy and spend together. \n\nHe wasn't having any of it, he called me selfish and then he kicked me out of our bedroom, I had to ask for a new one until he decided to let me in again. He told me that he's leaving tomorrow because he needs to be supportive of his brother and told me I can continue the trip by myself. But that's not the point of s honeymoon at all, I told him so and he said that if he would've known how bitchy I was he would've never dated me.

I don't know if, at your age, you appreciate the exceptional position you are in, especially in contrast with a life endangering car accident.\n* Despite not being a doctor yourself and with little to no information, you are vastly minimizing the physical damage done to you in-laws.  *Conveniently* for you, this dis-information supports your entitled opinion to stay on your incredible honeymoon\n* You show ZERO sympathy or empathy to the situation.  Not a good look for a young spouse to show to their SO and their family.  It's the type of behavior that makes people sit down and reconsider their relationship with you.\n\nNow, here's why you've already lost the fight.  Your (STBX?) husband has:\n\n* told you face to face that you're wrong and selfish\n* kicked you, his new wife, out of the bedroom!!!  Out of the bedroom on the honeymoon, of all times!!!\n* is leaving to go home\n* told you face to face that he's reconsidering his relationship with you and not only has doubts, he has ***REGRETS***\n\nLet's finish with some more reality:\n\n* Your honeymoon is ***OVER*** and there's nothing you can do about it except to accept it\n* Your marriage is hanging by a thread and the only way you can save it at this point is to admit you have been acting incredibly entitled and selfish, profusely apologize and go back home with your husband.\n\nTo sum up - you've screwed up royally, your honeymoon is over and your marriage is very close to being over.  You need to grow up and learn some sympathy and empathy for others.\n\nYTA (of course).", "Well, I hope you enjoyed your three weeks of marriage. Family comes before a honeymoon.

I think you both are wrong because you couldn\u2019t simply talk, understand each other, and reach a conclusion. This is why a lot of relationships fail.

Also, it really seems like you would be on the other side of this, if it was you or your husband in the hospital; by which I mean, in that case, you would be offended and hold grudge against anyone that didn\u2019t deem your terrible accident bad enough to support you. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have kicked you out /locked you out of the hotel room.  I do wonder how that part of the story would sound if he were telling it, but assuming your version is fact. It was an AH move.

You don't have contacts for your in laws? How long were y'all dating before marriage? Have you spent any time with your in laws?  It's all just super odd. \n\nBut I do think YTA here. Family comes first, to a lot of people. And you're not acting like family. No way in hell could I marry someone who wouldn't be there for me if an immediate family member was hospitalized. You've already had a nice honeymoon, certainly nicer than most folks'. But you're only thinking of yourself. It doesn't matter if other family members are helping. That's his brother, SIL, and niece!

There are times when people need to be in the hospital for a few days but their injuries aren't that horrible (and by that I mean not life threatening, and no permanent damage), and if that's the situation, then I would understand not wanting to cut short your honeymoon.

You are right that in that even if he goes back there is nothing he could have really done to help. I don\u2019t know if the rest of your trip was refundable or not, so I\u2019m that part that would have been tons of wasted money.

I\u2019d think most people would discourage their loved ones from cutting a honeymoon short unless circumstances were pretty dire. \n\nIf the brother and parents are telling your husband that this is bad enough to cut the trip short, that speaks volumes.

A member of your husband's family specifically his brother and his brother's wife are in a very dire situation whether you think so or not. These are people he loves and cares about and it doesn't matter how minor you think the accident is to him it is extremely important because this is his blood and his family. Of course he wants to go back there because these are people that mean a lot to him. For you to just blow it off and say you having a vacation and a good time is more important than this situation is very cold-hearted and honestly you should probably think about your priorities a little before your honeymoon turns into Divorce Court", "So since there's a lot going on here...

He shouldn't have been rude to you and you should also understand that his brother was injured and he wants to be there for his brother.", "YTA for not trying to figure out what's up with SIL.  \"She probably has a broken leg\" is wildly insufficient for someone staying multiple days in the hospital.  You don't at all sound like you've assessed \"do they need our help/how bad are things\" and instead are searching for justifications to not disrupt your honeymoon.\n\nMaybe you don't need to disrupt it!  But it's *alarming* that you haven't bothered to figure out why she's in the hospital still and are just randomly guessing.  It is your responsibility to be proactive and push your husband for details on this, you can't just \"assume he'd tell you if it was serious,\" as you said a few times in the comments.  *Being in the hospital for multiple days is serious*.\n\nIf you've asked and he's not told you, that is a problem.  If he wants to cut your honeymoon short, you do need to know the situation if you ask.\n\nI feel like the age gap here is playing some sort of role, but it's difficult to really say without more information.  It feels like at least a 50% chance this would turn into E S H with more info, but either way OP, you're definitely in the wrong here.", "[deleted]", "Yes YTA because it sounds like you're dismissing the situation without knowing how serious the wife's condition is, and also dismissing the fact that your husband is clearly distraught and won't be able to enjoy himself without knowing more about the situation.

The plan was to travel for two months for different countries of Europe, Asia and Africa. We currently are in Spain and we are supposed to take a plane to Morocco in two days. However my husband wants to cut the trip short and go back to our home now. \n\nThe thing is his brother is in a horrible situation, his wife and daughter had a car crash and they're on the hospital. The kid is fine but his wife has to be a little longer in the hospital, that's all I know. I told my husband that I understand he wants to support his brother but that he's not a doctor so he can't do anything to help really. And his brother's wife is fine, she probably only has a broken leg or something and that's why she needs some more days in the hospital. I told him to just call his brother and ask to talk with his wife so he can send her his best wishes and that's all that he can do honestly. His parents and his in laws are helping with the kids so there's really nothing they need help in. I told him our honeymoon was important because it's a time for ourselves to enjoy and spend together. \n\nHe wasn't having any of it, he called me selfish and then he kicked me out of our bedroom, I had to ask for a new one until he decided to let me in again. He told me that he's leaving tomorrow because he needs to be supportive of his brother and told me I can continue the trip by myself. But that's not the point of s honeymoon at all, I told him so and he said that if he would've known how bitchy I was he would've never dated me.

I bet your marriage is over now.", "YTA 100% \n\nYes, you are really wrong here. \n\nThe fact that you can't see how selfish you re being is actually sad. You don't have to be a doctor to support a family member in the hospital. Just being there is enough. Your BIL is going through an extremely difficult time and you think that your honeymoon is more important?? Vacations can be postponed.

Since he is more emotional you will not be able to convince him with logic and vice versa. \n\nI would recommend couples counceling as soon you are back, bc you will resent him for the lost honeymoon and he resents you for not blindly following his emotional decisions. This will end bad if you aren't willing to see eachothers pov and how to handle this difference in your personalities.", "YTA.

The BIL wasn't involved, so he can help care for his wife. His kid is also apparently (mostly) unhurt and sounds like overall the injuries are minor to the wife. Plus BIL has other family support. So I get you, what is your husband really going to be able to do?\n\nAll the same though, if your husband isn't going to be able to enjoy his vacation because of this, you don't have much option here. He's going to resent you and make the vacation un-fun if you happened to arm twist him into staying. But then because you see these things at differing levels of severity, he breaks out insults and even kicks you out of the room? Even says he wouldn't have dated you.... Dude went way too far. And honestly, I have some concerns about his emotional stability if he can't hear news that family members are mildly hurt and not become verbally abusive towards you when it comes to how to respond to such injuries. Like, what happens when say his father becomes terminally ill? This is pretty big red flag that you have some serious troubles ahead of you.\n\nSo, this a bit of unbalanced-ESH, him way more than you, but also you. Even if he wasn't such a raging AH about this, you should probably defer to his judgement her given you require him to be a good state of mind to enjoy a vacation and it is his family.

But totally fair to leave your on your honeymoon plans to see family who have been injured.  \n\n\nIDK while I get the disappointment of shortening the honeymoon - I'd also be concerned if my partner was consistently worried or upset the entire remaining of the trip due to an incident back home.

Sorry, but I\u2019m the age of OP\u2019s husband and my friend\u2019s little sister is OP\u2019s age, and the maturity gap is huge! 8 year age gap between 20s and 30s is really big. I\u2019m 0% shocked that OP lacks the maturity, sensitivity and emotional intelligence to understand that her husband wants to come home bc she\u2019s too focused on wanting to have her own fun. Unfortunately loads of ppl in their early 20s are very self centered - that typically improves with age.

What will you do when you find yourself alone in America with no support system, and he kicks you out of the house because he's angry? \n\nDo not go to America with your husband, and do not lose sight of your passport: keep it with you at all times. \n\nPlease don't make a huge mistake: this is not a safe situation. You still have a chance to get out of this relatively easily.", "NTA but more importantly, if he's telling you he regrets dating you during your honeymoon, it's time to cut this marriage short. \n\nanyone who wishes out loud to me that they'd never met me gets the privilege of never knowing me again.", "I bet the sister in law is his wife or partner and the so called honey moon is the side piece", "OP married him for this trip.

There are so many red flags in this relationship that it is hard to know where to start.  \n\nFirst - You have a disagreement and HE KICKED YOU OUT OF YOUR ROOM AND YOU HAD TO RENT ANOTHER ROOM.  He is controlling, abusive, and apparently has no regard for your personal safety.  No matter how mad a spouse gets, he or she should NEVER (ever ever ever) do anything to put the other spouse at risk - ever.  This is a do-not-pass go moment.  Anyone who does this to you has no business being in your life.  Period.  \n\nSecond - The first major issue you have in your marriage and he tells you that if he had really known you, he wouldn't have even dated you.  Nice.  You've been married 3 weeks and this is how your new husband is treating you - on your honeymoon.  It's only going to get worse.  Perhaps there is a silver lining here though - you can clearly see his character early enough in the marriage to walk away cleanly. \n\nThird - He with holds information from you, telling you that you wouldn't understand, don't need to know, etc.  Again, controlling - and condescending.  This is not how a person treats their life partner.  Not just your SIL's condition, but information in general.  You said he is a private person - but this is not private, this is controlling.  And you have no way to contact your in-laws directly?  Not good.  Abusive people often control the flow of information to maintain control - keep the people they abuse in the dark, cut them off from others.  \n\nFourth - He makes unilateral decisions about things that affect both of you - and will not accept any discussion or input from you.  Again - controlling and not the behavior of a good partner.", "Do not move to the US. Get out of this marriage while you still can.

Sometimes it falls under my usual assessment, sometimes it doesn't.  I have friends who are pretty great together and they have a 6 year gap, and while he wasn't particularly immature when they met, he had lived a pretty care free life before that, so was just \"settling down\" to find a good long term partner, about 5 years after most of his peers had.  (She was 24, he was 30).  They just had enough future goals and lifestyle in common that it worked.\n\nWhen I say \"of a certain age\", I think it really starts to come into play when you're looking at age gaps around 7-8 years or more (unless you're talking about teenagers, then it can be way less).  Under that and it can just be a matter of a little bit of immaturity with different life paths.  Like in the couple listed above, he had undiagnosed ADHD, so had dropped out of college, had some casual jobs, spent lots of time recreating outdoors, and just took a few extra years to figure out what he wanted in life, but was ready to get serious about his future when he was about 27-28.  She was very driven all the way through college, graduated, spent a couple years living in the \"real world\", and if anything, his carefree, but serious and sincere attitude helped her chill out a little bit while not ignoring her goals.  When they met they were both a couple years into being \"real adults\", her the years 22-24, him the years 27-30.  So they were at a similar \"place\".\n\nWhen it works, it works...  but in this AITA case I was just pointing out that while most people think big age gaps are due to being controlling, sometimes it can be due to deep emotional immaturity (as the person I was responding to was pointing out how immature the husband was being)...  sounds like from additional comments in this case it ended up being the husband being a controlling AH.  Shocker!", "Yes, I completely agree, which is why I tried to hedge my comment by saying age gaps \"of a certain size\", the size obviously changing as they get older!\n\nIf you have mutual respect in your relationship, you're doing better than many people who have partners the same age as them!

Very suspicious. Sounds like he is playing some kind of game!\nIf this happened to me, honestly, I\u2019d probably be the first one to know. I would be in a family chat that my husband didn\u2019t read. But even still. What is the purpose of keeping her out of the loop? \nThis has all the signs of a con man or narcissist. \nBeware baby!", "NTA- think about getting your marriage annulled!", "Get an annulment and move on", "Nta. This is not normal. Not even a little. You need to run. You are supposed to be his partner/family now & part of his family. Yet he wont let you in the room for a phone call? He won't update you on her condition? Sounds like he has some deep dark secrets he is trying to make sure no one tells you. You deserve better", "NTA.  This is how the rest of your marriage will be.  Get out and save yourself now.", "Let me see if I understand this correctly. You are on the beginning of a two month honeymoon.  He wants to end it early because of his SIL being in the hospital from a car accident. He won't let you know the details of the accident or injuries. He won't let you be in the room while discussing on the phone with family, what is going on with the SIL. He kicked you out of the room and didn't let you in until you were going to have to spend money and get another room. Is it possible that he doesn't have the money to do this two month trip? That this is just a way to end the trip without you knowing the financial situation? Does he hide his financials or other things from you? Can you confirm the accident and condition of SIL? Something seems off from the little bit I know.", "After other context here, is OP sure husband is telling the truth?", "NTA. Confusing. When your husband is on the phone call your SIL, see how she is doing. Your marriage is already messed up a bit more behind the back stuff.", "NTA your hubby is being dramatic, sorry but it's true.  Everyone is fine (in relative terms) and there is absolutely no real reason he should be there other than his own personal feelings.", "NTA", "NTA, why is your husband being so vague and aggressive. This marriage sounds like a yikes and it just got started. \ud83d\ude33", "My exact thoughts upon finding out she\u2019s not a citizen. He is lied to her about his financial status and probably never even had the whole trip booked. I really hope we get an update.", "Bingo.", "Seconding this. Hoping that OP is ok and that OP\u2019s dad can get there soon!", "Walrus I think you need to read all of OPs comments and either add or edit judgment because this is a seriously f'd up story when fleshed out and I think an E S H at worst. Husband is an American  32m(supposedly-really I don't know if info he gave OP can be trusted) who went wife hunting in Thailand and gives her zero info. Of course she wanted the 2 month honeymoon to get to know him, she doesn't actually know him at all, she only knows \"foreign wife hunting\" him. This was a predatory marriage. I have to say NTA because she doesn't actually know the extent of the injuries because \"It's none of her business\".", "Based on the details of this sorry, couples therapy will not help this couple at all. She\u2019s in danger and she needs to get out now.", "Is the SIL pregnant with OPs husbands baby? That would be a medical condition he wouldn\u2019t want to share\u2026 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "right! if SIL\u2019s in serious condition and they need to be there to say goodbyes etc, he should tell his WIFE what\u2019s going on, im sure if she actually had context she\u2019d be understanding. but a 2 month trip across several continents is so expensive, and she doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s wrong with SIL, so i can 100% see why she doesn\u2019t want to leave right now", "I'm on OP's side here, once you get married your time together becomes very important. While she should have shown more empathy to SIL's health, I'm assuming they can't afford the cost or time to take another Europe vacation or honeymoon. In addition, once her health was going to influence OPs decisions and willingness to go along with having her honeymoon cancelled, SIL's health should have been shared. It sounds like he might be making stuff up so that he can fix a problem he doesn't want to tell OP about.", "I think op can go back with him from the \"honeymoon \" and get this marriage annulled. Get out of this marriage asap op. Good luck.", "When I married my husband, he was only visiting. We filed the I-130 and I-485 (status change, if living in the US). \nHe lived here for 15 years, then we moved to his home country for 7.\nMoving back...this time, he is in his home country so we filed I-130 and now DS-260 (the form used if one isn't currently in their home country.)\nSo it is possible that she hasn't filed yet and can start the process after she returns to the US. But if the process has already started, from my understanding, she should not be traveling outside the US (or to the US) while going through the process. \nAt least this is my experience.", "Getting married in the US on a tourist visa or any other non immigrant visa isn't a problem per se if you get married and leave like a non immigrant should. But re-entering the US on a tourist visa, while being married to a US citizen, signifies immigrant intention. 8 out of 10 times, the CBP guys won't let such people in. You need to demonstrate to them that you don't intend to stay in the US.", "The age gap is nothing compared to this.", "I don't reckon he can afford it. I think the emergency was planned so he could stop the honeymoon early and I don't think anything beyond those first few days was booked at all.", "At this point I want to know if she even googled him before marrying him. Poor woman.", "Many bigger counties will have online marriage searches. If you remember what county the license is from, you can likely do a search on their website to check the status of the marriage.  Google \"[name.vof county] [state] marriage license search\".", "Red flag hunny, RED FLAG! Get their numbers and call! I don\u2019t believe his story! I believe he\u2019s lying for other reasons! Also, since he wants to treat you this bad, divorce & get away from him!", "Reminds me of the guy who kept updating his wife about his pregnant niece. When the niece gave birth he had to be at the hospital. As it turns out, that was not his niece but the baby was definitely his.", "Going to respectfully disagree with you there, but I bet we\u2019re looking at it differently - I bet you\u2019re the age when most dating came from online. I\u2019m a boomer and was 23 when I married my 32 year old husband. Better part of 4 decades now, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s til death do us part\u2026\n\nAnyway, in the pre-internet days, and sometimes still today, people met at work, or socially, at church or in clubs. They weren\u2019t looking for romance, they were just going around living their lives, and sometimes they just happened to meet someone they \u201cclicked\u201d with. An age gap of 10 years or so wasn\u2019t, and isn\u2019t, considered anything problematic in a case like that! \n\nToday so many people use dating apps to meet, and in that case, yeah\u2026why are you deliberately looking for someone a different age than you are? You didn\u2019t just happen to randomly \u201cclick\u201d with that person, you haven\u2019t even met them yet! You know nothing about them!\n\nSo - before you judge something as a bit off, I suggest considering how they met. Sometimes it\u2019s perfectly fine and sometimes it\u2019s what you\u2019re describing.", "My husband and I met when we were 24 (me) and 33 (him). This summer, I'll be 33.\n\nI couldn't ask for a better husband. I specifically like that he has experienced more in life and can teach me things I don't know and how to do stuff, and that he is calm and stable.", "Oh it's about way more than the age gap in this case. This is about a 32yo American man who spent 6 months in Thailand to bag a 24yo wife that he when she asks about things he's doing he tells her she \"wouldn't understand \" or has no right to know most of the time. In the words of OP \"he's a very private man\". I might need to barf.", "Yup. Annnnd even though the niece is mostly ok, if she\u2019s his kid\u2026.", "Yep, at this point, *OP* is the side-piece...", "My grandfather was roughly 30 years older than my grandmother. (In fact he was a year older than my great grandmother) Gram was a divorcee with two children was in her late thirties and he was a widower in his sixties when they met. They were happily married for over 30 years. It can work, especially if those involved are older.", "Also feel the same way when reading some comments here that automatically assume that age gaps are bad at a certain age, but then become ok once you get a bit older. I\u2019ve been with my wife for 6 years now, I am 40 soon and she is 28. When we met I was looking to settle down and find my person, and so was she. My wife is very mature having traveled extensively, and it just worked. We\u2019ve always had a very strong relationship with great communication. We both work from home and therefore spend most days together with little time apart, and we wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. So to the people here putting numbers down on what\u2019s ok and what\u2019s not, just remember we\u2019re all on our own path, and what works for you maybe doesn\u2019t work for someone else, because we\u2019ve all come from different backgrounds and are living different lives. Find your person, accept them for who they are, and live a happy life together!", "It kinda reminded me a lot of White Lotus season 2. Very weird situation.", "I'm stressed \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "Six months?!? With the age gap, and his lack of communication? And his controlling behavior? I\u2019m beginning to question whether the accident is even real at this point or is he trying to gaslight OP to keep her under his thumb, or trying to get her to cut the honeymoon short for other reasons. I am seeing red flags galore at this point.", "Yeah, now I'm beginning to wonder if it's actually *his* wife and child in the hospital...", "This is some 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 shit."]}
