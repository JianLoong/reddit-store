The plan was to travel for two months for different countries of Europe, Asia and Africa. We currently are in Spain and we are supposed to take a plane to Morocco in two days. However my husband wants to cut the trip short and go back to our home now. \n\nThe thing is his brother is in a horrible situation, his wife and daughter had a car crash and they're on the hospital. The kid is fine but his wife has to be a little longer in the hospital, that's all I know. I told my husband that I understand he wants to support his brother but that he's not a doctor so he can't do anything to help really. And his brother's wife is fine, she probably only has a broken leg or something and that's why she needs some more days in the hospital. I told him to just call his brother and ask to talk with his wife so he can send her his best wishes and that's all that he can do honestly. His parents and his in laws are helping with the kids so there's really nothing they need help in. I told him our honeymoon was important because it's a time for ourselves to enjoy and spend together. \n\nHe wasn't having any of it, he called me selfish and then he kicked me out of our bedroom, I had to ask for a new one until he decided to let me in again. He told me that he's leaving tomorrow because he needs to be supportive of his brother and told me I can continue the trip by myself. But that's not the point of s honeymoon at all, I told him so and he said that if he would've known how bitchy I was he would've never dated me.

It\u2019s impossible to tell more from this post if you should or shouldn\u2019t go home.

I don't know if, at your age, you appreciate the exceptional position you are in, especially in contrast with a life endangering car accident.\n* Despite not being a doctor yourself and with little to no information, you are vastly minimizing the physical damage done to you in-laws.  *Conveniently* for you, this dis-information supports your entitled opinion to stay on your incredible honeymoon\n* You show ZERO sympathy or empathy to the situation.  Not a good look for a young spouse to show to their SO and their family.  It's the type of behavior that makes people sit down and reconsider their relationship with you.\n\nNow, here's why you've already lost the fight.  Your (STBX?) husband has:\n\n* told you face to face that you're wrong and selfish\n* kicked you, his new wife, out of the bedroom!!!  Out of the bedroom on the honeymoon, of all times!!!\n* is leaving to go home\n* told you face to face that he's reconsidering his relationship with you and not only has doubts, he has ***REGRETS***\n\nLet's finish with some more reality:\n\n* Your honeymoon is ***OVER*** and there's nothing you can do about it except to accept it\n* Your marriage is hanging by a thread and the only way you can save it at this point is to admit you have been acting incredibly entitled and selfish, profusely apologize and go back home with your husband.\n\nTo sum up - you've screwed up royally, your honeymoon is over and your marriage is very close to being over.  You need to grow up and learn some sympathy and empathy for others.\n\nYTA (of course).", "Well, I hope you enjoyed your three weeks of marriage. Family comes before a honeymoon.

I think you both are wrong because you couldn\u2019t simply talk, understand each other, and reach a conclusion. This is why a lot of relationships fail.

You admitted yourself you don\u2019t know the details, your the AH for assuming anything about how severe the situation is. If she\u2019s being kept longer than the child after a car crash, it\u2019s more severe than a broken leg. I\u2019d be upset with you because of how you dismiss family like that.

Also, it really seems like you would be on the other side of this, if it was you or your husband in the hospital; by which I mean, in that case, you would be offended and hold grudge against anyone that didn\u2019t deem your terrible accident bad enough to support you. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have kicked you out /locked you out of the hotel room.

You've already had a nice honeymoon, certainly nicer than most folks'. But you're only thinking of yourself. It doesn't matter if other family members are helping. That's his brother, SIL, and niece!

There are times when people need to be in the hospital for a few days but their injuries aren't that horrible (and by that I mean not life threatening, and no permanent damage), and if that's the situation, then I would understand not wanting to cut short your honeymoon.

You are right that in that even if he goes back there is nothing he could have really done to help. I don\u2019t know if the rest of your trip was refundable or not, so I\u2019m that part that would have been tons of wasted money.

I\u2019d think most people would discourage their loved ones from cutting a honeymoon short unless circumstances were pretty dire. \n\nIf the brother and parents are telling your husband that this is bad enough to cut the trip short, that speaks volumes.

These are people he loves and cares about and it doesn't matter how minor you think the accident is to him it is extremely important because this is his blood and his family. Of course he wants to go back there because these are people that mean a lot to him.

But it's *alarming* that you haven't bothered to figure out why she's in the hospital still and are just randomly guessing.  It is your responsibility to be proactive and push your husband for details on this, you can't just \"assume he'd tell you if it was serious,\" as you said a few times in the comments.  *Being in the hospital for multiple days is serious*.\n\nIf you've asked and he's not told you, that is a problem.

I really hope this is fake.", "Yes YTA because it sounds like you're dismissing the situation without knowing how serious the wife's condition is, and also dismissing the fact that your husband is clearly distraught and won't be able to enjoy himself without knowing more about the situation. Would YOU even be able to enjoy yourself on a honeymoon where your husband is worried sick and upset the whole time? that's just weird tbh.\n\nAlso emotional support isn't about fixing the problem, it's about being there for them.  When you're upset about things, doesn't it make you feel better to feel that people care? even if they can't do anything to fix your problems?\n\nAnd honestly, if your husband just went like \"meh, not much we can do, lets just continue enjoying ourselves\", he'd sound like a really shitty person and you should be wary of him.

The plan was to travel for two months for different countries of Europe, Asia and Africa. We currently are in Spain and we are supposed to take a plane to Morocco in two days. However my husband wants to cut the trip short and go back to our home now. \n\nThe thing is his brother is in a horrible situation, his wife and daughter had a car crash and they're on the hospital. The kid is fine but his wife has to be a little longer in the hospital, that's all I know. I told my husband that I understand he wants to support his brother but that he's not a doctor so he can't do anything to help really. And his brother's wife is fine, she probably only has a broken leg or something and that's why she needs some more days in the hospital. I told him to just call his brother and ask to talk with his wife so he can send her his best wishes and that's all that he can do honestly. His parents and his in laws are helping with the kids so there's really nothing they need help in. I told him our honeymoon was important because it's a time for ourselves to enjoy and spend together. \n\nHe wasn't having any of it, he called me selfish and then he kicked me out of our bedroom, I had to ask for a new one until he decided to let me in again. He told me that he's leaving tomorrow because he needs to be supportive of his brother and told me I can continue the trip by myself. But that's not the point of s honeymoon at all, I told him so and he said that if he would've known how bitchy I was he would've never dated me.

Hopefully you never need any.", "NTA \n\nBut you may need to understand that your husband isn't able to be logical right now. He's stuck in being emotional. \n\nIt happens to everyone.", "YTA. I bet your marriage is over now.", "YTA 100% \n\nYes, you are really wrong here. \n\nThe fact that you can't see how selfish you re being is actually sad. You don't have to be a doctor to support a family member in the hospital. Just being there is enough. Your BIL is going through an extremely difficult time and you think that your honeymoon is more important?? Vacations can be postponed. Yeah, you may lose some money leaving your tip early, but your being there for family in a time of need like this is more important. \n\nI bet you if it was your sibling going through this that you would be on the earliest flight back.", "NAH\n\nBut you now learnt that you are the more pragmatic one in the relationship, your husband is probably more controled by his emotions. \n\nOr in an example, if you guys are in a plane crash he would maybe help others with their oxygen mask while you will first put on your own before helping others bc you know you can save much more lifes this way. \n\nThere is no right or wrong here. Since he is more emotional you will not be able to convince him with logic and vice versa. \n\nI would recommend couples counceling as soon you are back, bc you will resent him for the lost honeymoon and he resents you for not blindly following his emotional decisions. This will end bad if you aren't willing to see eachothers pov and how to handle this difference in your personalities.", "YTA.

It\u2019s not a tragedy requiring a period of mourning, which would interfere with the joyful aspect of a honeymoon. The brother may need support, but that is logistical assistance which is better provided by those close at hand.

The BIL wasn't involved, so he can help care for his wife. His kid is also apparently (mostly) unhurt and sounds like overall the injuries are minor to the wife. Plus BIL has other family support. So I get you, what is your husband really going to be able to do?\n\nAll the same though, if your husband isn't going to be able to enjoy his vacation because of this, you don't have much option here. He's going to resent you and make the vacation un-fun if you happened to arm twist him into staying. But then because you see these things at differing levels of severity, he breaks out insults and even kicks you out of the room? Even says he wouldn't have dated you.... Dude went way too far. And honestly, I have some concerns about his emotional stability if he can't hear news that family members are mildly hurt and not become verbally abusive towards you when it comes to how to respond to such injuries. Like, what happens when say his father becomes terminally ill? This is pretty big red flag that you have some serious troubles ahead of you.\n\nSo, this a bit of unbalanced-ESH, him way more than you, but also you. Even if he wasn't such a raging AH about this, you should probably defer to his judgement her given you require him to be a good state of mind to enjoy a vacation and it is his family.

What is he going to do for his brother other than be there? Do they not have other family? She\u2019s probably making comments based on little info the husband is giving.

And he kicked you out of your hotel room??? Girl no.", "NTA", "Nta", "ESH but I think you're more of the AH. You don't know what the SIL condition might be.

You're not typically in a hospital room for just a broken leg...usually that's cast and discharge ASAP so they can have the room back to cater to another patient.  \n\n\nHe's also wrong to have kicked you out of the room. But totally fair to leave your on your honeymoon plans to see family who have been injured.  \n\n\nIDK while I get the disappointment of shortening the honeymoon - I'd also be concerned if my partner was consistently worried or upset the entire remaining of the trip due to an incident back home.

I\u2019m 0% shocked that OP lacks the maturity, sensitivity and emotional intelligence to understand that her husband wants to come home bc she\u2019s too focused on wanting to have her own fun. Unfortunately loads of ppl in their early 20s are very self centered - that typically improves with age.
