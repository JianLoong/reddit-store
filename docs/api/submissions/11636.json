The plan was to travel for two months for different countries of Europe, Asia and Africa. We currently are in Spain and we are supposed to take a plane to Morocco in two days. However my husband wants to cut the trip short and go back to our home now. \n\nThe thing is his brother is in a horrible situation, his wife and daughter had a car crash and they're on the hospital. The kid is fine but his wife has to be a little longer in the hospital, that's all I know. I told my husband that I understand he wants to support his brother but that he's not a doctor so he can't do anything to help really. And his brother's wife is fine, she probably only has a broken leg or something and that's why she needs some more days in the hospital. I told him to just call his brother and ask to talk with his wife so he can send her his best wishes and that's all that he can do honestly. His parents and his in laws are helping with the kids so there's really nothing they need help in. I told him our honeymoon was important because it's a time for ourselves to enjoy and spend together. \n\nHe wasn't having any of it, he called me selfish and then he kicked me out of our bedroom, I had to ask for a new one until he decided to let me in again. He told me that he's leaving tomorrow because he needs to be supportive of his brother and told me I can continue the trip by myself. But that's not the point of s honeymoon at all, I told him so and he said that if he would've known how bitchy I was he would've never dated me.

It\u2019s impossible to tell more from this post if you should or shouldn\u2019t go home.

I don't know if, at your age, you appreciate the exceptional position you are in, especially in contrast with a life endangering car accident.\n* Despite not being a doctor yourself and with little to no information, you are vastly minimizing the physical damage done to you in-laws.  *Conveniently* for you, this dis-information supports your entitled opinion to stay on your incredible honeymoon\n* You show ZERO sympathy or empathy to the situation.  Not a good look for a young spouse to show to their SO and their family.  It's the type of behavior that makes people sit down and reconsider their relationship with you.\n\nNow, here's why you've already lost the fight.  Your (STBX?) husband has:\n\n* told you face to face that you're wrong and selfish\n* kicked you, his new wife, out of the bedroom!!!  Out of the bedroom on the honeymoon, of all times!!!\n* is leaving to go home\n* told you face to face that he's reconsidering his relationship with you and not only has doubts, he has ***REGRETS***\n\nLet's finish with some more reality:\n\n* Your honeymoon is ***OVER*** and there's nothing you can do about it except to accept it\n* Your marriage is hanging by a thread and the only way you can save it at this point is to admit you have been acting incredibly entitled and selfish, profusely apologize and go back home with your husband.\n\nTo sum up - you've screwed up royally, your honeymoon is over and your marriage is very close to being over.  You need to grow up and learn some sympathy and empathy for others.\n\nYTA (of course).", "Well, I hope you enjoyed your three weeks of marriage. Family comes before a honeymoon.

I think you both are wrong because you couldn\u2019t simply talk, understand each other, and reach a conclusion. This is why a lot of relationships fail.

You clearly don't give a shit about your husband's family - YOUR family - and while he was wrong in his reaction, you're not right either.\n\nI also don't understand what the point in continuing a trip is if one of the people is miserable, worried, and with their mind elsewhere. He doesn't want to be there, period, and that's that.

No one gets admitted to the hospital and kept longer over a broken bone. People are in and out the same day for a broken leg. You admitted yourself you don\u2019t know the details, your the AH for assuming anything about how severe the situation is. If she\u2019s being kept longer than the child after a car crash, it\u2019s more severe than a broken leg. I\u2019d be upset with you because of how you dismiss family like that.

Also, it really seems like you would be on the other side of this, if it was you or your husband in the hospital; by which I mean, in that case, you would be offended and hold grudge against anyone that didn\u2019t deem your terrible accident bad enough to support you. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have kicked you out /locked you out of the hotel room.

There are times when people need to be in the hospital for a few days but their injuries aren't that horrible (and by that I mean not life threatening, and no permanent damage), and if that's the situation, then I would understand not wanting to cut short your honeymoon.

You are right that in that even if he goes back there is nothing he could have really done to help. I don\u2019t know if the rest of your trip was refundable or not, so I\u2019m that part that would have been tons of wasted money.

I\u2019d think most people would discourage their loved ones from cutting a honeymoon short unless circumstances were pretty dire. \n\nIf the brother and parents are telling your husband that this is bad enough to cut the trip short, that speaks volumes.

These are people he loves and cares about and it doesn't matter how minor you think the accident is to him it is extremely important because this is his blood and his family. Of course he wants to go back there because these are people that mean a lot to him.

But it's *alarming* that you haven't bothered to figure out why she's in the hospital still and are just randomly guessing.  It is your responsibility to be proactive and push your husband for details on this, you can't just \"assume he'd tell you if it was serious,\" as you said a few times in the comments.  *Being in the hospital for multiple days is serious*.\n\nIf you've asked and he's not told you, that is a problem.  If he wants to cut your honeymoon short, you do need to know the situation if you ask.\n\nI feel like the age gap here is playing some sort of role, but it's difficult to really say without more information.

Would YOU even be able to enjoy yourself on a honeymoon where your husband is worried sick and upset the whole time? that's just weird tbh.\n\nAlso emotional support isn't about fixing the problem, it's about being there for them.  When you're upset about things, doesn't it make you feel better to feel that people care? even if they can't do anything to fix your problems?\n\nAnd honestly, if your husband just went like \"meh, not much we can do, lets just continue enjoying ourselves\", he'd sound like a really shitty person and you should be wary of him. He'll likely act the same way when you're in trouble or anyone else you care about is in trouble.", "NTA and i cant believe all the YTA\u2019s.Its not wrong for the husband to want to come home obviously, wanting to be there for your brother and extended family etc is totally justifiable, except when you probably have thousands spent on a honeymoon with your new wife and your brother and extended family have all the help and care they need at home. if they didn\u2019t have help at home, then yes the husband is correct and they should leave right away but that wasn\u2019t the case. i feel bad for the wife, thats a lot of money down the drain.", "YTA.\n\nIf both of you decided you want to go on the trip despite the circumstances, that would be a different story.

The plan was to travel for two months for different countries of Europe, Asia and Africa. We currently are in Spain and we are supposed to take a plane to Morocco in two days. However my husband wants to cut the trip short and go back to our home now. \n\nThe thing is his brother is in a horrible situation, his wife and daughter had a car crash and they're on the hospital. The kid is fine but his wife has to be a little longer in the hospital, that's all I know. I told my husband that I understand he wants to support his brother but that he's not a doctor so he can't do anything to help really. And his brother's wife is fine, she probably only has a broken leg or something and that's why she needs some more days in the hospital. I told him to just call his brother and ask to talk with his wife so he can send her his best wishes and that's all that he can do honestly. His parents and his in laws are helping with the kids so there's really nothing they need help in. I told him our honeymoon was important because it's a time for ourselves to enjoy and spend together. \n\nHe wasn't having any of it, he called me selfish and then he kicked me out of our bedroom, I had to ask for a new one until he decided to let me in again. He told me that he's leaving tomorrow because he needs to be supportive of his brother and told me I can continue the trip by myself. But that's not the point of s honeymoon at all, I told him so and he said that if he would've known how bitchy I was he would've never dated me.

I'll take it as writ you've never had a broken leg or a horrific accident.

Hopefully you never need any.", "NTA \n\nBut you may need to understand that your husband isn't able to be logical right now. He's stuck in being emotional. \n\nIt happens to everyone.", "YTA. I bet your marriage is over now.", "YTA 100% \n\nYes, you are really wrong here. \n\nThe fact that you can't see how selfish you re being is actually sad. You don't have to be a doctor to support a family member in the hospital. Just being there is enough. Your BIL is going through an extremely difficult time and you think that your honeymoon is more important?? Vacations can be postponed. Yeah, you may lose some money leaving your tip early, but your being there for family in a time of need like this is more important. \n\nI bet you if it was your sibling going through this that you would be on the earliest flight back.", "NAH\n\nBut you now learnt that you are the more pragmatic one in the relationship, your husband is probably more controled by his emotions. \n\nOr in an example, if you guys are in a plane crash he would maybe help others with their oxygen mask while you will first put on your own before helping others bc you know you can save much more lifes this way. \n\nThere is no right or wrong here. Since he is more emotional you will not be able to convince him with logic and vice versa. \n\nI would recommend couples counceling as soon you are back, bc you will resent him for the lost honeymoon and he resents you for not blindly following his emotional decisions. This will end bad if you aren't willing to see eachothers pov and how to handle this difference in your personalities.", "YTA.

It\u2019s not a tragedy requiring a period of mourning, which would interfere with the joyful aspect of a honeymoon. The brother may need support, but that is logistical assistance which is better provided by those close at hand.

You lack empathy.", "ESH you should have said that you guys should stay calm and in communication and make sure everything is okay before just assuming they'd be fine or assuming that you'd need to fly home immediately.

The BIL wasn't involved, so he can help care for his wife. His kid is also apparently (mostly) unhurt and sounds like overall the injuries are minor to the wife. Plus BIL has other family support. So I get you, what is your husband really going to be able to do?\n\nAll the same though, if your husband isn't going to be able to enjoy his vacation because of this, you don't have much option here. He's going to resent you and make the vacation un-fun if you happened to arm twist him into staying. But then because you see these things at differing levels of severity, he breaks out insults and even kicks you out of the room? Even says he wouldn't have dated you.... Dude went way too far. And honestly, I have some concerns about his emotional stability if he can't hear news that family members are mildly hurt and not become verbally abusive towards you when it comes to how to respond to such injuries. Like, what happens when say his father becomes terminally ill? This is pretty big red flag that you have some serious troubles ahead of you.\n\nSo, this a bit of unbalanced-ESH, him way more than you, but also you. Even if he wasn't such a raging AH about this, you should probably defer to his judgement her given you require him to be a good state of mind to enjoy a vacation and it is his family.

What is he going to do for his brother other than be there? Do they not have other family? She\u2019s probably making comments based on little info the husband is giving.

And he kicked you out of your hotel room??? Girl no.", "NTA", "Nta", "ESH but I think you're more of the AH. You don't know what the SIL condition might be.

You're not typically in a hospital room for just a broken leg...usually that's cast and discharge ASAP so they can have the room back to cater to another patient.  \n\n\nHe's also wrong to have kicked you out of the room. But totally fair to leave your on your honeymoon plans to see family who have been injured.  \n\n\nIDK while I get the disappointment of shortening the honeymoon - I'd also be concerned if my partner was consistently worried or upset the entire remaining of the trip due to an incident back home.

So many red flags and with the age difference I\u2019m getting major abuser vibes.", "It's understandable that there are people who would prioritize family being hospitalized over a vacation.", "That's so untrue. \n\nMaking someone your priority doesn't mean that this person will ALWAYS come first, just that in similar situations, this person will come first. As in, if you are walking in the street with your wife and brother, and a car suddenly swerve toward your wife and brother and you can only save one,  you would save your wife. That doesn't mean that if the same car was running toward only your brother, you would not save him just because you were too busy holding your wife's hand.\n\nIn that case... OP is a human being too. He has the right to put HIMSELF first, in front of his wife. If the situation is worrying him too much and he wants to be there to support his brother, he won't have any fun during his honeymoon, and I don't see how it's justify that he disregards his own feeling just to please his wife. He has the right to do what he wants, too. He is not a slave.", "That's such a wild concept. I personally don't want to be married to someone whose values mean that only one person in their life can be a priority and their family suddenly falls down the ladder just because we signed papers, but maybe that's just me.", "Cutting a trip short due to an accident that caused two family members to be hospitalized is a completely normal and reasonable response. **As his wife, why would you event want to continue a vacation knowing your SO is worried sick?** Just take another damn vacation at a later date.", "Why is it selfish to take a trip if you can afford it? That\u2019s nobody\u2019s business", "Travelling is an AH behavior? Just say you can't afford it and don't shit on others who can.", "Why?", "Actually I have seen people hospitalized over this, especially depending on where you are and how quickly you can get into surgery. Regardless, without a full accounting of the injuries I don\u2019t think we\u2019re qualified to judge. They both sound immature as hell so it could go either way.", "Yeah this may also be an Americans perspective but if you can take a two month honeymoon seems like you have the money and ability to make this trip up later. But that's not specifically relevant. They are currently on the trip and OP wants two continue. But if husband isn't going to enjoy himself there's no point to staying even if OP is \"right\".\n\nOP says all they know is about the broken leg. But a broken leg potentially means SIL can't drive and can't walk (or get around easily) so maybe the family needs help because of that. There's missing information here. Even with that information it may just be different priorities.", "People who have to be in the hospital for a while typically aren\u2019t totally fine.

Not even in European countries with zero costs for medical treatment.\nThere is something off with the narrative.", "YTA If this is in the USA you better believe they wouldn't keep her in the hospital if it isn't serious. US hospitals bounce people asap. You don't know what's going on. You could have been more reasonable and sympathetic and asked your husband to reach out and get more details on the situation before making a decision together, but instead you dismissed his feelings and acted like a spoiled brat, which I'm sure has underscored your age difference to him. Your new marriage is in serious trouble. You and your husband need to have a serious talk. Communicate that you do care about what his family has suffered (even though it appears you don't) but that you are disappointed to lose this special time with him. Respect his feelings and concern for his loved ones. You can always return to the trip if everything is fine or schedule another trip for later, when things have calmed down and you will BOTH be able to enjoy it.", "People don't have to stay in the hospital for a while for \"probably a broken leg\".

You don't have the number of his parents either?", "You don't have any of his family's numbers at all?\n\nI'm still sticking with the YTA opinion because that would be my answer to the specific question you asked but something's terribly wrong in your marriage already if your husband won't even tell you exactly what is happening.\n\nI think that there are LOTS of 'missing reasons' here.", "not really, since it sounds like she has no idea what is going on", "I worded my question badly.

I would not be in the least able to enjoy my vacation, and I would expect my wife to understand that.", "The injury is almost irrelevant. At this point, an automobile accident put two family members in a hospital. If OP's SO is worried enough to cut their TWO MONTH vacation short a couple weeks, then that seems completely reasonable.", "In that case it\u2019s not \u201conly a broken leg\u201d, my point is that OP clearly has no actual idea what\u2019s going on and shouldn\u2019t be speaking about her sister in laws situation is such a dismissive way.", "Honestly, if my SO told me she doesn't care about my feeling and my family and want me to stay on a vacation because SHE WANTED TO CONTINUE HAVING FUN WHILE I AM CLEARLY UPSET AND WORRIED, yeah, I would be pissed.\n\nThe husband is not a toy she can play with, he has his own feelings, and if he doesn't feel like being on a vacation anymore because he is too worried, he should be allowed to go. He is not OP's slave.", "Yeah fuck that guy for caring about his family and wanting to be there for them.", "And she's no better. He's worried about his family and she's being dismissive. She's just upset that her two-month vacation could be interrupted.

I did not defend OP's actions at all. \n\nI did not say he was shitty for being angry or horrified, I said he should not have acted the way he did.

Given your overall attitude, he probably decided that you weren't worth communicating with.", "Your husband told you that his family member is seriously injured enough that she is still in the hospital after several days. That means it's NOT \"probably just a broken leg\", unless it's so badly broken that it requires serious invasive surgery and extensive rehabilitation. For all you know it could be a head injury. Everything he has told you indicates a serious injury. You're just so self-absorbed that you can't conceive of it unless it's spelled out for you in crayon.", "You don't know that. At all. It's not like you guys are gone for a week or two. You're gone for TWO MONTHS and have already been gone for 3 weeks.", "Yeah because you really seem like the kinda person he could communicate with when he needs support.", "Regarding reading comprehension, you will note that I already noted I missed the \"probably\" in my response to an earlier response to me. \n\nI still think that OP is NTA until they know that the SIL's condition is something they should return home for. As far as we know, it may well not be that serious. I would not want to fly across an ocean for something that turned out to be totally unnecessary.

Often there\u2019s a stabilization procedure and then they don\u2019t even do the repair for several more days while the swelling goes down.

Which is on a whole different level these days.", "THERE IS NO BROKEN LEG. She literally invented the idea that the sister \"probably has a broken leg\". Go back and read it again. What she actually knows about the sister is nothing to do with a broken leg, but rather that she is injured seriously enough to have to stay in the hospital for longer than her child. She does not know ANY SPECIFICS about her sister-in-law's injuries. It could in fact be a head injury or something else very serious.", "Yeah it sounds much more like SIL is fine as in *alive* and not fine as in in fine health.

I personally don't think it's a smart decision but she's made the choice to do so.", "Is your father high risk?
