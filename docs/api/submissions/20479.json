I'm surprised he managed to break that in the first place which to me screams that he is doing this on purpose, which is why I'm extra upset. \nIt was about 5 feet tall, laminated plate glass. He broke it by 'accidentally' hitting the table while he was running, and the table swung, making the statue fall.

I was an administrator, so these kids ended up with me when they needed to be separated from the group.  One summer, a little boy (6) who had huge anger problems (destroying property, hitting, biting, etc. - later learned he'd been sexually assaulted by his grandfather a few months before) came to our program.  He'd been kicked out of 2 other programs.  I taught him a few ASL signs and the \"fist to 5\" way of communicating his feelings without words, I found out what activities he liked best and focused on creating strategies so he could participate.  I made my office a safe place where he could come at any time he was overwhelmed, I created a drawer full of toys that helped kids calm down by asking his advice and ordering what he suggested, got him some math puzzles and workbooks because he said it helped him and he liked them, etc.  I also set it up with the teachers so that he could come to the office whenever he needed a break. Our program was based on the idea that all rules (for adults as well as kids)  come from one or more of these principles:  keeping bodies safe, feelings safe, and stuff/things safe.  We'd have discussions about why he was sent from the group based on these principles.  With this framework, he was able to understand/work out for himself the often confusing and contradictory messages that adults were giving him.  In 25 years of my career in education, he was my biggest success because he learned strategies to manage his big feelings and get lots of positive attention when he did.  He was completely out of control when he first came.  Between us, his parents, councilor, and his own will, he triumphed.  He came back the next summer, and I hardly saw him because he was out having fun.  \n\nTL/DR: Help children learn ways to control themselves.  This empowers them to make positive choices.
