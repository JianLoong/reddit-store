My 2 daughters asked me if I could help them with an apartment where they can live together by themselves and become more independent. Over the past few years they have always been exemplary.

There are plenty of ways to build character and face adversity, but I\u2019m sorry, chucking your money into the dead pit that is vastly overwhelming and overpriced rents doesn\u2019t really \u201cbuild character\u201d to the same degree it just subjects your children to hardships.\n\nI\u2019m assuming you will at some point (or from the word go) eventually expect your daughters to \u201cpay their way\u201d to some degree so what\u2019s the issue?", "NTA! Your ex sounds envious of the relationship you have with your daughters. There's absolutely nothing wrong with giving your kids a leg up in life.\n\nIf they're maintaining their grades, are helpful & respectful, there is, literally, no issue with assisting them with their college living arrangements. \n\nYou're able to provide for them in way that is great. I would think your ex would be happy that the kids have an active & helpful father in their lives. Sigh. \n\nYour ex does what she can and you do the same. There's nothing wrong with this. NTA at all.", "NTA, your wife should be happy that her children have such great opportunities. She's their mom and always will be, the only thing that will push them away from her is her getting frustrated with them for taking stuff from you. I hope they don't know about that", "NTA specifically in regards to the apartment request. \n\nIt's not super unusual for college age kids to rent a place to get a sense of living independently, and its not always uncommon for parents to assist with the rent. You just so happen to own a unit that you can provide them with. I don't necessarily see this as spoiling them.\n\nBut I suspect there might be some missing information if your ex-wife is citing this as a continuing pattern with you. What other things has she taken issue with?", "NTA - As long as your motives are pure, and it sounds like they are, you are NTA for wanting your daughters to have an easier start to life. Articulate to them clearly, and maybe through an email that you can cc your ex-wife on, that you are helping them because of their excellent behavior, help to the family, and respectfulness.  Be clear with everyone WHY it is that you choose to help.  There is something to building character through not making things too easy for our children.  However, it seems like they are already taking on the responsibilities that you are hoping they learn.  \n\nYou cannot control your ex-wife's perception.  All you can do is communicate clearly and do what you feel is best for your daughters.", "NTA. Your daughters are adults, so she doesn't have a say on how you \"parent\" them anymore.", "NTA. Your ex is just envious, and she is going to ruin her own relationship with her daughters if she keeps carrying this resentment.", "Nothing wrong with spoiling your children as long as you stop before they're rotten, until then it's just nurturing. The same process that ripens fruit is the same process that eventually rots them, it's all about having the right conditions and moderation to keep them at the right stage. Your daughters are not rotting, they're blossoming. That's a good thing and your ex needs to butt out. She's right, they're adults, so there is no reason to co-parent and no reason for her to push her opinions on you. \n\nBut also... Supporting your children through college is in absolutely no way \"spoiling\" them. You spoil them with things they want, not by providing things they need like food, shelter, and education. Not everybody can *afford* to support their kids through college, but those who can absolutely *should*. You brought them into this world and setting them up to succeed, as best as you are able, is your responsibility. The fact she can't do the same for them is disheartening, I'm sure, but it's selfish of her to put her own feelings above her daughters' futures. NTA. Please continue to give them the opportunity to finish their education before they have to deal with the atrocious cost of living and harshness of our corporate society. Businesses don't care about your adult kids, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your daughters are reasonably well-adjusted. Could some adversity benefit their character? Sure. But, supporting your kids through college is not terrible as long as you're willing to take it away if they fail to meet their end of the agreement. If you aren't and they do, then you'd be spoiling them.", "NTA.  There is no spoiling involved.  You have good rules (keep grades up and no alchol).  Ignore your ex. You're an adult as are your 2 daughters.", "NTA, if your daughters behave well and are able to take care of themselves even without your help helping them is no problem. Just be mindful that it won't hinder their ability to act like adults in the future- make sure they work.", "NTA  \nYour ex should worry less about your relationship with your daughters and more on building hers. It's about a lot more than money.", "NTA -- and I think your ex has issues.  Maybe jealous as other poster said.  My ex has more money than I do, and I am thrilled that he helps our daughter out more than legally required.  Sure I wish I could, but my not funding her has never resulted in her not spending time with me, etc.  She divides holidays fairly.", "NTA\n\nMost parents help their college aged kids with housing costs. If you weren't doing it, she would have to. Your daughters are adults and are no doubt aware of your different incomes, so it's not about spoiling, just that you have a different income so it makes sense that you would pay for this, and if I were mom, I would be grateful that they have secure housing paid for and I didn't have to contribute a dime! One less thing to worry about!", "NTA.  Sounds like you have a great relationship with 2 great daughters.  Sounds like you have also replaced a bitter ex-wife with a new wife that suits you better and gets along with your daughters.  Good for you.  Let your ex wife be annoyed - it truly is not your problem.", "Do your daughters go to college locally? Does the oldest currently live at home then? \n\nI\u2019m assuming so otherwise I don\u2019t know why this is an issue - they have to live somewhere. Dorms cost money, apartments cost money. \n\nNTA - college is a great time for young adults to live on their own and start experiencing independence and the responsibilities that go with that.  Having each other and having you nearby is a great safety net. \n\nIf you have the means to afford this it\u2019s a great option for your daughters. Being independent also helps them transition to college life in making friends, etc.  \n\nHopefully it will be a positive experience and your ex will come around to seeing that perspective. If you do live locally to the college do your daughters still split time between your household and your ex\u2019s? Maybe she\u2019s just dreading the empty nest this will create and projecting that as you spoiling them.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get parents who don\u2019t want their kids to have an easier start in life. If your daughters don\u2019t pay for housing, they don\u2019t need to over work themselves, and thus can focus more in school or use the money now to start paying off debt. Your ex wife is completely out of reality.", "NTA but you say your daughter help her mother with her 2 toddlers maybe she doesn't want daughter to move in apartment because she wants her help at home.", "ESH.

I am sure that I would have done better in life if I had been provided with something like that while studying. I am sure my parents would have provided me with an appartment, if they had been able to afford it. It is only common sense that you can spend more time on studying and meaningful extra curriculars, if you don't have to earn your living by waiting tables, working in retail or something similar.
