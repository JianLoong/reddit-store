She honestly can't expect you not to use your yard.  Especially if you're not engaging the kids at all.", "NTA. What is that? \"Stop enjoying non disturbing ways your own home because your sole existence in eyesight of my kids makes them uncomfortable?\"\n\nNo, if their kids are disturbed by seeing other people the family needs to solve it by themselves - building high fence or move to house far from any neighbours.", "NTA. Her kids are so sensitive that they can\u2019t look at another human being? That\u2019s ridiculous. It sounds like their mother is using their autism as a crutch and an excuse. If they truly are that uncomfortable around one human, they need to relocate to somewhere in the country. She\u2019s being unreasonable.

It's your property. No one can tell you what to do in your own backyard, unless you're exposing yourself or something crazy like that.

That's a ridiculous ask and you should feel free to ignore it.", "NTA\n\nYou can do what you want on your own property. You're not doing anything inappropriate.

Seriously.", "It rubs me the wrong way when parents of neurodivergent kids always wants the world to stop and alter for their kids even when it's you just minding your business at home. I have a similar problem with autistic kids in my apartment complex. The mom won't tell her kids to stop screaming or bothering my cat because they're \"special\". Ma'am I have ADHD too and I literally buy extra devices to manage the stress your kids inflict on me and others. I just let it go. Put on ear plugs and when my cat is on the screened in patio, I watch to make sure they don't throw shit at my cat. \n\nThat mom is out of her fucking mind telling you that YOU know better because HER kids are extremely shy. Like she needs to get over herself. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You could compromise or let her know your schedule.

It's not like you're even bothering them", "INFO explain to me your friend\u2019s rationale that you\u2019re an AH for spending time in your yard.", "NTA\n\nRegardless of their disabilities, the kids need to learn to live within the world around them.  For instance, their mother could have asked to bring her kids to you to introduce you so they would feel more comfortable being outside when you were also outside.", "NTA, you are in your own yard, not doing anything illegal, nor questionable. Plus you are keeping quiet. If they want to have no people around - they need to find a bigger property or get higher fences.", "NTA - tell her she is free to plant higher hedges/built a higher fence to shield her kids.", "so she want you to stay inside so her children can be outside? heck no. it's insane she even asked something like that. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI worked with children for 25 years, including children with all sorts of problems. \n\nOne child was a refugee who\u2019d seen his sibling murdered by uniformed paramilitaries, and he hid under the table in distress the first time we had a visit from the police to talk about road crossing safety.\n\nExtreme distress requires careful handling and gradual exposure with lots of reassurance to the person who triggers the distress. If that\u2019s the sort of distress you\u2019re causing, then it will be less trouble in the long run to have a slow and gradual period of introduction/adaptation. \n\nThe mum might well be over-protective, but it\u2019s not in the children\u2019s long term interest to avoid the issue, rather than working out a coping strategy. She really needs to bring her children\u2019s therapist on board. If they\u2019re diagnosed autistic by a professional, they will have one.\n\nWould you be up for a discussion with her about it. At least you\u2019ll find out if she\u2019s an entitled person.\n\nDon\u2019t expect the problem to be quickly solved, if you decide to listen to their therapist, but it\u2019s by no means impossible for you all to get in with everything you both want to do in your outside space", "Hi OP,\n\nNTA for not wanting to change your lifestyle but the way you worded things sounds a bit dickish. \n\nParents can be overly enabling and protective of their kids to begin with so if you add dissabilities on top of that it makes sense why they would feel the urge to adapt the environment to suit their children's preferences. \n\nI've worked in mental health for about a decade including with children/teens on the spectrum. Your activities do not sound disruptive at all and it's on the family to work on making the kids feel more comfortable being outside while you are outside too. Typically once they get used you being out and not bothering them at all their discomfort will lessen or dissappear. \n\nMaybe talking to the kids would help like going over once in a while to become more familiar to them and reassure them you aren't watching and judging them when they play outside.\n\ngood luck with your studies!", "NTA. That\u2019s an outrageous and entitled ask that isn\u2019t even going to help her children grow into as functional of adults as they could be. Autism does not mean the entire world has to cater to your difficulties and encouraging kids to step outside their comfort zones in reasonable and safe ways helps them grow.", "NTA, you are in your own garden minding your own business enjoying your own home and property.", "NTA.  The world cannot revolve around her kids and she has to start teaching them that. If she has to, she can put up some sort of barrier so they don't see into your garden.", "She can introduce you to the kids to improve their comfort.  She can pay to have a wall put up so they can't see you. She can take her kids somewhere else to play. She can wait until you go in to let her kids out.  \n\nShe's the parent, it's her responsibility. It's not reasonable to tell someone else not to use their own space.", "It\u2019s not like OP is doing anything excessively loud, the loudest thing is probably running a leaf blower or something.", "this is such an unreasonable ask i have to disagree. at that point even asking is rude, it doesn\u2019t matter what your tone or phrasing is. nta.", "His parents probably planned ahead i.e built his credit early then cosigned", "Not that uncommon. I did the same in the northeast before the market went wacky", "Oh there's certainly an AH here. It's just not Op", "Or move to a more remote property where they are far less likely to get neighbours.", "If she\u2019s going to try snowplow their triggers out of their way she\u2019s going to end up with adults dependent on her and with few socials skills because she\u2019s using the coping mechanism of avoiding the issue.", "OP is a she", "My bad but still"]}
