This was really good quality stuff, too, and it was still in excellent shape, not too old or outdated or anything. But she turned me down--thanks, but they had chosen an all-pink, bunny themed (I think?) nursery and my stuff wouldn't go with it, plus she and her daughter wanted to be able to pick out what they wanted. They registered at the most expensive baby boutique in town--I would occasionally buy special occasion outfits there for my kids but that was about it. I guess she thought that because most of her coworkers were high earners (besides her, she was a receptionist) that we would splurge on her new granddaughter. But most of us are still pretty careful with money and we just because we have a good income doesn't mean we're going to blow it on overpriced boutique baby gear. \n\nIf she'd just asked for basics, or even diapers and formula, I think people would have been pretty generous, but this registry offended a lot of people. She also wanted the shower to be potluck, and she wanted one of our other coworkers who had the largest home with a huge patio to host it there. Basically she wanted to spend nothing on this shower but get a ton of stuff out of it, for the baby of a girl none of us had ever met.\n\nThe plans ended up falling through.

Your cousin is in for a very rude awakening if she thinks you were being mean.\n\nAnyone taking bets on how long the uncle holds to his, \"You have to get a job\" stance before he caves and pays for everything?", "NTA \n\nHowever I\u2019d tell your uncle he has no place getting on your ass for trying to help her, that she refused to accept reality isn\u2019t an issue for you to fix. It also isn\u2019t your responsibility to come up where he\u2019s falling shot financially and give her money. That if he\u2019s so worried about her stress he should be bankrolling the basic necessities like crib/clothes and then have her cover the formula and diapers etc moving forward. I wouldn\u2019t apologize to your cousin either, you said and did nothing wrong. She\u2019s looking to be coddled and saved from her own decisions and is pissed she\u2019s not getting that from anyone.", "Kinda YTA because an old crib might not be up to today's safety standards, and yes, since she is heavily pregnant it's true no one hires if they know that, and yeah, your hormones do get pretty messed up which can affect your mood.  So, like, I think to stop looking for her is fair if she doesn't like the types of things you find, but telling her to get off her ass and find a job really isn't because that's just not possible when the baby's coming in three freaking weeks.  Realistically her parents will probably cave and help her and she knows it.", "Sounds like cousin wanted a free handout of brand new designer baby stuff. Too bad she did get it. You are NOT responsible for her or her baby. She can find a job, she doesn't want one.

You are correct that she can't be choosy, but she will have to learn that herself.  You didn't need to be cruel about her situation - it sounds like you took joy in rubbing her face in it.\n\nHow about this:  Get out of her business and let her handle it.  \"Help\" like yours is not needed by anyone. Yes, we know she's going to suffer, but you don't have to assist in trying to shame her.", "It's never too late for adoption.", "NTA. Aunt & Uncle are WAY too late trying to teach their daughter responsibility; that shit should've been instilled as early as age 10 (it's the age I was when my mom asked me to scoop cat pans for the first time, but I've always cleaned up after myself). They spoiled her rotten, & suddenly they can't anymore because she was stupid enough to get knocked up (give me flak all you want, I stand my ground, because people like her are incapable of being proper parents, as is evident by her refusal to accept secondhand clothes & a crib). Block them, because you were absolutely right. She can accept the generous offer you found or she can tighten up her big girl pants & get a job (same with the father).", "You told her the truth and as they say, the truth hurts.. you helped and she threw it back in your face\u2026", "NTA about the clothes and her general attitude, but be careful with old cribs. They update the safety standards every so often. If the crib is older than the current standards, it could be dangerous or even deadly.

I\u2019m so glad to hear that the uncle has volunteered to buy all this stuff to reduce her stress during these trying times.\n\nOh, does he not want to do that?  Maybe a reality check is in fact needed in this situation.", "I don\u2019t blame her. There\u2019s plenty of organizations out there that give vouchers and brand new items. Maybe help her get in touch with these places? I mean, she is thinking of her child. I hope you\u2019re not enjoying her plight.", "NTA, you are right. \n\nYour cousin gives the impression of being an obnoxious spoilt brat willing to resort to emotional blackmail and deceitful tactics to get her own way.", ">My uncle later called me and told me that I had greatly upset my cousin\n\nOkay, so he wont support them but will criticize any family member who the cousin says isnt supporting them enough.\n\nWhat a hypocrite, NTA.", "NTA for trying to help but I wouldn\u2019t recommend using an old, secondhand crib just for the sake of safety. You don\u2019t know whether that crib meets current safety standards, or whether it\u2019s been misused. Cribs have weight limits, and if people piled old junk in a crib it could easily have gone over the weight limit, making it unsafe for future baby use.

I'm better off quiet. Good luck with your baby! Can't wait to give you a moderately priced new item once when you have the baby.", "Okay, NTA, but she's not totally wrong to be hesitant about an old crib. Regulations about cribs change and some (like the ones that have drop-down sides) are considered legitimately dangerous for babies by today's standards. Same for car seats. You need one that's never been in an accident, and if you're getting one second-hand from a stranger, you can't know that for sure.\n\nAlso, a lot of places that give away baby clothes actually do have stuff that's brand new--either because the donor bought it off season or because their baby outgrew it before they had the chance to wear it. And some newborns are born too big for size \"newborn.\"", "NTA", "NTA. I just love it when people who have nothing are unwilling to compromise.

Find another cousin", "NTA.\n\nNo r/ChoosingBeggars allowed!", "Babies outgrow clothes in a few weeks. Would be ridiculous to spend money on brand new clothes for them they will only wear for a month. Any reasonable parent would be excited at saving money on these things. \n\nI was so thankful for any hand me downs and am preparing to pass on a lot of what we have my son has outgrown to keep the cycle going. I hope the new parents do the same when their child outgrows them. No reason to fill a landfill with perfectly good clothes.\n\nAlso, spot cleaner/oxyclean is life changing. Can't believe how much it can do.", "Nta. remind your uncle that she's in this situation because he spoiled her from birth and if he's worried about her stress he can get all this stuff for her.", "Lol r/choosingbeggars", "NTA.  You didn't get her pregnant.  She should be grateful for any help you offer.  Start making distance between you and her because she's going to want lots of \"help\" even though she doesn't have a job.  Let her and the father figure out how to make this work.  I suppose you could arrange a baby shower if you feel generous.", "NTA. She will figure it out, or her parents will bail her out. My sister was lucky to be a nurse practitioner in a practice of well to do cardiologists. They made loads of money and one or two of them would give my sister bags of used expensive clothes their kids had outgrown. Between these overpriced clothes and stores that specialize in used kid\u2019s clothes she pretty much only bought diapers and sock and underwear new. She considered it a better investment to put the money in a college savings account.", "Just so I'm clear, her father has decided he won't support her.  This, after spoiling her for her entire life and not raising her as a competent adult.  And, he has accused you of giving her stress?", "NTA. Stay out of it.

Hard to beat free. Especially if you are broke.", "I like your method, 'get your ass off the couch' or use what you get.  She begs you for help but turns her nose up at what you think is a good thing, beggars can't be choosers... As fast as babies grow my wife and I, who can buy whatever baby clothes we wanted, loved going to yard sales and thrift stores for used clothing.  NTAH.", "NTA. Your uncle won't support his pregnant daughter but thinks you should. Hell no. Return her to her parents.", "NTA. If your uncle is so worried about your cousin's stress levels, why isn't he paying for everything? The only valid issue your cousin has is that the crib may be too old to be safe.", "Huh. Her dad is refusing to buy the stuff but is still treating her as daddy's little princess who shouldn't have to learn a lesson. It sounds like she's going to be just fine because daddy will break first and start paying for everything.\n\nI think you were absolutely right in how you handled this situation. I'm just sorry to hear that it's highly unlikely that the lesson will be learned here.", "NTA. I'd guess your cousin didn't tell the truth about you trying to help", "NTA OP.  Your cousin seems to be a bit of a snob.", "NTA. And if you uncle is so worried about it, then he can foot the bill.", "NTA. I think her parents have laid much more stress on her than you did.", "No you are NTA   You did what you could and were rebuffed.  I'm sorry.  That was an awful response to your kindness.\nPlease remember your cousin is hormonal, scared, and obviously unrealistic.  Try to let it go.", "She\u2019s a choosy beggar.", "NTA. Beggars cant be choosers, also, why didnt she find a job before getting this far into the pregnancy? I mean, Im assuming she was already aware of it, why couldnt she work at mcdonalds or smth before the preganncy got more visible. \n\nIf her parents \"dont want her stressed\" and agree with her not accepting hand-me-downs, maybe they should pay her top quality baby stuff", "NTA. Cousin is delusional and her parents are at fault. Take several steps back and let the 4 of them figure this out. Time to focus on your non-relative friendships. Life will never be the same for again and that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA. Let her join the mommy & me, freebie groups and have her do it herself.

I wouldn\u2019t want hand me down clothes for my newborn either, unless it was from family. I hope somebody throws her a baby shower.", "NTA\n\nI suspect she told uncle a different story to what actually happened.\n\nHe can support her seeing as he's her father.  He doesn't seem to want to... perhaps he needs to treat her nicer.\n\nActually he's not in the wrong with what he's said to her ie she and the father need to support the baby.

Portable (until laundry time) and lasted until we were able to crawl out.", "> She also wanted the shower to be potluck, and she wanted one of our other coworkers who had the largest home with a huge patio to host it there. Basically she wanted to spend nothing on this shower but get a ton of stuff out of it, for the baby of a girl none of us had ever met.\n\nDamn, that lady has balls bigger balls than the state of California.", "NTA. Your co-worker was being ridiculous; if it was her baby I'm sure the office would've either had a shower or sent a card around to collect signatures and money.

She had a set of 4 strollers, including a fancy Italian one and a fancy Italian bassinet or bed but also a crib that became a bed.
