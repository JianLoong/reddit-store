His parents were very generous and paid for the trip. We only went to Disney for one day, as we had a wedding the next day. \n\nI did not enjoy Disney. It is just not my idea of a good time. It was humid, lines were long, and Z\u2019s parents bought us matching Mickey Mouse ears we were expected to wear. Z\u2019s mom also insisted we wait in line to meet multiple characters, and made us take pictures and talk with the characters as though they were real.\n\nWe had to be ready by 7:30am, so we could be in the park as soon as it opened. We stayed until shops closed at midnight. My feet and back were killing me by the end of the day. I wore my comfiest sneakers and still had blisters. I felt dehydrated/queasy all afternoon from too much sun. I was so relieved when the day was over. \n\nI guess Z\u2019s family is a Disney Family and before 2020 they went to Disney every year for a week. My in-laws want to continue their annual disney trip and have started planning one for this fall. We are all invited for the whole week. \n\nI told Z that I barely managed one day last year, and I would rather stay home. Z got kind of upset and said I should just suck it up, it\u2019s his family\u2019s thing and it\u2019s not hard to smile and have a good time. He said his family would be hurt if I didn\u2019t go. \n\nI suggested that if it was that important I join in on the trip, I could fly down for the last day or two and join them in the park after they\u2019ve done character meet and greets in the morning. Z was offended by this and said it was rude to act like meeting characters was beneath me. (I think we are all adults and meeting characters at this age is just hugging sweaty strangers in animal costumes.)\n\nI realize it sounds ungrateful, but I hate Disney! This is not what I want to spend my very limited vacation time on. I also don\u2019t want my in-laws to spend thousands of dollars on park passes and flights for me to be miserable for a week.

Given that she talks about the humidity, I'm thinking OP is going to Florida.", "I have to disagree with your nobody\u2019s the AH assessment. His parents are absolutely AHs, and her betrothed didn\u2019t fall far from the tree.", "We didn\u2019t start dating until 2019. They didn\u2019t go that year due to a family surgery. They didn\u2019t go in 2020 and 2021 for obvious reasons. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom has some Mickey and Minnie apparel but my fianc\u00e9 does not. At least I didn\u2019t think he did. His mom pulled out two bins of Disney clothes from their garage right before we left. They also enjoy traveling generally and usually do an annual trip elsewhere in the world too, so I did not realize Disney was an annual thing as most of their pictures are from more exotic places.", "Disneyland is very different than Disney World. There's a lot more to see and do at WDW.", "Ha! I was an Italian major. We developed our own circles of hell one class. I had Disney sandwiched between rush hour traffic and student loans. After last year\u2019s experience, I should have placed Disney much higher!", "I would happily go on almost any other trip with his family! I\u2019m pretty adventurous. I would probably not be willing to do a Disney cruise, as I don\u2019t support Disney on principle and would not enjoy being trapped on a ship and forced to feed in to the Disney consumerism. But I would be open to any trip that does not involve Disney or voluntourism.", "This isn\u2019t a family vacation if everyone isn\u2019t allowed to have a say on what to do or if everyone is forced to stay together at all times. You\u2019d probably have more fun if you were able to choose your own things along with group things. If you don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t. But if you\u2019re willing to go as long as you can do things you enjoy, make that known. Are the brother and sister dating? Do their partners go? Or do they stay home? Maybe they can bring their partners and there can be a United front on people splitting off from the group if they like, and you can have other people to hang with when the family decides to do family stuff you don\u2019t feel like doing.", "So you are an adult and can set boundaries. I think you and your fianc\u00e9 need to talk about this further in order to get to the middle ground. \n\n\u2026..and do you really do what people say and ignore your needs because you\u2019re afraid of passive aggressive texts? Girl who cares. Stand up for yourself.", "They are treating you guys as children. Speak to your husband. If he wants you to go then you need freedom to go back to the hotel to rest. To get on rides of your choosing. His parents need to compromise.", "This sounds terrifying. I may have just watched too much Black Mirror, but I\u2019m scared for you, OP.  NTA", "There are absolutely character meet and greets in every park.", "Aww, thanks \ud83d\ude0a", "Yeah Disney World is a whole different beast lol", "Oof... I hate to say it, and I know it seems like a \"small\" thing, but this may be a deal breaker for your relationship. You will be having this fight *every year for the rest of your life*. \n\nEither you find some kind of compromise that you and Z both are happy with-- and more importantly, that Z will support you 100% when it comes to setting this boundary with his parents..... or you maybe shouldn't get married. \n\nNAH", "I get not supporting Disney but thats a SUPER important convo for you and your partner to have! I think as long as you keep an open mind and are willing to compromise it\u2019ll be okay but if this is their big, only thing they do as a family either understand that you are alienating yourself and its not their job to change plans for you! Also you should be ready to accept your kids doing these things with that side of the family even if you don\u2019t go!", "I told Z the text from his parents was ridiculous and he agreed but didn\u2019t want to upset them further in the moment. I didn\u2019t feel it was my place to rock the boat during my first big vacation with his family. Which is why I am rocking the boat now instead by declining to attend future Disney trips. :)", "That\u2019s not rocking the boat that\u2019s hiding from confrontation"]}
