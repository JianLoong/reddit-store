His parents were very generous and paid for the trip. We only went to Disney for one day, as we had a wedding the next day. \n\nI did not enjoy Disney. It is just not my idea of a good time. It was humid, lines were long, and Z\u2019s parents bought us matching Mickey Mouse ears we were expected to wear. Z\u2019s mom also insisted we wait in line to meet multiple characters, and made us take pictures and talk with the characters as though they were real.\n\nWe had to be ready by 7:30am, so we could be in the park as soon as it opened. We stayed until shops closed at midnight. My feet and back were killing me by the end of the day. I wore my comfiest sneakers and still had blisters. I felt dehydrated/queasy all afternoon from too much sun. I was so relieved when the day was over. \n\nI guess Z\u2019s family is a Disney Family and before 2020 they went to Disney every year for a week. My in-laws want to continue their annual disney trip and have started planning one for this fall. We are all invited for the whole week. \n\nI told Z that I barely managed one day last year, and I would rather stay home. Z got kind of upset and said I should just suck it up, it\u2019s his family\u2019s thing and it\u2019s not hard to smile and have a good time. He said his family would be hurt if I didn\u2019t go. \n\nI suggested that if it was that important I join in on the trip, I could fly down for the last day or two and join them in the park after they\u2019ve done character meet and greets in the morning. Z was offended by this and said it was rude to act like meeting characters was beneath me. (I think we are all adults and meeting characters at this age is just hugging sweaty strangers in animal costumes.)\n\nI realize it sounds ungrateful, but I hate Disney! This is not what I want to spend my very limited vacation time on. I also don\u2019t want my in-laws to spend thousands of dollars on park passes and flights for me to be miserable for a week.

You only spend so much time away from work and spending an entire week doing something you hate every year is a hard pass from my perspective.\n\nIf I had to spend a week at Disney doing the most childish of activities at the park I would lose my mind. These are fucking cartoon characters.

You could sell it to the mil because they offer the character meet and greets (with shorter lines) and no roller coasters, but also doesn't include long waits or lots of walking for you.

You could join them for diner or something?", "NTA\n\nI had no interest in Disney even when I was a kid and it sounds like a complete nightmare and waste of money.  I just don't understand people who can't let others live and let live!", "Coming out of a pretty perpetual lurk mode on reddit because I feel uniquely qualified to weigh in here - I married into a Disney family. \n\nI went once as a kid, enjoyed it, never longed for more. \n\nWhen I found out my wife's (girlfriend at the time, of course) family had been going annually or bi-annually for 15-20 years I was taken aback. They're in the vacation club so when they go down, lodging is paid for, so when I was invited to join, I did (used points to fly down there and even with the price of food on site, pretty good deal!). I love theme parks, but the rides at Disney are to me, by and large, pretty tame and not worth the time spent in line. Going down that first time, as an adult surrounded by adults who were Really Into All Of It, was surreal. I enjoyed some things (epcot is pretty neat/has a vibe I appreciate, and a few of the rides at hollywood studios were fun) but wasn't sure how I'd feel about going down routinely.\n\nWe've gone down lots since then, but with a compromise/understanding that I'm just not going to go to the parks every day - some trips I haven't gone at all when they've gone multiple days. One thing I appreciate about Disney is that there really is quite a lot to do outside of going to the parks. It's made much easier provided you're staying on their property, because if so you can get anywhere without too much hassle (other than waiting for 1+ busses). So I'll chill in the room, by the pool, etc... Sometimes solo or sometimes my wife will come too. Or I'll go out to downtown disney for a walk, or see a movie, or go to a different hotel to have lunch, etc etc. But I'll have breakfast with everyone before they leave, or I'll take a bus to meet them for lunch somewhere, or see them in the evening and on non-park days. \n\nI think your offer to come down for a couple days at the end (and join at the park after they've done character stuff) is reasonable. That said, if his family is unwilling to accept that, then they may not accept a solution where you come down for the length of the stay but don't follow their itinerary exactly. But to me, if they want you to join in their tradition, they need to meet you part way. NTA of course!", "Nta", ">why can\u2019t you and the fianc\u00e9 go but just do your own thing??\n\nYou've never met Disney adults or families obviously. The very idea of not doing exactly what they did last time would be the ultimate insult in their book. It's a way of life.

I\u2019m so ready to see my boys eyes when they see the castle", "I\u2019m going to deliver a heavy blow to you here:\n\nHer future children might not want anything to do with Disney. Her future children might have sensory issues, mobility issues, or just be deeply adverse to hauling their asses all over creation for it. For some us, Disney ended at the movies and we\u2019re all still up, functional, living, working jobs.\n\n\u201cWould she want to deny her kids that?\u201d Maybe, yeah. It\u2019s an absolute batshit amount of money to go dick around at the altar of capitalism until your body can\u2019t take anymore. I could get my daughter a ton of interesting experiences for the price of a Disney vacation that will be just as wonderful. \n\nIf Disney is the only thing this family can pass on to the next generation, then I ca. confidently say my child\u2019s Barbie\u2019s have more depth to offer.\n\nIt\u2019s. Fucking. Disney.", "DistributionDue511 is right. You need to have a talk with Z about what he sees your future being like in regards to Disney. My sister's family is a Disney family and has been for a couple of decades. (Their childrens' entire lives.) It used to be one week-long vacation a year,  but I think they are up to 2 visits that may last 2 weeks at a time. Their adult kids go, the boyfriends and girlfriends go, and I expect they'll take the grandkids when they come along as well. Disney weddings will almost certainly be in the future. They do the long days, the extra hours, the character meals and pics, the whole nine yards. For them, it is a magical experience,  and they have every right to enjoy as much time as they can with their families at Disney. I don't think anyone should judge them for that, and I love the closeness they all have, at least partially helped by their beloved family vacations. \n\nBut,  that isn't what everyone wants or enjoys. Having different ideas about the future isn't a crime,  but trying to force your idea onto another person is going to make both people miserable. If a new family member doesn't like it, one of two things is going to happen. The new person is going to use all their vacation time and money to be miserable. They might have to sacrifice going places they would prefer and money they think would be better spent somewhere else, which sounds horrible. They may miss out on the experiences they think bring magic into their life and want to share with their partner and build happy family memeories around. \n\nOr, the person they care about is going to miss out on one of the most important times they have with their family, one of the things they love best in the world, as well as the plans they had to bring the same traditions to their kids. That is going to be a hard sacrifice for either party.\n\nSo talk to your fiance and find out how he sees this going for the rest of his life. Maybe you'll find out he can take it or leave it. Maybe it is extremely important to him.  Better to know now.\n\nAlso that control by his mom is not okay under any circumstances. You're going to want to find out if he is able to or even wants to establish boundaries with her before you get married. A miserable vacation at Disney is only the first drop in the bucket if he can't do that. Holidays, meals, family visits, the list of ways to make you miserable is endless.", "Brilliant! I can work remotely about 30% of the time. I\u2019ll consider this option if Z continues to die on the Disney hill. \n\nIt certainly felt like a hostage situation. My parents are pretty active (in better shape than Z\u2019s parents) and I can not think of a time they were willingly on their feet for sixteen hours straight, or expected me and my siblings to follow suit! But my family usually just rents a beach house for vacation so people can be inside or outside doing what they want while still in close proximity to everyone else. So my expectations for a vacation were admittedly a bit different than Z\u2019s coming into this.", "It was not my wedding. Z and I are still engaged. We all had his cousin\u2019s wedding to attend the next day, a few hours from Disney. The wedding was originally the reason the whole family was going to Florida. Z\u2019s parents just decided we should go a day early to also go to Disney. Sorry for the confusion.", "I considered this. I would be fine going and spending the week sitting by the pool and joining everyone in the park for a few hours in the late afternoon. But my future in-laws would be paying for everything and it\u2019s been implied that if they are funding the trip, we accommodate their wishes. And their wishes are lots of time in Disney. Before anyone asks why I don\u2019t just pay my own way so I can make my own schedule: I am a social worker. I do not make enough to pay for my own flight and lodging in Florida for a week without eating into my meager savings, so if they aren\u2019t paying I would not be attending.", "This is super helpful, thank you. I do like thrill rides and alcoholic beverages so I think I would have enjoyed Hollywood studios or Epcot a bit more, though still not enough to go multiple days in a row. \n\nWhen you met your wife and in laws for lunch on days you didn\u2019t go to the parks, did everyone have to leave the parks to meet you somewhere since you did not have a ticket? I don\u2019t see my future in laws wanting to leave the park for lunch.", "Jesus Christ they sound insufferable. Unfortunately, like most people have said, you\u2019re either going to have to suck it up or set some boundaries. Doing some stuff together with everyone is great, but you wanting to do non-little-kid stuff is 100% valid and don\u2019t let them try and convince you otherwise.", "So this is your FMIL\u2019s vacation, and you are a piece of the entourage; necessary to round out those happy family photos?", "This is more like family torture lol", "Lmao sorry but I think acting like the characters are \"real\" as adults is so strange. It's a grown up in a costume. I do not need to waste hours standing in a line up and it's ridiculous to force other to do so when it's your jam. Do it by yourself if you love to do it, people should be allowed to do their own thing!!\n\n(I would never mock someone for doing it, I just wouldn't join in and meet up with them later)\n\nSounds like you're better off compromising by only joining for a couple days after all the meet and greets, and make sure to give yourself some breaks in the day to sit and eat/drink water!", "For as many years as we\u2019ve been, we still plan every day. You can\u2019t get the most out of it by just winging it. We never regret the planning, and now teach our kids the value of spending that time.", "Ah - but we know how to go at the good times with less heat and fewer crowds. Granted, it\u2019s not as easy as it used to be, but we never leave there thinking we didn\u2019t get our money\u2019s worth.  But, I can completely understand your point of view. I, for one, would never go to Times Square on New Year\u2019s Eve, even though it\u2019s on the bucket list for many, and is probably epic. People like what they like.", "My cousin\u2019s family is a Disney family (not so much anymore now that everyone is grown with kids of their own, but especially when they were kids and teenagers), and it just bewildered me. They went at LEAST once a year if not more, and I just don\u2019t get it. Granted I\u2019ve never been to Disney World, only Land, but even as a kid the cons outweighed the pros.", "The best is when they\u2019re about four or five, and meet a princess face-to-face for the first time, because they really remember the movie.

OP you are NTA.", "Op also literally said Disney world", "This exactly.  It's not a family vacation when one person dictates the entire itinerary at the expense of everyone being able to enjoy themselves.  My family is definitely a Disney family, but even when we were kids, my parents understood that not all of us wanted to do the same things.  We would split off for a ride/attraction, meet back up, do something together, split off again, etc. so that nobody felt that they were sacrificing fun.  \n\nThere's SO much fun stuff to do at Disney, especially if you have a whole week to visit different parks, and I truly believe that there's something for everyone.  It's really unfortunate that your initiation involved so much time standing in line to meet characters as an adult.  If you decide to go back with them, it needs to be with the understanding that while you're happy to do certain things with them, you're a whole adult who has every right to set and enforce boundaries regarding which activities you're willing to do (and for how long) and which you will be passing on this time around.", "Yes planning is essential!
