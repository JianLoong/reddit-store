{"id": 20329, "submission_id": "14gaps3", "title": "AITA for forcing my step daughter to cut her hair?", "selftext": "I (31) met my husband (34m) 8 years ago, and we have been married for 6. He has an 11 year old daughter from a previous relationship. \n\nI work from home so I mainly end up taking care of her. I have since she was young. We have a generally good relationship. She stays at her mothers most weekends. \n\nShe has incredibly long blonde wavy hair, just past her bottom. It\u2019s a nightmare to take care of. It frequently tangles and she always needs help brushing and styling it before school. I\u2019m not a morning person and I do not like having to wake up early to do a kids hair. It\u2019s expensive to maintain as she requires more products, she insists on using hair oils which can cost around $11 and only last a few weeks. She also insists she has to use curly hair shampoo instead of regular shampoo and conditioner which is often over $10 per bottle. And she goes through it at a fast rate. She won\u2019t use a regular brush on it as she insists it breaks her hair and hurts so she uses a wide tooth comb which takes a long time to brush when she could be doing other more productive things such as homework or helping me with chores. \n\nI decided she had become obsessed with her hair, and I do not want her to become vain, so I decided it needs to be cut. I don\u2019t see it as a big deal as I have always had shoulder length hair as my hair does not grow very fast and I get frequent trims. It\u2019s a lot more practical. \n\nI took her to the hair dressers as normal. In the car on the way down she said she wants to make sure the hairdresser doesn\u2019t cut too much. I politely explained that I would like her to cut her hair to shoulder length as it has become a burden. \n\nAt first she thought I was joking, but when she realised she started to cry. When we got to the salon, the hairdresser was reluctant to cut her hair due to her tears but I explained the trouble we have maintaining it, and assured cutting it would be best for her. In the end the stylist agreed and cut her hair. The stylist braided her hair then cut it. She kept it. Her hair was now just past shoulder length, and looked a lot darker. The car journey home was silent, I offered her McDonald\u2019s but she refused. She went straight to her room when we got back. \n\nMy husband went up to see her when he got home and apparently found her on her bed sobbing holding her old hair. My husband immediately called her mother to come and collect her and as soon as my stepdaughter was out the door, he started yelling. Her mother also came in and gave me a mouthful. \n\nI explained my reasoning but my husband wouldn\u2019t budge. He said if I had issue he would have did her hair in the mornings and that he didn\u2019t mind paying for the products. He was so furious he said he no longer trusts me around his daughter, and doesn\u2019t know if he can be with a woman who he doesn\u2019t trust with her. This broke my heart. \n\nI didn\u2019t mean her any harm, I was just so tired and I\u2019m trying to reduce stress. I\u2019ve always been the one to raise her and her brother and I\u2019m just exhausted.

In fact, you're one of the biggest assholes I have ever seen on this sub.\n\nI would categorize what you did as abuse.  The child didn't want her hair cut, the salon didn't want to do it, and you just couldn't be fucking bothered to speak to one of the girl's parents (both of whom have a relationship with her).  You made *her* hair all about *your* opinions.\n\nOn top of that, what you describe as being somehow a pain in the ass (special products, combs, etc.) is actually a very clear indication that the girl has been taking care of her hair well.  It's not like she just let it grow and did nothing to maintain it.\n\nHow dare you make this all about you?  Who the fuck cares if you don't like combing her hair in the morning?  The solution to that is to either have her do it herself, or talk to her father.  Cutting off the hair based on your own conveniences and taste is absolutely abhorrent.\n\nYou abused a child just so you could sleep a little longer in the morning.

She\u2019s not your daughter to decide anything about.", "YTA. It's her body, not yours. Her hair is healthy, she knows how to care about it. It's not like it was damaged or she wasn't taking care of it. It sounds like you just wanted to do what was easy for you, not taking her feelings in account.

You don't see children as people and you certainly don't respect your stepdaughter.", "YTA - she didn't want you to do it, she has a relationship with her bio-mom, and her dad, and you didn't bother to consult either of them.

You violated her bodily autonomy. \n\nIf it\u2019s such a drain on you, you should have been teaching her how to care for it herself, and giving her an allowance she can choose to spend on hair products. 11 is plenty old enough to be learning personal hygiene and budgeting. If you\u2019d done those things she may have come to the haircut decision on her own. But instead of taking the opportunity to teach her about independence you\u2019ve taught her that her body isn\u2019t really hers.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re worried about her vanity, you need to guide her by teaching her about the importance of inner beauty, not humble her by removing something she loves.", "You knew she loved her hair and you plotted behind everyone\u2019s back to have it cut off in the most painful and hurtful way possible.

He needs to kick you to the curb.", "[removed]", "YTA and I suspect you know it - else you would have discussed this with your husband first.\n\nYour husband is right - this is a huge betrayal in trust.  Marriage is a partnership, and you did not act like a partner.  Plus, his daughter is a major part of his life, and his daughter's hair was important to her.  \n\nYou hacked it off because it was inconvenient to you, despite it causing her a great deal of distress.  She's 11, she is old enough to decide to have long hair.\n\nYou have now forced your husband to choose between you and his daughter.  I don't think that will work out too well for you.", "YTA. Better call a lawyer now because divorce is going to be your future. This is not your child, you had no right to force her to submit to a haircut without involving her parents. If you were so sure you were right, why didn't you mention it in advance to your husband, her FATHER? Why didn't you talk to her FATHER about you thinking the products were too expensive? Why did you sneak around to take her to the haircut? If I were her parents, I would be having a few words with the hairdresser for cutting a child's hair without parental consent.", "Wow.  Definitely YTA.  You made your stepdaughters hair about yourself and didn't give one thought to how she felt.  You didn't even talk to the girls mother or father.  You need to grow up and realize the world does not revolve around you.", "YTA and a huge one at that. I feel sorry for these children if you're who is raising them. You effectively took over her bodily autonomy and forced her into doing something she did not wanna do. All so that you could be a lazy, entitled piece of I'm not gonna say it as to not get banned but let your imagination run free. The icing on the cake? Her dad had no issue paying for her products and doing her hair himself. Alsl info: are you literally jealous this little girl has better hair than you and is probably a million times prettier already than you have or ever will be??", "YTA,\n\nAnd not because you didn't ask her parents but because you did it knowing she didn't want it done. You had her hair cut against her will and while she was in tears. You can't be trusted around her, your husband is 100% correct about that. You do not respect her autonomy over her own body. \n\nAnd your complaints about the products costs are ridiculous. She is a preteen. Good quality products cost a bit more but are worth it. \n\nI am a mom with wavy hair with one daughter with curly hair and two with wavy hair. I spent money on their products when they were young and spend money on mine. My curly-haired daughter's stepmom did something similar with a haircut when daughter was about the same age and it was the beginning of the end of their relationship. As an adult my daughter has nothing to do with her stepmom.", "YTA \n\nFirst you clearly do not understand how curly/wavy hair works. Second as a NON parent you had no right to make such a decision on your own.", "Yta. You didn\u2019t even consult him when making such a huge decision. You are a STEP parent. You are not allowed to overstep the authority of her parents at all. You messed up big time by being entitled and whining. Very selfish behavior and I hope her father sees that in you too.", "How can you even be unsure? YTA.  \nThis is such a disgusting thing to do, you literally violated her bodily autonomy? \nAnd i mean the insecurities you\u2019ve gotta have to think a little girl wanting to take care of her hair is \u201cobsessive and vain\u201d", "yta, this is why everyone thinks us stepmothers are all a\\*\\*holes.", "How do you not tell your husband that you were getting annoyed with doing the hair every day? I would be pissed if my wife didn\u2019t tell me that and I assumed everything was fine and then I come home to a distraught daughter because she was forcibly made to cut her hair by someone else. \n\nYTA. Just a horrible job of communication and selfishness. You got to find a way to make it up to her. Might not be able to but 100% you need to give some special treatment if you want to stay with your husband.", "YTA. I would be livid with you if I were this child\u2019s natural mother.

You thought you were being nice by raising his kids for him, then you became frustrated, and that\u2019s when you stepped out of bounds. \n\nGoing backwards:\n1. You never force a haircut on anyone, especially a child - their egos are so fragile.\n2. The moment you became frustrated with her hair you should have stopped doing it and either put that responsibility back on your husband or your stepdaughter.\n3. Repeat after me: \u201cThese are not my children. It\u2019s not my job to raise them.\u201d\n4. You should never agree to raise someone else\u2019s children.

She played sports, and before she played she would take it out and brush it to put it back up. I would hear people ooo and awww over it and say how beautiful it was.

He has an 11 year old daughter from a previous relationship. \n\nI work from home so I mainly end up taking care of her. I have since she was young. We have a generally good relationship. She stays at her mothers most weekends. \n\nShe has incredibly long blonde wavy hair, just past her bottom. It\u2019s a nightmare to take care of. It frequently tangles and she always needs help brushing and styling it before school. I\u2019m not a morning person and I do not like having to wake up early to do a kids hair. It\u2019s expensive to maintain as she requires more products, she insists on using hair oils which can cost around $11 and only last a few weeks. She also insists she has to use curly hair shampoo instead of regular shampoo and conditioner which is often over $10 per bottle. And she goes through it at a fast rate. She won\u2019t use a regular brush on it as she insists it breaks her hair and hurts so she uses a wide tooth comb which takes a long time to brush when she could be doing other more productive things such as homework or helping me with chores. \n\nI decided she had become obsessed with her hair, and I do not want her to become vain, so I decided it needs to be cut. I don\u2019t see it as a big deal as I have always had shoulder length hair as my hair does not grow very fast and I get frequent trims. It\u2019s a lot more practical. \n\nI took her to the hair dressers as normal. In the car on the way down she said she wants to make sure the hairdresser doesn\u2019t cut too much. I politely explained that I would like her to cut her hair to shoulder length as it has become a burden. \n\nAt first she thought I was joking, but when she realised she started to cry. When we got to the salon, the hairdresser was reluctant to cut her hair due to her tears but I explained the trouble we have maintaining it, and assured cutting it would be best for her. In the end the stylist agreed and cut her hair. The stylist braided her hair then cut it. She kept it. Her hair was now just past shoulder length, and looked a lot darker. The car journey home was silent, I offered her McDonald\u2019s but she refused. She went straight to her room when we got back. \n\nMy husband went up to see her when he got home and apparently found her on her bed sobbing holding her old hair. My husband immediately called her mother to come and collect her and as soon as my stepdaughter was out the door, he started yelling. Her mother also came in and gave me a mouthful. \n\nI explained my reasoning but my husband wouldn\u2019t budge. He said if I had issue he would have did her hair in the mornings and that he didn\u2019t mind paying for the products. He was so furious he said he no longer trusts me around his daughter, and doesn\u2019t know if he can be with a woman who he doesn\u2019t trust with her. This broke my heart. \n\nI didn\u2019t mean her any harm, I was just so tired and I\u2019m trying to reduce stress. I\u2019ve always been the one to raise her and her brother and I\u2019m just exhausted.  AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I knew adults, who were jealous of the happiness, glow and self assurance of children and teens and would try to knock them down. \nThe prices of the products, OP mentioned are drugstore btw, so it\u2019s not like the girl is demanding Pureology or Olaplex or Kerastase etc. 9-11$ is very affordable for a curly hair product. If OP doesn\u2019t even know that, she probably never cared about her own hair routine, wich is her decision and completely fine but she also never bothered to check, that there aren\u2019t many cheaper options for curly hair.  Also, money seems wasn\u2019t the real issue, as the father was ok with it. And the time? OP seems to be of the opinion that doing housework is a better use of time for the girl than self care, wich can easily become a future problem, when the girl wants to be a normal teen. Also, curly hair doesn\u2019t look as easily good at shorter length on many people than straight hair and takes years and years to grow back. Depending on the curl patter, 4-6 years of growth easily have been taken off, as curly hair is so much longer than it looks while in the curl pattern and often you don\u2019t see growth for a long time for that reason.\nMy daughter had to make some choices, since her hair is her priority, so we gave her a budget for her beauty, self care routine and she decides what\u2019s important. \nBut to this day at 14, I actually need to wash her hair out sometimes because of the build up and the scalp can be hard to reach for her in the back because of those tight curls. I do it because I love how happy she is when her hair looks good.", "The OP describes the hair as \u201clong blonde wavy\u201d so\u2026", "Regretting a haircut is a rite of passage. \n\nHaving years worth of hair chopped after a full on meltdown resisting is\u2026well I wouldn\u2019t trust my kid with her either.", "the dad mentioned how if that was the case that he would've paid for the items himself, so I think he probably wasn't aware. not trynna argue tho, so sorry if it comes across that way!", "I had butt length straight hair at that age and it was still a nightmare.  Braiding it in pigtails at night really improved the morning routine.  If the girl's hair is truly wavy vs curly they could try a wet brush, those yank out a lot less hair.", "YTA you neglectful fuck :) \n\nNot wanting to get up in the morning because of her hair (because she has different hair to you) and complain at her for wanting oils and such to maintain her hair is neglectful. And yes curly hair will need different types of products for her hair to be managed, a quick fucking google would tell you that. She is 11! And it seems she was trying to look after it and such and because you're a fucking lazy fuck made her cut it cos you are not a morning person and her hair takes time and money, like are you deranged?", "YTA. So much. Wicked step-mother reporting for duty.", "Why don't you shave your head so you'd spend less on hair products and time to be more productive doing something else?\n\nNow imagine being forcefully being shaved against your will and tell me you are not a massive asshole.", "I, a 28 year old woman, cut my hip-length hair to my shoulders for all the reasons you describe. When I saw myself in the mirror I cried, for hours. Hours turned into days and I became obsessed with googling hair growth tips and trying all sorts of pills and potions to get it to grow back. \n\nI wept any time I looked at myself for too long. \nI became completely alienated from myself and didn\u2019t recognise nor even remotely like what I saw in the mirror. \n\nHair is not just an accessory (for most). It forms a part of your identity. The only saving grace for me was that at least it was a decision I made for myself, and I learned about myself along the way. My hair has grown to my back now and I feel reconnected to my identity. \n\nYou literally chopped off your SD\u2019s identity for your own selfish wants. She\u2019s likely too young to fully process her emotions or understand why she\u2019s feeling what she\u2019s feeling - but make no mistake, her feelings are real and valid and they\u2019re not likely to go away. Congratulations on ruining your relationship with her (and her dad, and her mom) to save yourself the horrible (?) task of having to brush her hair. Some of my fondest childhood memories are with my mum softly brushing my hair while sat between her legs - it\u2019s tactile bonding. I can\u2019t imagine how void of maternal instinct you must be to not only hate doing that, but to hate it so much that you enforce your will onto her to cut it off and remove the need. \n\nThis might be one of the worst things I\u2019ve seen in this sub. Seriously evil step-mom vibes. YTA a million times over.", "> I\u2019m not a morning person and I do not like having to wake up early to do a kids hair.\n\nFriendly reminder this is her step daughter. At no point does she refer to her as such, or in anything close. \u201cA kid\u201d makes it sound like this kid wandered in from the street.", ">YTA. You did this **without the child's parents' knowledge or consent. You did it without the child's consent**. If the routine was causing problems \n\nNah, it does not matter \"the routine was causing problems\". I can see major legal issues in the future for OP.", "Doing it without even discussing it to either parent first is so insane. Especially since it's hair she's basically been growing her whole life. This isn't a spur of the moment decision. Cutting that much hair is something you plan and talk about first, even when it's your own child. The fact that no one knew beforehand suggests that she just woke up and felt too lazy to do it and just decided to cut it off instead.", "[she's worse then a Disney Villain she's Joan Crawford](https://youtu.be/rr6eufh4DA4)", "Yes.  I don't know where you are from but I'm in the US and there was a similar issue local to me where a child's hair was cut by a person who was not their birth parent and they were found guilty by the courts.  I don't remember the punishment but it was all over the news which is bad enough.", "I wondered about that, I cannot imagine an 11 year old sobbing over her hair and the stylist still doing it.", "She had to have known she was wrong because of how she went about. If she thought she was in the right, she would have discussed it with the child's parents. She decided to ask forgiveness instead of permission and FAFO.\n\nMy daughter's half-sister's hair sounds similar to the OP's stepdaughter's. One time when she was visiting, my mom took her to get her hair done. Full on conversation with everyone about what her plans were, etc. the stylist cut minimal off but worked with her to learn how to manage her beautiful hair better. My mom also bought a lot of necessary products. Thick, curly hair requires extra care. But it's worth it!", "VERY WELL SAID! She was on a power trip and now, I HOPE SHE PAYS THE PRICE for that trip!", "My mum was like that for a long time. Her mum cut her hair super short as a kid so she was mistaken for a boy. This was to discourage male attention and my mum had trauma over it. She refused to cut her hair until fairly recently. (She's 62 now for reference)", "I have naturally curly hair too and my mom used to make me keep it super short, like a boy's hair cut until I was like, 12.   People always mistook me for a boy.   I'm 45 years old and still give her shit for it and make a point of letting my own daughter decide how long she wants her hair.  I will NEVER force her to keep it shorter or longer than what she wants.", "I\u2019d be in jail for assault", "I think I'd ask her to show me a picture of what she wants, to be sure she understands it.  But other than that, yeah, it's her hair.  Won't harm her to have it short, or colored, or whatever she wants to try.  (Let's use temporary color for the first try though, OK?)", "That was where my thoughts were going as well but a mix of Snow white step mom feel because of jealousy. The way she worded and mentioned some things with her own hair gave a red flag.", "I have naturally curly hair. I didn't meet my black friend until I was in the 6th grade. Her mother is AWESOME! She gifted me a stick of cocoa butter and taught me how to smooth some into my hair so it wouldn't frizz. I was a tomboy that didn't do much with my hair: wash, brush it wet with conditioner in it, rinse and go. She told me that I should do more than that and it didn't take that long or that much.

We always leave it long as that's what he likes but hair does need cutting occasionally and he always panics that we're going to cut it short and has a meltdown first.", "My husband's family always talks shit about my boys' hair when it grows out to lengths they don't like. Regular haircuts for 3 boys get expensive. But also, who cares?", "I think that you are forgetting the huge cost of the oils at $2.50 per week. Don\u2019t forget the financial burden that is less than a latte.", "She knew what she was doing was wrong or she would have told her husband and his ex wife.\n\nIt's so sad knowing the father would have done her hair!", "Some of each. I think she wanted it in the first place out of laziness, but once she decided she wanted it, she wasn't going to let anybody get in her way -- including the girl's own parents, for crying out loud. If I were here husband, you bet I would be moving myself and my kids out over that.", "Or it's an excuse, when the real issue is \"She could be doing things I want her to do with that time, like helping me around the house.\" I'm not sure which, but she sure seemed eager to have that extra time at HER (not the child's) disposal.", "Mayhap dad should complain to the salon.", "They've probably never even tried to show her how to care for it. My daughter has curly hair and she's about to turn 11. There are things nobody ever thinks about and certainly not a child if they've never been told. Wide tooth comb, yup. Condition in the shower and run the comb through bottom to top or you will never get that comb out of the tangles. Leave in conditioner while it's wet. Never, ever brush it dry or brush it period just wide tooth combs.

You are demoted from 'stepmother', lady!", "My mom thought my hair was too long (she was very obsessive about my hair growing up) when I was 15 and not only had it cut above my shoulders, but had it permed too.

When I had very long hair I got shampoo and conditioner that were $80/bottle each.", "One time my parents got annoyed with my hair so they tried to use my dad's mustache trimmer.

When she was little she wanted it long. So we bought the shampoos, deep conditioners, leave-ins, oils and combs. Was I grateful when she started doing her hair? Oh heck yeah.

I actually liked having long hair, but my dad HATED it.\n\nThat said - I had a good father - and he just bore with it, because it was my body and my problem. I kept my hair until my mid-university study abroad when my grandfather made me an offer: If I cut off my long hair and kept it short for 1 year, he'd give me $1,000 cash. Completely my choice if I valued my hair or $1,000 more.\n\nI cut it all off to just longer than a buzz cut, got $1,000, and am proud to have donated the long hair to make wigs for kids with cancer...
