So I agreed and then Saturday rolls in, I go to the bridal shower, mind you this is my first ever so I had no clue what I was getting myself into. So Janice prepared everything, a dress, shoes, flower bouquet, flower crown and a bridal veil. And when Kim arrived, Janice gave everything to her. So I thought it was something  Janice prepared for Kim. The party was ok, with like 7 people. \nAnd then as the party ended, I asked Janice, how much should I contribute considering everything and she laughed off and said noo are you crazy? I am happy you could make it. \n\nWell, that was it until today when she messaged that all of guests, ie the 5 other people, owe her $200  EACH and she wanted me to Venmo it to her. And I dont work.
