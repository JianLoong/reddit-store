(Pertinent info: her and I come from very different financial backgrounds growing up - her family being much more wealthy than mine.) \nFor the first year of living there we didn\u2019t watch much television, therefore we didn\u2019t have one. As time went on, we both began watching more tv. We always watched stuff on her laptop or our phones, but after a while it just didn\u2019t cut it and we talked a lot about getting a tv for a while. That year for Christmas my wonderful mother gifted me a brand new 50something inch smart tv. \nA few months later my roommate was getting something out of the coat closet next to the tv stand and knocked it over - breaking this thing so far past return I almost cried when she told me. She felt bad and said she\u2019d replace it. Then a week or so later she brings home a tv from her parents house. She said her mom took the opportunity to upgrade the tv in their guest bedroom and give us their old one.
