Though about a week later, I find out from my sister (14F) that my parents are bringing home a new dog without mentioning anything to me. I asked why they were getting another dog, and they said it was to mend the hole in their hearts. It was a German Sheppard puppy named Harley. Problem was, our other dog Ginger, a weiner dog mix did not like her at all. Ginger was the same when we first got Tank as a puppy as well, so they didn't care. My family later introduced her to my sister's kitten, Lily who was about 2 months old at the time. Big mistake. Harley was not gentle with her, so we constantly had to isolate them, which was difficult as my dad insisted the cat should often be upstairs with us.\n\nAround a week later, my dad excitedly showed me a Kijiji ad for bulldog puppies, claiming it would be a good fit for Harley since Ginger doesn't like to play. I got annoyed, and immediately told him that I did not agree with them getting another dog when we already are barely home for the other animals. (My sister and I are at school and my parents both work, so they're all left alone most of the day) I told him I did not want the responsibility of this dog, because I knew that I'd have to be one to help out with it. I asked what would happen if our current dogs didn't get along with it, and they just shrugged. Later on, they still brought home the dog, and like I expected, Harley was not having it. Harley would try to play with the new puppy (Jax) and she was far too rough. Two days later, I went downstairs to say hi to Harley and everyone else. I asked my mom what they planned to do with Harley's behavioral problems. Her answer was that Harley was leaving in around 20 minutes to go back to the rescue they got her from. I was heartbroken. I didn't want the dog I loved to be thrown away and replaced in a matter of days.\n\nIt's been about a month since then, and I have not grown fond towards Jax at all. I know that Jax is still a puppy and doesn't know any better, but that still doesn't make me want to care for him. He is extremely annoying, he barks every night after putting him to bed for hours at a time, and keeps me awake. He always makes a mess of his pen. He rips up his pee pads, then pisses on the floor. He constantly needs to be watched so that he doesn't shit in the living room. Jax also is not gentle with the cat, and is constantly hurting her.\n\nI hate to say it, but I hate this dog, and I hate that I am scolded for not wanting to take care of the family dog even though I obviously stated I wanted nothing to do with it. It's not fair to me, but it's also not fair to my sister that I bail out on her because I don't want to clean up after it when we come home from school.

Your parents on the other hand are a problem. Puppies are cute but they are a huge responsibility and require quite a bit of training. Especially German Shepards as they are typically working dogs and can grow bored easily. Pets require attention and training and it seems like your parents like the idea of owning animals but not the responsibility that comes with it. Also returning any animal to a shelter, rescue, etc just because you got a new puppy is awful. I could rant about this for a while but for time sake I can assure you that you are NTA. Your parents need to look into puppy training classes and need to take responsibility for the puppy. You should not be stuck in this position because of your parents poor planning. Yes it\u2019s not the fault of the puppy but I understand the resentment and disdain for the puppy and your parents. There\u2019s been a whirlwind of emotions with the recent pet changes and you haven\u2019t even had time to grieve. Your parents have such a strong track record of neglect they shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to adopt an animal or own an animal period.", "Nta.

You are a child, yet you are for more responsible than your parents who keep getting dogs after dogs without taking care of them. They like the idea of having dogs, not actually dealing with the reality of having dogs.\n\nI am so sorry you had to see Harley go.\n\nI think you are displacing your anger towards what happened with Harley and, deep down, with the fact that your parents are abusive towards living creatures that you love. And the more you love them the more you end up suffering. Jax being loud is the perfect manifestation of everything that goes wrong and you latch onto it and direct all your anger towards it. Deep down, i don't believe it's Jax you hate.", "NTA. NTA. NTA.      Since you are 17 I would react by preparing to move out ASAP when you turn 18.  You have the right attitude about pets, they do not.  That must be heartbreaking to watch and have no control over.", "NTA You are a child. Your parents made a careless decision and expect you to take on the responsibilities, when you very clearly told them it wasn't a good idea. I have two teenagers at home. I surprised them with a puppy before. We all love him, he's wonderful. Yes, sometimes I get frustrated when he has had an accident (not at him and not at my children) but I am the one who brought him home. I am the one responsible for him. Yes, my children help out when I ask them to but I do NOT expect them to. He's a great dog, he's very loving but not the best-trained dog (not in a bad way) but I am the first to say it is MY fault when he hasn't been fully trained. This is a very unfair situation you are in. I'm sorry your parents didn't consider your very valid points before bringing the puppy home. Again, you are NTA.", "NTA. your parents are  irresponsible pet owners. You have set a boundary and been the voice of reason. Animals are not inanimate things and without supervision and training your pets are headed for disaster. Stand your ground and please try to protect the others from being hurt by the no we puppy. PS: no doubt your parents mean well and love animals, but they love them without thought to the animals needs.", "NTA but it sounds like your family are terrible dog owners. \n\nHowever, it's unreasonable to be upset with Jax because he, a puppy, isn't being cared for properly. Most of your issues with him that you've listed could be solved by taking him out for a walk more frequently. He's a puppy and he's got a small bladder - when he needs to go he needs to go. And yes you do need to watch him constantly until you learn how frequently that is and start to preemptively take him out. Let him sniff around and run a bit while he's out and he's going to be less anxious and destructive too, he might even sleep better at night. The blame for his behavior lies squarely on the humans who are failing him.", "NTA. You are a child. This is 100 percent on your parents. My heart is breaking for, quite frankly, all of those animals. Even your sisters kitten. Surely its not happy in this enviroment, and its basically lost its security in its own home since the dog is not gentle. I hate that your parents have put you in this position, but this isnt your fault or your mess to fix. Its theirs. Although, I will say that those behaviors should seriously be like, trained out. Sooner than later. Because the longer you wait the harder itll be.", "Nta", "NTA. You clearly voiced your concerns and opinions. Your parents are not respecting your time or autonomy. This dog is not your responsibility. I'm sorry your parents are adding and removing members to your family on a whim and without asking you. That's hurtful and unfair.", "NTA but your parents are massive AHs. They have a track record of acquiring dogs and making no effort to train them. They returned a dog to the rescue rather than it. They keep aggressive dogs that are a danger to your cat. Your parents are horrible pet owners. If they don\u2019t want to put in the time to care for a puppy, why did they get one? I\u2019m sorry you, your sister, ginger, and the cat are stuck living like this.", "I'm not sure, I doubt they would do much about it. It also would likely just dig a deeper hole for me if I did.", "I never thought of it that way... you're right. I take my anger out on him when I'm always mad at my parents. Though, even if I were to talk to them about it, they wouldn't want to hear it.", "This really made me feel better, thank you. Also I think you made a great choice.", "I agree it will get worse, but they brush it off as \"they're just playing\" and \"the cat doesn't run away\"", "Yes, I think exactly the same way, but was worried I was being too harsh. Thank you", "Call around.  They had a dog who was so poorly trained it had to put to sleep.  They rehomed other dogs, and now they are failing to train this puppy.  There's a strong pattern of abuse and neglect. Your parents should be blacklisted from pet adoption and lose custody of that dog.  I don't know if it's possible but this is a slow moving tragedy.", "That's the problem. That and that you can't easily leave and live on yout own so you have to endure. Psychologically speaking, it's easier to lighten the blame you put on them, even if it's artificial, because it allows you to be able to stand the situation.\n\nI think therapy would help, but your parents don't seem to be the kind to talk and most important listen and try to understand. Though i do recommand therapy for you one day, because i think there is a lot that you have had to normalize to make it acceptable and it will tremendously help with that", "It fucking SUCKS but honestly for YOUR own benefit, even though you dont really like the dog right now, its prolly gonna be best if you commit to yourself that youre gonna train the fuck outta this dog. Maybe even the time together will help you bond, and even if when its all done and hes trained well you dont really feel a bond, at least you can rest easy knowing he will be a lot less work. I mean, still a lot. Hes a dog. Dogs are work. But its way less work to deal with a trained dog than one you have to be constantly on guard for.", "This^. The level of irresponsibility with the parents is astounding.", "When we had the first dog put down, the vet apparently said it was for the best because he wasn't \"domesticated enough\", so I don't know if that would classify as abuse or something. They didn't bother to try and train him tho because it wasn't guaranteed it would help", "I might have to, but will probably need to wait since it doesn't even know it's own name yet. That's a really good suggestion, thank you", "When dogs reach adulthood and are biters, the majority of the time they were poorly trained or untrained. \n\nThere's a few obnoxious dogs that respond well to training but it's not a large number.  \n\nSorry OP, but your parents probably could have prevented that death with frequent training and maybe some professionally taught classes.  Unless the dog was part coyote or wolf, I don't know what the vet means about domestication.  He could have said that to make them feel better."]}
