We all live in 1 house which my father pays for. My father lives abroad\u2019s and sends money for the household bills. I do not pay rent money although I do have savings to do so. My father refuses our money (including my mothers who works full time). He will not allow any of us to pay towards \u201cshelter\u201d as he believes it\u2019s his duty to provide such for his family regardless of their age. So yes, to conclude,  we all live rent free together. To add, I cook 4-5 times a week, I wash up almost every night, I clean all bathrooms, I do all laundry, I clean after my nephews. I iron my mums work clothes. I pay \u00a3200+ in groceries from savings. \n\nEdit #2: it seems my being unemployed and living I\u2019m fathers house rent free triggered a lot of folk. I dunno what to say to this except\u2026. It is what it is? But how does this excuse my sisters behaviour and entitlement to free childcare?\n\n\nSo my sister is staying with us with her kids (3 of them, 3, 5 and 7)  for the foreseeable future. Long story. \n\n\nThe 5 and 7 year old go to school/nursery full time. The 3 year old stays home. \n\nI am currently unemployed and admittedly, do nothing but recover from burnout from work, watching tv, gaming, social media etc \n\nAlso, as a result, I have a very bad sleep pattern which means I head to bed around 8am-11am and wake up between 2pm (earliest) and 5pm. (Latest)\n\nOn the days I am up before school run, I watch him while she picks the other 2 up. Although, very reluctantly because the  3 year old makes me very uncomfortable and I worry he will seriously injure himself whilst under my care and I don\u2019t want that responsibility. I say this because I think it\u2019s highly likely he is severely autistic. Non verbal. Bangs his head/hurts himself, has random zoomies etc\n\nPlus, I actually really am not a fan of children. I find them highly annoying and overwhelming and I am staunchly childfree. Id rather not be around kids cuz they make me uncomfortable and burdened.\n\nHowever, recently I got so fed up and annoyed with the burden of FREE BABYSITTING, and started pretending to be asleep to get out of it. At first, she let me be and took him with her but now it has resulted in my sister banging my door, shouting my name, sending the 3 year old up to scratch and claw at my door etc to get me to wake up and watch him. \n\nI\u2019m a light sleeper, so on the days I am actually sleeping, I will be wakened by the noise and this angers me to no end because I cherish my sleep. Like\u2026 what the f*ck? How dare you??\n\nSeriously, how hard is it to put shoes and coat on and take your kid with you? Not like she\u2019s walking 3 miles to pick them up. It\u2019s a 10 minute drive. And her car is parked right outside the front door. \n\nSo it all came to a head and I went to complain to my mother about it. Lo and behold, my mother revealed my sister already complained to her about the same thing and said that she would \u201cdisown\u201d me for not watching her kid and said I was a useless auntie.\n\nHow audacious.\n\nI sent her a text saying \u201cI disown you too, look after your own kids, you had them, not me. You\u2019re so entitled\u201d\n\nShe read the message and ignored it. \n\nWe have now not spoke for over a week. (I don\u2019t actually care, we weren\u2019t that close anyway and at least I can sleep in peace now)\n\nMy mother also took her side and said I should watch him and help her out. Obviously I think they\u2019re both wrong and very entitled.\n\nSo AITA for not waking up to watch my nephew whilst sister goes to pick up the other kids?", "created_utc": 1702687130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jew5z/aita_29f_for_not_waking_up_to_watch_my_nephew/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you wanted to occasionally that\u2019s one thing but shouldn\u2019t be expected to. I am raising two of my grandchildren. One 7 and one 17 months old. I have to take the 7 year old to school and pick her up. No bus because we live only 4 blocks away. This requires me to get the little one in and out of the apartment twice a day. I have severe physical limitations for my age. It\u2019s hard for me to get him in and out twice a day. It was worse when I had to carry him. I get very tired having to. Since he learned to walk it hasn\u2019t been as bad, but still tiring. I only do it because their parents won\u2019t take care of them and I\u2019m the only one willing to. My child would pawn them off on anyone literally so to keep them safe I do it without any help from their parents. If I can do that twice a day with problems, your sister should be just fine doing it since she chose to have those kids. She shouldn\u2019t be pawning them off onto others. If your mother feels so strongly, she should interrupt her work day ti come take care of your nephew while your sister is doing the school run. Otherwise I don\u2019t feel anyone should tell you that you should. Not your circus not your monkeys!", "I\u2019m not going to give any judgement here, just some insight. I used to be big on driving, have done multiple 24hour road trips with just rest breaks and food stops, no actual hotels or anything to hear of. I prefer to be out and about. I have 1 son (no extra long trips since having him.)Prior to having my son, prep for leaving the house included me getting dressed and stuff, then rattling off \u201ckeys, phone, wallet\u201d and leaving. Now, if I\u2019m taking him on a car ride, assuming I\u2019m not going somewhere that I actually need to stop and be for a while, just for the car ride alone i need stuff for 1 bottle(he could get hungry anytime), diapers and wipes, at least 1 toy for the car, 1 teether, a thin blanket and a heavy blanket, a hat, socks, shoes, and sometimes gloves for my son. The previous routine took approximately two minutes from checking that I have everything to leaving the driveway, currently, it takes at least 30 minutes to get out of the house from the time I\u2019m fully ready to the time my son is safely buckled into his car seat and snuggled up with a blanket and his car toys, and if he needs a diaper change on the way somewhere it takes even longer because I have to find a public bathroom with a changing table as it\u2019s the winter and cold so just changing him on the seat of the car is a no go right now. So, no your sister isn\u2019t entitled to your babysitting, but frankly if you could find it in you to do it it\u2019d probably be a lot easier on her, because it takes at most half an hour of your time, and half an hour of her time while she picks up the other kids, but if you don\u2019t babysit it\u2019s probably closer to 45 mins- an hour to make the 10 minute drive there, grab her kids, and drive 10 minutes back, because even though he\u2019s not on bottles anymore and idk the status of potty training on ur sisters kids, the rest of that list is still stuff she needs to check off in addition to her own stuff", "NTA you help plenty doing cleaning and laundry.

Because I agree that her kids are her own and from your description, it really doesn\u2019t seem like taking her son with her should be unusually onerous. However, as you yourself pointed out, if your theory about him being autistic is correct, perhaps that short ride to and from the school really is significantly more stressful than I think. From what you describe, m the whole trip takes about 20-30 minutes\u2026at least when she\u2019s by herself. With a potentially autistic 3 year old with her, does it take significantly longer?\n\nIn any case, I still agree that these are her kids and their childcare is ultimately her responsibility.

I can understand the logic you\u2019re using\u2014the world around is very difficult and expensive and I need to focus on my mental health\u2014but couldn\u2019t your sister use almost the exact same logic? I do see the difference\u2014your father is willing to support you all and you are not willing to babysit\u2014but the difference rides so finely on your good luck to have a father willing to do this and your bad luck to have each other as siblings that it doesn\u2019t sway me either way. Additionally, you have this dual view that you don\u2019t have a choice, but you also say quite clearly that you have the savings to pay rent, but don\u2019t, and could be working, but don\u2019t.  You say you\u2019re burnt out as though you must choose a job that is as stressful as whatever job you previously held and there are no other jobs in existence, but if your sister said she was burnt out from being a single parent and was leaning on family for her mental health, your argument would just be the truth: you just don\u2019t feel like helping so you won\u2019t. It\u2019s your right and I think when it\u2019s all added up it doesn\u2019t make you *the* asshole in this scenario but it makes you sound like a little bit of *an* asshole. \n\nSo I think what\u2019s leaning me to my choice is the fact that you both went complaining to your mom, who works full time and likely thought she wouldn\u2019t need to be dealing with either of you at this level: ESH. It sounds like you and your sister have sorted it out now by simply ignoring each other so you get to continue sleeping in and she (presumably) takes her son with her to get the other kids, but you all stressing your mom out about this makes me sad for her and annoyed at both of you so I\u2019m going with both of you suck here.", "You\u2019re a loser.", "I just recently became unemployed after many tears of being burnt out in my work.
