They helped me understand that I was in the wrong and some provided me with advice on what I should do if I wanted to keep in contact with my daughter.\n\nI realised that I was living too much in the past and wasn\u2019t taking into consideration how much things have changed in the last 30 years. My father worked as an artist (paintings) and had little to no business, the only thing that saved my family from absolute poverty was my mother working in a supermarket. I guess I was afraid of such things happening to Jane.\n\nNow I hadn\u2019t talked to Jane about her degree until the last thursday, when I brought the topic up she confessed to me that she was ready to take one of the degrees I had recommended to her. I told her there was no need to and she looked at me as if I was playing a cruel joke, I reassured her that I was being serious and she began crying (due to happiness).\n\nI realized that I may have been favouring my sons due to their obedience to follow what I asked of them and was punishing Jane for being herself rather than fitting into whatever I decided to make of her.\n\nJane will be attending Oxford Uni later in the year to take her degree and the relationship between us has never been better.\n\nI am highly appreciative of all the comments on my previous post, they helped me see how much I was prioritising financial gain over my daughter\u2019s well-being, something which should have never been a question in the first place.", "created_utc": 1680553461, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12awlv0/update_aita_for_choosing_not_to_pay_for_my/", "score": 357, "replies": ["Amazing news! I am so happy you read and listened to all the comments, I remember your origional post. Lots of well wishes to you and your daughter.", "This is what I love to see, Assholes taking the judgement they've been given and deciding to change for the better rather than staying stubborn.\n\nWishing you and your daughter the best OP.", "Fantastic news! Also Oxford is a STELLAR school, so she should have no problem finding work with a degree from there.", "Hey, man. Props to you.\n\nNot many folks are willing to admit when they've messed up. You, on the other hand, listened to the advice of thousands, and recognized where things went wrong.\n\nHer English degree could easily allow her to spend even more time traveling the world and teaching. She may not become rich, but she'll be comfortable and happy... which is really what having a good life is about, isn't it?", "Oxford is arguably the best university in the world. A degree in playing Candy Crush from Oxford would probably help set you up for life!", "I'm glad to see that you came around. Not all people who make bad decisions are bad people - I hope that your relationship only grows stronger as time passes.", "Oh thank god that you realized that Oxford is an excellent school and you're not just investing in her future earnings but her happiness.", "I remember reading the original post so this is an awesome update. I am so glad that you and your daughter are in a much better place! Always keep working on yourself! We are never too old to be better.", "Great to hear this. It takes a lot of courage to examine our actions and admit we made a mistake. Good luck", "Thank you for actually listening and learning. Your original post made me furious. A university degree is worth what you put into it and how you apply it. I have a BAH and an MA in English literature, and I work in my field. Last year, I made more money than my partner, an engineer. Good communication skills are needed in every company in every industry. Let her explore and find a career that provides her with an income and creative outlets. And a degree from Oxford? She will have no problem finding opportunities.", "Thank you for being the type of man who admits when they were wrong, apologizes, and fixes it. I wish your daughter and your family all the best!", "good dad", "Acknowledging your flaws and resolving to do better going forward is the mark of greatness.  Kudos to you, OP!", "Congrats to Jane! Remember an English degree undergrad can open many interesting doors - librarians, English teachers, linguists, journalists, authors, English teachers, lawyers, so on. Hope she enjoys it, and glad you both are doing better now!", "That\u2019s excellent. Congrats on your daughter getting into Oxford! And don\u2019t worry about her not making money. If nothing else, there are plenty of teaching opportunities for somebody with an English degree from Oxford.", "Oh wonderful news! Thank you, and I wish you all the best!\n\n(Oxford is no small thing!)", " You have a smart, independent daughter who knows herself and what she needs, and who listens to herself and fights for herself, even against her own dad who she probably admires more than you will ever know. AND she got accepted to freakin' Oxford? You have every reason to be proud of her.", "Love this update! We appreciate growth on this sub. All the best to Jane with the path of her choosing!!!", "OP, thank you for this update! I wish Jane the best of luck in her studies, and I'm delighted that you are supportive!", "Love this update, well done. Personal growth is so encouraging for us all to see, I'm sure.", "Wow and English degree at Oxford? Good for her! \nIt\u2019s nice when AH get a redemption arc and I\u2019m glad you and your daughter have a chance to have a good relationship again.", "So glad this all worked out. Jane is going to have an amazing time there, and of course you must visit her!", "English degree at oxford??? damnnnnn that's legit", "I'm so very happy that all of the comments helped you see the situation from a different perspective. And I'm glad that you've been able to make peace with that new perspective - and your daughter!", "Glad that you guys worked it out! The creative degree will come into play randomly throughout her life. Maybe even help her homeschool kids, if she goes that route! I wish you all the best!", "Yay! I love positive updates. Great job, Dad!", "The best type of update!!", "Congrats! May you and your daughter have a wonderful future.", "Glad you listened and changed your position. I hope she enjoys her studies!", "Awwww I got ONIONS IN HERE!!!", "\u2764\ufe0f", "Good on you for realizing you were in the wrong, May you both be happy and successful", "Oh, OP, aren\u2019t you wonderful!  \ud83d\ude0a. The hardest thing for us parents to do sometimes is admit when we are wrong and apologize.  I\u2019m so proud of you!", "You're a good parent.  I'm proud of you.", "I really hope you learned your lesson here, she excepted in OXFORD and you pulled this with her\u2026. Never thought I\u2019d ever say a sentence like this but buddy you are lucky as hell you came to Reddit and they put your ass in its place. Good luck", "YES ! You go dad ! That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for to help people, understand and learn from all of our mistakes. Your daughter is going to do amazing !", "I'm sorry, but all that whining about her degree to suddenly throw in that's she's going to OXFORD\n\nLord almighty", "I remember this post. So relieved you took the advice to heart and have improved on your relationship with her! Nice work!\n\nAlso, I wouldn't worry too much about financial gain. The fact it's Oxford will mean a lot. And as someone who got her degree in English (Writing and Rhetoric, no less, which is as old time as it gets even though it wasn't so long ago), but who is making six figures not a decade later (yes, in the field), she has every chance of doing just fine for herself.", "You\u2019re being a great parent to your daughter, I guarantee you she\u2019s never going to forget this.", "Its great to see someone taking the advice from this place and using it to fix or improve their situation. Kudos to you OP, your daughter will never forget this and I\u2019m sure your relationship will only continue to improve.", "I remember commenting on your first post. I'm glad you changed your mind. I can only imagine the relief your daughter feels now.", "Happy cake day", "It sure is. Yay, Dad!!", "ikr? I couldn't believe the original post. Imagine a parent telling their kid, \"nope, sorry, you can't go to OXFORD\" because it's not good enough for them. Glad they changed their mind.", "I truly love the phrase, \"You're never too old to grow.\" I'm about to turn 40, and I hope I'm still growing when I'm 80.", "Holy crap, this was about an English degree at Oxford? I totally back the fundamental premise that you don't owe your adult kids paying for college if you don't see it as a worthwhile investment. But Jesus I would have thought it was underwater basket weaving at some scam art school. An English degree at any good university can be used towards innumerable professions, unlike the narrowness of say pre med which if you don't have the chops to be a doctor might be 4 years wasted.", "It sounds like he really took on board what people had said. It takes a big person to admit when they're wrong, so good on him!", "Some people would rather their child be miserable barely passing medical school until failing out eventually than d doing well at something they actually like.\n\nAnd they have the gall to say they love their children unconditionally. Disgusting.\n\nI would be willing to bet at least one of the sons would have rather been something else than a doctor.", "If you aren't growing, you're dying :P"]}
