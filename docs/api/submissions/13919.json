They helped me understand that I was in the wrong and some provided me with advice on what I should do if I wanted to keep in contact with my daughter.\n\nI realised that I was living too much in the past and wasn\u2019t taking into consideration how much things have changed in the last 30 years. My father worked as an artist (paintings) and had little to no business, the only thing that saved my family from absolute poverty was my mother working in a supermarket. I guess I was afraid of such things happening to Jane.\n\nNow I hadn\u2019t talked to Jane about her degree until the last thursday, when I brought the topic up she confessed to me that she was ready to take one of the degrees I had recommended to her. I told her there was no need to and she looked at me as if I was playing a cruel joke, I reassured her that I was being serious and she began crying (due to happiness).\n\nI realized that I may have been favouring my sons due to their obedience to follow what I asked of them and was punishing Jane for being herself rather than fitting into whatever I decided to make of her.\n\nJane will be attending Oxford Uni later in the year to take her degree and the relationship between us has never been better.\n\nI am highly appreciative of all the comments on my previous post, they helped me see how much I was prioritising financial gain over my daughter\u2019s well-being, something which should have never been a question in the first place.", "created_utc": 1680553461, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12awlv0/update_aita_for_choosing_not_to_pay_for_my/", "score": 6273, "replies": ["Amazing news!

An English degree at any good university can be used towards innumerable professions, unlike the narrowness of say pre med which if you don't have the chops to be a doctor might be 4 years wasted.", "It sounds like he really took on board what people had said. It takes a big person to admit when they're wrong, so good on him!", "Some people would rather their child be miserable barely passing medical school until failing out eventually than d doing well at something they actually like.\n\nAnd they have the gall to say they love their children unconditionally.

Two jobs people constantly cry about being underpaid - with libraries often being closed, no less - are meant to be the immense opportunities created? \n\nI hope she\u2019s smart enough to use her undergraduate foothold as leverage to study law, or something more appropriate, at Oxford later. Otherwise it\u2019s going to be a wasted opportunity on an investment that will never come good.", "Dang, I'm happy for the update, and glad you two are doing better, but I can't help but wonder if your sons are happy too? You were favoring them for their 'obedience', which sounds terrible. Like, they aren't dogs, they're people. I hope the relationship with all your children are good.", "We\u2019ll done dad.

Thank you for sharing.", "Lots of Englis, politics, history, language and humanities grads go into banking, law, management and strategy consultancy (particularly with a degree from Oxford). \n\nFYI, partner/MD in those industries often pays GBP2m+ a year.

When I was 15 (in the Netherlands that's when you've finished your basic education, between 15 and 17 depending on your level of education) anyway, at that point I had to choose an education and my preferred career path. I don't know about other people, but at 15 I hadn't a clue about what I wanted to do career wise, I was busy being a teenager and having fun. I thought I wanted to work with horses, and chose an agricultural based education specializing in everything to do with horses. Not realising by doing this, I was basically setting myself up for failure. Mostly working with horses later on means, working for people that can afford having horses, doing their dirty work. Obviously my parents saw this coming and warned me, but I thought I knew better. My mom chose this way of doing things because her parents did choose her education for her and didn't let her do what she had wanted. She ended up doing it it later on anyway, when she had met my dad and they started their live together and he always supported her. Together they've been an amazing team and have always fully supported my and my siblings. (they still do) eventually I did realise I made the wrong choice and went on to get higher education and went on to get a teaching job, which I absolutely love. I've specialized in preventing bullying and have set up an entire program for multiple schools. Iwas bullied a lot because I've got a serious form of scoliosis which affects my appearance.

I would study English at Oxford if I had the chance to, even if I didn't speak English at all. That's HUGE! Congratulations to your daughter.", "What a good dad. Good luck.", "I know. Was more annoyed at her taking an English degree than the university itself.\n\nKnow better now though", "Thankfully both sons had dreams that aligned with mine, although they didn't both become cardiologists but doctors in areas that they enjoyed :\nDermatologists and Neurologists.", "What the actual fuck? \"My daughter is reading English at Oxford\" is the sort of thing upper-middle-class types would throw out as a brag at dinner parties over here in the UK. It's like saying she's gone to some prestigious Ivy League place.", "How did you remember seeing thath she had an offer from Oxford? It wasn't mentioned anywhere in the original post", "Not just one of the best, but probably the most prestegious in the Western World.\n\nIf you get a degree from Oxbridge i don't think there's a single university that tops that prestige, maybe MIT or Harvard can match it in certain circles but overall nah.", "Please review the way you judge your daughter. \n\nYou see her as a 'black sheep' for wanting a very conventional degree because of the grudge you hold against your father. This has hugely impaired your ability to be a good parent and has no doubt caused significant strain in your relationship with your daughter. \n\nThe problem here has been you the whole time.", "Might be mixed up with the Cambridge guy\n\nEdit: Wait OP said it was Oxford in the comments", "How are there two posts this similar this close together?\n\nAnd funny how they both balance out the Oxbridge connection.", "That was gold lol. The UK isn't even big on professionalizing degrees. It's common to pursue a degree to show you have skills and the job then trains you in something different. I have had a friend that did Biology and he now works in finance, and this is not a rare occurence there. It would be where I grew up but not in the UK. English is also a degree that gives you relevant skills for the workforce and requires critical thinking, reading comprehension and good writting skills that are sorely lacking and are key, it's not something obscure at all. And in goddamn Oxford. Oxford dude. The name recognizion and alumni alone. How can he be so educated and yet so clueless.", "I got accepted into medical school after finishing my BSc degree. My father refused to help buy me a laptop for it, saying \"You've got one degree, go get a job\". Some dads are clueless", "An english defree from Oxford though? It's English, not Latin or Dance studies or whatever and it's Oxford. She may not end up working in the area as many uk graduates but if she does well in the degree I think she will be fine. Indeed I feel like there was an overcorrection in the job market where previously saturated areas are now needing professionals and previous areas that were considered to be very employable are saturated.", "I was referring to the fact that I know of at least one Oxford College here in the US.", "Ummmm - overseas fees for Oxford for English Language and Literature are ~\u00a335k / $44k PER YEAR. Is that really cheaper than a state school? Some quick googling suggests that average in-state fees in the US are about a quarter of that?", "No guarantees they would even get to do what they enjoy though.", "Sadly, that hasn't been true since Margaret Thatcher. It's all done with student loans these days.", "If he does go, they've also got a really motivated extracurricular motorsports society with vintage race team etc."]}
