We don't live together but we agreed to move together soon. He has a 16yo daughter. I gotta be honest, she seems quite stubborn and her own dad struggles to get her to listen. I'm not close with her which is something I know I need to work on and I fo my best. However, Her pranks make it difficult for me to maintain a good relationship with her. She loves to prank and her prank can be a lot sometimes though there's sometimes some humor there. I tried to laugh it off everytime she'd prank me but it's gotten too much lately.\n\n\nMy final straw was on her dad's birthday. I came to spend the day and have celebrstory dinner. My future inlaws and relatives came as well. All went well until dinner. We were about to have dinner and once we walked into the dining table, I was stunned to see my underwear hanging on a hanger in the corner. My stepdaughter looked at me, smiled and said \"of you forgot these last time you visited and I didn't want you to forget them again so I hung them here!\". I was absolutely astonished, speechless even. Michael was shocked and my inlaws and other guests INCLUDING Michael's friends were staring at me in awkward silence. I felt so humiliated, especially when some of the men laughed. Next thing I knew, I yelled at her and was grabbing my stuff about to leave and Michael and his daughter telling me to calm down it was just a prank. I left immediately and turned my phone off. Mivhael left many texts and voice messages calling me \"hypersensitive\" and claiming I ruined his birthday by walking out over a prank. We argued later and he said his daughter is a teenager and it's what they do so my reaction was over the top and ruined the birthday for him and his family.\n\n\nI haven't spoken to him in days and he's expecting I visit to apologize for walking out and also yelling at his daughter.\n\n\nAITA? DID i overreact?", "created_utc": 1680886399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12erlng/aita_for_leaving_my_fiance_birthday_after_my/", "score": 8632, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mean stunts directed towards you in the name of pranks. Please don't marry in to this family. Your fiance will never have your back based on what you said here", "She's not a prankster. She's a bully. And he's enabling her. Rethink this relationship. She isn't worth the effort. NTA. You reacted too late.", "This is what your life will be. The daughter treating you poorly and her father telling you you're overreacting. \n\nNo. Just no. Putting someone's underwear on display at a family gathering isn't appropriate, and your dude should have responded so. That he's blaming you tells me everything I need. DTMFA IMO.\n\nNTA. And do not apologise, ever, for responding as you have.", "NTA. Most teenagers do not pull pranks like that against an adult with whom they are not close. And it\u2019s a horribly mean and humiliating thing to do to someone no matter what your relationship is like. She is trying to get you out of her dad\u2019s life. I\u2019d oblige her.  And I\u2019d tell her dad that you aren\u2019t willing to subject yourself to years of being embarrassed and having your feelings hurt with his approval, which is exactly what is happening when he excuses her actions because she\u2019s \u2018just a teenager\u2019.", "NTA - you deserve to receive an apology from the rude, thoughtless teen who put your underwear on display.  This was not a prank.  This was a humiliation.  She did this to humiliate you in front of everyone.  And your fianc\u00e9 thinks you are the rude one\u2026\n\nReally??  Where do you think she learned that it is ok to disrespect and humiliate others??  And no one at that table stood up and said this is wrong??\n\nDo you really want to spend the rest of your life with these people?? Waiting for the next humiliation that everyone laughs at??\n\nYou deserve better.  In hindsight, at the first couple of \u201cpranks\u201d that crossed the line you should have explained that pranks are only funny when they don\u2019t seek to humiliate people.

Ugh I\u2019m so sick of people playing pranks at someone else\u2019s expense and then acting all high and mighty when the victim of the prank doesn\u2019t find it funny. \n>\nYour fianc\u00e9 and daughter are hiding behind the guise of a \u201cprank\u201d instead of what it really was, which was an attempt to embarrass you, disrespect you, and get a laugh at your expense.  \n>\nThey both owe you an apology and there needs to be firm boundaries set that you will not tolerate ANY pranks of any kind.", "NTA \u203c\ufe0f She\u2019s 16 and she knew exactly what she was doing \u203c\ufe0f", "Nope Don't apologize.\n\nYou were pranked, a cruel practice prankers think is funny & a majority of prankees HATE.

After she embarrasssd the fuck out of you in front of his family? Fuck that\n\nNTA", "NTA, When someone expresses they don't like pranks and then the pranks continue that's when it becomes abuse. I am sorry but you should seriously reconsider your relationship with Michael. He needs to fix things with his daughter before he can even think about adding someone else.", "NTA.

The awkward silence says everything.", "Dad is enabling some really poor behavior.\n\nThe natural reaction to a prank made in such poor taste is to remove yourself from the situation which you did.\n\nMichael enabled this behavior and is excusing it.\n\nMichael ruined his own birthday.\n\nHonestly the worst part is this daughter is *probably* going to struggle to have meaningful relationships in her life when she decides to CONSTANTLY teach her \"friends\" that you *literally can never trust her.*\n\nNTA - don't enable the \"it's just a prank, bro\" bullies.", "NTA, pranks are bullying unless everyone finds them funny. Being humiliated in public is rarely funny.", "NTA-she humiliated you and you get blamed for ruining the party and are expected to apologize. That's messed up.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be moving in with him until she\u2019s out of the house, and they owe you an apology.", "NTA. If I were you, I would think twice before marrying him. And they have to apologize", "You have a fianc\u00e9 problem, he\u2019s enabling her poor behavior by coding this as \u201cpranks\u201d. He should be standing up for you. The reason his daughter acts this way is because he allows her too. I wouldn\u2019t marry him. Not only is he a crappy parent but he\u2019s bad partner.", "NTA\n\nThis is not a simple \"kids will be kids\" type prank. 16yo is a bully through and through. That Michael is demanding an apology from you speaks volumes. His daughter went too far and should be the one apologizing. There are some serious red flags here -- please take the time to consider what it is you want in a healthy relationship as this isn't it.", "NTA. \n\nNo, I think your response was perfectly reasonable.\n\nThat being said, it was exactly the response she was looking for, and now she knows she can push your buttons to get you to leave her home.", "NTA, it wasn't just a prank, it's just mean. I really don't know how people can think it's funny.", "The daughter is nothing but a bully who hides behind \u201cit was just a joke\u201d to get away with it.

I've seen stories of teenaged stepkids doing this when they don't like the new stepmother/father for whatever reason.\n\nEither way, NTA. Pranks are only funny if all parties involved think so. This was bullying and humiliation, plain and simple.", " Being humiliated in public is rarely funny.", "NTA - So you are expected to apologize for the stepdaughter hanging up your underwear up at the dining table?\n\nI would reconsider marrying this guy, his daughter is a bully and he's ok with it. She's going to get way worse once you move in.", "NTA.  And teenagers do NOT just do this.  Most parents teach respect for others.", "That's not a prank that's a bully. I would ditch him since he can't parent his kid. NTA.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a prank. It was blatant humiliation and a power move. \n\nThis is something that she deserves some type of punishment over.", "NTA. I hope he starts discipling her soon. She's going to be a nightmare adult.", "NTA. You literally got publicly humiliated. Holy shit the brains in these people... if they even have one.", "NTA. You just got a glimpse of how your life is gonna be, at least for a few years, so view it as the gift it was and get away.", "Don't marry this man. Your story will always be about his daughter and the harm she causes. NTA!!!", "Pranks are rarely funny and are usually an excuse to be cruel. \"It'S just A JokE\" is what unfunny people say to cover for being just plain mean. This kid doesn't want you around and dad backs her up. Walk away or this will be your life.\nNTA and absolutely do not apologize. In fact, send him screenshots of this thread and then block him.", "NTA - she is trying to make you so uncomfortable that you will end your relationship with her father.\n\nIf you stay, since no one is calling her out on her pranks to you, her pranks will only increase and become more humiliating.", "NTA, dump him, he doesn't respect you.", "NTA\n\nPranks should be good natured and fun. If not everyone is laughing it is bullying. Daughter is clearly trying to make it known she does not like you. She doesn't have to like you, but she needs to learn to show respect to the people in her life. \n\nDisrespecting you should be seen as disrespecting her father and his choices. The fact that fiance does not see it that way is concerning and should be addressed before marriage.", "NTA, and that Michael was mad at YOU instead of his daughter tells tales.\n\nPerhaps it would be worth reconsidering if Michael is really the man you want to spend your life with. He threw you under the bus here, where else is he going to?", "Whether or not you're wrong, you're going to need to decide if this is the life you want to live. Do you want to live with a family who treats you like this?\n\nBut not, NTA. Sounds like the daughter is using poor coping mechanisms to stake her claim in her house, and your fiance is going along with it.", "NTA and you did not overreact. She deliberately humiliated you in front of everyone. And the fact that your fiancee is taking her side would make me take a long hard look at whether or not you want to marry him. Because3 she will always be in your lives.", "NTA \u2026 and do not marry this man.", "NTA. Michael didn't just raise an uncivilized bully--he fully intends to stay on that track. Do you really want to be with someone who would respond so abominably to a situation like that?\n\nShe ruined the celebration and he showed he has no intention of correcting her.", "NTA:\n\nBut did no one step up and defend you at that dinner?  Did no one see that this crossed a line?  Did anyone, mostly her dad try to get her to apologize to you?  And when he got mad at you for ruining his birthday dinner, did he see that any of the blame should fall on her?\n\nShe wants you out of her dad\u2019s life. That much is clear.  But you don\u2019t have a step daughter problem.  You have a fianc\u00e9 problem.  And I get that you need to support your children especially when you start a new relationship.  But this blind acceptance of bullying goes beyond support.\n\nShe wants you gone?  Give her what she wants or you are signing up for a lifetime of hell and abuse with no one to support you.", "NTA\n\nShe feels justified in doing these pranks because, when she did something completely inappropriate, he got angry with YOU and expects you to apologize.\n\nI'm really sorry that you had to learn that he doesn't have your back and will sacrifice your dignity for his bratty daugther. The good news is that you're not married yet and you don't have to live like this.", "NTA. But can we be honest here? The 16 year old isn't the issue. Your 'fianc\u00e9' is. He's rushing into a relationship with you whilst knowing his daughter isn't comfortable with you. He doesn't simply tolerate her 'pranks' - he actively encourages them. He then blames you for being upset - I mean, really? Wise up and move on, he isn't the one. Moving in with him 'soon' would be utterly foolish.", "NTA-don\u2019t contact either of them again, and do not marry this loser. YOU DID NOT RUIN the birthday party.", "Pranks are not funny. This was blatant disrespect. Expect more of the same if you continue in this relationship after fiance expects you to apologize. \n\nNTA", "NTA pranks are never funny, being humiliated is never funny. I would have walked out too.", "NTA. Your fiance's enabling is the reason the daughter doesn't change her behavior. Neither of them appear to value having you in their lives. Why would you stay with someone like that?", "NTA. And no, that's not what teenagers do. That's what immature people do, regardless of their age. As demonstrated by your fianc\u00e9. \n\nDon't apologize. You've got nothing to apologize for, especially to that rude brat and her idiotic father.\n\nI'd also add that this is what you're going to have to deal with once you're married. Think about what kind of life you'd have.", "NTA and no overreaction here because what she did was embarrassing for you. It's time to look deep and hard at the relationship and see if it's worth putting up with a step daughter who doesn't respect you and who might never ever after getting out of the teenage years. Sure you aren't marrying her, but how he defends her behavior is a good indicator of how things will go when other \"pranks\" occur.", "Why do you want to marry someone who allowed his daughter too bully you? NTA", "NTA. Your fiance isn't taking your feelings seriously at all. No one likes to be humiliated. He expects you to apologize when you have nothing to be sorry about. If anyone needs to apologize it's him and his daughter. I'd rethink this relationship if I were you because your feelings are being dismissed and I'm guessing this isn't the first time either.", "NTA \n\n>he said his daughter is a teenager and it's what they do\n\nIt's been a hot minute since I was a teen, but I don't remember ever hanging someone's underwear up for everyone to see. He's make excuses for his kid being a brat. Is this really the guy you want to marry and spend your life with?", "NTA I think you really need to reevaluate if you want to marry into this situation,If he can\u2019t/won\u2019t get his daughter under control .", "NTA, but you will make yourself one if you stay with the guy and his horrible daughter. That's not what kids do, at least none that I've been around. She is hateful and cruel, and falls back on the \"its a joke!\" Defense once she sees its gone too far.", "NTA. \n\nThe teen is an asshole, but you have a \"fiance problem\".", "Nta\n\nThat is NOT what kids do. Maybe his a-hole kid, but not normal kids. She clearly doesn\u2019t like you and is set on humiliating you.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t standing up for you.\n\nIs this really the life you want? You would be TA if you don\u2019t stand up for yourself, get a huge apology from both of them, and have any issues like this addressed immediately go forward. \n\nThere is no humor here, only malice.", "NTA, her behavior was inappropriate, and her father is condoning it. Don't apologize for anything. They owe you an apology. \n\nAnd don't let them guilt you into thinking you overreacted. She'll continue to act like that, and he'll continue to excuse it. \n\nYou should really think about whether that's a family you want to marry into.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t funny, you don\u2019t owe an apology.  You are owed an apology and even then I would end the relationship.   He didn\u2019t stand up for you and punish his daughter.", "NTA.  \n\nThis wasn't a prank, it was bullying.  Your fianc\u00e9's daughter is a bully, and instead of dealing properly with this behaviour, he is excusing it.  This man is not ready for a serious relationship, and he is not being a parent.\n\nToo bad it was such a shock, or you could have grabbed the underwear, and said in the most cheerful voice, \"Thanks!\" and then, while looking straight at Michael, \"You won't see these again.\" and then left.", "NTA. You need to slow down on your relationship with your fianc\u00e9 and his daughter. Don\u2019t move in and don\u2019t get married yet. \n\nIf this relationship is really important to you, then take the time it will need to sort out the family dynamics. He needs to respect your boundaries. You need to feel safe and respected in your relationship. The daughter needs whatever she needs.", "NTA. You did not overreeact. Your stepdaughter is SIXTEEN years old. And what she did was not a prank, it was CRUEL behavior.\nAnd the fact that Michael did not defend you should tell this relationship wont last.\nHope you find a really nice guy in the future and your stepdaughter finds someone that like to \"\"\"\"\"prank\"\"\"\"people just like she does and choses HER as target to be mean. Let's see if she will like that.", "NTA he needs to learn to control his kid. 16 is plenty old enough she knew exactly what she was doing and they're both making excuses for her. I wouldn't move in until he has an actual conversation with the kid about boundaries with adults. She shouldn't be going through discarded lingerie in her father's room that's crossing a line.", "Do not apologize, the family has a weird sense of humour, I bet few people share it", "NTA. I recommend cancelling the wedding, this guy just made it very clear he doesn\u2019t respect you.", "NTA\n\nThis whole family showed you who they are. Pranks are only funny when everyone laughs. This was straight up bullying.\n\nOP, please take time to seriously consider if you want to become a part of this family.", "NTA. Pranks are only fun if they're fun for everyone. What the kid did is bullying.", "NTA. A prank leaves everyone laughing. If someone is humiliated, that\u2019s just straight up bullying. Full stop. I would reconsider my relationship in this instance.", "NTA \n\nThat was not a prank, that was to humiliate you \nand since your fianc\u00e9 is enabling her, is this how you want to be treated?  Because they aren\u2019t going to change", "[removed]", "NTA, but I would go over there ONLY to, a) return anything of his that found its way to your home, b) get your stuff and c) leave the ring and his keys if you have a copy. Don't apologise for your reaction to a prank that was malicious in intent and if he can't see that, good luck to him in any future relationships with the way his daughter is acting. He needs to stop encouraging that behaviour because he is going to be very lonely for however long his daughter desires.", "NTA. A prank like that is expected of someone much younger then your step daughter. She\u2019s old enough to understand that that isn\u2019t okay.

It's awful. It was cruel and awful, and you are worth SO MUCH MORE than their treatment of you. Do not apologize. Stand your ground. She took your personal, intimate items and displayed them in a way meant to hurt and humiliate you. You did nothing wrong by yelling and leaving. You stood up for yourself when no one else did. Your fiance humiliated himself by not immediately sending that spoiled brat to her room and canceling all her privileges. Do not go back. He does not love you. That is not what love looks like.", "NTA", "NTA. I would have been livid if my kids did that to someone. You did not deserve to have that happen to you. I would seriously reconsider that relationship.", "NTA, 16 is not a little kid.", "NTA I have a teenager he doesn\u2019t behave like that nor has he ever done. My second is also a teenager and she doesn\u2019t behave like that either. Pranks can be fun for a laugh and if done at the appropriate time. This was done to be mean and embarrass you. You did the right thing by walking out. Dad is having trouble controlling her because he justifies her behaviour and lets her away with it. Poor girl needs to learn consequences before she upsets the wrong person!!", "NTA. These pranks are a way for his daughter to flex on you and make you feel inferior. The one with your underwear in front of everyone was designed to humiliate you and was done out of spite.

Daughter sounds obnoxious as fuck.", "NTA.\n\n\n>> he said his daughter is a teenager and it\u2019s what they do\n\nAbsolutely not. It is *not* normal for teenagers to go to great lengths to humiliate their parents\u2019 partners. These aren\u2019t \u201cpranks.\u201d This is you being terrorized by someone old enough to know better. \n\nThe fact that your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have an issue with the targeted bullying his daughter is carrying out at your expense should be a giant red flag flapping in the wind. Do you *really* want to marry someone who will dismiss your feelings and sit by idly while you\u2019re mistreated?", "NTA people who say something is a prank after doing something terrible are shitty people. She didn\u2019t prank you, she humiliated you in front of your future in laws. How your fianc\u00e9 could excuse that and then call you hypersensitive is beyond me.

We don't live together but we agreed to move together soon. He has a 16yo daughter. I gotta be honest, she seems quite stubborn and her own dad struggles to get her to listen. I'm not close with her which is something I know I need to work on and I fo my best. However, Her pranks make it difficult for me to maintain a good relationship with her. She loves to prank and her prank can be a lot sometimes though there's sometimes some humor there. I tried to laugh it off everytime she'd prank me but it's gotten too much lately.\n\n\nMy final straw was on her dad's birthday. I came to spend the day and have celebrstory dinner. My future inlaws and relatives came as well. All went well until dinner. We were about to have dinner and once we walked into the dining table, I was stunned to see my underwear hanging on a hanger in the corner. My stepdaughter looked at me, smiled and said \"of you forgot these last time you visited and I didn't want you to forget them again so I hung them here!\". I was absolutely astonished, speechless even. Michael was shocked and my inlaws and other guests INCLUDING Michael's friends were staring at me in awkward silence. I felt so humiliated, especially when some of the men laughed. Next thing I knew, I yelled at her and was grabbing my stuff about to leave and Michael and his daughter telling me to calm down it was just a prank. I left immediately and turned my phone off. Mivhael left many texts and voice messages calling me \"hypersensitive\" and claiming I ruined his birthday by walking out over a prank. We argued later and he said his daughter is a teenager and it's what they do so my reaction was over the top and ruined the birthday for him and his family.\n\n\nI haven't spoken to him in days and he's expecting I visit to apologize for walking out and also yelling at his daughter.\n\n\nAITA? DID i overreact?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would play a prank of my own. Go over there saying you want to make them a great dinner. Take a suitcase, pack all your things, give them man his ring back, and let them know that their behavior is the reason you are cutting them off for good. Then leave. The prank?  No dinner.", "NTA\n\nAwful and totally inappropriate. It wasn\u2019t a prank but an attempt to shame and embarrass you. The fact that dad doesn\u2019t see it that way, gave his daughter a pass AND tried to gaslight you into believing you\u2019re being too sensitive is beyond messed up. \n\nThere are basic boundaries that need to be set regarding respect. I\u2019m sure daughter is having issues with whatever happened between her parents and dad\u2019s relationship with you, but that\u2019s no excuse for her actions. I don\u2019t blame you for leaving. \n\nDo what you need to in order to put yourself into a position of being respected.

Up to you whether you want to keep working on it or agree and take your leave permanently.", "NTA - You clearly need to sit down and discuss why this was not okay with your fianc\u00e9.

He's not magically going to start disciplining his daughter after yall get married.", "NTA, that\u2019s not a prank, that\u2019s nasty. Calling you hypersensitive is just downright demeaning.

In this story, her entire purpose was to get people to laugh at you in a mean, cruel, humiliating way. She's bullying you.\n\nDo you know why she might resent you so much? Are you closer in age to her than her father? I have to ask since you gave only her age, so it could be her acting out against her father but not feeling able to speak with him directly about this. However, his reaction - to support her cruel bullying instead of you - tells me you don't just have a future stepdaughter problem, you have a future husband problem.\n\nWhat she did wasn't funny, you were entirely justified in leaving that situation. You are under no obligation to make yourself available for someone else to bully. NTA.", "My daughters are teenagers and they don't do that.\n\nHis daughter is an AH and ruined your relationship. That is his problem to deal with now.", "NTA. That girl needs to learn boundaries. I assume if you grabbed a pair of her panties and hung them outside for all of her school friends to see, she would be horrified, and it would be completely inappropriate. A prank is putting an elastic band on the kitchen sink sprayer so when you turn it on, you get a little wet. It\u2019s not a prank for her to take your panties and hang them for the whole family to see. She was out of line and needs to learn what is and isn\u2019t appropriate. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is gaslighting you and not setting boundaries with his daughter. Instead of profusely apologizing for her behavior and telling you that he will talk to her and not let it happen again, he took her side and made you out to be the bad guy when you were a victim of not only her bad behavior, but his enabling behavior. \n\nI\u2019d be thinking twice about creating a life with someone who chooses his daughters bad behavior over your dignity and boundaries.\n\nYou did not ruin the party, his daughter did. And it\u2019s incredibly unfair for the blame to be out on you. If his daughter wouldn\u2019t have done that, the birthday would have been fine. You reacted to someone completely humiliating in front of your future family. Of course you were upset.

What if she never stops these pranks?", "NTA. No, you didn't overreact. The fiance labeling your reaction as 'hypersensitivity' and claiming that you ruined his day is the AH.\n\n I'm going to give the 16YO child a pass, because she is a child, but if I were you, I'd do all the \"pranks\" that his child did to you, then dump him if he reacts negatively.", "I would think about if this is the life you want? She's 16 yes, but thats also old enough to know right from wrong. A prank should be funny, not hurtful. And it seems to me like she's trying to anything possible to ruin the relationship between you and her dad. You also need to understand that that is his daughter, so right or wrong he will always side with her. He proved this by letting you leave and not really doing anything to discipline her or let her know it's not okay what she did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is how your life is going to be. she will always be #1 and unfortunately that's something you have to either shut up and deal with or break up with him and find someone who wont have a daughter who treats you like this.", "NTA and is this the life you really see for yourself arguing about if something is a prank or or not I\u2019m sorry nothing about what she did says prank or funny and if he is not standing up for you now that will not change.

The reason he\u2019s saying you rounded his birthday is probably his family and friends (even those who laughed) now realize what a terrible parent he is. They\u2019re probably telling him how wrong what his daughter did was, and he thinks if he can get you to come over and apologize than it shows his daughter didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

Her intent was clearly to single out OP and embarrass her. Don't get me wrong, i know some kids mature later than others, especially those whose parents encourage or refuse to discipline rude behavior. But OP doesn't need to deal with that and should definitely consider moving on because it's clear the kid has it out for her and the fiance isn't interested in setting boundaries.", "These are not pranks. It\u2019s just plan mean. It is NOT NORMAL teenager behavior. She learned to be a bully from her dad. \n\nDo you want to live with 2 people who have no respect for others? \n\nNTA.", "In your apology you should tell the FSD that you are truly sorry that she is a spoiled, rude, selfish, hateful, undisciplined, bratty bully.", "NTA.  Your BF is supposed to have your back when you are attacked, prank or not.  You take center stage over his spoiled rude daughter, if he's serious about you.  Explain that to him instead of apologizing.  If you apologize, the kid will be even more spoiled and empowered.", "NTA. Are you sure he is mature enough to have a relationship with you? An adult would have handled the pranks by now and would not make the incident about him and his party.", "NTA-She's bullying you and he's allowing it. Doesn't sound like he'll have your back in this marriage. Think really hard about if this is the type of husband you want before walking down the aisle.", "I have a twisted sense of humor but I can read a room and I know that some places, some people, some times are inappropriate for joking around.  The nicest thing I can say here is that she can't read a room, but how does your fiancee not see that this was a step too far?\n\nYou didn't overreact.  But I would postpone the heck out of the wedding until there was some deep, soul searching conversations between you and him and you and them.  He needs to see your side too.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nDon't marry someone who doesn't care about your feelings. If with something like this he already wants you to swallow your feelings, imagine in the future? Don't do this to yourself. It is better to be \"supersensitive\" now and get rid of a bullet than to ignore your feelings and not recognize yourself in the future.", "NTA \n\nMichael\u2019s daughter has forgotten a key component of a prank or joke: it has to be funny. Humiliation is not funny. Disrespecting boundaries is not funny. She is not funny, she\u2019s spiteful. Your fianc\u00e9 should learn to reprimand his daughter for her cruel \u201cjokes\u201d. He needs to learn to be a parent and not a passive contributor to her bad behaviour. If he can\u2019t do that - leave. If he is unable to be a parent, he\u2019s more than likely unable to be a good husband. He\u2019s just proved he can\u2019t be a good fianc\u00e9, why do you think this will change when you live together? Or when you get married?", "NTA \u201cit was a prank\u201d \u201cit was a joke\u201d is code for let me manipulate you out of your feelings.  Your future SD is doing everything she can think of to sabotage your relationship with her father and it\u2019s working. They both owe you an apology. Until they see the error of their ways, I\u2019d stay clear.", "I wouldn't stay with him after this even if he had a golden dick. Woman, you haven't even started living with them yet. I can only imagine what she will do to you while living with her under the same roof. I wouldn't be surprised if she goes so far as to poison your food since she clearly despises you. They are both the same (toxic). He doesn't want to see who she is, it will always be your fault because she can do no wrong in his eyes. Drop him/them and consider this a bullet dodged.", "Run Run Run and then Run some more. You are getting a glimpse into your future. If you want that life bless it.", "Nta she humiliated you. That's not a prank.. I hate when people say they love pranks, but really they're just bullies. \n\nI would reconsider your engagement to a man that doesn't have any sympathy for you when you've been publicly humiliated", "NTA she\u2019s a teen, she may not be able to fully realize consequences when she makes a plan and does something, but she is fully old enough to deal with the consequences. You deserve better and I hope you dump this guy and fine fu", "Oh wow!  That\u2019s not a \u201cprank\u201d the pure out-and-out meanness.  There\u2019s NOTHING funny about it and I\u2019d go so far as to say it was plotted solely to get rid of you. \n\nYou ruined nothing, Miss Meany did the ruining.", "This was NOT a prank. And you\u2019re fianc\u00e9\u2019s reaction shows a gross lack of parenting. If someone did that to his daughter he\u2019d loose his shit. Same should be applied to you. Don\u2019t apologize. Don\u2019t go through wedding. Tell him good luck finding someone to be with when he has a rude spoiled brat.", "Not a prank. NTA.", "NTA. That\u2019s not a prank. She Doesn\u2019t want you there, and is resorting to cruel tactics and her father is allowing it. The hypersensitive remark seals it.", "Nah, break up with him to his face and tell him explicitly why. Ghosting is immature and I bet they turn it around on her.\n\nEDIT: Reread and realized they are engaged...don't ghost someone you considered marrying that's obscene.", "Thank you! I was so confused", "Ugh. You rich people. Can\u2019t we have one prank that doesn\u2019t involve caviar?!", "I read that reply and 100% agreed. On purpose to put op in her place and set future responses from dad.", "That last one is even better! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "NTA.  His daughter is showing you no respect and your fianc\u00e9 is disregarding your feelings by saying you over-reacted.  If that happened to me, I'd feel the same way and you have every right to be MAD AS HELL!  Public humiliation (friends and family count as an audience) is not a harmless prank, it is mean and shows that she has not learned empathy or respect for another human, let alone her father's chosen partner.  If she has a problem with your relationship then she needs to use words to express herself, not immature, insensitive pranks that could wreck her father's happiness.", "It was the \u2018you left these here last time\u2019 that struck me as slut shaming. It\u2019s to draw attention to her spending the night \u2014 and presumably sleeping with the fiance.", "My kids were about 10 and 12 when I left their father and it was just us 3 and their friends for the next 3 years. I spent most of my free time taking my kids to fun places and a lot of the times their friends too. My oldest was maybe 15 when I ran into an old school friend who was recently divorced also and we decided a weekly Friday girls night out would be our thing. We had so much fun. I still devoted the rest of the weekends to my kids but my daughter was upset that I was going out with a friend at all she said some very nasty hurtful things to me about it. I told her oh okay so I won't have any friends then it will just be you and me all the time. We will do EVERYTHING together. She said oh great and I'll call Lauren so she can...I cut her off right there. Oh no. No Lauren or Samantha or Kelsey. We aren't allowed to have friends remember. If I'm not allowed well it wouldn't be fair if you did now would it? It's just you and me remember no one else. She got quiet and thought about it and changed her tune. When kids have a parent all to themselves for so long it's got to be hard to share them with other people. But they have to learn, parents are people too and we crave friendships and relationships with people of our own age just as much as they do. But yes this girl is definitely doing this to chase OP away. And since dad won't put a stop to it, I'd be walking away as quickly as I could and find someone that would respect me and not let their child bully me.", "> OP should look at her with a deadpan look, a monotone voice, and have her explain how the prank is so \"funny\" Also if there are other people around and try to help her, say NO I asked her to explain it to me not you.\n\nThis is the one you really commit to. \"I'm trying to figure out the funny part. Is it the way the elastic is a little baggy here because my stomach isn't perfectly flat? How about the slight staining here on the crotch from period blood? Or is it the color of the panties? Do you think this makes my skin look sallow? Or is it the fact that I left them in your father's bed, where you presumably found them? Is that the funny part?\""]}
