Does the father of the child contribute?

You're already supporting her every which way you can. When you CANT anymore that's a boundary. Hold your boundaries.", "Oh no honey\u2026 you are going above and beyond.

There is subsidized child care available in many states/counties to allow women to work or attend educational programs. Nobody advertises it but it exists.

You know before getting pregnant that daycare is expensive, babysitters cost money, and people will not drop everything for the kid you chose to have. \"It takes a village\" is such a toxic idea. If the village chooses to be there, great, but you can't force the village to help you. Daycare prices are no secret, so don't act surprised after giving birth. \n\nYour daughter can already live with you, she needs to figure out the rest herself. I was a young mom so I will probably be a young grandmother myself, but I'll have the same boundaries - if my kid chooses to have kids, that's on him and his responsibility.

It's extremely hard to say no, especially in the face of your child crying.

Your daughter needs to understand that.", "NTA live your life.", "Exactly and this is what you should tell her OP. She would still have to pay even if he's not there or they'll give away her spot.

Will I stop being so accommodating?  Not likely.  We are our own worst enemies.  NTA.", "Definitely NTA, but you're not necessarily right about her losing the spot if she removes the kid from daycare. My wife lost her job recently and we couldn't afford to put our kids in daycare as a result without going into our savings. We're approaching the end of our savings and my wife is still looking for a job. We've talked to our daycare and they were willing to put both our kids at the top of the waitlist for their respective rooms and in both cases they know that kids are going to cycle out the following month and then our kids will take their place. Essentially, they are willing to allow us to drop out for a month and come right back. Starts had to align but it worked out.", "I had to chuckle a bit at that.  How is trying to guilt your mother into babysitting you gaining independence?  Of course she\u2019s just talking financial independence, but it\u2019s still a little funny.  \u201cHow can I be independent if you won\u2019t help me?\u201d", "This!!! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4d", "Grandparents are grandparents they aren't the parents.

She tripped and protected the kid and fell and ruined her back. Never was able to work again. Not her job or childcare.", "This is the most reasonably compassionate response. You took into account that OP loves her daughter just like we each love our children and it\u2019s more effective to offer advice that takes that into account. It\u2019s easier to give feedback that involves other parents because it doesn\u2019t involve our feelings or our kids so I love that you have so much empathy for OP. Good on you.", "Most people don't realize how expensive daycare actually is. Most of what she makes is probably going to pay for daycare. I just recently quit my job and became a SAHM because my entire paycheck went to paying for daycare. \n\nNot saying the mom needs to help daughter for that month. I think mom is NTA. But daughter probably is having a really hard time saving any money until the child is out of daycare.", "The daughters not in dire straits though.

She was only 20 when my oldest sister\u2019s father split.  This was 1949 and being a single mother was considered extremely wrong and she got judged pretty harshly.  My grandmother didn\u2019t babysit and although one of her aunts would babysit my mom definitely had to pay her.  My mom had to work a series of odd jobs and pay rent at her mom\u2019s house.  She really struggled until she met and married my dad.  A lot of men at that time wouldn\u2019t have even looked at a single mother but my dad really loved my sister and adopted her.

My second oldest sister had always been jealous of her and somehow found out that she had a different father,  She went to our sister and told her that she wasn\u2019t our dad\u2019s child and that she had been a mistake.  My dad was furious and confronted her by saying that he had chosen my oldest sister to be his child and the law and his love meant that she was his child.  Then he informed her that she had actually been the accident because my mom got pregnant with her before she and my dad were married.  Was it cruel to say that?
