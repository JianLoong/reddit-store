The daycare provider obviously can't afford to just hold the space open for her for a month without pay, they need to cover their own expenses.  \n\nHas she taken her husband to court for child support?  That needs to be done ASAP.  It will do more for her long-term finances supporting her child than loosing daycare to try to save one month's daycare cost.", "NTA\n\n>She started crying, saying that she was trying to gain independence and eventually move out, but that being a single mother was so hard and I wasn't making it any easier.\n\nPardon, if living rent free and providing intermediate childcare isn't making your daughter's life any easier, well, she doesn't know how hard being a single parent without any support really is for a lot of people.", "NTA. \n\nYour daughter should look into getting support from her ex and/or the government.", "NTA- you did the child raising, now its her turn to do it.  You can do what you want, you are not her free babysitter.", "Absolutely NTA. Is it great to have a family member available to help watch kids? Of course. But is the non-parent required to watch them? Absolutely not. My uncle is currently guilting my grandfather (who is elderly) to basically live at their house and be at his beck-and-call to watch my cousin whenever he needs him. My grandfather is allowed to have his own life and so are you. It is so frustrating when people do this.", "NTA: you deserve your time. You aren't taking vacation to benefit your daughter, you are taking it to recharge your batteries so you can keep helping your daughter.", "NTA \n\nAlso - if she plans on giving up her daycare spot that\u2019s the only way she would save money - most daycares still expect you to pay even if your child doesn\u2019t attend.  You pay for the spot - not just the child care", "NTA\n\nWhy should you give up your holidays to look after someone else\u2019s child. Yes, being a single mother is hard, but you\u2019re already doing a significant amount, and you ARE making it a lot easier for her already.", "NTA\n\nIf your daughter takes the child out of daycare she'll lose her spot. So this is not a good plan anyway.\n\nYou are giving your daughter and grandchild a place to live and childcare after you finish work. You are doing plenty. Your daughter should be grateful. You have a right to live your life and that includes getting a break. Take the time off, do things you love. Don't feel bad about not taking care of your grandchild.", "NTA - Definition of vacation: Is the vacating of work.  Just tell her, sorry but you are on vacation, so there is no work for you.  Your daughter can just continue with the standing agreement of her paying for childcare as your babysitting was not in the original agreement.  End of discussion.  Good for you for sticking to your guns.", "you're not making it any easier? is she for real???\n\nNTA", "Nta. It's a month, not months. It won't help her move out any sooner.  Don't feel bad.", "NTA sorry but your daughter sounds very entitled. I\u2019m sorry for her situation but she already is getting free living and partial child care. She sounds like a person who doesn\u2019t hear no a lot from you but probably needs to hear it more. You\u2019re not a baby mom. Your a grandma who already goes above and beyond.", "NTA. She can gain independence by paying her own way fully starting today if she doesn't appreciate all she's being given already.", "NTA, you absolutely deserve to take time off and be kind to yourself.", "NTA at all. You probably work very hard to provide for and support her and you deserve a break. Babysitting that much would be just like being at work so why even take time off. It\u2019s also very nice of you to offer in the mornings!", "NTA.  She shouldn't have assumed you were just going to be stepping in.  Yeah, it sucks, but that's life.  It's not fair being a single mom.  She's already got a LOT of help by living rent free.  AND you're watching the kid for two hours a day without pay anyway.  Gift horse, meet mouth.", "NTA. I'm a single mom. My parents helped when needed, but my son was in daycare. They would watch him if the daycare was closed or my son was sick. I made it work, all without child support or any help from the father who skipped the state. Now my son has a three month old. His wife has it in her mind that when the family offered to watch the baby when they needed help that she could go back to school and I would watch the baby full time. My son and I just kind of laughed. I'd have to quit my job. Lol. Well, I guess she thinks either me (52) or my almost 80-year-old parents will watch the baby. I'm still laughing at that one.", "NTA. You\u2019ve paid your dues in raising your daughter. Your grandson is just that, your grandson. Your daughter crying when she doesn\u2019t get her way is som serious manipulation tactics. You have your own life, and yes it sounds like you help out and pitch in when you can, but your daughter chose this life and to say being a single mom is hard is an understatement. Yes it sucks that her husband abandoned his family and that\u2019s on him. Millions and billions of women that are single moms are in a more dire situation than she is, at least she has her mom to help her. Do not feel bad about having your own life and wanting to take time off to do so. Your daughter is being unreasonable. \n\nNTA", "NTA, first she needs to go after daddy for child support. Second, she needs to go see what programs she qualifies for.  You are on the back side of middle age.  You are taking time off to rest, not take care of an active toddler for extended hours.  Stay strong on this.  I would advise that know what time she has to leave for work and go to the gym about an hour before it.  Take your time in your workout and take your time in going home.  With her attitude I would not put it past her just going to work and leaving her child with you unannounced.", "NTA. You\u2019re taking a month off to rest not take care of a child! Hell, work is my rest from my home life. Being home with the kids is a lot of work in and of itself. Your daughter needs to start respecting your time and be grateful that you are doing as much as you already are for her.", "NTA. First time grandma myself and I was so surprised at how exhausting it really is this time around! I also work out and consider myself reasonably fit, but taking care of a toddler uses different muscles, is a lot of lifting etc. My question to your daughter would be, do you want your child looked after by someone who simply isn\u2019t physically up to the task for that many hours? Frankly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the safest plan for either of you. One tumble could be a big deal. Maybe if you point out that its not that you don\u2019t want to help more, you are just at your limit, she might understand that you just want wants best for the three of you.", "NTA\nUsually one can\u2019t pull their child out of daycare for a month without losing their spot, so that\u2019s odd your daughter would even be able to do that. \nAs a Grandmother and daily care provider to a 3 year old, it is HARD work! You have an absolute right to draw this boundary. Your daughter will be alright and your grandson will benefit by having consistency in his usual afternoon routine.", "You raised your children. She needs to raise her own.", "NTA. I feel you on this one.", "NTA.  You are doing what you can to help and she doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate it.  You have a right to your own life too. You don\u2019t OWE her anything at all.", "NTA- I also have a daughter who\u2019s a single mom who has 2 kids and lives with us rent free.\nShe knows and understand her dad and I are not just free, round the clock babysitters. If she needs us to watch them every now and them we absolutely agree but she knows I prefer to not be a full time sitter.", "NTA. Your time off isn't your daughter's to fill babysitting. She has a child and needs to pay for daycare; she's ignoring your need to rest.", "You're 56, do it while you can.

The help your daughter actually needs is to get court ordered child support payments from the deadbeat sperm inserter.

If she is already saving money because you're letting her live, essentially bill free, then she will eventually find that independence.

And the amount of money that she would save for one month is not enough to make a real difference in her financial ability to move out.", "100% we had a family that kept their kid in daycare even though family could cover for the summer because the risk of losing the spot was too high.", "have her email me. i'll give her the lowdown on the realities of single parenthood without support. :)", "So much this. I was very fortunate that my dad and stepmother let me move in when I was almost due and I stayed until my son was six months old.  They made it clear from the get-go that they were not live-in babysitters and wanted to only care for the baby on their terms, to which I agreed.\n\nThe 'help' they gave me was in other ways - I had a hot meal on the table every night, taking him so I could shower every day and in those times I was at the end of my rope they were there. They didn't charge me rent. I didn't have to worry about bills except for expenses in keeping my son clothed and fed. I was always grateful but never more so that when I went out on my own and realised all those small things added up to be so very much.\n\nI had to go back to work part-time when my son was three months old for financial reasons and paid for daycare myself. I would never have expected my parents to step in, especially as they were still working. There was the odd day when they'd have the day off and offer to take him and not have him sent to daycare, but they were rare as they needed and deserved their time off too.\n\nSingle parenthood is hard, not gonna lie. But that doesn't mean you as the grandparent should be guilted into helping when you are already doing so much.", "Yes, THIS! I know it's a difficult economy, but you are already providing SO much help and support! My Mom offered to and did keep my twins when I went back to work and it nearly killed her. I wish I had never accepted her offer or at least only accepted it part-time because it wore her down! I DID pay her, but the trade-off wasn't worth it looking back. Stay strong Mama, you're head is in the right space, be firm!", "Why should they?", "Ditto. I got none of what she is getting.   I had to cry on the phone one day to a relative for help.  I had pneumonia and couldn't get out of bed.  With a 3 yr old. I got 3/4 of a day help."]}
