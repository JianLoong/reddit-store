On a side note, that sounds seriously awful lol. I wouldn't ever want to stay at my CEO's home much less with a dozen other couples, this is WEIRD AF. Like you are saying you *won a trip to go to work?* Why would you even want this? Can you get out of it?", "NTA! \nIs he using his own money to pay for his kids flights and hotels?! Because I don\u2019t care how much he agreed to do that, I would not be paying for any adult kids to join my vacation!!", "NTA. You didn\u2019t say the kids were coming, so why on earth would he call them to tell you they were coming?!", "NTA.  Why does your husband always want to invite his adult kids to accompany the two of you on vacation?  Do they give him grief if you go away on vacation without them,.or is your husband just weird?", "YTA, you get upset too fast. If you don't want the kids to come, just say so. I know you don't want to come off as the bad guy by telling the kids that can't come, you want their dad to do that. But, most parents will default to bringing their kids on vacation with them.", "Yeah, I couldn't get past that either.", "He did invite his kids without asking me first. He assumed any trip I won would automatically mean we would pay for the kids to come with us.\nIt was only after I told him one night would be at the CEO's home that he decided...on his own... that it wouldn't  be appropriate to bring the kids.\nHe said if I had won one of the other trips he would still have insisted one bringing the kids.", "That's a terrible assumption on his part.", "I did tell him I wanted it to be just us the first opportunity I had.

Your \"work trip\" doesn't sound like it would be much fun for your husband, who doesn't work at your company.  It's really your stuff, visiting your CEO, your company's facilities, hanging with your coworkers.  For an outsider that's really a lot of time with your workmates and it's understandable if that's not how he wants to spend his valuable vacation time.  He's not wrong for wanting to save the time for his kids instead of your coworkers.", "NTA", "I read the edits. I still do not understand the whole CEO house sleepover thing. But anyways, NTA. An expenditure that large should be discussed together.", "NTA the kids are grown. Even if you planned the trip, if he invited them without asking you first and it would still be messed up.", "YTA. You were talking about a vacation, your husband thought it would be nice to make it a family thing. Pretty understandable. As soon as he found out he had misunderstood the situation he backed off of it.\n\nYes, he should've discussed it with you first. But it was a relatively reasonable plan on his part, and again, as soon as he found out you weren't on board with the plan, he dropped it. He's not a mind reader.", "He needs to either discuss things with his wife before kids to gauge her wishes and stop making universal decisions alone, like he\u2019s the Boss.

That will tell you where you fit in his life?", "Most parents will default to bringing their adult children with them on vacation?  In what universe?", ">He said if I had won one of the other trips he would still have insisted one bringing the kids\n\nHow long have you been married?   Why does he get to \"insist\" on bringing his kids to anything, let alone an event organized by *your* employer.    TBH, this hints at something more than your annoyance about this particular situation.   What's the background here?", "NTA...but it sounds like next time you should just take someone else as a +1 and tell your husband it's a work thing.", "NTA\nsorry I'm going to focus on the trip too.  This is such a weird concept to me.  So while you are at the ceos house and other work type things, are you being paid?  Do you have to use your annual holiday time for this?  Is the lotto a compulsory thing?  Sounds like a friggin nightmare.", "**NTA.**\n\nThings like this are things every couple should be discussing beforehand, together. Especially when he's offering to pay for what will undoubtedly wind up to be an extortionate amount of money without consulting you first. Maybe sitting down with your partner and re-hashing the new expectations now your children are grown and flown would be a good idea.", "NTA!! He should always ask you if you want to include the family, or if it\u2019s a parents only trip. But you\u2019d have to explain that to him.", "NTA. This is the sort of thing that you decide together. He basically just *told* you what you were doing and expected you to just roll with it. Not cool.", "i disagree, husband didn\u2019t know what the vacation was going to possibly be. Imagine OP won the tropical vacation, you know how much it would cost to send 3 additional people on a 7 day tropical vacation? probably thousands of dollars.

This guy is giving me the hinks.", "Yeah, but there won't be any actual work happening. They won't be in meetings or training all day, or even team building exercises like you'd expect a work retreat to have.", "NTA if he tries to bring the kids then say that your taking your best friend instead its time you had a kid free vacation you don't need him op stand up for yourself your whole life shouldn't be about his step kids and it sounds like he can't go anywhere without them!", "NTA - Obscure reference but this reminds me of an American Dad episode where Stan is afraid to spend alone time with his wife, Francine cause he's terrified she's gonna leave him \"cause he's boring\"\n\nIdk why your husband wanted the kids to come along so badly.", "NTA\n\nIf you don't want the kids there, make him walk the invite back and arrange something else in 6-8 months.\n\nI understand he still wants to go on family holidays but this is neither the time nor the trip.\n\nETA: And have a conversation about him making decisions without running it by you.", "NTA\n\nHusband was wrong. Very wrong to invite his kids on your work trip.\n\nThis was only a plus 1 so if HE is going to invite them HE should also be shouldering the entire expense.\n\nAsk him WHY he would invite his children without talking to you. Why he assumes that you would be okay with that. Why it could not be just you two.", "NTA\n\nTell him it's good that you know now that even the tropical trips would include his adult children. Now if you win one next time, you know to take a friend instead since the idea of a romantic couples getaway is nowhere near top of his mind.", "You sound like an asshole.", "This probably stems from the divorce? Their mother and her boyfriend went on trips once or twice a year and always without the children when they were little.\nThat might be why we took them on so many vacations when they were younger. The last one when the oldest was still a teenager.", "Yes, it is not \"him\" offering to pay, it is \"us\" from our joint account.\nAlso, I make significantly more money than him so your comment does have validity.", "Lol read the edit. And honestly some company HQs are wicked cool. Like they have museums or really cool tech or something in them. There's this one in Japan that has an active farm in it. Animals, aquaponics, the whole shebang. In a high rise in the middle of Tokyo. If OPs HQ is one of those you bet I'd want a tour of it too!", "I am a salaried employee, so yes I will be paid, no I will not have to use vacation time to go on this trip.

Maybe OP\u2019s company is in that situation. My company could send us on a trip to Paris and they had to pay a tax on it, because the relevant tax law perceived it as a perk. They could send us to a \u201cmeeting\u201d in Paris and it was all work, no tax. The work stuff on one day of seven is probably to avoid taxes.", "So don\u2019t go.
