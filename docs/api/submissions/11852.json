You\u2019ve come about it in a fairly non-traditional way, but that doesn\u2019t change that it is the way you learned to pronounce English words.", "NTA; you speak two languages more than I do, and probably more than that \"alpha\" male over there. Don't sweat it.", "Obviously NTA and if anything, this \"You should have your country's most stereotypical English accent or otherwise it's appropriating\" is somewhat insulting. \n\nThis is the second AITA I have seen where this is asked (\"Is accent appropriating?\" and I am kinda worried: are there actually multiple ppl who think like this?", "NTA\n\nI can understand the dissapointment the guy felt after thinking he finally encountered someone from \u201dhome\u201d, but you are in no way appropriating anything by speaking english the way you were taught. \n\nNow, if you were doing it to mock the Australian accent, that\u2019d be a whole other thing. \n\nListen to your BF and just ignore the random dude.", "NTA A drunk guy put his hand on you  in a bar and wanted to start an argument because bud was mistaken about you and embarrassed.

They sound like their teachers, too.", "NTA.", "NTA, you learned their language and picked up their accent, nothing wrong with that", "Oh ffs NTA! This appropriating shit is getting out of hand. You are not using something from another culture to get rich while claiming you discovered it or came up with it. You learned to speak a certain way. This is your THIRD language?! Speak it however tf you want! And if you learned it with Australian accent, then it makes sense you\u2019ll speak it with Australian accent. Not to mention Australians aren\u2019t typically seen as a marginalized group.", "Woooooooo. NTA. \n\nI am Australian.

You are just speaking English the way you were taught it, and if you weren't speaking it with an Australian accent, you would have to \"appropriate\" an American accent or an English accent.", "NTA. There's no \"both sides.\" Don't even entertain this AH's argument. Asking you to fake a different accent would actually make you guilty of the thing he's accusing you off.  Every language has an accent depending on where and how you learned it. There's no such thing as \"neutral\" anything.", "NTA.  It\u2019s perfectly normal to pick up the accent of your teacher.  Someone with a good ear for language may even end up with a more specific regional accent.  If you deliberately picked up a specific accent, that might be a bit weird, and could be inappropriate especially if you picked up a dialect like AAVE, but you just learned what you were taught.  That\u2019d be like a Spanish person getting grumpy that I speak Mexican Spanish and not Castilian Spanish - I learned the dialect I was taught, and I live in California, so most of my local Spanish speakers aren\u2019t from Spain.", "English is your *third* language, and you learned from an Australian teacher.

You are NTA but he definitely is.", "NTA - that guy was an idiot. Anyone who learns a language is likely to speak with the accent of the person they learned from. I'm English and my French teacher was from Cote d'Ivoire, so I ended up with a mangled pseudo-Ivorian accent when speaking French. I don't anymore because I picked up French again years after school and learned a broader accent, but it was an odd combination to hear when I was younger.\n\nI know a Greek woman with an Italian husband and they live in England. You should hear the weird accents their children speak with at times.\n\nUnless you are intentionally trying to affect an accent you're fine. It's just the version of English that you know and that's perfectly ok.", "NTA\n\nNext time, ask them how their accent in your language is.

Most Dutch people I've met learned English from British people, and usually speak English with an English accent. That hardly means they're appropriating it.\n\nI learned French from people from Quebec, so learned to speak it with a Quebecois accent vs a France-French accent. It wouldn't matter if i was taught by someone from France and had a \"proper\" francophone accent; either way, it's not appropriation. \n\nThe random Australian at the bar was probably excited at the prospect of meeting someone from back home (very typical traveller behavior) and took out his disappointment on you, which kinda makes him the AH.", "NTA.

The guy\u2019s reaction is stupid! Accents are not \u201cowned\u201d by their people. It is extremely normal! I am not a native english speaker myself, and in my country people adapt to whatever accent their teachers have. The usual response we get from people with the native accent is \u201chey! Your accent is good, you are like one of us!\u201d. Of course I have never received this compliment myself, given how bad my english is lol!\n\nDon\u2019t worry about it. It was just one of those weird daily encounters that are better left alone.", "NTA\nWhat a weird guy! Also, there isn't such a thing as 'no accent'. Even what we commonly call 'British English' is a specific kind of accent. \nSpeaking three languages is amazing, good job!", "NTA, just ignore it.

End of story.", "NTA that guy was a moron.  You are not culturally appropriating anything. Anyone you learn a new language from will impart their own accent on you. Are you only allowed to learn a new language from someone who speaks your own native language?  Of course not. His argument is ridiculous.", "Speaking as an Australian, NTA.\nWe learn the accents when we learn a language. A lot of Malaysian people speak English with a bit of an American accent and a lot of Indian people speak it with a bit of a British accent. It's to do with how we learn to pronounce the words. It's nobody's fault.", "NTA. This is ludicrous. There are no two sides to this OP. What English accent are you \u201callowed\u201d to have?  American? Scottish? Or Just a thick Nordic accent?", "You talk how you talk, WTF do these people expect you to do?

He would probably give someone born from two ex-pat Aussies shit for speaking with an accent for learning it from their parents.", "NTA - You're speaking English with a particular accent because that's how you learnt it, just as someone from the US speaks English with a particular US accent because that's how they learnt it, someone from England speaks English with a particular English accent because that's how they learnt it, and that Australian guy speaks English with a particular Australian accent because that's how he learnt it.

That's how language learning works.", "NTA \n\nMy Portuguese friend learnt English with an American accent and now lives in the UK.

How are you supposed to speak it \"without an accent\" ?!?!", "NTA \n\nI have two friends who live in Ireland, both Polish who speak English with a strong West Cork accent. They've got a stronger accent than I do, and I was born and raised there. What's happened to your accent is very normal. Ignore the dude, you're fine. Anyway, what accent would you adopt?

LOL at the idea that using an Australian accent is \"appropriation\". Ridiculous. You learned English from an Australian, totally fine to speak it the way you learned it.

Not appropriation to use this accent.", "NTA\n\nIm autistic and my accent is picked up by tv shows and actors and such so the way i talk is not associated with any nation. People constantly ask where im from. I get canada a lot. You didn't fake an accent, you just were taught by someone with a regional accent, that's not faking. Thats not appropriation either.

I\u2019d find it a mildly amusing story at worst. Besides, if accidentally taking on an Aussie accent is appropriation does that mean all the children that sound English from watching too much Peppa Pig are appropriating? Or Aussie actors doing American accents? To be able to speak a language so fluently that you sound like a native speaker should be a credit to OP, not a detriment", "Don\u2019t you understand, anyone who speaks English exactly like me doesn\u2019t have an accent, and everyone who speaks differently has an accent. /s", "I seem to see a lot of Chinese people in videos and such that have a British accent.  It's how they learned English, I assume.  An Egyptian archeologist comes to mind that has what sounds like a British accent.\n\nWhat a ridiculous thing to gatekeep about."]}
