The one that has to take things into civil court to change things is ex's pops.  Nice try though.", "So, OP has the title. Are you saying that she reports her motor vehicle stolen. The cops won\u2019t look for it and impound it when they find it? Now, say when she made the report of a stolen vehicle.

If anything tell the dad to take the engine back apart or give you a REASONABLE price but since he originally did the work on YOUR truck for FREE you don't have any obligations to him.", "He worked on a truck that was in her name for free. She bought all the tools and parts and has the receipts. He agreed to do the work for free because she intended to give the truck to his son but the circumstances changed to no fault of hers.

This was a quasi contracts that was created by performance. The labor and assistance the father provided was done in exchange for the promise of it being a wedding gift for the son . Legally - this actually does create an enforceable agreement. Op essentially induced free labor in exchange for the promise that the finished product go to Jason. Think of this example : I tell you I\u2019ll give you $500 to cross the Brooklyn bridge naked. Once you strip and take your first step I can\u2019t say you can only collect it by flying to Nepal and picking it up there or I\u2019ll give you an item worth 500 bucks instead. You\u2019ve begun performing I have to follow through on my end or you are entitled to some form of remedy.\n\nHere the father did a significant amount of labor and legwork even though op purchased the overall vehicle and its parts. One of two things can happen now: either the father can actually collect for the fair market value  of the labor / work he did on the item OR he can seek the increase in value (or the benefit op is now enjoying) that resulted due to his labor. Alternatively op could walk away but ask him to reimburse her for actual costs incurred and I guess the cost of the pain and reupholstery. Either way would make the parties \u201cwhole\u201d so to speak but op is the one that actually changed the terms here not Jeremy\u2019s father.\n\nJeremy is actually the biggest Ah of all and op and his dad should both amicably resolve things because Jeremy and his ah behavior and lies are the root of both their problems", "OP changes the terms when she said the car was no longer going to the son.

Full stop. You don\u2019t get to de facto change the agreement. I am almost certain a judge will agree with OP, assuming she has the receipts for all the parts and tools she purchased as well as some written texts or emails about the free labor.

If he doesn't want to buy it for his son then you should come to some agreement about how much to pay him for his time. If you can sell the truck for much more than you put into it then, in fairness, you should pay him for his time. You cannot be unjustly enriched by the end of your relationship.  If you can't sell the truck for enough to cover everything then you get your money back from the proceeds and the rest goes to Jeremy's dad.", "NAH he was providing the free labour as a wedding gift for his son.\n\nYou both need to agree to sell the truck and each recoup your expenses.  Otherwise you will need to take it to small claims court.", "How about you ask him to pay you back instead for the truck?", "This is a slippery slope. I understand the father's position, as he was donating his time as a gift to his son. If the truck is no longer going to his son, I can understand why he would want to receive *some* compensation. However, there was no prior agreement, so legally, you may not be held responsible for the cost. \n\nIs there anyone who could take a look at the bill he sent you and determine is the amount is reasonable?
