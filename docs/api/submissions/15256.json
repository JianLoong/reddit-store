It's also possible that he wanted you to bring in your regular meals PLUS the desserts. \n\nI've mentioned before how sad it is that the people who do volunteer and help are the ones criticized for not helping more. \n\nNext time someone criticizes you for not bringing desserts, ask them what they brought last time and if they could just bring more.

Why does it HAVE to be desert? Are you and Jay the only people in this organization? Someone else easily could\u2019ve done it, in fact if it\u2019s so simple Jay could handle it himself!

I do know that sometimes volunteers are given guidelines on what to make due to the ability for the food to be reheated/distributed.  OP\u2019s example of bringing in a pie rather than cookies or brownies is a good example\u2026.how many people does a pie serve as opposed to cookies/brownies?  Also, cookies/brownies can be put in a brown paper bag lunch.  That said, if Jay did ban you from the organization and other people are siding with him, then they may all want to take a step back and reevaluate why they are doing this.  Because it seems like a meal, any meal, with or without dessert, should be accepted with open arms.  I also know some of the leaders of these orgs do it for acclaim rather than altruism\u2026.what\u2019s Taylor Swift call it\u2026.narcissistic altruism.  Either way, NTA.  Find another org and offer your help but remember to follow the guidelines for donations.", "NTA, definitely NTA.\n\nI'm pretty sure that people without homes or jobs would much rather have a filling meal than a no nutrition dessert to eat. Besides, I don't see where you say that the organization is fronting you the cash for anything that you're choosing to bring.\n\nJay is an AH and so are the people piling on with him.
