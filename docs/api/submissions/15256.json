It's also possible that he wanted you to bring in your regular meals PLUS the desserts. \n\nI've mentioned before how sad it is that the people who do volunteer and help are the ones criticized for not helping more. \n\nNext time someone criticizes you for not bringing desserts, ask them what they brought last time and if they could just bring more.

Why does it HAVE to be desert? Are you and Jay the only people in this organization? Someone else easily could\u2019ve done it, in fact if it\u2019s so simple Jay could handle it himself!

Volunteering in any useful way is making a huge difference in their lives. You should feel very proud that you\u2019re willing to not only give your time but your money too. Who is paying for the ingredients? You are. You\u2019re willing to do more than just to give your time!", "NTA Jay sounds ungrateful", "As a former volunteer coordinator for a non profit that works with the homeless, I have a hard time believing we are getting the entire story.  I do know that sometimes volunteers are given guidelines on what to make due to the ability for the food to be reheated/distributed.  OP\u2019s example of bringing in a pie rather than cookies or brownies is a good example\u2026.how many people does a pie serve as opposed to cookies/brownies?  Also, cookies/brownies can be put in a brown paper bag lunch.  That said, if Jay did ban you from the organization and other people are siding with him, then they may all want to take a step back and reevaluate why they are doing this.  Because it seems like a meal, any meal, with or without dessert, should be accepted with open arms.  I also know some of the leaders of these orgs do it for acclaim rather than altruism\u2026.what\u2019s Taylor Swift call it\u2026.narcissistic altruism.  Either way, NTA.  Find another org and offer your help but remember to follow the guidelines for donations.", "NTA, definitely NTA.\n\nI'm pretty sure that people without homes or jobs would much rather have a filling meal than a no nutrition dessert to eat. Besides, I don't see where you say that the organization is fronting you the cash for anything that you're choosing to bring.\n\nJay is an AH and so are the people piling on with him. If they are all bring desserts, why do you need to?", "NTA, if your donating food then there isn't an issue. This really falls under Ask Legal as Jay may be opening himself up to some legal ramifications.", "I will never understand volunteer bullies. It is literally the strangest thing. \n\nSeriously, please find another org where your time is better spent and where volunteers behave like\u2026. VOLUNTEERS. Basic criteria is helpful and selfless.

I think you should reach out to find out what he told them and to get your side of it out there.", "Marie Antoinette comes to mind, lol. She didn't finish well.", "Jay wanted desserts for himself. He was also testing you to see how far he could push you to do what he demands.  Thinking Jay had plans for you that required you to be submissive to his every whim.  Breaking down your opinion that you have choice; that your gifts are gifts, and that you get to decide how much of your time, money, and effort should be donated would be necessary to erase if he intended to have all the control.  The dessert issue was a trial balloon which is why you not obeying him or jumping through hoops for him got you fired.  \n\nMakes no sense otherwise that he would see you walk out the door because you didn\u2019t make cookies and he was outraged about it.  Your family pressure is that other clue.  Your independence is under attack here.  \n\n\nSo is Jay looking for a wife or mistress?  Is Jay one of those do gooders planning on becoming a cult leader?  \nIs Jay a religious leader?", "This is hilarious!  Someone who ran the charity chewed you out for bringing real food instead of desserts?  Wow...  I think you're better off having nothing to do with this charity, there are too many great ones out there who will appreciate anything you do for them.  Volunteerism is way way down in my state and this is a perfect example of why.  Definitely NTAH.", "NTA, it sounds like Jay had a hankering for brownies and tried to make it your problem!\n\n No way homeless people would prefer desserts over real food, that\u2019s insane.", "NTA. What an awful organization though. I highly doubt the people you are helping feed the same way or will be very pleased to see you go.\n\nGo volunteer somewhere that you\u2019ll be appreciated. Please don\u2019t let them deter you from doing this to help others if you enjoy it.", "Omg what an asshole.  This is 100% not about you.  I bet Jay was planning on repurchasing the dessert. \n\nThis guy is a bully and his reaction was way out of line.", "What the fuck did I just read. Please put that organization on blast, because they need to be shut down and replaced with one that cares about people and not it's image. NTA, and man fuck all those people.", "NTA\n\nWhat the actual ef!?\n\nYou were contributing your time, money and real food to those who needed it. \n\nWould it be awesome for them to get desserts? Absolutely. But, that is a WANT not a need.\n\nJay is a greedy AH looking a gift horse in the mouth. He should have been grateful for the contributions you were making and looked to someone else for desserts as you had meals covered.", "Yeah OP Jay is a tyrant. He should be happy you're volunteering your time and providing home-cooked savory dishes. There is no legitimate need to force you to do something you find unpleasant just because he wants to get his way. The guy needs to be cut out of the organization, otherwise he's gonna rot things from within.", "I work with volunteers and community groups - 95% of them are great people but there are a handful of AHs who love to use it to feel superior and enjoy a power trip. NTA - you won't be the only person Jay has pissed off so I'd watch to see if he lasts long in the organisation.", "If it's so important to have desserts, why isn't *he* making them?", "Came to say exact same thing. U give your time and food u make for free what an entitled areshole Jay is. He'd rather deprive the homeless and jobless of the food u take willingly because u made a hot nutritional meal instead of dessert. If he's that bothered about serving pudding to the needy maybe he could do it his fecking self instead of losing a willing volunteer. Talk about cutting ya nose off to spite ya face.", ">because u made a hot nutritional meal instead of dessert\n\nYeah it's so weird that Jay wants dessert of all things. When you're starving and haven't eaten in a long time, you don't exactly want to fill up on sweets and spike your blood sugar.\n\nHe probably just wants to eat it himself and isn't even thinking about the clients.", "This. I also think Jay wanted to swipe some of the desserts for himself. You can't take a piece of casserole without it being obvious, but you can cut up and replate brownies to hide theft.\n\nNTA Jay sucks. A hot dinner is much more important and helpful than desserts."]}
