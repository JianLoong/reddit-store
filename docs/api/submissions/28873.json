Usually I'd answer the other way but in a situation like this where he's basically put himself in control of you, that kind of behaviour is doubleplusungood.\n\nBe happy to be taken care of?

Best of luck - you will need it.", "NTA - that\u2019s weird. \nI\u2019m a SAHM and have access to everything and he lets me know when he moves any money anywhere.", "NTA I'm a stay at home mom.

If something happens to him, this is information you need to know. In fact, this sounds kind of like financial abuse.\n\nAs a SAHM, I'd be very worried about a \"don't worry your pretty little head, I'll take care of you with my money\" approach.

Everyone else is saying this is either abusive, sketchy, or both. \n\nBelieve them.", "NTA. You're not \"being taken care of,\" you are taking care of (both of) your child and house. You two are married, and there is no reason he should be hiding his financial situation from you. \n\nConsider, for instance, how you two might start a savings account for your infant's potential future college expenses.", "He's TA, not you.

You absolutely should be aware of finances. While I hope this is not the case of financial abuse, I would have a stash on a personal bank account for emergency.

Presumably your husband pays taxes and there should be a joint return.  You will have to sign this return.  Refuse to do so until you get a copy of it and have the opportunity to read it thoroughly.  If it's confusing, take it to an accountant and get it explained to you.\n\nIf there are businesses that aren't included in that tax document, refuse to sign until you see those docs as well.\n\nIt's very said that you have to engage in this sort of thing, but put simply, two can play at this game.

We were going to have a joint account and seperate personal accounts. So I was ok with more general info. However, after the birth of the baby, child are feel through, day care would cost more than 1/2 my salary.
