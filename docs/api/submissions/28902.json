My folks pointed out that the guy being naked in his own yard didn't hurt anyone. \n\nHim shooting squirrels with a BB gun, on the other hand could have ended badly...

Truly a style icon. \nAs a kid, I would see him out by his garage, and would talk his ear off. Other people were weirded out by a kid talking to a skinny man who was bronze as heck and wearing short shorts, but dude was harmless. He either tuned me out or my chatter was good background for doing car maintainence. \n\nHe may be different, but he's not only a decent neighbor...he is a standup guy. When our very old cat passed in her sleep, under a tree on his yard, he retrieved her and put her in a box for my folks or buried her, so she would not be discovered by curious little kids.
