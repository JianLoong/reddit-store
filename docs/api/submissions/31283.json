I moved almost 200 miles from my mom which is almost a 4 hour drive. \n\nMy mom gave me a hard time about it because her older kids aka my siblings don\u2019t even talk to her anymore due to situations she put them through and over all basically how she acts as a \u201cmother\u201d. Keep in mind she uses her kids to get money from the state. She recently got fired from a work place she was working at for quite a long time. And just got hired from the state to \u201ctake care\u201d of my older disabled sister but she literally doesn\u2019t she makes my little sister  do the all the caring for and the work. \n\nMy situation was to get on to my own two feet and become an adult because I knew if I stay there then I wouldn\u2019t grow to become the person I want to be. Mom has never taught me to drive or attempted to help me learn about getting a job or learn about finances. She was never involved with me. \nMom always stated \u201cI put a roof over your head\u201d which was true but it was never a step up to show a motherly role at all.  Our father has never been in our lives. He left her a long time ago and stopped him from being a father even when he did try. Anyway\n\nI moved into my older sister house who\u2019s 12 years older then me as well as her husband and and with my neicees and nephew. I have currently been with them and they are helping me out to become an adult.\n\nI recently got hired at a work place that pays good, and I felt like telling my mom about it but she mentioned if i plan on living in the area I\u2019m at permanently not welcomed back to live with her in the future. And honestly to my mind I want to but I don\u2019t know how to let her know because I know she will give me a harder time about it. She always had it in her mind that I am coming back to live with her. But I feel like she only wants me there to help with rent and be the person there to help when something goes wrong. Granted I do miss my baby sisters including my disabled sister but I just can\u2019t come back because I want to be a role model for them when they are ready to leave and become adults themselves. They should have sense of feeling to know it\u2019s okay to move on and grow up without having to look back.
