{"id": 34121, "submission_id": "18whjp0", "title": "AITA: Future MIL edition", "selftext": "AITA? My future mother-in-law already does not like me and wants nothing to do with me, we haven't even met!\n\nA little about me first: I'm JC (23 Y/O, F). I work in the financial industry. I am very family oriented, and don't really do much.\n\nMy mother-in-law, we will call her, T (49y/o) thinks everything I say is disrespectful as I am a younger. \n\nShe has called me a big baby, a smart ass, and a know it all. She doesn't even know me! \n\nA few days ago she had a small heart attack after a conversation her and my fiancee, J, (Female, 26Y/O) had. I feel bad for her, no one deserves to go through that. 2 days later she comes around and starts blaming me and saying I need to stop or I will end up k!||!ing her. \n\nThe conversation consisted of many things including T saying she is not allowed to see her grandkids, or her daughter, or send her grandbabies anything for Christmas. We did not provide our new address as we just moved and do not want any surprise visits as it is not a good time as we are still unpacking and I am studying for licenses. J kept saying she did not know our address, finally she decided to tell her mother the truth as to why. I helped J phrase the message as she did not know how to word it without it coming off harsh. She explained we do not want to give our address to anyone as we did not want any surprise visitors because it's not a good time. All J was doing was trying to set some boundaries as T was calling her \"weird and strange\" for mentioning to her mother that I am not fond of hugs as she remembers T being a hugger. \n\nT has degraded me when J told T we would not welcome T  in our home for a whole week because 1) we wouldn't have enough room, 2) my roommate, M, (27, M) and myself did not want T here because of the type of person she is; she is rude, judgmental, abusive, controlling, crazy, and dramatic (all words used by J). We do not want our kids exposed to this, nor do I personally want to deal with it. \n\nShe is constantly bashing me and saying she wants nothing to do with me because I have \"changed\" her daughter, I have \"changed\" their relationship. I voice my own opinion when I don't like something, or like how I am being treated. I was willing to welcome her into our home and get to know T, but now, that's out the window after all the disrespect she has shown me, by calling me names and blaming me for her heart attack.
