You figured it out before paying her, and that's what she's angry about.", "NTA.\n\n> she said that our dog was our problem\n\nCool tell her that her reservation is her problem.", "NTA, as you asked and made it clear the answer would determine your involvement, and she chose to mislead you.\n\nJust a side note: we hire a pet sitter to come to our house as our pets weren\u2019t great with the stress of boarding. It can certainly get pricey with the number of visits a dog would require a day, so just a suggestion if you were really wanting to go.", "NTA.  I mostly think people are unreasonable to feel the need to take their dogs everywhere, but you specifically asked about this multiple times and she lied to you.  NTA in any way.", "NTA and what was your sister thinking? That if you just showed up with your dog the guy was going to give in? The reservation money is now a her problem since she decided that somehow she would get her way, so her entitlement isn't really working out.", "NTA, but your sister is.\n\nYour sister screwed up, so your sister pays.\n\nI don't know if she screwed up on purpose because she disapproves of you wanting to bring your dogs along. If so then she's an asshole.\n\nIf she was just careless, then that doesn't rise to the level of being an asshole.

Sister explicitly said dogs were allowed, and when confronted with evidence to the contrary, she doubled down on trying to get away with it.
