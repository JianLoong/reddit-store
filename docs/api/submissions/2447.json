We got engaged about a year ago and when I got engaged my mother gave me a pair of earrings which she said every woman for generations in our family has worn to their weddings. They are 4.00ct dangling earrings and they are worth a lot. I felt very honoured to be given them and it made me feel closer to my grandmother who had died 2 months prior. \n\nAbout 3 months after that I went wedding dress shopping with my mother my sister and my fianc\u00e9s mother. I brought all the jewellery that I would be wearing to my wedding to see how they match the dresses. When I put the jewellery on my mother in law kept going on about how gorgeous the earrings were. My mother explained the story and how they were a family heirloom passed down generations. I found the dress of my dreams and bought it.\n\nOn the day of my wedding i had everything ready in my room. My wedding dress, my flowers, my shoes, my makeup and my jewellery. I was in there with my soon to be mother in law. I then needed to go to the toilet and when I came back my mother in law was gone. I wasn\u2019t sure what had happened but i just thought she maybe got called away to do something. I then noticed my earrings were gone. I knew straight away that she had taken them. \n\nI found her and confronted her and she said she didn\u2019t take them. I asked if I could look through her bag and she said no and gripped onto it. I said that if she didn\u2019t let me look I would call the police which I then did as she still wouldn\u2019t let me look. The police arrived and searched her and the earrings were found in her bag. They were returned to me and they asked if I wanted to press charges. I wanted to talk to my fianc\u00e9 first and he said he would support me if I wanted to. I didn\u2019t want to decide in that moment so I just ignored it and had a great night. \n\nThat was a week ago and ever since then i\u2019ve been getting loads of threatening messages and calls from my husbands side for the family. My mother in law has been sending me extremely hateful texts and I think I want to press charges but I\u2019m still not sure if it\u2019s a good idea.", "created_utc": 1668599463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywrbt8/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_my_mother_in_law/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Something to consider:\n\nIf you don't press charges, she/they will pretend it never happened after a short time.\n\nOnce she thinks she got away with it, she, and the people harassing you, will start saying you made up the story of her getting caught stealing.\n\nI've dealt with people like this. Good luck.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, the harassment/threatening messages need to be reported as well.", "NTA. \n\nThe fact she's continuing to give you grief despite the fact she was caught red-handed would definitely have me pressing charges. She could have wound her neck in and had the decency to be silently ashamed of herself, now she can pay the price.", "NTA at all, and frankly I\u2019d be in the fence about pressing charges too. \n\nI think firstly though, your fianc\u00e9 needs to give his mum a serious bollocking and set boundaries. \n\nIf her campaign of defamation doesn\u2019t end after that talk, press charges.", "NTA. She stole something that was valuable, both in terms of money and sentimental value. Does that side of the family not realise that the earrings were taken without your permission, found on her person, and that stealing is a crime?\n\nGlad she didn't completely ruin the wedding day for you though!", "NTA - they say when people show you who they are, believe them. She has shown you that she is a liar, a thief and that she isn\u2019t afraid to manipulate people by playing the victim card. \n\nIt sounds like your husband (congratulations) is on your side with this. Let him lay down the law and if she doesn\u2019t apologise take it from there. Beware if any time limits for pressing charges.", "NTA. I would not have pressed charges but would now.

So yea, NTA and she sounds horrible.", "NTA. She stole your earrings and then lied about it. Not only that, she stole it before your weddings which meant you had the possibility of being distraught ON your wedding day due to \u201closing them\u201d. I want to say press charges because she had it coming to her, however, she\u2019s your MIL and she will try either way to ruin your marriage\n\nCongrats on your wedding!", "NTA \n\nPress charges. Hit her with everything you can. \n\nShe knows what she did, the family knows, even your husband knows. She\u2019s deflecting and trying to intimidate you, and you need to establish boundaries now, not later!", "I am so sorry. My MIL doesn\u2019t like me (though she won\u2019t admit it\u2026it comes out in other ways) but she would never sabotage our wedding day!  NTA for calling the police. She is lucky you didn\u2019t press charges. For all of the relatives sending you nasty messages, I think you could just reply, \u201cWhat would you do if your MIL stole the heirloom earrings that have been in your family for generations on your wedding day?\u201d", "NTA. \n\nPress charges. She\u2019s a piece of work. If you don\u2019t, she\u2019ll think she\u2019s won and will spend the remaining years of her life trying to ruin your marriage.

Sorry to hear you married into that family.", "NTA she\u2019s a thief!!", "Press charges", "NTA.\n\nPress charges on her.  I can't believe it's even a question in your mind.", "NTA, of course. Calling the police was the right thing to do.\n\nI don't know what does your husband say about this. What does he think about his mother stealing from her fianc\u00e9? Because in my book, that's a huge red flag and would warrant me severing relations with her.\n\nAnyway, you need to start ignoring and blocking your MIL, and then you can decide whether you're pressing charges or not, but you wouldn't be TA en any case.", "NTA.  Call the police. And see if you can get a restraining order.  What else will she steal.  Sure would not trust her will a child.   What did she think was going to happen. You need to get them appraised and give a copy to the cops.", "NTA. she's a thief. And a liar. I'd take it one step further and respond to her side of the family by letting them know you had zero intentions of pressing charges till all their hate changed your mind. They couldn't let it go(when all you were doing was retrieving your earrings) and you've dealt with them long enough, it's now going to be in the authorities hands", "NTA... toxic family... Your stuff.. end of story", "NTA\nTheft is theft.\n\nSorry that you have to deal with AHs for protecting yourself from theft. It's abuse and shows a lot of toxicity on his side of the family.\nI wouldn't want her in my home at that point but you made it clear you're not going to be a doormat and now some are hissy fitting over that.\nI'd point out to them you can call on them for harassment and threats and see if it stops.", "N T A \nPress charges, that should be a felony.", "NTA - first press charge then try to get a restraining order. Your husband is on your side that tells us what we need to know.", "NTA screenshot all the messages, and then press charges.", "NTA! What a very, very stupid and strange thing your MIL did. It was entirely appropriate to call the police on a suspected thief, and it achieved the right result. Anybody who thinks you overreacted is wrong.   \nOf course your MIL is sending you hateful texts; you exposed her as a thief. It's worth thinking about whether you simply go forward as low contact (or no contact, if your husband is in agreement), without pressing charges, or whether you press charges. I'd be inclined to think the first would be less stressful for you. In the end with your quick action no damage was done and the earrings were recovered. But either way I think the relationship with your MIL is toast, unless there are mitigating circumstances like a mental health condition...and even so I don't really see how your (or your husband's) relationship with her can come back from that.", "You\u2019re NTA and it would be totally fair if you want to call the police, but think about it a bit. Coz it\u2019s family and as shitty as they may be there will always be some level of involvement. If she\u2019s permanently no-contact level psycho then go ahead but if you intend to keep in touch/have any future kids have a relationship with her, then really think about it before acting", "NTA \n\nI hope your husband is responding with his phone to his family members that are harassing you. If he is not sticking up for you then seriously look at getting an annulment because it doesn\u2019t get any better.", "NTA what other choice do you have at this point?  She is basically forcing your hand.  Make sure to save all the texts from everyone that sent you.  I hope your husband is worth it bc this baggages is heavy AF.", "NTA what a piece of work she is", "NTA. You wouldn\u2019t even be questioning this if she wasn\u2019t technically family. Crimes and still crimes even when committed by family.", "NTA Go ahead and press charges... So your husbands side of the family is all good with the fact that she stole your earrings? The police found it in her purse damn it... they are going to overlook all of that? Show the Police what they have been sending you...", "First, congratulations on your marriage.\n\nSecond, NTA. I think you and your husband should plan a sit down with her, no one else involved, and talk things through. If she isn't willing to apologize and cease her harassment and set her family straight then I definitely think you should involve the law. Save all the text, in case they want to act smart or funny. Judging from your husband's reaction, he might've seen some type of bullshit coming from her.", "NTA \n\nShe literally stole something that connects you to your family's history on the same day you were likely changing your last name to her son's. That is one of the worst things I've ever heard happening to someone on their wedding day. \n\nIf you press charges you might want to call a divorce attorney because your husband is going to resent you the rest of your marriage unless he's 100000% in your corner on getting charges on his mom's legal record. \n\nIf you'd been wrong though, Holy shit. I wouldn't have had the balls to make the gamble you did.", "NTA block his family. She stole your family heirlooms, a priceless piece of your family history. She stole them knowing the story of their origins. What a piece of work. She needs to be charged with theft and then you need to cut contact with her. What story did she spin to her family that somehow makes you the villain. What a colossal narcissist she sounds like.", "NTA If she had been apologetic and nice after then you might of let it go, but after all the threats I wouldn't. I would also show the police all the messages and texts.", "NTA. Press charges including charges for harassment.", "Start as you mean to go on. You want to teach her now that if she steals from you, it will be painful for her. It doesn\u2019t even matter it her whole family thinks that makes you TA, what\u2019s important here is establishing firm boundaries so the next couple of decades of your life will be a little easier. Show her you hit back hard now because letting her off easy, ESPECIALLY the first time and at the very start of your marriage, will teach her that she can steal from you and get away with it for the minor effort of slicing (edit, siccing) her family on you to call you names.\n\nNTA but don\u2019t try to convince her of that, as far as she\u2019s concerned it\u2019s in your best interest to fly TA flag high and own it with pride. You\u2019re TA she should think twice about effing with.\n\nagain, NTA", "You would not be the assholes to press charges. Not only did she steal a family heirloom, but she's now using her family to harass you.\n\nHowever, if you do press charges you will ruin the relationship between his family and yours, and it will affect your marriage.\n\nYou could also just block all of them and go completely no contact.", "NTA I would have called off the wedding.", "Wtf, definitely NTA. What did your MIL think was going to happen and could she have made it any more obvious, I hate to say it but pressing charges will be in your best interest. Your MIL literally stole from you and then lied to your face about it.", "From experience, my MIL stole my wedding rings years ago and refused to take blame even when caught. Instead, her and her husband tried to blame us for calling the police to get them back. We didn\u2019t press charges and all she got was probation. Can you imagine what happened next? She stole again, not only from other family members but us again once my kind hearted husband caved and allowed her back around. Some people need a hard lesson in the way society works.\nNTA", "NTA. This is insanity. But you are probably cementing some permanent rifts if you press charges, so think carefully about whether you want that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
