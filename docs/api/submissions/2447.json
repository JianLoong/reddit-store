We got engaged about a year ago and when I got engaged my mother gave me a pair of earrings which she said every woman for generations in our family has worn to their weddings. They are 4.00ct dangling earrings and they are worth a lot. I felt very honoured to be given them and it made me feel closer to my grandmother who had died 2 months prior. \n\nAbout 3 months after that I went wedding dress shopping with my mother my sister and my fianc\u00e9s mother. I brought all the jewellery that I would be wearing to my wedding to see how they match the dresses. When I put the jewellery on my mother in law kept going on about how gorgeous the earrings were. My mother explained the story and how they were a family heirloom passed down generations. I found the dress of my dreams and bought it.\n\nOn the day of my wedding i had everything ready in my room. My wedding dress, my flowers, my shoes, my makeup and my jewellery. I was in there with my soon to be mother in law. I then needed to go to the toilet and when I came back my mother in law was gone. I wasn\u2019t sure what had happened but i just thought she maybe got called away to do something. I then noticed my earrings were gone. I knew straight away that she had taken them. \n\nI found her and confronted her and she said she didn\u2019t take them. I asked if I could look through her bag and she said no and gripped onto it. I said that if she didn\u2019t let me look I would call the police which I then did as she still wouldn\u2019t let me look. The police arrived and searched her and the earrings were found in her bag. They were returned to me and they asked if I wanted to press charges. I wanted to talk to my fianc\u00e9 first and he said he would support me if I wanted to. I didn\u2019t want to decide in that moment so I just ignored it and had a great night. \n\nThat was a week ago and ever since then i\u2019ve been getting loads of threatening messages and calls from my husbands side for the family. My mother in law has been sending me extremely hateful texts and I think I want to press charges but I\u2019m still not sure if it\u2019s a good idea.", "created_utc": 1668599463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywrbt8/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_my_mother_in_law/", "score": 1405, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was entirely appropriate to call the police on a suspected thief, and it achieved the right result. Anybody who thinks you overreacted is wrong.   \nOf course your MIL is sending you hateful texts; you exposed her as a thief. It's worth thinking about whether you simply go forward as low contact (or no contact, if your husband is in agreement), without pressing charges, or whether you press charges. I'd be inclined to think the first would be less stressful for you. In the end with your quick action no damage was done and the earrings were recovered. But either way I think the relationship with your MIL is toast, unless there are mitigating circumstances like a mental health condition...and even so I don't really see how your (or your husband's) relationship with her can come back from that.", "You\u2019re NTA and it would be totally fair if you want to call the police, but think about it a bit. Coz it\u2019s family and as shitty as they may be there will always be some level of involvement.

I think you and your husband should plan a sit down with her, no one else involved, and talk things through. If she isn't willing to apologize and cease her harassment and set her family straight then I definitely think you should involve the law. Save all the text, in case they want to act smart or funny. Judging from your husband's reaction, he might've seen some type of bullshit coming from her.", "NTA \n\nShe literally stole something that connects you to your family's history on the same day you were likely changing your last name to her son's. That is one of the worst things I've ever heard happening to someone on their wedding day. \n\nIf you press charges you might want to call a divorce attorney because your husband is going to resent you the rest of your marriage unless he's 100000% in your corner on getting charges on his mom's legal record. \n\nIf you'd been wrong though, Holy shit. I wouldn't have had the balls to make the gamble you did.", "NTA block his family. She stole your family heirlooms, a priceless piece of your family history.

You want to teach her now that if she steals from you, it will be painful for her. It doesn\u2019t even matter it her whole family thinks that makes you TA, what\u2019s important here is establishing firm boundaries so the next couple of decades of your life will be a little easier. Show her you hit back hard now because letting her off easy, ESPECIALLY the first time and at the very start of your marriage, will teach her that she can steal from you and get away with it for the minor effort of slicing (edit, siccing) her family on you to call you names.\n\nNTA but don\u2019t try to convince her of that, as far as she\u2019s concerned it\u2019s in your best interest to fly TA flag high and own it with pride.

What did your MIL think was going to happen and could she have made it any more obvious, I hate to say it but pressing charges will be in your best interest. Your MIL literally stole from you and then lied to your face about it.", "From experience, my MIL stole my wedding rings years ago and refused to take blame even when caught. Instead, her and her husband tried to blame us for calling the police to get them back. We didn\u2019t press charges and all she got was probation. Can you imagine what happened next? She stole again, not only from other family members but us again once my kind hearted husband caved and allowed her back around. Some people need a hard lesson in the way society works.\nNTA", "NTA.

To steal a cherished family heirloom from you on your wedding day is absolutely despicable. To then show no remorse and encourage other people to harass you is next level nasty behaviour. She needs to be held accountable, and her theft on the record, so that her inevitable gaslighting has no oxygen. \n\nIt is very hard to imagine a way back for your relationship with her. However, if there is even a remote chance, it starts with her facing the consequences of her horrific actions. Only then can she start to very slowly and sincerely demonstrate genuine remorse and start the long process of redeeming herself. I wouldn't hold my breath on that but any possible healing starts with you pressing charges and her facing the music. And blocking any family member who objects.

If you can have the police report updated with the appraised value even better, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s possible after the fact.

NEW 4 CT. earrings that dangle can run upwards of 50k USD (obvious factors such as style, cut, clarity, color, etc.). These are antique, which will definitely raise the price. \n\nAlso file harassment charges due to her family harassing you. I'm hoping you've told your husband about this. He needs to be prepared to lose family. If they are all acting like that, it's inevitable some will never even believe your husband, nor testimony in court. Tough pill to swallow, but it's for the best. \n\nFinally, get a safety deposit box and hide them away in there. At some point, someone will try to take them as revenge. Hell, it could even be an aunt or cousin that hasn't said anything yet, even a sibling. Lock them up in a secure and safe place. \n\nEven years from now, after she's \"reformed\", keep her at arms length. She sounds like the type that would try to turn your future children against you because \"poor grandma\" had to go to prison. That's the last thing you'll want. No contact would be best for good, which is hard (doing that myself for reasons), but emotionally and mentally better for you. \n\nIf your husband is against charges being filed due to this being a felony, be prepared for things to get ugly, but do not cave.
