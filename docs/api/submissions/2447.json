We got engaged about a year ago and when I got engaged my mother gave me a pair of earrings which she said every woman for generations in our family has worn to their weddings. They are 4.00ct dangling earrings and they are worth a lot. I felt very honoured to be given them and it made me feel closer to my grandmother who had died 2 months prior. \n\nAbout 3 months after that I went wedding dress shopping with my mother my sister and my fianc\u00e9s mother. I brought all the jewellery that I would be wearing to my wedding to see how they match the dresses. When I put the jewellery on my mother in law kept going on about how gorgeous the earrings were. My mother explained the story and how they were a family heirloom passed down generations. I found the dress of my dreams and bought it.\n\nOn the day of my wedding i had everything ready in my room. My wedding dress, my flowers, my shoes, my makeup and my jewellery. I was in there with my soon to be mother in law. I then needed to go to the toilet and when I came back my mother in law was gone. I wasn\u2019t sure what had happened but i just thought she maybe got called away to do something. I then noticed my earrings were gone. I knew straight away that she had taken them. \n\nI found her and confronted her and she said she didn\u2019t take them. I asked if I could look through her bag and she said no and gripped onto it. I said that if she didn\u2019t let me look I would call the police which I then did as she still wouldn\u2019t let me look. The police arrived and searched her and the earrings were found in her bag. They were returned to me and they asked if I wanted to press charges. I wanted to talk to my fianc\u00e9 first and he said he would support me if I wanted to. I didn\u2019t want to decide in that moment so I just ignored it and had a great night. \n\nThat was a week ago and ever since then i\u2019ve been getting loads of threatening messages and calls from my husbands side for the family. My mother in law has been sending me extremely hateful texts and I think I want to press charges but I\u2019m still not sure if it\u2019s a good idea.", "created_utc": 1668599463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywrbt8/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_my_mother_in_law/", "score": 10110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was entirely appropriate to call the police on a suspected thief, and it achieved the right result. Anybody who thinks you overreacted is wrong.   \nOf course your MIL is sending you hateful texts; you exposed her as a thief. It's worth thinking about whether you simply go forward as low contact (or no contact, if your husband is in agreement), without pressing charges, or whether you press charges. I'd be inclined to think the first would be less stressful for you. In the end with your quick action no damage was done and the earrings were recovered. But either way I think the relationship with your MIL is toast, unless there are mitigating circumstances like a mental health condition...and even so I don't really see how your (or your husband's) relationship with her can come back from that.", "You\u2019re NTA and it would be totally fair if you want to call the police, but think about it a bit. Coz it\u2019s family and as shitty as they may be there will always be some level of involvement.

I think you and your husband should plan a sit down with her, no one else involved, and talk things through. If she isn't willing to apologize and cease her harassment and set her family straight then I definitely think you should involve the law. Save all the text, in case they want to act smart or funny. Judging from your husband's reaction, he might've seen some type of bullshit coming from her.", "NTA \n\nShe literally stole something that connects you to your family's history on the same day you were likely changing your last name to her son's. That is one of the worst things I've ever heard happening to someone on their wedding day. \n\nIf you press charges you might want to call a divorce attorney because your husband is going to resent you the rest of your marriage unless he's 100000% in your corner on getting charges on his mom's legal record. \n\nIf you'd been wrong though, Holy shit. I wouldn't have had the balls to make the gamble you did.", "NTA block his family. She stole your family heirlooms, a priceless piece of your family history.

You want to teach her now that if she steals from you, it will be painful for her. It doesn\u2019t even matter it her whole family thinks that makes you TA, what\u2019s important here is establishing firm boundaries so the next couple of decades of your life will be a little easier. Show her you hit back hard now because letting her off easy, ESPECIALLY the first time and at the very start of your marriage, will teach her that she can steal from you and get away with it for the minor effort of slicing (edit, siccing) her family on you to call you names.\n\nNTA but don\u2019t try to convince her of that, as far as she\u2019s concerned it\u2019s in your best interest to fly TA flag high and own it with pride.

What did your MIL think was going to happen and could she have made it any more obvious, I hate to say it but pressing charges will be in your best interest. Your MIL literally stole from you and then lied to your face about it.", "From experience, my MIL stole my wedding rings years ago and refused to take blame even when caught. Instead, her and her husband tried to blame us for calling the police to get them back. We didn\u2019t press charges and all she got was probation. Can you imagine what happened next? She stole again, not only from other family members but us again once my kind hearted husband caved and allowed her back around. Some people need a hard lesson in the way society works.\nNTA", "NTA.

To steal a cherished family heirloom from you on your wedding day is absolutely despicable. To then show no remorse and encourage other people to harass you is next level nasty behaviour. She needs to be held accountable, and her theft on the record, so that her inevitable gaslighting has no oxygen. \n\nIt is very hard to imagine a way back for your relationship with her. However, if there is even a remote chance, it starts with her facing the consequences of her horrific actions. Only then can she start to very slowly and sincerely demonstrate genuine remorse and start the long process of redeeming herself. I wouldn't hold my breath on that but any possible healing starts with you pressing charges and her facing the music. And blocking any family member who objects.

NEW 4 CT. earrings that dangle can run upwards of 50k USD (obvious factors such as style, cut, clarity, color, etc.). These are antique, which will definitely raise the price. \n\nAlso file harassment charges due to her family harassing you. I'm hoping you've told your husband about this. He needs to be prepared to lose family. If they are all acting like that, it's inevitable some will never even believe your husband, nor testimony in court. Tough pill to swallow, but it's for the best. \n\nFinally, get a safety deposit box and hide them away in there. At some point, someone will try to take them as revenge. Hell, it could even be an aunt or cousin that hasn't said anything yet, even a sibling. Lock them up in a secure and safe place. \n\nEven years from now, after she's \"reformed\", keep her at arms length.

She can\u2019t even wear them around OP.", "Even more reason to press charges. That side of the family is shady and your probably were never going to hang out with them anyway. She could\u2019ve let it go/taken the favor and now she\u2019s dragging it on. Be sure to add harassment, intimidation and threats to the charges. It\u2019s only been a week, but the sooner you do it the better.", "4.  Put them down her panties do the police didn\u2019t find them. \n\n5. Put them in a potted plant, come get them later. \n\nI mean, there were more foolproof ways to steal the objects for their own value. Her intent was to take away objects that made OP happy on her special day. She is just vile.", "She's probably lying about it as well, and saying she temporarily put them in her purse to protect them, and now she's being attacked.

I just googled this and it says \"Under the Fourth Amendment, police officers must obtain written permission from a court of law to legally search a person and their property, and seize evidence while they are investigating possible criminal activity. And evidence obtained through illegal searches is not admissible in a court of law.\"\n\nIs the OP not in the US? Is this sort of thing common outside the US? Is there something I don't know about here where US police will respond to a call and then search someone on the spot? Or is this post another of the many creative writing exercises fabricated for our amusement? I admit I know little about this...", "NTA OP. However, I will note that there are two things you should do first. \n\nFirst, your husband should lay down the law with his family, the fact that he hasn't stepped in yet to end the harassment is troubling to say the least. \n\nSecond, you need to sit down with your husband and have a frank discussion about the consequences for his mother. 4ct earrings are not cheap and could well fall under the category of felony theft. Felony theft will likely include jail time. Make sure your husband knows and is onboard with sending his mother to prison. Whether or not she deserves it (and to be clear, she does) she is still his mother and sending her to jail is definitely going to strain their relationship, completely end your relationship with her, and depending on how your husband reacts possibly strain your relationship with him. He may be on board with scaring her straight but not sending her to prison. Or maybe he is fully in support. But you two are married, you need to have a real and thorough conversation about this before you do anything. Him saying he will support whatever you decide falls short in my mind because it isn't him affirmatively supporting the potential consequences.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you, that really sucks. Good luck to you moving forward.", "NTA.  So sorry.  I am not sure if I would press charges or not, but I DEFINITELY would go NC with anyone taking your mother-in-law's side.  I can't think of a trashier thing to do.\n\nAnd think of the bright side.  She just saved you years of putting up with her shit.  Block them all.", "My first instinct is to press charges but honestly I think I would just go NC to his entire family and be done with it. Too much drama and life\u2019s too short.", "Has MIL convinced her family that you made it up/twisted the facts? Hopefully pressing charges and getting her convicted will show them she is full of it. \n\nEither way, she\u2019s made it clear she\u2019ll keep pushing so pressing charges is the best way to push back. May need to follow it up with a restraining order as well. NTA", "NTA. You'd think MIL and her family would be trying to be nice instead of harassing OP since they don't want her to press charges. WTF evenwas her plan? To sell her daughter-in-law's heirloom jewelry or was she hoping OP would flip out about the missing earrings and they'd stop the wedding? Also, if MIL doesn't realize she did something extremely wrong right before her son's wedding and feel at least a little remorse, there's no hope for her and no point in not pressing charges. She needs to learn her lesson before she does something worse to OP. Because I'm petty, I'd ask MIL and her family how her future grandkids will feel when they find out their grandmother stole their mom's heirloom earrings right before the wedding, lied about it, and then got the whole family to harrass their mom for calling the police to recover her jewelry. Heck, since MIL'S whole family is harassing OP now, I'd tell the whole lot of them that they'll never be permitted anywhere near any future grandkids and you, your husband, and any future kids will be spending all holidays with OP's extended family unless they get some serious therapy and sincerely apologize.", "Yeah, I\u2019m so confused at why they are harassing her. Like do they expect her to hand over the earrings? Like it makes no sense especially since she was caught with the earrings. It\u2019s not op\u2019s fault she\u2019s a horrible criminal.

I can't imagine doing something so hateful and ugly to the woman my son loves enough to spend his life with.", "OP, it says a lot about a woman when her own son isn\u2019t surprised by her attempted theft. Call the police and press charges. The only reason you\u2019re getting harassed by multiple people is because those people realize that something big is at stake, that there\u2019s no way out, and are hoping to use mob pressure to brute force a way out for their favorite thief. I\u2019ll tell you what I told my favorite pro bono client: for every fool that is trying to keep you from doing the right thing, that\u2019s one more unscrupulous person that deserves punishment. Have MIL arrested, and inform anyone else who harasses you after that unless they want to join MIL in jail for witness tampering, they should stop their attempts to intimidate you into dropping the charges.", "Agreed!

It was a modest, simple pendent style necklace, simple chain.  \nPeople are just F\\*king weird.", "Mommy dearest already set that bridge ablaze", "Right? Was she expecting that the bride won't notice on the wedding day of all times?", "She didn't think OP would make a fuss on her wedding day", "Sauce?", "I think it could still work with a little tweaking.
