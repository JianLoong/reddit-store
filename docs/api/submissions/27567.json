Some of you may read the title and think I\u2019m horrible so I need to give a lot of backstory. \n\nMy parents are divorced. My dad (who is putting about 15,000 toward the wedding) has a second wife and lives in a different state. He has 2 kids with her. His daughter (7) was born sick and I wanna make this as anonymous as possible so that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about the illness. My dad told us she was probably not going to live very long. She died last November (2022). My dad and his wife want a special memorial table dedicated only to her next to where we planned to set up other pictures. I politely said no and my bf agrees with me. Maybe I\u2019d feel different if I was closer to her but I really only met her maybe a dozen times. I haven\u2019t seen her since Christmas of 2021 which was the last time I visited my dads state. I feel like it will bum people out, and my bfs family doesn\u2019t know she is and neither do alot of friends. I don\u2019t have anything against her I just never really knew her. They\u2019re pushing this because the wedding is near the one year anniversary of her death. \n\nSecond issue. My sister (24) has a long dating history and always insists on bringing the guy to every family thing almost immediately. There\u2019s probably a run of 6 Christmas photos in a row where there\u2019s a different guy there with her. She has been with this guy now since July. We had the seating set before she started dating him. I don\u2019t even want to invite him but caved on that for my sister. She is at the head table and I don\u2019t want to try to squeeze someone else in, or kick someone out so he is sitting at a table with a few of her friends. Sister is very upset because she wants him sitting next to her. But I barely know the guy I don\u2019t want to change seating so he could be at the table. I also told her I would be offended if she wanted to sit with him over me. Also it\u2019s not like people are going to be sitting besides dinner so she will have plenty of time with him. \n\nSo wondering if I\u2019m an asshole bridezilla here.\n\nEdit Yo obviously we are going to have a picture of my half sister on the table at the wedding but I just don\u2019t want an entire table for her.", "created_utc": 1695599323, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rcome/aita_for_not_wanting_a_memorial_for_my_half/", "score": 287, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was literally just me and my husband. We wanted some quiet time for ourselves during the wedding day. We had a great time. This way, your sister cans sit with everyone else including her bf.", "NTA on both counts, a wedding is really no place for a memorial, they are just two completely different sets of emotions.

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being unreasonable at all", "NTA Why do families think that weddings are there to propose to your gf announce a pregnancy or secret engagement or secret courthouse marriage or celebrate dead babys sisters brothers etc???

Give them the table. Yes it is your wedding, but one table you will see a few times isn't worth this, plus itll mean so much more to them than itll be unwanted by you. Look at their view, thats one daughter they'll never get to see do this. And parents losing a kid, even when they have others, is an unimaginable loss. That table may seem out of place to you and your fiance, and maybe even everyone but your dad and his wife. But it'll mean everything to them. And for 15 grand, give them the table.

Do you give a shit about what they feel about it? The fact that you don't even understand how heartbroken they were when you asked to not have the table is telling.  They gave you $15k and you told them having a memorial for your sister, and their daughter, who died of an tragic illness at the age of , would have ruined your big day. They probably feel like they've lost two daughters. Do you care what the internet thinks or what your family thinks?", "Yes, she has every right to tell the people paying $15k for her wedding, that a memorial for their dead 7 year old daughter would ruin her big day. And obviously those people are going to think she's an asshole. The fact that the dead girl is actually her sister makes it 10x worse. And she blows it off as not a big deal because she didn't have that close of a relationship with the girl because she died to soon. Imagine if your kid told you that.", "Compromise and do the photo table of your sister with all the different dates instead.", "Yes I\u2019m aware. It\u2019s just for dinner.", "I do care what my family thinks.  But it just doesn\u2019t work. I think they will understand.", "It is an f-ing wedding", "In that case,  everything seems totally reasonable. Have a wonderful wedding and a beautiful life together."]}
