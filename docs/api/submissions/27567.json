Some of you may read the title and think I\u2019m horrible so I need to give a lot of backstory. \n\nMy parents are divorced. My dad (who is putting about 15,000 toward the wedding) has a second wife and lives in a different state. He has 2 kids with her. His daughter (7) was born sick and I wanna make this as anonymous as possible so that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about the illness. My dad told us she was probably not going to live very long. She died last November (2022). My dad and his wife want a special memorial table dedicated only to her next to where we planned to set up other pictures. I politely said no and my bf agrees with me. Maybe I\u2019d feel different if I was closer to her but I really only met her maybe a dozen times. I haven\u2019t seen her since Christmas of 2021 which was the last time I visited my dads state. I feel like it will bum people out, and my bfs family doesn\u2019t know she is and neither do alot of friends. I don\u2019t have anything against her I just never really knew her. They\u2019re pushing this because the wedding is near the one year anniversary of her death. \n\nSecond issue. My sister (24) has a long dating history and always insists on bringing the guy to every family thing almost immediately. There\u2019s probably a run of 6 Christmas photos in a row where there\u2019s a different guy there with her. She has been with this guy now since July. We had the seating set before she started dating him. I don\u2019t even want to invite him but caved on that for my sister. She is at the head table and I don\u2019t want to try to squeeze someone else in, or kick someone out so he is sitting at a table with a few of her friends. Sister is very upset because she wants him sitting next to her. But I barely know the guy I don\u2019t want to change seating so he could be at the table. I also told her I would be offended if she wanted to sit with him over me. Also it\u2019s not like people are going to be sitting besides dinner so she will have plenty of time with him. \n\nSo wondering if I\u2019m an asshole bridezilla here.\n\nEdit Yo obviously we are going to have a picture of my half sister on the table at the wedding but I just don\u2019t want an entire table for her.", "created_utc": 1695599323, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rcome/aita_for_not_wanting_a_memorial_for_my_half/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The half sister was essentially a stranger to you have a small chair reserved for her is enough specially cause most of the guests won't know who she was and probably won't be attached to her either. \n\nFor problem 2 even more NTA for all you know sis won't be dating this guy by the time of the wedding or well next year at least (you have plenty of evidence with the Christmas fotos) tell your sis you already made enough of a compromise for agreeing to invite who is practically a stranger to the wedding but you won't treat him as family and if she is really uncomfortable with the idea of having him stay at another table then advice her you think is best if he doesn't come. If she potest to that just be firm with your compromise even he stays at his assigned sitting or doesn't come no ifs or buts be firm", "NTA \nYou're being completely reasonable on both counts.", "NTA. \n\nRegarding the deceased. I recommend putting out a bouquet of flowers with the sign saying they are dedicated to all those who could not be here today. Then it acknowledges your sister and anyone else who could not come. Maybe don\u2019t mention the latter to your dad and his second family. \n\nAs for your sister. Easy. Change the seating. For my head table it was literally just me and my husband. We wanted some quiet time for ourselves during the wedding day. We had a great time. This way, your sister cans sit with everyone else including her bf.", "NTA on both counts, a wedding is really no place for a memorial, they are just two completely different sets of emotions. The sisters boyfriend needs to sit at the tables with the \"others\". Every wedding seems to have one, he doesn't belong at the head table since that is for the wedding party, most of the time the wedding party is not sitting with their spouses or SO either.", "NTA. \n\n1. Your father can have his own memorial event for your half sister (and it doesn't matter how much $ he contributed, it was for a WEDDING, not a MEMORIAL TABLE).\n\n2. It's perfectly normal to seat only the wedding party at the head table. She's not required to sit there very long and she can be separated from her date for one meal. Your wedding isn't about her.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think a memorial for your half sister is appropriate if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you want to do.\n\nAnd your sister\u2019s boyfriend can go and sit at a different table or he can skip the wedding.", "NTA - Having a memorial at a wedding is just not proper as it doesn't give either event its proper respect..  Suggest to your Dad that you can have a memorial at your house at a later date where the focus could solely be on the departed daughter.  As far as BF #7, it is your wedding and your sister should understand he and she is lucky that you invited him at all.  You don't want him at the main table with you, your wedding, your choice.  They will just have to suck it up or he can be just as easily uninvited, her and BF #7's choice.  Tell her to pick one.", "NTA for both points.\n\nHalf-sister: you said she\u2019d be included on the family picture table. Having a whole separate table just for her is a bit much.\n\nSister\u2019s  current boyfriend: at the weddings I\u2019ve been in and attended, the head table is for the wedding party only. Spouses/SOs/ dates are seated with the rest of the guests. Even when there\u2019s a sweetheart table, the bridesmaids/groomsmen/ushers have had their own tables, with their \u2018others\u2019 being seated separately.", "NTA. \n\nA memorial for someone you don\u2019t really know is weird. But since your dad is paying for a lot of this, maybe a compromise is in order. Maybe you could do something special for them outside of the wedding, like memorializing a bench or a rose bush or something to that effect local to them. \n\nAs for the seating, I have been the bridesmaid and the wedding party\u2019s + 1 and the + 1s always sit at another table. If she really wants to argue it, just say it\u2019s a seating arrangement thing and you can\u2019t make changes last minute. The end.", "NTA\n\nBoth very reasonable positions and your edit makes it clear you're not trying to erase your half sister.\n\nThe good news is your sister will probably be with a different guy by next Christmas and your first wedding anniversary.", "NTA. It\u2019s nice that your dad is contributing but this is your day, not theirs.", "NTA. A wedding is an inappropriate setting for a memorial. Your dad and stepmom are old enough to know this. As for your sister\u2019s date, seat him wherever the dates of the rest of the wedding party are being seated. And really, at every wedding I\u2019ve been to, after dinner people walk around, mingle, and sit in different spots anyway.", "NTA.  Look, just because your dad is paying does not mean he gets to call the shots. This should be a GIFT of money for your wedding. You take it, you say thank you very much, and you proceed with your vision.\n\n You already have a photo of your half-sister. This is a wedding, not a memorial service. Why would people who have never met her be moved to - what? Pray at a shrine? That's weird.\n\nAnd you're right not to change the seating arrangements. It's not all night anyway.  People move seats all the time. Before the meal and afterwards,  your sister and her boyfriend du jour will have plenty of time to be together at a table.", "INFO on two fronts:\n\n1.  Is there any way to turn down your dad\u2019s money without sacrificing something at your wedding?\n\n2.  Is there any way you can go back to your sister and tell her that the boyfriend cannot show up?", "NTA,  it's your wedding, and your dad's request is unreasonable, as is your sister's.", "NTA!", "NTA. This is your wedding day, not your half sister's memorial. \nAs for the random dude? Nah. Sit with the guests.", "NTA. It\u2019s a shame what your dad went through but your wedding isn\u2019t the time for that. And your sister just seems dumb.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
