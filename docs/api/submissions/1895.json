I went on my own, as my friends weren\u2019t able to come, which I didn\u2019t mind. Because the group of kids we went with were known for being well-behaved, the teacher\u2019s were very lax and strict about most things - like for example, obviously weren\u2019t allowed in the boy\u2019s hotel rooms but people still managed to sneak into them - Including the couple. During the day, the couple never leave each other\u2019s side and they\u2019re basically inseparable. So, keep in mind, the girl is with her bf the whole trip. One day we go on a tour bus and it ends up being kind of filled up but not packed. I managed to get a seat near to the front, right where the bus still has shade but you can still have a great view and the seat beside me was empty. I liked my seat. I had made sure to wait all the way at the front just to get it. Because the bus was sort of packed, everyone either sat next to each other or strangers but the couple was too slow, so they had to sit separately. As I was the only one with space next to me, the girl of the couple decided to come up to me and ask me to give up my seat so they could sit together, and since I didn\u2019t want to, especially since the seat was all the way at the back, I declined.\n\nThis genuinely upset the girl to the point where she told our teacher, who didn\u2019t really respond to her, and for the rest of the trip she didn\u2019t speak to me or look in my direction. Her boyfriend also seemed indifferent but he also appeared to also be kind of annoyed. I felt bad because I suppose they considered it a couples vacation and didn\u2019t want to be apart from each other, but the girl I share a room with at the hotel said she wouldn\u2019t have given up the seat either. The girl looked distraught and it seemed to have ruined her day (the bus ride lasts about an hour) and she didn\u2019t really speak much after that.

The teacher was NOT going to force you to give up a seat because they got on last and she can't bear to not sit with her boyfriend for a minute. It wasn't a couples vacation.
