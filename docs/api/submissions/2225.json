My wife (26F) had a girls night sleepover with her mom and our nieces (5F and 3F). My only request was that the guests stayed in the guest room. We have a guest room with a Full sized bed that should\u2019ve fit them all just fine. Her mom smokes and I just knew there\u2019d be an accident if one of the nieces slept in the bed. \nSo I come home and my older niece is in bed with my wife and I notice all the covers and sheets were gone and there was a massive stain on the headboard. My niece had puked over everything from eating to much candy and ice cream. \n\nFor a bit of backstory, when we were saving for our house, we slept on an old mattress that had springs coming through it, just waiting to buy our house and upgrade. We dropped over $6000 on our bed as soon as we moved. \n\nIm trying not to make a scene because our guests are still here, but I just told her I\u2019m not happy with how things ended up. She apologized but I\u2019m still upset on the matter. \n\nBTW I didn\u2019t let my niece see any of my discomfort, I understand that she\u2019s a child and can\u2019t help making a mess if she gets sick.

Any chance y'all had a protective mattress cover on it?", "NTA because you made your feelings clear early on. Maybe nobody is the asshole though because if the kids wasn't feeling well and wanted to sleep with her aunt, I know I would have a very hard time saying no. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is you obviously have a right to be upset, but it may be worth evaluating if this is the hill you want to die on, giving the circumstances.", "There was no need for them to be in the bed, your concerns were ignored and surprise, surprise the bed was spoiled regardless of why there should be no how as you raised the issue in advance. The amount of comments I have read where humans are less important than pets I am confused how they are more important things! People are odd  how does your s/o propose to clean the stain and eliminate the smell completely?", "NTA\n\nI would be livid as well.

That's an expensive bed, so I'd be upset.", "NTA, you made a reasonable request and your bed is important to you as it\u2019s a symbol of how you\u2019ve come probably and means a lot that you can afford nice things which have been disrespected.

Your wife needs to understand she overstepped and ruined something you valued.", "NTA you had one wish and no obligation to host. This is a clear cut case of boundary violation, regardless of whether the niece actually puked on your bed, or made any mess at all. It is your bedroom and you have a right to say that guests should not be allowed. Wife violated your trust.

Obv.", "NTA some unsolicited advice\u2026 you can get a portable stem cleaner to have it cleaned. \nI also admire that you sound pretty respectful about the whole thing and also didn\u2019t show your discomfort in front of the kids. I also understand why your a bit pissed that your wife disrespected your boundaries but your explanation of the kid wanted to probably snuggle is also decent to admit. In the grand scheme of things even though things were damaged, this is minor and hopefully fixed.", "INFO: You have some facts missing. How did this happen? Your niece may have been sleeping in the guest room, but when she fell ill she went to her aunt for comfort and got sick all over the bed. That\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair of you to assume she was sick due to over eating. Children get sick all the time for a plethora of reasons.", "NTA and I understand this just cuz I don't like others in my bed. Her responsibility to get it cleaned asap.", "NTA, your wife should respect the limits imposed by you, and she was still very mature in caring about the guests and not making a scene, I recommend having a good conversation with your wife so you don't go over limits again, but in case it's something that happens always good and better to analyze this relationship", "Nta I'm sorry about your bed", "NTA. Is your wife remorseful, or just wanting you to get over it? Regardless, it\u2019s not cool to stomp on the one thing you asked of her.", "NTA in the least. Bedrooms are sanctuaries for most people and boundaries regarding their use needs to be respected by both partners.\n\nKudos for not showing your annoyance in front of you guests.", "NTA that\u2019s an extremely reasonable request and to top it off, the mattress is 6000 dollars why even risk that. And for the people who are saying AH for two aunts and a kid can\u2019t fit in a full size bed, sure that\u2019s fair. They knew the sleeping arrangements as they\u2019ve been their before they could\u2019ve brought an air mattress or someone could\u2019ve slept on the couch", "NTA your wife ignoring your boundary is a red flag", "I\u2019m leaning to YTA. \n\nInfo:\n1. were having a movie night in bed before going to the guest room and niece got sick?  \n2. Do nieces sleep in bed with their mom each night? \n3. Do your nieces scare easy so it\u2019s more comfortable  for them to sleep in a new space with their aunt? \n4. If you \u201cjust knew\u201d that there was going to be an accident, why don\u2019t you have a mattress protector and some cheap sheets to use when nieces sleep over? \n\nThese girls are very young. It seems reasonable they\u2019d want the comfort of an adult in a house that isn\u2019t theirs and there are really easy ways to protect your bed from accidents and spills.", "YTA.
