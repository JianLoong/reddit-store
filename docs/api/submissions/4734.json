Trading meds isn't a good idea and like you said, it's illegal. You aren't her doctor and don't have the authority to prescribe her anything, nor the MD to monitor her while taking them. There is a reason why things like Adderall require the prescription to be approved and renewed by a doctor monthly, it's an amphetamine. Highly addictive too. She can get them herself if she needs them so badly.", "NTA. Your medication are based on your \u2018problems\u2019. So they can have a different effect on your mom. And in combination with weed that is a no go", "NTA. Not only is entirely your right to say no to her, but it's also very much the right thing to do. If she wants to get on ADHD meds, she can absolutely go and get her own prescription for the proper dosage for her. Definitely look into safely getting rid of your excess pills and then you can be done with this situation.", "NTA\n\nThose meds could cause all sorts of complications with any other medications she is taking or if she has high blood pressure. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the US you can go to the pharmacy and ask for a safe drug disposal bag. It might cost like five bucks or so depending on where you are. It\u2019s a pre-paid envelope you can stick your unneeded pills in, drop in the mail and they will safely dispose of everything.", "NTA.  That may not be the right dosage or medication for her.....on top the fact that it would be illegal!!  If you're in the US, you can probably turn the unused meds in to law enforcement, a pharmacy or a doctor for disposal. That way when she asks you just say you disposes of it", "NTA.  If someone has ADHD, their meds stabilize their moods.  Your mom wanting your meds to be productive, IMO, sounds like she likes abusing the meds.  She's not using them for the purpose they are meant for.", "Do not ever give your prescription to someone else. EVER. Unless it's an emergency or something.\n\nFor one it is illegal. ADHD meds are classed as schedule II, and it is a felony to distribute them. Regardless of how likely it is anyone would find out of what not, it's better to not take the risk. You don't want to become a felon, get a fine, or have your medication taken away.\n\nSecond, you don't know how mom will react. While the risk is low, the possibility of a bad or allergic reaction (or an overdose) is there. And you would be found responsible/negligent in the court of law\n\nNTA, DO NOT GIVE AWAY YOUR MEDICATION", "NTA She needs to be a fucking adult and see her doctor. Do NOT give her your meds, OP, it is both illegal and unwise, you don't know what dosage is right for her.", "NTA\n\nReturn your unused pills to a pharmacy to be properly disposed of. If you no longer have \u2018spares\u2019 you can\u2019t be pressured to give her any.", "NAH but I'm not sure what else you are going to do with the meds.

I tried to start back up again after 2 weeks of not taking it and I ended up in the ER because my body wasn't adjusted to the high dose anymore. \n\nI highly recommend not giving her any, and not risking it. It was not fun. I felt like I was dying haha", "Wow, that's a pretty enormous dose of Concerta. Not a doctor, and I don't know your medical and psychiatric history, so I'm in no position to make a judgement about it - but I can understand why that would be very worrying.\n\nAnyway, my mistake!", "I'm on 54mg of Concerta. That's a pretty standard adult dose from what my psychiatrist says. But it's wayyyyy too much to just jump onto, I guarantee OPs mom will end up in the hospital if she takes one. I stopped my ADHD meds for 2 weeks and tried to immediately get back onto the full dose and ended up in the ER because my body was no longer used to it. I can't skip more than 2 days or I have to worry about my body not being adjusted to the dose."]}
