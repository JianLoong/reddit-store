Jeff STILL hasn't told his family or many friends we aren't together anymore. This works because we live on different continents & his parents live on a 3rd continent (they are central European). He says this is to protect his elderly parents, including a mother w/ a serious drinking problem. I suspect he\u2019s also embarrassed our marriage failed. I understand & I've been ok with playing along, & continue to be warm and friendly with his family, who are decent people.\n\nBut now his sister\u2019s getting married, & Jeff wants me to come w/ him & pretend  we are still married. Doing this will involve: taking a week off work, paying $2000 to fly to their country, sharing a room with Jeff at his parents' house so they don't suspect, & lying to everyone for a week. In addition, although I know he'd never hurt me physically, I he can be very scary and abusive when he's drinking (which he will be). To get away from this is one reason I left him. \n\nHis reasoning is that if I don't go, his parents will figure out we aren't together, & that means I will be responsible for ruining his sister's wedding, & his parents will be rendered so miserable that his mother will resume heavy drinking and probably die because of it, which will also be my fault. He says if I don't go I am selfish and that I will be \"dead to him\" and he will never speak to me again.\n\nI definitely don't want to ruin his sister's wedding or cause his parents any upset, and the kids are now begging me to just go because he has told them their grandma will probably die if I don't. But I also think his demand is unreasonable. We aren't a married couple anymore. I spent our whole marriage complying with his demands because I was afraid of his temper, and I'm trying to to set boundaries and enforce them. But he says (as he always has) that if I don't do as he wants I'm being a selfish asshole. \n\nI offered instead to say I was coming and then pretend to be sick at the last minute. That's still a lie, but a smaller one than going to the wedding and pretending we are still a couple. And even if his parents suspect, it wouldn't make a scene or ruin the wedding.\n\nJeff says this is too much of a risk given his mother's health and his sister's happiness are at stake and so I have to go with him.\n\nAITA for trying to maintain this boundary and refusing to go to my ex-SIL's wedding?", "created_utc": 1677183304, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a7hq6/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_exsil_wedding_as_my/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
