That sucks for everyone involved, but it's not your fault. You don't control the plane schedule, you didn't set the class schedule, and you didn't make your family come with you.

Co dependence that they expected you to buy into? Pffft", "NTA OP. You did not abandon them but you did right going to your destination on time and less stress. Walking out of a flight midway when there are no guarantees is not something to toy with when airlines are still re-adjusting in the midst of a post-pandemic era", "NTA - but you certainly cut it close leaving as late as you did.

Talk about dramatic! NTA", "NTA. The flight ticket and uni tuition are not cheap, you\u2019re well within ur rights to not stay behind with them, when there\u2019s no good reason to.", "i\u2019m honestly shocked by the N T As. I don\u2019t want to pass judgement (if I had to ESH bc the actions of OPs family put his academics in jeopardy) because I don\u2019t think you really understand what this moment means, not only to you, but your family as well. It is very common for your family to move you in, I helped older siblings move into their freshman dorms because it was a way to say goodbye and good luck on their journey to adulthood. While it is understandable that you\u2019d want to make it to your classes, the following day, I think allowing yourself some time to reflect is a good idea. Good luck in college, don\u2019t forget to have fun!", "NTA. College is about you. You're actually attending. You can't be expected to sabotage the thing they're celebrating for them. What on earth are they even celebrating if they expect to you do that other than themselves and their own generosity, not you? How selfish.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d say you made the responsible decision to get to classes on time. Your father could have accompanied you. He chose not to.", "NTA", "NTA.  Based on this behavior does this mean they have a tracking app on your phone and expect to be sent your \u201creport cards\u201d too?

You did the right thing", "NTA first day of classes is really important. You don't want to miss it.", "NTA! You did the responsible reasonable thing.", "You seem a lot more mature than your parents are.  NTAH", "NTA. \u201cMy college is more important then us being on the same flight together. I know you are more than capable of flying without my help.\u201d", "Absolutely, they\u2019re very clingy", "Yes, missing the first class of my college career would not be a good move, so it\u2019s unfortunate but it\u2019s what I had to do.", "Thank you", "No problem. Good luck with school.", "NTA. There was no reason that you should have stressed yourself the night before you start classes and possibly missed them due to an issue which your parents, presumably adults, had to deal with. It was unfortunate but you are out in the world now and need to make sure you prioritize yourself and your schooling unless there is an actual serious emergency.", "Ok but they do understand they can just see you off at any point during your trip? At home when you take a taxi, at the first airport, the 2nd airport ect? They're being super weird. You went to collage, not on a family trip. You had a timed schedule. \n\nThe fact that they expected you to drop you schedule just so they can go on a \"family trip\" to your colleague is ... Weird. NTA", "Esh \nI understand they are upset. But also why did you wait till the day before to move in like this. In general that was kinda irresponsible move in isn't usually the day before especially for freshman like usually it's a week or 4 days before. Because if nothing went smoothly for you you would have missed classes\n\nBut also they way you talk about your family seems off. Do you like them because what they wanted to do is very normal for families to do.", "NTA.\n\n*I had two flights, one to a city in between me and where the college is, and the second one to the city where my college is*\n\nSo... a connecting flight. \n\nIt doesn't sound like your family knows how to travel?", "Nta", "Your family is weird , NTA", "NTA, being there for classes is more important than sentimental bs.", "I mean...you'd think it's a joke but as someone who worked a low level office pushy job in university for a bit, you'd be *amazed* at the amount of parents who had to be told they weren't actually entitled to receive their child's report cards anymore and they'd have to ask their kid for permission if it was *that* important to them.", "Lower division classes when I was an undergrad regularly dropped people who didn\u2019t show to the first day from class. Don\u2019t miss it.", "Yeah...I remember one of the core classes my freshman year of college regularly had a *huge* line of waitlisted students waiting outside on the first day of class, because the professor was notorious for being *ruthless* about removing no-shows.", "NTA you can't miss your first classes"]}
