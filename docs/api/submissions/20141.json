Every other living creature on the planet does this.", "Couple of thoughts:\n\nGenerally speaking I sympathise with avoiding AC usage. AC units use a lot of power. In the interest of saving money and energy resources, they should be used as little as possible.\n\nFurthermore, even if you use AC, expecting to always maintain 68 at night in the summer is ridiculous. If you can\u2019t catch sleep over 68 degrees, you need to work on yourself.\nThat\u2019s not to say that >80 degrees is a pleasant temperature to sleep, I hate that too.\n\nUltimately, I\u2019d say NTA anyway:\n\nIt\u2019s the night ahead of your finals, I\u2018d have trouble sleeping even if the room temperature is nice and chilly.

With some words about how you appreciate everything he does to support you.  (Don't just throw it in his face in an adversarial fashion).

Makes you very very clearly NTA", "I get that, I much prefer a cold environment to sleep too. 68 degrees is an unreasonable expectation nevertheless.\n\nThe power it takes to cool a room is not linear, it takes more and more energy to cool a room with every degree. \n\nAlso, often it\u2019s not so much the actual temperature that matters, but the difference to the outside. If it\u2019s 100 degrees outside, a room temperature in the mid 70s might actually feel very cool.", "Well shiiiiit! You pops gotta learn to chill on your dollar then!
