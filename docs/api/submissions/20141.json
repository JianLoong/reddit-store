Otherwise what was the point of getting it for you? Your dad might be worried about the electric bill so maybe discuss that with him and offer to contribute. 80 degrees is way to hot to sleep comfortably! Just because your dad is fine at that temperature doesn't mean you are.", "Honestly? NTA. I was miserable for years at home because of how warm my house growing up was kept in the summer. I didn\u2019t complain because they were paying the bills, but I would bring cups of ice to bed to try and cool off with to hope to sleep. Doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ve had life long insomnia as well. \n\nI will say you should offer to kick in for utilities if possible to curtail objections. It IS expensive.

That's a pretty Dad thing, lol. \n\nTry showing your father exactly how hot your room is at night, (quite often one side of a house will be a lot warmer than the other) and if you can, maybe offer to pay a bit towards the hydro bill for the next two months. \n\nIt is almost impossible to sleep whilst hot so I have a lot of sympathy for you. \n\nNTA.

If he gave you an air conditioner as a present, then he should expect you to use it.\n\nIf you bought it yourself, that would be a different story.\n\nIn any case, this is why adult children should move out of their parent's house. Every other living creature on the planet does this.", "Couple of thoughts:\n\nGenerally speaking I sympathise with avoiding AC usage. AC units use a lot of power. In the interest of saving money and energy resources, they should be used as little as possible.\n\nFurthermore, even if you use AC, expecting to always maintain 68 at night in the summer is ridiculous. If you can\u2019t catch sleep over 68 degrees, you need to work on yourself.\nThat\u2019s not to say that >80 degrees is a pleasant temperature to sleep, I hate that too.\n\nUltimately, I\u2019d say NTA anyway:\n\nIt\u2019s the night ahead of your finals, I\u2018d have trouble sleeping even if the room temperature is nice and chilly. You have more important things to worry about than the energy bill.\n\nAlso why buy an AC, if you\u2019re not supposed to use it.", "ESH\n\nYou knew he would get mad. He got mad.

And I live in Ontario - let's not even START with the winter heating..... My husband is around 200lbs and my daughter is about half that. She's always freezing, he's always saying, \"just wear a sweater!\".... arrrragh!", "The thing is, I offered to pay for the energy I used, and he wouldn't let me.

By offering to pay, you are actually shifting the power balance and becoming an equal adult in the negotiation, instead of being a child/subordinate.  So it's a double-whammy!\n\nOk - here's another possibility. IF you have a bit of spare money, put a specific amount in an envelope and offer it to your Dad.  With some words about how you appreciate everything he does to support you.  (Don't just throw it in his face in an adversarial fashion). If he STILL says no, well, then you can run the AC at night guilt-free and ignore his griping. \n\nDon't feel bad OP. Good sleep is super super important to teens and young adults!!!", "Okay, that's more than fair. I maintain my NTA.", "Edit your post to add this fact. Makes you very very clearly NTA", "I get that, I much prefer a cold environment to sleep too. 68 degrees is an unreasonable expectation nevertheless.\n\nThe power it takes to cool a room is not linear, it takes more and more energy to cool a room with every degree. \n\nAlso, often it\u2019s not so much the actual temperature that matters, but the difference to the outside. If it\u2019s 100 degrees outside, a room temperature in the mid 70s might actually feel very cool.", "Well shiiiiit! You pops gotta learn to chill on your dollar then!

You don't think that's a bit extreme?", "I legitimately can't understand why someone would still decline after I offer them money. They literally have nothing to lose.", "Will do.", "Yeah, I know that 68 is a little unreasonable for most people. So I offered to pay for the energy I used. He still declined.", "Nope not at all.
