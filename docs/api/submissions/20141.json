I even said I would pay but he refused to let me pay and refuse to turn on the heat. He thought he could throw a light blanket over it to keep it warm... WTF. And I could not convince him that throwing a blanket over it does basically nothing because unlike a human body, a piano doesn't generate it's own heat. The piano was always horribly out of tune and the action was warped due to this. \n\nMy point being, for some people it isn't about being right or wrong or even fairly compensated. It's a power/pride thing thinking they know what's best and they'll be damned if they let their child tell them what to do.

Look at herds of feral horses, wolf packs, lion prides, chimps and bonobos - many offspring will continue to live in the same group as their parents well into adulthood or even all their lives. Adult offspring will help with stuff like hunting/finding food, defending the group and looking after their younger siblings until it's their turn to have their own babies.\n\nIn humans too, expecting offspring to leave their parents as soon as they turn 18 is a very modern and Western obsession. Throughout most of history, and to this day in most parts of the world, it's completely normal for adults to live with their parents at least until they marry, if not beyond, and living in a multi-generational household has a lot of advantages when it comes to things like pooling resources and sharing labour like housework and childcare.
