Then, when she would tell my sister, her GC, that time never worked for her and they would change it and \"forget\" to tell me.  I would often find out the morning of.  I let this go on waaaay too long.  My husband didn't get to have a holiday celebration with his family (unless there was a lot of logistical re-planning which wasn't always possible) for 20 years.  The straw that broke the camel's back was Thanksgiving several years ago.  I was making the turkey for a 6pm dinner.  Mom called at noon, upset, because everyone else showed up for an 1130 lunch.  I hung up on her.  I was done.  I stopped worrying about my parents/family.  We did our thing and did holidays with his family. Holidays stopped being stressful.  I highly recommend it.\n\nSupport your wife and stop letting your mom control holidays.  You are NTA", "You're certainly NTA for not wanting to eat Thanksgiving dinner without your wife.

Until they treat her with some respect, you need to quit acting like they might maybe possibly could be making simple mistakes. \n\nThe longer you let this go without standing up for her, the more your wife sees you not standing up for her.
