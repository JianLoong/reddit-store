They're not civil to your wife at all.  This is completely deliberate.", "My mom used to do that with me.  My husband worked rotating shifts and we had holidays with his family as well as one with our kids.  Mom would commit to a date/time with me, and I would schedule everything around this.  Then, when she would tell my sister, her GC, that time never worked for her and they would change it and \"forget\" to tell me.  I would often find out the morning of.  I let this go on waaaay too long.  My husband didn't get to have a holiday celebration with his family (unless there was a lot of logistical re-planning which wasn't always possible) for 20 years.  The straw that broke the camel's back was Thanksgiving several years ago.  I was making the turkey for a 6pm dinner.  Mom called at noon, upset, because everyone else showed up for an 1130 lunch.  I hung up on her.  I was done.  I stopped worrying about my parents/family.  We did our thing and did holidays with his family. Holidays stopped being stressful.  I highly recommend it.\n\nSupport your wife and stop letting your mom control holidays.  You are NTA", "You're certainly NTA for not wanting to eat Thanksgiving dinner without your wife. She doesn't get off work until the evening, and you want to eat then. If you'd rather eat a proper meal than reheat whatever the rest of your family didn't eat, it's quite reasonable for the two of you to prefer to have a thanksgiving dinner of your own.\n\nBut does your wife work all the holidays? If she does, then at some point you're probably going to need to eat a family meal without her.", "NTA.", "NTA", "No but mom blew this one", "You're NTA. Good for you for standing by your wife against that rude nonsense.", "NTA.  Your mother knows exactly what she's doing.  I find that rude and disrespectful.

Let religious mom know you are not playing her passive aggressive games and go when your wife is available or don\u2019t go at all.  Me, I would go just for the free food. If she did it at Easter, it\u2019s not a mistake.", "NTA. She is intentionally doing this. It's not okay. Her backpeddling and the failure to take personal responsibility in this is not okay. What was totally okay was for you to call them on the carpet for it and then say thanks but no thanks.", "NTA, she never intended to change the time.", "NTA. I\u2019d just go lc to nc.", "Just trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately they have shown me too many times. Hard to let go. I\u2019m not going, didn\u2019t wanna do that to my wife.", "What I mean by civil is they don\u2019t rip her apart. Which I realize is a really low bar.  Her parents also didn\u2019t go but we have a relationship with them. We both agreed it\u2019s better to just accept that they don\u2019t accept and still have them in our life, regardless of how much they have hurt us.

That\u2019s usually a reasonable time but my parents eat dinner so early.", "Why give them the benefit of the doubt? They\u2019ve already proven they\u2019re homophobic.

They don\u2019t support your relationship. They wouldn\u2019t even come to your wedding. They lie about plans to accommodate you and your wife, then when caught, say, \u201coops. We forgot. Oh well!\u201d \n\nYou don\u2019t want to admit that they are rude and disrespectful because if you admit that, then you will be forced to take action. And that action will either be in support of your wife, or in support of your parents. It\u2019s time to pick where your loyalties are, and set some actual boundaries. Ones that start with your parents apologizing to your wife, showing contrition for their rudeness, and honestly welcoming your wife to the family. Until they treat her with some respect, you need to quit acting like they might maybe possibly could be making simple mistakes. \n\nThe longer you let this go without standing up for her, the more your wife sees you not standing up for her. Think about how that looks. Watching the person you married not stand up for you. Over and over.\n\nEdited because I screwed up OP\u2019s gender. Terribly sorry. Thanks for the correction.", "The doubt should have been eliminated by now.  Every time you give in just makes it easier for them to do this again.

I would say that it sounds intentional based on the previous occasion. Or, it could be the onset of dementia.
