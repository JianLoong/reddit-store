Her family had little to do with her, especially her younger sister, Cin.\n\nMy parents were married for 39 years, together for 40. My father was devastated when losing my mother. Yet, once the holidays went by he started to perk up. Part of that was in part due to visiting my 80 year old grandmother regularly. Who lives with grandma, you ask? Cin, of course. \n\nA little background on Cin. She is a narcisstic human with intentions that serve literally only her. She will make money by suing for random bs at hospitals. She also has been cut on like a Thanksgiving turkey because of Munchausen syndrome. She virtually never spoke to my mother unless she was asking for money or fighting over something petty. \n\nMy father, lonely and apparently having lost his damn mind, has been taking care of Cin. They have been carrying on a relationship. My siblings and I are all uncomfortable with this situation. She had nothing to do with us then my mother dies and suddenly she is glued to my father's ass. But I digress. What he does with his penis is none of my business.\n\nMy son, Luke, is 6 and very close with my father. He usually spends every other weekend with my dad, which is great. That is not the issue. The issue is that back in March Cin told someone (in front of me) that Luke is now her \"pseudograndson\" and laughed because he started calling her Nana. \n\nNo. His Nana died and this woman is legitimately confusing my grieving child. On purpose. I told my dad Luke is not to be around her as frequently anymore. He said okay and Luke was supposed to be visiting my dad at my sister's house, where my father has been staying.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, Luke has been over at the trailer with Cin. Keep in mind, the trailer was my parents trailer until my father gave it to Cin and Grandma to live in. So, Luke sees Cin in my mother's spot on the bed and, again, gets confused because he's little and doesn't understand. \n\nI get upset but I try to just let it ride because I don't want to stress out my father or ruin his relationship with Luke. But now Cin, who can barely walk and often has bowel issues that lead to accidents (just to highlight her self inflicted poor health) wants to drive my child 30 minutes away to a birthday party without my father present. \n\nI said no. I also explained that, despite my silence, I am in no way comfortable with this situation. I told her that my father is free to carry on with her as he likes because he is a grown man but I do not feel my child is in a psychologically safe and healthy environment. I told her that prior to my mother's death he had no idea who she was and that he is not a toy. The fact she made zero efforts to have a relationship with him (or any of us) prior to my mother's death makes me uncomfortable. And that I'm not okay with them including my child in their whatever the hell it is. \n\nAITA for cutting her off from my child?

Cin is toxic and damaging and you know it. Why are you allowing her access to your son at all? If your dad wants to visit with him it needs to happen at your house. He\u2019s already shown he isn\u2019t trustworthy by allowing Cin to continue to be around your son despite you voicing your objections. If your sister knew your dad was taking Luke to the trailer and not staying to visit at her house, you can\u2019t trust her to protect Luke either. It\u2019s YOUR job to protect your son. Do your job.", "NTA. Your father should only have supervised visitation with your son. And I don\u2019t mean supervised by your sister.", "NTA\nCin sounds crazy and manipulative and your father is blinded by grief. Don't allow any unsupervised contact between your son and dad. This is so damaging and confusing situation for your son. Your father's judgement can't be trusted and he'll just allow Cin around Luke without telling you.\n\nYour sister isn't trustworthy either, I don't understand why she let it happen. At this point I would allow only supervised contact in my own house and if grandpa doesn't like it then he can have no contact at all.", "Sounds like Cin's name was spelt wrong with the first letter but still phonetically correct.

I could see her showing up with the child, complaining that mom is dropping the kid off for her to take care of when she has all these medical problems. This would make mom the bad guy, and give her a whole new audience for her medical drama. NTA\n\nShe probably won't do anything directly to the kid, because she is not close enough to gain sympathy points for caring for a sick child, and she could lose access to her brother in law and his help and sympathy if she did. Mom would instantly be suspicious if something happened- illness or injury, and would seek medical diagnosis. This could get her charged with a crime. I suspect that any illness or injury would end with her cutting off her father from his grandchild until he stopped interacting with Cin. Even if it was not caused by Cin, the stress of worrying about this will soon be too much and grandpa will have to only see his grandson at his daughters home.", "NTA.

Your dad can't be trusted to make good decisions right now. Keep your son close.", "NTA she sounds like a nightmare. \n\nBut, I think you are underestimating the intelligence of your child.
