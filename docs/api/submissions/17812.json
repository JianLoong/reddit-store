Her family had little to do with her, especially her younger sister, Cin.\n\nMy parents were married for 39 years, together for 40. My father was devastated when losing my mother. Yet, once the holidays went by he started to perk up. Part of that was in part due to visiting my 80 year old grandmother regularly. Who lives with grandma, you ask? Cin, of course. \n\nA little background on Cin. She is a narcisstic human with intentions that serve literally only her. She will make money by suing for random bs at hospitals. She also has been cut on like a Thanksgiving turkey because of Munchausen syndrome. She virtually never spoke to my mother unless she was asking for money or fighting over something petty. \n\nMy father, lonely and apparently having lost his damn mind, has been taking care of Cin. They have been carrying on a relationship. My siblings and I are all uncomfortable with this situation. She had nothing to do with us then my mother dies and suddenly she is glued to my father's ass. But I digress. What he does with his penis is none of my business.\n\nMy son, Luke, is 6 and very close with my father. He usually spends every other weekend with my dad, which is great. That is not the issue. The issue is that back in March Cin told someone (in front of me) that Luke is now her \"pseudograndson\" and laughed because he started calling her Nana. \n\nNo. His Nana died and this woman is legitimately confusing my grieving child. On purpose. I told my dad Luke is not to be around her as frequently anymore. He said okay and Luke was supposed to be visiting my dad at my sister's house, where my father has been staying.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, Luke has been over at the trailer with Cin. Keep in mind, the trailer was my parents trailer until my father gave it to Cin and Grandma to live in. So, Luke sees Cin in my mother's spot on the bed and, again, gets confused because he's little and doesn't understand. \n\nI get upset but I try to just let it ride because I don't want to stress out my father or ruin his relationship with Luke. But now Cin, who can barely walk and often has bowel issues that lead to accidents (just to highlight her self inflicted poor health) wants to drive my child 30 minutes away to a birthday party without my father present. \n\nI said no. I also explained that, despite my silence, I am in no way comfortable with this situation. I told her that my father is free to carry on with her as he likes because he is a grown man but I do not feel my child is in a psychologically safe and healthy environment. I told her that prior to my mother's death he had no idea who she was and that he is not a toy. The fact she made zero efforts to have a relationship with him (or any of us) prior to my mother's death makes me uncomfortable. And that I'm not okay with them including my child in their whatever the hell it is. \n\nAITA for cutting her off from my child?

Do whatever you need to do to take care of yourself and your son and don\u2019t feel bad about having boundaries.", "NTA! I'd be suspicious of Cin as well.  That's really weird that she's essentially playing pretend with your son.  It seems like she wanted what your mom had and is seizing the opportunity. She sounds extremely toxic and I wouldn't want my child anywhere near this  person.  Keep your son safe and maintain boundaries with Cin.\n\n*also, I'm so sorry for your loss.

Take your son, give your father an ultimatum", "NTA. Also, talk with your son as well, help him understand the situation. He's 6, at that age kids are already old enough to understand the situation.
