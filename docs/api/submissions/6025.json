He taught me how to write, ball a fist, to ride a bike, and the list goes on.  Now, that's not to say we weren't without our problems.  He was a recovering addict who relapsed a lot.

Cycles of us talking and not talking. He relapsed in spring and we were an cycle of not talking, but he recently got sober. We had a discussion that we were going to meet up and talk. I was ready to form a relationship again. He was really happy to get his family back.  Him and my mom were doing good.  He really seemed to be doing a whole lot better. \n\nCurrent: My dad overdosed and died  on Christmas Eve leaving behind a wife and five children.

Regardless of how THEY feel about your relationship with him, you are allowed to grieve. And your husband is doing what is right and helping you through this\n\nIn my family, we understand that the holiday is not the date, but the day you get together as family. This stickler shit of \u201cbe here on the holiday or you don\u2019t love us\u201d is manipulative and just plain mean. You need time to grieve and you need your husband to help you through it. You\u2019ll be there next year and you will hang out later when you feel able. \n\nHis family can lick ants.", "NTA \n\nYour dad just passed away and they're concerned about not \"getting a refund on the thing's they bought\".\n\nProps to your husband for sticking up for you. Def NTA, but i'd go NC with the parents they clearly don't seem to care about you.", "NTA\n\nFirst, I'm so sorry for your loss. When I got the call my dad died...it's just bad and yanks the rug right out from under you.\n\nI cannot comprehend that his family is acting this way. There was a death in your immediate family, of course that comes first. They are being so selfish and unreasonable, it's mind boggling that they think him going to a family dinner, even for Christmas, is more important. I'm so glad he's standing his ground, he sounds awesome (like my husband lol). \n\nAgain, I'm so sorry for your loss.", "Wow NTA, not even remotely close.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss. His family behaving the way they are is disgusting.", "NTA. What else is there to say. It doesn't actually matter why you needed him. Could be anything, but the point is you needed him and he was there for you as a real partner should be. If they don't get that, their problem.", "NTA!\n\n'El' is amazing! You have a wonderful husband. His family should be proud of the man they raised.\n\nFocus on your family and everyone dealing with the grieving process. Let your husband be the wonderful rock he is, and let him deal with his family. When you are in a better place, take some well-deserved time for both of you to spoil and just enjoy each other.\n\nWhatever his family's disappointments in his absence this Christmas or in having even less of a relationship with him in the future (if they push too hard) are their problem and stem from their lack of compassion.", "NTA - death in the family, especially of a parent, trumps Christmas dinner to every sane person that I know. For them to want \"just an hour\" in the midst of that shows exactly what type of person they are.\n\nSo sorry to hear about your loss, especially during the holidays.", "NTA I am so sorry about your stepdad. I am not sorry you have a husband who loves you and seems like a truly decent person.", "NTA. \n\nYour father died, regardless of whether you had ups and downs that\u2019s huge. Your husband and you are doing the right thing.\n\nHis family on the other hand, wow. This has probably been an eye opener for him as to what kind of people his family actually are. Going LC is probably the best option.", "NTA: Your *dad* died. Regardless of the rocky relationship, this is a big deal. You have a lot of feelings to deal with and you need your husband to be there supporting you.\n\nBig hugs to you and your husband for all you're going through.\n\nHis family is insane though. They have no regard for your feelings. They can't do without him for one holiday because of a *death in the family.* I can't believe that has to be emphasized. A death in the family. Whatever he said to them they deserved.", "NTA, your husband sounds amazing and best of luck with your inlaws.", "NTA\n\nHoly fuck what the shit is wrong with his family? Obviously when your wife's dad fucking dies you are going to be dealing with that rather than attending a Christmas dinner. They are completely out of line.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss, at any time of year, but especially now. \n\nAlso. \n\nYour husband is a goddamn delight & doing exactly what anyone would want from a partner given what you're going through.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nI assume you included your father\u2019s history to give the readers your in-laws\u2019 perspective that he was \u201cless\u201d because of his addiction. But anyone who has loved someone who struggles with addiction (and that seems to be practically everyone) knows these people are as loved and valued as anyone else. Your loss was devastating and your husband needed to be with you. El sounds like a great husband and person.", "NTA. First of all, I am so sorry, especially since this had to happen now. \n\nAs to this situation: your husband\u2019s family is being stunningly selfish. You are going through a traumatic event with the death of a loved one, and they are worried about being able to get a refund? \n\nI don\u2019t know what your relationship was with your in-laws before this, but they have now revealed themselves to be entirely self-centered and selfish people, not willing to give up one night of a celebration they have every year for an emergency that you just had. And then for them to keep on your husband afterwards - they are truly shallow, horrible people. \n\nYou and your husband have nothing to feel guilty about or to apologize for. His family, on the other hand, need to be on their knees apologizing to the two of you.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. He was your dad, and even though it wasn\u2019t a perfect relationship, no relationship is. Your partner is doing an amazing job of supporting you and I\u2019m going to guess also shielding you from their real comments. \n\nAs for his family, I think it goes without saying they are complete assholes. Who hears about a death and thinks about themselves? The presents? And not only that but launches into arguments about how they need your partner more than you do. The fact that they are continuing long after the holiday is outrageous. I feel for you for having lost your father and your partner for realizing just how shitty his really family is.", "NTA. I am so incredibly sorry. Losing someone is always hard, but the way and timing make it so much worse for those left behind. My condolences for your loss. \n\nYou had it exactly right. The only response is, \"I am so sorry. Go take care of things, we love you, we are here if you need us.\" Period. He just died and they want an hour right this minute? That is much less reasonable. Your husband sounds like a very good man.", "You're NTA and you know it.\n\nAnother one that's so obvious I don't understand why people even ask.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They might not believe it, but he's an incredibly good son / grandson /etc.\n\nYou are NTA for wanting and needing your husband by your side once you got the news about your dad. Don't even think of criticizing yourself over this.\n\nTwo main comments:\n\n1 - Given how they are behaving, he should not reward their bad behavior by cooking them dinner and spending time with them. Their days of nasty comments should have consequences.\n\n2- Expect them to hold grudges forever and bring this up in spiteful ways in perpetuity. When someone from their family dies, for example, they may expect you to immediately place yourself at their beck and call.

I'm guessing his family has the unconscious privilege of people who haven't been through divorces and losses and blended families because (to most of us) Christmas is the day everyone can get off work and has custody of their kids. \n\nI'm sorry about your dad. I lost my dad this year and had a rough Christmas, I couldn't imagine having both at the same time.\n\nA friend of mine lost her mom at Christmas and now they celebrate the shit out of groundhogs day (big dinner, gifts, movie night, family time) because no one is sad in February.

I am so sorry both sides of his family turned out to be horrible people! I know his family has traditions, but traditions are supposed to be fun, they aren't supposed to be chains that keep you in a stranglehold, that you absolutely must adhere to no matter what.\n\nI wish you the best in dealing with your father's passing!", "He wasn't.  They went out for dinner and then his immediate family was going to go back for Christmas presents and coffee."]}
