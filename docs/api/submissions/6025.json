There was a death in your immediate family, of course that comes first.

First of all, I am so sorry, especially since this had to happen now. \n\nAs to this situation: your husband\u2019s family is being stunningly selfish.

His family, on the other hand, need to be on their knees apologizing to the two of you.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. He was your dad, and even though it wasn\u2019t a perfect relationship, no relationship is. Your partner is doing an amazing job of supporting you and I\u2019m going to guess also shielding you from their real comments. \n\nAs for his family, I think it goes without saying they are complete assholes. Who hears about a death and thinks about themselves? The presents? And not only that but launches into arguments about how they need your partner more than you do. The fact that they are continuing long after the holiday is outrageous. I feel for you for having lost your father and your partner for realizing just how shitty his really family is.", "NTA. I am so incredibly sorry. Losing someone is always hard, but the way and timing make it so much worse for those left behind. My condolences for your loss. \n\nYou had it exactly right.
