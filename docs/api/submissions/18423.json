Even if I could put it all in a Uhaul van in one trip, he still refuses to let anyone help me, even if my fianc\u00e9 was not the person helping (who would love to help if allowed).

OP needs to call for a police escort. If legally the items are hers and her husband is keeping her from getting them, the police can go supervise.

Plus she\u2019s had 2 years to get a u haul and get her things, especially if they were that important, but again, there could be a valid reason for him being that way.. maybe she has bad friends and he doesn\u2019t want them around.. we don\u2019t really know.. just that her side of the story of course makes him look like a dick, buuuuuutttt\u2026", "Go back to court.

It is way more likely that HE is the one dragging it out because he can. \n\nShe absoloutely needs to get the cops/lawyers involved to get her stuff back. Her lawyer dropped the ball on this during the divorce, but she needs to take ownership of the situation and get it sorted out.", "he\u2019s not allowing her to have anyone help her and she\u2019s pregnant that\u2019s extremely unsafe for her", "Yeah, let's have randos trespass on his property and in his home!

The fact is she\u2019s had 2 years to get her things and the smart thing to do would have been getting a uhaul 2 years ago instead of taking this long to get her things, her ex is a dick.. for that dumb rule, but, there\u2019s 2 sides to every story\u2026 there\u2019s possibly a reason why he\u2019s being a dick\u2026 Who knows.. maybe she cheated and hence the divorce and his rule.. who knows. Maybe she has shitty friends\u2026.and he doesn\u2019t want them on the property.. She\u2019s had plenty of time though.

Also, usually in a divorce, doesn\u2019t the house get sold and money divided between them if they can\u2019t agree on who gets it?

She\u2019s using her pregnancy now to get sympathy on her and sway the votes her way. It worked with you but not with most on here. 2 years.. at any time in that 2 years on a \u201capproved date\u201d.. she could have gotten a pull behind uhaul even.. at least anyone with common sense knows that.

I'm not sure that legally it's even hers anymore, especially depending on the jurisdiction", "A judge would take a literal crap over all of this \u201cyou can\u2019t have help\u201d garbage on the ex-husbands side. If someone had stuff that I valued I would have retrieved that stuff immediately. And if it meant that I had to go back to court to make it happen I would have. This isn\u2019t a difficult pro-se argument to make. If she was awarded the stuff in the divorce he doesn\u2019t get to dictate that she can\u2019t have help. The law doesn\u2019t work that way. He can add whatever \u201ccondition\u201d he wants, but he would get slapped around by a judge and be forced to pay her legal fees in most instances.  She should have filed a motion to enforce the agreement, rented a truck, gathered some friends, and got her stuff out the door.", "That would make sense but I still feel like it would be questioned on why she's waited two years to take proper action", "I have a feeling we\u2019re not hearing the whole story here.", "It might be questioned, but if she can show that she's been reasonably trying to get it during this time, and that he has been refusing her or making it impossible, then her property is clearly not abandoned and it could be considered theft.\n\nEx husband sounds like an asshole, not wanting to rock the boat when dealing with a manipulative asshole will not be new to the cops or the court.", "YTA.\n\nIt's been two freaking years.  Uhaul + 2 movers + nearby storage building and you'll be out in a couple hours.  Yes, I know he doesn't want \"anyone else there\", but I'm sure a judge could write into the divorce decree that you can use reasonable assistance for a short period of time to remove agreed upon belongings from the residence.  Once it's stored nearby, you can go through it at your leisure or have it all moved again to wherever you relocated to.  \n\nThis is just silly.", "NTA and you know who you can call to retrieve your property from someone else's property.

With the help you need to get it.", "this is NUTS go to a local police station tell them everything explain youre preggo and have an escort!! make sure an officer comes w you cause i have a feeling he wouldnt be chill if you just said the police was okay. im sorry youre dealing w such a prick, hopefully if you do an escort you can finally be done w his whole thing", "NTA, I don't think he can legally withhold your property from you? Call the police and ask for a cop to escort you if you don't feel safe. Good job getting tf out of there", "NTA... get legal help, this is a control play, nothing else", "Agreed! OP, law enforcement should be able to help you get your stuff. Don\u2019t go alone. He\u2019s being ridiculous.", "Probably because he wants to still have access to her. And control.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she was allowed help to load things up then either. Lots of people aren\u2019t strong enough to load a full u haul on their own without any help which is a completely BS rule. A lot of furniture simply requires two people to move. She should be allowed movers and should get cops to supervise this toxic/abusive ex.", "And bring three or four big guys to move your belongings outside of the house as fast as possible so you don\u2019t hold up the police. They usually can\u2019t stay too long.", "After two yrs, he could have thrown her legally abandoned things into the trash. Officer won't do shit, she hasn't been a resident there in 2 yrs and he hasn't stolen anything from her. She could have gotten a U-haul yrs ago. Two years is preposterous.", "Often you don\u2019t even need the court. \n\nIN the US, You just call the sheriff or local PD and ask for a \u201cCivil Standby\u201d \n\n\nThey don\u2019t help you, but they make sure you can access and get your stuff and the ex won\u2019t interfere. OP should call the local law enforcement and ask what their process for a civil standby (or equivalent) is. And she may even be able to bring someone to help her (though she shouldn\u2019t bring the fiance that might start too much trouble).", "She 100% could have asked to be allowed to hire professional movers in the divorce settlement or hearing and it probably would have been granted. She didn't so here she is. \n\nBTW, in a lot of locations the police no longer participate in civil stand-bys and when they do it isn't like everyone on here keeps commenting. They give a short period of time, usually under an hour, and it is for moving what you can in that time and no, they don't allow just anyone to come with you or go against the homeowner in that regard. The police don't stand around for hours on end while the person moves their furniture. \n\nIf the OP is serious she can take it back to court and ask to be allowed to remove the rest with professional movers. Or she can ask to pay for him to move it into storage. Or she can sell it or ask for the value of the items. She has options. \n\nWe don't know that the ex is abusive or even toxic. It has been two years so for two years he has stored all of the OP's crap while she takes it one car load at a time. Now she is asking him for another year. We have no idea why he doesn't want her friends or family in his home.", "Sounds like OP could have simply rented a U-haul for the first \"agreed upon date\", yrs ago. At 2 yrs, this is a her problem.", "She has had 2 yrs, not pregnant, to figure shit out. If she knows her ex is unreasonable (and I'm not convinced he is ) then take some damn initiative and get a U-haul. 2 yrs is ridiculous,  at this point, it her fault.", "Or a judge could ask her why it took two damn yrs for her to get her head out of her ass and rent a U-haul. A judge could also go by the letter of the law and decide her shit is considered abandoned,  since she didn't take the initiative to retrieve it sooner. Take a U-haul on the first agreed upon date, done - don't drag it out for 2 yrs."]}
