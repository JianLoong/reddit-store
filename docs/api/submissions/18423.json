At this point the remaining belongings are most likely considered his property", "Of course not.\n\nHowever, when someone is being hostile and not following a court order of a divorce? Yes.\n\nHis ex isn\u2019t a stranger. His ex bringing help wouldn\u2019t constitute strangers. Cmon now.", "How many Saturdays do you think it would take? Is she just picking up a carrier bag at a time or something?\n\nIt sounds more like she's the one dragging it out to me. There's no way it should take longer than a couple of months, and that's if the scheduling is really unlucky.\n\nIf he was denying her access for months, she needed to contact the police.", "Yeah, no, that\u2019s not how it works. There\u2019s no \u2018technicality\u2019 that lets someone keep your stuff after moving out. You have the right to retrieve your stuff and have whoever you need to help you. In fact, OP should do this immediately, because in most jurisdictions property left behind becomes the property owners after a certain amount of time. That\u2019s the only technicality I\u2019d be worried about. \n\nCall the non-emergency line and tell the police you need an escort to retrieve your belongings from your previous residence, and they should help you out. Bring a list of your belongings. It would be ideal if it were the court order from the divorce, but at least document what you are going to take. The police will most likely see you are the reasonable one and facilitate. Their priority will be to \u2018keep the peace\u2019 so if you stay calm they\u2019ll probably be on your side the whole time.", "And that's petty as fuck, but it doesn't explain why its taken 2 years.", "The ex isn't preventing her from getting her stuff, though. He's making it hugely impractical, but not impossible.", "He's not preventing her from getting her stuff, he is coordinating reasonable times, and no, he doesn't have to allow random strangers in his house. Her being pregnant is not his problem.", "What aspect of the court order is he not following?\n\nAnd is he being hostile? He's being a dick, but last I checked, that's not illegal.", "Holding on to property post divorce and making it incredibly difficult to get it back is a common tactic of abusive spouses. It is not unheard of for this kind of thing to drag out because the abused spouse doesn't want to risk escalating things or risk the destruction of the property, and the spouse holding onto the property stuffs around with changing the dates and times they are \"available\" for the other person to pick up their property.\n\nIf he wanted the stuff gone, he would make a date, tell her to turn up, allow her to bring someone to help/organise movers, and you're right, it would be done really fast. Over and out, nice and quick for everyone\n\nBut he is *refusing* to allow any of that. He *wants* her to have to travel three states to get to his place, when he allows her to. He *wants* her to have to only take a small amount of her stuff at a time, because then he gets to have more reasons to make her have to come back to get it. He gets to make her *ask* for her property. He *wants* to have her there at his house, alone and without anyone there to help her, support her, or witness any of his behaviour. \n\nSounds like a reach, you might say. But why else would he actively be making it harder for her to remove her belongings from his property? What does he gain from telling her she can't bring anyone to help her, even when she is pregnant? Why isn't he saying \"for the love of god come and get your stuff, I'm home these weekends, bring a truck and whoever you need, but get it out of here\"?\n\nControl. He gets to control her, and control her access to her property. \n\nShe absoloutely needs to contact the police, and get her stuff. No one disagrees with that.", "I read it as one car load a Saturday. Saturday is the only day she can come and get her car load without any help. If he's only allowing one car load a weekend without any help, depending on what type of car she has it could easily be two years.", "She is physically incapable of moving the items herself. She has to be allowed to bring managed labor to do it. Refusing access would be not following a court order.", "Maybe she was the abuser in the relationship, and he wants to take the piss to get back at her some, but she is uno reversoing that control by deliberately dragging her feet and holding the \"if you don't let me come, then I'm calling the police\" threat over him? It's just as likely.\n\nI can't think of any reason why it's taken her 2 years to move out her stuff. Remember, she agreed to the terms initially, so it must've been possible. There's nothing stopping her hiring a van and doing it all in a handful of trips.\n\nIf he was actually abusing her, after 2 years, it'd be easier to just write off whatever is left. At that point, you'd have replaced anything you need, got the really important stuff that can't be replaced, and I can't see her willingly putting herself under her abuser's control. If she was the abuser, he might feel like he can't ditch her stuff or she'd be able to call the police on her.\n\nSeriously, though, what do you think the police are going to do? Do you think they'll get a warrant to access his property without his permission and bring moving people?", "Van hires exist, or she could ask a friend to help her with driving. The ex can stop someone coming on his property, but he can't stop them from being on the road outside or her collecting her stuff.\n\nHe didn't place a pregnant woman in an unsafe situation. She waited 2 years until she was pregnant to try and manipulate internet strangers with her sob story.", "I don't see one car load being a limiting factor she's mentioned anywhere. I don't see any reason she can't hire a van either.\n\nAlso, he can stop her from bringing anyone onto his property, but he can't deny her having help once the stuff leaves his property (I.e. loading it into a van).\n\nIf he's denying her reasonable access to her property  for 2 years, she should've been in contact with the police long ago. I think she's missing information in her post.", "It isn't every saturday, only the saturdays he gives permission for. \n\nPretty easy for him to say \"you can come next month to get things\" and then next month \"oh sorry, busy/got work/out of town, how about in another 4 weeks instead\" and so on.", "Where does she say she's physically incapable of moving the items? Especially before she vecame pregnant, which was over 18 months afyrt the agreement was made. She doesn't have to be allowed anything beyond what was agreed between her and her ex.\n\nHe hasn't refused access to her at all (beyond what's reasonable, if he has plans for a Saturday, it's fair to deny her access to his house so long as it's not every time). He's refusing to allow her to bring help, which is shitty, but not illegal.\n\nI haven't seen OP say anything that her ex has done that's breaking the agreement that they both made.", "Seriously? \"After our divorce, my ex will only allow me to pick up my stuff on days he approves of, and I have to be alone when I do it\" and you can't imagine how that could stretch out to take two years?\n\nAll he has to do is refuse her access. \"Sorry, busy this month\". \"I'm home tomorrow, you can come then. Oh, you've got work and can't drive three states? That's your problem, not mine.\" \"Can't do it this weekend after all, maybe next time\". \"Oh, you want to hire a truck and pick it all up at once? Sure, I'll see when I'm free and get back to you. Remember you have to do it alone. Oh, you can't drive that truck yourself? Too bad.\" \"I know I have your grandparent's wedding china here, you should definitely come get that soon. Not this month though.\" \n\nAdd in the very very common increase in shitty behaviour from abusive exes when their ex-spouse starts dating someone else, or is pregnant with someone else, and yeah, that bullshittery can drag out even further because now he's pissed she moved on with someone else. \n\nThat is one very obvious reason why it could take someone 2 years to get their stuff back. And ridiculously easy to think of, because it's not uncommon at all.\n\nAgreeing to those kinds of terms may have been her only option. And you're right, she may have thought it was possible, or at least tolerable, then. But it isn't possible now. \n\nNow, her ex is *still* restricting her access to pick up her stuff, and *still* insisting she do it alone even though it will be increasingly risky for her to do so (even with a truck or a van). Neither of those are the usual behaviours of someone who was the abused spouse. Usually they want their abuser out of their life asap, so he would be more likely to want to get her stuff off his property fast and never engage with her again. Not drag it out for two years for some dubious \"fuck you\" moment.\n\nIf her property was granted to her in the divorce, and he is refusing to allow reasonable access to her to get it, then yeah, there can be legal processes to make that happen. I don't know the laws where she is, which is why she needs to talk to the police.\n\nEither way, wanting to have help to go get her stuff? She's not the asshole for that.", "How are you going to get the stuff into the van? She does mention furniture. How big is this furniture? Where is it located? Example: You got a dresser on the second floor and no one is allowed to help get that out of the house and into the van. We don't know where in his house her stuff is located.  There are many scenarios that can contribute to the time spent getting the shit back. I also wouldn't put it past the husband to put her stuff in the hardest to reach areas of his home to be a petty betty but that's me reading into something thats not there. If he really   wanted her stuff gone he would be helping get it out. \n\nI don't disagree that police or what have you should have been called awhile ago though. This whole scenario is ridiculous.", "If there's things that she physically can't move on her own, why did she agree to that rule? What does she think waiting longer will achieve? She would have mentioned that in the OP. It makes no sense, and I feel like there's information being missed out.\n\nThe police should only have been called if he's breaking the law, and it sounds like he's being difficult but within his legal rights."]}
