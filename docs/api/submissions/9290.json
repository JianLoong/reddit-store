It is good that know her mom will cause problems in your relationship with your wife. And i agree with her not living with you.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a good conversation to have, and it's best to have expectations laid out up front.

NTA, OP.", "NTA You may need to ask why she is so set on moving family to live with you. It is usually only done if family is in financial distress, or you really need childcare, or they really need physical help and care. Family puts a great deal of strain on family. It would be better to keep it as a guest suite open for all family and friends to visit a couple weeks at a time, or to make it into a rental.", "NTA.

And I backed it up with contingencies like financial support. She thinks I hate her, which isn\u2019t true.

No. Why would her parents even be interested?", "Fun story time:\n\nMy cousin and his wife live in a nice house with their two kids. Cousin\u2019s in laws bought the plot and built a house so they could move in *next door.*\n\nAt first they were excited. They figured it would be easy for child care, they could just drop the kids off or send them next door! Or grandma and grandpa can just walk over and watch them! Kids can go right to grandma and grandpa\u2019s house when they get off the bus! Think of how great it will be!\n\nRon Howard Narrator: It was not great.\n\nMy cousin now talks about how he and his wife have not gone *one single day* in the last 5 years without seeing and spending hours with their in laws. They\u2019re over all day. They want to stay late when my cousin and his wife want to go to bed. In laws are retired night owls and my cousin and his wife both work, and for whatever reason the in laws insist on staying at their house watching TV instead of going home next door. They won\u2019t go home until whatever they\u2019re binge watching is over. Every dinner for five years has had to be cooked for six, because the in laws always eat dinner with them.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t had a \u201cnuclear family\u201d dinner, just the four of them, in five years.\n\nMy cousin has also said he and his wife have not had one single holiday or birthday that hasn\u2019t revolved around the in laws. There has not been one single activity in five years that has just been my cousin, his wife, and their two kids. The In Laws are *always there.*\n\nVacations? In laws have to go, but they\u2019re old so they can\u2019t walk very far or fast. Their Disney trip was a disaster as the in laws couldn\u2019t keep up but cousin and his wife didn\u2019t want to leave them behind.\n\nTrip to the zoo? In laws have to go, and same deal. They can\u2019t walk fast, can\u2019t go as far, so kids end up missing out on a bunch of stuff they want to see.\n\nChristmas. New Years. Birthdays. Easter. There has not been one single day that has just been the four of them *in five years.*\n\nAnd none of this takes into account that if either in law gets sick, suddenly my cousin and his wife have 3 kids to take care of while they both work.\n\nMy cousin is seriously considering divorcing his wife over this. She hates it too but she can\u2019t say no to her parents. All he wants his some time with his family, just his wife and kids. Just the four of them. But it is *impossible,* because the in laws\u2019 feelings will be so hurt. Any time he mentions it they talk about how much they sacrificed by moving next door and lay on the guilt *thick.*\n\nI can honest say my cousin is living his own personal hell, and he can\u2019t find a way out. He is losing his mind. He doesn\u2019t want to divorce, but his wife won\u2019t put her foot down. And if he does divorce, he won\u2019t get what he actually wants, which is just some time for he and his wife and kids to bond, just the four of them. He is straight up miserable every day, and the in laws are happy as pigs in shit because they can play with the grand kids, never have to clean or cook, and can still insist on their way. And while they\u2019re old, they\u2019re still going to be around another 10-20 years, meaning my cousin will never, ever, in his life, have time with his kids and wife.\n\nGood luck.
