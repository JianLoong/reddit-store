My wife thought this would be great in the future to our parents live with us. This opened up a whole discussion.\n\nShe immediately ruled out my parents as they are very well off and would never have the need to live with us from a financial prospective. We also spent about 4 weeks with them during COVID and realized we just weren't compatible . I 100% agreed with this sentiment.\n\nThen she brought up her dad  and step mom. Out of all our parental pairs we get along with her dad and step mom the best. They are good people who do not interject, judge or overstep into our lives. They are helpful when we ask for help (which we rarely do). She mentioned that they could live in the apartment as they are low maintenance and would keep to themselves. I agreed that they would be least intrusive on our lives but would prefer that they not live with us but I didn't shut the door on them.\n\nThen came the topic of her mother Sarah. My wife thought her mom living with us could be possible as she isn't married, she wants to spend more time with her grandson (and future grandchildren) and isn't as financially well off as the others. Sarah is a wonderful person who means well but has this frantic nervous energy about her that just wears on me. Her frantic nervous energy stems from severe anxiety that manifests itself by her wanting to please everyone. This might sound wonderful at first but it wears on everyone. Simple examples like her offering a glass of water turns into a game of 20 questions with her offering every beverage in the house to you after you state you are not thirsty. \n\nShe has been in therapy for years for her anexity. This behaviour was a contributing factor in her divorce from Steve (to give some scale to how excessive it is). My wife also gets very frustrated with her mom but she manifests her annoyance by mirroring this type of behaviour. She will start speaking a mile a min asking me question after question before I have time to respond to the first.\n\nAll of this lead to say that there is NO WAY Sarah could ever live with us. As it was just put too much stress on our relationship. I was probably firmer (but not mean) then I needed to be on this point but I stand by my opinion. Having her move in with us now or down the road would just be something I will not consider (barring a serious health issue or something of that nature). I even went as far as to say we could help support her financially if it came to it.\n\nMy wife is upset and called me an asshole for shutting the door on the potential of her mother living with us. We have spoken at lengthen in the past about how spending significant time with Sarah puts a strain on our relationship so I was a bit surprised by her reaction.\n\nSo ATIA for not allowing her mother to ever live with us?", "created_utc": 1675698900, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10va10v/aita_for_not_allowing_my_mil_to_live_with_us/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said you'd be happy to help her mom financially but laid a boundary at how far you are willing to go to help. That's valid, and cooperative. \n\nI understand why it might be upsetting to her, but if your parents aren't welcome to come live in the house, then maybe it should be an all-around agreement in general to not have any of your parents move in, right?", "INFO\n\nSo right now this is just full-on theoretical?\n\nZero parents have shown any interest in moving in?", "NTA at all. If you know that you couldn't deal with living with somebody, how does that make you an AH? You've offered to financially support her mom - that's an amazing, generous offer that doesn't even approach AH territory.\n\nYour wife sounds like she's in deep need of some counseling regarding her mother. I'd propose some couples counseling here. She's prioritizing her mom above her marriage -- not ok.\n\nNTA", "**NTA.** As a married couple, you share your home.

It's something you need to agree on as a couple.\n\nYou already know that your MIL moving in could make your home life difficult and strain your relationship with each other, as well as her. You wouldn't want your child, and any future children, to grow up in a tension-filled home. Besides, you said that you wouldn't be against your MIL living with you if she had serious health issues, so you aren't being cruel. \n\nRegardless of your MIL's financial situation and struggles with anxiety, she's an adult who can look after herself.

It's OK to have different opinions on this. She is taking it personally and needs to be more logical about it. Maybe you should defend the parents you lived with for 4 weeks so she can see how unreasonable she is being.", "NTA. It is good that know her mom will cause problems in your relationship with your wife. And i agree with her not living with you.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a good conversation to have, and it's best to have expectations laid out up front. It might not be what she wanted to hear, but it's the truth.\n\nYour wife is out of line to call you an asshole. What, does she prefer you lie to her?", "NTA", "NTA.  You have a right to your feelings, as does your wife, she can be angry about it. You know your limits though, boundaries should be respected.", "NAH.\n\nI get not wanting that energy in your own house. And I get your wife feeling like she\u2019s responsible for her mother. So it\u2019s the kind of situation that makes people say - marriage is a sacrifice.\n\nI hope you guys figure it out. Best of luck. \n\nPS: There may come a time due to sickness etc that she\u2019ll have to live with you. You should be prepared for that scenario.", "NTA. I would die on this hill.\n\nBut I'm concerned about why you didn't talk about this prior to marriage. Maybe get into marriage counseling now before it's too late.", "NTA it doesn't sound like either or you want to live with each other parents which is fine but you accept that and your wife does not. I would not buy the house with the apartment with your wife as its borrowing trouble.", "Ugh... I vote for buying a house WITHOUT an apartment so this subject never has to be discussed again! NTA, OP.", "NTA You may need to ask why she is so set on moving family to live with you. It is usually only done if family is in financial distress, or you really need childcare, or they really need physical help and care. Family puts a great deal of strain on family. It would be better to keep it as a guest suite open for all family and friends to visit a couple weeks at a time, or to make it into a rental.", "NTA.  Invite her to stay with you to visit for a week and talk to your wife about it when she leaves. She'll probably end up agreeing", "Yes I honestly think her mother living would put tremendous strain on our relationship. \n\nI left the door open on her dad and step mom because they wouldn\u2019t butt into our lives as much and there isnt any friction with them. I did state my preference would be for no one to live with us ever because it just complicates things.", "Both mom and dad have made jokes about moving in in the past. I didn\u2019t put too much stock into them in the past but know it seems they were testing the waters?", "Yes there are some deep seeded issues/dependencies between her and her mother which need to be addressed. She knows they are issues.\n\nShe was hurt that I closed the door completely on her mother living with us even in a hypothetical game. I was very adamant that I wouldn\u2019t consider it which is what got to her. \n\nShe thinks I hate her mom which I do not. I am just not my best self around her and try to limit my time spent with her as it is already.", "My wife would allow my parents to live with us if it ever came to it. But they enjoy their independence and will never have the need to live with anyone since they are comfortable financially she ruled them out mostly due to financial reasons where I ruled them out due to personality reasons.", "Will become a marathon runner if she has to move in ;)", "Yes. Decided that house wasn\u2019t right for us anyway. Will be avoiding these types of homes going forward.", "I understand.\nHow long ago is this? \nIf this happened today, it might have just been an emotional response. And when she cools off she\u2019ll see where you\u2019re comming from", "It's time to address the issues. Her playing hypothetical games with you on something she knows is a problem very much feels like an intentional set-up. I wonder if there's something else going on here. Like her mom is putting pressure on her about this, or if she's pregnant and feeling anxious about raising a baby. I don't know, but counseling is highly indicated.", "This weekend. Going to let her cool off and have another discussion sometime soon", "I mean, I would suggest keeping it open for when your child wants independence but can\u2019t afford it. You can help them with a low rent and choose if you will keep all of it or set it to the side to help them with something later. Be it a down payment on a truly separate apartment or if they are having issues with other bills one month.\n\nNTA", "Tell your wife that your marriage comes first.  Your buying a home is a building block for your life together and moving in her mother who grates on your nerves will make your sense if home become a constant source of stress.  Ask your wife if she would prefer to live with her mother and not with you because you see her mom as a deal breaker. You can demonstrate your being ok with a parent of hers by reminding her how welcome her dad and step mom would be.\n\nNext ask yourself where this is coming from.\n\nShe may be looking ahead to having children and wanting child care available to her.  She likely sees her mother as needy enough to be grateful for an invite to live with you.  She is not factoring in how your MIL\u2019s anxiety will impact her ability to be a good and reliable nanny and or housekeeper.  \n\nOnce she moves in, your wife changing her mind will be messy and  your misery will grow.  \n\nYou and she can look into hiring a housekeeper or nanny for a manageable salary plus free housing.\n\nKeeping the extra apartment unoccupied and not talking it up with family may be the wiser choice.", "NTA You should definitely not buy a house with extra space for someone to move in and then the question will be moot.\n\nIt is possible that your wife feels she is most like her mother and your rejection of her feels like a rejection of your wife's personality as well.", "You are NTA -- but this is an argument you will never \"win\".\n\nI recommend that you do ***not*** buy a house which has a separate finished apartment. If you have it, it **will** eventually get filled -- and most likely by someone you don't want to be living with.\n\nDo not leave open even the possibility of a parent -- *any* parent -- living with you.", "NTA.  This is a two yes, one no situation.  She vetoed your parents and you vetoed your mother.  That\u2019s how the system works.  If she can\u2019t get past this, do not get that house.", "NTA. My MIL basically tried to invite herself to live with us and I had to put an end to that. You know she would be nothing it a problem so why would you even consider it.", "So you haven't even had a night in your 1st home yet and she's already planting seeds to move her family in. Think you need to put your foot down on this before people start taking liberties. Turn the apartment into something else too", "I would not be happy supporting her financially! It\u2019s just the lesser of two evils ;)", "We used to live in a different country then everyone. It was not something we expected to come up. We only moved back \u201chome\u201d a year ago due to a job. And people can\u2019t plan for every scenario prior to marriage.", "I think her issue was how firm and definitive I was about it. Like with her dad I played along talked about what it would be like having them around etc. \n\nWith her mom it was a strong no out of the gate for me. And I backed it up with contingencies like financial support. She thinks I hate her, which isn\u2019t true. I just know my limits with her. \n\nShe understands this all logically but I think it goes back to her childhood as this (her anxiety) is part of the reason why her dad and mom got divorced.", "You are probably right haha. Last time she spent a week with us my wife was just on EDGE!! She is probably idealizing her mom since we only see her in 1-2 hour doses recently. (She live close enough we\u2019re see will not sleep over but far enough she doesn\u2019t visit often)"]}
