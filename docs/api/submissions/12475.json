I don\u2019t care if people have them, friends, family, coworkers go for it I\u2019m not trying to be in a relationship or attracted to with them so why would I care. \n\nShe asked me about getting one that meant a lot to her and it was small and in a spot that you don\u2019t see all the time. I agreed because I knew it meant a lot. Then while on a trip with friends, she texted me and said she was getting another and I was not thrilled and asked her not to but she promised it would be small and not in a prominent area but that was not the case, larger than your hand and on her arm so I see it all the time. Then she came back from a different trip with a friend with another and didn\u2019t tell me. I was pretty pissed at that point but she thought it was playful. \n\nNow, she is texting friends about getting more and telling me about it and I am asking her to please reconsider because I just don\u2019t like them. \n\nSo now, WIBTAH if I tell her that if she keeps getting more tattoos I will not be attracted to her anymore. I get it, I\u2019m all for my body my choice, I\u2019m a woman, so yeah maybe I\u2019m the AH.

Thank you everyone who commented meaningful comments from both sides and not that I\u2019m just a shit person lol. I am going to put together my thoughts on paper this weekend so I can fully form what I want to say without just bursting it out. Yes we both do counseling now, perhaps we will do couples for this and it\u2019s great to have one in general, people are people and will have feelings whether \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d. For people saying that I\u2019m shit because I\u2019m only \u201cskin deep,\u201d spoiler alert, physical attraction isn\u2019t the only thing in a relationship and people have non-physical relationships all the time. Doesn\u2019t make theirs any less meaningful. I digress, thank you again to who provided suggestions and meaningful comments!\n\nEdit 2: if people are curious how the talk goes let me know how you actually give people a notice.

People fluctuate in weight, change their hair, end up with injuries and surgery scars- are tattoos really that different? I guess they must be for you, but I can\u2019t see how someone who truly cared for another person would be so hung up on something so surface level. Physical attraction may draw us to a partner initially, but I\u2019ve always thought that true love and deep attraction could surpass that.

Even though he's expressed his opinions, he was still supportive of me getting them because he wants me to be happy.\n\nYour partner deserves the same. If you love this person, you should want them to express themselves in any (safe) way that they want. Now, if you really can't get over it, that's fine too.

Now it's her turn to compromise, as much as all the \"her body her choice\" crowd might complain about it. Everyone has boundaries in a relationship, and if this one is yours, make that clear.

Maybe she thought that since you conceded to one, you weren\u2019t serious about disliking all tattoos and just disliked some.

The first one was already a huge compromise for you. Your dislike didn\u2019t go away with her getting one, but you wanted her to have a meaningful piece of art.

And, as you\u2019ve said, it is her body.\n\nSo neither of you are TA\u2014but if this is a big deal to you, then you might be incompatible.", "NAH you just aren\u2019t meant for each other", "NTA to end the relationship. We can't control attraction. If you find her unattractive and physical attraction is important to you that's valid. But you would be the AH to stay with her and try to control her actions. Just be honest to yourself and her that she's not the right person for you.", "NTA, I would dump her. That is the reddit way.", "What kind of a person ends a relationship because they don't like their partners new aesthetic? I can't imagine how shallow your relationship has to be for this to matter.", "Unnecessarily harsh.", "Your first point is hot garbage. OP met a person who became a different person. Physical attraction is important and OP\u2019s GF knowingly made changes that she knew were not to OP\u2019s preferences.\n\nOP has no right to control anyone\u2019s body but you saying a person significantly altering their appearance intentionally causing this rift means their relationship wasn\u2019t built on anything meaningful is not fair.", "I disagree with your first part. Physical attraction is a large part of a relationship and tattoos are permanent. Weight, hair color and length, these can all fluctuate and change. Permanent body changes like tattoos don't. \nI personally have 3 tattoos, might get more in time. Hubby has none. If he one day wanted one, I would be fine. But if he decided to do ear gauges and stretch out his lobes? That would he hard because people with stretched lobes have always been a huge turn-off for me. I don't find it attractive at all!", "This is dumb. Tattoos mean a lot of things to different people. Tattoos could also be a trigger that reminds one of someone else. Hard to convince your body to be attracted to something youre not.", "Offering her opinion and preference isn\u2019t pretentious. It is communication.", "Please update me", "It seems like a game to her. Am I wrong?", "I did everything for my kids. I only asked them one thing: don\u2019t get tattoos. I realize it\u2019s my own hang-up but they\u2019ve had EVERYTHING!! Expenisve gymnastics,dance,musical lessons. Cars at 16 (not expensive but decent). Amazing vacations they\u2019re whole lives. We raised them to be respectful well mannered and kind. They are well liked by their peers and their parents. I said if you\u2019re interested in tattoos, get henna. Then you can enjoy it for a while, but it\u2019s not permanent. But they disregarded that and as soon as they turned 18 started getting multiple tattoos.  Broke my heart. Like some of these tats are just plain AWFUL. It was a tough time to realize that even though I was supporting them, they couldn\u2019t respect my wishes. I love them but I don\u2019t think I can ever get over it. Stupid me still financially help them even as adults.", "I mean, not being attracted to your partner is a pretty good reason to end a relationship no?", "Sounds like she's made her opinion clear several times and her girlfriend obviously doesn't care. It's one thing to let your opinion be known, but OP states they got pissed that their GF got another tattoo because they know their opinion on it. She has no right to be pissed, just because you state your opinion doesn't mean your partner has to look how you want. Getting mad that someone doesn't agree with your opinion goes beyond communicating, now you're just upset they didn't do what you want.", "If a change as small as ink can diminish your attraction to a person then yeah, your attraction was superficial. If you sincerely love a person there should be enough other things you love about them to maintain your attraction even when one thing changes.", "Fair enough! I figured that'd be the response. I guess it's just too impossible to explain attraction. I mean, why my sister and I are both gay even though we were raised to be Bible-thumping Christians. Who knows. \n\nIf your SO is spending more than you guys can afford on this then I totally get you there. If it's just the physical attraction aspect of it all, then I urge you to consider if you would be able to get used to them. My husband didn't like the one on my left arm when we first met (it's a cat with two sets of eyes, or four eyes - super creepy lol) but he says he doesn't even see it anymore. Especially if you really love her. It's just not worth the heartache for something so little. Like I said before, I feel like it should be possible to compromise. \"I want you to be happy but I don't want to sacrifice the attraction I feel for you, maybe there's an art piece that we can agree on, or we can set a numbered limit to it.\" without it being an ultimatum. Good luck to you either way!\n\nYep, unfortunately they are self harm scars. They are quite noticeable on my thighs, stomach, and arms. I hate the constant reminder, I always have. I don't hide it either. If people comment, I'll just be honest that I'm a different person now. Just like you, it got me here so I don't feel ashamed. It just triggers me I guess? That's the best word I can use to describe it. I glance down at my arms and i feel such... despair. All of a sudden it's seven years ago. It definitely hurts my self image. I know that my hubs thinks I'm beautiful, and I've been to therapy, but I'm just tired of thinking about it every day. I mean, why do people get nose jobs, you know? Same kind of thing. If I could cover them with something that made me happy then that would mean the world to me. However *sigh* I have not done it. In our discussions he's always like \"I'm not going to stop you, just know I won't like it.\" it's not like a deal breaker, and I want him to be happy, so for now I'll be patient. I'm going to wear him down one of these days tho lol", "You're so awful", "It truly doesn\u2019t.", "Everyone I know who has gotten a tattoo then went and got more. I don't have one yet so I can't explain why, but once that door is open, it doesn't usually close again! \nIf her getting more tattoos is a dealbreaker for you, you have to tell her and break up. Trying to police what she does with her body is an AH move.", "You should learn what the initialisms of this subreddit are before voting though.", "Hair colour and length is temporary and likely to fluctuate over time. Tattoos are 100% permanent and a lot different. Example, you don\u2019t \u201cexperiment\u201d with a new tattoo style to \u201ctry something new\u201d the way you would hair.", "Not being attracted to your partner long term is a good reason to end any relationship. If you're genuinely not attracted to your partner anymore, you should leave so they can find someone who is and save you both some misery. \n\nWhat's the alternative? Pretending you're attracted to them and forcing yourself? You can't control attraction", "Meh...if my hubby all of a sudden said I prefer skinny women I am no longer attracted to you because you let yourself get fat. I don't think people would agree with that sentiment of \"expressing preferences\" Her GF feels pretty and confident the way she is do we really need to destroy her self esteem or should she just break up with her saying the spark is not there? Idk I'm older the whole attraction thing becomes so much less over time, but I have always been taught it is rude to comment on people's appearance, period. And controlling to do so in a relationship."]}
