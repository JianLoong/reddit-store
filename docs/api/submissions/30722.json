He does not like animals indoors. No allergies, just does not like them. My grown daughter lives 3.5 hours away and has a small lap dog. She plans to visit for 4 days over the Thanksgiving holiday and will be bringing her dog.\nI don't have a problem with this. My father said that Thanksgiving dinner will be ruined by having a disgusting dog in the home and asked that we keep the dog in the garage or outside at all times. We live in a rural area and the wooden fence around our yard would not contain the small dog.\nAlternatively, he has demanded that our daughter board her dog. I have spoken to her about this and she is not comfortable with the boarding or keeping the dog in the cold garage.\nI sat down with my father and said that this is my house and it is important to me that my daughter feels she is always welcome here so he can suck it up for a few days. He accused me of not respecting his feelings and boundaries.  My husband says we should not force my father to deal with a dog indoors since this is essentially his home too. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699642159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17saua6/aita_for_essentially_telling_my_father_my_house/", "score": 1590, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Boundaries are things that he can share about what he isn't ok with and to enforce boundaries, you exit yourself from the situation.

Some folks cannot/will not allow themselves to find joy ,and will resent and undermine those who can.\n\nSet this man straight ,NOW!!!  Do not give him the foothold he is trying to create.  You allow him to dictate how this event pans out ,and he will dig in deeper as each event that does not suit him comes to pass.\n\nHe may be your father ,your blood ,but he cannot be your lord and master in your own home.\n\nTell him today that the shenanigans stop ,or else he can eat alone in his room ,while you and your family (including the dog) enjoy the holiday and each other\u2019s company.", "NTA and thank you for sticking up for your grown daughter and her dog.

He\u2019d not tell anyone he was hungry or thirsty ,then tell other\u2019s he was being denied food and such.  He\u2019d eat cold leftovers and later complain about not getting hot food.  He\u2019d eat cookies for most of a day then later tell people he was hungry but not being fed.\n\nI saw him do these things ,tell these lies.  I\u2019d be in the next room when he\u2019d wet his pants AND the couch.  Then he\u2019d come to me and tell me he did it because no one would help him stand up so he could walk to the restroom.  He knew I was in the next room.  He never asked for help.  He created deliberate conflict because he wanted others to be just as unhappy and miserable as he himself was.  He never asked for food ,for help doing things ,but then turned it into \u201cno one feeds me or does anything to help me\u201d.  He\u2019d tell aide workers he could feed himself ,dress himself ,live like a man half his age ,then do none of those things ,and blame others for not caring enough to help him.  He eventually even got to the point where he would curse at and say vile things to my little granddaughters because he started feeling even they were out to get him.\n\nI know he was declining mentally,but come on.  He was just becoming deliberately abusive and vile simply because (I think) he was losing his ability to manipulate the people around him.  I think the deciding factor regarding his removal from our home was when I told my daughter about a scene I walked in on.  He was standing in his room fully naked ,cursing and swearing at one of my granddaughters ,because she was not putting his socks on his feet fast enough.  I of course sent the girl off to her room and spoke reasonably with her (after I finished dressing him) about how what happened was not in any way her fault.  He was gone shortly after that.\n\nAlso ,to fully explain my feeling the way I did/do I feel I need to point out that my father was extremely bigoted and racist as well ,and my granddaughters are biracial.
