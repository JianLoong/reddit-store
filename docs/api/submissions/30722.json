{"id": 30722, "submission_id": "17saua6", "title": "AITA for essentially telling my father \"my house my rules\"?", "selftext": "My elderly father lives with me and my husband. He does not like animals indoors. No allergies, just does not like them. My grown daughter lives 3.5 hours away and has a small lap dog. She plans to visit for 4 days over the Thanksgiving holiday and will be bringing her dog.\nI don't have a problem with this. My father said that Thanksgiving dinner will be ruined by having a disgusting dog in the home and asked that we keep the dog in the garage or outside at all times. We live in a rural area and the wooden fence around our yard would not contain the small dog.\nAlternatively, he has demanded that our daughter board her dog. I have spoken to her about this and she is not comfortable with the boarding or keeping the dog in the cold garage.\nI sat down with my father and said that this is my house and it is important to me that my daughter feels she is always welcome here so he can suck it up for a few days. He accused me of not respecting his feelings and boundaries.  My husband says we should not force my father to deal with a dog indoors since this is essentially his home too. \nAITA?\n\nEDIT: My suggestion is to get a baby gate. The dog would not be allowed in the kitchen or dining room at all and would be shut in daughter's room during meals. The dog is well groomed and will be freshly groomed/bathed before they visit. The dog gets excited with people and does like to jump at them for attention, however my daughter is good about keeping her on a leash if she's overly excited. \nMy father's compromise is to keep the dog in the garage with a space heater and dog bed.", "created_utc": 1699642159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17saua6/aita_for_essentially_telling_my_father_my_house/", "score": 2686, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Boundaries are things that he can share about what he isn't ok with and to enforce boundaries, you exit yourself from the situation.

He\u2019d refuse to go places with the family ,because he just knew every time he got in the car that they were probably going to drop him off at a home for the elderly.  He was unhappy ,combative ,and vindictive ,because he saw everyone around him as being against him.\n\nI watched him destroy my daughter mentally/emotionally.  I saw him throw everything she tried to do for him right back at her ,because \u201cshe was just doing it to distract him from her ultimate plan of tossing him into a home\u201d.\n\nI saw him physically throw things at her ,and drive her to tears.

The man destroyed me ,my emotional/mental well being the same way.\n\nSome folks are just miserable ,and love it when those around them are in the same state.  Some folks cannot/will not allow themselves to find joy ,and will resent and undermine those who can.\n\nSet this man straight ,NOW!!!  Do not give him the foothold he is trying to create.  You allow him to dictate how this event pans out ,and he will dig in deeper as each event that does not suit him comes to pass.\n\nHe may be your father ,your blood ,but he cannot be your lord and master in your own home.\n\nTell him today that the shenanigans stop ,or else he can eat alone in his room ,while you and your family (including the dog) enjoy the holiday and each other\u2019s company.", "NTA and thank you for sticking up for your grown daughter and her dog.

He liked to think that we didn't know he smoked, but really?\n\nWhen he taught me to drive, I'd want to have the music on, but he would turn it off and tell me that when I had my own car, I could listen to whatever I wanted to.\n\nSo we're driving from my brother's house in the Bay Area back home to Sacramento after Christmas, and I had the radio on in the car. He's in the back seat and he tells me to turn the radio off. I refuse. He got all snotty, and I told him, \"when I was a kid, you told me when it was my car, I could listen to anything I wanted to, and don't you just hate it when your words turn around and bite you in the ass?\"\n\nHe was not happy.\n\nThings escalated when we stopped at for a bathroom stop. He wanted me to back in to the parking spot so he would not have the sun in his face, he could roll the window down and have a smoke without having to get out of the car. He had issues with mobility, and getting out of the car was very difficult for him.\n\nHe thought he could sneak a smoke while mom and I went in to use the bathroom and we wouldn't notice. All I ever asked of him was never to smoke in my car. \n\nI refused to back in to the parking spot because this car was new to me and much larger than I was accustomed to.\n\nHe was icy cold to me the rest of the way home.\n\nThings blew up when we got home, and it was pretty ugly, but I was done with the disrespect. He told me that I couldn't talk to him that way, that he wasn't just anybody. In the heat of the moment, I told him that I wasn't just anybody either, and being in my late 50s, was too old for him to treat me like a child anymore.\n\nWe were okay a day or so later, but I think that was the only big blow up I ever had with my dad.\n\nThere's a point in one's life when one's role with one's parents switches, and one becomes the adult and the parent becomes the child. I think this is about that point for me and Dad.\n\nYour father seems to have forgotten the fact that he's living in your house, and is trying to treat you like the child he remembers you to be. It's admirable that you attempt to compromise, but because it's just his personal feelings, rather than allergies, it's important he understands who's really in charge in the house. If he feels that strongly about it, you could suggest he go stay in a hotel while your daughter visits.", "Why is your husband not siding with his daughter?
