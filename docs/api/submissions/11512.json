Now, that is, if not outright rude, at least very callous.  But, they were a gift, and no-one is obligated to keep a gift, though it is generally kinder to keep a handmade gift.  She didn't, which was a very good indication to you that it would be silly for you to continue to put in all that effort and spend all the money on supplies for another handmade gift, even one she said she wanted.

Just like we aren't obligated to keep gifts, we are not obligated to give them either, particularly not when they represent a ton of time and work.  \n\nOverall, I think you're in a no-win situation.  She sounds like a very controlling woman who creates a lot of strife and throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way - hence the nasty phone call from your FIL - she threw a fit at him, and he transferred it on to you.  My guess is that even if you had made a cardigan for her, she would have found something wrong with it and blamed you for that, no matter how lovely it actually was.  So, since there's no way to please her, you might as well relax and not worry about it.  If you don't let her wind you up, then you aren't playing, and you have won.

I had already started blankets for the twins, it was something I do for close family members & friends (she knew this). I pivoted and gifted them to people who would appreciate them & just gave her a registry gift.", "NTA\n\nIf I hand make you something, and you toss it, or ignore it, I don't make you anything again.", "NTA.\n\nA handcrafted gift is a labor of love plus the cost of materials and time, so you are well within your rights to choose who gets one.", "NTA.  She showed she didn't appreciate you or your knitting and your father in law is way the fuck out of line calling you a bitch and your husband is an asshole to for not standing up for your and to his father for calling you a bitch.  \n\nIf I were you I'd not only continue to not knit a damn thing for them but I'd cut his family out too and tell your husband to grow a spine.", "NTA - you can choose to go no contact with them. Your spineless husband can continue seeing them but FIL can\u2019t swear at you, period.", "NTA.  When you place an order, you pay for it and then the contract only goes into effect if accepted by the craftsperson.\n\nGifts are freewill. She had shown that she didn't like your homemade items, so you freely decided not to spend time on a cardigan for her.\n\nThe MIL and FIL are totally out of line.", "NTA  never the asshole.\n\nShe didn't appreciate your gift and she didn't even had the grace to pretend that she liked it. \n\nShe openly criticized your gift and gave it away without a second thought. No way she deserves your effort and time a second time. She didn't deserved the first. \n\nThis is why I don't gift crocheted stuff anymore. Either people don't appreciate it or they feel entitled to it.", "True, that they don't have to keep your gift, they can do with your gift whatever they want to do.  *But they went out of their way to make sure you KNEW she didn't like it, didn't appreciate your work, and gave it instead to a stranger.*  If they still wanted your work but on a different project, they would have been politer and more discreet about the project itself.  I don't know how many times my Mom donated coffee mugs and scarves and who knows how many gifts.  But she never went out of her way to tell the gifter that their gift was trash and that she took it to the goodwill.   NTA", "NTA. Handmade things are a blessing, it's a symbol of both your time and love. If people can't be bothered to show appreciation for the things I make them then they're not getting anything else from me. People treat artists and crafters like vending machines that they can just push a button and get what they want. It doesn't work that way. You show me love and appreciation and I'll make you something out of love and appreciation. OP, if I were you, I'd suggest to MIL to learn how to knit and make her own cardigan. Maybe she'd start to appreciate other's hard work when she has to do it herself, heh.", "Absolutely NTA, OP!  Stop feeling bad this instant!  As a person who stitches (not knitting, but cross stitch) I know how much time and effort you put into those projects.  They take months and a lot more money than people realize.  Your MIL insulted you and disrespected you by throwing your gift to Goodwill.  She has no right to expect you to EVER waste your time or money on another.  And if my FIL ever called me a bitch I\u2019d never speak to him again.  Stop feeling bad.  They are rude, unappreciative people.  Keep giving them flowers and cards.  They don\u2019t deserve your creativity and handmade items.", "Some people are just not knitworthy\u2014LOVE this!", "> knitworthy\n\nThat's a perfect word. Can I steal it?", "Same\n\nNTA", "Take out the tags and claim you made it.", "I want to know this, too!", "My sister knits and crochets, a ton.  I get handmade scarves and slippers and stuff.\n\nI don't wear slippers.  but!  I never toss them out.  One pair I keep around for my friend when she visits, sometimes I pass them on to somebody.  Sis is aware of this, and is fine, because somebody is getting to enjoy them.\n\nAlso because she thinks it's hilarious to give me slippers.", "His father called you a bitch and he let him.", "He needs to start. He is married to you, not his mother. It doesn't have to mean burning bridges and going scorched earth, just setting some boundaries and making it clear that he has your back.", "By not choosing side, he\u2019s chosen a side.  And if someone calls his wife a bitch, he needs to get off of his @ and do something!  \ud83d\ude21", "The last line is peak sibling energy", "That's why the FIL was comfortable calling her that. She has a husband problem. I would never feel secure with a man like that.", "WOW. My SIL made us a stained glass lamp for over our dining table as a wedding gift (we eloped, so there was no registry or anything, and absolutely no obligation to gift anything on anyone). 43 years later, we still have it! It is priceless to me, as both an object and as a sign of genuine love. Your ex-friends are major AHs.", "Wow, that makes me so sad.  I treasure things people hand make for me.  A stained glass panel is an amazing gift!"]}
