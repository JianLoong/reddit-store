She was not happy with them, they were too tacky and not modern enough for her. So she gave them to the goodwill. I was so absolutely hurt but figured it was my own fault for not making them more her style so now I only make things for myself. \n\nFor her birthday she wanted a knitted cardigan. I didn\u2019t want to make it and I didn\u2019t have the time or supplies either. I just got her some flowers and a card. We went to their house for her birthday dinner and she was immediately not happy as soon as I walked in. She asked me where was the cardigan and that she had been waiting for a month to get. I told her that unfortunately I didn\u2019t have the time but I had got her something else. She just got really quiet the rest of the night. Later my FIL called and told us that I had caused my MIL to feel like I didn\u2019t care anymore because I wouldn\u2019t make the time. I brought up that the last time I made her something she took it to the goodwill. My FIL told me that I was being a bitch and it shouldn\u2019t have mattered what she chose to do with her gift. \n\n I\u2019m starting to feel terrible but I really didn\u2019t want my MIL to just trash my hours of hard work. I should\u2019ve just made the cardigan regardless and my husband agrees. My family thinks that I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. So now I feel very conflicted.

Some people are not knitworthy. Your mil has shown she isn't. Save you knitting time for people who appreciate it and keep on giving her store bought things. If she asks for a cardigan again just go to the store and buy one for her. Not worth your time and effort.", "NTA\n\n>it shouldn\u2019t have mattered what she chose to do with her gift.\n\nThis also applies the other way round. It shouldn't matter what gift you chose to give her. Its not like you turn up with no gifts. you did give her something. I understand how it feels to make something for someone only to have it r given to goodwill or even thrown away.", "NTA, stepping forward to ask what the h3ll has your husband been doing during this gong show? Your MIL is delusional and entitled, your FIL should learn how to knit if he wants to show how much he cares instead of calling to harass you. Your husband should shut it ALL down and go over and read his parents the riot act and you, you should never, ever make anything for this bunch of ingrates again.", "NTA. So your MIL and FIL are horrible, whiny people, and you\u2019re falling over yourself to try to please them? The correct answer to FIL\u2019s sniveling was, \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t have time to make things for someone who doesn\u2018t appreciate my work. Sorry.\u201d\n\nSeriously.

What is your husband getting his mom???", "I\u2019m a crocheter. If I had made something for my MIL that was donated to Goodwill she\u2019d NEVER get another thing from me. Never\u2026ever\u2026would I waste another minute making her anything. If she asks again tell her you\u2019re just matching her energy. She can\u2019t be bothered to appreciate your effort so you can\u2019t be bothered with her requests. NTA\n\nThis is a hill I would die on. I\u2019d go out of my way to gift handmade things to everyone but her.", "NTA - you made her a very personal and thoughtful gift in the stockings and she got rid of them. Flowers and a card were more than enough, maybe too much.", "NTA at all. As someone who crochets, these projects take hours of time. If you were paid by the hour for completing something like a cardigan, we could be looking at hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars. You tried being thoughtful before and she wasn\u2019t receptive at all nor did she appreciate your hard work. She blew her chance. \n\nNo one can demand you do free labor for them. No one can emotionally blackmail you into doing free labor for them. Honestly, your husband needs to stand behind you on this. Idk how long you\u2019ve been married but there needs to be mutual respect between you and your MIL, which he can and should facilitate. \n\nAlso, tacky Christmas stockings - isn\u2019t that the point?? It\u2019s the one time of year you can pull out all the stops, especially with stockings. She could\u2019ve used them one year and maybe added something to them later so they fit in with her \u201cstyle.\u201d", "NTA. First of, who demands a present? And a really time consuming one as well\n\nShe just gave your hardwork away last time, why should you sacrifice so much time again? You still got her a gift, she can just buy a knitted cardigan \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong and your husband should see that as well. I would've been so upset in your place", "Calling you a b@@&ch was a nice touch by your MIL after throwing away your earlier gift and demanding more. NTA", "Nta She was rude and gave away the stockings. I would never make her anything again.", "She is clearly not knit-worthy.", "NTA-She\u2019s absolutely free to discard her gift if she wants but you are equally free to decide that someone who doesn\u2019t appreciate the effort and time it took you to create such a thoughtful gift isn\u2019t entitled to anymore of your creative gifts. She should be grateful you acknowledged her at all.", "NTA, and the level of entitlement and disregard makes me want to refer you over to /r/JUSTNOMIL AND /r/raisedbynarcissists.\n\nShe basically THREW AWAY about 50 hours of your work, not to mention whatever it cost in supplies.", "NTA. Next time she asks you to make her something tell her you are too busy. Your in-laws are awful people.", "Everyone is already saying NTA but yes NTA. My MIL never thanks me when I get her really thoughtful and expensive gifts and I know this was the last gift I gave her. I don\u2019t believe this kind of people are possible to please. No matter how beautiful or how much her style the cardigan was, she would probably still complain about something. Save your time", "NTA\n\nShe was rude and ungrateful the last time.\n\nShe is not knit worthy.", "NTA!!!!!\n\nYour MIL is not knit-worthy.\n\nDo not give your art, your labor of love to anyone who cannot appreciate the time, effort and skill that you out into it.", "NTA. (Knitter here.) Absolutely not. The first home made gift that you gave your MIL went to the *Goodwill.* Also, your FIL called you a bitch for not wanting to risk hours and hours on the possibility that MIL might not toss this one. They're both jerks. They can get gift cards for the rest of their lives, from their son.", "NTA", "NTA. Fuck that lady", "NTA.

Both your inlaws are assholes and your husband must have hereditary asshole genes because you should not have been expected to make more gifts when she was so disgustingly unkind about hours of work you did. She can donate and give away store bought gifts from now on. Or your husband can knit her a cardigan.", "Wait so if according to your FIL it didn't matter what your MIL did with the gift why would your MIL be so pressed to get a cardigan sweater only to find out a week later she doesn't like it.. She should learn the value of ones time. \n\n\nNTA", "NTA.   She didn't and doesn't understand the time, effort, and materials that go into a handmade gift.  There is no way in hell that I would make her or any of them anything else.  No.  I would have went online and purchased her a cardigan.   She would never get anything else from me.   That is one of the reasons why I don't gift stuff to my family.   Nope.", "NTA. Your MIL sounds like a real treat. As a fellow knitter, I feel your pain at having your handmade gifts give to goodwill. That\u2019s so rude! I would never take the time to make something for her again.

Don't waste your time knitting for someone who doesn't appreciate your efforts. She's lucky even lucky to get a card.", "Wow NTA\n\nAs someone who crochets very infrequently and can not knit to save my life, it takes so much time to make something. It was so thoughtful and wonderful of you to make something for them. And she just threw it away (gave to goodwill but basically same idea). It's horrible of her to treat you like this, and you FIL is terrible to call to berate you! \n\nMy ex's mom once knitted me a beaded shawl, and that is still one of my prized possessions, years later! They are not worthy of your handmade gifts.", "INFO: How many hours of work does your husband put into your mother's presents?  He does do all the gift shopping for your family, right?  Puts hours of labor into giving them handcrafted gifts?  No?  Why not?", "Okay. It would be bad enough if you spent money you didn\u2019t have on a gift that someone gave away. But you\u2019re talking about your time, energy, and love getting tossed in the Goodwill bin. Never ever ever think twice about making this woman another thing. \n\nNTA\n\nbtw someone who shops at Goodwill loved those socks", "NTA.  She didn't like the stockings you made and gave them away.  Now, that is, if not outright rude, at least very callous.  But, they were a gift, and no-one is obligated to keep a gift, though it is generally kinder to keep a handmade gift.  She didn't, which was a very good indication to you that it would be silly for you to continue to put in all that effort and spend all the money on supplies for another handmade gift, even one she said she wanted. (And, it's pretty nervy of her to **demand** any gift, never mind a handmade gift.)  Just like we aren't obligated to keep gifts, we are not obligated to give them either, particularly not when they represent a ton of time and work.  \n\nOverall, I think you're in a no-win situation.  She sounds like a very controlling woman who creates a lot of strife and throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way - hence the nasty phone call from your FIL - she threw a fit at him, and he transferred it on to you.  My guess is that even if you had made a cardigan for her, she would have found something wrong with it and blamed you for that, no matter how lovely it actually was.  So, since there's no way to please her, you might as well relax and not worry about it.  If you don't let her wind you up, then you aren't playing, and you have won.  And at least you didn't spend all that time and energy and give a lovely cardigan to a rather nasty woman.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even make her a \u2018chocolate\u2019 pie. \ud83d\ude11", "NTA. I knitted an intricately cabled cardigan as a test-knit in a month only once because I knew the designer personally. The fact that your MIL gave away something you made with tons of work, and then expected a hand knit from you speaks volumes of herself. \n\nMaybe you can hit up Goodwill or another thrift store for her next sweater. Better yet, buy one from a big box store, remove the sewn in care tags, and consider yourself all set.", "NTA\nIts a hobby. You do it when you have, time , energy , supplies, and feel inspired.  None of those things were true. To hell with her. Tell her that for your birthday , all you want to not have things you put time effort and love into crapped all over by someone whose opinion mattered to you. See if she can comply.", "Amen! Handmade gifts are often so special. You can\u2019t expect to get one every holiday. Makers gotta spread that love around. You certainly don\u2019t throw a handmade gift away and expect to be able to \u201corder\u201d another. Damn. My grandmother made me an afghan when I graduated high school. She didn\u2019t make me one every year. It\u2019s my prized possession.

And some more unusual ones.", "When someone disrespects something that you hand-made for them, they shouldn't get any other hand-made things from you, imo. She clearly doesn't respect the amount of time, energy, and resources that go into knitting something, nor the care and attention you gave her when you originally gifted the stockings.", "They are entitled.", "And why isnt husband defending her?", "This right here.   She would NEVER EVER EVER get another thing from me.   Nope.", "Same", "She probably has a friend who wanted a knit cardigan.", "\\^ THIS. \n\nI once made someone a large stained glass panel as a wedding present, and they were upset that I hadn't bought them something off of the registry. I spent HOURS on that panel, and I based the design on a glass lamp that they already had, so I knew they would like it. \n\nWe're no longer friends.", "Yeah. Is it like the 1940s or something? The dynamics here are horrendous", "This makes me so sad! I hope you have found better friends who appreciate when you make them something."]}
