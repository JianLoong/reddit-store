Strangers should NEVER touch you without your permission. You did the right thing removing yourself from the situation, and he\u2019s lucky he got away with a slap on the hand and a scolding.\n\nNTA", "NTA that man had no right to touch you. None whatsoever. Him pointing out and loudly commenting on your scar was already unacceptable enough.\n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. For a moment, I thought you might be my daughter writing this, as she is recovering from a major left leg surgery too, but knee to hip, so not her. Holy hell. If I ever got wind that someone poked my daughter on her surgery scar, I would go ballistic. That man had no right to touch you. What he did is assault if you\u2019re in the USA, and you could have pressed charges. He caused you physical pain by touching you without your permission. \n\nTake care, and use cocoa or shea butter on those scars after each and every shower/bath. If anyone touches you again, scream assault. Get well soon.", "NTA he put his actual hands on you. You were well within your rights to object.", "NTA\u2026 why is a stranger putting their hands on you.   \n\n\nFor funsies\u2026 next time\u2026 yell out \u201cGet your hands off me you old PERVERT\u201d and move away.

In the actual fuck.. Touches a strangers scar??\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Absolutely not! You were completely justified in your reaction. It's unacceptable for someone to stare, point out, and even touch your scar without your consent. You had every right to assert your boundaries and defend yourself. The man's behavior was intrusive and disrespectful, and you shouldn't feel guilty for standing up for yourself. Your reaction was completely understandable given the circumstances.", "NTA", "Nta he shouldn't be doing that to anyone. Why on earth no one attempted to point this out to him is beyond me", "NTA OP.  Technically, touching you without permission is considered assault, so you could have reported him to the police.", "You are DEFINITELY NTA. How DARE he treat you that way? Who the hell does he think he is, poking and prodding at the body of a stranger? This makes me so angry!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
