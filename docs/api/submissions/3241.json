{"id": 3241, "submission_id": "z4qwlr", "title": "AITA for not letting SILs hold my baby?", "selftext": "Our family went to Thanksgiving last night and I refused to let either of the two SILs hold 4 month old son. He wasn't feeling the greatest, so I used that and him needing a diaper change or a nap as an excuse when either of these women wanted to hold him. My husband was pissed. But I feel like my reasoning is perfectly acceptable, so I want to know... AITA?\n\n First SIL is a heavy abuser of pills. Pills of any kind and will take uppers and downers any chance she can get. She was even caught stealing her sick father's morphine and is so high she can barely take care of herself. I was informed last night that she would be attending Thanksgiving because \"she got a refill on her pills\". Knowing that she sleeps through her own daughter, 3y/o getting outside, and that she is barely with it enough to talk every time I've met her, I feel confident in my choice of not letting her hold my son. \n\nThe second SIL I have issues with stemming back from high-school and it may seem petty, but that's why I'm here. Back in high school I was bullied by several \"popular\" girls. I couldn't walk anywhere without being called nasty names or hearing nasty rumors about me. I'd sit in class with these girls spitting spit balls into my hair and once my back pack was stolen, my school books and homework were shredded and my personal journal was taken and shared with who knows how many people. Needless to say, my high school years were traumatic and heartbreaking. This SIL was part of that girl group. Fast forward MANY years, she is married to my husband's brother. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt that she had grown up and we were now adults, and neither of us acknowledged our high school days. As a matter of fact, at the last family gathering, I'd thought that we had hit it off and had some good conversations. I later found out that she was telling my husband's family that I was a bad mother for having a 2 white claws while at the gathering. Her reasoning was that I was breastfeeding, however, I fed my son BEFORE I had any drinks, and did not breastfeed him again until much later that evening. (We had bottles prepared just so I could relax and enjoy myself a bit.) I then heard that she was complaining to the family about how our family is ALWAYS doing something. It was meant to be an attack on us, although it just came across to me as jealousy. In the end, I feel I gave her another chance to redeem herself, and she proved to me that she has not changed much from the 15+ years since we graduated high school. And for that reason, I don't feel that I should have to allow her access to my son either. \n\nIn all honesty, I feel that no matter what my reasons are, I should absolutely be able to choose who I do and not let my children around and whether people like it or not is too bad. But apparently that is not ok with my husband. I was made to feel like complete shit for that choice and he did not have my back during this ordeal and now I feel like trash. AITA?\n\nI feel like I should edit an update: I did just talk with my husband about this after my post and here is where we ended up. I initially was under the assumption that he did not agree with my decision and he assured me that he does agree with me and my reasons for not allowing them to hold him. But what he did say was that he is upset because he feels the decision makes it difficult for him to interact with his family because he does not want to be put on the spot if either of them ask to hold the baby. He does not want to cause problems with his family by saying no to them but allowing others to hold him. This is why he was angry with me last night, because it made it difficult for him. So in my mind, he is willing to allow unsafe or inappropriate interactions in order to \"not rock the boat\". That being said, I feel like I know who the asshole truly is in the situation...", "created_utc": 1669417035, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4qwlr/aita_for_not_letting_sils_hold_my_baby/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you won't always be able to hide behind a nappy/diaper change... You need to find a way to either confront your SILs (politely) or accept that at one point they will pick up your child.

Your son is yours and if you don't feel comfortable, you can't force him upon other people, even at 4 months.

In regards to SIL 2, honestly, I wouldn't let my former bullies hold my child either, even if they are now technically family. What if she's so petty and prefers to cause and start high school drama that she purposely hurts your baby? Not a risk I'd be willing to take.

The way that you choose to handle these interactions with your SIL will determine the amount of enjoyment you and your family experience when going to extended family events for the foreseeable future.  Don't put your kids in the middle of your personal vendetta against their aunt.  They're going to develop their own opinions about her, and their opinions might be drastically different from yours.

He would just rather not rock the boat I guess. As for still being upset about what happened in high school, it doesn't really upset me.

I was willing to assume the best of her and chalk up the past to the past because people do stupid things, especially in school.
