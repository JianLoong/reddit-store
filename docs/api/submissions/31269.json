You made an empty promise to your son. The fallout is your fault entirely. Boohoo you, your son doesn't want a relationship with someone who is manipulative, conniving and dishonest. It seems he is a great judge of character despite his challenges.", "YTA. You made a promise to your son with absolutely **zero** intentions of keeping it. You made your bed, now you get to sleep in it.", "Why are you asking whether YTA? Can you articulate any way that you\u2019re not? I surely can\u2019t.", "YTA. You\u2019ve shown your son- and it doesn\u2019t sound like for the first time- that you are not a man of your word, you lie, are full of BS, and can\u2019t be trusted. Your son did this to earn your respect and time, and you\u2019re giving him neither. You wanted him to get good grades- but you don\u2019t actually want to spend time with him? Way to show him how you value him! A clever son you can brag about, but one who won\u2019t speak to you. How can you think you\u2019ve done the right thing here? Edit to say: especially when you\u2019re dealing with an autistic person who will not see the grey in most situations, you\u2019re dealing with quite black and white thinking. You made a promise and have broken it, end of.", "YTA\n\nYou made a promise and broke it. Your son kept hides end of the agreement and you are not. This is one of those moments your son will look back on later in life. Don\u2019t promise things you have no intention or ability to deliver. You are absolutely the AH.", "Your ex is right.  YTA and you did put yourself in this situation.  You admit you lied so that your son would try harder.  Autism has nothing to do with this.  You lied to your kid.

In what world would you not be TA for that?", "YTA dont make promises to kids that you dont intend to keep", "YTA.\n\nWhat the hell were you expecting? You did this on purpose, you knew the outcome that he would be upset and you lied to him. Your kid was getting average grades and that\u2019s perfectly fine, but instead of actually praise your son and show him you are proud of him you trick him like he\u2019s stupid. \n\nHave fun not talking to your son for as long as he decides to keep you out of your life, you earned this.", "YTA. Here\u2019s a nugget for thought\u2014in 20 years your job probably won\u2019t remember you. Core memories and broken promises will be with your son forever. Bribery is shit for parenting BTW.

You totally lied and betrayed your son. Why are you even asking? Make time. Keep your damned promise.", "Troll\n\nNo one is this cartoonishly villainous.", "YTA. You made a deal with him.

I know nuance is sometimes lost on kids like him, and the reactions to other\u2019s behavior can be extreme sometimes, but you pulled a dick move and it\u2019s so obvious. You made a commitment to him, you should have kept your promise, and tough luck, you made your bed, you either lie in it or you stand for all eternity, wondering why, why did I not do what I said I would. Yes, YTA, and I can\u2019t believe someone could be so blockheaded. The poor kid reacted totally appropriately. Also, you manipulated him into getting the grades. Just terrible.", "YTA. 10/10 AH. You used your son\u2019s intelligence against him, making false promises to connive him into doing, by your standards, well. It sounds like he would have done just fine, but when he double downed, you just folded.\n\nAlso, him having autism, has nothing to do with this. This is an expected response from any teen who is made a big promise and then it never comes to fruition despite working their ass off to hold up their end of the bargain. \n\nStop. Manipulating.

You broke your promise, broke his trust and set him up for failure. My son is like yours- ASD, normal school, very intelligent and hates study. If I did this to him, his trust in me would be obliterated and he would be angry, not to mention embarrassed because he\u2019s told his friends about it and you lied. You lied to your kids face.  Asshole is mild.  Get it together and take your kid in the tip you promised him.", "YTA obviously. You set up an incentive based on a promise that you're incapable of keeping, Which apparently you knew when you set it up, since you didn't mention your job changing recently. This is top of the list of parenting no-nos, right up there with making a threat that you'd be unwilling to carry out. But even worse, because you broke your son's heart.\n\nETA The right thing to do is to pay for him to go with his mom or someone else who can get the time.", "You seriously have to ask? Of course you are. You said it yourself. He always wanted to go there. You saw how excited he was, how happy you made him, and you made a promise that sounds like you never actually intended to keep. \n\nThis is all on you. You manipulated your son to get him to do what you wanted him to do. \n\nYou said he was tired of your bullshit, so honestly, this doesn't come across as the first time you've done something like this. \n\nHim being autistic doesn't matter. You shouldn't do something like this to anyone. \n\nYTA", "Definitely AH.  WOW, you make a promise and know even at that time, that you can't keep it.  That takes some nerve.  Now, your son won't speak to you????  Just how are you going to fix this?  Your son is only 17, will he ever trust you again???  This is more then a miss step, this was done on purpose, and that is ignorant\n\nIf you want to make this better, schedule your holiday in the summer and take your son to Florida.  Explain to your boss, that you broke a promise, and now must honor it.  If your boss has any sense of fairness, that boss will agree and tell you to take your son to Florida.\n\nIn the future, stop making promises that you have no intention of keeping.  Start being the stand up father you are suppose to be.\n\nI wish you the best, as well as your entire family.", "YTA\nYou set clear conditions and a clear reward and your son was about to learn that hard work gets rewarded. Now all you've managed to do is teach him that he can put in all the work he wants and not get rewarded. His grades will be for nothing. School stuff gets forgotten once you're out of school anyway\n\nIf you made the mistake of making a promise you can't keep, you could at least try to offer an equivalent alternative. From the way you write, it seems you did not even do that", "Obviously, YTA. The fact that you\u2019re asking for lots of people to tell the same means you must enjoy hearing it.", "yes, YTA.  \n\n\nyou don't do that to your kid, autism or not. you don't lie, get their hopes up on something they really want, then rip it away from them after they do exactly what was required to earn what you said you'd do. you just DON'T.", "YTA\n\nFucking obviously. How wouldn't you be? You made a promise to your son you never intended to keep and are shocked when he's upset that you yanked his dream away from him?

How would you feel if you got offered a bonus at work if you met some KPIs and you slaved your guts out and they then told you it had all been a lie to get a particular project done. That you could whistle for your bonus and they were smug about tricking you. Would you want to stay with that company? \n\nBecause that is what you have done to your son. You lied to motivate him. And it worked, he was motivated. And then you tell him he is less important than your job. Why would he trust or want to be with you again?", "YTA. You basically lied you had no intention to keep your promise.", "YTA. You destroyed his trust in you.", "YTA-you promised him a trip that you had no intention of following through with. What you did was manipulative.  I find it hard to believe that you think that what you did was a good idea. No wonder he doesn\u2019t want anything more to do with you.", "YTA: did you think lying to your son was acceptable because he's autistic? Or can you simply not be bothered with him because work is more important? He busted his butt off and was extremely proud of himself and you got his hopes up only to brush him off and say \"sorry I can't be bothered with you I don't have time\"   \nOkay work's a pain and sometimes that's unexpected, but doesn't sound like you made an effort to compromise or make up for it.  you simply decided because he didn't matter.   \nyou didn't want to make time for him, now you're mad he won't make Time for you. You lied and emotionally manipulated him.", "I guess 5 months of NC coming from your son should have been enough for you to realise what kind of a father you are, but I see that you are still struggling with putting two and two together. \nSo just for you:\nYTA.", "YTA. A HUUUUUUUUUUGGGE AH.", "Wow, you are bereft of any sense of humanity and honesty. WTF is wrong with you. I don\u2019t care if you need to sell a kidney, keep your damn word to your son. At least think of the lessons you are teaching him. AITA is simply not enough to encapsulate the depravity your behavior. You should be ashamed.", "YTA. When you make a promise to your child, autism or not, you keep it. You deserve for him to choose to have nothing to do with you from now on. \nShame on you, and don\u2019t call yourself a father because a father wouldn\u2019t do what you did. \nAnd I\u2019m willing to bet that this isn\u2019t the first time you have broken a promise to him.", "Yta what a shitty thing to do to your son. It definitely sounds like this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve lied to him and disappointed him. Be a better father to him and work on yourself to figure out why you thought it was okay to lie and trick your son.", "YTA. Were you hoping the whole time that your son would fail, so that you wouldn\u2019t have to take him to FL or admit that you couldn\u2019t?  Did you assume he would fail because he\u2019s autistic?  Cause otherwise I don\u2019t see what being autistic has to do with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy own dad broke my heart many times over, and it didn\u2019t take anything like a \\[fake\\] trip to Florida to do it. He once promised us kids $5 per A as a reward if we got all As on our report cards. When I succeeded, he backtracked and said No, it was $5 total. (Trust me, I remembered it correctly. I\u2019d been planning what to spend that money on for the whole semester.)\n\nThen after I walked away with my $5 instead of the $30 he\u2019d promised me, I heard him chuckling that he\u2018d saved himself twenty-five bucks.  THAT was worth more to him than being a man that his daughter could trust.\n\nHe also liked to claim that his good intentions mattered more than what he actually did. Which is exactly what \u201cThe only thing I wanted is that my son got good grades\u201d sounds like to me. Bullpuckeys.\n\nMy dad is an asshole, and so are you.", "Okay, clearly YTA and you know it. \n\nBut what you might not know is that your son being autistic has no bearing on this post. You could have just said \u201cmy son\u201d and not added the \u201cautistic\u201d part at all. \n\nSo, either you define your son by his autism or you didn\u2019t think he was bright enough to understand the deal or you think we\u2019ll give you a pass on your behavior because your son is autistic. None of those options are great and push you from AH to monster. \n\nI hope your son never speaks to you again.", "YTA. Big time. By the way I\u2019m autistic too it\u2019s even worse because we take things literally and are highly aware of injustices. It\u2019s just cruel.", "This cannot be for real. I mean, it just can't.

You absolutely manipulated him.", "Do you really NOT see how you are the biggest TA in the universe?  Seriously you lied to your kid and now you're annoyed because he called you on BS and doesn't want to speak to or be around you.

You'd be the AH for making a promise you had no intention of keeping, but you get bonus points for doing it to an autistic teen.

It\u2019s been 5 months after this incident and he still didn\u2019t text or call me. My ex called me about this situation and told me that i put myself in this position and that she doesn\u2019t have my back. The only thing i wanted is that my son got good grades.

You could have promised him a new phone or a  pizza party. But from your tone, you probably would have broken those promises too.  You seem  to think that the end  justifies  the means; as long as the poor kid got his grades up,  it doesn't matter what nasty,  manipulative  lie you told him.\n\nSadly, by breaking his heart, you also tarnished the joy he felt at achieving his good grades.

Your son expects people to do what they say they will do especially when tied to something he has to do. They typically thrive in routine and become obsessive about certain things.
