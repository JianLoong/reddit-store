Keep the ring simple as you don't want to spend a lot on side diamonds and sacrifice the center quality. The engagement ring itself can be upgraded years later. 5 or 10 year anniversary present.

They also invested heavily in the marketing that convinced people (especially in the US) that engagement rings MUST have diamonds (which was not the case before); the 3 month salary \"rule\" also came like that. Nowadays, when lab diamonds are identical to mined ones, the same companies are trying to convince people that they're worth less. Personally, I think you have to be either stupid or delusional to fall for it.", "He could always buy an antique stone. I saw a 1.88ct VVS2, G, old European cut round diamond for $7k recently.", "Yup.  The three-month rule was created by De Beers, the diamond monopoly.", "More like almost her entire post tax salary.", "I get your point, but it's really gross to act like women are interchangeable and that if he's mad at his gf he should just go to a sex worker. it's deeply misogynistic, and you can express your point better", "I would hope that a 6k ring wouldn't stain or give problems\nHere a $500 ring would be cheap but wouldn't stain", "a decent human being would never say \"the ring is too cheap\".\n\na good partner opens up a discussion and finds a mutual agreement, which OP already did. his partner broke the agreement wanting a ring costs 6-month of his salary.\n\nno, that's no \"plastic\", more like a walking red flag and a bullet waiting to be dodged lmao.", ">OP: $150k per year + bonus  \n>  \n>the partner: $60k/year, has virtually no savings  \n>  \n>original ring: $6.5k  \n>  \n>\"wanted\" ring: $37.5k\n\nOP was nowhere near \"cheap out\". if you consider him and the above numbers \"cheap\", i feel bad for your \"amazing\" partner for having to keep up such a high standard for years.\n\nand i want to point out one more thing: don't apply your spending habit / level on other strangers like this. you don't even know what was their budget. it's very out of touch and inconsiderate.", "Diamond rings are like new cars; as soon as you take possession, they lose 30% of their value. The retail markup n engagement rings is insane, a loan shark would blush. And rings can be lost, broken or stolen.", "Ok, but she picked out the ring and he got her exactly what she wanted and then she looked up an outdated rule from a DeBeers ad and decided the ring she picked out wasn\u2019t expensive enough. That\u2019s different from having expensive taste in rings.", "Or they will divorce soon because golddiggers following golddigger friends advices are draining.", "I think the difference between you and OP\u2019s partner is that you\u2019re clear on what you want, and your husband understands it. But OP and his partner actually agreed on what she was looking for, but then she changed her mind and saying the ring she asked for is actually not up to her standard.\n\nIf OP went and bought a ring by himself without his partner\u2019s input, I\u2019d understand why he could be TA. But it would mean they might not be compatible. But in reality, OP\u2019s partner\u2019s unhappiness is caused by how her friends commented on her ring, and her image more than what they\u2019ve agreed on and was satisfied. And that\u2019s the difference.", "Well, if he was earning 2+ million a year, then it wouldn\u2019t be so disproportionate to his income.

You can make 37.5k(12.5k a month) and only net 8k a month. So it\u2019s really almost half a year of salary. The ring is basically her yearly salary and she feels entitled to it. I\u2019ve never understood people who are materialistic but can\u2019t even afford what they demand", "Yep. My husband has very good salary comparing to other people. He spent about one salary on ring. I can't even tell people how much it costed because for common people it's insane amount of money spent for piece of jewelry. And it's \"only\" 0,5 ct mined diamond (salaries here are way lower here, diamonds cost the same as us though...). OP is absolutely NTA.", "I'd be too scared to wear it for fear of losing it.", "It\u2019s not even worth $38,000 on your finger. The moment the ring is handed over to you, it loses almost all of its value. \n\nNo jewellery / pawn shop is going to buy it back at anywhere near the price you paid.", "That would be a great down payment on a house. I'm much happier in my payed for house, and paid for cars than impressing people. OP here's your warning. You don't want to spend the rest of your life paying to satisfy her. Run", "To your job that pays you 60k.\n\nFinancially responsible!", "No can do. The one I ordered came as a 3 piece set (engagement and wedding bands for both). I dropped 23 bucks after coupon and I love them.\n\nNow if only I could find them (I took them off to shower so they wouldn't get caught in my hair and now I can't find them)\n\nI'm not mad because I'm not much for jewelry.\n\nNow if he dropped 38K on landscaping tools, I would be excited.\ud83e\udd23", "An aunt whom I generally get on with told me once, maybe 20 years ago, that the engagement ring conveys to other people know how much your husband/ spouse loves you.

I wanted something that wouldn\u2019t catch on anything and it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world if it got lost.

Fianc\u00e9 demanding that much of a ring is either a gold digger or selling herself\u2026but I guess both options are selling herself.

It depends on how much your household income is. If your household income is 500k+, it isn\u2019t unreasonable to want that, since it\u2019s actually budgeted and not affecting your lifestyle. But with their salaries in a VHCOL place, the 37.5k is basically an entire year of saving for him.

They pay you for the gold and a little extra for the diamond.\n\nJust tell her the ring you chose is final every time she brings it up, end of story.\nDon't play childish games like ultimatums or anything like that. Setting this (financial) boundary is enough, and if she respects it or nor will tell you everything you need to know.", "I found my engagement ring at a jewellers who sold secondhand rings \n\nThe diamond quality size and gold meant it was worth \u00a34k if bought new \n\nWe bought it for \u00a3400 plus another \u00a3200 in resizing so \u00a3600 in total \n\nAt no point do I ever look at that ring and think anything other than it\u2019s a beautiful ring in the exact style I wanted and what a bargain we got for it", "OP says they don't have any debt......yet! Boy will they have debt!!", "Yep, she's showing him who she is.", "I disagree with her, but I think a more reasonable explanation is that she thinks the value of the ring reflects how much he values her, because of horrible misogynistic advertising about rings, etc. women are taught to be fixated on it as showing how much he values her, which I think is what she's actually hung up on. she needs to process that, but saying she's just with him for his money is out of line.", "I understand your point re household income but both people should be on the same page re money priorities. The different viewpoints would give me pause.", "I think your reasonable explanation is pretty much nuts. Frankly\u2026it isn\u2019t any of her business how much it cost because it was a gift. She got her pick of style, 4Cs, etc\u2026and he got her what she asked for. But now her friends (gee, glad they aren\u2019t my friends) convinced her to demand he spend half of her salary\u2026and she agrees with them.

I\u2019m not saying that finances should or should not be separate or that spouses of either gender help support the other spouse\u2026but with their difference in income she wants to spend his money, which he may or may not be happy with as opposed to spending it on something more meaningful. I don\u2019t know if her age was mentioned\u2026but as an adult it isn\u2019t unreasonable to expect her to realize and recognize that the 2x or 3x or whatever the ring budget is \u201csupposedly to be is marketing BS and plan on more reasonable financial outlays. Is she going to epwear a 9K ring to her 60K a year job? If she does\u2026she will be perceived as bragging I think\u2026so it\u2019s going to likely stay in the box except for special occasions. Engagement rings should be worn\u2026my wife has had her original one off maybe 10 times in 47 years and the additional one I gave her in 2004 after 10,000 days married even less than that. I spent less than 4K on both of them\u2026because neither of us would be comfortable with spending 3 months of my salary after college on one instead of say rent, car, and necessities.", "yeah, I think what happened is friends being like \"oh  that little!\" or some nonsense like that. the same thing that drives consumption of luxury bags or fancy watches or other just pure branding products, and they absolutely need to figure out how to align their financial goals and values here (especially bc lab diamonds don't involve actual slavery and child labor to mine, and are 100% th best choice for so many reasons)"]}
