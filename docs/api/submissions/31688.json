If she wants you to spend that much on the ring, what will she expect to be spent on the wedding?!\nLike you, I come from a relatively poor family. I am nowhere near either of your earnings, definitely on the lower end of the income scale but still much higher income than my parents. Growing up poor, I value financial stability so much and I think that\u2019s a common feeling for most adults in the same situation. I am frugal and able to manage my money well and as a result I have a nice (if relatively small) home and some savings, plus a few little luxuries.

She cares more about looking wealthy than being well setup in life. You're going to spend the rest of your life arguing with her when she wants to blow money on dumb things. Just end it now.", "Eh depends Ive seen on Reddit where the person said 75 was what they paid for an engagement ring that's definitely too cheap", "Yep. Cheaper weddings mean longer marriages! I'm sure same goes for someone wanting to waste more money on a damn ring. \n\nWho wants to walk around with 30k on their finger anyway? Show offs,  that's who. For her friends, not her marriage. What a great start!\n\nMy ring isn't worth much, never even had a wedding, and guess who still act like newlywed best friend lovers every single day after 20 years of knowing eachother? Then guess who will be divorced after 5?", "Yeah! Where is this dude's $15K engagement watch.", "Only do this if you're willing to accept that she's totally happy to actually buy you one. Otherwise you'll look really silly.", "Good grief - think of all the up-sells her friends are going to try to convince her she needs for the wedding!!\n\nNTA.  If her #1 priority is telling people how much you spent on her - not good.  At all.", "It's worth spending a moderate amount of money on a ring because it's jewelry she will wear for the rest of her life. A very cheap ring is likely to have a coating over a cheaper metal that will show up over time/turn her finger green/cause an allergic reaction. Non-gemstones don't last super well either: my own ring has a cubic zirconium which I had to replace after about 5 years and has gotten scratched badly and needs replacing again. I think I'm getting a moissanite this time: from what I've read, they sparkle very nicely and should be hard enough to last. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, to get a ring that will last a lifetime, it can cost several hundred to a thousand dollars, more if you want real diamonds. I don't think it's unreasonable for a woman to expect a financially stable boyfriend to invest $1,000-2,000 on a ring she will wear for the rest of her life. (If money is tight, then the price range will obviously need to drop.)\n\n  \nBut. $6,500 is already WAY tons for a ring. $37,000 is literally what the down payment for my house was. She is way out of line.", "My wife picked out her own engagement ring on Etsy.  It was $400.", "This here. If you truly love each other, there should be a mutual understanding that spending a lot on a ring is a waste of money when you will eventually have more pressing expenses in the future (house, cars, vacations, kids, etc.).\n\nWhen I married my wife, I was just starting in the corporate world and maybe had $2k in savings, she knew this and instead went and bought the wedding ring she wanted with her own money (she has never hounded me for the money, but I did upgrade the ring a couple of years ago). We also realized that having a large wedding was costly, so we instead had a court marriage. We are debt free and happily married for 10 years with a 5 year old son.", "If I\u2019m going to wear it forever it should be both beautiful and high quality. Being proposed to with a cheaply made ring of low quality materials would make me feel like he didn\u2019t think I was worth the same dignity that all other women are gifted by their fianc\u00e9s. 37k is way above that ceiling, but wanting something nice that will last is an ok expectation. \n\nThe ring OP picked out seems like it will more than meet that.", "Wearing a 1/2 carat ring my hubby could afford 25 years ago and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. It\u2019s the ring he chose and gave me and it means everything to me.", "Exactly. I had no ring when I proposed. We only bought them quite some time later.", "Sis needs a major reality check and this dude needs to run. $6k is still a *very expensive* ring. Your average person will likely never own anything that expensive, save a car and a house. And this is just a tiny rock you wear that serves no real purpose. \n\nMine cost $400 and I remember being a little miffed with my husband he spent so much.", "Why not buy a lab-grown diamond?", "Why do her friends even know how much the ring cost? How  gauche to tell everyone what your fianc\u00e9 spent\u2014whether a little or a lot.", "Honestly if it's not given with love or rather resentment what's the point..", "We bought our rings at a booth at a medieval faire for less than $50 for 3 rings. They don't stain and I've worn my set for over 15 years. He doesn't wear his because of his job, but he knows where it is when he wants to wear it.", "They could have 1 reasonably ok wedding for that price too!/s /jk", "Agreed. My husband and I make a combined salary higher than OP's and even a $6,000 ring seems excessive to me.", "My husband didn\u2019t get me a diamond. He got me a variety of quartz that has a lot of emotional significance to his side of the family. He\u2019s asked me a few times if I wanted my setting converted to diamonds now that we can afford them and I always say no!", "The price of lab grown diamonds are declining \n\nIt\u2019s the equivalent of buying a fake Rolex. This is my personal opinion, I know not everyone will agree", "Me, too. Absolutely nuts to spend that much on a ring, if for no other reason, I\u2019d be paranoid about losing it or being a target for thieves.", "Yea, next it will be the million dollar house", "The cost of a whole ass car", "I would be terrified to actually wear it. I tried on a $32k yellow diamond ring for fun (when we were buying an anniversary band). While it was gorgeous, I just couldn\u2019t wear that on my finger every day. THAT would be the ring I\u2019d lose.", "I would be so uncomfortable with $40k on my hand. Too easy to lose or get stolen. I lost my first wedding ring swimming, I can\u2019t imagine if it had cost three months of my husband\u2019s salary.", "(It\u2019s actually only \u00a3144 if you\u2019re interested)", "Becouse it's always easy to look rich when someone else pays and wraps it up in \"but don't I deserve it?\" Or the god old.\"Don't you love me? If you loved me, you would.....\" \n\nIt has become worse with stuff like tiktok, all the reality shows with people that are rich because, well, people made them rich. \nYoung girls see all this stuff, and \"it's so unfair that's not me! I'm pretty, too!\" And feels like they are owed all this stuff. \nMen aren't immune to it either. \nSome are going as far as blaming their parents they aren't rich. \n\nIt's \"me me me me\"", "Completely agree. \n\nI would keep it locked up in a bank box. If I should be completely honest. I would be a nerve wreck wearing it.", "Do you mean one paycheck (not one salary)?", "There are groups of people who love using metal detectors that will come out and sweep the area for you.", "My engagement earrings (I don't like engagement rings lol) were $1200 that I wear maybe 5 times a year because I'm terrified I'm going to love them.\n\nMy wedding ring is an \u00a380 silver ring purchased when we were visiting Shetland, and is a replicate of the Stones of Stenness (like, the \"band\" has the stones shaped around it).\n\nI can't even wrap my head around wearing $38,000 on any part of my body lol", "Oh that's gross. Guess the world must think my husband hates me since I wear rotating $100 Stirling silver Pandora rings in place of my cannot be resized again \"proper\" ring set. Which only cost $1000, I better go ask him if he *really* loves me at all. \ud83d\ude2d", "Ding ding ding!!", "He said in the post they were looking at 4 carat diamonds. Unless she is an amazon woman with huge hands I can't imagine it not looking crazy.", "Correct. She is assigning value based on the opinions of her girl squad, or her perception of their opinions. \n\nWhat next? The house in just the right neighborhood, the right kind of car, the right country club, what (?) she still has to work??? Is this a marriage or an instagram post? Which matters more, how you feel about each other, or how she ranks with her girls. 6.5k on a lab diamond ring is a damn nice ring! \n\nI\u2019d recommend putting off the wedding for at least two years. In that time, get some premarital counseling, have detailed conversations and agreements on financial matters. Watch her attitude while you wait."]}
