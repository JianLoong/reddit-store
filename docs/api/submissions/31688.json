We live in a VHCL area. I make good money (around $150k per year + c. $50k in bonuses) and have a good amount of savings. She makes less than me (around $60k) and has virtually no savings. Neither of us has any debt. I am from a relatively poor family so I\u2019m feeling a bit of pressure from the big expenses likely to be coming up (i.e. wedding, purchasing a house) which I will be doing without parental help.\n\n\r  \nMy girlfriend and I talked a lot about our future together and we are both on the same page about getting married in the near future. We recently spent a good amount of time thinking about her engagement ring. The style, type of cut, 4 Cs, lab vs mined etc. We were both quite unknowledgeable about diamonds so had to do a lot of research.\n\n\r  \nShe was aware that lab diamonds were much cheaper than mined diamonds and expressed that she was happy to go for that as it would mean she could get a much higher quality ring than otherwise. We also went out to a few places to try different options on her finger, after which she decided on her dream ring. I never gave her a particular budget for the ring because I had done research on lab diamonds and knew that I could likely afford whatever she wanted. She has a habit of not really looking at the prices of things so I am quite certain at this stage she didn\u2019t fully understand just how much cheaper lab diamonds were vs mined diamonds.\n\n\r  \nSince she had now decided on the ring she wanted, I went out separately and bought a lab diamond ring for c. $6.5k that matches exactly what she decided on.\n\n\r  \nOver the last few weeks, my girlfriend has probably been researching on her own a bit more and also speaking with friends about the prices of lab diamonds and has come to the conclusion that the ring I\u2019m getting for her will be too cheap. She is now quoting the 3 month salary rule (i.e. for me that means I need to be spending c. $37.5k on a ring). I spoke with her on multiple occasions about how spending less on a ring means that we will have more money for the wedding itself / honeymoon and a house when we get around to purchasing one. However as soon as she spends time with her friends the topic comes up again and we end up arguing.\n\n\r  \nWhat frustrates me about the situation is that she seems hell-bent on spending more money for the sake of spending money. The ring will be exactly like what she picked out and she was incredibly happy before she knew what the price was likely to be. This has been going on for a few weeks now and honestly I am starting to have doubts creep into my mind about whether I want to go ahead with the proposal if she is materialistic enough to place more importance on a ring than the strength of our relationship.\n\n\r  \nTLDR: I am getting my girlfriend a ring that meets all the specifications she selected, but after finding out the price is likely to be less than she expected and is now upset.

There's already the expectation that you are paying for whole house and whole wedding etc?\n\nShe got to pick out her own excessively ring, then figured she could have demanded something even more excessive. \n\nShe sounds materialistic as hell. \n\nI'd take a little bit to ask yourself if she's even the type of person you want to spend your life with. What happens if you can't afford her anymore?", "Red flags everywhere! NTA 37.5k is absolutely absurd at your income.", "The three month rule was created by advertisers. It is not a rule.

But I AM telling you that I\u2019m giving your fianc\u00e9e some serious side eye for thinking you\u2019re not \u201cspending enough\u201d on a ring. I mean, if she wants to walk around wearing something that is the cost of a new Camry on the daily but could slip down a drain, I guess that\u2019s her call\u2026 I\u2019m also just not impressed by people being so easily swayed by DeBeer\u2019s marketing tactics.", "NTA. It's really a shame that the two of you found a ring that she loved.... until she talked to her friends and they said that the ring should have cost more. I don't know if you can still reach her underneath the weight of the wedding industrial complex she's getting buried under to get her back to her original standpoint.

If she is offended by whatever ring you take the time to buy,  you might end up dodging a bullet bigtime by not marrying at all. If you do go forward with this bird, get a pre nup please. If she expects this sort of ring, I can only imagine the following expectations of \"destination wedding,\" the type of house in a big pretty bow, and the SUV she will want hauling your kids to Montessori before her yoga and basket weaving/scrap booking classes.\n\nMy opinion only. Nta", "Nta let her go if that is the case.  Is she also following the rule bride's parents pays for the wedding?", "NTA. She is showing you that she unashamedly perceives any interaction no matter what it is, as primarily financial in nature.

How can she be happy with the ring until her friends tell her otherwise. Are they really friends or secretly enemies? Not everyone around us is happy for our blessings and she is a fool to pay them any mind. \nYou also need to decide if you want to allow her so called friends to dictate things in your relationship. If this is a common pattern, believe it will continue into the wedding planning and your future. Don\u2019t make any rash decisions but take time to reflect and then decide on how you can talk to explain your views. Communicate but also you may want to hold off the engagement until you are in the same page about outside influences.", "NTA. Put all wedding plans on hold until you are on the same page about finances, and/or so you can decide whether you want to spend your life with a woman who will decide that exactly what she wanted isn't good enough because it doesn't have an arbitrarily inflated price tag.", "37k on a ring is insanity.", "NTA.\n\nLove is not measured by money.\n\nYour girlfriend needs better friends.\n\nDo not go forward with this relationship unless you are on the same page with finances. It is a huge defining factor on whether a marriage will survive.", "NTA, end the relationship or get a prenup. I am a female who unfortunately had many gold digger friends.
