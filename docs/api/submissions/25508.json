I am married to a 35 years old man who works in a bank while I an a doctor and I work the early shift in my hospital. Because I work early shift I come back come at 4-4:30 pm and wake up 5am. My husband wakes up around 9am but retunes home around 7-8 pm. My salary is around 7k and my husband\u2019s is around the same number . Our rent pay is (we are not from America so this is equivalency) 15k every 5 months so it is not a monthly rent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t pay or contribute any of the rent and my husband recently asked me to help him and I refused. Here is a thing. I wake up at 5am come myself breakfast, then cook both my husband and kid breakfast and lunch and pack them. I end cooking around 5:45 then I wake my son up to get ready for school and eat pack his lunch and stuff then I myself get ready to work. I drop off my son to school around 6:30 then I head to work as my shift starts 7 am end 3:30 pm. While on my way I pickup my son head home rest for a bit then start doing chores, cook dinner , check school work with my son and if he has football practice I am the one who drives him, waits for him and take him home. So basically I handle everything around the house except money.The reason I don\u2019t want to contribute even though I most definitely can is that I do everything else alone with 0 contribution on his part. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told my husband if he wants us to split money 50/50 then we should split everything else 50/50 him handling money alone is the only thing I use to convince myself that I am not a single mother. He told me he can\u2019t because he comes home late so he isn\u2019t physically there to help even though on days off he rarely do the dishes and when he does that\u2019s because I\u2019ve asked him at least 4 times to do them.His problem is that he is not saving up so much money like I am (I have my investments). I told him if I am going to do everything when it comes to our house and our child and pay then I can just take my son and live alone. He always find food, clean house , clean clothes, flourishing son , all things he never contributed in but still has.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say our fight escalated and he called me a selfish greedy woman who wants to keep money to all myself a and told me he isn\u2019t paying the next rent until I give him half of it. I told him I am not paying and if he does that I will take my son to my parents old house (which I own legally now) and start the single mother life for real. We have been cold as ice this past 2 weeks he called my sister and my sister and been complaining to her he really wants me to pay but won\u2019t try to work out the situation where he\u2019ll start acting like a husban\n\n\nEdit\n\nNo we can\u2019t have a nanny because he doesn\u2019t like them.

A conversation about making me do 95% while he does 5% won\u2019t have any good outcome it is outlandish.", "He doesn\u2019t like nannys because his mother had one that stole from them.", "Yeah that\u2019s what this community is about", "There is something called days off that he gets I already mentioned them. I work too and bring myself to do everything. He refused a nanny. He refused to choose a job that suits him as a married man and father despite having the options. \n\n\nHe thinks I am his unpaid maid taking care of his shit so how is that better than rent free? At least I am not the one who chose this route. He did when he decided to value a fucking job over his family.\n\nIf my working hours were that simple why isn\u2019t be doing them? Oh he will when I leave anyway", "Ah, no worries, thanks!", "It depends. He might be afraid of being shamed for being a terrible and absent father so he'll do the bare minimum like weekly visits for a few hours. If he doesn't, you get to decide what you'll do all the time and it's amazing. My ex doesn't have any contact at the moment and it's very chill. My kid and I have adventures all the time, we do whatever we feel like and have loads of fun. I would like breaks but knowing he's safe is worth it for me, and I could get a nanny down the line if needed. \n\nYour kid is school aged so it's even easier to manage alone - mine it's only 3 so it's intense but it won't last forever. \n\nBut yeah, he's very self centred so right now it's only about his needs not being met by you anymore. That's 100% a him problem and you're doing the right thing by removing yourself and your kid from the environment. You're showing your son that healthy relationships are equitable and reciprocal and that it's OK to leave if that isn't the case. He'll be a better man for watching you make this decision.", "Is he giving me money? No he pays for house and power he uses so not just something for me solely. Plus if I am the \u201cpaid nanny\u201d now since when paid nannies pay rent?", "I don't think it would work out as neatly in real life as on paper. There's the fact that you are already working a high-stress fulltime job already and it seems she would just prefer them to both split household chores than be compensated for them financially.", "I was with you and gonna vote n-t-a until you decided to downplay finances. Him completely supporting the family while you sock away all your salary and investment income isn't a small thing either. ESH you BOTH need to figure out how to take care of your son, the house, and the finances together. You're a team. Otherwise, just divorce and both of you can each do the money thing and the parent thing separately.", "You can't be serious.", "Divorce hasn\u2019t finalized yet", "you\u2019re a doctor that earns roughly $24K USD annually???", "Threatening repeatedly to take the kid and move out was mature? Repeatedly referring to them as *your* child is mature?", "Fine, that sounds like his problem if he can\u2019t have a nanny, but won\u2019t do any of the work. Then what is he even providing for the family? Clearly does not value your sanity or stress of working and keeping the house", "Correcto", "> His problem is that he is not saving up so much money like I am (I have my investments).\n\nOf course he's not saving up money like you are, he's paying for your rent!", "Unfortunately in my society lazy fathers don\u2019t get shamed.  Also the idea of him doing the visits so the world uploads him is not something I\u2019d put my son in.\n\nIf he decides to visit I\u2019ll let him know if my boy came home sad due to his shitty behavior he won\u2019t see him again. He fucked up with him numerous times I didn\u2019t divorce to see him sad again.", "I don\u2019t think your understanding what I\u2019m saying. \nSo: your role in the house is nanny/housekeeper etc, but your not getting paid for that right? Therefore if you want to actually make it 50/50 you should ask your husband to pay you the wage of a nanny/housekeeper for the amount of hours you do. He\u2019ll then realise that the labour you do around the house is actually worthwhile, because if you weren\u2019t doing it he would have to hire someone to do all that.\n\nTherefore him paying rent, is essentially his way of meeting you 50/50", "No, so I\u2019m trying to explain to her that what she does around the house and for the children is the equivalent of a nanny/housekeeper. This is what the wage gap is based on, women doing these sorts of labour for free because men don\u2019t look at is as worthwhile.\n\nSo her husband is ignoring all this labour she does, so to show him the worth of it, it\u2019s worth working out how much it would cost to pay someone to do that. He would then realise he has a deal with only having to pay rent.\n\nI\u2019m not actually suggesting her husband pay her. It\u2019s about him understanding that her labour should not be free.", "He decided to take that route I didn\u2019t force him into it. It is not like he offered to act like a husband and father and I told him no just handle the money. \n\nMoney is the only thing he does, the only fucking thing and he can\u2019t even do it without playing the victim?", "I am", "If you\u2019re getting divorced that should probably be info in your post??", "> Not in dollars\n\n24K is around 12-15k dollars in my country", "If he doesn\u2019t pay rent because house would be unavailable anyways. \n\nYes when I am the one who takes care of MY child alone and he not for once remembered his birthday or spent some quality time with him then he is MY child. He does nothing to deserve to be called his father.", "the house atm it seems", "Considering he can\u2019t save money, it seems like his entire paycheck. Did she say she pays for anything?", "If you have that legal right then more power to you! You're a great mother and you're doing the right thing for you and your kid", "Oh okay sorry I got the wrong idea my bad.", "OK thanks for the clarification, I think maybe we can agree (although I'm sure he wouldn't) that there would still be a number of intangible factors that would make it even more valuable than the going rate for a nanny/housekeeper. Again thanks for the reply!", "You guys really should just divorce.", "Then you have bigger problems.", " I don\u2019t think my plans affect the actual topic of  responsibilities distribution. I\u2019ll inform those who ask but my argument stands alone regardless of divorce.", "You\u2019re either lying or confused about the conversion. It contradicts information you gave previously. Makes me question some of the other stuff you\u2019re claiming here.", "Based on the conversion, that person said you make 24k USD annually (which based on what you said, would be \\~84k in your currency(", "You sound downright resentful towards your husband. While I understand your frustration about the situation, and anger about him not contributing, the way you talk about this makes me wonder if you even want to solve this.\n\nIf you do, there are more constructive ways to approach this than threatening to leave with your child. \n\nYou do need a better distribution of housework, and I can imagine your anger, frustration, and exhaustion. You sound like you really need a break. Perhaps you can take a vacation, while your husband takes care of your child. It might be a good wake-up call for him to realise how much you do on a daily basis just to keep the house running.", "[deleted]", "Okay, this all sounds *absolutely* reasonable, you\u2019re right.", "If my work was done by a nanny she would quit.", "To be fair, it\u2019s also her kid. Any \u201cintangible factors\u201d that you think make her work worth more money are kind of made moot by the fact that it\u2019s her kid. I\u2019m not saying he shouldn\u2019t consider how much she saves them by taking care of their kid. Just saying we don\u2019t need to exaggerate. She\u2019s already doing a lot.", "I think it absolutely does. Who is getting the house? Are you taking full custody? These answers  would completely change the entire situation because they\u2019re ENTIRELY about the responsibility distribution. \n\nESH.", "Lying about what? I already said how doctors work.\n\n\nAnd you\u2019d be foolish to think 7k in my country would work like 2k in the US. What you guys buy with 2 dollars we buy it with 20 in my country. Currencies aren\u2019t just number difference.", "No \n\nI get 7k a month (2k in usa)\n\nI make 24-26k a year (12-15 in usa)\n\n\nBecause in my country doctors have to do voluntary unpaid work don\u2019t ask me how the government let such stupid law fall in.", "How wouldn\u2019t I be when the moment I gave birth the moment he disappeared?\n\nHe threatened to not pay first will then am I just supposed to comply? It is not like I woke up and threatened to take my child away.\n\nLeave me child with him? No sorry I value my son\u2019s life. Also not like he\u2019ll agree to sit from work to babysit.", "If I leave without finalizing divorce custody might drop. If rent isn\u2019t paid , the house is not available I\u2019d have an excuse to leave without any problems.", "I don't doubt it.", "I don't think her raising her kid should literally be ascribed a monetary value and I believe she doesn't either. They both work fulltime and she would like them to split household duties which he doesn't which leaves her little options. Point is *he* is the one who wanted to make their relationship about economics instead of both being responsible parents.", "The house is rented because neither of us own it. No one is getting the house when I leave he will pay rent if he decides to stay in it.", "im sorry, but you\u2019re very confusing and making it difficult to understand whatever points you\u2019re trying to make.", "Okay I gather from your other comments you want to divorce, and from the anger and resentment you seem to feel towards him, that does seem like it might be the most reasonable solution. My suggestion was for if you are willing to resolve this conflict with him. If you want a divorce, than divorce by all means.", "I am not making a point this is how things work ask the government", "It funny how you are pretending like the problem solution is in my hands or something his demands are audacious for a man who has only one duty and can\u2019t get it down."]}
