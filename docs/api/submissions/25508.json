I am married to a 35 years old man who works in a bank while I an a doctor and I work the early shift in my hospital. Because I work early shift I come back come at 4-4:30 pm and wake up 5am. My husband wakes up around 9am but retunes home around 7-8 pm. My salary is around 7k and my husband\u2019s is around the same number . Our rent pay is (we are not from America so this is equivalency) 15k every 5 months so it is not a monthly rent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t pay or contribute any of the rent and my husband recently asked me to help him and I refused. Here is a thing. I wake up at 5am come myself breakfast, then cook both my husband and kid breakfast and lunch and pack them. I end cooking around 5:45 then I wake my son up to get ready for school and eat pack his lunch and stuff then I myself get ready to work. I drop off my son to school around 6:30 then I head to work as my shift starts 7 am end 3:30 pm. While on my way I pickup my son head home rest for a bit then start doing chores, cook dinner , check school work with my son and if he has football practice I am the one who drives him, waits for him and take him home. So basically I handle everything around the house except money.The reason I don\u2019t want to contribute even though I most definitely can is that I do everything else alone with 0 contribution on his part. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told my husband if he wants us to split money 50/50 then we should split everything else 50/50 him handling money alone is the only thing I use to convince myself that I am not a single mother. He told me he can\u2019t because he comes home late so he isn\u2019t physically there to help even though on days off he rarely do the dishes and when he does that\u2019s because I\u2019ve asked him at least 4 times to do them.His problem is that he is not saving up so much money like I am (I have my investments). I told him if I am going to do everything when it comes to our house and our child and pay then I can just take my son and live alone. He always find food, clean house , clean clothes, flourishing son , all things he never contributed in but still has.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say our fight escalated and he called me a selfish greedy woman who wants to keep money to all myself a and told me he isn\u2019t paying the next rent until I give him half of it. I told him I am not paying and if he does that I will take my son to my parents old house (which I own legally now) and start the single mother life for real. We have been cold as ice this past 2 weeks he called my sister and my sister and been complaining to her he really wants me to pay but won\u2019t try to work out the situation where he\u2019ll start acting like a husban\n\n\nEdit\n\nNo we can\u2019t have a nanny because he doesn\u2019t like them.

Not if he's step dad", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s the father of this child, so I don\u2019t know that asking him to pay for half of childcare is a reasonable ask.\n\nBut all chores should be 50/50\n\nEdit: If the kid is his, obviously he should be contributing. But based on the verbiage she uses in her post, it really seems like he\u2019s a stepfather. It\u2019s a lot of \u201cmy son\u201d and not \u201cour son\u201d.", "This post is super fake.", "She refers to her son as our child at least once, but yeah, I didn't think it sounded like he was the dad either.", "Firstly i did say BOTH of you should be doing both things. However, You Knew what he did for work. You were aware of his time requirements and yet you both chose to have kids regardless. The kids are everyones responsibility because youre their parent. If youre there when they need stuff more then thats just how it is. You dont get to hold a basic responsibility over him like its you working another job to contribute. You can hire a cleaning service to come in and pick up every once a week or every few weeks. They are supervised and if anything is stolen its super simple to report and get resolved. Your husband not liking them is his issue. It makes yalls life easier so he can get over it. That said you absolutely should still be contributing. And everyone brings up you being a doctor because for most places that would mean you are earning far more than 7k a month. Typical dr pay in the states is about 1-2k per working day. This is likely why the multiple comments mentioning your job. Having realized you arent in the states that is crazy that you make so little for medicine, but again. Not your husbands fault. Your a dr and arent mature enough to realize that every single part of your marriage should be shared? Finances included. If you cant share financial resources with your spouse then just be single. Its the same thing", "Is he the child\u2019s biological father?", "I believe she says \u201cour child\u201d once, but says \u201cmy\nSon\u201d in every other instance.", "She does clarify that the kid is also her husband's kid in the comments.\n\nI think English might not be her native language. She says she's from East Asia.", "I live in Thailand. Yes. You can. Also if your partner is an ongoing government employer they could even get terminated", "I stand corrected.", "Actually, after reading the majority of her comments, I think this post is fake.", "Wow, thats intense. I like it. I live in the UK & our politicians are regularly having affairs & nothing really happens lool", "why do you think that?"]}
