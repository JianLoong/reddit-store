So to me it seems like the mother is intentionally trying to antagonize OPs husband and her not backing him up undermines their own relationship. \n\nI had a courthouse wedding, there are stipulations on when they do them. The thing is if one courthouse doesn\u2019t match your schedule you can go to another if there are more in your area (my city has 5 that I know of and only one had a slot around the time my wife and I wanted).

I certainly hope your mom is able to celebrate 15 and 20 too, but that's a heck of a treat if both parties make it that far.  \n\nAnd apart from big milestones, anniversaries aren't much of a conflict because it's not typical for couples to celebrate their anniversaries with other people.

I am having a hard time understanding why your husband is so disturbed just because your mom wants to get married on the same date. Unless every anniversary you have he invites your whole family over and is worried that you have to share the limelight then it just doesn't make sense.", "NTA, he's being a total drama queen over nothing. You're quite right that no one owns the date, why should he care?", "Anniversary's are for the couple to celebrate their love for each other, it won't be like y'all will be doing things together on anniversary day, your husband is being childish. MOST importantly is this is your MOTHER, she's 71 and people way younger are dropping like fly's. I have a few regrets on how I was to my mom at times growing up and  I think about would of, could of and should of's all the time, Wish I could go back and appreciate her more, we don't get a do over in life though.

Every year you will be able to ask, \"So, what are you two doing to celebrate this year?

If shes not flexible than bring it up to new hubby as a way for him to make his new family happy. if the answer us no, something else is wrong with her/your husband/her new husband.

You are correct in that you don\u2019t \u201cown\u201d that day, but I understand why your husband is upset. What if you want to throw a big party for your 25th anniversary? Will it be expected to make it a joint celebration? \n\nIt might be worthwhile to mention this to your mom and ask if she could choose another day. If this a whirlwind romance maybe it hasn\u2019t occurred to her that this is your wedding anniversary and it may upset you or your husband to get married on that day. It\u2019s a courthouse wedding, so having it a day earlier or later shouldn\u2019t be too much to ask. \n\nIf she stands firm on the date that\u2019s her choice. Perhaps your husband will still be upset, but knowing you asked he might feel better. If he still doesn\u2019t want to go to the wedding don\u2019t push him.

The only thing here that would annoy me is if your mom didn't throw in a 'happy anniversary, hon!' at some point.

He now has to compete with OPs mother, and he's probably worried his wife will always choose her mother because I can hear the guilt trip from here.", "Yes, his reaction does seem a tad dramatic. Maybe, he\u2019s ultra sensitive? \ud83e\udd14", "We get a few texts and my ILS give us a card. I will tell my ILs Happy Anniversary if I see them. Or I will comment if someone posts their on FB.\n\nBut I really don\u2019t expect anyone to care about my anniversary, other than my husband. I don\u2019t even expect my kids to care.", "is it an hour? is there dinner after? celebrations that would be expected for family? even courthouse weddings often include these after-events. \n\nso they can't celebrate their anniversary because this mom deliberately got married on the same day?", "I'm saying it's pretty ageist to ask why an older person would want to be married. Same reason someone in their 50s would want to be.", "idk, we haven't seen anything from OP indicating that they would give up any more of their anniversary than the 10 minute ceremony at the courthouse plus travel time. seems like a bit of a stretch to me that OP would have competing interests in how to spend their time.\n\nI'm a lot more inclined to think that OPs mom didn't realize that she picked the same date as her daughter and is non-plussed because she sees it as a non-issue.", "Certainly possible. Who knows, maybe he has some elaborate surprise set up for that day and the wedding is spoiling it.", "That would be okay for the actual wedding day, but what happens after that? Will they be expected to go over there every year to celebrate the Mom\u2019s anniversary instead of celebrating their own? Def ask for a change of date.", "There were four couples celebrating their wedding anniversary at my wedding. It\u2019s not like life stops for anyone for that one day.", "OP says she talked with her mother about the dates offered, and her mother still picked their anniversary as her wedding date. So I'm pretty sure her mother already knew it was their anniversary.", "That is a logical hypothesis.", "Why would they be expected to do that? Is that something parents expect of their adult children? My parents divorced before I was an adult, but my dad and step mom never demanded our attendance on their anniversary.\n\nWe don\u2019t even give my ILs a card for theirs, although I think they give us one for ours. We\u2019ve certainly never been expected to celebrate it with them. Except for their 50th. But that\u2019s the obvious exception. \n\nA wedding would take precedence over an anniversary. Go out a different night, it\u2019s not that hard. \n\nThe mom may have thought it would be neat to share an anniversary with her daughter and SIL.", "I\u2019ve never heard of going to someone\u2019s house to spend their anniversary with them. Like I\u2019m sure it happens, but that\u2019s not exactly common", "Exactly. It's one day, they'll survive going to OP's mother's wedding and party this one time.", "^she knew. OP has been married over 20 years. It\u2019s just an ah move by the mom", "no, OP said that her mother knew it was her anniversary in the post. in a comment she said it was one of four slots offered by the courthouse.\n\nShe never said she sat down and talked with her mom about it before they booked the date.\n\nidk, it just seems like a more realistic scenario to me that mom booked the date not realizing it was OPs anniversary, when called out she was embarrassed and said she didn't think it was a big deal. That makes a lot more sense to me than Mom having a good relationship with OP and going completely out of character to intentionally upset OP + SO.", "IDK\u2026we went with my in-laws to celebrate their anniversary with them all the time. Not a demand, simply a routine we got into\u2026dinner at their place, ours, out, etc. \n\nDifferent strokes I guess. \ud83d\ude0a"]}
