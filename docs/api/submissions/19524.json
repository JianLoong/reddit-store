I was in charge of making coffee since the lady that usually makes it was off the other night. I made the coffee at 930pm whenever I first got there, switched the old for the new and went on with my night.\n\nFast forward an hour, one of my coworkers walks out into the dining area where I am sweeping and asks if I made fresh coffee - of course I answered yes, they should still be piping hot (coffee holders we use holds coffee at high temps for 4+ hours). With a straight face she looks at me and says \"You're lying.\" \n\nI'm sorry?? I'm lying to you about coffee? Yeah, that seems smart. So she walks me to the back and puts her finger in a small cup of coffee. \"What does this prove?\" \n\nSo, the lead had apparently made a small cup of coffee and put 4 creamers into his cup (his usual is SIX, so I'd believe that over 4) and then said it was ice cold. The creamers are cold. Also, there is a small glass tube that the coffee sits in to be distributed to the cups, it's a bit hard to explain but it's there so you can tell how full the coffee is. You can imagine the coffee gets pretty cold sitting in thin glass for an hour, plus being paired with cold creamer. Well, neither coworkers wanted to listen to me, so what did my smart self do?\n\nI temped the coffee.\n\nI stuck a thermometer into a fresh cup from the SAME pot he had just gotten his cup from and it temped at a crazy 150\u00b0 F. I showed both of them, and the entire night after that they wouldn't speak to me (which thank God) but the next night the lead tried to get me to do a job he knows I don't like, but of course if I need to I'll do it. And he had that smug look on his face about it to. \n\nSo here I ask, AITA?", "created_utc": 1686475814, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146phw9/aita_for_temping_the_coffee_at_work/", "score": 15, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
