Since I had made it clear I don\u2019t want to spend time with my ex and her new family I was seen as causing a problem so they just didn\u2019t tell me about it.  One of my siblings let it slip accidentally on Christmas Eve that they were all there without me, making it clear everyone felt it was my fault I could be invited.  It was deviating to feel like I was being excluded from my own family yet again.  To be lied to yet again.   \n\nMuch to my shock on the original post I was judged NTA; and it made me see much of my entire life\u2019s interactions with my family differently.  \n\nFollow up:  \n\n1)  As suggested I started going low contact; essentially I just stopped trying to maintain the contact with them and let them do all the work there\u2026.which they haven\u2019t so low contact has been in essence no contact.  Which has both sucked and been healthier for me.  I don\u2019t even know what they are doing for Christmas this year\u2026.which is actually easier then knowing they are doing something and choosing to excluding me.  \n\n2) I did print out some of the post from last year and showed them to my therapist as suggested.  He berated me for listening to people on the internet and cutting off a \u201cvital part\u201d of my support system.  After 2 months of weekly appointments listening to him talk about ways to fix the relationship and apologize to my family and make amends with them; I just stopped making appointments with him.  That was in March.  \n\n3) After stopping contact with my family and therapist I found I had a really hard time (super anxious and second guessing every interaction) even being around my friends so I\u2019ve kinda stopped seeing them either.\n\nI had a good WFH job so I just started working all the time.  It was good for my career and I got a major promotion in Q3; it was a large enough promo that I don\u2019t stress about money anymore, which was a constant stressed before. So spending my energy somewhere other then on my family has been life changing.", "created_utc": 1672070569, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvq64o/update_not_wanting_my_parents_to_be_involved_in/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Ok. I am gonna be honest with you. Super proud for chosing to put yourself first. Your \"family\" are really a bunch of narcistic aholes. Second. WTH is wrong with your therapist! That is some 1st grade bullshit that he/she has been telling you! A good therapist should and would never tell you to appologize. Gah. Some people need there license revoked! He/she should have recommended going no contact a looong time a go!  I can only applaud you for not goibg to them anymore! But please. Please find a new and good therapist or a support group to help you. Try talking to your friends, but only if they support you going no contact with family and therapist. That should be a goof indicator if they are good friends. Good friends wil support you no mattet what! Please take care of youself. You are worth it! And to hell with yout parents and family for putting you through this! Even your ex! She should be ashamed of herself! Again please take care of youself! Hope the new year wil bring you joy, strenght and happiness!", "I\u2019m proud of you OP. Continue staying no contact with all of them. My God, I can\u2019t believe how they\u2019ve chosen your ex over you, their own son, brother. It\u2019s a shame. However, this is best for your mental health. Talk to your friends and tell them what has been going on and why you\u2019ve stepped back from them. Give them a chance to be just that, a friend. Socialize more to make new friends, create new memories. I pray you find the woman that\u2019s right for you.", "I am so... so sorry. I cannot think of anything else to say here except \"they are not worth any more seconds in your thoughts moving forward in your life\". I cannot imagine what it felt like for you all these years. My heart feels for you. And I do hope you will be happy in the future. Because there is truth in \"family is who we choose\". Go find them.", "Good for you, that is incredibly toxic. \n\nFind a new therapist. Just like jobs and mates, the very first one or the latest isn't the be all and end all.", "Good for you for prioritizing yourself and getting ahead in your career. But now is the time to balance your life again.  Reach out to your friends with just a \u201chey sorry for going silent, but I was dealing with some pretty consuming things,\u201d.  \n\nFind a new therapist who can just let you talk through your issues and not tell you what to do.  You need to find a healthy perspective on your life before you start being able to live it.\n\nQuite frankly your life seems lonely and one sided.  You WFH, have limited contact with friends and colleagues and no contact with family.  I am some random stranger on the internet, and if you are happy being alone, live your life in happiness and in peace.\n\nBut make sure that is what you really want or are you too scarred to try for human interaction again.  Either way, I wish you well.", "I feel like your family didn\u2019t hear you, like not totally listening to you at all. They\u2019re here for seeing a baby. You mentioned it\u2019s not your child, they failed to hear your voice. \n\nIt made me wondering\u2014 why not order a DNA result?  But you kept saying you knew this and that conception.  Dude, your family didn\u2019t hear you\u2026 \n\nI feel demanding you need to get *proof of DNA result paper*, not your voice.  Since if your family can see a baby then they can **see** the paper instead of listening to you.\n\nI feel bad for you. Your family are horrible.  Anyway as for update, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing great. Keep continuing LC.\n\nPS- glad you changed the therapist.  The old therapist had poor judgments.", "YOu had a crap therapist, but I hope you look for a  new one. I would also see about reaching out to friends again. You have isolated yourself from people who actually do care about you. And just in case you doubt yourself, cutting them off from hurting you was the right choice.", "I am really happy for you. Maybe take one component of your life at one time and work on it, sounds like career wise you are sorted so try and have some good friends or a better therapist for your anxiety. Whatever you do wishing you success and happiness", "Good for you in regards to your family. I do think you should reach out to your friends again though (assuming they are supportive). I don't see any indication they ever did anything wrong and I don't think being totally isolated is helpful for you.", "I followed your comments. You can make new friends. Try adult social groups like https://www.meetup.com/ \n\nYou don't have to tell new people your story right away. Blame any social awkwardness on the pandemic, and try to meet new people. \n\nI am rooting for you!", "so proud of you for taking the many hurtful, but in the end necessary steps to be happier. you got this!!", "Congratulations on the promotion. Even bigger congratulations on taking control of your life\u2026 your family sound horrendous. Whether it\u2019s a complete misplaced religious loyalty (I doubt it), that your ex has lied (possible) or that you\u2019ve always been treated by your family (money is on this as your siblings are behaving terribly too)\u2026\nWhatever the case is, it\u2019s not your fault. Keep away from them. Enjoy your life. Take the other\u2019s advice and find a decent therapist. Talk to your friends. But again, enjoy your life, it\u2019s going to be much better from now on", "I'm very glad to hear you're doing better and in much better emotional shape than before. Is it still too painful to be around your ex?\n\nIf you can avoid wasting energy and emotion being upset her or how people treat her, it seems like you should be able to have more contact with your family. Being isolated and alone all the time isn't healthy.", "I\u2019m just not sure how to talk to a therapist (and probably how to talk to my friends) because it just hard for me to know what to say.  I feel like talking about any of this is just a quick way to end the relationship.  Like they have normal families and just can understand what I\u2019m saying and it just makes me look like an AH.  So I just don\u2019t know what to say and am always anxious about saying anything.  :/  \n\nI do feel like not talking to my family has changed my life a lot for the better, even if it is lonelier.", "I feel like I\u2019ve written and deleted that text to friends so many times.  I just don\u2019t feel like I would know what to say to them.  I don\u2019t feel like any interaction with them would be good?  Productive?  Worth it?  I don\u2019t know.  I guess I just don\u2019t feel like they will understand or care ( any why should they) so don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s even worth trying.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure being alone is what I would choose, but I also don\u2019t feel like I know how to let anyone in anymore.  I guess the reality is once you understand just how much even your parents and siblings see you as disposable; it\u2019s really hard to be open to being thrown away again\u2026.especially by people you think are friends.  So I delete the text and keep them as friends.", "As far as I know no one thinks the kid is mine.  I look just like my dad and this kid looks nothing like either of us.  If there was any indication that they didn\u2019t believe that, or if there was question, I would get dna; but everything, including the birth certificate and the divorce paperwork, are clear on that.  If they don\u2019t believe those (and they seem to believe them) why would anything else change their mind?  Being honest/clear about the kids genetics is one of the few things my ex did \u201cright\u201d.", "It\u2019s not being around my ex so much as knowing that my parents care more about her then me.  It\u2019s that they know them being involved in her life is an issue for me and doing it anyway.  F**k this is why I don\u2019t talk to my friends:  every time I do I feel like an AH.  It\u2019s trying to explain it that makes me wonder if my therapist was right and I should just apologize.", "Congrats on prioritizing yourself and your mental health. Sometimes it is really hard to distance yourself from toxic family so kudos to you. Now your therapist had one job only and that was to provide you with a safe space to talk about issues/problems and provide you with the tools to address them. They failed. You should file a complaint with their office and the Local and State Psychology Licensing Board.\n\nI wish you continued peace.", "OP, your therapist was terrible and not deserving of the title. Please don\u2019t let it sour your views on therapy in general. It can truly be life changing and I hope you give it another chance. You\u2019ll know you\u2019ve found the right one when you leave the appointment feeling better, not worse.", "> I\u2019m just not sure how to talk to a therapist (and probably how to talk to my friends) because it just hard for me to know what to say.\n\nthats the therapist's job, not urs", "I am a therapist (well psych mastered student but working already with patients) and I understand you. I get you. I understand the sentiment of hurt, of betrayal, of abandonment. The self estime taking a hit, you wondering if you are good enough and the self doubting. I promise you you can find help and begin to heal again. Sorry you met someone who didnt put you first but i promise it wont always be like this.\n\nI understand as well you coping through your work, but it isnt healthy in the long term. Putting aside your feelings of hurt and your struggles won't make them disappear, it's like putting a cover over a hole in a road. The hole is still there and you might still fall. Please consider this.\n\nGood luck to you.", "Way to go OP! I've also had to cut off abusive family, it SUCKS. Your therapist, boy would I like to put a boot up their behind! I'm sorry they were unable to be impartial, it happens. Please seek out a new therapist when you are ready, you still have a lot of unpacking to do. \n\nIt has taken me 2 years of constant therapy to really start to feel like a person again myself. You've got this OP!", "Start with \"Hi. Happy New Year.\" and if they respond, then you respond with \"I've had a rough year.\" Go from there. Start small, mention your family sucks, take it one message at a time. \n\nTry. Give them a chance to be your friend. I'm sure some of them miss you and want to be there for you.", "Start with Happy New Year.  How have you been?  You can explain you have been out of touch because of a bad year.  But then, and this is the trick, ask about them.  Show interest in their lives and that you are reaching out to find out how they are doing.  Don\u2019t share unless they ask and then just start with \u201cfamily drama\u201d \n\nRebuild the relationship based on your interest in their lives and shared interests you may have together.  The key is that friendship isn\u2019t all about you and your problems.  It\u2019s a two way street.\n\nMost people want to talk about themselves.  So break the ice by giving them a chance to do that.\n\nBut it sounds as if you are scared more than content at being lonely and that\u2019s not surprising given your history.  But anything worth having is worth risking for.\n\nGood luck and update again when you have tried.  This internet stranger is rooting for you.", "It seems as though you are isolating yourself, which isn\u2019t always a good thing.

If no, then why dodging questions and answers for one year?  Too much waste time.  \n\nMaybe your family trait (behind you) has something called \u201cseeing is believing\u201d. \n\nNow, whether it\u2019s your baby or not, you do know how your family behavior is.  Nothing change that.  Only YOU change your life. Treat them as strangers and you may continue LC like you do now.  \n\nI don\u2019t see why answers are not hurting.", "You should get a dna test just to get 100% proof", "I\u2019m not sure how to find that.  The thought of calling around and finding someone and dealing with waiting lists and people not taking new patients\u2026..I\u2019m just feel like it would be a waste to do that again.  It took months the last time.", "I guess it\u2019s easier to assume they actually still are my friends then to send a text and get no reply.  My family was never really family.  Are my friends actually friends?  I guess it\u2019s more Schr\u00f6dingers cat then an actual friendship and when it comes down to it I guess i suddenly realize I\u2019m clinging to the alive version of the cat because super position is easier then knowing.", "I have no doubt the kid is not mine.  Unless two very white people can have a kid that\u2019s clearly 1/2 African decent it should be clear I\u2019m not the father.  \n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m against doing it:  I just don\u2019t know how when the birth certificate and the divorce list the actual father and the kid looks like the birth father (including his dark skin) if they don\u2019t know the kids not mine:  dna won\u2019t change that.

He knows this is not his child, his ex knows it's not his child, his parents know it's not his child and obviously do not care (given that they've stepped up to be grandparents to the other children). Not to mention, why would his ex even allow this? He does not have any grounds to request a paternity test.", "Check to see if your company has an Employee Assistance Program.  They can help you find a therapist--or at least get you started on solid ground.  It's a benefit that doesn't report back to company, and you can usually find the information in your employee handbook or on the company benefits site.

If you're in the US, [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us) will let you look through profiles by local area and insurance they take. Reject anybody who has immediate availability, most good therapists have waiting lists, so somebody without one is a bit of a red flag. Calling is better than e-mailing in my experience, for whatever reason.\n\nOnce you get into see somebody, give them three sessions. Tell them you have no idea what you're doing and were burned by the last therapist, and explain what happened. See how they react to this, and whether it makes you feel comfortable. \n\nAt the end of 3 sessions, evaluate.\n\n1. Do you like them and feel they are trustworthy enough to open up a bit? If not, move on.\n2. Does the treatment plan \"make sense\"? It should be tailored to the things you've specifically mentioned. For example, if you say you're anxious about making friends, the plan should be about social anxiety.\n3. Look at some \"how to evaluate a therapist\" sites like [this](https://annveilleux.com/2013/09/08/evaluate-your-therapist/) or [this](https://psychcentral.com/lib/red-flags-a-clinician-isnt-right-for-you#red-flags)\n\nIt's a bit of work, some therapists are just bad and some therapists are good for some people but not for you. You can definitely do more research on this issue so you aren't going in blind.", "Its a process. Most people go through several therapists. The hippie answer is to find someone that resonates with you. Another way to say it is to find someone that actually helps you. Your previous therapist seemed to make things worse.\n\nYou can start by just googling \"psychologists\" or \"therapists\", or going through the directory on psychologytoday(dotcom). Make sure they are credentialed, and if possible choose a licensed psychologist over social worker or counselor. They have way more training, education, and in my experience are more helpful. It is not always the case, but if you want to do this going through the least amount of people possible, then aim for this.\n\nLast, pick up some reputable books on healthy and toxic relationships. Books go through rigorous editing processes, are usually well-referenced, and most importantly are subject to the entire profession's opinion, such that the best rise to the top. Get a couple, read them, and that is a good metric to go by.\n\nIts still not perfect, but these are a foundation to lay out your compass. It basically comes to how you want others to treat you, and what you do and do not want to be okay with. Not your parents, not your ex, not your friends, but you. That's where you start. When people start to tell you differently, examine it sure, do your research, but don't start there. Start with YOU.\n\nAlso, your parents are full of sh\\*t. Lets see your mom or siblings get knocked up by a 3rd party, and see if your dad or their partners turn the other cheek.", "Tell me where it says \u201cneed\u201d", "Is there a Synonyms for Dummies available?", "Oh lord you just showed your age.
