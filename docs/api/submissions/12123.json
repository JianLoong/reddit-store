Our parents aren't financially stable enough to care for her, and since our father is disabled and unable to take much of a role in caring for her at all, they decided it was best for her to live with me and my fianc\u00e9. She knows about this and has never asked to live with her actual parents or to spend more time with them.\n\nWe live far from my parents, and since A has school here she can't spend much time with them. She only gets to see them on breaks or occasionally on weekends. A doesn't have a very strong bond with our parents. She sees me and my fianc\u00e9 as her parents instead, which I have no issue with since we basically are. However, she's recently started calling us her mom and dad. I stopped bugging her about it, and my fianc\u00e9 has too, so she just calls us her parents now. (She's still perfectly aware that we aren't, she just prefers to call us mom and dad.)\n\nLast weekend we went to have dinner with our parents. A called me dad while telling a story, and my father was infuriated, and started yelling and asking A if he wasn't a good enough father for her, if she'd rather just be my kid instead, etc (My father has a horrible temper, and all throughout my childhood had a tendency to get angry over small things and have screaming fits during which he'll hit and throw things. It was one of the reasons we decided A would be best off living with me, but we were told he was better about it now). Normally I don't provoke him, but I refused to let A be yelled at like that, especially after I had to deal with it my whole childhood. I screamed that A had every right to see me as her father, after he had basically abandoned her with me. I had raised her and cared her since she was six, and he'd barely been present the entire time. He hadn't been a father to her for eight years, and I had been the one taking the role that entire time. Him and I ended up in a back-and-forth yelling argument. Keep in mind that A present the whole time. We got up and left without finishing our food.\n\nMy mom texted me the next day, saying that A needs to come and live with her \"real parents, because she's forgotten who conceived her and she needs some time with them to remember\". I responded that me and my fianc\u00e9 are more of parents for her than they've ever been, but I did ask A if she wanted to live with them. Unsurprisingly, she said no, and that was that.\n\nI've gotten texts from my mom every day since, not saying much that hadn't already been discussed. But for the last day she's been blowing up my phone telling me that A needs to remember her real parents, and saying its my fault for ever letting me believe that I'm anything near a father for her. My fianc\u00e9 says I'm in the right, and that my parents have no right to a daughter they chose not to raise. But I just don't know if I really am, and I want to make sure, since I want to know for a fact that I'm doing the right thing for A.

Don't let that girl waste time with her birth parents. It is only going to ruin things for her. Keep up your good work!", "NTA - No you most certainly are not the AH and frankly it doesn't sound like it would be safe for your sister to spend any more time with your parents, particularly your father. Your parents didn't raise your sister, you did. There may have been reasons for that, good ones even, but the fact is, you and your fiancee have been her parents, Your mother and father are delusional. They are the ones who have not been parents to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can only echo what others have said about speaking to a lawyer. At 14 your sister's wishes should be respected by a court BUT we've all seen how manipulative people can get in custody disputes, if you don't already have a formal legal custody agreement then its time to get one and if you do, then make sure there's no way they can overturn it.", "NTA but a little weird. It would make me uncomfortable but you do you.", "NTA. For all intents and purposes you are A's father. You took on that role because your parents were unable to care for her.

If they contribute nothing but angst to your lives, decrease contact with your mother and father. If A goes to them now, it would only be for punishment. If you can prove that you have been the custodial care taker for most of her life, you may be able to help her get emancipated from them, and you could adopt her.

As a teacher I really believe it doesn\u2019t matter who a child is raised by, as long as they are loved and cared for. Your parents are being selfish and are probably just ashamed of themselves.", "NTA. Sometimes it sucks to look in the mirror and see who you really are.  If you don\u2019t like what you see, you\u2019ve got no one to blame but yourself.  Parents are the people who put everything they\u2019ve got into raising you, who challenge themselves to be better for you, who know your presence makes their lives better and richer and more beautiful.

You are absolutely doing the right thing. \n\nI would suggest looking at whatever court documents I'm assuming you have about the living situation, just in case the AHs do decide to escalate the situation (and yes, the AHs are your parents). \n\nAnd this is all their doing: even if they are legitimately unable to care for A on a day-to-day basis and it's not easy for you to visit a lot, they are the adults in this situation and thus responsible for creating and nurturing any bond they want to have with A. The fact that they haven't done so and probably weren't planning on it, makes them huge AHs for blowing up about it. They should be thanking you endlessly for stepping up and becoming a good person and father to A, especially considering the examples they set in your childhood. \n\nGood for you!", "Back child support will most likely be ordered.

Clearly he cannot be around her. She\u2019s been safe from that for 8 years, there\u2019s no reason to thrust her back into that environment. She\u2019s likely in or entering high school, a critical time in anyone\u2019s life but with puberty and angry girls and sexist teachers, she\u2019s going to need you.", "NTA- she doesn't need to remember shit, it doesn't matter who conceived you, it matters who takes care of you and loves you. Your have been the only person taking care of her for basically her whole life. The only reason your mother wants A back is to prove a point. I suggest you get a lawyer, or at least have someone who will be able to have your back if your parents do some shitty messed up stunt.", "They do not want her back out of love. They want her back out of spite.  Contact a lawyer immediately and protect your loved one.  You are a good parent.", "op=NTA\n\nBut if you can you need to formalize this arrangement if not already done so.

Well done.", "NTA for sure!\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t abusive, but her brother was after she died. I wish I had had someone like you back then.", "It\u2019s understandable that he would be hurt, but not to react that way. It\u2019s also understandable for her to call you dad, you\u2019re essentially filling that role, and eliminates questions that other kids most certainly will have. No, NTA.", "NTA at all. You basically raised her yourself, hire A lawyer and protect yourself", "NTA. Protect her! Lawyer, court, document and save everything! Even from the school get EVERYTHING together. She needs to be with you legally and permanently", "This was my thought, too\u2014they\u2019re going to take A back and she\u2019ll be heartbroken, neglected, and abused. But I felt a little better once I realized that trying to get her back and then actually taking care of her is probably way more effort than these \u201cparents\u201d care to make. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason A calls OP and his fianc\u00e9 mom and dad. She knows they\u2019re not literally her parents, but they are the people who are raising her and caring for her every day. \n\nNTA", "I would assume they've given OP some sort of guardianship because otherwise how could he get her medical care or get her into school, but yes, they need something more permanently established, so they can't just retract that permission(or threaten to retract it on whim)."]}
