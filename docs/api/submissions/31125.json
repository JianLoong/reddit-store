Your brother just got out of prison and is adjusting to a new world. BUT he is projecting his toxic masculinity on his son.", "NTA\n\n\nYou brother needed to be brought down to earth again. His son is reading a genre he doesn't like and he the nerve to complain? To the person who took care of him for the last 5 years? Ignoring the top grades not appare t\u00f6y no problems otherwise? \n\n\n\nAt some point you just shut your mouth honestly.", "NTA, your brother sounds insecure and needs to grow out whatever macho bullshit is rotting his brain.", "Nta. You may have been a bit cold but nta. He needed a reality check. This is how many parents throw away all their hard work, love and everything they\u2019ve built up for their kids when they focus on a tiny aspect of their kids life which is not even bad like their sense of fashion, music or their hobbies. I had a friend who liked the gothic style but her mom ,who was a great mom up to that point, became obsessed with it and ended up ruining her relationship with her daughter,that tiny aspect of her daughter life was enough to bring up the worse of her and hurt her daughter in the most horrible ways. I\u2019ve always thought what if she just got over it her daughter was a goth so what she was lovely, smart, funny and a gentle soul just like she had taught her to be ,but no she fixated on something so dumb and stupid. Anyway help your brother to see what a wonderful person your nephew is and that his hobby has nothing to do with what kinda person he is, don\u2019t let him become like my friends mom that is just heartbreaking.", "NTA. Your brother proved how bad his judgement was. He failed his son, he couldn't be there for him because he got himself locked up. He can keep his mouth shut.", "NTA BUT I don\u2019t think he\u2019s necessarily a huge asshole either for feeling hurt (except if he said it to his son and tried to bully him but that wasn\u2019t clear.) \n\nSo he was being quite misogynistic by implying there was something wrong with being into things that are \u201cwomanly\u201d. Reading anything at all isn\u2019t gonna hurt anyone. Being able to be literate and follow a story and imagine another world helps the brain no matter what the story is about. It makes you think and ponder and put yourself in others shoes. \n\nAnd you hit a nerve because he is very glad his kid isn\u2019t and didn\u2019t do what he was doing. But he doesn\u2019t like being reminded of his past and wrongs just like anyone. And though his hurt is valid \u2026 Hopefully you made him think.", "NTA and your brother should appreciate more that you raised your nephew and not be so judgmental.", "NtA you took your nephew in. You ever right to throw in his face for the rest of his life what he did", "NTA.\n\nYou know what else romance novels do? They give a little insight into the female ideals of romance and sex...", "NTA\n\nYou were right on every point. And invoking a parent's past is absolutely appropriate when they are criticizing their kid.", "As a EFL teacher who teaches IELTS I just want to say an overall band score of 8 is awesome! \ud83d\udc4f Congratulations \ud83c\udf89", "Has your brother ever read those books? They\u2019re like soft core porn in pretty historical dresses! \ud83d\ude02 (and I do love those books)", "NTA also, he's pathetic. People, men, women, should read what ever the heck they want. If he feels weak in his manlyhood then that's his problem, not ohers'. And you're not less of a man if you have emotions or enjoy ready books of that category. You're also not more of a man because you do typical man stuff.", "NTA - I don\u2019t give a rats ass if he spent the last few years in prison; he ain\u2019t there anymore and he needs to not be such a toxic man.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
