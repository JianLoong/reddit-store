I took in my nephew(18) and he has been with me ever since he was only 13.\n\nWhen he was 16, my nephew took interest in romance so I bought him the Bridgerton novels. He's reread some of them several times over the past couple of years. Never told my brother about it though, since my brother was more interested in his sports activities, social life, if he's seeing anyone etc.\n\nAfter my brother's release, we began having dinner together at my place. My nephew is delighted to be able to have dinner with his dad again and to be able to fully hang out and do something as simple as watching TV together. Everything seemed to be going well.\n\nBut then my brother saw the aforementioned books. He recognized them since my late sister in law used to read them. He frowned and when my nephew went to the toilet, he asked me why I let my nephew read 'those girly books.' He said 'men shouldn't read them.'\n\nSo I said 'Why can't men read Romance? Reading those and other books helped him get an IELTS Overall band score of 8.0 That score and his literacy allowed him to get into one of the best law schools in our country. You should be proud of him.'\n\nHe still protested that there were many other better books for boys and men to read, so I said 'At least he is reading instead of doing what you used to when we were teens. You should be glad about that.'\n\nNow I might be an asshole for this comment because while he did cause some problems for our parents when we were teens, he also grew out of it quickly. He used to be a good role model to my nephew, up until the accepting bribes and now the 'men shouldn't read romance' thing. He looked really hurt at the reminder and said it was a cheap shot.\n\nUPDATE : I talked to him about it an hour ago after dinner. He admitted that he got used to putting up a tough guy facade from his time behind bars and that it\u2019s difficult to readjust. So I told him he still has time to work through this and sort the issue out. My brother promised he\u2019ll work on it, saying he\u2019ll see a therapist.", "created_utc": 1700193781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17x6igl/aita_for_telling_my_brother_you_should_be_glad/", "score": 1707, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had a friend who liked the gothic style but her mom ,who was a great mom up to that point, became obsessed with it and ended up ruining her relationship with her daughter,that tiny aspect of her daughter life was enough to bring up the worse of her and hurt her daughter in the most horrible ways. I\u2019ve always thought what if she just got over it her daughter was a goth so what she was lovely, smart, funny and a gentle soul just like she had taught her to be ,but no she fixated on something so dumb and stupid. Anyway help your brother to see what a wonderful person your nephew is and that his hobby has nothing to do with what kinda person he is, don\u2019t let him become like my friends mom that is just heartbreaking.", "NTA.
