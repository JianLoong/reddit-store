I took in my nephew(18) and he has been with me ever since he was only 13.\n\nWhen he was 16, my nephew took interest in romance so I bought him the Bridgerton novels. He's reread some of them several times over the past couple of years. Never told my brother about it though, since my brother was more interested in his sports activities, social life, if he's seeing anyone etc.\n\nAfter my brother's release, we began having dinner together at my place. My nephew is delighted to be able to have dinner with his dad again and to be able to fully hang out and do something as simple as watching TV together. Everything seemed to be going well.\n\nBut then my brother saw the aforementioned books. He recognized them since my late sister in law used to read them. He frowned and when my nephew went to the toilet, he asked me why I let my nephew read 'those girly books.' He said 'men shouldn't read them.'\n\nSo I said 'Why can't men read Romance? Reading those and other books helped him get an IELTS Overall band score of 8.0 That score and his literacy allowed him to get into one of the best law schools in our country. You should be proud of him.'\n\nHe still protested that there were many other better books for boys and men to read, so I said 'At least he is reading instead of doing what you used to when we were teens. You should be glad about that.'\n\nNow I might be an asshole for this comment because while he did cause some problems for our parents when we were teens, he also grew out of it quickly. He used to be a good role model to my nephew, up until the accepting bribes and now the 'men shouldn't read romance' thing. He looked really hurt at the reminder and said it was a cheap shot.\n\nUPDATE : I talked to him about it an hour ago after dinner. He admitted that he got used to putting up a tough guy facade from his time behind bars and that it\u2019s difficult to readjust. So I told him he still has time to work through this and sort the issue out. My brother promised he\u2019ll work on it, saying he\u2019ll see a therapist.", "created_utc": 1700193781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17x6igl/aita_for_telling_my_brother_you_should_be_glad/", "score": 531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother just got out of prison and is adjusting to a new world. BUT he is projecting his toxic masculinity on his son.", "NTA\n\n\nYou brother needed to be brought down to earth again. His son is reading a genre he doesn't like and he the nerve to complain? To the person who took care of him for the last 5 years? Ignoring the top grades not appare t\u00f6y no problems otherwise? \n\n\n\nAt some point you just shut your mouth honestly.", "NTA, your brother sounds insecure and needs to grow out whatever macho bullshit is rotting his brain.", "Nta. You may have been a bit cold but nta. He needed a reality check. This is how many parents throw away all their hard work, love and everything they\u2019ve built up for their kids when they focus on a tiny aspect of their kids life which is not even bad like their sense of fashion, music or their hobbies. I had a friend who liked the gothic style but her mom ,who was a great mom up to that point, became obsessed with it and ended up ruining her relationship with her daughter,that tiny aspect of her daughter life was enough to bring up the worse of her and hurt her daughter in the most horrible ways. I\u2019ve always thought what if she just got over it her daughter was a goth so what she was lovely, smart, funny and a gentle soul just like she had taught her to be ,but no she fixated on something so dumb and stupid. Anyway help your brother to see what a wonderful person your nephew is and that his hobby has nothing to do with what kinda person he is, don\u2019t let him become like my friends mom that is just heartbreaking.", "NTA. Your brother proved how bad his judgement was. He failed his son, he couldn't be there for him because he got himself locked up. He can keep his mouth shut.", "NTA BUT I don\u2019t think he\u2019s necessarily a huge asshole either for feeling hurt (except if he said it to his son and tried to bully him but that wasn\u2019t clear.) \n\nSo he was being quite misogynistic by implying there was something wrong with being into things that are \u201cwomanly\u201d. Reading anything at all isn\u2019t gonna hurt anyone. Being able to be literate and follow a story and imagine another world helps the brain no matter what the story is about. It makes you think and ponder and put yourself in others shoes. \n\nAnd you hit a nerve because he is very glad his kid isn\u2019t and didn\u2019t do what he was doing.
