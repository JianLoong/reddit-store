This morning, after slipping multiple times in the bike lanes, I decided to bike in the road. I was aggressively honked by drivers for this. I did my best to pull to the side, but there still wasn't enough space for them to pass me. There were two lanes, so I didn't completely stop the downtown traffic but I certainly slowed it down.\n\nFor reference, the street is a \"major arterial roadway\" and has a speed limit of 40 km/h (25 miles/h). While I would love to be able to drive to school/work, as a student in downtown Toronto, I have to settle for biking given that I'm living in one of the most expensive places on Earth. I sympathize with being frustrated by slow bikers on the roads but the way I see it, the real asshole is the city for not maintaining their bike infrastructure.

Cycling also wears down the pavement less, so it needs less maintenance.
