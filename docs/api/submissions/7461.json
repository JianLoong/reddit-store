It's 4 bedrooms and we rent it for 2k a month, which is pretty reasonable considering most of the comps for a place that size in that area go for $2500+ a month.\n\nMy aunt wanted me to rent to her daughter, who's a high school drop out, recovering addict, and bounces from one minimum wage job to the next more often than she changes socks. My aunt thought it was a great idea because my cousin could have the master bedroom, get her friends (cousin's friends, not aunt's) to rent out the other 3 rooms and split that with me and my husband. I said no for 3 primary reasons. 1. I don't trust my cousin to actually take care of the place. 2. If my cousin's friends are anything like her, I can't trust them either. 3. My aunt refused to offer more than $400 a month as she'd be the one paying the rent and bills for my cousin. Both are mad at me and saying I'm putting money and greed above helping out family in need. (Cousin has multiple evictions for absolutely trashing places she's lived in.)\n\nWe ended up renting to a lovely family with a newborn daughter. They've taken great care of the house so far and we're happy we chose them.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I inherited the house from my grandparents, cousin and I do not share that set of grandparents.

Mixing family and finances almost always spells trouble.", "NTA  there\u2019s a reason people say business and family don\u2019t mix.  You don\u2019t owe your aunt and cousin free housing, which is essentially what they\u2019re expecting by offering you less than 25% of the cost.  \n\nIf her daughter is such a good tenant, she should take her in.", "NTA, NTA, NTA and NTA.\n\nBruh, she just wants you to do charity for your cousin and when you refused she's mad? So entitled.", "NTA. Money and blood don\u2019t mix.", "NTA\n\nLet your aunt pay for her daughter to rent another place \u2026 or does she place greed above helping her daughter?", "NTA. You have no obligation to allow anyone unreliable to destroy your rental property.", "NTA\n\nwho needs enemies with family like this.", "NTA. Your aunt is the biggest asshole for enabling her asshole daughter.", "NTA. You did the right, responsible thing. That sounds like a sober living situation, and while sober living is a wonderful, noble arrangement, it's an arrangement for a landlord who's driven to that purpose. Not someone who simply wants to rent to a lovely, nuclear family.", "It\u2019s best not to mix business and family. These things can get ugly, and that\u2019s not even considering the fact that she\u2019s a recovering addict. NTA", "NTA. This is your house. You dont know who she will end up getting in as roommates. Once shes in, it sounds like there will be inexpicable delays in paying rent. \n\nBest not to rent to someone who is not stable.", "NTA. They're the ones being greedy and trying to take advantage of a kind family member. Why are they pushing so hard for your house? I would assume most likely so they can eventually come up with excuses as to why they can't pay rent each month.", "NTA. Mixing money and family like this is usually a bad idea, they're trying to take advantage of you because they know that nobody else would rent to her without a huge security deposit and evict her the first time they don't make rent.\n\nThey aren't even offering to rent the house from you, they're offering to rent 3 rental rooms for a split of the money.", "Hell no, you are NTA. This screams bad news from every possible angle. She doesn't want to pay fair rent, so you are expected to subsidize the cousin and her friends. If she didn't pay rent or trashed the place, imagine starting eviction proceedings against her. That would be an epic shit show. There is no way this could turn out good if you rented to her.", "NTA. Although your way of thinking is poor. Your cousin should not take additional stressful responsibilities by managing 3 other renters on your behalf but rather focus on herself and get back on track. That would have been enough as a line of reasoning to not proceed with the agreement. Anything else like \"she will trash the place\" etc. is fair concern but you have that risk with any renters.", "You know you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. Aunt can buy her own home to rent to her daughter and then pay for repairs when it gets trashed", "Even if your family had impeccable credentials, so to speak, it\u2019s almost never a good idea to mix business and family. So, just from the title alone I knew what my judgment was going to be.", "OP - you're very much wrong about something here, and it's important enough to ask you to correct it: \n\nYou say it wouldn't hurt you financially to rent to your cousin, but I think it's a safe bet that it would, in fact, hurt you financially. She has a history of trashing the rentals she's lived in? And a history of evictions? \n\nWhen she trashed your house, would she pay for repairs? That is, would her mother pay for them? And who would pay the costs of eviction? \n\nNTA.", "Nta\u2026. Never rent to friends or family rental properties are a business keep it as a business with leases and laws to protect you and the tennents \n\nFriends and family always end up owing rent doing damage that they never pay for", "NTA! Don\u2019t do this! I have had problems with renting to my niece (she is a lot older than I am but same generation) and it caused my whole family to fall apart. My niece told lies to everyone (she has had more run ins with the law than road runner with walls). I thought she had turned her life around but she didn\u2019t. I was glad this all happened before the actual renting because she would have crashed the house and I would have been the one picking up the pieces of what was left. She now still lives with her parents at almost 40. And my whole part of the family has gone NC with her part of the family. \n\nYou could tell your aunt you don\u2019t do business with family because you are affraid any problem might cause the family to fall apart. \n\nRent it to someone who is actually going to take care of your property.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she\u2019s mad she can\u2019t pawn her problem off on you.", "Nta, you made a wise decision", "NTA.
