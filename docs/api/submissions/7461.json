If you rented it to them not only would you be unlikely to see the $2k a month income, so you would be losing 2k (minus taxes and upkeep) but you'd also likely have heavier costs for damages and then increased insurance costs as a result.\n\nIf family are reliable then it's still almost a bad idea because one lost job, one bad month and now you have a legal fight between family rather than between your family and a third party.

They were always late with payments.  They didn't take care of the place.  They skipped half a month's rent at one point but since my husband collected the rent each month, I'm pretty sure it wasn't a one-time thing.  We were screwed out of a lot of money because of them.  \n\nFor the first year they refused to even vacuum the carpet.  It was brown carpet but there were obvious \"walking trails\" that were a much darker brown.  They only mowed once every few months because they \"just couldn't borrow a mower more frequently.\"  We offered to buy them a nice mower but they refused because they only wanted to use the exact model that they borrowed from their friend but they couldn't remember what model it was.  They, of course, refused to call the friend to get the info.  **They wanted us to sink over $15k into fixing up the backyard to their tastes and they were then going to charge us to take care of the backyard**.  They decided $15 per hour for labor plus reimbursement for weed killer, etc. was being generous.  (They made it obvious they were going to find a way to zero out the rent or even make us pay for them to stay there.)  \n\nWe'd go over once every few weeks to visit, take them out for lunch/dinner and occasionally buy them stuff.  (We visited them like that long before we stupidly rented to them.)  They invited us over for a holiday meal (they had us do the grocery shopping so we paid for the majority of the food) then refused to talk to us most of the night.  A few days later they called and went off on us, \"How would you like it if your mortgage company kept checking up on you like that?\"  Well, if the mortgage company insisted on taking me out for good food once or twice a month, let me pay late every single month without penalty, gave me gifts, occasionally bought me groceries and charged me only half what the place was worth, I'd find a way to \"suffer\" through it.\n\nWe finally told them this wasn't working out and we were going to put the house on the market.  To be nice, we gave them multiple months warning and waited until well after the best selling time of the year so it was convenient for them to move.  We didn't charge them the last month's rent so they could afford a security deposit elsewhere.  We paid a lot of money to fix the place back up so it was sellable.  \n\nThey've refused to talk to us ever since then.  We were lambasted by some of the family for being so mean to them and told we needed to make it up to them.  Yeah, F That.", "Hahahahaha.

So that would be a financial hit.  You are responsible for taxes, insurance and repairs.  Plus I presume you have a purposes for the \"net\" rent money, even if it's saving.  \n\nThen there's the possible drug use.  If drugs are used in your home, police can actually seize the home, which would mean you could lose it.  \n\nThen there is the possible/likely damage--you have no reason to believe that she and 3(yeah sure they'll stick to that) roommates.  I can see each room getting a roommate and a bf/gf--so easily 8 people \"living\" there with half not paying rent--or at least they'd split it by 8 to make it $200-250 each.  There is no real likelihood that they'll all pay regularly.\n\nGetting ONE family with a \"guaranteed\" income(credit check, rental history/recommendation) makes more sense than 4-8 random people wearing out carpets, staining furniture, etc.  \n\nWould you want to see your grandparents house treated with disrespect?
