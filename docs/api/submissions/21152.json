About 4 to 5 months ago, my long-time gaming friend, whom I've known for almost 10 years, asked me if I would like to go on vacation with him since he hadn't been on vacation for a long time. His family owns a small house in Croatia, and we planned to chill at the beach, watch some series, and go to parties.\n\nWe intended to split the costs for cleaning, food, and transportation. He lives in northern Germany, and I live in Austria. The plan was for him to drive to my place by car (about 700 km), and then the next day, we would drive the remaining 300 kilometers to Croatia together.\n\nNow, he called me today and asked if it would be okay for his girlfriend to come along. I have nothing against his girlfriend, but I'm afraid of being unnecessary there and essentially being the fifth wheel. So, I offered him the option that she could drive instead of me, and I would stay at home, but he doesn't want that.

He wants you to drive the both of them there, and then you'll have to hang with a couple the whole trip...ick. just politely yell him you're no longer available. He changed the vibe of the vacation without your ok. You're within your right to decline.", "NTA. He\u2019s changing the whole dynamic of the trip and third wheeling you.", "Don't let him guilt you into going on a trip: if YOU want to go to Croatia, create an itinerary for yourself with some time to spend with your friend.

It sounds like him and his gf can't afford to go by themselves and if he brings her, the costs of the trip have increased by at least her food. \n\nI'd ask him if gf will be paying for 1/3 of the trip. I'd still cancel, personally. NTA", "NAH\n\nI would still go. It\u2019ll prob be a good time. You could always tell him in advance that you do not want to feel like a third wheel", "It sounds like he wants you to come and doesnt think of you as a third or fifth wheel, I'd just do it, im sure you'll still have a good time.\nMaybe just mention you are feeling like that and hopefully he will ease your concern", "NTA to say to him that you signed up for a vacation just with him; so the two options for you are that you go together, on your own, as planned, or he goes with his gf and you stay home. \n\nI wonder whether the pressure is in fact coming from his gf, not him? Maybe he'd be quite relieved if you held your ground and insisted on it just being the two of you?", "NTA. This isn't the trip you originally agreed to.", "NTA it sounds like they can't afford the trip without you and you're better off not going  or else you'd end up paying more then you want and being mad. otherwise tell him you'll go only if the gf doesn't cuz it isn't fair to plan a trip one way and then try to do it completely different unless someone was trying to go for free", "I would not go under the current setup of you paying half. Add an additional person, lowers the cost for everyone.  A 50/25/25 split isn\u2019t equitable.  That\u2019s part one of the discussion. Part two is the potential for you to feel like odd man out.  It could still be a fun trip, but you need to make it clear you are not going to subsidize the GF going. But it sounds like she wants to piggyback on your dime and that\u2019s not ok. \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure your friend goes on a vacation.", "NAH.

You would be a third wheel and possibly feel left out of everthing.  I would be hesitant to go as well for that reason.  FYI I love Austria.  Lived in Saltzburg for a summer.  Amazing city.", "NTA. Your concerns are valid and many in that same type of situation share the same concerns. I'd suggest you go. The trip will be fun and you'll most likely enjoy it a lot more than you think.", "INFO: I'm confused. Did your friend say that it's all three of you together or no vacation? Or did he say that he wants you there, whether his girlfriend goes or not?\n\nI am a bit concerned that he won't go on vacation unless you go. Either he wants to go with you first and foremost, or he plans to use you to subsidize his girlfriend's costs (continue to split costs in half instead of three ways).", "I agree, but I would say NAH rather than NTA", "Yeah, I find that bit weird. I am also wondering how costs would be split. It is also possible that the friend really wants to go with OP and would be fine if the girlfriend stayed behind. It doesn't seem like OP left that as an option though.", "Almost correct. The options would be girlfriend doesn't go or OP doesn't go. The friend saying he and the girlfriend won't go without OP is telling. Maybe OP is the friend's first priority.", "Your concerns are valid.\n\nThe question is are you good with going off by yourself(esp. since it's your car).  finding a spot on the beach by yourself etc.\n\nIt might be all good--do you have interactions with friend and his GF --ie going out to dinner where it's all good the three of you?  If you do well locally as a \"Three\" person gig then it should be okay.  \n\nBut if you have evidence that you WOULD be made to feel like a 3rd wheel and you don't feel comfortable being by yourself in a foreign country(are there language barrier issues?) then I could see why you don't want to go.\n\nAlso you don't address the financial issues--would you still be paying half or would you now be paying 1/3rd.  He may have invited you ONLY to get you to pay half/lion share here.  \n\nI think you need to answer these questions before you make your decision on whether or not to continue forward.  Also how much lead time is he giving you.  a week? a month? a day?", "We planed the trip just for us 2. He also said he would not go anymore if his gf could not go with us.", "Hey thank you for this comment :)\n\nWe would drive in his car because i don't have a driving license. He wants me to still pay 50/50 but its only 350\u20ac so i don't think he uses me to cut expenses. Also i only speak German, my school English and a bit Italian but no Croatian or anything else. Last of all we planed to stay for 2 weeks.", "He want 50/50 still but its not that much as we only have to pay cleaning, power and water so it will be about 350 for me if we pay 50/50. Also he said he would not go if he had to leave his gf behind :/", "that\u2019s his problem. nta."]}
