We had been his foster parents for three years and we wanted to make it official.  \n\nHe met his wife when he was 18.  She knew he was adopted and she thought it would be good for him to get to know his biological parents.  \n\nOver the course of the next few years my ex wife and I were slowly pushed out of his life.  \n\nWhen they got married we only recieved a wedding invitation.  We were not part of the wedding party.  His biological parents and their spouses sat at the family table.  \n\nWe have not had the opportunity to meet our granddaughter and she is nearly three years old now.  \n\nI am sad about the situation but my ex wife is heartbroken.  I hate to see her hurt when all she did was try and be a good mom.  I can honestly say that I am not a fan of my daughter-in-law and I wish she had never come into our lives.  \n\nRecently they have run into financial problems and they lost their home. My son's job is in the city we live in and his biological parents and his in-laws all live in other cities.  He called my ex wife to ask if they could stay with us while they got back on their feet.  \n\nI said no.  My ex wife wants to but I refuse to be used.  He has been distancing himself from us for nine years now.  The only reason he called was because he is desperate.  I don't think I owe him anything.  I offered to pay for whatever it costs for him to move his family to the cities where his real family is.  \n\nHis wife called me to scream at me.  She says that I am abandoning my son and grandchild.  I said that since he didn't think of us as parents when they got married and had a child then they should not think of is that way now.  Then I blocked her.  \n\nMy ex wife says that I'm being too harsh and that I need to forgive them.  But here's the thing.  I don't think it will change anything.  All that will happen is that they live in our home and then they abandon my wife again as soon as the chance presents itself.\n\n#EDIT\n\nHe was removed from his biological parents because they were very young and it wasn't a good situation.  If they had been older or more stable at m sure they would not have severed their parental rights.\n\n#EDIT \n\nSorry I edited my post to make it more clear.  His mom and I are divorced.  She is in an extended care facility and he cannot live there.  I kept our home.  I am still friends with her and we see the kids together as a family.  I still care for her deeply but her condition wasn't something she wanted me to deal with.

I understand your wife wanting to bring him back but sounds like he has no remorse over how he has treated yall for almost a decade.", "This really is a sad situation OP.  It appears from your son\u2019s perspective, largely due to his wife\u2019s influence, that you and your wife were just his caretaker until he was reunited with his \u2018real parents\u2019.  You and your wife did a wonderful thing raising this person, but  he\u2019s shown you his true feelings for you two.  Stay the course because in my opinion you are being used as a stop gap measure.

You raised him, he didn\u2019t just fade away. Feels like there are \u201cmissing reasons\u201d here.", "Ehhhhh I'm on the fence with this. Is it not possible or likely he has had trauma associated with being removed from his bio parents and placed into foster care that he was never given the opportunity to work through and by 18 he was very confused and felt like he didn't fit in or belong in your family and quickly getting married so young kind of seems to me like he could have really benefited from therapy as a child into adulthood. Why were you against him finding his bio parents? Does he not have a right to know where he came from and why he was in foster care and later adopted? It just screams trauma to me as I am also a child of trauma with a disrupted home situation. \n\nI can understand your hurt and pain by this situation but I really feel like you should give him the chance to answer these questions and see if there was something you did that made him act out in this way.

It's not an act of charity to adopt, we aren't in victorian times taking poor urchins off the street. OP chose to be a parent and raising a child is a responsibility that he was obligated to fulfil after making that choice. \n\nI'm not saying its what you mean, but an extension of that which comes up all the time on reddit is adopted children somehow owing their parents for raising them in a way biological children do not. That adoptive parents are entitled to love and loyalty forever and anything less is ungrateful and malicious. \n\nNo-one owes their parents for raising them, bio, step, adopted, foster or otherwise.\n\nEdit: I see we are starting with accusing me of saying things I didn't say.\n\nI didn't say the son going NC wasn't bad. \n\nI'm saying if the reason people find it bad, or worse than it would have been, **because he was adopted**, then thats BS and you should evaluate why you hold adopted people to different standards.\n\nEdit 2: You can spit vitriol at me and downvote all you want;\n\n**No-one owes their parents for raising them, bio, step, adopted, foster or otherwise.**\n\nThere are infinite reasons a child might end up NC with their parents.

So your fine with OP son going NC with the only real parents he every had and replacing them with the bio parents?\n\nBy no means does OP son own him and his ex wife anything but you can\u2019t honestly believe abandoning the people who took care of you and raised you as their own is acceptable?", "I think the difference is that the adopted kid ditched them for a perceived \"better\" option of the bio parents.  Bio kids don't have that option, so there's no apples-to- apples comparison possible. \n\nIt's not like the kid followed the wrong path and lost a decade to drugs or a cult or whatever. He actively chose to dump his adoptive parents. I've never been in the situation, but I imagine it'd be like an ex-spouse coming back after their affair partner dumps them. Thanks but no thanks. \n\nThe only reason I'm not a full- fledged n ta is because the kid was 18 when this happened. Teenagers make questionable decisions at the best of times and it's possible he was just too embarrassed to come back and say \"I screwed up, can we rebuild\".

Did you express your hurt when you were only a guest at their wedding?", "This reply kind of makes me feel you treated him as a different race than you. The only reason you can think of is the same race? Not anything else? I'm sorry I don't quite believe that. His behaviors are screaming trauma without help now maybe that trauma came from when he was placed into foster care and just never got dealt with or maybe it came from your time with him but I highly doubt it's only because of race.", "Are you sure she doesn't understand that?\n\nWhat if she knows that but doesn't care?", "All my adult children live with me and 2 out of 3 only live here because they have no choice.  And the reason I let them is because they have no choice lol.  I know it isn't the same scenario and I don't doubt their love for me but even in your scenario my kids would always have my home to return to.  I know it is hard to understand but they just would.

Just because you provided him with a home does not mean he was able to automatically heal from that trauma.

That is an especially damaging dynamic in adoption and causes a lot of dysfunction in families. The child had no say in their circumstances and you made all the decisions for them, so you can't come back later and demand that they be grateful to you.

That trauma can manifest well into adulthood, sometimes in ways that are hard for the adoptee to understand.\n\n- As an adopted child, is natural to want to reach out and connect with your biological family.  Actually doing it is......so much more emotionally complex than I can begin to describe.  If the son has had a positive experience doing this to the point where he wants to build a relationship with them, he may be making up for lost time by putting more effort into relationships that, at some point in his life, he did not expect to have.  \n\n- Every family is different, no adoption experience is the same BUT I will say this: how adopted parents react to an adopted child making contact with their biological parents is crucial.  That is vital information that we are missing here.  My adopted parents, for example, reacted horribly to me making contact despite me being a 20yo woman at the time.  It was a positive experience for me, but even 7 years later it has yet to be a healing one because of the unnecessary strain this has had on my relationship with my adopted parents and the open jealousy/resentment they show for my biological family. The parents in this scenario may have handled it with perfect support or they may have handled it terribly - it's difficult to judge without honest context. \n\nOP, if you have been a supportive adoptive parent throughout your son's decision to contact his family - I'm sorry for the distance that happened between you.  Being adopted can come with emotions that are hard to pin down....maybe try to settle the dust a bit by reaching out with a gentle, humble manner and asking to understand more about how your son feels about being adopted?  If he's willing to share, maybe there are some important feelings buried deep down that he wants to share but doesn't know how.  Support doesn't have to be financial.  If you don't feel comfortable with that, it's okay, perhaps you can open a door for emotional support instead.\n\nTLDR;  Adoption is incredibly nuanced.  Reconnecting with your biological family is even more nuanced.  Without knowing more about how the reunion was received by the adopted parents, it's difficult to accurately judge the behavior of either OP or his son.", "NTA", "NTA, actually the opposite (what would that be?)  \n\nThis has to be painful for you, but allowing children to experience the consequences of their choices is the best parenting. \n\nBy offering to pay for them to move near the family they chose, you demonstrate you are neither abandoning nor being vengeful for their rejecting you. \n\nRather, you are acknowledging and respecting their choices. Even when that is difficult or inconvenient, being treated as if you made choices intentionally is part of growing up. Dealing with the consequences of your choices is how we learn. \n\nConsider: Is this a child who wants to improve a relationship with you, or mend fences, or be part of your life going forward?

You seem to have forgotten how being adopted, to be abandoned by your birth parents can be deeply traumatising and wounding for the child. You loving him doesn\u2019t make that go away. If you stand back and look at this more objectively you might understand that his actions were his attempt to heal rather than about you. And now you\u2019re abandoning him when he\u2019s in need.\n\nYou really should have done much more to prepare yourself for this stage of adoption. You\u2019ve handled it very badly and should have done better. When you sign up to adopt a child it shouldn\u2019t be about fulfilling your need for a child it should be about providing them with a living home and helping them with their trauma.

His wife has made it clear that she has neither respect nor affection for you.\n\nNow that they are in dire straits, they aren't reaching out to the bio parents whom he decided were more his parents than the people who raised them.

Also interesting in how your ex wife thinks you are incapable of caring for any imperfect being in your life as she saw her condition as something that would be a hindrance to your happiness.

As someone that is adopted you're speaking from ignorance and you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Don't paint adoptees with such a broad brush. Not all of us are like this.\n\n3.

You bloody take the money and you are happy you do not have to look at them 24/7.", "Yes, but they didn\u2019t even try that. DIL called and yelled at them. How entitled!", "A lot of parents who have their kids taken away never accept that it was their own fault. It's possible they have written a narrative in their own minds where whatever they were doing wasn't really that bad, and they were discriminated against because they were young, and the evil state stole their child. They might see OP and his ex as complicit in that since they were originally his foster carers and might have been looking after him before the bioparents' rights were finally terminated.", "How would we know they weren't?

Unless the DIL has literally been keeping him locked up then this is not 100% her fault. Even if his wife pressured him, it's ultimately the son's responsibility to maintain his own family relationships.\n\nAs it is, we don't even really know that the wife is the one pushing it. OP says she encouraged him to meet his biological parents, not that she told him to cut his adoptive parents out. He could have been planning to do this all along and it's just a coincidence that he met his wife at the same time he became a legal adult with the right to make these decisions.", "You do realize it was ultimately the son's decision to contact his biological family, right?  It's possible that the DIL just happened to be the first person he felt comfortable expressing that desire to, or the first person who actually supported his decision to do so.\n\nMost adopted children wonder about their biological families for their entire lives and I highly doubt that the first time the son thought about it was at 18 years of age.

It's probably something he would have eventually wanted to do anyway, it's normal to be curious about where you came from, especially when he wasn't adopted at birth. \n\nContacting the bioparents is not the problem. You can meet your bioparents and even have a great relationship with them without rejecting the parents who raised you.", "What does him being an adult have to with anything? Yes, he's over 18. He's an adult. Happy? He fits the definition of \"everyone older than 17 is an adult\".\n\nDo you REALLY, actually think that adults are not influenced by anyone in any way? That they are some weird androids?\n\nShe came to him. Told him to find his bio parents. He listened to her and did what she told him. Therefore she is to blame.
