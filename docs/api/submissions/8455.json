We had been his foster parents for three years and we wanted to make it official.  \n\nHe met his wife when he was 18.  She knew he was adopted and she thought it would be good for him to get to know his biological parents.  \n\nOver the course of the next few years my ex wife and I were slowly pushed out of his life.  \n\nWhen they got married we only recieved a wedding invitation.  We were not part of the wedding party.  His biological parents and their spouses sat at the family table.  \n\nWe have not had the opportunity to meet our granddaughter and she is nearly three years old now.  \n\nI am sad about the situation but my ex wife is heartbroken.  I hate to see her hurt when all she did was try and be a good mom.  I can honestly say that I am not a fan of my daughter-in-law and I wish she had never come into our lives.  \n\nRecently they have run into financial problems and they lost their home. My son's job is in the city we live in and his biological parents and his in-laws all live in other cities.  He called my ex wife to ask if they could stay with us while they got back on their feet.  \n\nI said no.  My ex wife wants to but I refuse to be used.  He has been distancing himself from us for nine years now.  The only reason he called was because he is desperate.  I don't think I owe him anything.  I offered to pay for whatever it costs for him to move his family to the cities where his real family is.  \n\nHis wife called me to scream at me.  She says that I am abandoning my son and grandchild.  I said that since he didn't think of us as parents when they got married and had a child then they should not think of is that way now.  Then I blocked her.  \n\nMy ex wife says that I'm being too harsh and that I need to forgive them.  But here's the thing.  I don't think it will change anything.  All that will happen is that they live in our home and then they abandon my wife again as soon as the chance presents itself.\n\n#EDIT\n\nHe was removed from his biological parents because they were very young and it wasn't a good situation.  If they had been older or more stable at m sure they would not have severed their parental rights.\n\n#EDIT \n\nSorry I edited my post to make it more clear.  His mom and I are divorced.  She is in an extended care facility and he cannot live there.  I kept our home.  I am still friends with her and we see the kids together as a family.  I still care for her deeply but her condition wasn't something she wanted me to deal with.

I understand your wife wanting to bring him back but sounds like he has no remorse over how he has treated yall for almost a decade.", "This really is a sad situation OP.  It appears from your son\u2019s perspective, largely due to his wife\u2019s influence, that you and your wife were just his caretaker until he was reunited with his \u2018real parents\u2019.  You and your wife did a wonderful thing raising this person, but  he\u2019s shown you his true feelings for you two.  Stay the course because in my opinion you are being used as a stop gap measure.

It would be devastating to have an child, they push you out and you never get to meet your granddaughter.

I would still say BUT if you two talk this over and she's still ok to roll the dice to consider it. I'd make it conditional on family therapy though, and jeeeeeez if there was any way to keep as much distance between you and the wife...do that.

You raised him, he didn\u2019t just fade away. Feels like there are \u201cmissing reasons\u201d here.", "Ehhhhh I'm on the fence with this. Is it not possible or likely he has had trauma associated with being removed from his bio parents and placed into foster care that he was never given the opportunity to work through and by 18 he was very confused and felt like he didn't fit in or belong in your family and quickly getting married so young kind of seems to me like he could have really benefited from therapy as a child into adulthood. Why were you against him finding his bio parents? Does he not have a right to know where he came from and why he was in foster care and later adopted? It just screams trauma to me as I am also a child of trauma with a disrupted home situation. \n\nI can understand your hurt and pain by this situation but I really feel like you should give him the chance to answer these questions and see if there was something you did that made him act out in this way.

It's not an act of charity to adopt, we aren't in victorian times taking poor urchins off the street. OP chose to be a parent and raising a child is a responsibility that he was obligated to fulfil after making that choice. \n\nI'm not saying its what you mean, but an extension of that which comes up all the time on reddit is adopted children somehow owing their parents for raising them in a way biological children do not. That adoptive parents are entitled to love and loyalty forever and anything less is ungrateful and malicious. \n\nNo-one owes their parents for raising them, bio, step, adopted, foster or otherwise.\n\nEdit: I see we are starting with accusing me of saying things I didn't say.\n\nI didn't say the son going NC wasn't bad. \n\nI'm saying if the reason people find it bad, or worse than it would have been, **because he was adopted**, then thats BS and you should evaluate why you hold adopted people to different standards.\n\nEdit 2: You can spit vitriol at me and downvote all you want;\n\n**No-one owes their parents for raising them, bio, step, adopted, foster or otherwise.**\n\nThere are infinite reasons a child might end up NC with their parents.

So your fine with OP son going NC with the only real parents he every had and replacing them with the bio parents?\n\nBy no means does OP son own him and his ex wife anything but you can\u2019t honestly believe abandoning the people who took care of you and raised you as their own is acceptable?", "I think the difference is that the adopted kid ditched them for a perceived \"better\" option of the bio parents.  Bio kids don't have that option, so there's no apples-to- apples comparison possible. \n\nIt's not like the kid followed the wrong path and lost a decade to drugs or a cult or whatever. He actively chose to dump his adoptive parents. I've never been in the situation, but I imagine it'd be like an ex-spouse coming back after their affair partner dumps them. Thanks but no thanks. \n\nThe only reason I'm not a full- fledged n ta is because the kid was 18 when this happened.

Did you express your hurt when you were only a guest at their wedding?", "This reply kind of makes me feel you treated him as a different race than you. The only reason you can think of is the same race? Not anything else? I'm sorry I don't quite believe that. His behaviors are screaming trauma without help now maybe that trauma came from when he was placed into foster care and just never got dealt with or maybe it came from your time with him but I highly doubt it's only because of race.", "Are you sure she doesn't understand that?\n\nWhat if she knows that but doesn't care?", "All my adult children live with me and 2 out of 3 only live here because they have no choice.  And the reason I let them is because they have no choice lol.  I know it isn't the same scenario and I don't doubt their love for me but even in your scenario my kids would always have my home to return to.  I know it is hard to understand but they just would.

In any event, I have learned that it is not a good idea to burn your bridges. I was in a similar situation of not being able to see my grandchild for a year. JUst letting them move in with you is not a good idea unless you meet and discuss why they distanced you and how it made you feel, and also that you listened to their POV. If there is no meeting of the minds, then they need to find another place to live.

Even though they messed up, I\u2019d give anything to have a happy biological family. But trying to repair things with them would mean distancing myself from people I love, and owe so much to.

Op asked his son why he distanced but never got a real answer. OP could only come up with that maybe it\u2019s because they are the same race (son, wife and bio parents). I feel like the wife may of had something to do with it. My opinion as to why OP wouldn\u2019t be excited is; if someone you cared for for 15 years decided to leave you without giving a reason and then only comes back when they need to use you, would you be excited?

They said that parents who adopt a child are not automatically either good people or good parents, and thus they are not owed anything by the child they adopted.

Family friends I knew very well. They adored both adoptive children, were the most amazing people and it is inconceivable to me that there was any abuse or harm. One child was a different race. They made significant efforts to help him be connected to his racial identity but it seems like it wasn\u2019t enough. He found his real father as an adult and prioritised that connection to an extent that was very painful for his adoptive parents. They never turned him away though and he did intermittently rely heavily on them for financial and practical support. Then he would reject them again because he felt he belonged with his father even though his father was not a great guy to say the least. It was a really sad situation.
