My 30th birthday is coming up on the 20th of May. \n\nMy ex texted me tonight and asked if he can take my son to FL with his GF for my sons Bday (which is in august btw) may 18-21. I reminded him that that\u2019s actually MY birthday weekend so we are picking him up early on the 19th to have him for my real birthday on the 20th. All of which is shown on our parenting schedule that we both have. He then asks if he can have the next weekend instead. I sent him a screenshot of our parenting schedule and said no that we have him for Memorial Day as well. I ask if there\u2019s really no other weekend in the entirety of the summer he can take him. He responds a little while later saying his  GF has already booked a condo starting on the 18th and they\u2019d loose that money and the only other weekend for the summer they could make work is in July but is double the price.\nHe acknowledges that he fucked op because he has all the same access to our parenting schedule as I do (not mentioning the fact that we were married for 7 years and have only been divorced for 3 so I feel like my birthday should still be a little bit of a memorized date but whatever). He offers to trade me his birthday and another holiday to make up for it.\nBut I REALLY want to say no because I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice time with my son on my birthday because he can\u2019t get his shit together and look at a calendar! We coparent great together and have minimal issues but this is really getting under my skin.\n\nTLDR: my ex wants to take my son out of state during my birthday weekend and is trying to guilt me into saying yes even though he\u2019s the one that fucked up.", "created_utc": 1683166496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1376yd3/aita_for_wanting_my_son_for_my_bday_wknd/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With regard to allowing your son to make this decision for himself, he's very much in the position my sons found themselves on occasion. If he stays with you to celebrate your birthday, he may very well feel he's lost out on a great trip with his dad. But if he goes with his dad, he may spend your birthday weekend feeling guilty for having fun that doesn't include you, knowing in his 11 year old mind that he 'chose his dad and the trip' over spending your birthday with you. As I said, my sons were confronted with this numerous times because my ex is a bit of an ass. I had to really fake the whole 'Go and have fun with your dad! Enjoy every minute of your trip! We'll celebrate XYZ when you get back.' with big smiles, so that they didn't feel any guilt or worry that I would feel sidelined. \nYou're NTA, OP. All I ever really want for birthdays, Mother's Days, Christmas, etc. is to see my kids, to celebrate with them. I understand. I also understand that sometimes we have to act our way out of them feeling guilty for being kids, and wanting to go and have fun. Wishing you all the best.", "Nta it sounds like his gf intentionally planned it on your bday", "NTA", "Why not just ask your son what he would prefer? He is the priority afterall", "NTA. So she booked a condo? They can still go without your son. It's your birthday, of course you'd want that time with your son. It's already booked in your calendar that he's scheduled to be with you anyway. It's not your fault they didn't plan this better.", "NTA  I don't like the sound of this at all.", "Could he have confused his son's birthdate with his ex-wife's? It's crazy if he forgot what time of year his kid was born but honestly I have read worse on here.", "He's not even out money. He and the gf can still go - which I suspect was gf's plan the whole time. \n\nNTA", "Right! Someone Said do what\u2019s best for the child. What\u2019s best was creating the schedule (following it) and making sure he has access to both parents. Going to Florida is a trip that can be done at any time. It doesn\u2019t contribute to the \u201cgood\u201d of anyone.", "There\u2019s absolutely a way to let a child have an input in the decision without it being about choosing one parent over another. \n\nFor example \u201chey, you have an opportunity to go to Florida for a weekend with Dad. It sounds really cool.  Would you rather be here for my birthday celebrations weekend or Memorial Day weekend?  We have a family party on X day but going to the park on Y day.  Don\u2019t worry about my birthday, you and I can have a special celebration together whichever weekend you chose.\u201d\n\nCasual, not emotionally loaded. Practical. An 11 year old would have no problems with going \u201cI\u2019d rather be here for X and miss Y\u201d and you go \u201cno problem, I\u2019ll fix the dates with dad then\u201d.\n\nWhen we didn\u2019t include my daughter in these kinds of discussions is when she got upset. The key to coparenting is to make it open, factual and not over-emotionalise everything.", "I suspect the narcissistic one is actually the new GF... just a hunch.\n\n\nNTA OP stand strong.", "And why isn't half of maintaining that relationship on dad? Why is it only on OP?", "Yep this.  I\u2019ve coparented with my ex husband for the last 8 years (daughter was 11 and is now 18). My ex was no my malicious or manipulative at all but pretty useless with dates and booking stuff.  No way would I want to let my daughter miss out on something cool so I could be right. \n\nOP should explain to her son what\u2019s happened on her birthday weekend and on Memorial Day weekend and ask him which he\u2019d like to stay for and which one to go to Florida for (whilst reassuring him that they can celebrate her birthday whichever weekend he picks to stay).\n\nIf OP stays firm to the schedule then it will bite her in the ass one day when she needs her ex to be flexible about something for her.", "Sounds like a powerplay on the GF's part.", "He can't it would cost more.", "omg why are dads like this\n\nmine knew that we were all even numbered ages in the same year and had to use that to try to guesstimate how old we were all the time \ud83d\ude29"]}
