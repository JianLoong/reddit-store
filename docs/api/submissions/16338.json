My 30th birthday is coming up on the 20th of May. \n\nMy ex texted me tonight and asked if he can take my son to FL with his GF for my sons Bday (which is in august btw) may 18-21. I reminded him that that\u2019s actually MY birthday weekend so we are picking him up early on the 19th to have him for my real birthday on the 20th. All of which is shown on our parenting schedule that we both have. He then asks if he can have the next weekend instead. I sent him a screenshot of our parenting schedule and said no that we have him for Memorial Day as well. I ask if there\u2019s really no other weekend in the entirety of the summer he can take him. He responds a little while later saying his  GF has already booked a condo starting on the 18th and they\u2019d loose that money and the only other weekend for the summer they could make work is in July but is double the price.\nHe acknowledges that he fucked op because he has all the same access to our parenting schedule as I do (not mentioning the fact that we were married for 7 years and have only been divorced for 3 so I feel like my birthday should still be a little bit of a memorized date but whatever). He offers to trade me his birthday and another holiday to make up for it.\nBut I REALLY want to say no because I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice time with my son on my birthday because he can\u2019t get his shit together and look at a calendar! We coparent great together and have minimal issues but this is really getting under my skin.\n\nTLDR: my ex wants to take my son out of state during my birthday weekend and is trying to guilt me into saying yes even though he\u2019s the one that fucked up.", "created_utc": 1683166496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1376yd3/aita_for_wanting_my_son_for_my_bday_wknd/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is. His lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on your part, he should have made sure all his dates were correct. No one is dying, no one is in danger, he is only out money. He will live. Don't give in, because that shows him he's going to be able to get you to do whatever he wants. The schedule was made, he agreed to it. It is not your problem if he cannot commit to it.", "NTA. Your son\u2019s birthday is in August but he\u2019s celebrating him your birthday weekend? This sounds like something posted in one of my parallel parenting with a narcissist groups. Do not deviate, he has the same parenting plan you do.", "NTA - What your ex and his GF did is a **huge** coparenting no-no. Any changes he wants to make to your schedule have to be run by you first, the same way changes that you'd like to make have to be run past him. That permission part is in your divorce decree... it's the law for you both.\n\nThis is purely on your good will, and it sounds like your ex kind of burned that up by booking first and asking later, then guilting you. You're NTA no matter what you decide to do here.", "NTA \n\nIt's your weekend to have your shared child. His girlfriend booking a condo after you denied a swap is not your problem.", "NAH. He made a mistake, he acknowledged it, and he\u2019s offering reasonable alternatives. If it\u2019s really important to you to have your sun on your actual birthday, then that\u2019s your right. But if it\u2019s a \u201cprinciple of the thing\u201d and you\u2019re sticking your heels in, then I change my vote", "You have a parenting schedule for a reason. NTA.", "NTA. For all the reasons that you mentioned, this was foreseeable for everybody.\n\nHowever, I respectfully like to suggest something. Unless you're willing to die on this hill, and consequently, face similar inflexibility on his part when you want to temporarily alter the custody schedule, proceed carefully. Are you trying to \"teach your ex a lesson\", or do you really, really just *want* your son present on that day?", "NTA.  Don\u2019t make him mess up your plans because of his weaponized incompetence.  He is trying to guilt you and beg but if you want to say no, say no without worries of being an asshole.", "NTA he messed up. He has no consideration for your birthday or the coparenting schedule. it\u2019s odd he pulled this on your bday out of all weekends in the summer. You have every right to be upset and have every reason to say no.", "NTA stick to parenting plan and you made plans. His own damn fault not checking dates.", "Nah, and I say this because OP said they have a good co parenting relationship and mistakes happen. If this was a reoccurring situation, I would say NTA. Yes, your ex has moved on and no longer remembers your birthday and that can sting but set that aside and ask your son what his preference is. If he wants to go, and you don't allow him to, he's going to ruin your birthday weekend with a likely bad attitude. If he doesn't want to go, awesome, nothing further to talk about with the ex about the vacation. Your son is old enough now, that his feelings and preferences need to start being taken into consideration with the custody agreement. Wish you the best and happy early birthday \ud83d\ude42", "Info: do you have plans for your birthday weekend or not yet? Would your son enjoy a trip to Florida?  \n\nI know you are irritated and he admits he messed up, but if you don\u2019t have specific plans just yet and your son would like Florida, I think you are reacting emotionally to him not considering your birthday/feelings.  And you and your son might be better off just taking the high road, negotiating the next two holidays and keeping a good parenting relationship - he will owe you one.", "NTA. Is he this clueless or is this some sort of weird power move by him and/or GF? (Waiting until the last minute to ask you is quite suspicious.) Anyways, don\u2019t give in. Like you said, not your problem he can\u2019t look at a calendar.", "NTA.  His explanation sounds sus and he can go with his girlfriend.  All the people saying \u201cBut your son might want to go!  Why not leave it up to him?\u201d - because he\u2019s 11 and it\u2019s not actually good for him to be responsible for these decisions.  That\u2019s part of why parenting schedules exist, so children don\u2019t have to choose between their parents on special occasions.  It\u2019s also so you don\u2019t have to keep negotiating everything and can each get on with your lives with some stability and predictability, which is also good for the child. \nAnd OP is allowed to want to have her child, who she loves, with her on her birthday.", "I think you need to ask yourself what is best for the child, i dont think YTA or NTA here, who cares if its your birthday... ultimately what is best for you son?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnswer that and ull be good to go", "NTA but can you compromise? You get him for your birthday and he can go the next weekend and you can trade for another holiday. You don't say that you have plans for Memorial Day weekend so that might work for everyone (and your child gets to go on a beach vacation too)", "Some of these Y T A votes are throwing me off: y\u2019all screech into the void that coparenting schedules/custody arrangements are important and should be followed accordingly but wanna bash on OP that she wants to the spend her birthday weekend with her son WHICH FALLS ON HER WEEKEND anyway. Like wth? \n\nI guess she can give up another weekend but I have a sneaky feeling that this recent lapse of judgment has something to do with the GF, to whom the ex is catering to instead of you know checking the calendar he has access to? \n\nIdk but my vote will be NTA as the post is written to us. Ex husband goofed. Live and learn.", "I don't think you're an AH for wanting your son on your birthday, but I don't think your ex-husband is an AH for asking. What does your son want to do?  He's old enough to be asked what his thoughts are on all this.", "Slight yta. He's human and he made a mistake. You may be right on a technicality, but that kind of thing goes right around.\n\nYou don't mention specific plans, or even your son having fun. Just being peeved that he didn't remember your birthday. If this is the tone you want to set for coparenting go right ahead, but no one is going to come out the winner.", "YTA\n\nYour kid will have more fun spending the time on vacation. It\u2019s sad but an 11 year old kid doesn\u2019t enjoy the same thing as a 30 year old woman. \n\nYour ex made a mistake. Don\u2019t punish your kid for his mistake. Instead, spend your birthday doing great adult stuff and enjoy your son the next weekend.", "INFO-Which would be more fun/enjoyable for the child? Is there a compromise so the child can have 2 very great times with each of their parents.", "YTA I guess. You seem to be saying no for no reason. Why not compromise?", "I think NTA but at the same time what would your son want? I know it\u2019s your birthday but how about Memorial Day weekend? Can\u2019t you swap for another holiday? It is your weekend so you\u2019re NTA buuut I think you could try to accommodate a little bit not for him but because your son might have a lot of fun", "YTA. I'm assuming your son would enjoy a Florida trip? While I get being annoyed at your exhusband,  it's coming across as childish behavior to put your preferences over your son's..... like you're 30 years old,  not 10, I think you'll be OK on your birthday.", "I guess what is your parenting schedule like?? Like one week on and one week off. Or mom gets him school days and every other weekend?? \n\nWhy can\u2019t any weekends in June or august work for him? How many weekends from May to august does dad get? \n\nI can\u2019t say YTA or not without actually knowing how many weekends he has. Because sounds like you have two weekend in a row so just curious if dad only has like 1-2 weekends this summer and If so why those other weekends he has can\u2019t work. \n\nHow is his money situation? Would double pricing be a huge deal to him and he really wants to do something nice for your son but only able to afford it during the cheap time?", "INFO\n\nWhy not just ask your son what he wants to do? If he wants to go with them, trade his birthday week.\n\nIf not, well you have your answer.\n\n\nPersonally I think these blanket statements of \u201cit\u2019s my week, no if ands or buts,\u201d is gonna be a nightmare co-parenting long term. Ever want your son on his week? Well, good luck it\u2019s his week", "YTA, I get that there's a schedule, but what's going to be more fun for your kid, going on vacation for his birthday or hanging out with you for yours? I say this as someone coparenting right now. There's gotta be compromise and understanding and doing what's best for the kid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
