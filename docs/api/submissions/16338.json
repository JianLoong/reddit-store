My 30th birthday is coming up on the 20th of May. \n\nMy ex texted me tonight and asked if he can take my son to FL with his GF for my sons Bday (which is in august btw) may 18-21. I reminded him that that\u2019s actually MY birthday weekend so we are picking him up early on the 19th to have him for my real birthday on the 20th. All of which is shown on our parenting schedule that we both have. He then asks if he can have the next weekend instead. I sent him a screenshot of our parenting schedule and said no that we have him for Memorial Day as well. I ask if there\u2019s really no other weekend in the entirety of the summer he can take him. He responds a little while later saying his  GF has already booked a condo starting on the 18th and they\u2019d loose that money and the only other weekend for the summer they could make work is in July but is double the price.\nHe acknowledges that he fucked op because he has all the same access to our parenting schedule as I do (not mentioning the fact that we were married for 7 years and have only been divorced for 3 so I feel like my birthday should still be a little bit of a memorized date but whatever). He offers to trade me his birthday and another holiday to make up for it.\nBut I REALLY want to say no because I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice time with my son on my birthday because he can\u2019t get his shit together and look at a calendar! We coparent great together and have minimal issues but this is really getting under my skin.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: my birthday weekend we have a cabin booked for a fishing trip which me, my son, and my current husband all enjoy. We did it last year and our plan is to do it yearly. Def should have added that to the original post. \nOn Memorial Day we also have our extended family camping trip with pretty much all my family. Aunts, uncles, cousins. We plan it each year based off mine and my cousins parenting schedule either on Memorial Day or 4th of july and this year we both have our kids on Memorial Day.\nI don\u2019t think my ex\u2019s GF is being intentional. She is very kind and genuine and wouldn\u2019t have any idea what my birthday was unless my ex told her. \n\nTLDR: my ex wants to take my son out of state during my birthday weekend and is trying to guilt me into saying yes even though he\u2019s the one that fucked up.", "created_utc": 1683166496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1376yd3/aita_for_wanting_my_son_for_my_bday_wknd/", "score": 405, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he stays with you to celebrate your birthday, he may very well feel he's lost out on a great trip with his dad. But if he goes with his dad, he may spend your birthday weekend feeling guilty for having fun that doesn't include you, knowing in his 11 year old mind that he 'chose his dad and the trip' over spending your birthday with you. As I said, my sons were confronted with this numerous times because my ex is a bit of an ass. I had to really fake the whole 'Go and have fun with your dad! Enjoy every minute of your trip! We'll celebrate XYZ when you get back.' with big smiles, so that they didn't feel any guilt or worry that I would feel sidelined. \nYou're NTA, OP. All I ever really want for birthdays, Mother's Days, Christmas, etc. is to see my kids, to celebrate with them. I understand.

No where in this post did I ask for someone to please guess how I\u2019ll react if they\u2019ll take them. That\u2019s not fair not necessary. You don\u2019t know me or my situation outside of this and it isn\u2019t helpful to post something like this. If you have a view on the initial post go ahead and share it- otherwise you\u2019re not helping.", "The point is the ex and his gf should notbhave made these plans without looking at the custody schedule and speaking to OP.", "Good pint but legally it is mine based on the court ordered parenting schedule. It gets so tricky.", "I get wanting to give the gf the benefit of doubt but when you get involved with someone with a parenting plan, you better triple check that plan so that you actually *have* the child for the dates you want to book.\n\nGf might not have been an intentional asshole but it was still an asshole move to book without checking, especially as that is not her kid.", "Or they'll cancel it altogether and tell the kid it's OP's fault, or they go in August but limit their activities and again tell the kids it's OP's fault they can't do this or that fun thing.\n\nThis is the playbook my ex works from. It's tough to navigate, because you don't want to give in and allow yourself to be manipulated, but at the same time, you don't want your ex (or ex's SO) taking it out on the kid or making them feel like they have to choose sides between their parents.", "Then he should if made sure it was on a weekend where he had his son. It\u2019s not OPs fault the dude can\u2019t read a schedule.", "I got that, this was an early birthday trip though wasn't it? She said that the dad said other dates didn't work? I think she's being selfish but I also tend to put my wants and needs last as a mom and maybe that's not healthy either", "He\u2019s 11 year old! Not month! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "With all due respect, I can only go off what you wrote. It seems to me you are not being very understanding with this situation. Your child will have an amazing time in Florida and your ex offered another date which you are also saying doesn't work for you. This is why I said what I did. I just think it was a question that didnt really need asking if you are honest with yourself and your son doesn't care about what a court drew up, he will care that he is missing out on a wonderful trip away with his father because of a pice of paper.\n\nIn response to the part about creating power trip problems, I say this because the amount of comments ive read repeatedly staying you are right because of the schedule, the schedule, the schedule, like the schedule equals the power. It is there to ensure a fair and happy balance for your son, its not about you or your ex husband. Keeping him from going for your needs rather than his enjoyment is your right/power but an unfair one.", "I think it's okay to deviate from the schedule. There are always going to be times when they each need to move things around. The best way to co-parent is to acknowledge that it's in the best interest of your kid(s) to be slightly flexibile.\n\nBut OP has things booked- it's reasonable to say, No- we already have stuff booked/scheduled for both weekends.", "So does your ex get ANY weekends in May?\n\n\nYour birthday, then mother's day, then Memorial Day. \n\n\nI've never seen a custody arrangement that doesn't give moms mother's day and fathers get father's day.", "You said that you were picking him up early, you need to ask your son. At the age of 11, he deserves a say, and while it's your weekend. That is your choice to ultimately say no, but his voice does matter. \n\nAs a mother, I get that wanting to spend your birthday with your child, but also taking into account your child's opinion is okay as well. Maybe, meet in the middle with the father on this one if the son does want to go. You have 7 more years of this balance.", "Something I thought of is that she may of lowkey tried doing a trip in May since that\u2019s usually the start of summer vacation for most kids? And when that didn\u2019t work offered Memorial Day which is usually a holiday anyways. And August, when the kids Bday is, could fall into school time. \n\nIf I was a parent I\u2019d prefer kid misses last day or two of school vs the first week.", "Who said it was? I'm responding to someone who said they could go without the son, which doesn't really make sense since the son was the whole point of the trip.", "My thoughts exactly", "It's not a diff scenario. It's the same one: a parent planning something the child will be excited about on the other parents scheduled time. Why is it fair to make/let the child decided when it's one weekend and not when it's two weeks? The answer is that it's not.", "It is literally 10x as long of a time period.", "Nta. Who celebrates their kids birthday months in advance? And why would the kid want to hang with dads gf on his birthday?", "Not too sure on this one. Could you clarify a couple of things for me?\n\nYou're picking him up early was this previously agreed? \n\nHe's offered an alternative weekend? But you've said no to that too? If he's agreed to let you pick your son up early for your birthday could you not alter the schedule and let him have your son on memorial Day? Seems pretty fair to me. He's offered some additional trades and I understand wanting to keep your birthday but is memorial Day not a tradable day?\n\nI don't know it just seems like you're being a little bit spiteful. While yes he hasn't checked the schedule but surely between the pair of you could work something out? Especially if he's adjusted the schedule so you can have your son early for your birthday. \n\nAlso the TLDR says \"my son\" not our son which is hinting a little bit more towards the spiteful behaviour.\n\n\n\nAt the minute leaning towards a light YTA.", "NTA. But I have been in your shoes. What I did was give my son the choice of what He wanted to do. He did go on a few trips w his Dad but at this point he won\u2019t. He tells his dad nope it\u2019s moms bday then.", "INFO what does your son want to do? At 11 I think he should at least have some input on this. He doesn\u2019t get to make the final decision, but I would explain his options in NEUTRAL terms and ask what he would like to do and then take that into consideration.", "NTA\n\nyou seem to want to believe they had the best of intentions, but i really think it was deliberate, and if it wasn\u2019t then his response should be to move it, not offer make up days when it\u2019s that big a plan. his GF shouldn\u2019t have booked the condo before the dad even cleared it with you, which means it was just the courtesy of informing you, not asking permission. you don\u2019t spend money like that if there\u2019s a chance it isn\u2019t going to work unless you get accommodations that are refundable or give you a credit. \n\nmy dad and his wife got married on my dad and mom\u2019s wedding anniversary, which his new wife was the maid of honor for. they claimed they didn\u2019t remember because it was so long ago but she also couldn\u2019t be upset about it because it was so long ago, and (sorry about the irrelevant tangent here) they\u2019ve moved on so she could have done that also. i feel like i would have trust issues, but they\u2019ve still got a way of making her feel like she has to be nice and supportive with them because it\u2019s water under the bridge and irrational of her to not want to be around them. the guilt and manipulation is subtle and they would swear they\u2019re being decent and not malicious but at the very least it\u2019s selfish. \n\nyour ex and his GF are being selfish if not deliberate, and your trip was already planned and scheduled out with MULTIPLE PEOPLE involved. he didn\u2019t ask, he expected you to say yes.", "NAH It sounds like your communication over this has been reasonable, from both sides.  Please do not let this explode into something more.  He acknowledges his mistake.  Keep working on a solution.  Modeling good co-parenting and conflict resolution is more important than any deposit, holiday, etc.", "NTA Poor planning on his plan doesn\u2019t necessitate an emergency on your part.", "NTA he should have planned better, however don't be surprised if there is a lack of flexibility in the future.", "NTA. the responsibility is shared and he didn\u2019t do his part by not scheduling the schedule before booking. maybe it was a mistake, maybe not but it is still his duty to make sure he\u2019s covering all his bases when it comes to your son. and i find it hard to believe that this trip for your son happens to only be possible on your birthday weekend, especially seeing as his birthday isn\u2019t till august. enjoy your birthday weekend with your son and hopefully dad will learn to be more thorough in the future", "it\u2019s definitely a power move. scheduling a bday trip for their son on her birthday weekend when the son\u2019s birthday isn\u2019t till august is definitely giving off bad vibes. and then the last minute attempt to switch knowing the calendar, i think they thought they could guilt op into switching", "this! why is he taking his son on a bday trip months before his actual birthday and how is it conveniently falling in line with op\u2019s birthday? that doesn\u2019t feel like an accident", "yeah, his logic really doesn\u2019t make sense. especially when you consider that this was supposedly a birthday trip for the son but his birthday isn\u2019t until august", "Great response! Play the long game, for everyone\u2019s sakes.", "I was wondering that too\u2026 is this an understandable oversight? (I get they should have checked the calendar, but if it were not a birthday followed by holiday weekend would one normally have been Ex\u2019s)", "this! it\u2019s super fishy that he claims it\u2019s a trip for the sons bday yet his bday isn\u2019t till august. and what are the odds the trip clashes with ops birthday weekend? i find it hard to believe that he never once checked the calendar or remembered that it was op\u2019s bday", "it\u2019s very possible but that wouldn\u2019t explain the not checking the calendar/booking without consultation. either dude isn\u2019t the smartest or him/his gf may be trying to start problems", "yeah and he was \u201casking permission\u201d but they expected a yes which is completely on them for being careless if not downright thoughtless", "I think you misunderstood. It's the mom's birthday weekend and they made plans and she WANTS her son. The father's girlfriend booked a vacation that is the same time and the father WANTS the son to be with them.", "yep. he asked but it was really \u201cinforming\u201d otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have booked it without getting the okay. careless at the very least but they have to own that mistake, not make her pay for it when she did everything right", "agreed! booking a birthday trip for the son the same weekend as his moms birthday when his birthday isn\u2019t until august? either they didn\u2019t actually want him there or they thought they could force op\u2019s hand with no problems", "agreed. a non-refundable birthday for the son that clashes with op\u2019s birthday despite him being born in august and that weekend being op\u2019s time with him? it\u2019s not adding up", "Honestly assuming that someone you were married to is going to remember your birthday date does not seem that crazy to me, and she is also the mother of his child, so her birthday (and also his) are important dates to remember when making the schedule.\n\nAlso, wanting to celebrate your birthday with your children is very common, it's an important date for a lot of people. The kid is not missing anything that important or significant by staying with his mother that weekend.", "[deleted]", "THIS. he has access to the same calendar as she does so it\u2019s really convenient that he booked a birthday trip for his son (months early may i add) that coincides with op\u2019s birthday. it seems intentional and they lose nothing by not having the son as they can go by themselves. the whole situation seems fishy and i find it hard to believe he randomly chose that weekend knowing he doesn\u2019t normally get the kid on those days", "this!! it doesn\u2019t make any sense that they\u2019re taking the son on a birthday trip the same weekend as his mothers birthday, seeing as the son was born in august. i understand early celebration but 3 months and the exact same weekend as his ex? that\u2019s not a coincidence. the whole thing reads fishy to me and op is simply sticking to their schedule, one he has access too as well.", "Oh in that case, NTA. You have big plans. Those are your scheduled weekends. They shoulda checked the schedule before putting down money. It's unfortunate, but I think dad has to eat this mistake. Hopefully he can plan something later in the year that actually works for all of them.", "Yeah exactly!", "Have you just gone out of your way to target my replies right now and say the same thing over and over? There\u2019s multiple notifications that you replied to me under different threads.", "Honestly assuming that someone you were married to is going to remember your birthday date does not seem that crazy to me, and she is also the mother of his child, so her birthday (and also his) are important dates to remember when making the schedule.\n\nAlso, wanting to celebrate your birthday with your children is very common, it's an important date for a lot of people.

But always on the same comment.", "When coparenting, it's a common manipulation technique for one of the parents to try to force these situations and **rely** on the guilt card of  \"So, son... how would you like go on a fun trip to Disney World in two weeks with us rather than spend a plain old weekend with your mom? I'm sure she'll want you to be more happy and have more fun with us than you'd have with her... Sounds like a great time, right?  Let's go call her and tell her how much you're looking forward to going and when we're leaving!\"\n\nKid gets hyped and excited, then gets crushed when the other parent wants things to be as scheduled... in a legally binding divorce decree. One parent using weaponized incompetence and guilt to squeak out extra changes whenever they want is a slippery slope and turns into an expectation after that behavior is allowed. I've lived this. Letting yourself get steamrolled just leads to more steamrolling.\n\nYou ask the other parent first if the change would be okay, if they say yes, make the plan and tell the kid... if no, you don't make the plan.

There should be no situation where guilt is used to push a change through.", "At the same time they\u2019ve been divorced for at least 3 years. And OP is a grown adult. It could be a cultural thing but most people in my family stopped doing birthdays past our childhood years since at that point it\u2019s literally just a date. \n\nEven when my parents divorced they sort of just stopped trying to memorize every single date that was important to the other as at some point it\u2019s just to much and does distract from the life they\u2019re trying to make without the other.", "even while considering all that, it is still the responsibility of the gf and the ex to double check all dates before booking anything. it is also their duty to run that by op before doing it seeing as their split seems to involve her having most weekends. the blame should be on the ex, i cant speak to the gf but the father should have confirmed what dates were and were not available before putting everyone in an awkward situation", "There are a lot of adults that like celebrating their birthdays and that want to do it with their families.
