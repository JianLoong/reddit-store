I own a second home that currently is being rented out to a few people as a shared house. The master bedroom is now up for rent as the previous tenant moved out, and my FMIL wants to rent my room. The location and neighborhood is perfect for her, as well as the size of the room and amenities.  She\u2019s willing to pay the full rent and sign a lease but I told her I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to have a landlord/tenant type relationship with her, and she's really upset and has refused to talk to me for days now.\n\n\r  \nMy reasons for not wanting to rent is primarily because the long term purpose of this house is for my parents to eventually retire in when the time comes\u2026 maybe in 5-8 years. I expect my parents to move in and have the whole house to themselves eventually, it\u2019s my retirement gift for them. My parents and my FMIL has met once before and they absolutely did NOT hit it off, because not only did it became apparent that they come from very different background and social statuses and therefore have very different topics of interest and opinion on things, FMIL got so drunk at their first meeting, she started getting really loud and also made a comment about how she\u2019s glad I am a lawyer because her and her daughter\u2019s futures will be \u2018taken care of\u2019 by me. That rubbed my parents the wrong way, but they liked my fianc\u00e9 and trust my judgement so they\u2019re just going along with it. I know if FMIL were to move in, she will not be moving out on her own accord as my house is in a city that she has always wanted to retire in. I think I\u2019d be in a very weird spot in about 5 years having to kick her out in order to let my parents move in. \n\n\r  \nI\u2019ll admit secretly another reason is also because I\u2019m concerned about her being late or completely missing paying rent and having to handle the awkwardness of dealing with that. Maybe I am an asshole for being concerned about that since she doesn\u2019t have an eviction record and don\u2019t think had problems missing rent at other places she\u2019s lived in before, but I do know that she is an alcoholic with a gambling addiction and has filed multiple bankruptcies, one very recently and is always asking her kids and multiple ex husbands for money so I do not want her to get comfortable with me and end up trying to live rent free. I don\u2019t want to have to go the legal route to stop her from that, it sounds like a nightmare. \r  \n\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is ok with whatever I choose to do. She personally confided in me she too don't have confidence that her mom will pay rent regularly and told her mother she thinks it's a bad idea, her mom is mad at both of us but me specifically.
