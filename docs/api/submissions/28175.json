I have a three-year-old son with my ex-husband, but he hasn't been involved in our lives since October 2021. \n\nAs a single mom who is also attending school, I took him to court, and he now pays child support as ordered by the court.\n\nRecently, my ex-husband's girlfriend reached out to me on Facebook. She asked me to stop making my ex-husband pay child support because they just had a new baby and are struggling to afford formula. In response, I empathized with their situation but explained that the child support is a legal obligation my ex-husband willingly agreed to when he brought our child into this world. Ultimately, their financial difficulties are \u201ca you problem\u201d \n\nI understand that my response may have come across as harsh, and I feel a sense of guilt for expressing it that way. However, it's important to acknowledge that my ex-husband made the decision to have another child, and it is not my responsibility to intervene in his relationship or financial matters. Each individual is accountable for their own choices and the consequences that come with them.m\n\nTDR: I told my ex husbands gf that it\u2019s her problem they can\u2019t afford to feed they\u2019re own kid. My ex husband says I\u2019m an AH for making him pay child support. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: I am fortunate to reside in Canada, where I am currently pursuing my education to become an Early Childhood Educator (ECE). The demand for ECE professionals is high in our country, and I am grateful that the Ontario government fully covers the expenses of my program. Additionally, I receive a generous monthly allowance of $500 after paying rent. I am able to manage my finances effectively and live comfortably on an annual income of $13,740. In contrast, my ex-husband enjoys a substantial income of $70,000 and lives with his mom, not paying rent.", "created_utc": 1696381912, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16z9jw7/aita_for_saying_that_sounds_like_a_you_problem_to/", "score": 4247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a matter between you and your ex-husband alone.

Karma is a bitch sir!\n\nFather's just don't understand the financial burden they leave the mother of their children with.  I have a buddy who pays $300 a month for 2 kids and makes about 100k per year.  Mom makes 40k and has primary custody. Yet he bitches and moans about how she bleeds him dry. I said dude seriously? You can't even feed 1 kid for a month on $300. (Teenage boys) She makes just enough to get by. Yet you are okay with watching the mother of your kids struggling? You have ATV'S, boats, motorcycles, etc. If you think your head is on straight? You need therapy. Because you are a selfish asshole. Again, if the mother of your children is struggling? Your children are actually struggling more. They are questioning whether you really love them, they are struggling with mom, and they don't have the emotional maturity to understand what's going on. Even watching your children so the mom can work? Is helping! Cutting out childcare expenses if they are that young helps tremendously. It also helps your children emotionally to see you. You are part of their identity. Teach your sons how to be men and your daughters how to be treated by men. Be a good parent! Get along with the mother! If she is an asshole? Take her to court and force children in the middle and parenting classes. You can do that. Support the mother anyway you can. Do not ever let your girlfriend or wife take over or be their mom!!! You are their parent! So it's your job to parent, and all decisions go through you!!! If your new lady acts jealous or tries to separate you from your children? She has to go yesterday! Kids 1st! Nut up or shut up! I promise you. If you own your responsibility as a father? It will pay you back 10 fold plus! \n\nTo be clear, the girlfriend has absolutely no place being involved here. None! I'd talk to dad only! If he wants to play games? Tell him you are perfectly fine taking him back to court to raise his child support and get back pay or help with medical. That will get his attention. If she puts her nose in ever again? I will take you to court! You are correct. It is his decisions that led him to where he is. Guess they need an additional job or a better paying one. Responsibility is obviously not their strong suit.
