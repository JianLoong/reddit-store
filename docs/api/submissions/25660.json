{"id": 25660, "submission_id": "162r2w0", "title": "AITAH for not celebrating my daughter's birthday?", "selftext": "Let me start by saying that birthdays and holidays are a big deal in our family. We are fortunate to be able to celebrate one another with gifts, cakes, parties, etc. My spouse (M47) and I (F39) have three children Juliette (18F), Marie (16F) and Thomas (9M).   A typical birthday is our family is breakfast in bed, the person chooses how to spend the day, gifts (\\~$300-$500), cake and any dinner they would like either at home or out.  We don't take off work or anything but try to make whatever time we have together special.  We all enjoy being celebrated but Juliette is the birthday queen.\n\nThe issue is that Juliette diminishes other people's birthdays, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Christmas. I remind her prior to and day of, will say something so she at least acknowledges her sibling's or dad's special day. For Mother's and Father's Day, she straight up pretends like it's not happening despite everyone else making plans. A few times, she has signed her name to a card that Marie buys.  If I give her money to but her dad, siblings gifts, she often keeps it or buys something generic like a coffee cup for someone who doesn't drink coffee. This year on my birthday, she didn't come home the night before for the first time ever. She ignored my calls, texts for a few hours then showed up around 10 am with an \"I'm sorry, I fell asleep at Brianna's.\" It felt deliberate, but I am an adult and told her it hurt my feelings, then left it alone. On her sibling's birthdays, she often picks fights with someone in the fam, ignores them or does something distracting from the person's day. Despite reminders, this year for Thomas's birthday, she just wasn't around after telling him she was going to spend time playing Minecraft with him. She came home for a few hours in the evening (after work), told him happy birthday at my request, then went into her room, got ready and went out.  Last year, after she turned 17, I sat her down told her how hurtful it was that she doesn't like to celebrate anyone else but revels in being celebrated. She acknowledges her love of being celebrated but significantly overestimates her effort and makes excuses for her behavior.  I've made small comments previously (ex: \"It hurts my feelings when you ignore dad on Father's Day, he provides everything for us\") and began telling her that this year, she is going to get the same amount of energy that she puts into everyone else on her birthday. Well, today is her 18th birthday. I've purchased her favorite cheesecake and bought her a card along with a $50 Target gift card. It makes me like the AH because I know that despite my warnings, she is expecting the usual.

Where in this are you open to finding out WHY your daughter is acting this way, without judging her?\n\nI personally find holidays and birthdays, especially other people's, oppressive. I LOVE grabbing someone a little gift for no reason, or planning a meal train for a friend in need. I love sending random notes of appreciation. But I hate the expectations and pageantry of most birthdays and holidays. And I'm hardly the only one who thinks caring for others is a year round thing, not a commercial holiday thing. \n\nIf people want to do a bunch of nice stuff for me on my birthday, that is their choice. I always try to be gracious about gifts and attention, but often they are unwanted and even intrusive.  But, it's not really my place to tell people giving me gifts and planning me parties to knock it off (esp since I usually have already said clearly \"I really don't want anything.\")\n\nIn your insistence that everyone in your family enjoys celebrating (which you say multiple times), *your* version of \"celebrating\" feels forced on Juliette. You use the example of Father's Day...well, are there other examples of Juliette showing her dad appreciation that aren't on the sanctioned day of the year? Because Designated Day Of is CERTAINLY not the only way to appreciate someone\u2014it's just the one that makes stores money. \n\nJust because \"everyone\" loves it doesn't mean she needs to. And obviously, she does not love it\u2014her actions are a clear protest of this grinding tradition. Her reaction to her own party/gifts\u2014which you guys have CHOSEN to do\u2014is immaterial. It might be graciousness, it might be acceptance of who you are as a person (something you could try showing to her), or maybe it's pure unadulterated selfishness. \n\nRegardless: she doesn't want to participate in holidays, and it doesn't make her a bad person just because YOU do.", "YTA, if such events are important to you then you should put in the same amount of effort for everyone. It seems that she puts the same amount of effort for everyone, just not as much as you would like. If you go all out for everyone else and skimp on her you are saying to her you are not worth as much as the others.

This year, it seemed she was particularly cold on special occasions.  But as a mom, its hard to tell if I'm being overly sensitive because I'm paying more attention to this behavior.\n\nI would celebrate a stranger's birthday who needed it in the same way we are celebrating her's.  It feels like the bare minimum.  And shitty.  I love the kid so much.  It sucks to not treat her the way she hopes.", "This is my biggest concern for her.  It's very difficult to develop and maintain loving relationships when you revel in your needs being met but make little or no effort in meeting the other's needs.\n\nEdit: spelling", "This has been a topic of discussion for five or six years with her.  She always has an excuse or reason as to why she doesn't put effort in to others.  Ex: \"I got in a fight with my friend and was upset.\" \"I was tired\" ect.", "A couple of reasons, her bio dad is not a good person.  I won't expound on that because my perception of it is likely not the same as hers.  She was two, Marie was one, when we left and he's played little part in her worldly life since (his choice). She met her dad/ my spouse when she was five.  He is the best man/ father/ husband I've ever known and has adopted, treated Juliette and Marie as his own.  However, that isn't enough to compensate or make up for her perception of that role.Then, she had a tough time transitioning into middle school.  Over the course of a few months, she grew sad, started losing weight and acting out unusually.   This is when I started reading parenting books.  Therapy came up in one of them, I asked her and she would be open to it and she said she thought it could serve her.", "That is the million dollar question. I could go down a rabbit hole about social media, but will make it short. She\u2019s a classically beautiful girl, constantly gets approached, has hundreds of millions of likes on TikTok and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. In my opinion, she believes the rules are different for her because of the attention she gets in the virtual world. \n\nWe took away her iPhone and replaced it with a flip phone a little over a year ago. A friend bought her a new iPhone and she pays for it herself.  Again, too little too late. My na\u00efvet\u00e9 allowed this to go too far.", ">You raised her this way.\n\nI don't think that's entirely fair to say, and want to push back on it a little.  OP and her husband raised all their kids with what sounds like plenty of modelling of the kind of behavior they wanted to instill.  They provided an example towards each of the kids, and an example the kids could see in their behavior towards each other (I assume).  \n\nOP also indicates that they've been trying to address this with her directly for some years.  So it's not like they just let it happen and never said anything.\n\nThe extent to which I'll agree with this, though, is that the time to get MUCH TOUGHER with her was several years ago, when it was clear that trying to talk it out wasn't having any effect.\n\nOP should have drastically reduced what the kid was getting for her birthday long before this, for one thing.\n\nFor another, reading through this, I'm kind of shocked at how permissive OP seems to be with her daughter.  Such as: it's the youngest kid's birthday, Juliette promised to do something with him for it, on the day-of she ghosts him by going out most of the day, returning for a short time, then... going out again?  This is in addition to the story about her going out and just... staying out all night, with the excuse that she fell asleep at another kid's house.\n\nLike, OP, why were you not FREAKING OUT when you could not get any answer from  your daughter and she didn't return home until the next morning?  How did you discipline her for that?  Why, in the above example, did you not forbid her from going out again on the evening of the youngest's birthday, when she'd been out all day?\n\nUnfortunately, what I'm getting a sense of from reading this (and from OP's comments) is that OP and her husband are very permissive, and have a really hard time with disciplining the kids.  They don't seem to have a problem communicating their expectations, but there are no consequences when expectations aren't met.  There doesn't seem to be any attempt at correcting bad behavior?  Just hand-wringing and more talking.  \n\nWhile I applaud the idea of first trying to talk things out with  your kids, especially as they get older, it should have been obvious long before this that that wasn't working.  And then, you need to keep PARENTING.  Which involves setting rules and boundaries, and consequences for breaking those.  I'm not seeing ANY hint that this kid has ever experienced consequences for her shitty behavior, until this very moment.\n\nUltimately, you can't force someone to FEEL a certain way, or to gladly do something they don't want to do.  Whatever is going on with Juliette that makes her so uninterested in other people's emotions, and so clueless about the idea of reciprocity... who knows.  You could TRY to teach her that even if she doesn't FEEL it, she has to DO certain things.  But the best way to teach that, and arguably the only way, is to tell her that she has to DO things, and reciprocate what she is given, if she wants certain outcomes -- like people going all out for HER.\n\nThat seems to be what OP is trying to do now, and that's a good thing.  I just have a feeling that it may be too late.", "Haha, I'm not a fan of this approach at all!  But the same actions are yielding the same results.  We have all hugged her and told her we loved her when we wished her a happy birthday at different times today.  Hopefully she feels that way without the extra frills.", "So, we don't expect songs and dances for parent's birthday's mothers/ Father's Day.  In fact, we host extended family for mother's and fathers day each year so I am cooking and cleaning and trying to make my in-laws, siblings, and their spouses feel special.  \n\nBut I do respect the 'she's a teen, I'm a parent.\" I just don't know how to get her to understand that her actions matter in way that will affect her.", ">You should celebrate her birthday.\n\nOP did buy a cake and a gift card...but the family isn't going all out this year as in previous years.", "We've tried addressing this type of behavior for years, but clearly haven't done enough.   Thank you for your honest, direct opinion.  I agree wholeheartedly.", "Sorry, today is her birthday.  I will edit that, thank you.", "To clear up the misunderstanding, Juliette has celebrated her birthday several times over the last three weeks.  She refers to August as her \"birthday month.\" She enjoys the pageantry, gifts and attention more than anyone in our family. She revels in it, talks about how many friends make birthday posts for her and tells strangers it's her birthday or will be if given an opportunity. That's the issue.  She wants to be celebrated but doesn't want to celebrate others.  \n\nBut you are right, she is paving her own path.  My concern is that if she expects to GET, she has to be able to GIVE also. This isn't just with family, it's every relationship, every transaction.", "Even when her behavior hurts others?  I'm not worried about my feelings but it's sad when her nine year-old brother says Juliette doesn't love him because she ignores him 99% of the time. Or her 16 year-old sister feels worthless because Juliette lies to, hurts or uses her.   Not just on birthdays, the other 364 days per year.  \n\nBirthdays do seem non-negotiable.

One day she'll thank you", "That\u2019s not a very good reason & this is strange behavior since she has been raised to celebrate with family. Does she actually like the attention & gifts? Y\u2019all raised her so you must have some idea where this attitude comes from. \n\nAs a Mom of 4 \u201ckids\u201d (now 26,26,28,30) I personally wouldn\u2019t buy her anything. Just have cheesecake. With or without her. Let her do whatever she wants & enjoy her birthday. Don\u2019t do this to teach her a lesson. Do it because you\u2019re willing to accept that she clearly doesn\u2019t like a lot of effort to be put in to celebrating with family.\n\nLet her know there are other ways to show you care about her & for her to show that she cares about her family. Gifts are not that important to people who don\u2019t really need or enjoy them. So let her tell you what she would like to do (not get) on her birthday. Then do that. Skip the presents.\n\nIf she is truly just selfish ... well that\u2019s different then just celebrating birthdays. Then she selfish all the time.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any asshole here ... NAH ... just sounds like living with teenagers\n\neta \u2014 based on your replies you have bigger problems than birthday celebrations. It appears that your daughter is not interested (or willing) in giving her family respect & kindness. That\u2019s a totally different issue. You may need some help from a professional. She needs some better boundaries & consequences for that behavior.", "That you for your reply. So bio-Dad abandoned her. Started attention-seeking behaviors at a young age and they haven't stopped, only grown worse. It sounds like you tried, sometimes your best isn't good enough. NTA.\n\nI was phishing for more information because something didn't make sense. With the broken home so young, dad abandoning her, and now the Tik-Tok thing, it is starting to come together. Your remarriage killed her chances of having bio-Dad as a father. She was too young to understand why that would have been a bad thing. Couple that with what is typical with not wanting to get overly attached to the new dad because he will just up and leave also. And now mom's attention is taken up by new hubby and additional siblings. So acting out and withdrawing.\n\nYou had some hope with the therapy until the Tik-Tok thing became her drug of choice. Attention is a powerful drug. Especially for someone who is attention seeking.\n\nI don't want you to feel like I'm defending her. I'm not. At some point, her mental health is her responsibility. She has not chosen to accept that and she is 18 now. The result is she has chosen to estrange her family. That's on her now.\n\nSo yeah, you're not the A H. \n\nDisclaimer, not a mental health professional. Just a random redditor.", "Part of our permissiveness has been my upbringing.  I was not treated well and berated, beaten for any perceived misdeed.   All I wanted was to be loved and for someone to care what I had to say and I projected that onto my children, to Juliette's detriment unfortunately. Not that I should have hurt her but I should have done something else. The other part is that we were doing what the therapists and professionals recommended.  \"No rules!\" \" Just love her and listen to her!\"  \"She knows what she needs!\" The last part is exactly as you suspected, inconsistency.  Sometimes, we prioritize prepping for a meeting or whatever instead of following up with why she didn't walk the dog.  That has happened more than it should.\n\nWhen she didn't come home the night before my birthday, I didn't realize it until the next morning when I awoke at 6 am.  Then yes, I was distraught because it is out of character for her to not be home on time.  I called/ texted all of her friends, enlisted help to see if we could find her.  To me, it felt like she was intentionally trying to sabotage my day, but upon reflection, that felt selfish so I left it alone.  She was grounded for two weeks after I confirmed that she told me the truth about where she was.  For our son's birthday, the context is that she was working during the day but told him she would hang out with him when she got home.  Instead, she made plans with her friends.  She got his hopes up and didn't follow through.  \n\nWe do discipline all of our children.  Our other two are receptive to guidance and course correction.  When they aren't, they are punished in typical ways.  Car taken away, no screen time, write and delivery apology letters.  They figure things out and learn from their mistakes.  Juliette, not so much.", "Honestly if you are not a fan of an approach and you are doing it anyways, you already know something is off about it.

It reads as little immature on your end.", "Here's the thing - in 30 years when Juliette hasn't really treated her siblings any differently, things will kinda be the same. \n\nYou can't change who she is and you can't take away the disappointments of her siblings because she's not the big sister they had hoped for. \n\nHow do I know? \n\nBecause my brother was like Juliette and he never really treated me any better. Now we are no contact because he's not nice.\n\nIt's not my mom's fault.", "Really, don\u2019t make a make a post about birthday parties if in reality it is something else. If you feel that there are issues with her acting out all the time then make a post about that. My point still stands, you want to punish her for her actions, that is why you are skimping on her birthday. It\u2019s up to you if you want to get to the bottom of why she behaves the way she does, if you do I suggest therapy - individual and family. And if you do want to \u201cfix\u201d what is wrong, skimping on her birthday is a bad first step. I went through a similar experience with my younger daughter, it was a surprise to me during therapy sessions how much she was hurting, which was causing her to lash out.", "Thank you, I make a lot of mistakes but my intentions are pure.  Here's hoping she grows into a strong-minded trailblazer and we can laugh about this together someday <3", "She's been in therapy from age 12 until May of this year when she started refusing to attend.  We've done family therapy, my husband and I have seen parenting specialist affiliated with her therapist for insight without compromising her confidentiality. It is bigger than birthdays, that is just the weight being carried today.\n\nAs a mom of four grown kids, you certainly know what it is like to feel like a failure as a parent (even though I'm sure you weren't truly a failure).  We use every tool in our toolbox but still fall short.  When things are tough, my spouse and I often joke about how someday we will reminisce and laugh about the situation.  Hopefully, you've gotten there and are truly laughing and enjoying time with your family. \n\nThank you for your insight.  I appreciate you.", "Honesty question- do you have kids?  If so, are you a fan of disappointing them?  I was saying that in gest and have not attempted to shirk responsibility for the situation.", "I'm very sorry that you had to make the choice to give up that relationship.  Although it's not your mom's fault, I bet she would still do anything in her power to fix it.  Sending you positive thoughts.", "Point taken. We\u2019ve done therapy, family therapy, have a library of books I\u2019ve read to understand. She is very different from our other two kids, which is a good thing but I am clearly not good at helping her thrive. I regularly ask my children, spouse \u201cwhat can I do for you today to make you feel loved\u201d and try my best to be approachable. But I know I try to make too many things lessons and just don\u2019t understand what she needs,  hence my question. Thank you for your honesty and sharing your experience with your daughter.", "Oh sweetheart you\u2019re not a failure. You can only lead them to water... you can\u2019t make them drink. There\u2019s always going to be a shake your head, WTF moment & you gotta laugh.\n\nShe\u2019s forging her own path. As much as you may hate it... it\u2019s happening. If you can do the thing that no parent ever wants to do & just let her go ... you may find other qualities that you respect about her. Sometimes you have to hold on very loosely. If she wants to be a lone wolf then draw your boundary lines of what she can expect from you. We accept you like this but you can\u2019t have it anyway you choose. Life doesn\u2019t work like that. Consequences suck no matter how old people are. She wants to learn the hard way ... that\u2019s her choice. \n\nShe will eventually learn her family is not something to take for granted. Whether she owns her own behavior is anyone\u2019s guess but you won\u2019t ever be able to force her to be thankful for what she has... she\u2019s going to need to learn that lesson on her own.\n\nWish you & your family all the best!\n\neta \u2014 my husband & I have always joked about if we could combine our twins they would be the ultimate perfect person. Lol \u2014 instead they are just 2 flawed people like the rest of us.", "thanks, yes my poor mother is fixated on wanting to fix it, I wish she could just accept that it is broken for now. thanks again.", "Here is the thing. I don\u2019t think your ur going to fix it. The only thing doing this is going to accompany is for her to resent you and her siblings.\n\nAs far as her not spending time with her 9 year old brother there is a big age gap. She isn\u2019t going to want to spend a huge amount of time with him. \n\nSisters fight. \n\nBut here is the problem you want her to be a big sister that she doesn\u2019t want to be. Your punishing her for expectation that your installing in your other kids.\n\nAnd to be quite honest your way of celebrating birthdays is not realistic. No one spends a. Whole day celebrating birthdays. Others have other things they want to do then to spend the day to celebrate one person.\n\nYour sitting your kids up for disappointment when their significant other don\u2019t do this", "I mean this in the most respectful way possible, but your posts all seem very \u201cme\u201d centered. I\u2019m getting a lot of I do and I feel. You seem like the type of personality that takes charge and runs things. This may not be the case and if so you can ignore this, but I think the best thing you can do is during a therapy session just sit back and listen. Tell the therapist and your daughter that you are there for her and want to listen to what she has to say. We all have blind spots and it doesn\u2019t make us bad people, but I would bet that when you ask her \u201cwhat can I do to make you feel loved\u201d she doesn\u2019t believe you actually mean it and it is probably based on something in the past that you did that made her feel that you don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not saying that you did something horrible on purpose, or even at all, it could be something that she misunderstood or processed wrong. Again my younger daughter is a lot of work and gets upset and hurt about even the tiniest misunderstanding, but she is worth the work and it is easier now that I understand her better.", "This is fair and true. It\u2019s unfortunate to assess retrospectively, but many of my parenting choices were rooted in my childhood.  I grew up in an unfortunate situation, was subjected to abuse in many forms and have been on my own since 15. Got myself into another bad situation, had two kids, got divorced, put myself through college in two and a half years while working and taking care of my babies alone.  Alone other than the kindness of an old boss who was endlessly patient with me. I wanted my kids to have everything I didn\u2019t and sacrificed to give it to them. I provided those supports because that\u2019s what I needed, not what Juliette needed. I did my best but my mentality definitely affected her negatively.", "You've certainly given me some things to ruminate over.  The balance between speaking for others/ sharing my POV is not my strong suit.  I really do appreciate your input and observations.\n\nIf you don't mind, how many children do you have? Is your daughter you referred to significantly different than your other children?  If so, does she accept being parented differently?", "I have two daughters, and both are significantly different. I hate to phrase it this way but my older daughter is and has been easy to parent. She has her own issues, which I am starting to see now. Her anxiety is more internalized, which I am now seeing was probably part of the reason she was so was easy, she is always worried about what people think of her. Parenting isn\u2019t easy and we all will make mistakes. I\u2019m not suggesting parenting differently per se, just parenting each child according to their needs. My older daughter understands and wants what is best for my younger. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not easy and still sometimes after a really bad day it flashes in my mind to give up. I don\u2019t want to diagnose your daughter, but with mine the worst of it happens when she feels discounted, whether real or imagined. If yours is the same get ready for her acting out worse. Good luck, with work I believe you can make your and your families relationship with her better, I\u2019m rooting for you.", "One more thing I want to add. Confirmation bias is a real thing and it affects us all. That means that we will place more importance on some actions and ignore others. One example that is used is the toilet seat, when the husband leaves the seat up you notice it, when he doesn\u2019t you don\u2019t, so in your mind you say he always leaves it up even though it is probably under half the time. I encourage you to take a strong look at all of your daughter\u2019s actions and see if you are seeing the bad ones and ignoring the good ones. It can be tough, because she is supposed to act in a good way so it doesn\u2019t stick out like acting bad does, but it is important for realizing that she isn\u2019t always bad.", "This is a good reminder and I do catch myself doing this.  Thank you."]}
