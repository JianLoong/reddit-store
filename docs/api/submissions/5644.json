Charlie commented on the surprise that Max was older than he thought and he didn\u2019t realise there was such a big age gap between us and my mum laughed and said Max was obviously not her son. \n\nWhen he was leaving, Charlie said it was wrong of me to not tell him that Max isn\u2019t my brother and he questioned why I was hiding it.

This is just one of those things some people don\u2019t get but it\u2019s totally normal to others. I refer to close friends kids that have known me their whole lives as my nephews and nieces. I have aunties and uncles who aren\u2019t technically related but they\u2019ve been chosen family for a long time. My roommate has a dad who is a close friend who\u2019s like a dad and not blood. \ud83d\ude02I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal or lying particularly to call people family that are chosen family v.

My partner also refers to some people as his siblings when they are either cousins, close childhood friends, etc. It took me a while to piece together the family tree, but it's not like I'd ever get mad at him about it. \n\nI think he is more upset at his bruised ego for your mum saying he wasn't her son. That, or now he all of a sudden thinks you're banging your \"brother\"  If that's the case, y'all are only 4 months in and he knows where the door is. You don't need that childish crap.\n\nAlso, another cultural aspect, I was never allowed to call my siblings \"step\" or \"half\" - we were all siblings no matter what. There wasn't this \"hierarchy\". To everyone saying that OP is in the wrong for not disclosing these things, I think you need a reality check that families exist in all different ways, and to demand OP declare the hierarchy is just weird.", "NTA. \"He's not biologically related, but he is family and has been since my childhood. He's my brother.\"", "NTA\n\nWe have a similar situation in our family. I view the girl as my niece and my kids view her as a cousin and we don\u2019t think anything of it. Others might question it once they know she was basically adopted by my brother and sister in law as a 19 year old and some even think it is strange. However that doesn\u2019t mean we are AH\u2019s for not explaining the whole situation, to us she is family. \n\nJust because your bf doesn\u2019t quite get the situation that doesn\u2019t mean you were trying to hide something.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou really should have explained that he wasn't actually your brother, just a very close family friend. I don't think it's a huge lie, because he clearly is treated like a brother (I had an \"uncle\" who wasn't really my uncle - my grandparents just took him in off the street when he was a kid and raised him as one of their own).

There is no way this wouldn\u2019t come up and be easy to specify at some point.\n\nI know this because my cousin came to live with us when I was young and we often refer to each other(my brother her and I) as siblings and my parents treat us as such- even today when we all are now married with kids of our own.\n\nBut when getting to know friends, there are ways where this detail can come up as you talk about childhood, family and experiences.\n\nIt\u2019s super weird to be with someone for four months having an intimate relationship- not just friends- and that never coming up in conversation.\n\nEdited to add: all the comparisons made here in comments about cousins, aunts and uncles isn\u2019t the same. Siblings typically share homes and are raised/living together at various points and is a different relationship than the others compared to. Having had direct experience with this, there are definitely ways in which this should have come up as you were both getting to know each other.", "NTA my beautiful brother passed away recently and I was always avoiding  having to explain the complexity of our relationship. I loved that guy like my brother, knew him since forever like my brother, it was wayyyy easier to say 'my brother ' than go into the finer details of why this person was important to me.

If you consider him your brother than he is your brother, and how that relationship came to be isn\u2019t the important part.

These are the details you share when building this sort of relationship with people and no way in talking about childhoods, family traditions it doesn\u2019t come up. Here he finds out directly from the mom right away.\n\nMost of my friends know my sister as my sister, but people involved intimately definitely know bc her birth mom is my aunt and alive and so is her dad. This sounds similar in your case where they have birth parents. Max doesn\u2019t have a family, but I\u2019m sharing about family things he wasn\u2019t always there in the home for all of their things growing up- it was only when he started working for the dad that he became a part of the family- so I\u2019m sharing details about life and childhood this would have come up at some point.\n\nI would find it weird to be taken to my partners family home having talked about our family members and then learn this from the mom as though it\u2019s no big deal. By not sharing it means either she didn\u2019t trust him to share or just didn\u2019t and I would question why.\n\nYou are entitled to your own opinion, but I\u2019m entitled to mine and I GREW UP with the one that is my sister- not just someone close to me that I choose to call a sister, but someone that lived in my home and shared my parents and brother with me, and whom I talk to almost every day, and I feel this way. Those close to me that I share intimate details with do know the truth bc it comes up naturally in talking about life experiences, relatives, etc. \n\nShe isn\u2019t talking about a random friend but a man she is serious enough with to bring home overnight for the holidays!!!"]}
