My sister is perfectly fine with it", "You were dishonest. No one likes to be lied to. He probably felt dumb for not knowing. You embarrassed him. \n\n\rHow hard is it to say - *my brother, not biological, but he is considered family* or something like that.\n\n\rIf you can't see and admit your lie by omission, then he really can't trust anything you say. No one has time to ask for the fine print during every conversation to make sure they are understanding the full truth since you lie so casually.\n\n\rYou are probably a very nice person. Maybe you want to try to be honest. \r Happy Holidays.", "Nta at all ...family is choice ...as someone interviewing to become part of it they would do well to remember that distinction. Unless it came up organically I'm not sure I would even think to explain it... not withholding information or anything but just something i wouldn't think to mention unless asked but there is a bit of a cultural slant to my perception on this in my case Sicilian Italian 2nd generation of my family born in the US ....aunts and uncles and cousins all over the place some by blood some not and some people we've adopted along the way ....but it doesn't matter the respect is the same", "YTA \n\nYou could have said, he's like a brother to me. I is not that complicated.", "YTA for lying through omission .You can no longer ever be trusted again. you are a liar.", "YTA.. sort of. This isnt wrong per se but its weird. I see people's point that biology and family arent the same but brother is very specific. Its not *really* like calling someone uncle. \n\nI feel like your mums reaction effectively seals it. \"my mum laughed and said Max was obviously not her son.\". If you're inviting your bf to hang out with all of them, its not just your relationship to him that matters but how he fits in to the whole scene. Clearly your mother does not think of him as a son so I can see that you did put him in an awkward spot there.", "I have a \"brother\" like this. I don't think it's weird at all. Someone doesn't have to be blood related to you to be family.\n\nNTA", "Personally, I agree. \n\nOne of my uncles isn't technically a relative in that he is not a blood relative and isn't married to any blood relatives. But he's been my uncle all my life. The fact that we don't share blood/DNA doesn't mean anything. And when I talk about him to friends/partners, I refer to him as my uncle. If they probe I will openly acknowledge that he is not a blood relative, just a longtime close friend of my dad's, but it doesn't actually matter at all. The only reason I bother to clarify at all is because my father has no biological brothers and is as white as they come, and my uncle is a gay black man, so sometimes people get confused/curious. \n\nJust because he isn't related to me by blood or marriage doesn't mean that he isn't family. End of story.", "Upvoted this as he did make a mountain outstanding a broHill - OP not the AH", "Depends on who ya are honestly. My best friend of 17 years, I just refer to him as my brother to everyone. I don't have any brothers my blood, so to me he's just my brother. One had an aunt come in from out of town. Mentioned something along the lines of \"Heading out for a few, my brother needs help with something\" and she gave me the most bewildered look. Had no idea what the issue was til it finally clicked who I was talking to. She just laughed after I explained.", "A lot of replies here have said that it can come down to a culture thing but I think it\u2019s more so just an individual family\u2019s thing. My family, immediate and extended, have always taken in people who don\u2019t have families of their own. There is always a place at our table and in our hearts for more people. I have so many cousins who aren\u2019t biological cousins. I have two brothers who aren\u2019t biological brothers. Family can be found rather than born. I constantly forget to mention that two of my five brothers aren\u2019t biologically related to me because it doesn\u2019t really matter. They\u2019re still family. And my guess is that it\u2019s the same for OP. \n\nThis guys been a part of her family since she was eight years old. So why is it so weird that she doesn\u2019t think to mention that it\u2019s not blood that connects them but bond?", "It's the case with my country for sure. Anyone who's close to the family is Aunty, Uncle, cousin etc. I've grown up around adults who have no blood relation to my mom or dad but I've called them honorifics for as long as I've known them", "It\u2019s like calling someone your cousin because of the similar country of origin, where I went to school for a bit any time we met another Hispanic kid we\u2019d joke how some could be their cousin due to where they came from", "My mother's friend is named \"Anne-Marie\". as a kid I thought it was \"Aunt Marie\"\" and just assumed she was another aunt.

Now I do it sometimes for fun", "Fellow Aussie here - explains the mind set", "NTA,\n\nHe\u2019s drowning himself in a glass of water!", "NTA you are related, just not by blood. Is he one of those weirdos who thinks it's his right to know any time you're in the vicinity of a man you don't share DNA with? If so, rest assured that he is and will always be the AH.", "Four months is early for me too, but then again a boyfriend of 4 months would not be dropping by at Christmas.", "Family, no. But relatives does actually mean blood (or marriage/law) related. If the OP had said Max is her family, or that she loves him like a brother and considers him one, that would have been one thing, but saying he is her brother when he is a close family friend is another. Lots of people have, say, honorary aunts and uncles, but they usually explain that it's a parent's best friend or something.\n\nAlso, I call BS on it being \"easier\" to just refer to him as a brother instead of \"going into the whole history\". What history? Is it really such a complicated hardship to say \"Max is a close family friend, I see him as an older brother\" to your boyfriend, who will meet him eventually and will hear the story anyway at some point? That just creates confusion down the road, and it was certainly not easier for your boyfriend to feel like a fool who thought Max was a bio brother. I can understand not explaining to, I don't know, a salesperson helping you pick his present, but why couldn't you spare a few seconds to talk to your boyfriend about someone you are so close with?", "Except  the OP didn't say that, did she?", "Yeah, I mean, the whole thing is far more complicated even than adoption. Because my mum is not really old enough to be Max\u2019s mum and it\u2019s not like my parents ever made the choice to adopt him. That said, the business relationship between him and my dad, the fact that he\u2019s a very close friend of mine, and comes on family holidays etc., makes him closer to family.", "But Max being a close family friend who you consider your brother is hardly a \"private\" matter. Four months would be too early to spill intimate family details, but if this guy is dropping by your mother's at Christmas, surely you can tell him the a actual relationship between you and Max?", "In India, someone might say 'woh mera bhai hai' - meaning he's my brother. \n\nAnd it could be anything - a genuine blood sibling, a cousin, a relative, someone from the community, a neighbour, a friend, brother from another mother... just anything.", "I have an aunt that I only found out a couple years back was actually just my mom's best friend. If I was a couple years younger when my one of my related aunt passed away, I would have not known that my \"brother\" is actually my cousin. My family just never discusses the \"Oh we aren't ACTUALLY related\" part.\n\n\nOP's family has pretty much adopted Max, I feel like it's kinda rude to just go around saying \"Oh I think of him as a brother but we aren't actually related.\"", "When I was a young teen my parents were close to another couple, their kids were treated like they had become my cousins. Years later when that couple got divorced and the eldest son kind of fell through the cracks my mother took him in for a while until he joined the military, while living with us he became more of a brother than cousin. Even after my own parent's divorce and the remarriage of one to someone who already had kids, my brother was closer in actuality to being an actual brother than my 'stepsibs' had ever been. Even after I went NC with just about all of my extended family and disowned the parent who got remarried to someone with kids, he was the only person I still counted as family and we treated each other the same as brothers.\n\nThe idea of introducing him as anything other than my brother feels weird (even if we haven't talked in years).

None of the times were in great detail, it was like \u201coh yeah my brother has one of those\u201d, or \u201cme and my brother went to Paris last spring\u201d. There was no point at which it occurred to me, or organically came up that when I said brother I didn\u2019t mean a relative, it was just never relevant, and honestly I forgot.", "That's how I am with my best friends kids. I call him my brother too on occasion"]}
