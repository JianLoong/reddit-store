And don't think she's ever \"forgiven\" my husband and I for getting pregnant less than a year after she had her first kid and give \"subtle jabs\" at how I'm a stay at home mom and my \"easy life\" ever since my oldest was born.  Her kids are 15m and 12m. \n\nAnyway for Christmas this year my husband(40m) got himself, both our children(14m and 13f), and myself each a steamdeck for Christmas. He and I have been enjoying ours and our kids have been glued to theirs. Naturally they took their new toys with them to grandma and Grandpas when we went to visit, like most kids do with new tablets and games. \n\nMy sister lives with my parents because we'll frankly rent is too dam high for a single mom with two kids in this city. I can't blame her plus then mom and dad have someone close if there's an emergency.  \n\nAfter we got done with our extended family Christmas my kids got out their steamdecks and started playing, and their cousins were playing on the new phones their grandparents got them. \n\nMy sister had some sort of attitude once my kids got on their decks, saying how kids should be spending time with their grandparents on the holidays not their toys. Never mind that's what hers were doing.  A while later I guess my niblings started bothering my sister about how next birthday they wanted a steamdeck too. I guess this made her mad because she came into the kitchen where mom and I were making supper and started ranting at me about how we spoil our kids and how we should think how that will affect others and their kids and not raise ours to be entitled brats. \n\nI didn't quite understand what was happening nor did mom. Eventually she said she \"knew\" we only got our kids such expensive gifts to make her look bad and make her kid jealous because I \"always\" have to one up her after she does something.\n\nI kinda lost it and I told her to shut it, that my hubby and I just wanted to give out kids nice things, we couldn't care less if her or her kids are jealous or not. We are parents not competitors.\n\nIt all kind of blew up from there.

But it sounds like this is an ongoing problem between the sisters and it started years ago.", ">I'm not a big fan of insincere apologies. \n\nDoesn't have to be insincere. If OP decides to be concerned about sis, it can be a sincere apology. There really is no need to lose your temper just cos someone else does. They might have an understandable reason, but you know yours is wobbly -- you're just doing it cos they did. Sis said silly stuff & OP did too, so let it blow away nicely. Easy pease. OP is already ahead for having such fancy gifts her sis lost it.", ">so let it blow away nicely.\n\nIn your strategy, how does this \"let it blow away\"?\n\nThe sister will just keep continuing this behaviour. And everyone will have to cater to her and apologize for her feeling insecure.\n\nSo how does it get better in your opinion? Just magically?", "In my experience treating people nicely normally goes ok ha ha. Sis wasn't close to landing a blow, there's no risk here to worry over, this isn't drugs or hotrods.

Lol", "NTA- I have been very honest with my children about the cost of things and how many hours it takes their father and I to make X amount of money to pay for things. \nWe have also explained to them that the amount someone is paid is not an indicator of how hard they work. We take opportunities like this (I have a very rich brother who can afford to travel and do all sorts of cool things with his family) to teach our children financial literacy and mindfulness. It is sometimes very hard but I think they are more thankful for everything they have and are less likely to feel like we are depriving them of something.", "NTA\nYou don't have to modify your parenting to placate your sister. Her assumption you do things to one up her shows how much she has a main character delusion.  Too bad your mom is so scared of her meltdowns.  Keep an eye on whether she's bullying them. Her living with them may not be as beneficial as you assume.", "Mom says I may not have been in the wrong but it would be nice if I had my kids keep their things off of social media and away from my niblings so my sister doesn't have more \"melt downs\". \n\nThis right here is why your sister is the way she is.

You're allowed to buy nice things for your children for Christmas and don't need anyone's permission to do so.  One or more of the niblings' friends likely got one for Christmas so if it's not their cousins they are seeing with them it's going to be them. I daresay they are happy with the new phones they got and the turns they will get on your kids' steamdecks. Kids that age understand their family's financial limits and usually fully accept it without any jealousy or issue, they are content just having a play with things when able to.\n\nHaving said that if they want one badly enough it seems like it's within the mother's reach to save that much over the course of a year for them given that she lives rent free ( going by the USA prices I just looked up of the steamdecks ). Or she could even go halves with your parents and/or have the kids contribute to it as well if they get money from any relatives for their birthdays or Christmas as I assume most kids their age do ( if they don't they can request money instead of a gift to start saving towards one ). Your sister has a serious jealousy issue with you if she really thinks you choose your kid's gifts with the evil intention of one upping your niblings' ones and intentionally making them jealous.", "NTA.

You are there to spend time and visit with family. If you want to bring a newly gotten gift from home, how about a gift that the group can enjoy TOGETHER, like a board game or something. Nothing wrong with devices, but there is a time and a place.\n\nIt's like that saying that when lying on your death bed, no one looks back and says \"I wish I had worked more, rather than spending time with my family.\" Same can be said now with all the technology and devices - \"sure wish I had  spent more time on screens, rather than making memories with my human family.\"", "Thank you for this post.

I never could understand people who are spiteful jealous of their family/friends having more or doing better.  They was always an inspiration to me to strive to get what I need and want for me and my children and this is what I've taught my kids.  If I succeeded, great but if I didn't, well, slight disappointment but I knew that I tried and came up with alter plans.", "I agree, no need to rub it in.
