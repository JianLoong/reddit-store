Just make sure that they make all the decisions, and you just pay for it, otherwise the step mum would be able to say you manipulated it to your favour", "NTA but if in the US, get them signed up for LegalShield.

It removes any conflicts of interest with you being involved.\n\nAnd given the nature of the family, would provide them with a lawyer on call if needed (as well as any other matter they need).\n\nI can personally attest to their services as I am a client of theirs.", "NTA, and you need to rephrase this. Your not paying for the will to be redone your lending money to a family member that needs some assistance to ensure their child's future.

Asking Reddit to make up your minds for you shows just how whupped you all are by evil stepmom.\n\nJUST DO IT ALREADY!!!!", "YWNBTA - The biggest mistake they can make is to give the kids and the money to the same person.

Their estate plan is theirs, not the step mom even if she paid for it originally. Estate plans aren't a one and done. It's fluid and needs to be reviewed every year. For instance, a bank might balk at a 5 year old plan that's never been reviewed.\n\nIf they can't pay to have their trust reviewed, you are more than welcome to do that. Since those changes will more than likely require a notary to begin with, it adds a great legal protection in the event step mom tried to challenge the legality of the plan as the courts would way more than likely side with the notary who witnessed and performed the signatory process. But since sm paid for the original with the stipulation she be made guardian, she may not want to challenge that.", "NTA\n\nIf the parents can't afford the fees to change the will and trust, **loan** them the money.

This is a very kind thing you're helping them with.", "Honestly this is really a legal issue and not an asshole situation.\n\nOf course you would NTA if you did it but the issue is that the manner in which you do it could impact whether there is some kind of will contest if the worst happened and both of the parents died.\n\nI am a lawyer but don't take this as legal advice.\n\nFirst you can separate the \"money\" and the guardianship as many people have money handled by someone who is financially savvy and the children raised by people who are good at parenting. They can both be the same but they don't have to be.\n\nYou can set up an initial meeting with a lawyer who can give you advice on the best way to proceed given the potential complications. This can be something that you do on your own. You can have your SIL come along but if she has issues with \"over sharing\" just do it on your own without involving her in any way and then act based on your advice.\n\nA complete estate plan - i.e. a Living Trust; Will, Power of Attorney isn't that expensive and is really just forms that are typically done by a paralegal.

So what if your wife's stepmother finds out you gave them money that they happened to use to change their wills! She can accuse you of being controlling all she wants, but that won't change the fact that the wills have been changed. If she says anything to you, just smile and say \"You're projecting, Stepmom\".

I say since all of you are in agreement as to who would raise their kids in the event something happened to them, just change it, tell no one, and make sure that you have a fully signed and witnessed copy available if the need arises. no one will be the wiser, and hopefully it will never be needed.", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But I'm worried if it got out that I paid for it, my wife's step mom would try to...\" ...

They refuse to act independently. Wife's step mom threatens to pull financial help any time they disagree.", "Op I guess I should have asked, who is the trustee of the trust. Generally if you have a trust as in revocable living trust the will is generally part of the trust to avoid the probate process. So you have your living will, POA's for health and financial with a pour over will that transfers everything not currently in the trust into the trust on death of the last successor trustee. If mom is the trustee of the trust, you will need a whole new rlt and the estate planning attorney in the language will invalidate the current trust (very important). But without really knowing the current trust, it's hard to say.", "I don't know for sure. My wife and theorize that it's because it's not a fun thing to pay for. New video game? Have the money. Diapers for the youngest? Don't have the money, have to ask wife's step mom. It makes no sense.", "Maybe not that easy, all depends on who's the successor trustee(s). Anything not in the trust is subject to probate. That's why when you have a trust, you have to fund it. Writing things on a paper that's not in the trust is a wish until probated and a court may not side with that directive. If mil is listed as successor trustee, they would have to remove her. If she's part of the trust itself ie john mary AND Joan revocable living trust, they need a new trust with the specific language invalidating the current one.", "When the second kid was born. They asked us if they did paperwork, could they put us. My wife and I said yes. We found out 6 months after that, that wife's step mom paid for them to get it done. Sis in law started making comments about how they wish they had the money to change it. I asked her why. And that's when she told me that wife's step mom had said she would only pay for it if she would be guardian. Sis in law has mentioned wanting to change it to my wife and i multiple times since then. Im only wanting to help because Sis in law has mentioned. Idc if they don't make it my wife and I.

I wouldn\u2019t make it a you problem.\n\nIf they don\u2019t want her holding things over their heads, they need to make some changes so they can support themselves.", "I'm not sure exactly what went with the trust and will, but my sis in law has said that wife's step mom is on all of their documents. Like sis in law got life insurance free through work and wife's step mom is the second beneficiary. Anything with second beneficiary is wife's step mom.", "I don\u2019t think your the AH cause it seems that your heart is in the right place. I wouldn\u2019t do it though. They need to be responsible enough to handle their own estate planning and you paying for it could be seen as influencing them. Hope it all works out.", "A trust isn't probated - that is the advantage of a trust as you can avoid probate and have the assets pass directly to the beneficiary without going through probate. Less expense and no delay while probate occurs.\n\nSomeone can obviously sue even if there is a Trust but then the ball is in that person's court so to speak and they have the burden of bringing a suit and having a substantive legal issue to contest. With a probate - whether it is contested or not contested - it has to go through probate.\n\nThat is why people set up so-called \"Living Trusts\" where the \"owner\" of the trust controls all of the assets until they die and then they go immediately to the designated beneficiary. Typically if it the parent's Living Trust the children are also Trustees and so they can immediately access the Trust. I was a Trustee for my father's Trust after he died and so I was able to handle all of the paperwork as well as pay any expenses immediately as I had access to all of his accounts - banking and brokerage. While he lived I had no right to use any of the assets for myself - only for his benefit and towards the end of his life I took over his finances to make it easier for him so I paid for his living expenses, medical care etc. as I had authority to sign his checks. If I had used his money to pay even a cup of coffee for myself unauthorized I would have been stealing - not that I had even the slightest urge to use his money for my own.", "I want to stay out of it, but I feel for the kids. My wife's step mom is weird about blood relations. The older kid is not my brother in laws bio kid, he is adopted. And my wife's dad and step mom treat him a lot differently than the youngest who is my wife's step moms first bio grandkids (out of 13). The oldest also has autism and my wife's step mom uses that as ammunition to not spend time with him or interact with him. We really want to go NC with wife's step mom and dad but we are worried that if we go NC, sis and bro in law will go NC with us as well.", "Yes which is why I stated anything NOT in the trust. Which would be subject to probate sans beneficiary designation.", "That is where an attorney is helpful because you do have to change ownership of all your assets so they are held in the name of your trust. \n\nWhen I set up my Living Trust,  I had to change the deed on my property and have it recorded with the Trust as the legal owner; change all of my brokerage accounts as well as checking and banking. Personal property like cars and household items are just covered with general grating language"]}
