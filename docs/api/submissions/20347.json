{"id": 20347, "submission_id": "14geofj", "title": "AITA for suing my sister in law over snakes?", "selftext": "So, for context I a 21(f) buisness owner. My business is based around reptile education and breeding. I mostly breed pythons, anacondas, and some rat snakes. I love my work and feel incredibly lucky to be able to have this job. \nSo, I had my family over for dinner one night to celebrate my wife\u2019s birthday. When family comes over I always close the basement door and leave a sign on it letting people know not to go down there unless I or my girlfriend are there. However, I had to run out to the store because I forgot to get a bag of ice (and my ice maker has been broken for like two years) and while I was gone, my sister-in-law took my two three and five year old nephews into the reptile room so they would have something to do. While I was gone and my nephews were downstairs they started messing with the cords that controlled all the heating and lighting to the room. This included the heating to the incubator which was packed full with snake eggs (all for that season) which brings in the majority of my revenue. Before I got back my sister-in-law and nephews came back upstairs for food and I didn\u2019t even know they had been down there.\nI went to bed right after they left. The first thing I noticed the next morning was that all the automated lights were off because the timer had been turned off. I figured that I must have bumped it until I realized all the timers for lights were off. Then I checked my incubator and realized something was seriously wrong. The inside of the incubator was WAY too cold. \nI panicked and checked every single bin and almost all of the eggs had gone bad. There were probably 12-15 that were still good. For comparison the day before, there were 230 good, healthy eggs. I immediately asked my wife if she knew what happened and she didn\u2019t. So I checked the cameras and clearly saw my sister-in-law and her sons going through the room and messing with the chords. You could clearly see them fully UNPLUG the power strip connected to the incubator. \nI called her to confront her about it and she told me to, \u201cCalm down.\u201d\nThese animals mean everything to me. Not only that, as I said, breeding is the majority of my business' profit. So after talking to my wife and trying to talk to my sister in law to no avail, my wife and I found a lawyer and took her to court. During that case, the judge ruled that my sister in law had to reimburse me and my wife for the dead snakes. But since they hadn\u2019t hatched the judge decided that she would have to pay based off how much I brought in from breeding the previous year which was close to $75,000. \nMy wife and I were resolute in that decision but we have constantly badgered me and my wife telling us we are terrible people for suing our family.

If this were a retail establishment and she had gone into a room with adequate signage and camera systems where it was employee-only access and proceeded to cause 75,000$ worth of damage every business on the planet would have her arrested and sued into the ground for damages. Will it make you any family friends? Probably not. Is it (and let me repeat this one more time) seventy-five thousand dollars of damages to your small and extremely delicate business? Yes. You are absolutely NTA. And don't let this woman or her children near your snakes ever again.", "NTA. Family doesn\u2019t automatically mean no consequences. I know there are a TON of people who\u2019s main source of trauma and injury have been family. Been there done that with my mother\u2019s side of the family. \n\nStick to your guns. \n\nIf you had been physically injured and unable to work due to something your SIL or nephews did, there wouldn\u2019t even be a question. Your SIL knew that your nephews messed around with the cords, and CHOSE not to say anything. She also specifically picked a time when you were out of the house to go down there, knowing what she was doing was wrong. Don\u2019t let her off the hook, and teach your nephews about personal responsibility.", "NTA. If they'd gone into any other business and caused $75K in damage or losses, they'd be getting at least the same treatment, if not also criminal charges (based on the dollar amount). You sued the people who cost you $75K in profit . . . and they also happen to be family members. \n\nJust because you're family doesn't make any difference. SIL deliberately waited till you were gone, disregarded your verbal request, and ignored signs and closed doors - this almost sounds like it was malicious.\n\nI suppose if they'd wanted to avoid being sued, SIL could have reimbursed your losses when you first approached her but she actively chose to avoid you instead. She brought this on herself with her initial actions and subsequent behavior.", "NTA. 75k is basically your earnings for the year and she ignored the sign and her kids. If she controlled them and let them look that is one thing, but she was negligent.", "Nta\n\n\n\nShe destroyed your lively hood. And they killed them.\n\n\nThem she tried to avoid it. You did the right thing.\n\n\nShe is flat out wrong.", "NTA\n\nI'm angry on your behalf. I mean, who the fuck does that? Who just goes in to a clearly restricted room and just starts fucking around with plugs and cable management? Like, what the fuck was she hoping to achieve? And that's even before getting to the fact her interference killed hundreds of animals and cost you tens of thousands in income. No way you're the asshole. She chose this.\n\nCall that the FAFO tax.", "NTA. I would now get a lock just to be safe. 75k is a lot of money to lose due to her stupidity.", "Unfortunate story, but NTA. They had no business snooping around your house, and certainly had no business unplugging stuff they knew nothing about.", "NTA. Firstly as a snake owner, I'm sorry for the loss of your eggs. Secondly your SIL is bordering on child negligence/endangerment. If you have breeding sized Anacondas and Pythons it's a stupid idea to let kids be in the same room and not have your eyeballs on them 100% of the time. Most collectors/breeders don't have locks on their cages but simple latches that the snakes can't open but a child *could*, they could have accidently released a full grown snake. So if they were able to mess around with the cords, she wasn't watching them.", "NTA and I work in law, you did the right thing. Maybe your SIL will have learned a lesson about properly watching her children. Do all you can to collect this debt owed to you. I'd like too see the family complaining throw $75k out the window!", "NTA and I'm sorry. She literally killed hundreds of animals and seriously messed up your business, of course there needs to be consequences", "Why? WHY? Why deliberately unplug clearly essential items??!\n\nNTA. How dare she.", "NTA. It\u2019s what you\u2019re owed. They could have told you when you got back that they unplugged things and given you the heads up so you could fix it, but they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s on SIL.", "NTA. \"Family doesn't sue family\" can be countered with \"Family doesn't fuck family over\" She ignored signs, and took small kids \"so they would have something to do\"\n\nWhat's down there that would interest small kids? \n\nI wonder if SIL has issues with snakes (I'm not enamoured of 'em either but I ain't gonna sabotage someone's business).

Family or no, you suffered a financial loss. She can pay it willingly or she can pay it by court order, but it should be paid.
