My business is based around reptile education and breeding. I mostly breed pythons, anacondas, and some rat snakes. I love my work and feel incredibly lucky to be able to have this job. \nSo, I had my family over for dinner one night to celebrate my wife\u2019s birthday. When family comes over I always close the basement door and leave a sign on it letting people know not to go down there unless I or my girlfriend are there. However, I had to run out to the store because I forgot to get a bag of ice (and my ice maker has been broken for like two years) and while I was gone, my sister-in-law took my two three and five year old nephews into the reptile room so they would have something to do. While I was gone and my nephews were downstairs they started messing with the cords that controlled all the heating and lighting to the room. This included the heating to the incubator which was packed full with snake eggs (all for that season) which brings in the majority of my revenue. Before I got back my sister-in-law and nephews came back upstairs for food and I didn\u2019t even know they had been down there.\nI went to bed right after they left. The first thing I noticed the next morning was that all the automated lights were off because the timer had been turned off. I figured that I must have bumped it until I realized all the timers for lights were off. Then I checked my incubator and realized something was seriously wrong. The inside of the incubator was WAY too cold. \nI panicked and checked every single bin and almost all of the eggs had gone bad. There were probably 12-15 that were still good. For comparison the day before, there were 230 good, healthy eggs. I immediately asked my wife if she knew what happened and she didn\u2019t. So I checked the cameras and clearly saw my sister-in-law and her sons going through the room and messing with the chords. You could clearly see them fully UNPLUG the power strip connected to the incubator. \nI called her to confront her about it and she told me to, \u201cCalm down.\u201d\nThese animals mean everything to me. Not only that, as I said, breeding is the majority of my business' profit. So after talking to my wife and trying to talk to my sister in law to no avail, my wife and I found a lawyer and took her to court. During that case, the judge ruled that my sister in law had to reimburse me and my wife for the dead snakes. But since they hadn\u2019t hatched the judge decided that she would have to pay based off how much I brought in from breeding the previous year which was close to $75,000. \nMy wife and I were resolute in that decision but we have constantly badgered me and my wife telling us we are terrible people for suing our family.

She definitely knew that area was not meant for children and uneducated guests, which is why she snuck in and out before you noticed. \n>This reminds me something of the case in Florida where a man named Chris Coffee bred reticulated pythons. The laws have changed so he was no longer able to keep his snakes, though the state gave him time to rehome all his snakes. Nonetheless his home was raided in April and his snakes were brutally murdered, including a LEGAL boa that was pregnant with roughly $100,000 of babies.

You're talking hundreds of eggs on a commercial scale here and it sounds like you had little/no redundancy measures in place.\n\nAs a teen I worked in a reptile house of a zoo that did a lot of work breeding and repopulating rare species back into the wild, and the breeding setup they had was bulletproof, since we were managing 600-1500 eggs of rare species at any one time.\n\nI would strongly suggest:\n\n1. Doors to breeding rooms need locks, not signs. Yale locks, or another type that you don't have to remember to lock every time. Always assume that people will get where they shouldn't.\n\n2. Each incubator should be fitted with 2 separate temperature alarms and humidity alarms. 1 of each should be mains powered, the other battery powered. Battery powered in case of power failure. Batteries checked regularly and checks recorded. These days you can buy an inexpensive unit that'll do both and message your phone as well as sound off if the temp drops/humidity goes wild.\n\n3. Incubators fitted with 2 totally separate heating/cooling systems, on 2 different thermostats, never plugged into the same plug socket/strip. We used ceramic bulbs on pulse stats, each powerful enough to maintain the heat if the other died. To protect against a failed heating element, faulty stats, blown fuses etc\n\n4. If your property doesn't have a backup power generator, a power bank with enough charge to run your incubator for at least 24 hours.\n\nIf you're only running the one incubator you should be able to implement proper failsafes for around $500-800 (I'm guessing, based on converting what it would cost in \u00a3 to dollars)\n\nEggs are so delicate, multiple layers of protection from accidents is the only way to ensure that as few things as possible can go wrong.\n\nI'm so sorry this happened, it's heartbreaking when things go wrong like this. I hope you can bounce back soon.", "NTA. SIL screwed up and had the opportunity to take responsibility prior to going to court.

I feel that they'd probably be more sympathetic if it had been birds eggs or something that had been ruined.", "NTA. What if you went to her home and ruined $75,000 worth of things she has there? Wouldn\u2019t she want to be reimbursed", "NTA", "You are not sueing over snakes, u are sueing over $75k. NTA.\n\nI can almost guarantee you wont see any money tho...", "Absolutely NTA.  I am also a reptile keeper and breeder and worry constantly about temps and humidity control.  I have back-ups for my back-ups.  If someone did this to me, I would take exactly the same route.", "NTA\nshe may not have known she was causing that much financial damage but she obviously should have known it was a bad idea in some form", "NTA\n\nIf they had mentioned to you that i took the kids downstairs, you could have checked things out. But they didn't do that.", "Nta......by a country mile. Make sure your SIL pays too. regardless of the consequences. Might teach her a lesson about respecting boundaries, other peoples property, and controlling her kids.", "NTA", "No", "NTA. WTF? How does someone do something like that?", "I think the family argument that SIL presented could be flipped.\n\nInstead of\n> we are terrible people for suing family\n\nIt should\u2019ve been family respects family\u2019s boundaries. Family doesn\u2019t let family starve. $75k isn\u2019t chump change; it\u2019s income that people survive on. Poor snakes! And poor kids too, WHO lets small kids play with cables??? Family would\u2019ve never had to sue family if family hasn\u2019t ignored boundaries in the first place\u2026 and then SIL had the audacity to tell OP to calm down. She knew damn well she was never going to admit fault or pay OP back. She learned a hard lesson in not messing with people\u2019s livelihood.\n\nUnfortunately, her own petty actions are now affecting the income and quality of life her kids will receive (since her husband is now making payments to OP)", "And why didn't she plug the *cord back in? Obviously it was important for something?", "Temp alarms are still a good idea because you won't notice any gradual drops and rises in temp right away.\n\nThe incubator at my place is monitored with sensors connected with a mobile app. \n\n\nThat being said. I feel horrible for OP. She's not to blame for their entitled family letting their brats run rampage. NTA", "Yes, it was A Major Chord!", "What did they say, please pass on their deleted wisdom", "Oh that would've been interesting to find your boa constrictor with 3 bulges", "They said something along the lines of \u201cit goes both ways. They always tell you to forgive because it\u2019s family. But nobody seems to think of it like they\u2019re family, so you should do what ever you can to make it up to them\u201d. I\u2019ve only ever seen \u201cyou should forgive them, they\u2019re family\u201d and never, \u201cyou should make it up to them, and ask for forgiveness, they\u2019re family\u201d", "Thank you, that is some solid advice", "Happy to see this, most of these threads act like 3-6 year olds can control their shit. Like nah, they\u2019re sometiems gonna yank on shit and break shit, that\u2019s why you watch them as the parent and don\u2019t let them in the room alone as the snake owner.", "Ah. Then, yep, all good and full steam ahead.\n\nMaybe she'll watch her kids going forward and use slightly better judgment.\n\nI'm assuming she's not allowed back in the house.", "This post is super fake...\n\nYou can't keep the title of girlfriend or wife straight, your post history is all about trying to get into the military while you are saying that this job is your life calling?\n\nStop posting garbage.", " No security or redundancy for what I presume is over $100k revenue. \n\nI\u2019m gobsmacked.", "Ya know there are pills for a reptile dysfunction nowadays", "Nta.", "INFO: Why did they unplug the power strip?", "NTA but use some of the money to put a combination lock on that door.  Because people like your SIL exist and they are A Hs.", "NTA! I LOVE reptiles too but even if I didn\u2019t, this was a clear violation of your business which caused you to lose money.  There is no excuse for her behavior. My mother took a busy bag with me places. It included a doll, coloring book and crayons, a puzzle any other small portable toy that was quiet that I might like while she was occupied. It is not ok for her to use your business as entertainment for her kids because she failed to plan a way to keep them busy.", "NTA, actions have consequences and they found out. I hope you guys are able to collect every cent owed to you and your business can continue to operate.", "NTA. They expect you to just eat the loss of an entire years salary? For what, because her kids were bored for like 10 minutes?", "NTA Good for you for suing", "That kind of damage is no joke. NTA. Also, given the signage, warning, method of entry, and non-notice, it\u2019s almost malicious. \n\nGiven the snakes, wires, etc down there the liability of anything happened is also a real thing.", "You need to invest a enormous ammount of money into the set up and breeding stock before you can at least break even with fancy morphs and saught after species and such. It's not like you can earn a quick buck. And cutting corners will result in a bad rep do you won't be able to sell to anyone.", "Is she your wife or your girlfriend or do you have both?", "Oh yeah, my wife is deathly afraid and I was just joking. Did not expect to see such a high 5 figure # for those eggs.", "Snakes are just flesh wires", "i heard there was a secret chord", "Why is HE making payments when her salary is larger and it's her fault?", "NTA  Holy hell what an utter idiot what did she think would happen \"Oh hey ho he won't care they're just eggs\" - Oh I am so sorry you have had to go through all this this was horrific to read. Those poor baby egg-lings so so sad", "OMG.... that's terrible... I just kept saying Oh No! as I was reading what happened. \n\nDefinitely NTA your SIL needs to take responsibility and realise that she severely jeopardized your business allowing her kids to do that ... but more than that, all those eggs gone.... no baby snakes.... awful!", "NtA this is not only something you love but also your BUSINESS that brings food to the table, she should definitely pay back the damages.   \nAlso I can't help but wonder if she's some \"reptile hater\" and let her kids play there on purpose in  order to endanger your poor snakes :( I've heared too many stories from my family sadly, there are too many people who would hurt a harmless animal because of their own prejudice.", "Nta\nThere's a line in family, when they started stealing, destroying your stuff and especially that will cost your job/money, forget the family shit things. They should know..", "nta", "NTA and I can't understand how you put up a sign and surveillance and make sure to close the door, but not lock it in any way? Like you knew it may happen but decided to tempt fate? When your SIL supposedly tried it more than once in the past and you refused?", "I was on the fence until I got to FUCKING 75,000 DOLLARS.\n\nNTA I would have a panic attack over losing that much potential income", "To be fair the snakes are probably the least dangerous thing in that room, including the toddlers. Rat snakes and pythons are pretty harmless.", "funny of you to assume they are allowed anywhere on the property ever again after causing 75K in damages. if someone caused 200 dollars worth of damage in that manner of negligence, they would never be allowed over again.", "That David played, and it pleased the Lord", "I'm grateful that the husband is on your side and making payments, even though it should be solely her responsibility for being so idiotic. I can't even begin to understand how she thought that was a good idea. God forbid if any of her children put their hands into the enclosures and get bitten or got a nasty electric shock from the wires they were messing around with.", "You don\u2019t punish 2, 3, and 5 year olds for doing something like this. They had no idea what they were doing and they were there with their mom and under her \"supervision\". She is absolutely to blame for this. At the most he could explain to the 5yo that they accidentally damaged some things belonging to OP by playing with the power supply and not to touch other people's stuff without the owner's permission.", "At 3 and 5? Not really a point now it's days later. Kids that age struggle to make connections between past behaviour and punishment unless it's immediate. The wife is responsible here.", "Got a 3yr old. He has a chair in the living room he likes to stand on the arm rests. I have to tell him every time no and I will physically remove him from the chair. It's a toddler sized spiderman chair. Low to the ground but not low enough he wouldn't not break his arm, leg or seriously injure his neck/spine. \n\nThey are legit puppies in that sense.
