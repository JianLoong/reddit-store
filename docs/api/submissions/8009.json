Lexi and I have a fairly close relationship and I often take her places.\n\nI have a girlfriend Holly (f27). We've been in a long distance relationship for 3 years, as Holly lives on the other side of the country. 2 months ago, Holly has moved in with me and we couldn't be happier. It was a big change for Holly and homesickness hits her sometimes but we're excited to finally build a life together.\n\nEver since Holly has moved in with me and we've been spending time together, Lexi has been jealous of her. I still make time for Lexi and usually see her every other weekend.\n\nI think my sister, Beth (f30), is encouraging Lexi's jealousy and making it worse. Whenever I meet up with them or invite them over, Beth will make passive aggressive comments like \"I thought you forgot about us!\" or \"you must never have time for Lexi anymore\" and pass it off as a joke and laugh.\n\nLexi has been acting really weird around Holly and last weekend when we all met up to grab some dinner, Lexi was making rude, passive-aggressive comments towards Holly the whole time and passing them off as jokes. Implying that no one in the family likes her, she's ugly, stupid, etc. Beth was laughing and smiling at Lexi whenever she said these things.\n\nAfter the dinner I spoke to Lexi in private and told her that her behaviour is out of line and that she needs to apologise to Holly. I told her that she's allowed to not like Holly, not everyone likes everyone, but she still has to be nice to her, and that the things she said were hurtful and not okay. \n\nLexi started crying and accused me of replacing her. I told her I still love her and that she'll always be my niece and part of the family but Holly is also important to me. Lexi kind of shut down and stopped listening to anything I was saying and went to go find Beth. She was wailing and told Beth that I've been lecturing her and \"forcing\" her to like Holly, and said that I'm abandoning her.\n\nBeth was comforting Lexi, and I asked Beth if we could talk about this privately in a few minutes. \n\nThen Beth told me I'm being a horrible aunt to Lexi and that kids don't like change and that I need to understand that. She said I need to be more compassionate to my niece. I told her that I'm not doing anything wrong by spending time with my partner and expecting her to be respected. Beth told me I'm missing the point and that Lexi is just acting her age and I need to have a more loving approach. \n\nI told Beth that she's teaching her daughter that being emotionally manipulative will get what she wants and that I'm not going to take part. Beth went off about how I'm being cold-hearted and that I'm blowing everything out of proportion and alienating Lexi.\n\nEverything hasn't been quite the same since that incident and I'm left feeling confused and all kinds of mixed feelings but ultimately I think I was right.

You are well within your rights to expect Lexi to treat your girlfriend with respect. Beth isn\u2019t just teaching her daughter to be emotionally manipulative\u2014she\u2019s also teaching her to be rude and entitled when she doesn\u2019t get her way. The way they\u2019re behaving all but guarantees you\u2019ll see *less* of Lexi, not *more*. It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy that Beth will inevitably blame *you* for. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation, but not one you\u2019re responsible for.", "Honestly, if anyone insulted my partner at dinner by implying/\u2018joking\u2019 that no one likes her, she\u2019s ugly, etc\u2026it would have been game on right at the table.\n\nNTA at all. Your niece and sis are the massive assholes. You deserve to be happy with your partner, and it should be a thing where your whole family is growing, not being exclusionary and jealous. If Lexi was patient with your honeymoon period, she\u2019d see she now has two aunts instead of just one. \n\nBut the way she\u2019s going? Shes going to get the opposite outcome than she desires. She\u2019s way too old to be pulling this shit. She sounds like she could be 8, not 3 years from being an adult.", "Definitely NTA. That is not okay behavior and it sounds like Beth is not only encouraging it but actively stoking the flames.\n\nIs Beth upset you aren't taking Lexi off her hands as much as you used to? Is she not supportive of your relationship? I don't know why your sister is being like this but she's not a passive player. It sounds like she's also not good at dealing with change and is also lashing out.", "NTA.  (1) Lexi\u2019s behavior is not okay and not a healthy or constructive way to express her feelings.  (2) Beth\u2019s behavior is not okay and she goads Lexi\u2019s behavior and gives the impression that this behavior is somehow acceptable.  (3) It sounds like they both take issue with anything in your life that they perceive as taking attention away from them. \n\nLexi could probably use some guidance in navigating her feelings, but I agree you don\u2019t want to reward her behavior.  \n\nCongrats on starting this new chapter with Holly!", "NTA. Your niece is fifteen, not five. She's old enough to understand the difference between a partner and a niece, and old enough to understand when somebody has less time for her. You set the very reasonable expectation that she not be rude to Holly, when Holly wasn't being rude. You're doing your niece a favor by teaching her boundaries now, because she's bound to have problems in both platonic and romantic relationships if she doesn't learn to sort her emotions, sense boundaries, control herself, and respect other's relationships. Your sister coming to you acting like it's normal for a niece to be upset her aunt is dating somebody is her doing exactly what you said - teaching Lexi to be manipulative. Lexi should be happy for you, and learn how to respectfully ask for more of your attention instead of lashing out at your partner.\n\n\nETA - Missed an entire sentence.", "NTA. As someone who had all of my aunts get married and find their partner up until I was 12. I loved all the weddings and meeting the new partners (except one who is not really nice and also is antisemitic, I\u2019m Jewish). It was like getting a second aunt and another person I could hang out with and feel like was family. \n\nI get 15 year olds are going to have their own feelings. But this is absolutely strange. She is actively lying and misrepresenting and being malicious to your partner and by extension you. This reeks of a kid heading what their parent says at home and feeling like they have the go ahead to behave poorly. \n\nThis is absolute malarkey. You cannot allow for your sister to manipulate you into only focusing on her and her daughter. And you can\u2019t have your niece actively antagonizing your partner. As much as it may suck you might need to pull back some more and set some harder boundaries.", "NTA. This is not normal behaviour. It sounds like your sister has something against your partner/relationship for whatever reason that may be, and is trying to weaponise her daughter.", "NTA.\n\nManipulators are well aware of their antics. Both Beth and Lexi are deliberately misinterpreting it to make it look like you are the one at fault here.", "NTA - is your sister single/divorced? Sounds like she's jealous that you have a supportive partner and are no longer playing spinster sister with her. She enjoyed feeling like you were dedicating your life to supporting her and her daughter. Now that your relationship with your GF is becoming more serious, she's threatened and jealous AF, and she's using her daughter as an emotional weapon. It is terribly manipulative, but I would focus on HER behavior and not your niece's behavior.", ">she was wailing and told Beth that I've been lecturing her and \"forcing\" her to like Holly, and said that I'm abandoning her.\n\nNTA, she lied, fuck this shit. Also NTA if you call her out on it openly.", "I was inclined to think N A H, because I can understand Lexi having complex feelings here. However, the passive-aggressive comments from Beth here push me to NTA. That\u2019s not a healthy way to process your feelings.", "NTA\n\nTotally understandable for Lexi to have her feelings - she is still a child after all.\n\nINFO: Has Lexi had any instances when \u201cabandonment\u201d has actually happened? I wonder if any past relationships are affected her feelings here. (Also, has your sister dealt with any abandonment?)\n\nThe relationship dynamics here seem to be a bit skewed for Lexi - and it seems with no help from Beth. Your niece is your niece. Your partner is your partner. Have you been able to have the conversation about how each relationship is super important, but serve different needs for everyone involved?\n\nGood Luck! (And congratulations on this stage of your relationship)", "NTA. \n\nSounds like it is time for a time out with your sister and niece. Make them aware that if they try and force you to choose between them and Holly, they mighty not like the choice you make.  \n\nPlease do not cave on this and disrespect your partner who upended her life and made big changes to be with you.", "NTA - Lexi is not acting her age. She\u2019s acting somewhat less than half her age and even then, she\u2019s acting entitled and badly-raised, and you\u2019re right: your sister is encouraging this.\n\nBy 15, assuming she has typical development and is hitting the usual milestones, she should be finding her own social life/partners, and whilst she might enjoy spending time with you it\u2019s not placing an expectation on you as a babysitter/carer/entertainer, and she should be starting to transition to a more equal, adult relationship with you.\n\nAt that age I spent nearly every weekend with my aunt, but about half that time was spent looking after my cousins so that my aunt and uncle could socialise - I certainly didn\u2019t expect entertainment to be provided (beyond maybe renting a video for me to watch while they were out) or for them to be constantly and exclusively available to meet my demands.\n\nWith my own nieces and nephews, the teen/older ones know that my door is open to them as long as they call ahead to let me know if they want to visit, but they also understand that whilst I will be glad to see them and will make time to listen to their troubles etc, I will not be dropping everything to accommodate them with more than just a space to be away from their parents/friends at short notice. With the younger ones I don\u2019t get to see/talk to them as much because we live far away, but they all, even the 4-year-old, know that my time is not exclusively theirs and that they have to share with siblings, their parents, and my parents for my attention while I\u2019m around - and every single one of them is okay with that and they\u2019re happy to see me when I\u2019m there and quite accepting when I\u2019m not. At most, if one of them asks my sister will set up a video chat; but even then if I\u2019m unavailable they understand they have to wait.\n\nIt sounds like your sister has not really prepared your niece for any of the adults in her life having significant others who need to be respected and accommodated; but even so she has been very rude to your partner and you\u2019ve been more than generous with your patience over this - it\u2019s quite acceptable here to make respectful behaviour a condition of spending time with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why is your sister so jealous of your relationship?", "\"She was wailing\"\n\n\"Beth told me... Lexi is acting her age\"\n\nHardly.\n\nBeth is raising her daughter to handle her emotions as a child. Lexi misses you and wishes she still saw you all the time, nothing wrong with that. But the fact that Beth approves of how Lexi expresses hostility towards Holly shows that her mother also has the maturity of a child. Tell Holly that you expect better from her as a parent, and you will continue to have expectations of better behavior from Lexi, and your love for Lexi won't change that. Loving parents address bad behavior all the time. NTA", "NTA\n\nFirst things first. A joke is something that makes everyone in the room laugh. If no one laughs it's not a joke. We need to stop trying to sugarcoat insults as 'jokes'.\n\nLexi and Beth are  both manipulating you. You are building a relationship with your partner and they don't like it. Lexi acts like you are cheating on her and that is something that Beth enables. Yes she is young, but she wasn't young when she went ahead to insult your partner? \n\nWhy? Where they used to your help? Do they not like that you have a life? That is something that you need to think about it. But it's not cute or fun. Also try to protect your relationship.

She most certainly is not acting her age; most 15 yo know a niece and a gf are very, very different relationships.", "NTA, while your sister and niece do not have to like your partner they do have to respect the relationship and treat her with common courtesy at minimum. For some reason your niece does not seem to grasp the difference between your relationship with her and your partner, and at 15 she definitely knows there are different kinds of likes and loves. More concerning though is that your sister seems to be fanning the flames of this conflict. To get to the root of the issue here your sister is going to be the one to figure out first. From the sounds of it, she may have some issues with your sexuality.", "NTA \n\nLexi is 15 and old enough to know how to behave better.", "Anybody suspect, like I do, that Beth and Lexi have incestuous feelings towards OP?", "NTA.

That's terrible parenting.", "I 100% agree with u/alandracula.\n\nNTA", "Yes, I thought I'd misread and that Lexi was 5 not 15! Absolutely NTA and both your niece and your sister are going the right way to alienate you fully. \n\nI hope you and your partner are very happy living together, and your family can either choose to include themselves in your new life or to remove themselves/drive you away. But if that's the latter, that's THEIR decision and bad behaviour and not yours.", "I'm going to guess that Beth is unhappy that op is no longer being the parent to lexi and she now has to do it.  Beth is definitely the ahole here in trying to force op to do her job for her. She's also raising another ahole by teaching lexi this behavior.", "To your question, no events of abandonment have happened to Lexi that I'm aware of. \n\nAlthough Beth had Lexi very young and the dad broke up with her to get with someone else only a few days after Lexi was born which was extremely shitty and might be the cause of some of these issues. But for Lexi the dad is and always was involved in her life and has her every other week.\n\nI think a conversation about relationship dynamics would be a great idea but at the moment Beth is not speaking to me so I think seeing Lexi is off the table for now but I'll keep it in mind when I next see her.\n\nThank you Reddit stranger!", "This a new breed of spambot?", "I didn\u2019t want to repeat what was already said.  I would have said the same thing.  So, I succinctly stated that and gave my vote.  Why is that spambot-like?", "NTA & I'm sure if Lexi was acting the same way over a new person in Beth's life, she wouldn't be as tolerable to her daughter's embarrassing behavior. Change is inevitable & the way Lexi is acting is that of a young child, not a teenager.", "NTA and I would take several steps back from them both.", "NTA.

It's not okay to treat people that way.", "NTA, bonus guess: Beth is jealous of your good relationship with her daughter and is most likely manipulating her to ruin it.\nJust a hunch.", "NTA\n\nYou handled this about as well as you could have, and if Beth had only supported you then Lexi could have been cajoled into seeing that she hasn't been replaced. Changes can be hard for anyone, but you're handing out all the reassurance you can.", "I had to go read Lexi\u2019s age again, to be sure. 15 is too old to be acting like this. Even 5 is old enough to know what is rude and what is not. If Lexi can\u2019t behave herself, then she does not get the reward of your attention. Nib this in the bud now. Be firm. 15 is way to old to be acting like spoiled brat.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but are you maybe providing less childcare and $$ to support Lexi than you were before Holly so your sister is mad and using her daughter to get at you?", "NTA I would start distancing yourself from both of them until they come out of respect for your partner tell both of them straight up if they can\u2019t respect your partner then you\u2019re gonna stop spending time with them as much but if you guys can respect my partner than nothing would really change", "NTA\n\nBut I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s not teaching, she\u2019s already taught her daughter to try and get what she wants this way.", "Your sister is in the lead for the title of AH frankly.

And unfortunately, you are going to have to make your boundaries clear to both your niece and her mother.  \n\nNTA", "NTA- Lexi is almost old enough to drive therefore she\u2019s perfectly capable of knowing her behavior is impolite and downright rude. Holly is your partner and you absolutely need to defend her and your relationship. I wonder if Beth would say the same thing if you were dating a man?? Beth needs to explain to Lexi that you can\u2019t stay single forever and that this is your SO. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to be jealous. In fact, if she plays her cards right she can be included in having another fun aunt to do things with. But at this rate she will push you away and there will be less time spent with her. Perhaps you need to say this to both Beth and Lexi. Good luck. I think you were right in calling out your sister\u2019s and Lexi\u2019s behavior.", "NTA.\n\nDoes your sister have some kind of abandonment issues or something? Because I totally feel like Lexi just plays out what her mother secretly wants to do. Has she always been possessive/insecure? Did she act like that with other exes too?\n\nI also notice that she was 15 herself when she had Lexi. So Beth might not have had a lot of time to have friends besides you?", "NTA. Even if Lexi was acting her age, the way children learn not to \u201cact their age\u201d is by having their behavior corrected. \n\nYou are setting reasonable and appropriate boundaries, your sister is doing her daughter a disservice.", "I think the sister is the AH and is manipulating the niece, this all smells like sour grapes from the sister.", "I legitimately scrolled back up to make sure I hadn't misread her age! She's not acting her age at all. I'd expect that from my 4yo, not a 15yo.", "Probably because the upvote button already serves that purpose.
