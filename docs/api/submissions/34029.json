You've conveyed reasonable interest in your colleagues well-being, helping the professional requests to not sound too pushy.

For what purpose? Is he sending these messages to other people? Why is his mother so actively involved in her adult sons marriage? Overall it sounds like you need marriage counselling, specifically to work on your jealousy issues because this is not a sustainable relationship. His mother needs to butt out, and it is your husbands responsibility to ensure she does. If mother in-law has made it clear she doesn't like you, then your husband absolutely should not be going to her with marriage issues because he will not receive unbiased advice/opinion etc. Of course she is going to use those instances to create more friction.\n\nYTA to yourself if you don't start establishing healthy boundaries, seek professional marital help asap and let your husband know that there are 2 people in your marriage, and his mother is neither of them.", "YTA\n\nYou're definitely engaging a man who is flirting with you and that makes you an A. You say you're the jealous type and usually that type is the one who trends unfaithful and untrustworthy; they feel heightened sense of anxiety because they believe everyone is as underhanded as they are in exclusive relationships. Your MIL is *always* going to be looking out for her child and helping him assess you, what motivates you, and how you treat him. If you continue \"joking around\" this way with other men, expect to always be the A right at the top of her hate list.", "ESH. Couples Therapy, and if that doesn't work out, part ways. \n\nThis relationship sounds toxic, so I'm assuming you're codependent because why on earth would either of you continually put up with this?", "How old are you both?
