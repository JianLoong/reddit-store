That said, lack of sleep makes everyone crazy, so if you've been dealing with sleep issues for a while and you're both sleep deprived, I'd try to give yourselves both some grace. My husband and I have never fought quite like we did when we were up all night with babies.", "Something I've learned not to tolerate is name calling or abusive language from my partners. If you let them get away with it once, even if it's just said in a moment of intense emotion, it creates an environment where they more readily do it again. It's the same thing as when we were children. If our parents didn't set and hold strong on rules and boundaries, we could become little monsters over time. \n\nMy husband said something to me once while we were working on hanging pictures...I believe it was in reaction to a question I asked and he told me to \"f***ing use your brain.\" I walked away from him and left him to hang the rest. Later he apologized and I told him that I never talked to him like that so he won't do any different with me. He hasn't done it since. What he said was hurtful. \n\nDon't let it eat at you or hurt your relationship. Give you both time to cool down and approach him again about why it was not okay to say that to you. Give and inch and people will take a mile. \n\nNTA", "Your one fault? Letting him take the bed instead of vice versa. NTA.", "NTA. Next time make him sleep somewhere else. He is the one that ruined the night. He should be very apologetic. Words like that are inappropriate to say to your partner....but he said them after you accidentally dropped your phone? Pretty wild reaction....to something you accidentally did. I would keep this in mind and if this is a pattern, start seeing a counselor together.", "I cannot stress enough how accurate this is. A man calling a woman a bitch is loaded and he knows it\u2014 that\u2019s why he used it as he did. The circumstances under which he called you a bitch are not in any capacity reasonable. Don\u2019t let him make excuses, and don\u2019t do him any favors making them on his behalf.\n\nI\u2019m all for forgiveness but it\u2019s important you make it clear forgiving him is a one time thing. I really really really wish I stuck to my guns on not tolerating someone saying that to me in the past. Repeated use is a bright red flag. Know what your plan is if he does that again and communicate it to him. OP you are NTA and you\u2019re justified putting your foot down on this.", "It seems very cut and dry to me why she'd be upset over that comment, idk that a conversation is needed to explain.", "OP states they were both tidying up the bedroom.", "Except it's not the first time and he only apologized after making several attempted justifications. He's ta here.", "I agree with this, especially since OP says hubs apologized. After that, she's the one extending the conflict (assuming apology was sincere). What else does she want?", "Don\u2019t blame yourself. Somebody who needs constant policing to not be disrespectful towards you will never be a good partner.", "NOPE. This is not it. He's the one in the wrong. Way to be an apologist for his abuse.", "How was she equally mean? She looked at him and he called her a bitch", "No they were not equally mean. He was mean and she said that's not acceptable. She was not mean at all.", "He didn't give a sincere apology he said sorry fter trying to justify his shit behavior and put the blame on her. Holding the boundary communicates that she isn't interred in being around him when he calls her names and is disrespectful.", "What a gross and unnecessary comment. Congratulations, troll.", "In true emotionally oblivious fashion (best case), he thinks forgiveness means what he did doesn't exist. \n\nI think the best approach going forward is not to offer forgiveness and tell him saying sorry means you understand you aren't owed of forgiveness even if you are asking for it, and you are allowed time to process.\n\nHe's giving me real \"its not a big deal unless it happens to me\" energy too.\n\nNTA.", "An apology is great, *if* it acknowledges the awfulness of the offense. He is telling you to get over it, and that is not an apology. And regardless of all that, it takes time to feel okay again after something like that, and it seems perfectly reasonable to me to not want to sleep beside someone who's just said something so vile to you. NTA", "> He replied that it just slipped out and shouldn\u2019t bother me.\n\nThat\u2019s not for him to decide. It is a mark of disrespect and something that one shouldn\u2019t call their partner.", "If my husband called me then I actually think our relationship would be over. That and the c word are words a man never ever call his partner", "Absolutely not. He is justifying verbal abuse. Saying it shouldn't bother you is not acceptable. Saying it \"slipped out\" is not acceptable. Apologizing only to smooth things over isn't changing anything. He said what he really thinks about you and is trying to make you the problem for not accepting his shitty behavior.", "It's the minimising and 'this shouldn't bother you' that's most  concerning here. \n\nI'll admit that like your husband I said f*** you and f*** off to my spouse earlier in our marriage. But I heard my partner when they expressed how hurtful that was. I apologised, came up with and explained my plan for reacting differently next time I felt I was losing control (walk away when I start losing control of myself), asked for their help to achieve that (please let me walk away to calm down without following me), asked what they needed to make this work better for them (reassurance that I would come back to resolve things and wasn't just stonewalling) and put effort into doing those things next time I felt angry. \n\nEveryone makes mistakes, especially sleep deprived parents. But where is the listening to your needs? Where is the accountability? I think you're right to identify couples therapy as a good next step to address this.", "If he's trying to make you believe that you shouldn't be bothered by the mean names he calls you and poor treatment he displays towards you, he's not really sorry about doing it", "He only apologized after making several attempts at justification. He's not sincere and he's TA here. Her not immediately falling into his arms in gratitude after being hurt by him is not extending the conflict.", "With all the blame he tried to put on her for \"ruining the night\", what's the chance that his apology was sincere?", "No she didnt specify what she said back", "No she didn't specify what she said", "How so? It\u2019s the truth, isn\u2019t it?", ">Parenting in general is hard, and parenting toddlers can be so stressful\n\nEspecially when you have a grown up toddler that you also need to take care of.", "Someone can also apologize even tho they dont mean it", "I disagree, what someone says while tired, stressed, and generally at their worst is not necessarily indicative of there true feelings. While it's no excuse to say these things to loved ones, but not everyone is the great at coping with stress.", "That only allows people to get away with bad behavior. You can love someone and not immediately act like nothing happened when someone is cruel to the other. He's also NOT here for her when the cards are on the table so why should she swaddle him in protection when she's the wounded party?", "I'm just going off what OP said", "She didn't say anything. Just glared back at him when he glared and started the confrontation.", "If he sincerely apologized (key word: sincere), she's the one extending what was a minor conflict. This ALSO assumes he does make a habit of calling her foul names. If he does, the whole situation is different.", "\"I guess i shot some daggers back\"", "That's glaring. He glared at her and said \"are you serious\" and she glared back.", "Oh"]}
