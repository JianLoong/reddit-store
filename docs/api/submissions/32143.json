Selling a home you own and moving is a huge deal - and the two of you aren\u2019t even married yet.

Moving, even if you wanted to, would cost you more than years of 40 minute commutes.\n\nHad a co-worker who moved closer in order to improve the commute. Not that long after, company relocated to a suburb. New house now had a long commute, old house would have worked much better.", "Something I did forget to mention, I brought the fact that she could potentially live with a close friend in that town if her driving this far is a huge deal, but she said how she wouldn\u2019t even want that bc she wants to build a life with me here in this home.", "NTA, absolutely goofy request by her. A paid off house is worth it's weight in gold these days with wild interest rates. Probably locked into some low taxes unless you get reassessed for an addition etc.", "NTA at all. Do NOT sell the house! Especially in this economy. Besides... if your GF wants to live closer to her work.. she should rent an apartment...", "I think she's a little confused... \n\nThis isn't an apartment you rent, and you can't just switch apartments and find one with a similar rental price and size. \n\nThis is a house. It's security (assuming it's paid off or has manageable payments). \n\nNTA. She wants for you to sell your house (which is close to your job) so that her commute would be easier? \n\nThis is the real life version of dropping a house on a fly to swat it.", "Puts her closer to work but you further. You would end up  paying more monthly. Doesn\u2019t make sense to me", "NTA why should you move 40 minutes away from your job so she can be closer to hers?

End of story.    \nNTA", "NTA\n\n40 minutes each way is a very reasonable commute.  \n\nNo, you shouldn't spend thousands of dollars to sell your house, but a new house, and pay higher interest rates because your GF doesn't want to pay her $1300 in car maintenance.\n\nIf your GF doesn't like that, she could always rent her own place closer to work.", "NTA.

Are there any compromises you WOULD be willing to make for you two to continue living together and make her commute easier, or has this relationship run its course?\n\nNAH rn.

A 40 minute commute is nothing in todays society in the u.s.", "NTA. Something isn\u2019t adding up here. 40 minutes each way isn\u2019t a long way to drive, and shouldn\u2019t have done so much damage to her car.\n\nMy Dad and brother both work in the city I live in. Dad\u2019s 40 minutes away, my brother\u2019s closer to an hour away. Dad hasn\u2019t had car trouble because of driving that distance. My brother has had car trouble but he drives for seven hours every other friday and sunday to get his daughter, so that\u2019s more understandable.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s really not that long of a commute and doesn\u2019t justify a move.", "NTA.\n\nYou have no obligation to do that, and why would you?  It doesn't sound like this is a lifelong thing, just saying \"girlfriend\" vs. \"SO\" or something (if you don't want to get married).

I think she got like monthly oil changes, and other scheduled maintenance, and that was with a Prius (which has a range of like 500 miles, so like 20 full tanks is an pop change) \n\nShe could consider something like buying an electric car. Most have a range of like 300 MI, more than enough for the distance. Much less maintenance. Adding a charger to your house improves value. Depending on thr value of your home and mortgage rates, even if you both chipped in on the new car, you'd probably save money overall on the costs VS moving and refinancing.", "Nta", "NTA.
