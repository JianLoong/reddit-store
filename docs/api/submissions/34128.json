I won't get into any detail, but he struggles with being around strangers and by that a mean if he has to talk to the delivery man he will have a panic attack, the only people he's okay being around is family members he knew ever since he was a kid including me and his fiance (26M) but even with that if there's more than 3 of us he'll have a panic attack. This is something my entire family is concerned about and yes, he's getting therapy and help for this, he knows this is a problem and he's dealing with it like a champ. \nOnto the actual story. I got married a few months ago, my family comes from the cacusaus mountains and even though we now live in the us and my husband's family is off different origin my family arranged a huge wedding. It basically went as is during the actual wedding ceremony they'd only be close friends and family members but during the feast/party after the vows All the guests would arrive. We knew my brother wouldn't be able to handle the party part so he'd only he attending the more secluded Wedding ceremony. \nMy brother was ecstatic for my wedding and thought he'd be able to attend the ceremony since he had been doing great in therapy. But a few hours before the wedding my brothers fiance called me saying my brother was extremely nervous and probably if he even set foot in that wedding ceremony he'd have a panic attack, he basically asked me something along the lines off \"is it okay if he's high during the wedding?\" (My brother has a medical card for marijuana for stuff like this). Though I was upset I knew it wasn't my brothers fault so I said aslong as he didn't smell like weed it would be fine. \nDuring the wedding ceremony he thankfully didn't smell like weed but was very calm and was even able to attend the party. he didn't necessarily seem high either, He didn't really talk to anyone to no one noticed. But this was also his first time meeting my husband and he was ashamed that he literally had to be high to meet his brother in law, so I didn't tell my husband about it, I knew my brother would be ashamed and embarrassing and it wasn't my place to say anything, but my mom did know. A few days ago while we were talking she (my mother) cracked a joke about it Infront of my husband. My husband was confused and my mom straight up told him about my brother being high at my wedding. \n\nAfter my mom left my husband was pissed with me, he didn't mind that my brother was high at all, if that's what he needed to do he didn't mind, he's angry at me because I didn't tell him and that I even though he'd judge my brother in the first place. This is in no way marriage ending before some people's overeact in the comments, he's just been pissed at me.

If your brother wasn\u2019t being disruptive, there was no reason to immediately make note of it.   You maybe could have told your hubby after the fact so he had a little context.

If your husband knows about your brothers issues, which he clearly does, I see no reason why you wouldn\u2019t have told him that he needed to medicate in order to be present.

He wasn't high for recreational use. He was high from a medical need. \n\nIs your brother even okay with your mom cracking jokes? It seems very callous considering how sensitive this topic is for him. \n\nKudos on you and your SIL for helping your brother take steps forward. \n\nBe careful with your husband's reaction spreading too far. If it gets back to your brother that your husband is angry at you over the situation, He's probably going to feel unnecessary guilt and make his next interaction with your husband even more difficult.", "NTA\n\nWould your husband have wanted to know that your brother was on anti-anxiety meds at your wedding if that's what had been prescribed? Or taken headache meds if he was having a headache that day? No? I don't see the difference. It might not be a secret but it isn't something that necessarily needs to be shared.\n\nBut on a random tangent - why had your brother and husband not met before your wedding? That's the odd thing about all this to me."]}
