He wasn't high for recreational use. He was high from a medical need. \n\nIs your brother even okay with your mom cracking jokes? It seems very callous considering how sensitive this topic is for him. \n\nKudos on you and your SIL for helping your brother take steps forward. \n\nBe careful with your husband's reaction spreading too far.

It\u2019s understandable that your husband feels hurt because he thinks you didn\u2019t trust him, but you were right not to make a thing of it and talking about it. It was private.\n\nYour mom joking about it was a mildly asshole move though.", "I don\u2019t get the Not TA. I\u2019m not sure who would be the AH then. \n\nNAH.

It's fair he's annoyed because he thinks you assumed he would judge your brother. However you need to make clear to your husband you didn't tell your husband at your brother's request. Your brother was ashamed and asked you not to parade the information. This isn't a matter of lack of marital trust. Sometimes your brother will share things with you that if they don't concern your marriage, you won't tell him. Being your husband doesn't mean you're going to break your families or friends confidential information if it doesn't involve him.", "You probably should try to explain that you were respecting your brother\u2019s privacy.

Your brother basically used medication to help him get through the wedding . If he\u2019d needed a Xanax would your husband still feel entitled to knowing that he had to take one ?", "NAH\n\nThere is still a HUGE stigma around the use of marijuana, and even those who you think might be comfortable with someone\u2019s use, even medically, can suddenly show/tell you they are not ok with it.\n\nCouple that with the stigma on mental health, and a double whammy for men, as society expects them to always be \u201cstrong and unemotional\u201d which needs to be addressed, but not here.\n\nI can fully understand your reluctance to not share your brother\u2019s health concerns nor his use of cannabis, even though he uses medical grade.\n\nWhat I am worried about, and this isn\u2019t on you, but something you do need to think about, are two things:\n\n1. That your mother was joking about your brother\u2019s mental health in such a nonchalant way that she informed your husband about your brother\u2019s medical use of cannabis.\n\nWhy was your mother discussing this so openly? Have you discussed your brother\u2019s medical history before? Does she often discuss without him being around?\n\n\n2. Your husband and his over reaction. I personally feel he is over reacting to this. \nWould he react the same way had your brother been taking pills for anxiety? \n\nI would suggest a good heart to heart conversation with him, listen and hear each other. He shouldn\u2019t be offended that you chose to not disclose another person\u2019s medical history. Would he be ok if you did the same with regard to him? Is he the type to discuss someone\u2019s mental health with others?\n\n***Is this a possible reason as to why your brother did not meet him prior to the wedding?

Did he need to know every person who was high, taking insulin, high BP meds? It wasn't your business to share.

Your brother really wanted to attend your wedding and be there for you, he did what needed to be done for the same. He is your brother and you guys have certain secrets that nobody else needs to know. You owe it to your brother to keep his secrets private be it about this particular case Or any other situation. Unless you have been given a green card from someone to share their private affairs with people you would be in the wrong to do so, be it your husband or a friend or anyone else for that matter. Had the situation been reversed and it was your husband in place of your brother would he want you to go out and tell your family about it without his permission? Your husband needs to understand that his relationship with you might be the most important one to you two, but irrespective of that you have bonds and relationships with your friends and family and you can have a boundary regarding those relationships with him. It seems weird to me that he wants to know everything you know about everyone.", "Your mom is an AH and cannot be trusted with any information you want to keep private.  Keep this in mind.

Your brother got to enjoy a social activity without panic attacks. You suck for being more concerned about the smell than his well being.\n\nAlso, 90% of the time when someone has a panic disorder like this it's caused by family members. No wonder he's anxious, being a grown adult asking permission to take medicine.", "Yes, YTA. Your husband is an adult and can process complex information. This is the person you married and are supposed to trust enough to spend your life with. If I felt like I couldn't trust my husband with something like this I would not have got married.

You made a mountain out of this absolute nothingburger.", "Tf is it his business", "I completely understand how your brother would feel and I get why you didn\u2019t say anything at the time, and I also get why you probably didn\u2019t think to mention it after.

I\u2019m going with NAH but it\u2019s a perfect example of a failure to communicate. I think both you and your brother have found wonderful men to do life with. All you can do is apologise and do better next time.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s none of your husbands business what medications your brother is on and you didn\u2019t say anything out of respect to your brother.

That you were worried about his reaction (like the one he is having now), so you didn\u2019t ruin either of your special day?!\n\nNo it\u2019s not marriage ending, but it is emotional manipulation and a red flag. It\u2019s a really silly thing for him to be pissed over", "Soft YTA. Marriages thrive on good communication. And if you're keeping things from your new husband because you think he might not like them, he's justifiably pissed. Try to keep telling him the stuff he may not like. There will always be things like this, and you both need to be ok with a certain amount of disagreement and conflict in your relationship. I speak from the perspective of a 15 year relationship here.", "This did not affect anyone but your brother.   It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s business. Your husband is being ridiculous.  Intrusive and rude to insist he needs to know this.", "NTA however I understand a little your husband, I'll be annoyed if my partner assumed that I would be judgemental about smoking weed to feel more confortable in a social gathering. But pissed and resentful that long ? I think it's a bit overexagerated.", "Luckily your brother did not cause a scene but imagine what would've happened if he did cause a scene while high.

He was having problems with his condition and used his medication. It solved the problem he was having with no negative effects. No one else needs to know about it, it's his personal business.\n\nI can slightly understand your husband's reaction if you said anything that made it sound like you were worried about him being judgmental. If you didn't and he is assuming that despite you saying about your brother not wanting people to know, then he might be being, not an A hole, but a bit of an asshat.\n\nI would just like to add this. \n\nI suffer from a lot of mental health issues and know how hard it can be to do things, even things you really want to do. I'm proud of your brother for doing what he needed to do and getting through something so important but so stressful. I wish him all the best and hope he can get himself into a more comfortable place.", "NAH.  Your brother wasnt high, he was medicated for anxiety.  Weird you hid it from your husband (but not so weird as to make you an asshole)", "It\u2019s not your place to tell anyone if your brother doesn\u2019t feel comfortable. Your brother was able to have a good time at your wedding while staying relaxed, which is amazing. Your husband is making this about himself.", "You didn't tell husband because you thought your brother would be embarrassed. Fine for husband to feel upset you didn't trust him but equally fine that you chose to protect your brother. Your brother sounds like he's been unwell a long time so it's only natural to want to keep him safe, also - as others have said - it's technically private medical info. Going forwards I probably would reassure your brother that your husband can be kept in the loop.\n\nNAH. Though your mum is a mild AH, unless she thought your husband already knew?", "NTA. Being under the influence of alcohol is much more dangerous, would show the petty side of many people and personalities, is the major reason for many fights, deaths, rapes and harassing.

Lots of people are high everywhere all the time. It's not hurting anyone.", "YTA being married is about sharing - even the uncomfortable stuff. Your husband should have been told.", "NTA, he took it for legitimate medical reasons so its no different than medicine", "NTA. \n\nYour brother was medicated to control his condition. Like blood pressure or diabetes,  if his body isn't capable of functioning correctly without medicine,  he should take it.\n\nYou honestly didn't need to be informed,  and certainly this isn't information that anyone should consider their business besides brother.", "NTA, i know what it's like to have such severe anxiety and you're being a good sister. it seems like you didn't tell him to save your brother some dignity since you said he'd be embarrassed about it, not because you'd think your husband would be judgemental. i'd just tell ur husband that.\n\nbut also is your brother okay with your mom joking about his medical needs? cause if not.... :/\n\nit's also just not anyone's business but your brother's because it's his medication and he wasn't being disruptive. he's entitled to privacy.", "NTA. It's a tricky situation. Maybe in an ideal world, introducing your brother to your husband before the wedding would have been great. But life's not always that neat, especially when dealing with mental health. You were juggling a lot \u2013 your wedding, your brother's challenges, and family dynamics. It's clear you care about your brother and were trying to make the day as smooth as possible for everyone.\r  \n\r  \nNot telling your husband about the situation at the time might not have been perfect, but it sounds like you were trying to protect your brother from feeling more stressed or embarrassed. You weren't hiding something malicious; you were just stuck in a hard spot.

Hopefully, he'll see where you were coming from and understand your intentions were good.", "NTA, the whole thing seems a bit strange, why do you need to discuss any of your family's medication use prior to your wedding with your husband?", "Is it really that big of a deal ? ESP if he has a card saying he can use for medical reasons \u2026.. you didn\u2019t need to tell anyone his business\u2026 idk why hubby is pissed.

I hope he gets it.", "NTA - Your brother was using marijuana for medical reasons (anxiety). He wasn't causing any drama. Your husband really does need to chill out.", "NTA.  Marriage may be about sharing, but that's for your business - not other people's.", "Maybe it's just cuz I live in a legal state and worked at a dispensary but this whole post seems so ridiculous lol when I first read the title I thought he was doing hard drugs. The way people treat weed is so weird , the next time your husband picks up a drink ask him if you should let your brother know cuz why shouldn't go both ways.", "NTA. I don't understand why your husband thinks that's information he should have been privy to. It's really not any of his business. Telling him at the time would have just made an awkward interaction between them more likely and that could have been a setback for your brother. Telling him after the fact would have been mostly harmless except it's generally considered rude to disclose other people's medication needs without their consent, and again why does your husband feel like that's something you are obligated to share with him?", "NTA.
