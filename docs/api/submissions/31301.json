Silently.  There is no instruction in scripture to ask nonbelievers to pray before meals.", "NTA\n\nI'd be bloody annoyed if someone insisted I prayed in my own home +I'd be a bit annoyed if they insisted on doing it out loud it themselves tbh)And it wouldn't be an honest prayer, so what's the point. \n\nYou might have reacted better however.", "NTA just a good exemple of religion trying to force you to live their way.", "please god, get these ppl the f out of my home", "NTA", "NTA. In Japan we say Itadakimasu, which means (rough translation) I humbly receive this food.  The Buddhists take it a bit further spiritually to also mean thank you to the food and grains for giving their life to nourish you. I've found that even my very atheistic friends get behind that one as you aren't worshiping a god you are giving thanks to the host and food. But you are NTA. Your home, your palace, your prayer rules. If they insisted they could have just as easily done so silently. If their God can't hear their intentions that isn't much of a god is it?", "NTA: she's very welcome to pray but she Knows you guys don't (I'll assuming that even though she's been away 4 years, she did used to be around you all regularly).  To come into your house and expect everyone to honor her new thing by participating, especially without warning, is pretty ludicrous.\n\nNo need to be offensive back though if you were. Just stare its not its not your thing.", "Nta. My family is agnostic as well but my dads parents aren\u2019t.

Zeus, Odin, Jahweh, the sun, Seth, Ra, Allah, Johan Cruijff, Satan,  Altjira, Ba'al? And why to him/her? Do the others don't deserve a proper praying? \n\nCome on. NTA\n\nPeople who come to my house can say their prayer in silence. I will wait till they are ready. But I will not pray with them. That is a simple boundary, they can pray, I will not.", "NTA- it\u2019s my belief you should always follow suit with whatever the host does.", "NTA. I will let people pray in my home, if they ask nicely. However I won't participate. If they insist that others join them they are not invited back.", "nta. say \u201ci am an atheist, i do not pray.\u201d", "NTA. I\u2019ve never understood why believers care if the rest of us believe. I\u2019m not praying because it\u2019s a waste of time.", "INFO.  How did your mother handle the request for a prayer?", "NTA. Praying is extremely personal. No one's business if you pray before a meal or not.", "I am always respectful of this at other people's houses but no, I'm not Christian and won't be told to in my own house. \n\nNTS", "NTA- she could have also just respected your beliefs instead of trying to have your parents force you to accommodate hers.", "Nta\n\nShe is a socially accepted cultist", "INFO: what did your mother do?\n\nIf she also wasn\u2019t ready to eat you should have sat respectfully.

I'm an atheist and also my parents but others family member and friends do belive in differents religions and usualy before eating. I just keep silence while they pray as my parents teach me to do.
