My family wasn't happy about it. They were mad at me and concerned. They wanted me to \"get rid of it\" but I refused. Derek was nothing but supportive but my family hated him. \n\nI moved in with Derek for many reasons. My family was very against that and wouldn't stop talking about how bad an idea it was and how much better it would be to stay with them that I blocked them for a while. \n\nI ended up inviting them to the baby shower and making nice. It started normal and nice, they even insisted on doing some things for me to help. It changed to seem weird when they said they can just keep the gifts over at their places for when the baby is over there. That seemed weird to me but I let them take them as they were the ones who bought it. \n\nMy family continued to be very nice and helpful. One day I went over to my brother's (Jeff 26m) house for his birthday. The whole house was baby proofed and had a fully furnished nursery in it. Note that he does not have kids and in the months since there has been no indicator that he's expecting one. \n\nI thought that was really weird so I asked about it. He said that he just wanted things to be ready so that he can help out with the baby and that things are good for when the baby is over there. The rest of my family said that they all baby proofed their houses too. (By all I mean my parents and my sister Hillary (27f). \n\nI thought that was really weird but tried to put it out of my mind. Soon, they were asking about the names and I said that Derek and I were going to name her Mira. They said they weren't sure that was a good fit and started suggesting a couple names and I said I wasn't interested in their opinions or suggestions. I was ignored and Jeff said he thinks Bambi would be a nice name. I said that her name is and will be Mira. \n\nSince then, my family has called the baby Bambi and not Mira. I thought this was weird and disrespectful so I stopped communication with them. \n\nI gave birth to Mira a couple months ago and didn't tell my family. I've got lots of messages from people saying my family has been wondering when will meet her and why they haven't seen her yet. I've had to correct some people on her name as they said \"Bambi.\" I've said they are not going to. I've seen online that my family is angry about it but I don't want them around as they were so weird about it. \n\nAlso, I am now engaged to Derek in case you find that relevant.

Anyway, NTA but my bet is they\u2019re planning on kidnapping that baby or pulling a fast one. Has bros wife had infertility issues? According to lots of AITA stories attempted family kidnappings happen all the time. I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to make up stuff about you to get CPS involved to forcibly take the baby and give it to your brother. I say keep NC for a long time. Maybe til the kids in college. Don\u2019t ever let them spend time with her alone for sure.", "Your 26 yo bro put a nursery in his house to help you out? I find that hard to believe.", "NTA, your family is just waving armfuls of red flags. Absolutely no reason your brother would need a fully furnished nursery in his house to \"help out\". If I could bet money, I'd put a million on their intention is to take this baby away from you. \n\nReminds me of a comment I read on here awhile ago, young single teen mother, family isn't supportive at all in the beginning and further into the pregnancy they get way way excited. Lot of the same overstepping weird behavior. Except that OP ignored the behavior and allowed them to see baby. They overstepped big time but she sucked it up cuz \"fammmilllyyy\" they convinced her to go out of town for a event and leave baby with them over the weekend. She left and they completely ghosted her. Wouldn't answer phones. Next day she drove back early but they refused to answer the door or give her the baby back. they went to the cops as soon as she left and reported child abandonment and filed for emergency custody and told the cops a bunch of lies. I'm not sure how, but apparently she didn't get full custody back for 3 years.\n\nThese things do happen and they can be absolutely brutal. You're family is showing you who they are and that they can't be trusted. Please trust your gut.", "NTA - Very strange behavior by your family. Almost seems they were looking to adopt the baby away from you.", "NTA. \n\nI wouldn't ever leave them alone with her. Their having a full nursery set up is creepy. Buying a pack and play or whatever, sure sweet and lovely, a whole ass nursery? No. They were either hoping you'd happily foist the baby to them or were hoping you'd struggle then give the bub up. \n\nThem thinking they're entitled to name her is another red flag. \n\nI wouldn't be having contact with them.", "NTA\n\nI find their behavior overall really weird and controlling, also, Bambi is an odd choice for a baby name, and still, it's your baby, you get to make the choice, the fact that you had to correct people on your baby's name is surreal \n\nAlso, they don't get to not support you and then make it as if nothing happened", "The entire family baby proofed their houses and your brother set up a full nursery? That\u2019s a bit much. Either your family is wildly over involved or they were planning on keeping that baby. But why a 26 year old guy want a baby around? And your family even calls her the name he chose? Girl, run.", "How old is Derek?", "You're NTA. I was giving them the benefit of the doubt at first, thinking maybe the baby proofing, nursery, etc. was their way of telling you that if things didn't work out with Derek, you had multiple homes available for you and your baby.\n\nBut what you're describing is horribly controlling and (as you said) weird behavior. It sounds like you're better off without them in your lives right now.", "NTA. You need to be vigilant. On one hand, your family could be plotting something like kidnapping the baby (or you and the baby once you arrive). Or they could be prepping because they fear that when Derek gets 30, he is going to have shown his true controlling or abusive colors and they need to be ready for you and the baby to move in. \n\nNow, a 17/18 year old getting impregnated by a 26/27 year old DOES put a light on why your parents don't like Derek. Either you were under-age or barely legal and a full grown adult decided to pursue and sleep with a youngling...but that is past...\n\nThat your parents refuse to accept the name you chose though...I'm leaning more towards them plotting taking the baby away rather than preparing a soft landing for you and baby when the relationship with Derek turns bad.", "\u2026it sounds like your brother is going to steal your baby.", "Bambi is a weird name for a bay.", "NTA for not wanting your family to meet your baby. You need to act fast on some things. Given that your brother has a full setup + baby proofed house along with the rest of the family baby proofing their homes means they are going to do everything in their power to take that child from you. Since they don\u2019t agree with your relationship with your fianc\u00e9, they are going to spin it as he\u2019s a predator (likely trying to claim he SA\u2019d you by having a relationship with you before age of consent, truth or not) or that you are incapable of properly caring for the child. Getting married and one of you having a stable job will help you immensely, but if you can also get a job (part-time while going to school is fine) it will help show that you are capable of providing for your child. Anticipate anything and everything, no matter how out there it seems. As an example: have your doctor check you over and give you the fullest work up possible to show you are in good health and going so far as to show you are mentally competent. Think of anything and everything no matter how wild it would seem to you and act now to counter it. If you never need it, great. But if you were to end up needing it, better to have it ready and stack everything against your family instead of scrambling to p[lay catch up. Hell, you may want to go to an advocacy group or even CPS itself and ask for advice. State that given recent behaviors from your family (the full nursery set up at your brother\u2019s place without having even checked in with you, them deciding the baby\u2019s name is Bambi and completely ignoring you when you correct them every time) you are concerned they are going to try something, or many things, to try and take your baby away from you and your fiancee. Ask them what are things they recommend you do now to prepare for that possibility. Preparing now for an event will hopefully shorten the time you have to deal with things (days/weeks/months vs. years). If it turns out these plans were unnecessary, account the win. Also, every time they use the named Bambi tell them your daughter isn\u2019t a f\u2019ing deer and definitely not a male one at that. Make it clear you will be teaching her to react to ONLY her name or a nickname SHE chooses by not reacting to Bambi. \u201cGive me Bambi!\u201d *Holding her in your arms* \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cBambi!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no Bambi here, just Mira.\u201d \u201cYou know who I mean.\u201d \u201cNo I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know any Bambi save for a cartoon deer.\u201d", "Okay your title seems misleading since you've said that <<they are not going to.>>\n\nAnd please tell me that Bambi is a fake name...(Mira is great--are either of you Babylon 5 fans--the great Mira Furlan).\n\nAnyway, you are NTA and your family are all creepy(unless Derek is abusive and they are trying to give you an out--but even if he was the Bambi thing is full on cray cray).", "NTA. Anyone that would even remotely think that naming a baby Bambi is okay should never be allowed near a child. You are right that there is something up with what they are pulling. They plan to take the baby. Keep them far, far away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
