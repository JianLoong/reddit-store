It causes her to have difficulty understanding a lot of things. She also can\u2019t talk. Her only form of communication is screaming/crying. She also makes very loud noises when she is happy. I want to make this very clear, no amount of discipline or teaching her will ever help with this.\n\nBut despite all her difficulties, she has fallen in love with all things Disney. Because of this, I decided to take her to Disney. I did my best to prepare for things. I planned the rides she could do around times that would be less busy. I brought toys and activities to distract her through wait times. But things happen.\n\nWe\u2019d had people be rude to us and her all day long, mostly little things. A group of teenage girls pointed, laughed, and even took pictures of my daughter as she did her best to eat her lunch. People rolled their eyes at us and made snide comments as she attempted to carry every stuffed Disney toy she saw.\n\nBut my final straw was when we were waiting in line for the Toy Story Alien ride. She was able to see the ride from where we were in line, so of course she started getting antsy. I did my best to distract her, but I was failing. She couldn\u2019t wait any longer. When the line wasn\u2019t moving, she started to scream in frustration. I picked her up to comfort her but that made things worse. She started screaming louder and thrashing around. People were staring and talking about her under their breath. \u201cShe needs to control her kid.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous. Why bring your kid if they act like that?\u201d Finally someone said, \u201cA swift spanking will fix that.\u201d I\u2019d had enough and snapped that she had brain damage and she couldn\u2019t help it. I got so upset that we just ended up leaving.\n\nAt first I thought they were the AH but after hearing a friend\u2019s opinion, I\u2019m beginning to question myself. They said her screaming is unpleasant and it possibly ruined people\u2019s day. So AITH?\n\nEdit: Thank you all. You\u2019ve made me feel so much better and have given me the courage to return to Disney with my daughter. I just need to stop feeling guilty for us having a place in the world. Also thank you for all your advice!

I will echo the others who suggested talking to Disney about what accomodations can be made if you take her back when she's older. They want you and your daughter to be able to enjoy the parks too, and there are systems in place that can help, such as giving return times for rides so you don't have to physically stand in the line, or the ability to indicate a stroller is being used as a wheelchair so you can bring it through lines so you don't have to get her up until it's time to load among other accomodations.", "NTA", "NTA.

As I said to another person, they basically told me I could only really purchase lightning lane passes for each ride.

I wish I could do more than that. Obviously I didn\u2019t want her to stop having fun, so I chose to continue to wait in line. It was only when people began saying horrible things, like I should beat my child, making me feel uncomfortable that I left. I get it can be frustrating for people to listen to her screaming.

So if you have a time of 11 AM to go on a ride, you could show up anytime between 11 and noon and still get in the lightning lane no problem.", "It's actually the exact opposite, if you are talking about Disney World. They do not give out DAS to those in wheelchairs, because the lines are wheelchair accessible.", "That\u2019s just untrue. Don\u2019t take no for an answer just because someone that day didn\u2019t want to do their jobs. Accommodations are not just for wheelchair-bound people.", "Nope, that\u2019s flat out wrong and I\u2019m so sorry that\u2019s the answer they gave you.  I have a toddler with ASD and possible ADHD who struggles with not moving in lines.  He\u2019s fine waiting, but he has to be on the move.  We have a DAS (Disability Access Service) pass for him.  As he gets older he probably won\u2019t need it, but for now it\u2019s the only way he can enjoy Disney and not have a screaming meltdown in line.\n\nNext time you go (and you should go again, Disney is for everyone and fuck every damn one of those people who made comments), go to Guest Relations in the park and ask for a DAS pass and explain that your child can not wait in line for extended periods due to her extensive brain damage and she does better waiting where she can\u2019t see the ride itself.  A DAS pass will let you \u201cbook\u201d a ride and get a return time equivalent to the current wait time of the ride minus 10 minutes.  When it\u2019s your time (or any time after, they don\u2019t penalize being late and in fact it\u2019s often expected) you go through the Lightening Lane.  That means you get through the line quickly and she can wait her turn somewhere quiet or on another ride with a shorter wait time or playing somewhere.\n\nBut please, please, as an avid park goer with a neurodivergent child and as a former cast member, don\u2019t let this sour you on returning.  Disney World is my child\u2019s happy place, and I imagine your daughter feels similarly.  Disney is for every child, no matter their abilities.  In fact, Disneyland just reopened Toontown with modifications to make it wheelchair/mobility and sensory friendly so no child has to miss out.  Your child should always be able to be her wonderful, beautiful self there.", "For me the moment you realize there's nothing you can do to stop her and choose to stay in the queue is when you start to become an asshole, even if it's a small one. And it depends how much longer the line is.\n\nYou ARE affecting other people around you and that's a balance. I have chronic migraines, if I was stuck in a line with a screaming child for an extended period of time I'd likely have an attack triggered. There may be other children like your daughter who are sensitive to that much noise that can also be triggered.\n\nThat doesn't mean you should beat your child, that advice is out of line. And yes you may not be able to stop her. But at that point you should leave. There are consequences for behavior and even if she doesn't understand them they still exist. Try again later for the ride maybe when the line isn't so bad and find something else to do in the meantime.\n\nAlso next time it may be worth looking into accommodations for your daughter and if she'd qualify for something like shorter wait lines for disability considerations. I know people sometimes judge others for using it but I am 100% pro using those accommodations when appropriate both for your daughter's well-being and those around you!", "I went when I was 3. I think it\u2019s a good age to go there. I was young enough to believe I was meeting the REAL Ninja Turtles but old enough that I can still remember meeting them.

And as I said, if we left the line the only thing that would happen is she would continue to scream until she passed out, effectively ending our day. That did end up happening because of what that person said\u2026after I tried apologizing to the people around us.\n\nAnd as I said in other comments, I did look into accommodations and was told there wasn\u2019t really an option and we had to stay in the regular lines. That\u2019s not my fault.", "Guest Relations can be very particular about giving people DAS passes because people have wildly abused the system in the past.  Unfortunately that means that people who really, genuinely need it don\u2019t realize it\u2019s an option for them.  You basically need to know exactly how to word the request, which is super unfair to first time visitors with needs.\n\nAlso, next time you go try to take advantage of the child care centers if your kiddo gets overwhelmed.  There\u2019s one in every park and they are a nice, quiet place for a toddler to take a breather.  They also have fantastic diaper changing stations there.\n\nIf you are going to Disney World and need some tips on quiet places to unwind, feel free to DM me!  Unfortunately I\u2019m not as familiar with Disneyland, but I\u2019m sure someone on the Disneyland subreddit could give you some great info!\n\nETA because I forgot, yes people can really, truly suck!  I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve had people judge my parenting before when my kid has tried to just lay down in line or got worked up because we weren\u2019t moving or tried to push past to get to the front faster.  But they don\u2019t know my child or his needs.  As a rule I never judge parents who have a kid crying, yelling, or otherwise being loud in Disney because Disney can be overwhelming even for neurotypical adults, much less young kids.  Ignore those people, or make them wildly uncomfortable by asking if they\u2019re always mean to toddlers with brain damage.", "That makes sense. Most of the accessible things we need for my toddler are incredibly hard to find because someone thought it was a parenting hack and made it go viral. Makes sense people would do that for Disney as well.\n\nWe did know about the child care centers! Those came in handy for getting the warm water we needed to flush her meds through her g-tube. But I would appreciate all the tips I could get!\n\nI knew people sucked but I didn\u2019t expect to be met with such hostility from so many people! The only people that were kind were the cast workers. I do my best to help other people I see struggling, but not one person offered help or even a kind word.

A few things, most kids at age 3 don't benefit almost at all from Disney, if anything they spend it pretty miserable, it's hot, loud, tiresome, long lines, etc.  Adding her disability, I probably wouldn't have taken her that young myself. Shoot I wouldn't take a 3 yr old that had no issues at all either though.\n\nIt was possible to plan this trip when she was a tad older, and you both had more time in therapy to address problematic issues that can arise w/her condition and she is a bit better able to regulate emotions, etc.\n\nOf course you have a place in the world, but if I'm honest, yes perhaps their full day wasn't ruined, but could have made it very unpleasant, they also spent hard earned time/money to enjoy their time there. \n\nA few months back, there was a packed flight I took one evening, there was a child that behaved similar to what you describe, but she may have been a tad older, maybe 6 or so...she did similar loud yells the entire 2.5hrs flight.  The lights were dimmed, people tried to sleep, and not even noise cancelling headphones worked, because the screeches were insufferably loud and only about 40-60 sec MAX break between them.\n\nDid it 'ruin' and make everyone's flight incredibly uncomfortable and miserable? Yes.  The parents were likely used to it and probably better equipped to tune out what the rest of the plane couldn't.   When people got ready to deplane, there were mumbles, sighing, and peoples nerves were simply SHOT, they exited like Tigger off that damn plane. \n\nThey could have driven instead, as to not subject 180+ pax to it, but then that was likely a 10 plus hr drive w/a screaming kid in the car so they chose the 'lesser' of two painful events for themselves, and they have every right to do that, but they did it knowing it would likely cause a lot of discomfort to those around them.\n\nIt's just part of life, parents like you have to put up with weird stares/rudeness at you and your child from society in addition to the harshness of dealing with a child with a disability, society may experience very unpleasant noises/stress when around your child.

In the end, by golly you have it harder for sure!  \n\nSome people also have noise sensitivity/anxiety, ptsd, etc... so these situations with a screaming child/baby, etc can exasperate their symptoms, fight/flight kicks in, etc...but that's not YOUR problem either, kwim?", "NTA\n\nAnyone who goes to Disneyland and doesn\u2019t accept and make peace with the fact that they will be around screaming crying children is an asshole.", "Your daughter deserves to be there, or anywhere really, just as much as anyone else.

Sometimes a stranger being silly helps. (And when you explained that she isn't verbal, if I hadn't already figured it out, I would have KEPT talking to her because she's a *human being*. And because I had a nephew with brain damage and no one else that I saw, other than his caregiver and my older kids, ever bothered to treat him like he was a person,  so it's a soft spot for me.) \n\nAnd had anyone said anything to you in my presence, I probably would have come unglued on your behalf.\n\n*hugs momma* you are NTA and your daughter deserves a Disney trip as much as any other kid.", "NTA.

He's also been left with sensory processing issues and too many conflicting noises overwhelms him. Most days, he's pretty ok. But some days, he wakes up freaking out because he doesn't remember who I am, or anything about our 13 years together. He forgets who the kids are too. \n\n His mobility at the time was awful. He could walk, but he swayed and lurched and couldn't go up or down stairs by himself. He also was left with slurred speech. If you've ever heard someone who suffered a stroke, speak, that's almost exactly what he sounded like. \n\nOne day we were uptown together, grocery shopping. He had his earbuds in playing white noise to block out the heavy traffic, school kids shouting, too many noises that would have caused him to panic and get overwhelmed. \n\nHe was walking slightly ahead of me as his therapist advised he practice walking unassisted for small durations. Two women walking beside me started making comments about him. \n\nGiggling and scoffing that he was \"hammered\" at this hour of the morning. False pitying comments about \"what a sad waste it was\" and \"no wonder he has the beer belly.\"\n\nI *LOST* my shit at them. I just saw red. \n\nTold them their comments were disgusting and that he has a brain injury that he is recovering from.\n\nThey just about fell over themselves apologising.

For how much Disney costs, I wouldn't go back until my son is at least 6.

You definitely have a challenging role as the mother of a disabled child but you don't know any of the people around you or their circumstances and you definitely don't seem to care about inconveniencing them.  In the end of the day though you have to ask yourself \"  is it worth it?\" For you and mostly for your daughter because even she didn't manage to enjoy herself. And even if that ride had gone well, what if something else had set her off and made her scream until she passed out? Is this really worth it for her? If you think her distress isn't that bad at the end and she's happy despite it  then I do encourage you to keep trying but if she's struggling with all of this, then just know a peaceful life is also a good life.

Even a toddler without issue will scream and be loud. It's not pleasant to listen to but it is a part of life and if people can't handle a place with noise, tired children and screams - perhaps they should have stayed home instead.

I\u2019ve tried every possible thing to get another outcome but that\u2019s it. So I chose to stay in line for her to scream for 5 more minutes over her screaming for well over an hour on the way out the park and the bus ride to the resort. I ended up having to choose the second option when someone made a nasty comment about spanking her. I tried to apologize and explain.\n\nSo in the end, she passed out when we finally reached the hotel room. Her day was ruined. My day was ruined. And the hundreds of people we passed and sat next to on the bus on the way out were made to feel uncomfortable simply because someone in line couldn\u2019t even be bothered to listen to my apology and explanation.", "I completely understand their irritation. That\u2019s why I tried to take the time to apologize and explain what\u2019s happening. I wasn\u2019t even allowed to finish speaking before this person jumped in and said I should just spank her. By the way, I absolutely care if I am causing someone else harm. You don\u2019t know me, so don\u2019t assume you know how I think and feel. And I do think it was worth it because she was happy the other 99% of the trip. She doesn\u2019t get to experience many things that make her happy. Disney is her one true love and I wanted her to have some fun. She spends so much of her time in stressful hospital environments where she undergoes daily therapies. Her life will never be peaceful.

I think you caused her more stress and frustration than joy by taking her there than just having a normal routine at home watching Disney. Really, is she even going to remember going to Disneyland a week from now?", "You really shouldn't let her do that. That's how most illnesses can spread. Just imagine if the toy she picked and put up to her face was touched by 150 dirty hands just that day.", "Understanding and compassion does go both way.

We went in December and it was actually really nice. They have amazing baby centers and it made the day quite easy. It\u2019s definitely not for everyone and more for us as parents memory but it was nice. It\u2019s definitely the type of day where you drop expectations though. We aren\u2019t really the rollercoaster type (big ones) so we enjoyed doing the all height rides, watching him interact with characters and walking around as a family. It isn\u2019t a cost friendly vacation for most people though and I understand why a lot of families would rather go when they are kids can remember it.", "Grosssssssss.

They are loud. Yes, it can be irritating. The appropriate reaction to a toddler having a meltdown or being overly loud in public is to ignore it as best you can or remove yourself if you really can\u2019t tolerate it, not to give an already stressed parent shit because their kid is behaving like, you know, a child.
