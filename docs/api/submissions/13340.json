It causes her to have difficulty understanding a lot of things. She also can\u2019t talk. Her only form of communication is screaming/crying. She also makes very loud noises when she is happy. I want to make this very clear, no amount of discipline or teaching her will ever help with this.\n\nBut despite all her difficulties, she has fallen in love with all things Disney. Because of this, I decided to take her to Disney. I did my best to prepare for things. I planned the rides she could do around times that would be less busy. I brought toys and activities to distract her through wait times. But things happen.\n\nWe\u2019d had people be rude to us and her all day long, mostly little things. A group of teenage girls pointed, laughed, and even took pictures of my daughter as she did her best to eat her lunch. People rolled their eyes at us and made snide comments as she attempted to carry every stuffed Disney toy she saw.\n\nBut my final straw was when we were waiting in line for the Toy Story Alien ride. She was able to see the ride from where we were in line, so of course she started getting antsy. I did my best to distract her, but I was failing. She couldn\u2019t wait any longer. When the line wasn\u2019t moving, she started to scream in frustration. I picked her up to comfort her but that made things worse. She started screaming louder and thrashing around. People were staring and talking about her under their breath. \u201cShe needs to control her kid.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous. Why bring your kid if they act like that?\u201d Finally someone said, \u201cA swift spanking will fix that.\u201d I\u2019d had enough and snapped that she had brain damage and she couldn\u2019t help it. I got so upset that we just ended up leaving.\n\nAt first I thought they were the AH but after hearing a friend\u2019s opinion, I\u2019m beginning to question myself. They said her screaming is unpleasant and it possibly ruined people\u2019s day. So AITH?\n\nEdit: Thank you all. You\u2019ve made me feel so much better and have given me the courage to return to Disney with my daughter. I just need to stop feeling guilty for us having a place in the world. Also thank you for all your advice!

I will echo the others who suggested talking to Disney about what accomodations can be made if you take her back when she's older. They want you and your daughter to be able to enjoy the parks too, and there are systems in place that can help, such as giving return times for rides so you don't have to physically stand in the line, or the ability to indicate a stroller is being used as a wheelchair so you can bring it through lines so you don't have to get her up until it's time to load among other accomodations.", "NTA", "NTA.

I wish I could do more than that. Obviously I didn\u2019t want her to stop having fun, so I chose to continue to wait in line. It was only when people began saying horrible things, like I should beat my child, making me feel uncomfortable that I left. I get it can be frustrating for people to listen to her screaming.

So if you have a time of 11 AM to go on a ride, you could show up anytime between 11 and noon and still get in the lightning lane no problem.", "It's actually the exact opposite, if you are talking about Disney World. They do not give out DAS to those in wheelchairs, because the lines are wheelchair accessible.", "That\u2019s just untrue. Don\u2019t take no for an answer just because someone that day didn\u2019t want to do their jobs. Accommodations are not just for wheelchair-bound people.", "Nope, that\u2019s flat out wrong and I\u2019m so sorry that\u2019s the answer they gave you.  I have a toddler with ASD and possible ADHD who struggles with not moving in lines.  He\u2019s fine waiting, but he has to be on the move.  We have a DAS (Disability Access Service) pass for him.  As he gets older he probably won\u2019t need it, but for now it\u2019s the only way he can enjoy Disney and not have a screaming meltdown in line.\n\nNext time you go (and you should go again, Disney is for everyone and fuck every damn one of those people who made comments), go to Guest Relations in the park and ask for a DAS pass and explain that your child can not wait in line for extended periods due to her extensive brain damage and she does better waiting where she can\u2019t see the ride itself.  A DAS pass will let you \u201cbook\u201d a ride and get a return time equivalent to the current wait time of the ride minus 10 minutes.  When it\u2019s your time (or any time after, they don\u2019t penalize being late and in fact it\u2019s often expected) you go through the Lightening Lane.  That means you get through the line quickly and she can wait her turn somewhere quiet or on another ride with a shorter wait time or playing somewhere.\n\nBut please, please, as an avid park goer with a neurodivergent child and as a former cast member, don\u2019t let this sour you on returning.  Disney World is my child\u2019s happy place, and I imagine your daughter feels similarly.  Disney is for every child, no matter their abilities.  In fact, Disneyland just reopened Toontown with modifications to make it wheelchair/mobility and sensory friendly so no child has to miss out.  Your child should always be able to be her wonderful, beautiful self there.", "For me the moment you realize there's nothing you can do to stop her and choose to stay in the queue is when you start to become an asshole, even if it's a small one. And it depends how much longer the line is.\n\nYou ARE affecting other people around you and that's a balance. I have chronic migraines, if I was stuck in a line with a screaming child for an extended period of time I'd likely have an attack triggered. There may be other children like your daughter who are sensitive to that much noise that can also be triggered.\n\nThat doesn't mean you should beat your child, that advice is out of line. And yes you may not be able to stop her. But at that point you should leave. There are consequences for behavior and even if she doesn't understand them they still exist. Try again later for the ride maybe when the line isn't so bad and find something else to do in the meantime.\n\nAlso next time it may be worth looking into accommodations for your daughter and if she'd qualify for something like shorter wait lines for disability considerations. I know people sometimes judge others for using it but I am 100% pro using those accommodations when appropriate both for your daughter's well-being and those around you!", "I went when I was 3. I think it\u2019s a good age to go there. I was young enough to believe I was meeting the REAL Ninja Turtles but old enough that I can still remember meeting them. Going to Disney is one of my earliest memories. NTA + you\u2019re a great mom!", "The problem is the actually misbehaving brats that come out fuck things up ruin it for all kids. If people knew she had brain damage I\u2019m 99% certain nobody would say anything and they would actually be happy to accommodate if they could.\n\nSucks but reality is a lot more unforgiving then people are prepared to admit", "Thank you! I wish the person I spoke to had told me all of this. Your advice has made me want to go back. I need to learn how to ignore everyone\u2019s looks and commentary. People just really know how to make you feel crappy, you know?", "The line wasn\u2019t that much longer, which is why I decided to stay in line. And as I said, if we left the line the only thing that would happen is she would continue to scream until she passed out, effectively ending our day. That did end up happening because of what that person said\u2026after I tried apologizing to the people around us.\n\nAnd as I said in other comments, I did look into accommodations and was told there wasn\u2019t really an option and we had to stay in the regular lines. That\u2019s not my fault.", "Guest Relations can be very particular about giving people DAS passes because people have wildly abused the system in the past.  Unfortunately that means that people who really, genuinely need it don\u2019t realize it\u2019s an option for them.  You basically need to know exactly how to word the request, which is super unfair to first time visitors with needs.\n\nAlso, next time you go try to take advantage of the child care centers if your kiddo gets overwhelmed.  There\u2019s one in every park and they are a nice, quiet place for a toddler to take a breather.  They also have fantastic diaper changing stations there.\n\nIf you are going to Disney World and need some tips on quiet places to unwind, feel free to DM me!  Unfortunately I\u2019m not as familiar with Disneyland, but I\u2019m sure someone on the Disneyland subreddit could give you some great info!\n\nETA because I forgot, yes people can really, truly suck!  I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve had people judge my parenting before when my kid has tried to just lay down in line or got worked up because we weren\u2019t moving or tried to push past to get to the front faster.  But they don\u2019t know my child or his needs.  As a rule I never judge parents who have a kid crying, yelling, or otherwise being loud in Disney because Disney can be overwhelming even for neurotypical adults, much less young kids.  Ignore those people, or make them wildly uncomfortable by asking if they\u2019re always mean to toddlers with brain damage.", "That makes sense. Most of the accessible things we need for my toddler are incredibly hard to find because someone thought it was a parenting hack and made it go viral. Makes sense people would do that for Disney as well.\n\nWe did know about the child care centers! Those came in handy for getting the warm water we needed to flush her meds through her g-tube. But I would appreciate all the tips I could get!\n\nI knew people sucked but I didn\u2019t expect to be met with such hostility from so many people! The only people that were kind were the cast workers. I do my best to help other people I see struggling, but not one person offered help or even a kind word. I guess I just need to be stronger.", "There are free Disney travel agents that can help you plan your trip and better help you understand your options. Look into those services!
