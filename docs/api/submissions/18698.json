My cousin has all the support she needs and I suspect (based on things I\u2019ve seen/heard) that my cousin is failing this class because she has 0 interest in it.

If you don't want to help your niece just word it nicely if you want to salvage contact with your aunt/father or just cut them off if you don't since your family acts very toxic based on how they treat Jack and it looks like they are trying to use you as magic free tutor who'll make niece into genius.", "NTA. They all saw that Jack was struggling, and instead of getting him help or helping him themselves, they chose to laugh at and insult him.

OP here's something to think about. Jack wasn't teased solely because of his grades. He was teased and likely ostracized because he's your dad's bastard child. The grades are just the excuse your family uses to bully Jack, and it IS bullying. You saw that ostracization and saw something of yourself in Jack. That's why you connected to him. You don't have that connection to your other family members. It's not selfish. It's recognizing the bullying and giving Jack a safe harbor and not wanting to take that away from him. And maybe you're able to put that into so many words, but deep down you recognize it. That, and there's only so many times you can say no to something before you say no.", ">if I was only pretending to be educated because I certainly don\u2019t sound like I am.

Second, yeah, you don't owe the others free help.\n\nYeah, once you do this sort of thing for one person, it never ends, speaking from experience.\n\nHappens to me constantly, in part because it appears I get good results, lol.\n\nA few years ago, friend's daughter, 14, was in a bad place in terms of mental health.  Super behind in classes.  I ended up giving a lot of help over those 2 years.  Which means I did a lot of her late assignments.  So many.\n\nto be clear -I'm aware of the shortcomings of me doing the work for her.  Thing is, she's a great student, gets awesome marks, very talented.  But, anxiety/executive dysfunction meant she couldn't start on things.  So, a week before term end, she'd have 12 late assignments of various sorts and subjects.\n\nAs it played out, once I got a couple out of the way for her, she would jump in and complete half of them on her own.\n\nPlus,her mom did have her seeing a therapist to deal with the anxiety and depression issues.\n\nHaven't had to help, at all, for at least 2 years.  Daughter is happy, getting straight A's, doesn't need help.\n\nthank god.  Was getting tired of fucking Shakespeare essays.\n\nAlso - I made certain to show her the stages/drafts of things like essays, so she could see how to approach and write them on her own.", "NTA- you are a good person for helping a neglected child.
