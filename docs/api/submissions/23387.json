Even though her job is likely stretching her thin and lack of sleep has her lashing out, you have no obligation to tolerate the behavior. Those are some harsh words that I suspect will stick with you for a while. They aren\u2019t something you just wipe from your memory. If you don\u2019t think you can genuinely and wholeheartedly forgive her for the disrespect\u2014and honestly, who could blame you?\u2014then go your separate ways.", "NTA. You were heartbroken and understandably so. Sorry for what you\u2019re going through", "I say nta.\n\nThis incident was the straw that broke the camels back.\n\nI would have done the same.  If she cant logically see what she is doing and apologize. I would have second thoughts", "NTA she has been using and abusing you. You seem like a kind and caring person, and she has tried to destroy your self esteem to control you.", "NTA. People need to start realizing that what they say when they\u2019re angry/irritated isn\u2019t excusable or can be brushed away. Doesn\u2019t matter what she meant, she said what she said to hurt you and sounds like she does it regularly. No one needs to deal with that. I wouldn\u2019t \u201cdivorce immediately\u201d though, maybe this is the wake up call she needs.", "NTA,\nI get she\u2019s stressed and sleep deprived but that is absolutely no excuse for screaming at you over a meal \u2026 because she didn\u2019t like it. She was being abusive and awful. You drew a line. How you proceed from here is up to you but having a zero tolerance for abusive behavior is never a mistake imo.", "NTA.  Your wife isn't getting enough sleep, she's overworked, and I can guarantee she's not getting paid enough for what she does. It's a shitty situation and it'll be wearing her down.  \n\nBut none of that makes it okay to scream at you like that... Then to try and downplay it when you told her to get out, not an apology, but telling you \"don't be so dramatic\".\n\nIt's easy to lash out when you're in a bad place, especially at those closest to you, but if you make a habit of it then you'll quickly find that nobody wants to be around you.  I hope for both your sakes that this isn't a regular occurence.", "Sometimes harsh things are said out of anger,  but if this is a continuous issue where she puts you down in that way, NTA.", "INFO: is this the latest in a long line of her demonstrating a lack of respect for you and what you do for her? Or is this a one-off episode?\n\nShe clearly stepped over the line in what she said. It was cruel and harsh. Her words hurt you, they cut you deeply. She compounded the problem when she dismissed your justified feelings by calling you overly dramatic.\n\nIf this was not typical for her, though, then this is a crisis point, but not necessarily the end. Telling her to never come back was understandable in the heat of the moment, but you aren't obligated to follow through on that.\n\nYou two need to have a heart to heart talk. You need her to know that you've tried to express your love for her for four years through your taking care of her. She has to hear that without being defensive. If she truly feels contempt for who you are and what you do, the marriage may be over. But if she expressed, in the worst possible way, momentary frustration and weariness and unhappiness with her life, then you need to try to understand and forgive each other.\n\nFrom the sound of it, this communication would probably best be done with a marriage counselor. They are trained in how to facilitate real communication, how to get each of you to focus on what's really wrong, how to get you to realize what you should both be appreciating, and  how to listen without interruption or dismissiveness.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nYou guys are just in a difficult phase in life, she's throwing her stress to you, you're throwing yours to her. Communicate and talk with each other and see what's the issue that's making you guys like this. But if you think you can't go back to normal because of the words thrown, do what you see best.", "NTA Personally I was not in this situation but I can see both sides. I do think you did overreact BUT what she did was not okay. I am not in your shoes so I don't know what fully happened but I would say you may have overstepped. I'd say you are not the asshole", "NTA you\u2019re going above and beyond for her. Regardless of the fact that she\u2019s stretched thin, her outburst was unacceptable. I definitely think the space is necessary for the two of you to evaluate your relationship.", "YTA for forgetting punctuation exists and making me read that", "Nope. Kick her to the curb", "As jokes have a grain of truth.  So do words said in the heat of the moment.  \n\nShe's having second thoughts apparently.  Might pass might not pass.  Time will tell.", "INFO: do you work as well? \n\nbut i also think her running on 4 or less hours of sleep makes her way easier to get annoyed or angry even tho she shouldn\u2019t be taking it out on you when you\u2019re trying to help", "She needs to contact EAP at her job.  She had hit burnout and is hurting.   She is trying to make everyone around her she considers safe hurt like she is.\n\nAs it stands:  ESH", "ESH. She\u2019s exhausted and cranky and took it out on you. You went scorched Earth by throwing her out on her ear. You both need to calm the eff down and talk like adults. Stop coddling her as much so she doesn\u2019t take you for granted. If she doesn\u2019t like dinner she can sthu and go fetch herself something else. Communication is the only way to have a successful relationship.", "She sounds burnt out. ESH or YTA \u201ccalm down\u201d is never what to say to an angry person. That\u2019s like pouring gasoline on a fire. Also: who pays for this house? If it\u2019s a shared house or her house\u2026I don\u2019t think kicking her out is cool if it\u2019s yours, go for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You truly want to give it. You just have to know that it's truly appreciated. She has to acknowledge that what she said was extreme and naturally causes you to question whether she values you.
