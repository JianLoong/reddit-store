We live next to \"Stan and Maureen\", who are in their 50s.\n\nWhen we moved in, they had a dog named Ginger. When Ginger was 16, we adopted our puppy, Savannah. Just 2 months later, Ginger got sick and had to be put down. We had a doggy door leading into our fenced in property. Savannah was a well behaved dog, didn\u2019t bark, minded her own business, etc. Stan would even comment that Ginger wasn\u2019t as well behaved. I know that Maureen hated Savannah after Ginger died and I tried to be sympathetic. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it is to come home from putting your dog down and seeing a puppy next door.\n\nHowever, how Maureen handled this was terrible. She\u2019d constantly yell at Savannah over the fence. She\u2019d get mad if Savannah went out there when she was, complaining that our dog would just stare at her. If my kids were out playing with Savannah, Maureen would complain that they were \u201ctoo loud\u201d.\n\nOne day, I was on the back deck with the kids. Savannah played in the yard. Maureen was next door, gardening. Savannah scampered over to the shared fence to check out what was going on. Maureen sprayed her with the hose. I told my kids to go inside and told Maureen off. She tried saying that she just wanted her away from the fence. I pointed out that Savannah was just sitting there and even if she wanted her to move, there were other ways. We put up a new fence not long after and stopped talking to Maureen for the most part. This was 10 years ago. We knew Maureen still hated Savannah and she\u2019d often make comments about her and even admitted, she didn\u2019t have a good reason to hate her.\n\nA few months ago, we adopted another dog, Harriet. Savannah unexpectedly passed a few weeks ago. It was hard on all of us. A week later, Maureen adopted a dog as well, Frankie. She instantly started trying to talk to us again. She pretended like nothing ever happened. This pissed me off. Up until the week before Savannah died, Maureen was making comments about her. Now, she wants to pretend everything is fine? \n\nShe always seems to come outside when we are. Which wouldn\u2019t be a problem if she didn\u2019t try to distract Harriet, talk to her, etc. I end up taking Harriet for walks when this happens to avoid her. One day, Maureen wanted to come with us and I said she was free to walk, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to be social. She asked why I was so mad and I said \u201cBecause you were cruel to Savannah for 10 years! I\u2019m not going to turn that off just because she\u2019s gone and you want to play nice now.\u201d She tried to say that I had to understand how she felt, that she always resented Savannah. I pointed out that it was hard seeing her with Frankie after Savannah died, but I would never yell at him or especially spray him with a hose! \n\nMy husband thinks I should get over it, as neither of us are going anywhere. I said I\u2019ll be cordial, but I\u2019m not going to be her friend. He thinks I\u2019m being petty.

She was deliberately nasty to you and the kids as well as your innocent pet, and went out of her way to be disruptive and cruel to all of you simply because she enjoyed it.

Ask him why he is okay with someone who spends a decade bullying every member of his family.\n\nUltimately, if he won\u2019t get his head out of his ass about it, lay it on the line: she is a horrible, self-centred person and the more he takes her side over her nastiness, the *less* inclined you will be to even be pleasant to her about it. He cannot pester you into liking a bully who targeted you, even if he doesn\u2019t care how she hurt you or any other family member. He can decide to treat the feelings and wishes of a bully who is cruel to animals as more important than his wife, kids or pets if he likes, but he\u2019s not going to achieve improving your relationship with her - all he is going to manage is damaging his relationship with you.

I\u2019m only friends with people who add to my happiness.  \n\nHer selfish and frankly sociopathic response to your new puppy is all the warning anyone needs.  \n\nFuck Maureen.", "She even admitted to resenting the dog, totally showing OP that all those instances were intentional and not just flippant cruelty.", "It isn't healthy to hold a grudge against anyone but I don't think that entails bringing your dog around someone who clearly doesn't like them and hurt your previous one. OP isn't wrong for that.", "And so accurate!", "So if a dog's ugly, it's okay to spray it with water and scream at it over a fence every time you see it... Huh, guess we've found the AH", "Its just a dog. Big deal. It doesn\u2019t know any better. It isn\u2019t like she beat it. OP is just sad that no everybody thinks his \u201cwiddle doggo\u201d is precious.", "Yes yes, you hate dogs, we get it. Doesn't change the fact the neighbour's got no right to have done any of this, then expect OP to want to be friends. The fact she was targeting a dog makes it worse imo, but if a neighbour screams and sprays water at a *chair* in my garden on sight for ten years, I'm not going to want anything to do with them.", "Lol you're so worked up over the mention of a dog existing inside the fenced yard of its owner \ud83d\ude02 I can picture your sweaty little hands shaking with rage as you type on your phone", "Hell no. NTA.", "NTA - Not only is Maureen an AH, but she's shown no redeeming qualities. Why would you want her around? On top of that, instead seeing anything wrong with her behavior and apologizing, she can only mutter something about understanding her feelings.", "NTA that woman is freaking insane", "I just put down my dog yesterday. It was devastating to me so hearing how cruel Maureen was to you has me wanting to throw hands at her. I wouldn\u2019t be knowingly cruel to another dog just because mine is gone. Eff Maureen and tell your husband to mind his business if he can\u2019t empathize. \n\nNTA.", "Anyone who treats an animal badly is always TA.", "NTA\u2026nope.  You may not be going anywhere, but why does your husband expect you to get over it?  This woman was not your friend, but now all of a sudden wants to be?  Nope.  You have enough friends.  Tell neighbor to pound sand.", "NTA If I were you I'd die on this hill.", "Nta. You treat your pets like I always did, as part of the family. If she had acted like that towards someone's child for 10 years,  people wouldn't expect her to forgive this woman. \n\n Well, that's what your dog was to you, one of your children, who you loved deeply. Screw that neighbor. Just because she wants to play nice now,  doesn't mean you have to interact with her.", "I had thoughts along the same lines when OP said Savannah died unexpectedly. Unless OP is certain of the circumstances I wouldn't rule out foul play.", "My Tallis, during her final months, enjoyed an all-beef diet. It was expensive for me, but it was all she'd eat, so it's what she got. She was my girl for 18 years, so...", "I had the same thought.", "OP is right through and through, she needs to keep her dog well away from that neighbour - I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not petty to still be mad now that her dog is dead.", "Nope. I just don\u2019t have the pathetic illusion that a dog is anything but an animal. It doesn\u2019t know or care that the neighbor doesn\u2019t like it.", "Hmm well the op specified that her dog: played in the yard, and sat near the fence, and sometimes looked at the neighbor while sitting near the fence. She further specified that she purposely removed the dog from the yard and took it out for walks when the neighbour came outside.\n\nYour response is that the dog sounds like the worst stereotype of a pet, that OP is an oblivious owner who expects everyone to 'pamper and pander to' the dog, and that the dog doesn't respect personal space (? How exactly? Was always described on owners side of the fence, or on walk with owner, and was at no point described doing anything other than approaching the OP's side of the fence).\n\nThat's such a wild overreaction to the info presented that it just comes across as though you're pissy at a dog owner in your personal life and frothing at the mouth to vent some dog vitriol \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe level of venom and weird mocking 'widdle pupper furbaby' shit makes you come across as very, very triggered by the concept of dog owners existing.", "I bet you smell like dog."]}
