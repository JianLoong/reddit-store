{"id": 14926, "submission_id": "12ny70w", "title": "AITA for not forgiving my neighbor for treating my dog terribly?", "selftext": "I (38F) have lived in the same home for 18 years. We live next to \"Stan and Maureen\", who are in their 50s.\n\nWhen we moved in, they had a dog named Ginger. When Ginger was 16, we adopted our puppy, Savannah. Just 2 months later, Ginger got sick and had to be put down. We had a doggy door leading into our fenced in property. Savannah was a well behaved dog, didn\u2019t bark, minded her own business, etc. Stan would even comment that Ginger wasn\u2019t as well behaved. I know that Maureen hated Savannah after Ginger died and I tried to be sympathetic. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it is to come home from putting your dog down and seeing a puppy next door.\n\nHowever, how Maureen handled this was terrible. She\u2019d constantly yell at Savannah over the fence. She\u2019d get mad if Savannah went out there when she was, complaining that our dog would just stare at her. If my kids were out playing with Savannah, Maureen would complain that they were \u201ctoo loud\u201d.\n\nOne day, I was on the back deck with the kids. Savannah played in the yard. Maureen was next door, gardening. Savannah scampered over to the shared fence to check out what was going on. Maureen sprayed her with the hose. I told my kids to go inside and told Maureen off. She tried saying that she just wanted her away from the fence. I pointed out that Savannah was just sitting there and even if she wanted her to move, there were other ways. We put up a new fence not long after and stopped talking to Maureen for the most part. This was 10 years ago. We knew Maureen still hated Savannah and she\u2019d often make comments about her and even admitted, she didn\u2019t have a good reason to hate her.\n\nA few months ago, we adopted another dog, Harriet. Savannah unexpectedly passed a few weeks ago. It was hard on all of us. A week later, Maureen adopted a dog as well, Frankie. She instantly started trying to talk to us again. She pretended like nothing ever happened. This pissed me off. Up until the week before Savannah died, Maureen was making comments about her. Now, she wants to pretend everything is fine? \n\nShe always seems to come outside when we are. Which wouldn\u2019t be a problem if she didn\u2019t try to distract Harriet, talk to her, etc. I end up taking Harriet for walks when this happens to avoid her. One day, Maureen wanted to come with us and I said she was free to walk, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to be social. She asked why I was so mad and I said \u201cBecause you were cruel to Savannah for 10 years! I\u2019m not going to turn that off just because she\u2019s gone and you want to play nice now.\u201d She tried to say that I had to understand how she felt, that she always resented Savannah. I pointed out that it was hard seeing her with Frankie after Savannah died, but I would never yell at him or especially spray him with a hose! \n\nMy husband thinks I should get over it, as neither of us are going anywhere. I said I\u2019ll be cordial, but I\u2019m not going to be her friend. He thinks I\u2019m being petty.

Be clear with him that he doesn\u2019t get to police or dictate who you are friends with. You don\u2019t like her because of her behaviour: she has not apologised for it, and she has indicated she was cruel to an animal *and rude and mean to you and your children on purpose, for ten years*, solely to make herself feel better. She was deliberately nasty to you and the kids as well as your innocent pet, and went out of her way to be disruptive and cruel to all of you simply because she enjoyed it. Ask him which part of that indicates she is a nice person you should now be friends with. Ask him why he is okay with someone who spends a decade bullying every member of his family.\n\nUltimately, if he won\u2019t get his head out of his ass about it, lay it on the line: she is a horrible, self-centred person and the more he takes her side over her nastiness, the *less* inclined you will be to even be pleasant to her about it. He cannot pester you into liking a bully who targeted you, even if he doesn\u2019t care how she hurt you or any other family member. He can decide to treat the feelings and wishes of a bully who is cruel to animals as more important than his wife, kids or pets if he likes, but he\u2019s not going to achieve improving your relationship with her - all he is going to manage is damaging his relationship with you.
