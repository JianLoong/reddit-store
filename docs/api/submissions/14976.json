She was on state housing and disability but it was turned off without warning. We are trying to fight it currently but from as far as I can tell, she's not the only person this has happened to this month (like hundreds of elderly are going through this). She has Lupus so she has no job. She's 59. We have a 5 bedroom house (3 kids who have their own room and then the 4th bedroom is used as our shared office). I suggested letting my mother move in here and letting her stay in our office, which would have to be relocated to maybe the attic. She immediately said \"fuck no, not happening\". \n\nI remained calm, despite her hostility surrounding the issue bothering me. I tried coming up with every alternative imaginable and she shot down every single idea. I found it a little weird because her and my mom get along really well (like I'm pretty sure my mom likes my wife more than she likes me). So I finally snapped and asked her what the fuck her problem was and why she was acting so miserable. She snaps back with \"last I fucking checked, you're fully aware that I refuse to be around your mother's fucking dog. Her dog is not coming here. Her dog is not allowed here. She won't get rid of her dog, therefore she has no place here.\" I honestly hadn't even thought about the dog up till this point. My mom has a Rottweiler who's like 2 years old and he's a big boy. He's gompy. My wife doesn't like the dog at all (she used to get chased by Rottweilers as a kid but never been bitten) so she won't even give the dog a chance. She admittedly doesn't like any dog outside of like.. retrievers. But I still feel this is rather ignorant. \n\nI told her she was being incredibly selfish for being unwilling to help my mother over a dog and she absolutely lost it. She said that her life is not going to be revolved around taking care of my disabled mother AND take care of an untrained giant Rottweiler. She said she's also not chancing having this \"mutt\" around our kids while untrained and she is \"absolutely repulsed\" that I'm not seeing how dangerous it could be (we have small kids). She said I'm an \"absolute prick\" and under no circumstances was she going to put my mother over the well being of our kids and if I can do that, I had better see myself out. I think she's over the fucking top, to be blunt. AITA?\n\nETA: my wife is in therapy. Therapy doesn't take away fears. She said mom could move in if she doesn't have the dog. My mom refuses. It's my wife's house. She inherited it long before we married. She works from home full time and has the kids.

Just flip this conversation around and imagine she had told you that you were over reacting to having her mother move into your house with a dog that would likely poop and pee everywhere, leave dog hair on everything, tear up the furniture and kid toys, and potentially bight family members.

This ask of your wife is bigger than you realize.", "YTA\n\nyou intentionally left out the part where your wife agreed to let your mom stay without her untrained dog.

In your update you mention she has a phobia and won't even tolerate her parents' dog.  I like dogs and I still find Rottweilers quite intimidating. \nYou expect her to live with your mother (massive imposition- they might get on but it doesn't mean she wants to live with her) and an animal that terrifies her?\n\nAnd regarding the safety of kids, check the news and the number of incidents with untrained dogs and kids.

It\u2019s her own fault if she lost the housing designation.\n\n\nLastly, Lupus is no joke and it is very painful. They tested me for lupus before I got my final diagnoses.  And anybody suggesting pain management for long term chronic pain is clueless. It may work at first, but since there is ultimately no relief from or treatment for the pain, the pain management ultimately always fails because it\u2019s a stupid program, not designed for long term, No matter what they say.

But, because, from your comments, it actually sounds like you agree with your wife that the dog would be a huge problem, without actually saying you agree with your wife. You acknowledge that the dog is untrained, and you have young children it would jump on, as well as chew up their toys, probably everything else. Your mom refuses to have it trained, won\u2019t stop it from jumping on ppl so it will probably jump on your kids. You know this would be dangerous. But, you feel like you have to push your wife to agree to placate your mom, and then you can tell your mom that you want her to move in, but your wife won\u2019t agree unless she gets rid of the dog. It really sounds like you are throwing your wife under the bus ( even though you agree with her ) because you are afraid to disagree with your mom or tell her no. Which makes you the biggest AH. I\u2019m also curious as to how your disabled mom who is in to much pain to work is able to handle a large 2 year old rottie jumping on her.", "YTA. Your wife is terrified of dogs. You already knew that. She gave her own family the same answer, so this isn't some new change. She would be willing to help your mother, but she isn't willing to be terrified in her own home.

This is a boundary your wife has. Your mom seems unwilling to compromise so she needs to find somewhere else to live. Your wife said she could stay there herself so she is already putting in the effort, especially since she works from home.", "YTA I absolutely love dogs but wouldn\u2019t want an untrained rottie near my young kids. Your wife understandably has fears from childhood and let\u2019s face it\u2026your Mom is not well and with your wife working from home she would end up responsible for the care of the dog. If your mom really needs a place to stay she\u2019d re-home her dog. \nI had to re-home two dogs three years ago after my husband died. I had to move several provinces away to a big city and my dogs were country dogs. I found them both excellent homes and am still in contact with their new caretakers.

I'm a HUGE dog lover but your Mom's decision to not train her dog is the roadblock here and your wife is 100% right not to allow a large untrained Rotty into the house. Whatsmore, it sounds like you are trying a bait and switch and your wife knows it - she doesn't want to be stuck caring for your Mom who refuses any responsibility for her own life whatsoever.\n\nQuite honestly, in your wife's shoes, if you did move your Mom in under these circumstances, the kids and I would be moving out until she left. You are putting your wife in a HORRIBLY unfair position and you will destroy your marriage if you force this.\n\nYTA", "Your mom won\u2019t take meds to help with her pain so she can work and not be homeless and won\u2019t compromise on her dog staying somewhere else so your wife doesn\u2019t have to deal with him. Your mom is an asshole and so are you.", "Your mom sounds like a grifter.", "Dude your mom isn\u2019t willing to help herself. Instead of being an ass to your wife because she has very valid reasons take that energy out on your mom.", "Well this is important. She doesn\u2019t believe in medication and can\u2019t work because she is in pain that she won\u2019t treat. \n\nShe won\u2019t help herself, why should your wife sacrifice to help her?", "Why would she? THC has done it all for her, so now she can find a job.", "And his mom isn\u2019t \u201celderly.\u201d 59 isn\u2019t even retirement-aged. My elderly mom (82) made far bigger sacrifices when her memory began to fail and she could no longer live alone. OP\u2019s wife is spot-on in her assessment of the issues here, and they have decades before elderly issues even come into play. YTA, OP.", "This is exactly it you hit the nail right on the head.\n\n He's allowing his manipulative mother to control him. Which will turn wife's life upside down. OP is so used to it he can't or won't see how unhealthy this is. Mom can work. Mom is choosing weed over real doctors. An untrained rottweiler is not safe near children OR near people fearful of dogs.", "I think we can guess why her special housing was revoked. She can work, she just chooses not too", "This. OP, read this carefully.\n\nYTA", "In his wife's place I d change the locks and put him out to seek some other home with his mother. YTA op and a huge one", "$50 bucks says she didn't lose social housing suddenly and without warning.\n\n50/50 it's something to do with the dog.", "100% agree with you on this!!", "Please accept my fake award. \ud83c\udfc6", "THIS. \n\nYour mum is refusing treatment for her life limiting autoimmune condition, treatment that is backed by years of peer reviewed research. Treatment that can send people with Lupus into remission. I don't know if your mum has the same type of Lupus as a couple of my friends, but I do know that my friends were really really sick a few years ago, in huge amounts of pain with multi organ issues, but are now in remission. Because they... *Checks notes* took big pharma meds (gasp). \n\nYour wife absolutely has the right to refuse to house her and an enormous untrained dog. \n\nWe've recently been in this position with a friend; he is disabled, living with his grandma who is his last remaining family member. She's a manipulative narcissistic, financially & emotionally abusive. We & other friends have given him advice, given him & his dog a place to crash when she has become too abusive (police involved), helped him relocate to new housing, but he keeps going back to her and has moved back in. Unable and unwilling to protect himself and take steps to improve his circumstances. So we no longer drop everything to help him, which he is angry about. He wants all his friends to enable the continual cycle of abuse and tell him it's okay. \n\nYou need to draw a line in the sand with your mother, like we did our friend. Give her the steps she can take to improve her life (see a doctor, get a job etc etc) but until she does that, no dice.", "Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they would let her have a Rottweiler in special housing.  And how does she support such a large dog?"]}
