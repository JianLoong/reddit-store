{"id": 1968, "submission_id": "yrjzny", "title": "AITA for calling out my ex's new wife for being unemployed", "selftext": "This is a weird title but here's what actually happened. My ex and I broke up 5 years ago after a year-long relationship, he broke up with me and I took it very hard back then. I can't say I did anything crazy, aside from a few weeks after the break up getting really drunk on a night out and sending him some embarrassing texts. It was the worst heartbreak I've ever had, and it didn't help that he kept messaging me to be \"friends\" even though I tried to set boundaries and say I need space to heal. \n\nAnyways, that's all in the past. I can confidently say that I have indeed healed from that and am over him. He recently got married to a girl he started dating like 2 months after we broke up. Honestly, I'm happy for him. Good for them. Me, on the other hand, I've dated since then but haven't been able to find anyone worth marrying; I haven't even had another serious relationship since him. \n\nHe's still in the periphery of my social circle, because we still have a lot of mutual friends from uni. And sometimes I see both of them in social settings. While he and I have buried the hatchet and usually just chat when we happen to be in the same room for a bit (although we never text or meet up outside of these contexts), his wife and I have always treated each other with polite disinterest. I know she really doesn't like me. An important note about her is that she's been unemployed for a loooong time. Idk if its because she wants to be a stay-at-home-wife (completely valid choice if that's her thing!) or because she's been unable to find work, but she hasn't worked in many years despite having a masters degree. I've been really able to advance in my career in the past 5 years, and I'm quite far ahead in my field for someone my age and I'm very proud of myself because I worked extremely hard. \n\nAnyways here's the issue: the other day a bunch of people went for drinks. I came. They were both there. We were all sitting at the same table in a bar. Someone I haven't seen in awhile asked me if I'm dating anyone. I replied \"no, not right now.\" My ex's wife quickly made a snark comment \"aw it's okay, some people just stay single\" in front of everyone, like 10 of our friends.  Without missing a beat, I blurted out \"yeah just like some people are meant to stay unemployed\". \n\nShe got really upset, cried and left. Her husband messaged me that I should apologize to her for embarrassing her. I said I will if she apologizes first. He said she refused because what I said was worse, apparently.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668097412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrjzny/aita_for_calling_out_my_exs_new_wife_for_being/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has no justification for saying that to you, but you also made a dig at her without knowing her reasons for not having a job. Idk about what's worse, but they're both equally petty comments and she fired first so she should apologize first or you can be the bigger person and apologize and state why you made that dig.

Maybe she'll learn.", "ESH, yeah what she said was rude and unnecessary but you did not need to stoop to her level. Yes it feels embarrassing to have a comment made about you in front of 10 people (who you've referred to as mutual friends) but if these people care about you any amount then they will acknowledge that your ex's wife made an ass of herself. Her words reflect more on her than you. You stooping to her level may have felt like a good clap back, but it's a fast way to kill the mood of a get together. \nShe should apologize for what she said but you should also.", "NTA.  If she can't take it, then she shouldn't dish it out.", "NTA.  People need to learn not to start shit unless they can handle someone else finishing it for them.

You are clearly not over him in a way that can be described as healthy enough to maintain a friendship.  Given the history, she is probably a bit threatened by you especially since you haven't had a relationship since him.  You both said things that were out of line.", "NTA!! And good for you for standing up for yourself. There was absolutely no reason for her to comment and what were you supposed to do, just sit there?\n\nShe tried to be snarky and you gave as good as you got. There is ZERO reason to take shit from anyone.", "NTA.

It seems like a lot of insecurity on her end.\n\nEven though you are on good terms with your ex now, do you think it's possible to cut ties with him? It just seems like his wife gets a kick out of trying to berate you. He will always have to take her side since she is his life partner now. I just feel like it's going to cause a weird drift in your social circle if she keeps getting included, and she will, because she is his wife.", "NTA You should not apologize.  Her claws came out, your claws came out with a meaningful retort.\n\nUnless you've done something you are truly remorseful for, an apology is made in the interest of maintaining a relationship.  You don't want or need to maintain a relationship with this girl.  She tried to publicly humiliate you and it backfired.\n\nCan't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen.", "ESH.  Normally I am for a bit of snark as a riposte to an obviously uncalled-for comment such as your ex's wife made, but there's a kicker.\n\nYou mention she is unemployed, but you allude to admitting that you don't know any details beyond that.  Perhaps, as you suggested, they are indeed trying for a family and are in mutual agreement on her being a stay-at-home wife.  There's the possibility that she is *unable* to work, for whatever reason, as opposed to *unwilling*.\n\nThat's why your comment crossed the line, just like hers did.", "ESH. are you also a 12 year old?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
