My ex and I broke up 5 years ago after a year-long relationship, he broke up with me and I took it very hard back then. I can't say I did anything crazy, aside from a few weeks after the break up getting really drunk on a night out and sending him some embarrassing texts. It was the worst heartbreak I've ever had, and it didn't help that he kept messaging me to be \"friends\" even though I tried to set boundaries and say I need space to heal. \n\nAnyways, that's all in the past. I can confidently say that I have indeed healed from that and am over him. He recently got married to a girl he started dating like 2 months after we broke up. Honestly, I'm happy for him. Good for them. Me, on the other hand, I've dated since then but haven't been able to find anyone worth marrying; I haven't even had another serious relationship since him. \n\nHe's still in the periphery of my social circle, because we still have a lot of mutual friends from uni. And sometimes I see both of them in social settings. While he and I have buried the hatchet and usually just chat when we happen to be in the same room for a bit (although we never text or meet up outside of these contexts), his wife and I have always treated each other with polite disinterest. I know she really doesn't like me. An important note about her is that she's been unemployed for a loooong time. Idk if its because she wants to be a stay-at-home-wife (completely valid choice if that's her thing!) or because she's been unable to find work, but she hasn't worked in many years despite having a masters degree. I've been really able to advance in my career in the past 5 years, and I'm quite far ahead in my field for someone my age and I'm very proud of myself because I worked extremely hard. \n\nAnyways here's the issue: the other day a bunch of people went for drinks. I came. They were both there. We were all sitting at the same table in a bar. Someone I haven't seen in awhile asked me if I'm dating anyone. I replied \"no, not right now.\" My ex's wife quickly made a snark comment \"aw it's okay, some people just stay single\" in front of everyone, like 10 of our friends.  Without missing a beat, I blurted out \"yeah just like some people are meant to stay unemployed\". \n\nShe got really upset, cried and left. Her husband messaged me that I should apologize to her for embarrassing her. I said I will if she apologizes first.

I don\u2019t view the single thing as inherently insulting, I didn\u2019t read anything in OP\u2019s post that would indicate she\u2019s particularly bothered by being single (until the clapback), and I think there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about ex\u2019s wife\u2019s situation (including why she allegedly doesn\u2019t like OP, why she isn\u2019t employed etc).

We can\u2019t police someone\u2019s thoughts or feelings, all we can do is hold them to a standard of not being rude or mean.", "Yeah a scenario like this happened to me. Distant ex/fling of my partner gets arsey I am not working and has a go in front of everyone. Always been unfriendly so I and my partner had not made it specific knowledge I\u2019m invisibly disabled because people judge to fuck.\n\nBy the time seven years on she decided to hiss venom, I waa not working due to a life threatening illness and she got mad I embarrassed her by almost dying. \u2018Well no one told me.\u2019 Yes because you are an irrelevance. No one told me she bought a house while I rent because exes are not that important unless close friends or co-parents.\n\nLots of people who don\u2019t work don\u2019t want to justify it if their spouse or partner is on board. I agree ESH but OP sounds way too invested in these people and doth protest too much. I wonder how many digs about unemployment she made up until now to get to here?", "But what if you could XD\nI would love to see some inventions or whatever people can come up with to \"block\" people in real life.\nLegally.", "But he was able to contact OP so not blocked on media", "Judged by the new wife*, who came out with the unsolicited public jab first and is the much bigger AH.", "There's a difference in saying that about someone who had chosen to not date and someone who is actively trying to find a quality life partner", "It was snarky...it was implied that she would stay single as in alone forever. It was an insult.\n\nAnd new wife has no idea why she's single. She should've kept her mouth shut.", "But you never know *today* might be that day they do enjoy it.", "Now I'm imagining cats splashing wine in each other's faces ...", "I\u2019m sorry. Have you met a cat. They definitely *never* find out. And if you THINK they found it, they will assure you they totally meant to do that. \n\nCats = Nothing but fucking around and then napping.", "This is it for me. EVERY human being makes judgements in their head, even judgements that are poor taste/unfair. The line is crosses when that internal judgement is put into the world via spoken word or written. OP has judgements about ex\u2019s wife, just like ex\u2019s wife has judgements about OP. If wife didn\u2019t want to create the opportunity for her feelings to be hurt, she should have kept her judgement internal.", "See Black Mirror....it had an episode about this. Blocked in person", "Is she? I guess that\u2019s not the vibe I got. It sounds like she was expressing being more focused on work than dating.", "I disagree, didn't sound snarky to me, some people do better off single\n\nTo me, this comes across as OP not being over the ex and taking every excuse to not like the new gf, including taking offence at things which aren't meant that way", "If they could get wine glasses in their paws they probably would try it.", "Thanks for letting me know!", "It sounds like she's happy where she is professionally. Has dated around but hasn't found a man that clicked for a relationship. No where does it say that she prioritized her career over dating. No where.", "So, the ex's new wife gets to decide that? \n\nOrrr.. shes not close to her and doesn't want her throwing insults or assuming about her life.", "Maybe the comment could have come from someone else and not be construed as snarky but it came from OP's ex's current wife. No matter what she says, it's going to be taken negatively.", "She didn't decide anything, it's a throwaway comment about some people being better alone, people are taking this alot more personally than I think it was meant.\n\nI'm not sure why you're arguing with me, this is a sub to give opinions and I've given mine with reasoning....", "A throwaway comment that was directed at someone.\n\nYou call this arguing?! Replying to comments giving my own opinions?\n\n Lol..I hope you never encounter real confrontation.\n\nHave a good day, sweetie.", "Had alot in my life actually, its not a nice thing \ud83d\ude14\n\nHave a lovely day too (and I genuinely mean it, life is tough enough for everyone at the moment!)"]}
