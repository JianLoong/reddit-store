My ex and I broke up 5 years ago after a year-long relationship, he broke up with me and I took it very hard back then. I can't say I did anything crazy, aside from a few weeks after the break up getting really drunk on a night out and sending him some embarrassing texts. It was the worst heartbreak I've ever had, and it didn't help that he kept messaging me to be \"friends\" even though I tried to set boundaries and say I need space to heal. \n\nAnyways, that's all in the past. I can confidently say that I have indeed healed from that and am over him. He recently got married to a girl he started dating like 2 months after we broke up. Honestly, I'm happy for him. Good for them. Me, on the other hand, I've dated since then but haven't been able to find anyone worth marrying; I haven't even had another serious relationship since him. \n\nHe's still in the periphery of my social circle, because we still have a lot of mutual friends from uni. And sometimes I see both of them in social settings. While he and I have buried the hatchet and usually just chat when we happen to be in the same room for a bit (although we never text or meet up outside of these contexts), his wife and I have always treated each other with polite disinterest. I know she really doesn't like me. An important note about her is that she's been unemployed for a loooong time. Idk if its because she wants to be a stay-at-home-wife (completely valid choice if that's her thing!) or because she's been unable to find work, but she hasn't worked in many years despite having a masters degree. I've been really able to advance in my career in the past 5 years, and I'm quite far ahead in my field for someone my age and I'm very proud of myself because I worked extremely hard. \n\nAnyways here's the issue: the other day a bunch of people went for drinks. I came. They were both there. We were all sitting at the same table in a bar. Someone I haven't seen in awhile asked me if I'm dating anyone. I replied \"no, not right now.\" My ex's wife quickly made a snark comment \"aw it's okay, some people just stay single\" in front of everyone, like 10 of our friends.  Without missing a beat, I blurted out \"yeah just like some people are meant to stay unemployed\". \n\nShe got really upset, cried and left. Her husband messaged me that I should apologize to her for embarrassing her. I said I will if she apologizes first.

I bet it sounds even better in Swedish. Getting out the Google translate for this one.", "Mine just try to drink mine. I keep a close eye in my wine. I don\u2019t share wine. I wonder what they would do if I actually let them get a sip?", "The guy who owned the worlds oldest cats (he had two of the record holders!) gave them a little red wine every day, lol.", "NTA\nShe was snarky first. You just replied in the same tone. \n\nA woman I used to work with hated me. No clue why but from day one she did not like me. She was about 10-15 years older than me and had worked for the company for many years more than I had. Several years into working together we both happened to buy new cars of the same brand but different levels. I congratulated her on her new vehicle and she said \u201cHusband and I looked at your model but decided it wasn\u2019t nice enough\u201d. Before I could stop myself I responded with, \u201coh that\u2019s great! We compared mine with your model and just decided it looked like an old lady car\u201d. I got called into the big boss\u2019s office for that and when I explained my side he honestly laughed so hard I thought he would pass out.", "NTA. Only non-apology she'd get from me?\n\n\"I'm so sorry you couldn't handle it when I matched your energy. You don't get to come at a person and expect them to not come back at you. You fucked around and you found out. Sorry again that you can't take what you dished out.\"", "NTA - awesome response. She's jealous of you. I would advise him not to reach out to you any further because clearly it's making his wife jealous and their relationship doesn't sound like it's  doing too well. And then block - if you see them out, do a polite nod and avoid conversations. You put her in her place. Love to see it.", "NTA\n\nThe thing is, to justify how good she has it, she has to feel like she won some great prize. I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that she feels she should have ordered a different doughnut.", "NTa - She called you unlovable, you just called her useless.  Unlovable is worse than useless.", "LMAO NTA\n\nI just spat out my drink reading that punchline. You are hilarious and not an asshole in the slightest.", "Sounds like your ex's wife got herself a case of FAFO. If she can tell a person that their not meant to have a significant other in life, then she can take any response that comes with it.", "Nta\n\nTo quote the great movie artistocats...\n\nLadies don't start fights.... but they cam finish them.\n\nThat was a brilliant clap back I'd have laughed pretty hard at that were I there \n\nIf she left crying, so much the better", "NTA- her intent was to put you down and cause you to feel ashamed in front of others. If she can dish it out, she should be able to take it herself. \n\nBtw, she must be very insecure and threatened  around you if she feels it necessary to take digs at you unprompted.", "NTA. lol. I can\u2019t stop laughing. She apparently is quite jealous of you for some reason and just had to be snarky. Boo hoo for her hurt feelings when she got a dose of her own medicine back. She can dish it but can\u2019t take it. Stick to your guns as both statements are equally mean.", "NTA.  \"An eye for an eye.  A tooth for a tooth.\"  She was the instigator with her fake pity insult and all you did was give it back to her.  Your boyfriend is totally wrong that your insult was worse.  Insulting someone over lack of long term relationship is a worse insult for a woman than an insult over employment.  Were you supposed to sit back and take it  like a b\\*\\*ch or was it normal and right for you to give it right back to her with the only ammo you had? Also who cares what a 5 year old ex thinks? He basically was required to defend his wife (even if he thought you were in the right) because if he didn't he'd be in the doghouse with her. So don't apologize.", "ESH. She started it, but you both made things awkward for everyone else with the catty barbs at each other.", "Yeah, I was really ramping up to call op an AH, but nope. It was perfect context. A bit petty, a bit rude. But was was the ex's new wife. The NW miiiiight have meant it to be less insulting and more along the lines of, \"hey, don't worry about that. Not everyone needs a relationship to be valid. You're doing great with your life as is! Everyone's path leads them where they're supposed to go.\" Etc etc etc and just... REAAAAALLY missed the mark. But either way. Op is NTA for how she handled her response.", "Also, I guess OP learned whether the ex's wife is purposefully unemployed.", "People really need to learn that if they fuck around, they really do find out.", "Don't start none, won't be none.", "Well it explains that this girl didn't just make an innocuous comment that came out wrong. She has beef with OP bc of how close her relationship with her husband was to the start of her own relationship. It was only 2 months, and during the beginning of their relationship he kept reaching out to OP to be \"friends.\" Her \"Aww, that's okay.\" wasn't consoling, she was very much mocking her.", "Spot on. I'm surprised I had to scroll so far to find someone else who wondered whether that comment was even supposed to be an insult. Her relationship status relative to this woman is already a sore spot based on OP's mentioning that they began dating shortly after she and the ex broke up, meanwhile OP hasn't found anything that sticks.\n\nOP tries to claim that her employment status is a valid choice, but clearly does not actually believe that as that particular insult was top-of-mind when she felt slighted. I have to wonder if the \"polite disinterest\" they have for one another is really just genuine casual politeness that OP interprets as some sort of passive aggression.\n\nIt's clear that OP has all sorts of feelings wrapped up in this exchange. This feels like ESH but I'm not all that confident that OP's friends would tell this story the same way. OP is thinking this is a well deserved clapback, but frankly it feels more like an emotional outburst.", "So in order for you to see her as not the a** (part of e s h verdict) would be to silently take the insult? Or to be polite even? To let others walk over you is not healthy. The wife spat unnecessary comment, so the response is justified. She may even saved someone in the future from the same treatment. I say NTA. But to each their opinion I guess. Peace.", "Is there something wrong with staying single? I just don't see it as an insult...", "If you don't wanna find out, don't fuck around.", "To quote a TSwift lyric, \"I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends.\"", "This. NTA", "That clapback was fire aswell though \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "People who are really insecure about themselves are the most likely to try and make themselves feel better/superior by getting the digs in at someone else. Then, of course, when the other party fights back, they can't handle it exactly because they're so insecure.\n\nSecure people don't start shit, because they're happily minding their own business.", "That's actually the perfect roast idea LMAO. Next time she attacks OP she should reply \"if you can't believe you should stay home like a good stay at home wife\"", "Exactly. She attacked, she became snack. OP was completely on point", "Idk what you\u2019re trying to say here? If it\u2019s that the ex\u2019s new gf was rude that was the whole point of my paragraph. Otherwise that\u2019s fine\u2014 have a good one !", "Yes, OP was there and so could interpret how it was delivered. Plus there\u2019s an implicit blame when the needling about not being cut out for a relationship comes from someone close to her ex. Ex\u2019s wife is likely to have gotten biased information about OP from her ex.", "You're right, but I think the best thing to do around igmos is just laugh at them or possibly gasp and embarrass them. Retaliating lets  them play the victim card and makes you wonder if you're the ah.", "Feels like there's something missing here. I'm curious to know if Op's drunk texts overlapped with the ex and his wife getting together. I have a hunch Op isn't as politely disinterested as she thinks she is and actually comes off as passive aggressive. I mean it's clear as day she is lying to herself that she's over a 1 year relationship that ended 5 years ago.(Broken up 5x longer than they were together...)", "I mean some people have thoose, they get into trouble alot with there mouth tho since they like just say things with no filter. It's kinda like watching somone playing Russian roulette but the bullet is a good comeback. The last 8 were terrible, but thar last one was a zinger..... then they only talk about the zinger. \n\nHowever most people this would be a hindsight is 2020 for sure story. \n\nWhat makes me think of this is the description of the comeback being with no thought \ud83e\udd14  I've asked before \"why would you even say that\" the response was \"I dident think I just spoke\"", "Every once in a while I manage a good comeback in the moment and I\u2019m always so proud of myself", "Stupid people pull this shit, thinking somebody's gonna take their shit. She obviously thinks she is better than OP, but sure got knocked down a few pegs!!!", "They need to call 911, cause she straight up murdered her lol", "Same, love this", "That is amazing", "We call it \u2018play stupid games, win stupid prizes\u2019 and for sure Mrs Ex effed around and found out. GREAT comeback!!!!", "IMO what the new wife said was worse, because there\u2019s an implication that she has inside information from OP\u2019s ex. Someone close to your ex saying that you\u2019re \u201cmeant to be single\u201d is basically saying that your ex has told them that you\u2019re an awful person in a relationship. OP\u2019s retort was just based on basic external knowledge.\n\nIf OP\u2019s ex has been talking crap about OP to his wife, which the wife isn\u2019t keeping between them and is using to try to poison OP\u2019s interactions with the friends group, then both of them \u2014 the ex\u2019s wife and the ex himself \u2014 owe OP an apology and mended behaviour.", "Exactly.\n\nThe goal is to end the disagreement/fight as soon as possible.", "I had a very similar situation happen to me. Just like OP I refused to apologize until I got one first. I have not seen that girl in 7 years and it\u2019s the best gift she could have given me.", "OMG, I have to remember this the next time someone feels I owe them an apology! \ud83c\udfc6", "You said the backstory of her being with the ex was irrelevant. The comment you\u2019re replying to is explaining how it is relevant since it explains an actual motive rather than leave the benefit of the doubt with miscommunication.", "The Silent part is actually key here. The Ex's Wife is too stupid to remain silent. She brayed like an Ass and got her feelings hurt.", "All humans judge others about something from time to time. However, what's different is how you respond to that judgement. Do you just think it in your head? Or do you say it out loud to make people feel bad? Do you do an action because of your judgement, like assaulting the individual or treat them differently than everyone else? Judgement is a part of being human and it's a necessary skills for both survival and maintaining relationships. If you go on a first date and realize they have a bunch of red flags, you are judging them. If you are walking to your car at night and see someone just standing next to your car and you decide not to approach your car, you were judging. \n\nJust because you have judgements doesn't make you a bad person or in the wrong. It's what you do with those judgements.", "So? As long as it is silent, she can think whatever she wants to.", "IDK about that. The situation, with OP getting dumped and then the ex moving on to his now wife, is the sort of situation that can bring up thoughts of \u201cwhy her but not me\u201d. It\u2019s not necessarily unhealthy for her to reinforce her self-image that she\u2019d rather be her successful self than the girl who got this particular guy. Especially with the wife essentially publicly declaring that the breakup was OP\u2019s fault.", "Also, she says that she doesn't talk to them outside of the social gatherings their both invited to. Maybe she didn't need to block them. I've found that people block people when they are either AH or they're insecure and don't want to be reminded that person exists.
