Losing weight is more than just counting calories and exercising.  It is unlearning habits we learn from our parents and self-esteem issues that can cause us to harm ourselves by overeating on top of the medical problems that cause us to gain weight.  \n\nBe a little more sensitive and ask questions; maybe you will find a way to reach your brother.", "nah NTA, he\u2019s really not living a healthy lifestyle and you\u2019re just trying to help", "NTA - Probably better if a third party not yourself helps.

Physiologically, it is a terrible feeling for someone used to overeating to go through the physical aspects of starvation. I use the word starvation not in the sense that he will starve to death, but in the sense that the body has physical mechanisms that push us to eat more when we feel that starving sensation. \n\nWhen we diet, the body releases a hormone called ghrelin, you probably already know this being pre-med. That hormone makes us feel even more hungry than we already are, making dieting a deeply physiologically and psychologically uncomfortable state to be in. This makes it even harder to sustain and causes dieters to call their personal trainers ass holes, lol. \n\nIf calorie counting isn't working for him, there's an alternative, increasing nutrition. This only works if he doesn't have an eating disorder, at his weight, it doesn't sound like he does. The idea is the dieter plans to eat highly nutritious foods, this requires meal planning, and then they can eat anything they want after that. So for example, focus on 3 or 5 meals with the appropriate balance of 5 servings of veggies and fruits, whole grain carbs, lean proteins and fish. After those meals, the dieter can eat whatever they want. If they don't have an eating disorder, they likely will have a chocolate bar here or there, but they will be too satisfied to indulge on cravings regularly enough to gain weight. Just don't count calories with this method because it will be too complicated. He might choose to incorporate calorie counting in the future, but it will be after establishing healthy eating habits. The amount of energy these foods will give him, he'll probably start jogging everywhere just to release it. The US and UK governments both have food plates with easy to follow directions for this on their websites.", "ESH 250 for pizza and ice cream is a wacky estimate and he\u2019s being a bit rude considering he said he wanted to lose weight and accepted your guidance. However 200lbs at 5\u201910 is barely overweight and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if your parents have been badgering him about it. If you\u2019re concerned about his health, talk about adding more nutrients and movement to his life.

Understanding potions and how to properly calculate the amount of calories one is eating is essential to weight loss.  He stated it wasn\u2019t working, and you identified the reason.

Your brother needs to decide that he actually wants to be healthy before he'll commit. It is so easy to chose to be lazy and eat what you please.

We're all in great shape but our bodies are built differently and do different things - the 110 is a runner, narrow hips, narrow shoulders, small boobs, 150 is generally pretty balanced between cardio and strength training, and 170 and I (180) both lift and dance, but I'm just generally broader shouldered and hipped than 170 even though my waist is smaller. \n\nIf 110 weighed 180, she'd be a balloon, but if I drop below 170, I start to look sick. \n\nAnd before someone gets on about how we can't possibly be 5'5 and those weights without at least one of us being disgusting, 1: get fucked and 2: for reference, 170 and I are unsurprisingly the largest, but consistently wear US medium, size 8 or 10, we traded clothes a lot when we were living closer, 150 is also a medium but usually a size 6, though we can share leggings and occasionally tops, and 110 is a small/size 2, but she's, again, just built really leanly, she's not dangerously thin or anything. We joke that her bones are hollow like a bird since she's so strong but so light. \n\nIt's great that you like your body where it's at, but it is possible to be your height and weigh more OR less than you and be or feel fat. And if someone is fat and likes it, awesome, be happy, and if they don't like it, then I'm sorry to hear it, good luck finding a healthy path to change either your body or your mindset. \n\nBut it's really narrow minded and judgmental to be like \"well, this is my experience and any other experience is invalid, to treat them as such is naggy.\" \n\nOp ASKED if his brother wanted his help.

Thank you? lol", "*sigh*\n\nI've lost a lot of weight over a safe period of time with diet and exercise changes. But that first month, I gained 4kg even with cardio three times a week, half an hour walk every day, and actually measuring out my calories accurately. Because your body goes into starvation mode and hoards calories when you restrict them, you can definitely have an increase. I kept going, and the next month? I'd lost 9kg. Because my body adapted. So you're wrong about it being impossible - a lot of information out there says the same. There's usually peaks and troughs for weight loss, you will burn less calories doing the same exercise as you lose weight because you're moving less mass around and your body has gotten used to it. That's why you need to keep pushing harder and change it up. Same with food- one week your calories may be right, but that sneaky sugar increased. Weight loss isn't linear. I've had about 18 months at this now, and I've had about 3 increases in weight, 10 losses and 5 no change. \n\nYou're not wrong that your brother is gaining weight in this case because he's incorrectly working out his intake. But your lack of knowledge, and probably also lack of imparting relevent information such as how exactly to measure and work out calories, certainly doesn't help your brother. You're trying to help, nothing wrong with that. But I really don't think you should have agreed to this, especially with a lack of proper knowledge and without being clear *how* to measure intake. \n\nI'm going with ESH. Your parents for pushing this on you when you don't really know what you're doing to be helpful in this particular case (it's not like asking for gym exercise advice). You because you didn't give your brother the correct information on how to effectively measure intake, and seeing as you have agreed to take responsibility, that's on you. And your brother a bit because while it's sort of on him for not doing his own research as well, he didn't need to lash out at you.", "NTA. \n\nHe was reacting to his own frustration. You specifically got his agreement that he wanted to do this. You clarified the steps, but he fudged them thinking he could cheat the system. You can\u2019t. This is him being upset at the situation or himself. It was just easier to blame you.", "NTA, but OP, I didn\u2019t notice you addressing anything besides cardio and calorie deprivation. Granted, I am not a trainer or a premed, but as I understand it, concentrating on calorie deprivation instead of the quality of your food is a recipe for an eating disorder. Did you show your brother the difference between 200 calories of pizza and 200 calories of eggs, or show him examples of high fat/low carb or low fat/high carb diets so he can make an informed decision? Most fitness apps/basic diets I\u2019ve seen recommend anywhere from 1200-1500 calories a day but I\u2019m pretty sure anything less than 2000 a day technically puts your body into starvation mode, which isn\u2019t sustainable and doesn\u2019t lead to lasting body changes. It might be worth it to focus less on the amount of food he\u2019s eating and more on the psychology of making healthier food choices.\n\nETA: I really love the podcast \u201cMaintenance Phase\u201d and they have some really good episodes on the history of BMI and how it was developed, and the way lobbying led to the food pyramid, and just lots of different fad diets.

I've been chubby all my life but it got much worse in puberty and around the age of 13 I stopped competitive figure skating due to a mystery chronic pain condition and I eventually also had to give up advanced downhill skiing because of the pain as well as walking my dog.

I've got IBS which restricts my diet which narrows my options for example: premade gluten free bread or other baked foods are not necessarily lower calorie or low sugar. I've got PCOS and I've been on birth control since the age of 16. PCOS causes weight gain but so can birth control. I've got severe ADHD and impulse control issues so I do struggle not to eat extra or snack or not be mindful while eating despite being on medication. I have generalized anxiety disorder and undiagnosed chronic depression and I take antidepressants which can cause weight gain. I have sleeping disturbances like chronic nightmares and restless leg syndrome and occasionally insomnia or my ADHD keeps me up which messes up my sleep schedule and my whole day's schedule so I don't eat at regular times as a result. I have some genetic factors working against me as well, there is obesity in my extended family and from my grandparents, depression runs strong in one side of my family from my grandmother and great grandmother and although I am still thankfully not diagnosed with type 2 diabetes- it runs on both sides of my families. I also have debilitating chronic pain conditions that make everyday life difficult and therefore I live a very inactive lifestyle. I am unemployed and I can stay in my apartment for weeks at a time so long as I have enough groceries.

Instead, when people are told to eat less of things that causes insulin to spike (like sugar/carbs), that works a lot better.
