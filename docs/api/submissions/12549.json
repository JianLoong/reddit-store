I live with a college friend (24F) and she agreed when I asked if we could take them in.\n\nInitially, it was a favor for their family. I was happy to help. But I became really attached to them, and they became very attached to me. One cat has a little trouble peeing all the way in the litterbox, and sometimes peed where she wasn\u2019t supposed to, she was adjusting to a new environment and a new mom after 13 years. But I always clean up after them and feed them, and I am solely financially responsible for them. She isn\u2019t allergic, and we had them for three months when we renewed our lease for 2yrs.\n\nNow, they\u2019re acclimated & docile, still very curious. My roommate complained about them from time to time, so I made adjustments accordingly so they wouldn\u2019t get cat food or litter everywhere.\n\nTwo nights ago, she gave me an ultimatum: it\u2019s me or your cats.\n\nI sobbed. So offended she even asked me, that she was willing to end our friendship or move out cause two cats were causing her so much mental anguish she feels \u201cunsafe\u201d to be in our apartment.\n\nThat night, I told her that i\u2019m not choosing, it\u2019s a cruel thing to ask, and I\u2018ll move all their stuff to my bedroom, close them in when she\u2019s home, so they\u2019re out of sight & out of mind.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t good enough. She screamed  at me, saying we agreed to be in a domestic partnership and move to a new city together (we are not in a domestic partnership, nor have we ever been in a relationship), and that I have never compromised for her, ever.\n\nI\u2019m not willing to get rid of my pets just so my roommate wants to be my friend again. As far as i\u2019m concerned, she stopped being a friend as soon as she asked that. Like her asking me to quit my job or choose between her or my other friends, unrealistic.\n\nI don\u2019t want her to move out. We\u2019ve been friends for 4yrs. But I\u2019m her best friend, her only one in the city (she pushed away all our other college friends who moved up here) and she is not mine. She has barely treated me like a friend in recent memory.\n\nAll the utilities are in my name, I keep the house clean, I always pay my share of the rent, and my dad is our sole co-signer on the next two years of our lease. Her father could have co-signed too, our financial situations are the same, but he didn\u2019t.\n\nI can\u2019t just get rid of my pets, who i love and care about, and live the next 2yrs with someone I resent, & hate myself even more for sacrificing my values and part of who I am to save a failing friendship, or make her life easier.\n\nI have my own life, desires, a career i love, and other amazing friends. And she\u2019s been unhappy ever since we moved, and nothing I\u2019ve tried to do to help her has made it any better.\n\nOne friend (23M) in particular told me i needed to stand up for myself, that she\u2019s emotionally manipulative, and I\u2019m starting to think he\u2019s right.\n\nEither way, I\u2019ll feel awful.\n\nTL;DR my roommate gave me an ultimatum to try to make me get rid of my pets, and I said no.", "created_utc": 1679083470, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11u247y/aita_for_not_getting_rid_of_my_cats/", "score": 239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or were you clear that you were keeping them forever and now she\u2019s changing her mind afterwards?\n\nI don\u2019t like how your friend brought the topic up and treated you, but if it was presented as a temporary thing, I can see why she\u2019d be mad.\n\nAlso, as an aside, I don\u2019t necessarily agree that the cat not always urinating in the litter box is a small problem.  My husband was transporting a friend\u2019s cat in his car as a favor, and the thing got mad and peed in the carrier, which then got into the carpet.  No matter how much we tried to clean it, using various methods, for *years* afterwards, on a hot day, the rancid smell of ammonia would still waft up from the carpet.  Even the memory of that smell still makes me gag.\n\nThe smell of strong cat pee can linger in objects that you can\u2019t thoroughly wash and clean.   (Linoleum is one thing, carpet is another.). Cat owners get noseblind to it, but if my roommate had a cat that wasn\u2019t always getting to a litter box?  That\u2019s be a dealbreaker for me (and many others).

That doesn't make any sense.\n\nSomething here doesn't add up but it sounds like she drove all of your other friends away so maybe she's just crazy.

Having delusions about the level of your relationship, pushing away your human companions, and now trying to push away your feline companions all sound like she is trying to control and monopolize you. \n\nCould be she's attempting to remove the things from your life that bring you joy because she wants to be the sole thing that brings you joy, meaning she can both control when you feel joyous and when you don't. That's not a healthy dynamic, whether it's a friendship or otherwise.", "NTA\n\nShe does sound manipulative, especially after you said you'd move all the cat stuff to your room.

No matter how much you clean or what sort of cleaners you use, there is always some trace left because it's so concentrated. If the cats have had multiple accidents, chances are it's left a lingering stench in the apartment and you also mention they are having other issues that you've had to work on in your follow up comments.\n\nI am not suggesting that you get rid of the cats. I have rescue animals myself, including older ones I have adopted who have a wide range of interesting behavioral issues. But I also don't think your roommate is being entirely unreasonable either. You clearly adore the cats (as you should!) and think they are the best thing ever. I suspect if we could hear from her, we would get an entirely different version of events, and perhaps the truth is somewhere in the middle.\n\nI think both of you should try to find someone else to take her place on the lease.
