{"id": 21808, "submission_id": "14ve869", "title": "AITA for kicking my sister and her 2 kids out of my house?", "selftext": "So my sister (27) has been staying at my (F 21) house for the last couple of weeks because she's been going through a tough drought at work, she would earn a lot at her college job but recently graduated so....,I have a large enough house courtesy of my husband for her and her boys (m 11 and m 3) to stay. I've had a few issues with her keeping her room and her kids room clean but overall it's been fine.\n\n\nI recently got a chocolate havanese puppy (5 months old) who we'll call coco in this post. Due to me being busy with university I've asked my sister to take him out to the bathroom on days I know I'll be locked in my office working (my husband works overseas). I've also told her that she needs to keep a close eye on what toys her kids leave out and to pick them up due to the fact that coco will try to chew on them and eat them. \n\n\nToday while I was working on a research paper I took a break to get water. When I left my office I could hear my dog coughing and could see him gagging. I immediately looked in his mouth and saw a tiny red ball lodged in his throat. My 3 year old nephew had been throwing the balls from the game \"Hungy Hungry Hippos\" and my dog attempted to swallow one. I was able to remove the ball from his throat however the incident freaked me out and left me very angry at my sister. \n\n\nWe ended up getting into an argument because she thought I was over reacting about what happened. But if I hadn't left my office to get water my dog could have died,  because she wasn't watching her kid and was watching TV instead. She then proceeded to say, \"it wouldn't have mattered if your dumb fucking dog choked on that toy. That mutt doesn't need to be around my kids anyways!\" When she said this it was a turning point for me, I told her that she has 2 months to find an apartment that I'd help with the first 6 months however she would not be welcome back in my house. \n\n\nA few days after this happened she posted about it on her Instagram story, calling me a \"selfish and horrible sister\" for kicking her out of my house. My dad and mom were of course the first ones to call me angry. I was able to calm them down enough to explain what happened to my dog. After I explained they both agreed I was in the right. However, I'm thinking about deactivating my Instagram, my DM's are filled with my sisters friends and her baby daddy calling me an asshole and accusing me of not caring about my nephews.  I was on FaceTime with my husband about this and he had assured me that what I did was correct but I can't help but wonder if I'm being too harsh. \n\n\nI do still plan to help with my nephews education and their basic needs (helping with clothes, food, housing) but I don't think I can stand to have them in my house anymore if their mother isn't going to watch them. I love those boys to pieces but I have no idea if I'm doing the right thing.", "created_utc": 1688947594, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ve869/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_and_her_2_kids_out_of/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That mutt doesn't need to be around my kids anyways!\" \n\nDont give her 6 months man, why should you help her when she does not give a single fuck about your closed ones? \n\nAlso where is Baby daddy when they need a home? \n\nIts kind of you that you want to help the kids with the education and basic needs but make sure that its used for the kids if you do so, your sister seems like and ass. NTA.", "NTA. You are 21 and your sister is 27 with two kids and you are talking about supporting your older sister and her kids? Wtf is this and why would you need to pay for 6 months on an apartment for her? What info is missing?", "NTA, but don't give her 2 months.  Tell her to pack all her stuff up and drive her to her baby daddy's house where he can do what he is supposed to do and take care of the kids.", "Nta at all, you were gracious to give her two months to look for accommodation as she doesn\u2019t especially as she doesn\u2019t seem at all grateful.", "NTA. In any way. And I'm very glad your parents are on your side with this because too many stories here aren't that way.\n\nYour house is no longer one that is well-suited to accommodate for young kids. If your sister wanted to really put in the work to make sure her and her children weren't interfering with that, that would be one thing, but she's clearly demonstrated she doesn't respect you or the space. The whole Insta storm only adds to that.\n\nHonestly 2 months is pretty generous. A lot can go down in 2 months especially if she's feeling petty. I know you want to look out for her (and especially your nephews), but you're already doing more than enough. Make sure you're looking out for yourself and your needs first and foremost, and best of luck.", "You\u2019re giving her 2 months more slack than I would.  NTA", "NTA. I would actually tell her if she wants to rile up a mob against me she can get out immediately and I wouldn\u2019t be offering any financial assistance.", "NTA If your sister agreed to watch the dog she should have been watching it. Also she's a guest at your house and should follow your rules regarding the toys. You're definitely not obligated to even house her especially since it's not entirely our place either.", "NTA, but stop helping. When they leave that\u2019s it. 2 months also seems overly generous.", "NTA. You asked your sister a relatively easy thing. Make sure the kids' toys were out of reach of the dog. She managed to fuck that up by watching TV instead of her kids. And then tell you that you shouldn't have gotten your puppy, in your own home?\n\nNope. You need to kick out the dead weight sooner, than later. I would have given 24 hours or less after the way she sassed you. If she can't show you basic respect in your own home, then she doesn't need to live there. Where is the baby daddy in all this? Shouldn't he be the one to house her?", "Two months? If anyone had talked about my pet like that they\u2019d be lucky to get two minutes.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Why isn't she staying with all the people who think you're an AH???  Anyone who doesn't care if a dog chokes to death is not someone I want to spend time with.  I think giving her two months is incredibly generous!", "NTA. Your house, your rules. And once someone messes with my pets, even indirectly, they would be gone. Permanently.", "NTA - Based on her recent actions of posting about this, I think you have been more than generous in giving her two months to find a new place.", "Why in gods name does she get 2 months after doing this and speaking to you this way? AND you\u2019re helping her financially? My god.", "NTA - She is smug and quick with biting words which earned her lost stable housing and is not welcomed to return. She could have stated 100 different responses but she chose to be crude and entitled. Not a shred of gratitude was or has been conveyed for taking her in, paying 6 months of future rent, etc. Yet, she is laser focused to blast you on social media. Yes, deactivate the noise; they are not interested in the full story anyway.\n\nYou actually gave her 2 months...how about 1 week: Look at places, Pack and Go....give this a thought. Best to you.", "NTA. She's made bad life decisions and is ungrateful, be done with her.", "You're doing the right thing.  \n\nYour sister is a guest in your home.  She doesn't have to put your dog at risk; it's very easy not to put her at risk; but she has chosen to behave in ways that were almost fatal to your dog and will continue to do so.  She has also tried to destroy your reputation online, drawing friends and relative into it.\n\nGet her out of there.  Right now.  Gone.\n\nLet her stay with your parents, or the father of her children, or his parents.  I don't care if she doesn't want to or there isn't enough space; if she wanted to stay in your house, she should have treated you with kindness and gratitude, and not been completely indifferent (if not positively enthused) when your dog was choking.\n\nIf none of the above is viable, and if you're able to pay for a temporary dwelling for her for a couple of months, starting tomorrow, do that.  You shouldn't have to have a person in  your home (or in your life, for that matter)  who treats you like this, who not only isn't grateful for the help you and your husband are offering, but who is disrespectful and hostile, tries to shame you publicly, and is into entitled manipulation.\n\nYou could also try to hook her up with Social Services to see what kind of low cost temporary or permanent housing is available to women in her financial situation in your municipality. (This should be her job, but given that she can mooch off you while treating you like dirt, why should she lift one entitled finger?)\n\nOut, out, out!!!\n\nNTA.", "You are 21 with a house?

How is OP an AH when clearly they are not really her responsibility.  It seems like she was doing g a courtesy letting them stay. I would however suggest you have something in writing with a date for her to leave. I'm not sure where you are located, but it will be a pain of she refuses to leave and has established residency.
