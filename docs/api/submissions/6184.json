We have decided to wait three months before telling wider family and friends, but we phoned our respective parents and siblings as soon as we found out so we could share the news. His family were thrilled, our baby will be the second grandbaby on their side and they are so pleased that the family is growing. My parents, on the other hand, were excited enough when my husband was on the call with us, but phoned me afterwards to express their disappointment.\n\nFor context, my parents (M68 and F66) have never really loved the idea of my sister (F30) or I having children at all. When I was little, I was always told to chase my dreams and that children got in the way of that. I was encouraged to not settle down until I had achieved all of my academic and career goals, and was always fed information about how children are so expensive and they ruin a woman's future. My parents were absolutely devastated when I got married at 25, they told me that I had thrown everything away for a man. Related side note, my mom dropped out of her Bachelor's degree (at age 21) so she could marry my dad, have me a few years later, and become a SAHM. She always told me how much she gave up and how much she regrets doing that.\n\nNow I am 32, I have a PhD and a job that I love, but I also really want a family. My husband and I just bought a home and we are ready. He and I have spoken about a family for so long, and I am so excited to be able to have all of that.\n\nWhen my parents phoned to express their disappointment, they told me how worried they are about me. They told me that this was never what I had spoken about as a little girl, and they were worried my husband was pushing his ideas and dreams of a family onto me. They told me that this little baby would be the end of my career, and that my life now would be impossibly difficult to manage. They said that they did not think that I had put enough thought into this, and overall that this was not what they wanted for me.\n\nI was so upset, I told them that I was stable with a loving husband and a family is what I wanted. They wouldn't listen and kept saying that this was not the little girl that they raised. Eventually I just lost it and screamed at them to leave us alone and that they need to mind their own business. My mom reacted as if I had shot her, and hung up. I later received a message from my mom saying that she knows she made a lot of mistakes in her life and didn't want me to repeat them.\n\nI was so furious, and I feel like such a happy moment for my husband and I was ruined. My sister had been with my parents when the fight happened, and she texted to tell me that my parents only wanted what was best for me, and that I shouldn't have reacted so strongly. She said our mom just doesn't want me to give up on any dreams. I feel a bit like a jerk, but I also want to have a family and I think that that is reasonable.

Your mother is in need of some therapy to deal with HER regrets. Your problems are not hers. Her behaviour is awful and quite frankly, I'd be having second thoughts about speaking to her or allowing her involvement in your lives at all. You cannot be expected to maintain the same ideas you had when you were a child. That's stupid. And anyone who thinks that needs their head read. If that was the case then I'd quite literally be a Princess Archaeologist.\nCongratulations on your little one!xxxxx", "So very, very NTA.  Your mom wants to live vicariously through you, and is more interested in the life she\u2019s imagined for you than in the reality of what makes you happy.  It also sounds like she\u2019s completely blind to what you *have* achieved in life, which is impressive.  \nCongratulations on your pregnancy, and enjoy the new family you are making with your husband.", "NTA. If this is what you want, your parents should be happy for you. Not telling you how much you being born \"ruined their life\" maybe they'll come around, maybe not. Regardless, it sounds like something I wouldn't want my kid around if it happened to me.", "NTA. You were blindsided by the lecture.  Mom and dad are TA because they failed to appreciate that you had achieved all of your educational goals and are ready to expand your horizons.   You expected them to know all of that.  In hindsight, we can all recall moments that we would prefer to have handled differently.  Give yourself a break.  If you feel it's appropriate, apologize to them.   But, do not try to explain because it will result in a renewed conversation.  If they try to bring up the cause of the disagreement again, don't engage.  Say clearly and firmly that you know what their position is and that you aren't interested in discussing it any further.  You are the decider.   Only you can know if an apology for your outburst is appropriate.   Happy New Year.", ">When I was little, I was always told . . . that children got in the way . . . \n\nWhat the hell kind of thing is that to say to your child? What is wrong with them?\n\nIf you were dropping out like your mom did, I\u2019d urge you to reconsider. But you have a PhD and a great job and a much wanted baby on the way. Nice work! Definitely NTA.", "NTA this is something that you want. Your parents taught you to go after what YOU want. It sounds as though you are in a good position in life. Congratulations on your pregnancy. Your baby is incredibly lucky to have parents like you and your husband.", "NTA. Your parents reaction was ridiculous and completely ignored your wishes for yourself and your life. I suspect they would have kept blathering on if you hadn\u2019t reacted as you did.  Please don\u2019t let them take your joy.", "NTA. Comments by your parents are plain awful. You should not say such things to any woman, but especially not to a married one who wants the child.\n\nYes, life with the child is hard(er) than without them. But so is life with a cat or dog... I have stopped doing a lot of things after having a child, but I have to admit that most of it is due to my own fears and lazyness. Life actually does not stop and you just discover your new superpowers.", "NTA Parents were obviously projecting their feelings onto you. It is so sad that they feel that way, and then to express those thoughts and feelings to their OWN CHILD? Wow...I have no words.  You are DOING RIGHT by living YOUR life. It is not their choice, their life nor even THEIR FEELINGS that matter here, it is your decision. I am really sorry they can't be happy for you, but you have to allow them to be who they are. Whether you want to risk letting your child/ren grow up listening to their weird ideas is also your choice, but I'd personally advise against unsupervised contact since they don't really like children very much.", "32 with a PhD is a very good age to have a child or two. Your parents are projecting their issues onto you. Tell them to get back to you after they've gone to therapy.", "NTA. Your mom is projecting some of her regrets about life decisions she made onto you and your life. I was able to get married, further my education and raise a child while going to school and working. Live your best life! It was her decision to drop out of school and stay at home with her child. Your decision may very well be different... nothing says that you can't have a career and a family. Your mom should be thrilled for you and I am sorry that her response was so disappointing. But those are her issues, not yours to deal with. Congratulations and best of luck with everything!", "NTA you ARE chasing your dreams. It's 100% possible to have a successful career and have the joy of a child or children in your life. Your parents constant negative pushing wrongly reinforces the idea you are the mistake in their life. Break the cycle and never let your child ever feel that way. Congrats on your blessing! I hope your parents have a change of heart when they finally meet your new bundle of joy.", "Your mom's concerns are valid. However, you are not a 21yo girl in college.\n\nYou are an accomplished 32yo woman, and you (and your husband) want to have a child. \n\nYour parents are projecting on you.

I hope you have a smooth pregnancy and an easy delivery! \ud83d\udc96\n\nNTA", "NTA. You chose to form a family AFTER chasing a PHD and a job you like... you kinda fulfilled your parents' expectations. You are not obligated to  live your life as your Mom deems right.", "Wow this made me sad. The way I read this is that your parents basically have been telling you and your sister since childhood that you ruined their lives. If you haven\u2019t already, I would really recommend working to unpack that in therapy.\n\nObviously NTA. They are trying to control your life and decisions and are being very mean and cruel. You did nothing wrong. If they can\u2019t respect you, they shouldn\u2019t expect you to keep contact with them. Intent doesn\u2019t matter, what they said and did was mean and disrespectful.\n\nCongratulations on your baby, I\u2019m so happy for you two!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
