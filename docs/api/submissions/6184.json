When I was little, I was always told to chase my dreams and that children got in the way of that. I was encouraged to not settle down until I had achieved all of my academic and career goals, and was always fed information about how children are so expensive and they ruin a woman's future. My parents were absolutely devastated when I got married at 25, they told me that I had thrown everything away for a man. Related side note, my mom dropped out of her Bachelor's degree (at age 21) so she could marry my dad, have me a few years later, and become a SAHM. She always told me how much she gave up and how much she regrets doing that.\n\nNow I am 32, I have a PhD and a job that I love, but I also really want a family.

They wouldn't listen and kept saying that this was not the little girl that they raised. Eventually I just lost it and screamed at them to leave us alone and that they need to mind their own business. My mom reacted as if I had shot her, and hung up. I later received a message from my mom saying that she knows she made a lot of mistakes in her life and didn't want me to repeat them.\n\nI was so furious, and I feel like such a happy moment for my husband and I was ruined. My sister had been with my parents when the fight happened, and she texted to tell me that my parents only wanted what was best for me, and that I shouldn't have reacted so strongly.

In hindsight, we can all recall moments that we would prefer to have handled differently.  Give yourself a break.  If you feel it's appropriate, apologize to them.

They can't even see potential predators until they're too close for safety, let alone run or walk away from them. As a parent your job is help them learn all about this huge wide world we live in. Starting with learning to trust you, to be safe with you, and then slowly building up so that they understand wider family, the neighbourhood, the town, the country, and then the world.\n\nYou raise them to hopefully be a good person. To learn about the magic of books, of nature, the joy of music and dancing, or the simple pleasures of a good meal and a warm bath. Of course there will be tantrums and tears along the way and some days you'll question if it was such a good idea. But there will also be massive highs to go with those lows.\n\nYour Mum didn't find this fulfilling, and that's a shame for her. Maybe she had undiagnosed PPD, maybe she had traumatic births, or maybe motherhood was never really for her and she didn't realise it until it was too late. But that doesn't mean that you will feel the same way. I'm 27 weeks pregnant at the moment, and while I'm worried about the state of the world and what kind of parent I'll be, I'm also excited to see what kind of small human I'm bringing into it. There are plenty of parents who find joy and happiness in raising their little ones to adulthood before launching them into the world, and they do it while achieving other personal goals as well.\n\nDon't let your Mum's attitude sour this period and this news for you.

I remember one older gentleman who was in my department when I did my undergrad.

He'd always wanted to study the field I was in but law had been a more secure career path. He decided to follow his dream, just at a more advanced age.\n\nSince then the idea that university/college is only for 18 year olds has reduced markedly, and there's now more mature students than ever going into degrees. Some want a career change after the pandemic, or want to get a promotion at work, but some genuinely just want to expand their knowledge and learn more, particularly in fields like computer science and the life sciences, where significant advances have been made in the past decade or two. Even a few advanced or further education courses might help Mum find the fulfillment she feels she's missing.", "Potentially, but it was never framed in that way for us. I was just always told about the perils of being a working woman with a child/children. The message never seemed to come from a place of grief, although that might be influencing the message.

This was my biggest take away because I've been in a similar spot with my mom. You sound like you have it all to be honest, and I hope you can enjoy your pregnancy.", "Trying to say this as gently as possible because losing a child is heartbreaking\u2026your brother was born when your mum was 21/22, died when she was 27/28, you were born when she was 34. \n\nI don\u2019t think being a working mother was the sole reason for her not meeting her career goals. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to provide a different reason though (and of course, this may not have anything to do with it but it seems odd to place all the blame on being a working mother and not even give a passing mention to the impact of suffering such a significant trauma)"]}
