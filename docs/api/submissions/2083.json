No contact after the above, she has literally shown what kind of friend she is, and someone who makes you feel guilty about not giving them money, is not a friend you should ever want or have\n4. Protect yourself.  I see other posts here about this kind of thing, and honestly, not a bad idea (Concealed carry, mace, whatever)\n5. That kid is much better off not being around her at this time.  If she doesn't have her shit together now, giving her $30k will not help.  She needs to work on this on her own or she won't really be doing what she needs to take care of herself\n6. If it was that big of an issue that she needed to pay people back, then she can leave town and go live in the same state/city as her grandparents, she is only trying to use you to get free money.\n7. Regardless of if you can afford it, it is not your responsibility.  She made her mistakes and she needs to take care of them or figure something out.  Not your problem!\n8. You should not feel guilty about this at all.  I would not expect a family member, let alone a friend to give me $30k.  Again, this is not your issue to deal with.  If you give her $30k now, she will probably ask for another $30k in the future, or more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck to you.", "Put the word out that the money is tied up in some way (e.g. trust) that it is not accessible to you.", "You must stop talking about the money. Do not share this info with anyone. I would cut ties with all of these people because it sounds like they all think they \u2018deserve\u2019 some of your money. I say that because decent people would never think what she\u2019s doing is ok, let alone agree that you should give her this money (unless they want some too). NTA. If you can move, definitely think about it.", "This isn't your problem. She made her own mistakes and is showing no signs of maturing or taking responsibility. She found out you have money and sees you as an easy way out of her own mess. NTA", "Yeah I doubt that is actually going to happen. I say cut ties with her and go on living your best life.", "Yeah no. Someone who was reckless in the first place will lose that money. Do not give it to her.\n\nAlso, the friends who are trying to guilt trip you, tell them they collectively can pay off her debts for her. You don\u2019t owe her or them anything.\n\nAlso they aren\u2019t you friends. Find better friends.\n\nNTA", "Nta and you need to find out who  shared such personal information about you and stop talking to them. They but you in a very bad position. Desperate people can do unthinkable things to people they say they care about.please be careful.", "Off the top of my head, you'll want your phone set up so you can trigger an emergency and call 911.  Android does this by hitting the power button enough times; iPhones should have something similar.\n\nOutside of that, Mace/Pepper Spray and a lot of \ud83d\ude4f\n\nIn the future, be more careful with who knows you have money.\n\nBodyguards are good but they cost money.", "I would personally be moving and going no contact. People who owe money to bad people are desperate, and in the interests of protecting their families desperate people can justify some pretty horrible things to others.  If I were you I would never be able to let go of the paranoia that she would settle her own debts by giving someone the opportunity to go after a bigger fish - you - with information she might be able to provide.", "Tell her you spent it on hookers and blow", "Move. Don\u2019t tell anyone what you\u2019re doing. Just pack up some stuff (& pets if any) & bolt. You can always buy more clothes, furniture, etc.", "Yes, I\u2019m forming as of now. I\u2019ve thought about finding other accommodations, but everything is packed in the city. I\u2019ve already paid for this semester\u2019s room and board as well. \n\nI learned it the hard way. I will NEVER tell anyone I know about my money again.", "Thank you for this long ass comment. Thank you. It\u2019s all that\u2019s being said and more. It\u2019s all this clarity but structured I guess? I\u2019m screenshotting this.", "Yah. Maybe say you can\u2019t access it without your parents say so, or, like others have suggested, that it\u2019s in a trust.", "Thank you for this advice. I truly mean it.", "What do the little hands after \"mace/pepper spray\" signify? Like learning martial arts or something?", "Lmfao. Noted", "I\u2019m at college. I cant leave. I worked so hard to get into this college.", "My bad. Dorming*", "It's November so most of the semester is over. Move over Christmas break.", "OP if you can maybe consult with a lawyer and see what options they can suggest. Unfortunately I doubt the police will be able to help at this stage but the gist is make sure you are raising the alarm to people who can help keep you safe. Maybe building security?", "Hey, you live and learn! This is a life lesson that you won\u2019t forget. \n\nMaybe come up with an excuse about how inaccessible the money is. Maybe pretend like you lied a bit and bragged about the amount or when you can actually access the funds. Things like that. \nMake sure to only go out with a group of people (not your current \u201cfriends\u201d). \nDon\u2019t go out drinking for a few weeks / months. \nBuy some security devices for your dorm. \n\nNot really sure what to suggest that\u2019s realistic but things like that to make you feel safe(r) for the time being. \n\nAnd then this should too go away.", "prayer", "I believe their saying to pray or hope for what's best.", "Then go NC on everyone. Someone you told told her, so you can\u2019t trust anyone. Finish up school & bolt.", "Oh. That seems like a terrible idea, but okay.", "Easier said than done \ud83d\ude2d 2 years left", "different people have different perspectives, I guess :)  Not my first choice of proactive measures either."]}
