New girl might not know about the girlfriend, she might have been lied to, etc. OP should absolutely tell the girlfriend AND the new girl, advise them the son is a cheater, and that they should get themselves to the clinic for a full panel. For crying out loud, this is basic sex ed.", "I don't get how this is so downvoted. Like, I get wanting to call out the son, but man that's a good way to lose your son and have him go NC on you. Particularly doing it in such an obvious way as proposed.", "Cheating is the asshole move.", "Not at all, the little shit deserves it and maybe it\u2019ll show him to treat people with respect", "Never met one before with absolutely no brains or balls though.", "Maybe not good sense in the way of how to do things properly, but I expect a somewhat functional moral compass.", "Hey don't lump this guy in with the rest of us smh. The majority of us have one gf.", "Mom is responsible for instilling good values in her child and correcting him when he does something wrong. The son is barely out of teenage years but not too young to learn a lesson. Being a cheater is definitely something that should be discouraged.", "She doesnt have to be a willing accomplice either.... Say she mistakenly calls the girl the wrong name???? Whoops", "wasn't saying she was", "Yes, because who HE can trust is the biggest concern in this situation. Not the girl being cheated on, not the girl being cheated with, not the parent witnessing first hand that lack of trustworthiness of their own child.\n\nNever mind the safety implications. What if the girlfriend wakes up with some disease her cheater boyfriend picked up? But no, not breaking his trust by enabling consequences for his actions takes precedence.\n\nThis is how you raise narcissists.", "I mean you cant trust the kid either so whats the matter\ud83e\udd37", "Lmao if you're gonna end your relationship with someone bc they exposed you for your dishonesty, looks far worse on you than them", "Well, If OP is in country where law provides minimum level of protection of tenants, this may be important as her sound would legally be a tenant. Not approving of his lifestyle wouldn't be a sufficient reason for eviction. At least here, where I live.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Lol. \ud83d\udc4d", "Going to go out on a limb and assume you have never parented a teenager.", "Because it\u2019s a good way to have him abandon his mother and never tell her anything again. This kid is still a teenager in his head, and having his mom rat him out will just ruin the trust between them. So when someone severe is going on, the last person he\u2019ll tell is his mom. Plus, most people simply don\u2019t appreciate being told they\u2019re being cheated on. I told my buddy\u2019s girlfriend, somehow I became the asshole and she started talking bad about me and never spoke to me again. Happened with multiple people. You tell them, you\u2019re worse than the guy cheating on them.", "Is that such a bad thing? If you've already failed at parenting to where your child is a horrible human, maybe non-contact is a plus.", "Because as a parent your job is raising a respectful young person. If making them face the consequences of their actions in a controlled environment is enough to make them go NC they are either horribly ungrateful and spoiled in which case op failed at raising their child or there is something else that seriously fractured the relationship first and this is the snowflake that caused the avalanche.", "I also don't see why it's so downvoted, but I'm more worried that it's cruel to the girlfriend (rather than to the son). OP has known her for 2+ years and presumably likes her. OP should tell her because she deserves to know. OP should not tell her LIKE THAT because that's pretty callous.\n\n(Seeing as they're 18, I hope the girlfriend didn't change her college plans or anything to stay with this cheater.)", "I'm not sure if he has no balls.  The dumbass is just trying to have his cake and eat it too and is pissed off that Mommy is calling him out on his shit.", "You would think, but the teenage years are extremely egocentric.  I'm again not defending what he's doing, but looking at developmental psychology, it's also not surprising he's doing something stupid and selfish.", "Say it a little louder, for those in the back.", "Im not talking about whats right, im stating the facts", "Right? What a warped way of thinking.", "We allready established the son is an asshole, i dont see how this comment is relevant", ">...most people simply don\u2019t appreciate being told they\u2019re being cheated on.\n\nThis is simply incorrect.", "That's a risk the mom should take. If son is sexually active with gf and with this new one, GF deserves to know, as son is literally risking her life in lying about exclusivity. \n\nOP should tell him, \"what you do in your personal life is your business, yes, but in doing this here, you are now asking me to lie for you, even if by omission. I taught you to be honest and to give people respect and you are disrespecting both these girls and ME. Tell the truth to them or I will.\"", "he didn't tell her in the first place.  he lied.", "Saying they \"already failed\" seems a bit harsh to me. Not every bad move a child makes means the parent \"failed.\" OP is trying to force the son to take responsibility. That seems like a good parental move to me.", "Ideally, OP should get the son to come clean.", "So many cheating apologists in this thread.", "it is also facts that who HE trusts in this situation doesn't matter. The safety of all involved takes precedence over his broken trust.", "It furthers the point that loosing a child like that ain't worth crying over. People will understand and think the son's an idiot, not any weight on the parents shoulders.", "Is not just that the kid is cheating that makes me say the parents failed. It's also the blatant disrespect and attitude of complete entitlement when confronted with being caught.  If the kid lacks empathy, morals, respect, and common decency, then yes, I think the parents already failed.", "Agreed, but sounds like he's determined to be the asshole in this situation, so I doubt he'll go for that. (And forcing him with an ultimatum would definitely be a great way to have him go NC, which was your previous concern.) It's a no-win situation for sure, but SOMEBODY needs to tell the girlfriend.", "That is not a fact, that is an opinion, you are not really good at words\n\n\n\nI am not saying that tho, im saying that the reason why the parent might think about revealing this is that it may ruin their relationship with thieir child", "The weight is not what other people think...", "Kids have thoughts and make their own choices. He's 18, not 8.", "Like you said though, it's \"when confronted with being caught.\" It's common behavior when a person doesn't want to face consequences for their actions, regardless of the age. The parent's job is to show there are consequences for bad behavior. The only way OP \"fails\" is to do nothing at all.", "let me put it simpler, so my not really good words get through your thick skull: \n\nsafety > personal feelings\n\nhow is that an opinion and not a fact, baffles the mind.\n\nas for your other point, fair", "When you have raised a lying cheating asshole of a son, setting them straight is the least you can do. And if the son doesn't want contact after that, that's not a loss for the mother.", "Sure, the mom will probably think it's sad loosing contact with her son.But any decent person would still do what's right, and call out the son.  \nHow he reacts to that isn't up to her, and shouldn't affect her actions.", "For you, for me, for all of us strangers \n\n\nFor op tho....", "You are applying logic to illogical feelings, i doubt a mother would be as much accepting of no contact", "Then she's not very bright. If the son doesn't want contact, then that's his choice. But the risk of that shouldn't affect her parenting.  \nImagine if every parent just let their children do whatever they want because they are afraid for their children?   \nAnd flip it; would the mother want the mother of his girlfriend to tell her son if she was cheating on the son?", "Repeating the same error twice"]}
