But I don't love the attitude here. Why is your wife's time with the kids less special or important because she is a homemaker and not running a national business? Why shouldn't she get special treats with the kids? I'm sure you're not consciously thinking that way, but that's how it comes across. You should also be setting budget priorities together (ahead of time, to avoid issues like this), why are you allowed to veto her choices?", "Sure, but NYC -> Chicago requires you to cover the Great Lakes and isn\u2019t a straight-shot to drive; Scottsdale, AZ -> Orange County is about 6 hours drive give or take with no major geographic features in the way. Like I said though, I\u2019m poor and grew up doing 5-7+ hour road trips to go anywhere fun so I have an entirely different perspective on it.", ">We flew back American first class on that trip. I did take flack over that.\n\nYou took flack from your wife for flying first class instead of private? For real?", "OP, I want to jump in and say that the issue seems less like the private jet and more like the difference in standards here.\n\nFor a trip you're on, you pay an employee to drive your cars out instead of dealing with the hassle of a rental, and flew back first class.\n\nFor a trip your wife is going on with your son (for his birthday, which you aren't attending for some reason???), you're suggesting they fly the crappiest flight possible.\n\nI don't think that flying private to go to Disney is necessary, but I also don't think that you paying your employees to semi-chauffeur you or flying back first class is necessary, but you're only going for the unnecessary luxuries when you're present.", "Well his time is more valuable if he\u2019s netting private plane money.", "Right? I don't understand all the response for N T A coming in when this part is stated there.", "Yeah I need to get off of Reddit. I agree, he\u2019s the AH for being unwilling to go on public for himself, but quite frankly I just wanna say ESH because anyone who uses a private jet seems like an AH to me. I live without running water and this family is bickering over flying a private jet to Disney land. Oh what a life to live that these are your problems.", "Generally, taking private flights for any reason emits way more CO2 per passenger that a larger flight. Even with that being the case, driving or using literally any other public transit, if available, emits less emissions than flying. \n\nI agree that taking the southwest flight is better than private but driving would emit way less emissions", "Yeah, I had to get past the \"let's hate rich people\" reflex to answer. I did though. Lol", "Skeptical about employee transport but whatever, enjoy the ride.  Stay home, bake a cake from scratch.", "Stay on topic Dominic", "Don't worry, I only stalk parttime lol. You had mentioned 3 kids in a comment, not on the post.", "Ummm did you forget their destination is Disney??? They\u2019re going to be crammed like cattle cars with people from everywhere in the world who just flew through the busiest airports in the world. \n\nThe exposure argument is a joke when the destination is an international petry dish.", "I dunno. My friend flew semi-private this holiday and it was just a regular airplane with different security procedures (faster & more concierge-like)\u2014 but the airplane itself was just as crowded. And then the hostess got pissed at them because her kid left crushed chips on the seat so they were banned from the return flight. They got stranded for days until they could re-book on another airline.\n\nI would not fly semi-private with kids for that reason, it seems they\u2019re aiming for the \u201cluxury\u201d market and are hoping to keep kids out.", "Southwest is a perfectly good airline. The majority of the time it works well. Cheaper tickets and often less delays then United and such.", "The recent Christmas situation was an outlier. They\u2019re fine.", "Also, you can see a load of fab stuff on the way. A 6 hour drive could be split up with a stop somewhere cool and then spend the money saved from not flying on a stop in a Disney hotel (which make your eyes water they are so expensive). Makes a trip not just about Disney but also seeing different places too.", "Oh no. I paid the employee because (1) rental over the holiday is crazy expensive and (2) my wife and her mom pack so many suitcases that it\u2019s embarrassing. :-)", "People are projecting their own issues and biases on their responses way more often than necessary.", "Your post was so clearly biased that it was less about the situation and more about your personal jealousy. You changed the topic and I called you out on it.", "I mean, regardless of whether it's cheaper to pay an employee, the matter of fact is that it's a personal favor that adds luxury and decreases hassle from your trip that you do not appear to be offering to your wife (and, again, you're skipping your son's birthday party? Probably another issue there).", "Not really, ESH here including you.", "We got a hater"]}
