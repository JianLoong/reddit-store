Companies usually want to deduct the cost of employees\u2019 personal flights on their aircraft as a business expense.

Instead, FAA regulations permit the employee in some cases to \u201ctime share\u201d an aircraft for an amount equal to twice the actual fuel costs, plus certain stated expenses. \n\nIf you fly a corporate jet and take you spouse or family on the trip with you, it\u2019s considered fringe benefit,\n\n> In general, a taxable fringe benefit is included in the income of the person performing the services, even though that person may not have been the direct recipient of the benefit. For example, if a fringe benefit is provided to an employee\u2019s spouse it is considered as provided to the employee and is included in the employee\u2019s wages because a fringe benefit that is provided in connection with the provision of services is considered compensation for those services.
