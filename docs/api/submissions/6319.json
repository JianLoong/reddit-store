Also five years old is too young to understand that the rejection isn\u2019t because of her but rather something her parent\u2019s been through. A five year old will take it personally. Very soft YTA OP, and I\u2019d strongly suggest that you do what this commenter suggested, but also maybe some therapy so that you can learn how to cope with it.\n\nPeople with trauma can have kids, but they shouldn\u2019t until they\u2019ve learned to deal with it enough that they don\u2019t project it onto them. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll inadvertently end up traumatizing them, too. I am saying this from experience because both my parents grew up in bad households. But because they didn\u2019t hit me or beat me for being \u201ctoo autistic\u201d and only did verbal abuse or starved me for having sensory issues, they didn\u2019t see it as abuse. Obviously that\u2019s more extreme but it\u2019s still the same general principle. Plenty of parents who\u2019ve been traumatized are excellent parents, but you can\u2019t be the type of parent a child deserves when you yourself have not dealt with your issues for your own sake. If your child was old enough to understand that it wasn\u2019t personal this would be totally different, but five is too young to comprehend that it\u2019s not her fault.", "I\u2019ve just read your other comments. YTA. Be better. Your dad did this to you. Doesn\u2019t mean you should do it to your daughter. Do you believe you\u2019d be a better dad if you showed your daughter physical affection, or do you honestly believe it adds nothing to your relationship? If you have limitations that prevent you from being the best you can be, a good parent works on that, they don\u2019t inflict them on their child.", "He\u2019s absolutely not a wonderful father.

I read about a man and wife where the wife was always upset about how unaffectionate her husband was. Then she taught him this little way to say I love you... Which is you squeeze someone's hand 3 times. And suddenly he was saying he loves her ALL the time.\n\nOp, your delivery was terrible. But you should go back to your daughter, explain your side of it, and come up with some other fun way you two can show affection to each other.", "This, 100% this. If hugs make you too uncomfortable, come up with something like a handshake! Baby steps, maybe eventually you'll be able to hug her.", "Nah he's 100% the asshole for not wanting hugs FROM HIS OWN DAUGHTER. It doesn't matter how uncomfortable it makes you, if your kid needs a hug, you fucking hug them", "He's still a total AH for how he handled it.", "I hate being touched so I understand.

Everyone else in the comments seem to think you\u2019d have to be a monster not to want hugs JC.", "Most of the YTA are not about his \"bodily autonomy\". They are about the way the rejection was given. You expect a child to tell \"I'm never ever ever doing this\". You also expect an adult to explain about personal levels of comfort and how they are all about them, not the person trying to be affectionate. OP had 5 years to decide how to talk to his daughter about his problem, yet chose the *worst way* YTA", "So the daughter is TA for wanting a hug from her dad? Your judgment says that there is at least one AH but it\u2019s not the poster", "I think it's one thing if you don't receive physical affection from either parent since this normalises the situation, setting expectations etc but in this case where the mother is showering physical affection on the child but the father refuses it there is a divide and children tend to jump to dramatic conclusions.", "Op being thankful that his wife didnt hear their daughter crying was a gut punch, too. Oh that poor baby crying herself to sleep", "Me too, it actually made me feel a bit sick to my stomach reading it. What a cold and heartless thing to say to your own child.", "Right?

YTA.", "Turkey baster?", "If someone has some sort of phobia related to affection, absolutely, they need to seek therapy.  I'm still leaning toward OP being TA, because he should realise this, as should his wife.  I wonder if he shows affection with others.  If it is just his child who he does not want to hug, that is scary to me and I hope he gets therapy asap.", "Agreed. OP please seek therapy. \n\nI grew up with a father that was about appearances and not affection. All us kids loved him but as we grew up he was so distant\u2026 to the point he ended up favouring his new step family over us (they appeared as grown up functional teens to adults so no child raising had to happen). At his funeral it was all about the step family and they all had the chance to speak, none of his kids were invited\u2026 I had sat/slept by his hospital bed for every minute of the last week so he wasn\u2019t alone. \n\nIt not only hurts as a five year old. It hurts after they leave. \n\nPlease OP, go to therapy so you can work through whatever it is that you need to so you can show affection to your daughter.
