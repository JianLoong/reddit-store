You're having one night stands but that's somehow taking away his opportunity to date girls? If he was really not interested in \"sluts\" or one nighters then he'd have no reason to be jealous of you. But clearly he is, he just can't get any bc he's a bitter incel that no one wants.

He uses strong incel language, and quite a few of those people have turned into mass shooters. There are a few mass shooters literally revered in those communities.
