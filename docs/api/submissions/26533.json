What makes them unattractive is either their personality, or the fact that they're visible because they spend all day inside.

I'm also quite able with wording and talking and more than once I stole the attention of a girl from guys like OP and brought them with me. It's all a subtle game of catching what interests them, making some fun jokes, then comes the physical part when you start playfully making contact and it's done, the other is out and you're in for a one night stand. The satisfaction in catching all those litte microexpression and unnoticeable body language marks of disbelief and discouragement in those \"cool guys\" when a nerdy guy stole the scene from them... it was delightful. And I tasted every second of it and they are still vivid in my memory with great pleasure.\n\nThat of course, if the other \"player\" or \"f\\*ckboy\", as \"Simon\" calls them, isn't more attractive than you by far or the girl has total interes in him since the beginning. At that point is a lost battle and I move onto the next one. No male fucks with me anyway (in the meaning of being hostile, this time, not for the one night stand ahah) because I literally look like a bull, so it's easy to be cocky in front of them.\n\nDon't be annoying and accept it. My life has been that of \"Simon\", and those dudes deserves it.\n\nIf you want to do a favor to \"Simon\", just convince him to quit videogames and computers, they literally fry your brain and social skills.For me the change started as a challenge to myself.I achieved a lot in life but not in social skills and social life.So I had to know if it was a problem with me or that the world and people are slimy useless beings.\n\nTurned out it was the second.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTE: I was on my way to sign up for university, so I had a lot of free time and no job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was the actions I took that led me to being able to build my best social life in 2 months, meaning that 2 months are the preparation period to start building it up, not that in 2 months you're the most popular guy.Stopped gaming and all digital activity. The maximum I stayed on computer was 1 hour per week if I needed it. The rest was whatsapp or other social to keep in touch with people.\n\nStarted going out with everyone I knew at every slight occasion, no question asked, they say do you want to... and I was already saying yes.If they weren't proactive in it, I was asking them to go out to do anything I could think of.Literally everyone.In the rare cases no one was available, I spent all my time reading books and most importantly watching the same tv shit they were watching and reading articles about what they were following and watching, about my interests and about sports, tv shows, whatever.\n\nIt's important that you don't get caught in just following your interest because when you have a conversation with someone, you need to find anchor points to make jokes or pick up more conversation paths. And knowing a lot of what's going on in the world and about the stuff people you meet follows, give you the eye and mind to spot those anchors in the slightest blinks of a conversation.\n\nI also found a work as salesman for some water distributing machines for companies.I purposefully chose a job that pushes an introvert out of his comfort zone and forces you to build a funny conversation with a perfect stranger based solely on what you see on his desk, on how it's dressed, on what he has on his shelves, or whatever comes, you never know.\n\nIt all turned into a carefully crafted game of giving a bit and taking a handful from people.\n\nLong story short:\n\nAs soon as I started university I had 100+ friends (which is super useful to share homeworks, notes etc) I was in the eye of the cyclone and invited to parties, people would get mad if I didn't participate and girls started to find me attractive for no reason beside my personality (proof is that most picky and snobby girls still ignored me for more handsome guys, but, hey, being snobby doesn't always mean beautiful) and even got into a threesome with 2 german girls that invited me to their home after being at the disco.\n\nSo, lead your friend into an action plan. Usually gamers and people like him like the thing posed as a challenge, But sometimes they don't react it well and still react like your friend did with the f\\*ckboy thing.\n\nYou have to try and try again.
