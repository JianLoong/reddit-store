We\u2019d also do board games and movie nights has well. I\u2019m okay paying for the local places, so it\u2019s not a money issue, it\u2019s Michelle\u2019s lack of trust in me. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching groups of kids for the past 8 years, so I know a good amount about kids and what\u2019s age appropriate and safe.

Honestly I would tell her to pound sand, but since you want to be more sensitive, maybe something like:\n\n\u201cI cannot risk my reputation in childcare by letting the kids go beyond 2 hours of screen time per day while in my care. Checking with you before each activity and being home bound for 4 days is not something I am willing to do, and I would not have taken the job if I had realized these were the terms.\n\nIf I babysit, it will involve multiple activities per day, outings in the car, and I will not be calling you to preauthorize each new activity with the kids.

Oh the audacity (sarcasm of course)", "The problem is when people come to count on the people around them to help sometimes they start to have expectations that don't match reality. You don't owe her. You're doing her a huge favor and she's taking it for granted. Don't let her take advantage of you but also don't let your bad experiences with her grind away that helpful spirit.
