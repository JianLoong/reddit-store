She kept information from you. \n\nI have two questions though. Why are the parents leaving the house? Why does she want a chaperone? \n\nMaybe she\u2019s scared her friends will do something dumb without adult supervision.

It doues not mean they were planing anything bad.", "NTA.  Sounds like a formula for disaster", "NTA. It sounds like she\u2019s using you so she can have the party she really wants. She\u2019s 16 and you just thwarted her plans. She probably told her friends her cool aunt will be the one chaperoning so they can do whatever they want.

It\u2019s just that the optics are f-ing weird.", "Nothing good can come of this for you.

Holy shit, have you considered what else she might lie about if something goes wrong?

That also shows that she thinks she'd be able to pressure you at the party to let her friends drink or allow other shenanigans.
