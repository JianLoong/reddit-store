For a while during and post-divorce my dad was trying really hard to win my mom back. I remember he would use my sister's and my upset about the divorce. For me it was hard to go from our family being together to two separate homes and families. For my sister, the upheaval was hard for her. She really couldn't get used to bouncing from home to home. Throughout all of that mom did her best to shield us and even though she must have hated my dad's guts for all the stunts he pulled, she kept some photos of him and our family from before up in the house. My sister and I felt reassured seeing them. Even though she didn't remember those times I think it made her feel a little more okay with how confusing it was, and dad only made it worse.\n\nDad gave up on them getting back together eventually and he insisted that everything we had at his house be from him and not mom and we could not have photos of mom in the home. I was 8 when he met my stepmom. I'm not sure how soon she found out that mom still had photos up of before but it became a huge deal for her and she told my mom she was not allowed photos of \"her man\" in mom's house.\n\nMy mom remarried when I was 10. We have a few photos of my stepdad's ex-wife at home and some from when he was married to her and my stepsiblings were young. This is especially important to them because their mom is terminally ill with a condition that made her unable to take care of them (I think it's something to do with her brain). There are still photos of dad at mom's too. I'm less into it now that I feel worse about what dad did. But my sister still feels comforted by them and mom always says he is still our dad/our family and she wants it to be as much our home as it is everyone else's who lives there.\n\nThe wall where these photos are is where mom takes a lot of our back to school photos. My stepmom found out they were still up and went nuts on my mom a few months ago. She told mom she had to do what she says, etc. It was insane. My mom told her to mind her business and if she stays out of her home she doesn't have to see or worry about them.\n\nMy stepmom went on a rant about mom a few days ago and she was like how dare your mom not do what I tell her and take the photos of my husband down. I told my stepmom she's pathetic for being so bothered that mom was a good enough mom to accept photos of dad for our sake and that she doesn't get to boss my mom around. I also told her to leave my mom alone because none of this had anything to do with her. She told me I did not get to speak to her that way. I told her if she thinks she's earning my respect with her shit then she's even more pathetic than I thought. It's been a rough few days. My dad and stepmom both say I was beyond disrespectful.

Bad mouthing a parent is a no-no in stepparenting, if she didn't understand that, she is out of touch. \n\nAddressing a child about adult conversations and situations is an invitation to a response from said child. Just because they didn't like the response is their fault. Never engage anyone, let alone a child, with a discussion that you don't know how they will respond.

Skimmed through the comments - I like the idea of saying the photos belong to you and your sister.  Also think you should look into whether you are required to be at your father's home or not.\n\nA few pieces of advice:\n\n1)  Try to find ways to push back without judgments on her.  That way you are not adding other escalation issues.  Not because doing so is AH behavior, but because you don't want to add fuel to a fire when you are at a disadvantage (being in her house without options).  One thing to call her pathetic (though true) and another to say you don't see why your mom has to do what she says with her own house.  See if you can learn how to confront her by asking questions - let her dig her own hole.\n\n2)  ***If you can and do decide that you don't have to be at his house, please make sure that you don't let your sister go over by herself.***  It does not sound like she would emotionally be able to handle your step mother.\n\n3)  Ask your mom to assist you in finding an attorney to represent you.  This shouldn't cost much since you don't have a pending case - all you really need is a name, contact info, and an introductory meeting to establish the \"on retainer\" relationship.  This situation could escalate quickly, especially considering your step mother is exhibiting some narcissistic behaviors.  If it does, you will want someone you can call immediately rather than delay while you find someone.  Do not mention it to you dad or step mother.

She put her own needs aside for the sake of children, in a way that made a difficult situation easier for children.  There's never shame in this, and it is, in fact, admirable.\n\nYour step-mother is being insecure and territorial.  My guess is that she knows, damned well, about your father trying to reconcile with your Mom.  Even if she hasn't been told the story, she will instinctively hear it in your Dad's voice, if he talks of her, and I'm sure he does because of his kids. She knows. She hates it. And she's doing what she can to stake her turf and defend it, no matter how ridiculous it is.  It's childish.\n\nNTA ...

Your dad is right that what you said isn\u2019t respectful, but he\u2019s confused about how respect works generally.

Your dad sounds like an asshole, but if he\u2019s got a college fund for you or something, it might be nice to apologize and demand that your stepmom and dad not discuss your mother around you.\n\nIf he has nothing to offer and is this much of an asshole, maybe it\u2019s best to call a spade a spade and allow yourself to become alienated.

Your stepmom has some insecurities she needs to get over, your dad has a backbone he needs to put a little TLC into. Your mom I think has the right frame of mind because her home should be your home And your step siblings home and your stepdad\u2019s home and her home.Period.  This is anecdotal, and I do not have references to give you, however in college one of my psych professors shared that studies were showing (20 yrs ago) the ability for a mother, versus the ability of the father, after a separation, or if they\u2019re the surviving parent, to be more resolutely objective at situationally prioritizing the needs of their kids, stepkids and new spouses according to their needs at the time.  Whereas the fathers/widowers were more likely to adopt the priorities and perspectives of their new spouse, even taking on their new spouses circle of friends, over and above their own kids.  I\u2019ve seen this happen in that my stepmom is much more objective, and has shown my brother and I the support and attention we may have needed during life events, even having to chastise my father when he would fail to do what was right and instead opt for a \u201clet me check with my wife first\u201d response \u2014 understandably upsetting my step mom because it reflected poorly on her.  At the end of the day, all four adults in this situation are the adults, they need to act like the adults and the parents. Otherwise they run the risk of those pictures being the only thing your sister is comforted by the caveat being, and I was the mouthy 15-year-old, it can be a hard thing to learn at your age, but it will pay dividends in the end, learning how to diplomatically hold the mirror up, instead of throwing it at someone\u2019s head.", "NTA you dad bought himself a remote control with this one-she runs everything everyone else does.", "Nta.

Stepdad understands why to have photos pre-divorce for the kids, but Stepmom doesn't.

Your stepmother isn't in charge of your mom or your mom's home. She must be extremely insecure to behave in such a manner. I don't believe you were wrong or owe them an apology. Your dad should man up and not allow that kind of hate towards your mother. He should love you more than he hates your mom. She is still your mom and he needs to man up and be a good father and think about what's best for his kids. Good for you for being mature enough to see the situation as an adult.

Then you can decide how much you want to visit your dad. Your sister may not be old enough yet but she\u2019s close. The age where I live is 14. Talk to your mother if this is something you want to consider and get all the facts down before moving forward with it. It\u2019s a large possibility you\u2019ll have to go to family court to change the custody paperwork, but it could be worth it in the end for your emotional and mental health. If you want to wait until your sister is old enough so it can be done at the same time, is also a good idea that way she has you to back her up. Sometimes it takes this sort of thing to make a person see the consequences of their actions. And if he cares at all about losing you two this will hurt him and maybe change some things. But since it\u2019s been like this the whole time, I\u2019d say nothing will. Good luck and stay strong for mom, sister and yourself. Never let them beat you down and bully you.

I jest of course, this would cause unnecessary strain on the situation.\n\nSeems to me you are at an age and your sister is close to the age where you get to decide if/when you go for visits. Sounds like your dad probably wouldn't care too much", "Then why do you care about what he or his wife say ?", "My guess is that OP's dad still pines for his mom. Step mom is well aware of it. And she is taking it out on OP's mom instead of dealing with the disappointment (No offence to OP) she married. Her reasoning being OP's mom must still want him too, why would she have his pictures at home?\n(Edited because comprehension is a skill lost on some people)", "There is one man at his father's house and it isn't his Dad. NTA\n\nHe is lucky to have such a great Mom who is raising a wonderful man.", "If they want to live with mom full time maybe just tell dad and mom straight up. I also have issues with my step-mom and something therapists suggested was forcing a relationship outside of their house such as meeting on the weekends for a movie, dinner whatever. Limited contact might actually improve the relationship.\n\nOp could tell dad they aren't at the house where step mom keeps bashing their mom and could tell mom the same thing though leave out how step mom is smacktalking her.", "Maybe that's what step-mom wants.  No kids; just \"her man\".", "I so would do that, but I am 19m with 24 years experience...and a petty streak that gets tickled in such a special way by stuff like this.  OP is NTA", "Op literally explained why the mom had pictures in her house. Reading is a skill...", "And that would be perfectly fine if OP and his sister could go live with their mom and step dad permanently.  Their father doesn't seem like the best to be around and step mother certainly isn't.  I can't believe her nerve, smh.", "So is comprehension. I was explaining step-mom's reasoning behind attacking OP's mom."]}
