{"id": 32117, "submission_id": "188hqc2", "title": "AITA for telling my stepmom she's pathetic and doesn't get to boss my mom around?", "selftext": "My parents divorced when I (15m) was 5 and my sister was 3. For a while during and post-divorce my dad was trying really hard to win my mom back. I remember he would use my sister's and my upset about the divorce. For me it was hard to go from our family being together to two separate homes and families. For my sister, the upheaval was hard for her. She really couldn't get used to bouncing from home to home. Throughout all of that mom did her best to shield us and even though she must have hated my dad's guts for all the stunts he pulled, she kept some photos of him and our family from before up in the house. My sister and I felt reassured seeing them. Even though she didn't remember those times I think it made her feel a little more okay with how confusing it was, and dad only made it worse.\n\nDad gave up on them getting back together eventually and he insisted that everything we had at his house be from him and not mom and we could not have photos of mom in the home. I was 8 when he met my stepmom. I'm not sure how soon she found out that mom still had photos up of before but it became a huge deal for her and she told my mom she was not allowed photos of \"her man\" in mom's house.\n\nMy mom remarried when I was 10. We have a few photos of my stepdad's ex-wife at home and some from when he was married to her and my stepsiblings were young. This is especially important to them because their mom is terminally ill with a condition that made her unable to take care of them (I think it's something to do with her brain). There are still photos of dad at mom's too. I'm less into it now that I feel worse about what dad did. But my sister still feels comforted by them and mom always says he is still our dad/our family and she wants it to be as much our home as it is everyone else's who lives there.\n\nThe wall where these photos are is where mom takes a lot of our back to school photos. My stepmom found out they were still up and went nuts on my mom a few months ago. She told mom she had to do what she says, etc. It was insane. My mom told her to mind her business and if she stays out of her home she doesn't have to see or worry about them.\n\nMy stepmom went on a rant about mom a few days ago and she was like how dare your mom not do what I tell her and take the photos of my husband down. I told my stepmom she's pathetic for being so bothered that mom was a good enough mom to accept photos of dad for our sake and that she doesn't get to boss my mom around. I also told her to leave my mom alone because none of this had anything to do with her. She told me I did not get to speak to her that way. I told her if she thinks she's earning my respect with her shit then she's even more pathetic than I thought. It's been a rough few days. My dad and stepmom both say I was beyond disrespectful.

You were disrespectful. But your stepmom richly deserved it with her immature and entitled behavior. Respect--even between parental type adults and their children is something that has to be earned.

Your mom understands that. Your stepmom just sounds psycho...maybe because she knows that the only reason your mom and dad aren't together is because your mom doesn't want it.

Definitely, if you used the language with her that you used in your post.\n\nSome people would say respect has to be earned, but I won't go that far. I *will* say that there are valid reasons that respect can be lost, and you've got valid reasons.\n\nDoes your stepmom have any control over your life, other than being able to give you a hard time when you're at your dad's?

Might consider having a one on one conversation with your dad about this and let him know if he hopes to maintain a relationship with you after you turn 18, he needs to get step mom off your back.", "NTA. Make sure you set your boundaries with her and, if needed, stay away. My grandma on my dad's side always wanted to set us up against our mom after the divorce, she once locked all the doors after one of our fights because she was convinced I was gonna 'escape' to my mom's (I was around 14...). All those attempts at manipulation really ate at me more than I admitted, never be afraid to talk about it with a trusted teacher or counsellor at school.

After all, she married a man who obviously had sex before, and OP and sister ate proof of that.  Is she worried Mom is going to take his cheating rear end back?
