But I really do think you may want to attend the party. I mean your grandmother is going to be 80 years old and not have many more birthday parties. I hope I'm not making you even sadder than you already are but I suspect that the victims would understand.", "NTA. I don't necessarily agree with your reasoning, but people mourn tragedies in different ways. If you need to stay home because you're still grappling with this, your family should understand. Maybe you could pay a separate visit to your grandmother to make sure she feels like you're still valuing her.", "You need to talk to the impacted parties and hear what they want.\n\nIf you make assumptions on what they want then yeah to being the a h.

For some people, a tragedy could be losing a dog although that wouldn't be a good reason to miss a loved one's birthday party 3 weeks later.", "NAH\n\nGrandma is still 80. Regardless of what tragedy has struck your family, she wants to mark her birthday in a low-key way. You don't want to party at the moment. That's OK - send your grandma your love and tell her you're sorry you'll miss her party.", "INFO: You say \"I have no idea if the people affected approve of the party still happening (and no way to tactfully find out)\"... Why can't you ask them how they feel, or just generally ask them what is the best way for you to support them? Or at the very least, ask if they're going to the party (if they are still invited)? \n\nIf you skip the party but the people who experienced the tragedy still go, you'd be doubly an AH for both missing your grandmother's party AND not being there to support the victims of the tragedy who might need your support there. Maybe that isn't a possible outcome but without knowing any more details, we can only speculate at possibilities.", "That's exactly why I'm so torn. She will probably be hurt.  Other family members will likely be hurt if they found out we all went to a party. \n\nI hate this.", "Thank you.", "Trust me, I'm not even sure of my reasoning, which is why I'm struggling so hard with this. I want to do the best thing I can, by everyone. Thank you for your help, it is so appreciated.", "I really appreciate the honesty.  I'm desperate for another point of view, so I'll risk categorizing it broadly.  Life altering to more than one family member. Not distant family members, not like, 2nd cousins or inlaws we never see or something.", "Thank you.", "I'm so sorry for your sadness.", "Ok.  So, it sounds quite traumatic and something that would take a good amount of time to cope with.  Under such circumstances, you would NTA if you skipped this party.  My condolences to you and hope you are able to find peace."]}
