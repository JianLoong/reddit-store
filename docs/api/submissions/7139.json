There is so much wrong here. Let\u2019s start with your dad dating a 23 year old, moving her into the house he shares WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN, and knocking her up, like all that\u2019s normal and you should just accept it.", "So your Dad is dating and impregnating girls younger than his offspring? While I'm all for letting people do their thing, and as long as they aren't hurting anyone or doing something illegal, but this would stil be very very very weird to me. If the baby wasn't coming from my \"mom\" and \"dad\" I probably wouldn't see it as a sibling either.", "Info why would you be surprised she won\u2019t drive you around anymore?", "Wow this situation is so bizarre. Your parents, who are together but dating others, want you to bond with a woman only a few years older than you *who your dad is dating* and has impregnated? And call her \"mum\"? \n\nThere's a lot to take in and consider lol. I'd say ESH. Your parents suck for acting like this is some totally normal situation that you just need to be okay with... But if you're asking specifically if you'd be an asshole for not recognizing this new baby as a sibling... I'd say yes. The situation is really fucking bizarre, but this baby hasn't done anything wrong and it wouldn't be right to resent this new person coming into the world because of personal reasons. And I don't think you can really hold it against Kayla for not helping you out anymore when you insulted her and she heard you.\n\nBut again, this situation is so bizarre and has so many layers. These are just my personal thoughts.", "NTA and this is such a creepy story, why is your dad knocking up girls his daughter's age? your mom is crazy for allowing that in her house", "INFO: why is Kayla giving you an allowance and tidying your room?", "This situation is absolutely crazy, the idea you would call Kayla mum is bonkers. Your parents are massive assholes , if they want to live this lifestyle they should have waited until you and your youngest sibling were 18 so that you weren't forced to live alongside this lunacy.\n\nI don't blame you at all for not wanting anything to do with Kayla or her child. I think your mum and dad are completely in the wrong. I worry for Kayla too, in 10 years time when she's going to be raising a kid and in a relationship with two pensioners, sounds like a nightmare.

As many other people have said, this situation is insane and unhealthy and I share concerns for Kayla. This is creepy. HOWEVER this does not take away from the fact that you're a huge AH for saying stuff like this and then getting upset that Kayla isn't doing nice things for you. Why should she give you an allowance? Why should she drive you around?\n\n I'm saying YTA because in the conflict you're asking about, between you and Kayla, you're the AH.", "NTA. This entire thing is so idk\u2026kinda weird\u2026 dad had to be in his mid to late 40s or older, impregnating a 23 year old. personally, i wouldn\u2019t see the child as a sibling either, that doesn\u2019t mean you resent it, it just means you simply won\u2019t acknowledge the child to be part of your life as a brother/sister, which to me, is reasonable.", "NTA. \n\nThe whole situation is bloody sick, and it\u2019s not exactly you\u2019re resenting an unborn, but a family dynamics that would distress anyone.", "NTA whatever about the seeing other people in their own private time and away from the house moving the other woman into the house and expecting you to call her mom is kind of weird.As for the baby it's technically your half sibling but that doesn't mean you have to be excited.", "NTA. You are a teenager and it's entirely legitimate for you to be frankly _weirded out_ by your dad's girlfriend, who is younger than some of your siblings, moving in and being pushed on you as a mother figure by your parents. Even if she's nice, it's entirely legitimate to want _nothing_ to do with this entire situation. \n\nYour parents and Kayla are adults and legally free to do what they like - but it doesn't mean they are free to do whatever they like with no consequences. They can't force you to think of or call Kayla's baby your sibling. They can't force you to think of or call Kayla your mum. They can't force you to have anything to do with anyone once you move out and are independent.\n\nBut - if you want Kayla to drive you around /give you money you might want to keep quiet about your feelings for now. She doesn't _have_ to do those things either.", "NTA, as long as you don't take out your frustration/anger/etc on the kid; it's not the kid's fault.\n\nMany families, and biological siblings, don't act as a \"loving\" sibling/family unit.  It is OK to not be close to someone in the family, even blood relatives.  \n\nIt is a good sign Kayla does not try to force a relationship with you (despite your parents trying to force it).  It shows some maturity on her part; and it's normal for Kayla to be hurt if she feels rejected by you.  It may take a while for you, Kayla, and the rest of your family to find equilibrium in this dynamic relationship, and to be comfortable with some bonds being stronger than others.", "NTA\n\nIf your parents wanted to become polygamous they should have waited until you had all grown up and flown the nest.

She's a stranger to you that happened to be in a relationship with your dad. If you stay cordial that is completely fine. If you dislike her that is fine, too.\n\n>she wishes I\u2019d call Kayla mum\n\nThat's insanely weird. You have a mum. Why would your own mother want you to call a 23 year old woman you barely know mum?\n\n>as soon as I move out I won\u2019t have a thing to do with Kayla or the baby\n\nThat is completely fine too. You barely know the woman and if you move out soon you will even have less to do with her. Don't see a reason why you should feel any different than you do.\n\n>I can\u2019t resent an unborn child\n\nYou don't. You simply don't want a relationship with the baby. And that is completely up to you.\n\n>Kayla won\u2019t drive me to see my friends anymore\n\nI think you'll have to accept that your step-mother/daughter relationship is over if you say that you don't want to have anything to do with Kayla or her child after you moved out. This is a two way street, so if you want her help/money you'll have to hang out with them. If you don't care to have that she won't make an effort for you, understandably.

I get not wanting anything to do with her but considering she is even cleaning your own goddamn room you can at least be civil.", "Oh wow, this situation is so gross. Your father has moved his mistress into the same house as his children, half of whom are older than his mistress, and he is putting that mistress to work as a domestic servant for those children (it's \"her job\" to tidy up the house, including your room? She's giving children who are almost her peers allowance?). And your mother's decision to go along with this is also creepy. What all are Kayla's domestic duties?\n\nYou are NTA at all, but also be aware that Kayla is likely being exploited in this situation as well. This new baby will technically be your half sibling, it will be blameless in all of this, but that doesn't obligate you to develop a bond with it. Nor are you obligated to develop a bond with your father's mistress who is almost your age.\n\nWhat you are obligated to do is to stop contributing to Kayla's exploitation. Stop letting her clean your room and drive you about, stop accepting an allowance from her. She's not your parent, she can't be your parent.", "NTA but you need to stop taking the allowance that she gives you and stop expecting her to drive you around. Just like how you shouldn\u2019t be expected to care about this unborn child, she shouldn\u2019t be expected to do all these things for you", "NTA and your father is gross as hell sleeping with someone YOUNGER than 2 of his kids and your mom well she\u2019s gross too. \n\nKayla doesnt have to do anything for you and you dont need to see her as family either but since she now knows how you really feel about her she is rightfully stepping back from any interactions with you as she should. Find your own ride and get a job so you dont need an allowance. You cant have it both ways either you accept her and make the best of this wild ass situation or reject it all 100% just dont interact with her at all and dont expect anything from her.", "NTA\n\nI will never understand how some people can just accept as normal a man (or woman) dating someone who is *younger* than their own children. It\u2019s weird. And kinda fucked up. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to view Kayla as a mom, and the fact that your mom would even want that shows how fucked up your family truly is. She\u2019s 6 years older than you. She\u2019s not your mom and she\u2019s not even your step mom! Your dad has somehow managed to have some kind of weird sister wives bullshit happening here and no one else in your family seems to question it. \n\nThis baby is technically your half sibling but if you don\u2019t feel connected to them or maybe just don\u2019t want to feel connected to them that is totally fine! \n\nYou\u2019re 17 and your family life is all kinds of complicated, you\u2019re allowed to not want to add more complications into this. You\u2019re allowed to feel the way you do. \n\nKayla is not family to you. That\u2019s fine. What\u2019s not fine is your parents trying to force you to feel a connection with her that\u2019s just not there. \n\nFamily can be complicated on their own, add in half siblings and things are bound to get even more complicated. That\u2019s not even taking into account the sister wife in your house. You wouldn\u2019t be the only person to not bond with a half sibling that\u2019s 17 years younger than you. It\u2019s fine.", "NTA.  What the fuck, I'm all for ppl doing what they want, but your dad brought home a 23yo as a sexual partner and the family is just like great we have a hot new young mom. WTAF.", "YTA but you're a young one, so it's understandable in a way.  Your parents are people too, and apparently they are polyamorous people.  I can see why you feel weirded out by it, but their relationship with Kayla is different and separate from your relationship with them or your relationship with Kayla.  \n\nThe baby WILL be your sibling, and while it's your choice about how to approach it, you need to understand that will not change.  If your dad is the baby's father, then that baby is related to you.  \n\nAnd you are definitely TA because you were more than happy for Kayla to take on parenting responsibilities without giving anything in return.  You expect her to clean your room, give you money, and take you places while you give her the bare minimum amount of consideration in return.  She did those things because she cared for you, and you've shown her that her care was misplaced.  She is reacting accordingly and giving you what you asked for: No relationship with her or her baby.", "There are an awful lot of judgements being made based upon the parents' non-monogamous relationship and/or the age of their partner, which seems unjust.\n\nKayla here is effectively a step-parent (albeit an unconventional one), and from all the OP has said (and what can be inferred from what is not said) - one that has been nothing but respectful and generous.\n\nShe is going to have, what I assume to be, OP's half-sibling.\n\nOP's feelings on the matter may or may not be understandable. OP's behaviour towards Kayla in communicating them, not so much.\n\nYou told someone (that has apparently been nothing but kind to you) that you don't and won't give a toss about their child, and somehow you turn this into the idea that *you're* the victim because things are awkward and that they no longer want to do you favours?\n\nYTA", "Let\u2019s see\u2026 woman gets pregnant by your father\u2026 yep it\u2019s your sibling and there is nothing you can do about it but accept the fact.

You can't be forced to have any feeling for Kayla or her baby", "YTA\n\nTo be fair, your family dynamic is incredibly effed up, and anyone who thinks you should be fine with the weirdness is out of their minds.\n\nThat being said, Kayla goes out of her way to be kind to you. She does a lot for you that, by your own admission, you didn\u2019t even have to ask for. She does it from kindness.\n\nLike it or not, this new baby is your half-sibling, and you are a fool to rob yourself of a potentially amazing relationship just bc you\u2019re bitter about your parents\u2019 marriage.

Be mad at your weirdo parents. Kayla sounds better than both of them.", "YTA that is 100% your sibling just from your father's side. Nothing else to it", "NTA. It's a really awkward situation they're all putting you in.  Kayla included.", "YTA While you definitely don\u2019t have to feel emotionally close to anyone you don\u2019t want to, no one is acting like an asshole here but you. Sounds like Kayla goes above and beyond to treat you well WHILE respecting your emotional boundaries. If your mad at your parents for\u2026whatever reason(?) direct that attitude over that way not to the person whose done right by you every six ways from Sunday. The fact that you end this whining about how she won\u2019t take you to see your friends anymore is really the cherry on top of this bratty post.", "NTA. Your parents however...", "NTA you are entitled to your feelings", "The baby is not at fault for the adult\u2019s behavior, don\u2019t take that out on them. I have a sibling (21years younger than me) from my father\u2019s affair. Hate the mom, hate the situation that brought her into my life, love her. \n\nYTA for taking Kayla\u2019s money, making her your ride, and having her clean your room. She\u2019s not too our maid, chauffeur, or piggy bank. Even if you were bonding with her, these things would be wrong. You\u2019re almost an adult, act like it.", "You have a reason to be mad here. Kayla represents the destruction of your family unit. But, it wasn't her who destroyed it. It's your parents who did that. Both of them are complicit in that and neither seem to comprehend that they have. I worry for you, Kayla, your sibling, and this new baby. Get out as soon as you can. And take Kayla and her baby with you.", "NTA and I am so so sorry you're having to deal with this nonsense. It's creepy and bizarre and of course you're not interested.\n\nAs you get older your half sibling will too, it's not their fault they were asked to be born. You don't have to be friends or hang out with them, but if they ever reach out remember its not their fault they exist. \n\nYour parents are the evil here. Work hard in school and move out of rhe circus.", "As you said she's  not family to you, and you never asked her to do anything for you, now she's doing what you wanted so now you want her to drive you around? You can be angry about what's happening all you want but can expect to only get the benefits while bashing her unborn child...this smell Mormon from miles away though.", "NTA. Kayla needs to wise up; she can't buy your affection with an allowance or lifts. Your feelings are valid and she shouldn't have been listening in on your conversations.", "Pay no attention to the ytas going around. When you were 16 your dad met Kayla, which is fine, they are grown ups and all that. But you cant do anything about this situation so you are put into this impossible situation. You are just asked to accept everything that happens around you. F that, NTA for not accepting everything around you, you havent done anything except maybe talked a bit too loud and blunt so Kayla heard and got sad about it.", "Dad's certainly living his best life!\n\nNTA but just remember that the baby is still a half sibling, and crucially has no blame in any of this.", "YTA if you ask me yes the girls is very young , but it sounds to me she reallh tries her  best even goes out of her way to provide for you and i guess your other siblings since they are the ones complaining about lack of allowance, I think she wants to be closer to you but she just doesn't push you because she is young and it doesn 't feel right to her.And for the people calling her her dad's mistress not every situation like this is dire as it sounds they may really love eachother.", "NAH. Well, your dad seems like an AH to me, what with dating & impregnating a woman younger than some of his kids, but that wasn\u2019t the question. You have a right to see who you want to & to have or not have a relationship with members of your family. However, the baby will be your legal half sibling no matter how you choose to think about it.

If it makes you more comfortable to place the half when refering to them it might help you with keeping the peace.\n\nBetween you and Kayla I'm going NAH (though I really feel your parents are AH for throwing you into this and not properly handling adding a third to their relationship), but I'm assuming that she may have been taken a little advantage of when your parents were seeking to add people to their relationship (especially if there is a hierarchy beyond how you kids respond to parental guidelines).

You get to choose how you feel, and it is a complicated situation seeing as biologically, this child will be your half sibling anyway.

Personally, I find your parents\u2019 situation uncomfortable, but accept that adults can choose to do whatever they want to within their consenting relationship. If they want to accept others into their relationship (uncertain if it\u2019s polyamory or polygamy) they of course can do that. That said, in an environment where under 18s are still \u2018forced\u2019 to live at home, I do think that the parents are being AHs for putting this on their children, especially the hope that you will see the additional partners as parents.

It doesn\u2019t make you an AH, but it\u2019s on the cusp. You benefit from her, but have no intentions of ever even treating her as a friend once you move out?

In short, it takes AT LEAST 2x the effort of a \u2018normal\u2019 relationship because it\u2019s basically like having two relationships. The unicorn term comes into play when 2/3 just want the novelty of a fuck buddy/house maid/ sugar mommy or daddy instead of seeing them as a person and equal in the relationship. My personal experience was bad, I was the sugar mom paying and doing everything when they did nothing in every sense of the word. In this situation I see it as a lot of red flags and a unicorn situation not only because of the age difference but because they\u2019re forcing their children to see her as another mom when they\u2019re all old enough and closer in age with this young woman to be more of a sibling than anything else. It\u2019s seen as unethical because this is a young woman with presumably partners old enough to easily be her parents, she was moved in rather quickly by the sounds of it, from the sounds of it does more of the parenting and house work that the actual parents, AND is now pregnant with a new child to add into the mix. It\u2019s unethical because of the dynamic between the three \u2018consenting\u2019 adults to suddenly force a motherly role on someone their children\u2019s age, and it\u2019ll cause a lot of confusion for when said baby is born. We also don\u2019t know the entire dynamic (neither does OP), so there\u2019s a higher chance of everything going wrong. We don\u2019t know if the 23yo has a job, is in school, is being groomed, is being manipulated to be a SAHM, or a slew of other things. A common practice in poly/BDSM circles is a consent form (basically a sort of contract where every party involved puts what they\u2019re ok with, what their grey areas are, what are hard no\u2019s, safe words, etc) because then there\u2019s a document that can be edited and there are boundaries and things set in place for all foreseeable problem. This does sound more like a unicorn/novelty for the parents that\u2019s getting out of hand because now there\u2019s a baby involved, and a parental role being forced on a young woman who probably doesn\u2019t have a lot of dating background to go off of. Obviously OP won\u2019t know (and shouldn\u2019t know) all the ins and outs of her parents dynamic, but because of that there are too many bad variables of how this can go really wrong for it to be ok. Hope this helps", "In an ideal situation, it's not unethical.

But often the third person is going to have one person they prefer out of the two, that's just how human nature is.

You have to be really careful with the power dynamic there.", ">I think the unethical aspect comes in when the third partner is treated like an afterthought?\n\nThat's true of any partner, though. Being taken for granted is no bueno.\n\nAs long as everyone's on the same page, and everyone feels equally respected and well-treated, it's fine imo. Have been in that situation, everyone was happy and had equal investment, parted amicably and are still friends. We talk about that time fondly.", "Nope. But then I\u2019m not the one who decided to date that guy (and possibly his wife)", "I mean, she just said \"loading the dishwasher\". I'm gonna go ahead and guess one of the ladies empties it, so he only has half a freaking job, while the PREGNANT LADY cleans the whole damn house.", "Maybe it\u2019s just me and maybe it\u2019s because sex trafficking has become a real legitimate problem in many parts of the world and seems to be a news topic constantly these days, but if didn\u2019t know better it sure sounds like maybe Kayla\u2019s been a victim of sex trafficking. \n\nA real young girl comes into this household dynamic to date a much older man, sounds like she\u2019s basically a maid and a chauffeur. And she gives her money to the daughter? Now she\u2019s pregnant? \nWhat the fuck is going on here?", "Yeah in my early 20s I had all manner of older couples wanting me to be their 3rd because at the time I though I was pansexual (have since learned that it is asexuality). Every one of those proposed relationships were meant for me to be the bang maid of the couple. There was no \"the three of us\" it was either me and the husband would have solo time or the 3 of us would be together in bed but I didn't get equal say in the relationship, I wouldn't get to chose the dates the husband took me on and the wife would never give me the time of day unless it was to make the husband happy or because she wanted something from me. One of the couples that asked me to be their third was my good friends parents. I met them when I was 15. They used to let me drink Mike's Hard and margaritas at their house with their kid because \"they'd rather we do it at their house under supervision than at a party\". Which tbf is also the attitude I'd have for my kid with weed if she were a 16 yr old. But I babysat my friends younger siblings. It was weird AF to get propositions by them at their daughter's party when I was 20.  I didn't even know they saw me like that. \n\nAnd it was ALWAYs men 15-20years older than me with a wife who was 5-10years older than me. I had one guy try really hard to be their third and he was in his 60s and his wife was 36 and I was 22. I was grossed out by that dude so much. He constantly offered me to have sex with his wife so I would get experience with women and all he wanted was \"to watch\". Most unicorn hunters seem to only care about how the [usually much younger] woman can do to sexually gratify the main couple.", "Yes, but I think it can be easier to be taken for granted as part of a throuple when the previous two members already have a well formed relationship. \n\nI\u2019m not poly but I have poly friends, and many of them avoid throuples/ closed triads for that reason", "Yeah I really want to ask insensitive and possibly icky questions like \n\nIs she from your country? She works; but does she come from a poor background? Where and how did dad meet her? Does she have access to her own documents like passport etc"]}
