He\u2019s had varying excuses, like it\u2019s going to be too hot, there\u2019s a big game that he wants to watch, or there\u2019s too much stuff to do around the house, so I\u2019ve let it go. \n\nSo tomorrow is going to be the first day in the area we live in where the weather is actually cooling off.  I\u2019ve been really excited all week thinking about what we should do with the first day it\u2019s actually going to feel like fall weather and I mentioned to my husband this morning that I want to take our son to the zoo tomorrow morning since it will be so nice out. He agreed at first, because he loves cooler weather as well, but then he remembered that there\u2019s a big college football game on tomorrow smack in the middle of when the zoo will be open. He wants to wait for the game to be over before going to the zoo, but at that point we\u2019ll only have an hour or two left for the zoo to be open and we\u2019ll miss the coolest time of the day. He\u2019s also planning on going to a football viewing party all day on Sunday, so it\u2019s not just like we can go then. I am working overtime the next few weekends, and I don\u2019t know when the weather is going to be good again. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I just went without him and leave him to watch his football game?

He is prioritizing watching LIVE football games (as he refuses to record them and watch them later) over spending time and having experiences with his own child!!! This is to the point of not healthy. You said he was eager to go until he realized there was a game that day. He needs to get his priorities straight.", "Your husband is a selfish asshole. Go to the zoo and enjoy your day.", "NTA.", "You will not be TA, and you will be doing him a favour by leaving him at home. \nPlease put the parental code on TV before you go out. Play dumb when he calls for passcode.", "I told my husband that I was just going to do whatever I wanted with or without him if he didn\u2019t make an effort.

Yes he's out of line, but don't miss out on an amazing experience for you & the lil one just because he's too damn selfish. Go & have a cool time without rushing it and don't regret it!!", "I feel like this is a warning sign that he\u2019s not going to be an active father, like the dad that\u2019s not really there in the kids life and the mom does everything for the kid but this is just the first time it\u2019s happened.", "NTA there are only so many years you can go take your child on family outings. Soon enough he'll be a grumpy teenager who'd rather go with his friends.

You should have words - they\u2019re only young once and he\u2019s going to miss it all for a stupid game", "Go to the zoo and have a good time, unfortunately he probably won\u2019t even care, he sounds thoroughly selfish\n\nNTA", "NTA, why are you even considering putting your life on hold to accommodate his hobbies?", "NTA. I Love Football, like really really love football. just typing this makes me wish it was Saturday already. but I never missed any of my son's \"firsts\". I was always there and if it was a really important/fun game to watch i would pay for a streaming service and just have the game on my phone while we walked at the zoo", "NTA however more than 2 hours at the zoo may be a bit tiring.", "I\u2019ve asked him to record the games before, and he looked at me like I\u2019d slapped him. Apparently it\u2019s not the same thing, so if he\u2019s not sitting there watching it live, he\u2019s just not going to see it at.", "I had to do this with my ex husband.

Wish HUSBAND could have come' and when people ask why he didn't go, just tell them his football game was more important.   \n\n\nAlso, I'd seriously be considering if this is someone you really want to spend the rest of your life and raise a child with. He's prioritizing glorified fetch that he isn't even participating in over you and your son.", "NTA - Do what this comment says and enjoy the zoo with your baby boy. Your husband needs to grow up and stop putting a game that has no legitimate bearing on his life before his family.", "And it always will be.

They will have fun in the moment. Who cares if they appreciate it later? Do you know how many things I've done that I have had a blast doing that I don't remember as the years go by? It doesn't mean I should just never go anywhere.", "I wouldn\u2019t do that, I didn\u2019t mean to sound like I would just leave with the baby and not say anything.", "I mentioned it in a different comment, but this is also about what time I would like to go to be able to enjoy my time with my baby on one of my rare days off.", "Not the case at all. Most 7 month olds love looking at animals", "discussion. The way OP writes it, the football takes over ALL free time, apparently no compromise from his side at all?", "I can't wait to pull that one out. Hey husband, you have to do all the parenting during weekends in the fall because fall is my time to pursue my interests. The *schedules just didn't align.* Maybe you can have interests when the kid moves out, and I can bond with them in the off season. That's normal for families, right?", "The fact that they don\u2019t remember it doesn\u2019t mean it is not beneficial. I don\u2019t remember learning to walk but it has been quite influential to me life - babies brains are making over 700 new neural connection every single second. And they love animals.", "Later in the day, around 2-4p, is hotter than the morning time. The zoo is only open 10a-5p, so waiting till the sun goes down and everything cools off isn\u2019t really an option.", "Ummm...1-4 is hottest where I live...in the US.", "They are all just football games \ud83d\ude44 I grew up in Knoxville home of the Vols. They are all just another football game. \n\nI don\u2019t live there anymore.

I would never lie to him about where we are, no matter what is going on. Didn\u2019t even imply I would. \n2. We literally have each other\u2019s locations at all times for safety reasons, so this is pointless.", "Where is she lying?", "Oh we already know he\u2019s gonna choose football over his kid so it\u2019s probably just let him know. I hope she goes and bonds with her child it will be a good day.", "I meant excited all week about the weather, I really didn\u2019t think of the zoo till this morning, and I didn\u2019t know that this specific game was going to be on at the same time.", "What difference would notice have made? Could he have rescheduled the football game with more notice?", ">yeah, I know I'm dating myself by calling it that.)\n\n\ud83d\udcfc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udec2", "Honestly I think that says all that needs to be said. If he isn't even willing to make a minor compromise like that then I think you really need to have a serious discussion with him about the responsibilies of being a parent and what that entials, unless you want to continue to be stuck in this situation where your partner prioritises watching a game ahead of spending time with his family. You could go to the zoo, take loads of pics and really emphasise to everyone how amazed your child was and how happy it made you to see her like that and maybe, just maybe, he might feel like he would have rathered seen that in person instead of watching a bunch of guys kick a ball - I wouldn't bet on it though from the sounds of it.", "Just tell him. I'm taking our boy to the zoo. I hope you decide to come with us and experience this wonderful First Excursion To The Zoo with me. But if you'd rather watch football, then we'll try to have a good time without you.", "NTA Totally agree with this. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this especially with a 7 month old. This is amazingly short sighted and self centered.\n\nSure, pre-kids I know plenty of people who wouldn\u2019t miss a game, would turn it on at an event, would even plan their wedding around Sunday football, but literally none of them choose it over their child. Once you have kids that\u2019s your priority, over (almost) everything let alone football. Plus he\u2019s watching college football, and the NFL so it\u2019s not even his fav team it\u2019s like all football from sept to feb?? \n\nI could maybe understand if he was making any attempt to be flexible, like go in the morning and then he can record and just catch up on the game when you get home. But literally if there is football on of any kind he\u2019s not willing to go?\n\nIs he going to the football party solo Sunday? So what exactly would happen if you have any hobbies or wanted solo time during football season. I honestly hope you\u2019re going too otherwise there idea that he\u2019s leaving you all day Sunday with the baby and is still unwilling to do family time Saturday is pretty unfair and beyond inconsiderate. \n\nYou definitely have to sit down and talk about expectations and responsibilities as a parent. What are his priorities. This needs to get figured out before you guys consider more kids and the responsibilities only grow\n\nEdited to say: take you baby To the zoo! But your husband can\u2019t watch the game on his phone if he comes bc I can see that happening too.", "NTA\n\nMy sister is also a \"football widow.\"  It blows my mind how my BIL acts about (and during) football season.  He can't even eat dinner with our family without the TV being on, and he has to be positioned so he can see the TV ***at all times.***", "NTA.  What's more important a football game or your and his child?  His priorities are out of whack here.  He can't miss one Saturday for you and his child?", "NTA \n\nWhy can\u2019t you take your son to the zoo and he joins you there after the game? \n\nYou seem afraid to ask - maybe not a good sign if you\u2019re concerned about his answer if you ask to go without him. \n\nAll of that said, if you decide to wait for the game to end and you only have 1-2 hours, that\u2019s still more than enough time for a 7 month old.", "But why can't y'all go on a Sunday as a compromise? Your son is 7 months old it's not like he has any concept of time, so if you told him Saturday and changed your mind the kid won't know.", "Glorified fetch!!! OMG I love this! :)", "I\u2019m going to be 50 and my parents are STILL like this. I\u2019ve always hated football season because of it.", "I agree, for the most part. Where the prioritizing comes in, is not taking him to the zoo in favor of football. So he shouldn't have any room for complaint there.", "One of the best things about having a baby is being able to show them so many cool things - everything is new to them!! And they take EVERYTHING in! If we waited until they \u201cremembered\u201d things then we would never teach them how to read, or what a butterfly looks like, or songs, or anything in this world bc they\u2019re a baby and that\u2019s how they learn. Most importantly, YOU have an amazing memory of such a special day together. It\u2019s sad that your husband will miss out but you can\u2019t put your life and your baby\u2019s development on hold for football season. NTA in any way, and I hope you have fun", "Even if he won't remember it later, he is old enough to have fun looking at the animals with you. We have some cute pictures of my son visitng the zoo as a baby; he doesn't remember the specific day but he can look back at it now and enjoy knowing that he has in fact seen a panda in person.", "A baby's eyesight is horrible, they don't develop full vision until after a year old. The most they'll enjoy is their mother's enjoyment and her talking to them. The mother will enjoy this trip a lot more is what I'm getting at. All I'm pointing out is that it's not that big of a deal for a first trip to the zoo. Next time the baby can be older, and they'll consider THAT to be their first time to the zoo. My mother used to tell me I went to Disneyland as an infant. I don't remember anything- I went as an adult and I still consider that my first time... Because I actually remember what was going on.", "Same where I live, 2-4 is peak heat.", "Real talk, you\u2019re NTA if you go to the zoo with your baby. (Though I can say at that age, the trip is for you.  Your baby won\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d - I say that as someone who loves the zoo and couldn\u2019t wait to take my kids.)\n\nBut I also think it\u2019s okay to plan things around watching a special game/event, too. You\u2019ll never catch me at a Turkey Trot for many reasons, but primarily because watching the parade is a special thanksgiving tradition for me, you know?", "Is he betting money on the games?", "To be honest, I get this. I watch a few sports and don\u2019t enjoy it nearly as much if I don\u2019t watch live. There\u2019s a temptation to skip through the slow bits and rush through it, even if I\u2019m enjoying it. Plus there\u2019s too much risk of spoilers! \n\nBut still, NTA. Although, I\u2019m assuming you suggested you\u2019d just take baby and he can watch the game? What was his response? Does he spend time with baby generally? Cos I sort of feel like this may be NAH. My boyfriend is a great dad; he works hard, covers child care while I\u2019m at work and does 7pm-4am night duty. He\u2019s very involved in his daughters life. But sometimes he wants a couple of hours to do his own thing. He loves gaming but between work and being a dad he doesn\u2019t have much time to do it anymore. So I\u2019ll take the baby out so he can have the house to himself for a while. If I want to take her somewhere new I\u2019ll run it by him incase he wants to join us but otherwise I\u2019ll just take her somewhere and he can have a lazy morning or an afternoon gaming session or whatever he wants. Usually I\u2019ll suggest somewhere and say \u2018if you don\u2019t want to come you can just chill at home\u2019 and he will say something like \u2018will you be cross if I don\u2019t come??\u2019 He knows I won\u2019t be, it\u2019s just his cute code for \u2018is this an important first experience i don\u2019t want to miss?\u2019 \ud83d\ude02 I think it\u2019s perfectly normal and healthy to have time to yourself, away from the kids, to do your own thing and if football is his thing then I don\u2019t see the problem (providing he\u2019s stepping up at other times). We\u2019re always telling mums they need to take time for themselves. In a properly balanced relationship the same applies to dads. If you\u2019re happy taking baby to the zoo without him and he doesn\u2019t mind missing this one and going again another time, I don\u2019t see the issue.", "Just go it\u2019s a good bonding experience for both of you because dad doesn\u2019t want to go fine. Go enjoy and bond. I love watching little kids pointing at the animals and whether anybody believes it or not they have a good time.", "[deleted]", "Yeah, look ahead to when your kid is older. He has events on the weekends - ball games, tournaments, scout trips, maybe he wants his parents to take him to the local amusement park. Is hubby going to miss all of that to watch football?\nNTA But give some serious thought to why you want to be married to this guy. It sounds like you're already a single parent.", "no...\"we WILL have a good time without you!\"", "Likewise!!! As a non American, I can never GET that game. Or the publicly sanctioned violence that comes with it", "At seven months, their vision is better than mine.", "It isnt a \"special\" game. It is every game.", "No, he doesn\u2019t gamble at all. The most stakes he has in it is a fantasy football league, no money buy-in or anything, just that the person that comes in last has to do something stupid as punishment", "I\u2019m not really sure who I would be showing him off too besides a bunch of strangers I don\u2019t know\u2026he\u2019s just a very active baby that loves animals and people watching, he coos and claps and I enjoy doing things with him that allows him to be entertained and happy.", "You must not have kids. If you do I feel sorry for them. This is a bonding experience. Better than sitting around in front of a TV."]}
