I'm the youngest in my family with 3 older siblings: Mindy (26F), Nelly (22F), and Darren (19M). \n\nMy parents love telling anyone who listens the story of my adoption, according to them \"they were my miracle\". Their story always goes something like this: \n\n\"after our 3rd child was born God told us to adopt! We decided to adopt from the country Randy's brother (my uncle) is a missionary in. Since that country is *so* poor it was no trouble finding children who needed to be adopted, but as we looked over our options we noticed a little Asian boy with a physical disability (that's me...). The orphanage told us that nobody was going to adopt the boy because of his birth defects, so out of the the kindness of *our* hearts we decided to adopt him!\" They'll then take their time listing my achievements (which aren't numerous) and talk about how without my adoption I would probably be this poor street kid in my birth country (that is, if I survived according to them).\n\nI've heard the story so many times while growing up, and for the longest time I struggled to figure out why I hated it so much. I hated that I was just another \"option\" for them when choosing who to adopt, I hated that I was their charity case, I hated that I was \"lucky\" a \"kind-hearted\" family decided to adopt me, I hated that I was from a country that I was raised to despise. I never told them this because they had never displayed a care for me before, often ignoring any signs that I needed help.\n\nThe last straw came when I transferred schools earlier this year. I had transferred out of the small, conservative private school into a large public school. I was just getting to know people and had made a quick stopped home with a friend to grab some cash so I could go out that night. It was only my parents at home and they insisted on talking to my friend so I went and got the money from my room in the basement and as I was coming back upstairs from my room I heard my adoptive mom telling my friend the story. I was upset, but pretended to not hear a thing as I came back up and quickly left with the friend.\n\nWhen I got home I got home I got in an argument with my parents which ended with me yelling that they just adopted me for attention and to feel good about themselves, not because they wanted to provide a stable home for a child who needed it. I ended up making my mom cry and my dad sent me to my room and told me we'll discuss my punishment later. Since then I've had other family members reach out to tell me that I was TA and was ungrateful for my parents kindness and now I don't know if I'm right.

Your parents seem to be milking this for all it\u2019s worth. \n\nBut at the same time, saying that adopting you for clout nullifies any care they gave you is going too far and is indeed ungrateful. Of course, parents owe their child a duty of care by providing basic necessities, education etc. but just because it\u2019s required of them doesn\u2019t mean that children don\u2019t need to show any sort of care or gratitude to their parents. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, you cannot deny that you have benefited from the adoption. As someone who lives in a third world country, trust me, it\u2019s better to be a white man\u2019s charity case than to live in an orphanage here. \n\nSometimes, the reason behind a person\u2019s actions can suck, but if you still benefit from the outcome, don\u2019t throw it back in their face just for your pride. Like, if a billionaire was going to donate a million dollars to an orphanage, it doesn\u2019t matter whether he\u2019s doing it out of the goodness of his heart or just to make himself look good. The orphans still benefit. \n\nYour feelings are valid. The way they talk about you is a recipe for resentment. But they are not horrible people. It sucks to feel like a charity case, but it would\u2019ve felt a whole lot worse if you weren\u2019t adopted.", "It's in my book that you don't- At least how that story comes off as, I wouldn't be telling it.\n\nNTA.\n\nI don't even like when my siblings are showing our cats off to friends, like they're not living animals. Like they're a \"trophy.\""]}
