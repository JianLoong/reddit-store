Your parents seem to be milking this for all it\u2019s worth. \n\nBut at the same time, saying that adopting you for clout nullifies any care they gave you is going too far and is indeed ungrateful. Of course, parents owe their child a duty of care by providing basic necessities, education etc. but just because it\u2019s required of them doesn\u2019t mean that children don\u2019t need to show any sort of care or gratitude to their parents. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, you cannot deny that you have benefited from the adoption. As someone who lives in a third world country, trust me, it\u2019s better to be a white man\u2019s charity case than to live in an orphanage here. \n\nSometimes, the reason behind a person\u2019s actions can suck, but if you still benefit from the outcome, don\u2019t throw it back in their face just for your pride. Like, if a billionaire was going to donate a million dollars to an orphanage, it doesn\u2019t matter whether he\u2019s doing it out of the goodness of his heart or just to make himself look good. The orphans still benefit. \n\nYour feelings are valid. The way they talk about you is a recipe for resentment. But they are not horrible people. It sucks to feel like a charity case, but it would\u2019ve felt a whole lot worse if you weren\u2019t adopted.", "It's in my book that you don't- At least how that story comes off as, I wouldn't be telling it.\n\nNTA.\n\nI don't even like when my siblings are showing our cats off to friends, like they're not living animals.

My baby bro was adopted. My family became a foster family when he was taken away and he was my brother the minute he came to us. He knows he was adopted and his bio family. He is our world! Even as adults I still make sure he is taken care of I am much much older than him. I am so sorry your family has treated you like this.", "NTA. You heard the story one too many times. I understand telling it when you were adopted but not noe", "NTA. Your parents sound horribly Narcissistic. Everything in this story is them, them, them. You could have been anyone else and the story would still be the same. This screams of someone trying to prove they aren't racist or terrible people because \"look see, we didn't HAVE to do this but we DID. Aren't we just great \nand so accepting and totally not racist/classist/etc\"\n\nHopefully at your new school you'll find supportive friends who can become your found family and help you remove yourself from your adoptive narcissist parents.", "NTA. The Situation is a bit more complex than you describe it I guess.

They should stop that. \n\nAlso, are you treated differently through the years? We need contrxt. And did your parents teach you despise your country of origin?", "NTA. With my due respect, your parents remind me YouTubers who record themselves giving money to beggars.\n\n\nOf course, adopting you was a nice thing.

And your parents should really turn the other cheek, right?", ">I never told them this because they had never displayed a care for me before, often ignoring any signs that I needed help.\n\nSounds like OP is treated more like a pet to show off in public but more or less left to their own devices at home.", "NTA. \n\n'I hated that I was just another \"option\" for them when choosing who to adopt, I hated that I was their charity case, I hated that I was \"lucky\" a \"kind-hearted\" family decided to adopt me, I hated that I was from a country that I was raised to despise.'\n\nI think this is 100% valid. Their words are making you feel this way; that's their responsibility, not yours.\n\nI hate this 'be grateful' crap. They CHOSE to adopt you. They are the adults here. Instead of talking about what you brought to their lives...it's all about them and how wonderful they think they are. \n\nYou know what?

Normality isn't part of the agenda.", "NTA.  It's hard to feel grateful when people are shoving their self-righteousness down your throat on a regular basis.  It is very telling that they say they were your miracle, instead of you being theirs.

I lucked out, I had a fantastic childhood that definitely would not have been possible with my birth mother (teen mom with no family support in the 80's in the rural south), but they never once made me feel like they \"saved\" me.

However they sound like they want pats on the back for saving the physically disabled minority boy from an unimaginable horror- like you were an abused dog that they rescued from a shelter. Can they not say 'From the moment we set eyes on you, we knew that God chose you to become part of our family'? \n\n*I've heard the story so many times while growing up, and for the longest time I struggled to figure out why I hated it so much. I hated that I was just another \"option\" for them when choosing who to adopt, I hated that I was their charity case, I hated that I was \"lucky\" a \"kind-hearted\" family decided to adopt me, I hated that I was from a country that I was raised to despise. I never told them this because they had never displayed a care for me before, often ignoring any signs that I needed help*\n\n*I ended up making my mom cry and my dad sent me to my room and told me we'll discuss my punishment later. Since then I've had other family members reach out to tell me that I was TA and was ungrateful for my parents kindness and now I don't know if I'm right.*\n\nWhy should you be grateful to feel like a charity case? Although they might not realize it, your parents are treating you like their special project. You should be grateful that the civilized white parents deemed you fit  enough to rescue you from your bad country. How dare you not appreciate their sacrifice?\n\nI think that you need some help in coping with your feelings towards your adoptive parents. You might have had a better material life her but they neglected your spiritual and emotional life. You can recognize that your quality of life would have been different in your country without despising the entire country. There is probably a rich cultural history that you haven't learned about. Their continual bringing up of their version of your adoption story just reinforces the fact that you are an outsider in the family and should be grateful for any scraps thrown your way. Please find your way to a qualified therapist.", "NTA\n\nSounds like a typical religious household to me. Lots of preachy bullshit.", "NTA for saying what you think but maybe have a talk with them. A lot of parents have differnt ways approaching things. They probably thought something else when they were talking about how they adopted you. If they dont understand your side, and you understanding theirs, then get ready to get out soon.", "NTA - I am an adoptive parent and come from a large family with many adoptions within it (both receiving and giving). Let's be honest here, a good portion, if not the majority, of children that are adopted are from backgrounds that have some level of instability or need. It's not a secret, and sure as sugar doesn't need to be an introduction every time you talk about your child.   \n\nI have run into parents like this. Like they deserve some sort of award for adopting a child from a 'situation'. It isn't a building block for a resume or fu\\*\\*ing step stool to social grace. Sometimes it comes from a place of pride in their child and how far they have come; sometimes from a place of superiority on what a great thing they have done; sometimes it is a bit of both. And often there is no malice intended, they simply have never stopped to think about the impact of what they are saying and how they are saying it. \n\nYou shouldn't have even had to have such a conversation in the first place, and I am sorry it took place in anger. If you can I would suggest writing your feelings out for them in a letter. I won't say apologize for making your mom cry (though yelling is never the best way to communicate and for that you might feel bad), but be open to the conversation and hopefully they are too. \n\nI say this knowing that often these types of stories aren't shared with malice, though the entitlement and narcissism sure isn't great, so hopefully they are just unaware of how it affects you, makes you feel and how it sounds. Not to mention how freaking inappropriate it is to share your story with your friends, never mind anyone else. I can guarantee that at least half, if not more, of the people they tell think they are entitled so-and-so's.  \n\nDo they share the story of your siblings medical diagnosis, their first doctor's appointment, or any of their personal information? This is the same thing - you, and your story, are not a hallmark card or parent award they can pull out and wave around whenever they damn well feel like it. \n\nIf you have the opportunity, and it seems they would be open, consider sharing my post. From one adoptive parent to another, it can be often difficult to comprehend the background of our chosen children simply because our own background, experience and/or privilege has never let us encounter anything similar. As parents, it is our job to support our children, but we are not perfect. What makes a good parent, even a good human, is recognizing our weaknesses or mistakes and modeling how to grow, adapt and change in positive ways. \n\nI hope that you and your family are able to come to a place of understanding that supports you all.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "No, sorry your partner has to go through that.", "[deleted]", "OP is really not responsible for mom's tears.", "It\u2019s hard to communicate your feelings in a healthy manner when you don\u2019t feel like it will be well received or that the recipients are safe to share your feelings with. OP specifically says he didn\u2019t ever say anything because he didn\u2019t feel like they cared. You don\u2019t open up to people when you feel neglected, because you know that if you do you\u2019re likely to get rejected or told you\u2019re wrong, and rejection hurts.\n\nOP\u2019s parents don\u2019t get to say \u201cWell it\u2019s your fault you feel this way, you never told us it hurt you.\u201d They are the parents.

But their whole perspective on the story (as told here) is racist and harmful to their child. I hope they will eventually understand this and change how they understand and tell their story. As it stands, I think it\u2019s totally acceptable for their child to say \u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell people about my adoption. It hurts me.\u201d A parent should not want to hurt their child. And again, I say this all as an adoptive parent who had thought a lot about how to talk about my journey to parenting my child.", "Yes, the child is responsible for his parents\u2019 feelings about being told the parents\u2019 behaviour negatively affecting him. Very reasonable. There isn\u2019t a ton of research and information out there to show how harmful saviour narratives around adoption are.

Is OP neglected or does he feel that way because of this long-standing unmet need?

There will always be someone worse off, doesn't mean that these parents didn't mistreat OP.  The arguments you're using, by the way, are exactly the kind of verbiage abusers use to prevent their victims from speaking out. I hope you never become a parent.", "The premise of their story sounds to be that they, benevolent and godly white people (I\u2019m assuming white based on adoption statistics and the circumstances of the adoption) went to a poor, destitute, godless country and rescues a pitiful little Asian child whose own people would have left him to suffer or die. Sounds like a racist premise to me, and one I\u2019ve seen many times within adoption circles.\n\nYes, I agree that the child would ideally have communicated to his parents earlier how and why the story hurt them. But he\u2019s a child. The parents should have done their own work to unlearn this racist framing for the benefit of their child (and the world). His parents are hurting him, he communicates that in a way that is not ideal but is the only way he can in this moment, and his parents blame and punish him for the way he\u2019s communicating rather than hearing what he\u2019s actually saying. Now that\u2019s an asshole move. \n\nYes, he can apologize for lashing out\u2026but they have to really take in what he\u2019s saying or this issue will never resolve. It sounds like they would all benefit from structured, mediated conversations with a licensed, adoption informed therapist.", "The argument *ended* with OP yelling, which probably means that he started out with \"healthy\" communication but got frustrated because his parents weren't hearing him. \n\nAnd also, unless he's literally being spiteful or aggressive or something, he's allowed to communicate his anger with yelling. What his parents have been doing to him all his life- making him feel less than because of his race, disability nationality and circumstances, and treating him like a little project is utterly foul. He's not some kid from the 80s with parents who didn't know better, these parents adopted him in the time of the internet and many books on adoption, and still treated him appallingly. \n\nPeople are not robots, like Jesus, what exactly is communicating 'healthily' to you about this level of mistreatment?", "LOL OK", "[deleted]", "Talk about over dramatic. \u201cI hope you never become a parent.\u201d Reddit losers and copy paste statements name a better duo. \n\nUnfortunately all the good points you made mean nothing now.", "I'm not going to call someone a racist on the presumption of their race. I don't think that's fair or right to do.\n\nAs for their framing of the store. Yes, their framing of it that they are saviors to OP is the major issue here. However, let's not act like what they are saying is completely untrue. Disabled children have hard times getting adopted. The process is harder. There are more financial costs to raising a disabled child but that shouldn't be the focal point of the story which it comes off as.\n\nI'll give the parents the benefit of the doubt they'd listen OP doesn't paint a picture of neglect.

How are they supposed to know it's wrong\".

I can see why OP would feel that way though. I've been in that boat where something is hurting you and you feel like no one cares. For me, I just wasn't expressing that. \n\nIdk why you think I'm not giving OP grace. I haven't said anything bad about OP.
