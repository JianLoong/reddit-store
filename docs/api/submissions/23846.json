Since that country is *so* poor it was no trouble finding children who needed to be adopted, but as we looked over our options we noticed a little Asian boy with a physical disability (that's me...).

I hated that I was just another \"option\" for them when choosing who to adopt, I hated that I was their charity case, I hated that I was \"lucky\" a \"kind-hearted\" family decided to adopt me, I hated that I was from a country that I was raised to despise.

I had transferred out of the small, conservative private school into a large public school. I was just getting to know people and had made a quick stopped home with a friend to grab some cash so I could go out that night. It was only my parents at home and they insisted on talking to my friend so I went and got the money from my room in the basement and as I was coming back upstairs from my room I heard my adoptive mom telling my friend the story. I was upset, but pretended to not hear a thing as I came back up and quickly left with the friend.\n\nWhen I got home I got home I got in an argument with my parents which ended with me yelling that they just adopted me for attention and to feel good about themselves, not because they wanted to provide a stable home for a child who needed it. I ended up making my mom cry and my dad sent me to my room and told me we'll discuss my punishment later.

Your parents seem to be milking this for all it\u2019s worth. \n\nBut at the same time, saying that adopting you for clout nullifies any care they gave you is going too far and is indeed ungrateful. Of course, parents owe their child a duty of care by providing basic necessities, education etc. but just because it\u2019s required of them doesn\u2019t mean that children don\u2019t need to show any sort of care or gratitude to their parents. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, you cannot deny that you have benefited from the adoption. As someone who lives in a third world country, trust me, it\u2019s better to be a white man\u2019s charity case than to live in an orphanage here. \n\nSometimes, the reason behind a person\u2019s actions can suck, but if you still benefit from the outcome, don\u2019t throw it back in their face just for your pride. Like, if a billionaire was going to donate a million dollars to an orphanage, it doesn\u2019t matter whether he\u2019s doing it out of the goodness of his heart or just to make himself look good. The orphans still benefit. \n\nYour feelings are valid. The way they talk about you is a recipe for resentment. But they are not horrible people. It sucks to feel like a charity case, but it would\u2019ve felt a whole lot worse if you weren\u2019t adopted.", "It's in my book that you don't- At least how that story comes off as, I wouldn't be telling it.\n\nNTA.\n\nI don't even like when my siblings are showing our cats off to friends, like they're not living animals. Like they're a \"trophy.\"", "NTA. Fuck that white saviorism ableist nonsense. I\u2019m sorry that your parents suck.", "NTA - but you better start looking at ways to save cash and financially take care of yourself\n\nBecause freshly, if you're right, and you called them out, what's to stop them from abandoning you?", "NTA this is horrible! My baby bro was adopted. My family became a foster family when he was taken away and he was my brother the minute he came to us. He knows he was adopted and his bio family. He is our world! Even as adults I still make sure he is taken care of I am much much older than him. I am so sorry your family has treated you like this.", "NTA. You heard the story one too many times. I understand telling it when you were adopted but not noe", "NTA. Your parents sound horribly Narcissistic. Everything in this story is them, them, them. You could have been anyone else and the story would still be the same. This screams of someone trying to prove they aren't racist or terrible people because \"look see, we didn't HAVE to do this but we DID. Aren't we just great \nand so accepting and totally not racist/classist/etc\"\n\nHopefully at your new school you'll find supportive friends who can become your found family and help you remove yourself from your adoptive narcissist parents.", "NTA. The Situation is a bit more complex than you describe it I guess. But i do not thinl your feeling are invalid.\n\nHowever the Story how your parents describe adopting you (\"god told us to\" - like sure, the Almighty spoke to you directly. Everyone jealous?) Sucks. They should stop that. \n\nAlso, are you treated differently through the years? We need contrxt. And did your parents teach you despise your country of origin?", "NTA. With my due respect, your parents remind me YouTubers who record themselves giving money to beggars.\n\n\nOf course, adopting you was a nice thing. But if they need to brag about it to everyone, there's something fishy and not honest.", "NTA. And your parents should really turn the other cheek, right?", ">I never told them this because they had never displayed a care for me before, often ignoring any signs that I needed help.\n\nSounds like OP is treated more like a pet to show off in public but more or less left to their own devices at home.", "NTA. \n\n'I hated that I was just another \"option\" for them when choosing who to adopt, I hated that I was their charity case, I hated that I was \"lucky\" a \"kind-hearted\" family decided to adopt me, I hated that I was from a country that I was raised to despise.'\n\nI think this is 100% valid. Their words are making you feel this way; that's their responsibility, not yours.\n\nI hate this 'be grateful' crap. They CHOSE to adopt you. They are the adults here. Instead of talking about what you brought to their lives...it's all about them and how wonderful they think they are. \n\nYou know what? If they punish you for stating how you feel as a result of their behaviour, fine. But I don't believe you should apologise to them.", "When you adopt a child you should be overjoyed that YOU have the chance to make this child a part of your family. The child is a gift to the parents. Not the other way around.\n\nYou have been left feeling beholden to these people. Like it is your job to be grateful for their charity. You hit the nail on the head with all their virtue signalling. \n\nYou have been raised to look down on the place you came from. Perhaps now is the time to explore what will undoubtedly be the rich culture of your place of birth. You are worthwhile in and of yourself. The behaviour of your adoptive family is really awful and does not follow the teachings of Christianity (if I am correct in assuming that is their religion). \n\nI am sorry you are experiencing this. I hope you can build you self esteem.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  When they start telling the story just interrupt and say \u201cyeah yeah, they get it,  you guys were so amazing to take me, the poor little disabled boy\u2026\u201d. Make sure you say it in a very bored and disinterested voice.  This will embarrass them and hopefully, after several times, they will stop doing this.  \n\nYou should make the most of your life and live a long and happy life.  Go to school, get your own family, and somewhat pull away from your family.  Be happy.", "I'm so sorry. You're NTA and I think you're exactly right and that's why your adoptive mom was crying. She knew you were telling the truth!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I ended up making my mom cry and my dad sent me to my room and told me we'll discuss my punishment later.\" .. you hit a nerve there.", "NTA, but you should sit down with your adoptive mother and father and explain that it makes you feel unwanted, like you were a charity case. And that it is wildly inappropriate to tell that type of story to your school mates. I'm sure this will prompt some drama from your adoptive mother, but best to clear the air and provide your perspective.", "NTA Because you're right that's why they did it initially. But please try to keep in mind that it's possible they could have grown to love you as well over time, OP. I do hope for your sake they've grown as individuals since then... but I guess there's also a possibility that they haven't.", "NTA.. this is too much..", "NTA.", "NTA, oh my GOSH. NTA NTA NTA. You\u2019re a person!", "NTA but your parents sure are. They've objectified you. \n\nDo you have plans for college? I think you should consider going somewhere a few hours away where you can live in the dorms. Don't let these people use you as a token forever. \n\nIf your parents are hyper conservative Christians, I have to recommend that you apologize to them and try to keep your head down until you're ready to leave home. I am concerned that they might decide that the more open public school is a bad influence and they might try to isolate you or send you somewhere. \n\n\nJust keep your head down, do your best in school, get help from your guidance counselor for college applications/trade school/whatever calls you, and quietly prepare to leave.", "NTA. A lot of religious people do good and charitable things for perverted reasons-- such as gaining imaginary \"moral superiority tokens\" that they can lord over other people to make themselves feel like god's favorite \"good people.\"\nYou've let it be known that them waving your childhood circumstances over your head to make themselves look good to everyone else bothers you, and they want to punish you for ruining their morality boner.", "NTA but maybe sit them down and tell them how you feel instead of yelling at them. They probably are proud and think they\u2019re coming off one way when they definitely aren\u2019t but hopefully they love you enough to stop", "NTA, you've been way kinder than they deserved.\nAnd since everybody here already told you a lot of useful stuff, I just can add one thing: next time remember them God does not love the braggers", "There seems to be a \u201cwhite\u201d Christian savior vibe to their story. \u201dWe took this poor, disabled brown child no one wanted because God told us to.\u201d It feels kind of gross and exploitative.", "Best description so far.\n\nThey brag about their accomplishment, not their kid.", "NTA but you're dealing with people who do missionary work and claim God speaks to them. Normality isn't part of the agenda.", "NTA.  It's hard to feel grateful when people are shoving their self-righteousness down your throat on a regular basis.  It is very telling that they say they were your miracle, instead of you being theirs.  Perhaps remind them of Matthew 6, verses 1-2:\n\n**1: \"Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.**\n\n**2: \"So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by men.**", "As an adoptive mum I hate this.\n\nWhen people find out I adopted they tell me how amazing it is and how I am selfless whereas actually it was selfish in my view - I wanted to be a mum, I wanted to enrich my life by having children. Having my girls was the best decision I ever made and they make me smile like no one else can.\n\nWhen my girls are old enough to understand (they know they are adopted but only 5&6) it will be so difficult for them and I know that they will have lots of questions and that breaks my heart they will have to deal with that. Their private stories are their own and I will continue to feed them age appropriate information- it is for them and only them to decide who is allowed to know their stories. It\u2019s a gross violation of your privacy.\n\nNTA", "Messiah complexes much from your parents?\n\nNTA- you are rising valid reasons to feel unwell with their story telling. They sabotaged any chance of you genuinely feeling grateful or glad to be part of this family by claiming it as owned to them from the beginning. Quite sad they are clinging to it instead of making it real.", "NTA.  Op your parents  are gross and they are being extremely bad parents by bragging how they \"saved\" you.\n\nYou're 17.  I would start making plans quietly for your escape", "Yep, you're TA.\n\nThey may be ridiculous in telling people the story, my opinion is why ever mention any details to anyone? However, is there anything they are saying that is not true?\n\nIf you were not adopted, what sort of future would you have had?\n\nThe life you have now was delivered to you how and by whom?", "NTA. They should be treating you like their biological children, treating you with dignity, not as a charity case who needs to be grateful. When they calm down, explain your feelings to them, maybe they'll understand.\n\nAlso, a lot of adoptees experience this sort of thing. You can search online for support and advice. I think there are even some subreddits for adoptees.", "NTA. Your parents have White Savior Syndrome (tm). They are treating you like a pet. To ever tell that story in front of you is an additional level of AH.", "NTA\n\nI'm not adopted. But I'd be really upset too if my mom viewed me and described my life based on things from when I was too young to remember. It would make me feel like \"am I not anything else to you? Just a personal anecdote? You know nothing of who I am as a person today that you're proud of me for and want to tell people about??\"", "NTA your parents are clout chasing chauvinist imperialists, I am so sorry for all the trauma they have undoubtedly inflicted on you.", "NTA! There are alot of different ways to tell that story and they chose the main character syndrome version every. Time. \n\nYour adoption is about YOU. They were lucky to have found you. They were blessed that you turned out to be an amazing person. Not because they are so amazing but because you are who you are OP.\n\nAlso, why constantly tell that story to everyone?

Your parents sound toxic, and I would definitely recommend getting out of there early.", "NTA- You're a person, not a project they can brag about. You're absolutely allowed to be upset by how they're talking about you, and I encourage you to find support groups and networks for adopted persons. There are some good tiktokers that talk about the bullshit surrounding adoption as well", "NTA - I'm also adopted (from within the US and a lot older than you) and my parents always made the story sound the other way around, that they were so lucky to have gotten me, that they wanted a baby so bad (my mom couldn't have kids)and were so happy to have been able to adopt me. I lucked out, I had a fantastic childhood that definitely would not have been possible with my birth mother (teen mom with no family support in the 80's in the rural south), but they never once made me feel like they \"saved\" me. We are a family and that's that.", "NTA, I can't stand people like that. It actually made my stomach hurt reading this. Your parents are deeply wrong about this and it will likely take a serious conversation with them (writing out your thoughts and giving it to them may help) and some time for them to restructure their worldview. If they are good people, they will change. I hope they are ultimately good people for your sake, OP. \n\nAlso, get vocal to your supports. If you get along with your siblings, tell them your perspective and ask them not to retell your story. They may also be able to speak up to your parents when they hear your parents continuing to cross that boundary. The same goes for other friends or family members that you can talk to\n\nFor context- my three kids are adopted, but not internationally. My husband and I have no biological kids by choice. The amount of people going through foster care classes with us who had the same 'savior' mentality you described is disgusting", "NTA. I\u2019m an adoptive parent and I hope my child would be that honest with me if I were hurting them. It will likely be a long road for them to understand how wrong their perspective is, but I hope they can at least understand how harmful it is to you when they tell this story. Your story is yours and you should be able to decide when and how to share it. I also hope you have people in your corner IRL and are able to connect with fellow adoptees online. There are many great educators and communities on Facebook/Instagram/TikTok/Reddit, etc.", "NTA, you don't need to be grateful your parents adopted you anymore than a biological child needs to feel grateful her parents had her. Your parents are being uhhh extremely fucking racist. I recommend looking up literature about transracial adoption -- there's quite a bit written by people who grew up in a similar situation as you. Nicole Chung might be a good person to start with.", "Sounds a bit like my partner's supposed parents.\n\nYou're not Bristol, uk way by any chance?", "I\u2019d highly recommend checking out Adoptee Mentoring Society (AMS) at adopteementorship.org or reading Angela Tucker\u2019s book You Should Be Grateful. You have every right to be furious about your parents co-opting your story. AMS has virtual lounges for adoptees facilitated by adoptees where you can build community and share your experiences while being heard and validated. Take care of yourself.", "Not only that, but I applaud OP for his timing of making the argument! At 17, I struggled with being able to calmly wait for the right time. I wasn\u2019t always my best. OP, you nailed it!", "And then they will wonder why OP doesn\u2019t spend time with them when he\u2019s is no longer their tax write-off.

The parents wanted another child, and they got to pluck one out of thin air. If anything OP did *them* a nice thing, by granting their wish for a child. \n\nTo be clear. I don\u2019t think adoption is a bad thing. But it\u2019s beneficial for the parents. It\u2019s not a favor that they do.", "I have had higher educational expectations set for me than my siblings, according to my parents it's because I can handle them but I think it might just be because they're feeding into the stereotype that Asians are smart. They also expect me to get into a good college on full ride and as such have told me that \"under no circumstance will we help you pay for college\" while they've paid for my siblings to go.  And to answer your second question, they never were like \"you should hate your country of origin\", but they would constantly talk about how I was from a \"godless hellhole\" and that that place is \"teeming with thieves and other criminals\"", "And \" uncle\" is busy converting the heathens in OP's country of origin which I bet is no longer poor or under developed.", "no they didn\u2019t.  but they did-they don\u2019t get to hold it over their child\u2019s head for the rest of their life, or pretend the kid is lucky to have food, clothes, shelter, etc. that is called parenting and if they were never going to provide those things, then they shouldn\u2019t have adopted or became parents.", "You're absolutely right. Thank you for reminding me all this.", "This is horrible. They are, 100%, treating you differently, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're using their racist bias of the smart asian kid as an excuse to not pay for your college. Also, they're racist AF and ableist and saying those things about your country is unhinged. You're feelings are valid, I suggest you look for groups of interracial adoptees, you will have your feelings validated.", "Sound's like my wife's supposed parents. They adopted her but when it became clear she had certain disabilities they neglected her, threatened anyone who was concerned they'd get them kicked out of church, and then when she was taken away, threatened the family that cared about her that they'd never see their biological grandchildren if they tried to get in contact with her.", "Sounds like OP is a teenager...with the perspective of a teenager. We're getting a distorted perspective of what happened, I'm surprised so few commenters are taking that into account. OP is TA, but that doesn't mean his parents can't learn to be more respectful of yelling OPs story.", "OP is lucky. Lots of kids dont get adopted. Im sure they would all kill to be in OPs shoes. Sure they back-pat themselves but i would call this holding over OPs head. If this is their biggest issue in life they are 100% lucky."]}
