I'm the youngest in my family with 3 older siblings: Mindy (26F), Nelly (22F), and Darren (19M). \n\nMy parents love telling anyone who listens the story of my adoption, according to them \"they were my miracle\". Their story always goes something like this: \n\n\"after our 3rd child was born God told us to adopt! We decided to adopt from the country Randy's brother (my uncle) is a missionary in. Since that country is *so* poor it was no trouble finding children who needed to be adopted, but as we looked over our options we noticed a little Asian boy with a physical disability (that's me...). The orphanage told us that nobody was going to adopt the boy because of his birth defects, so out of the the kindness of *our* hearts we decided to adopt him!\" They'll then take their time listing my achievements (which aren't numerous) and talk about how without my adoption I would probably be this poor street kid in my birth country (that is, if I survived according to them).\n\nI've heard the story so many times while growing up, and for the longest time I struggled to figure out why I hated it so much. I hated that I was just another \"option\" for them when choosing who to adopt, I hated that I was their charity case, I hated that I was \"lucky\" a \"kind-hearted\" family decided to adopt me, I hated that I was from a country that I was raised to despise. I never told them this because they had never displayed a care for me before, often ignoring any signs that I needed help.\n\nThe last straw came when I transferred schools earlier this year. I had transferred out of the small, conservative private school into a large public school. I was just getting to know people and had made a quick stopped home with a friend to grab some cash so I could go out that night. It was only my parents at home and they insisted on talking to my friend so I went and got the money from my room in the basement and as I was coming back upstairs from my room I heard my adoptive mom telling my friend the story. I was upset, but pretended to not hear a thing as I came back up and quickly left with the friend.\n\nWhen I got home I got home I got in an argument with my parents which ended with me yelling that they just adopted me for attention and to feel good about themselves, not because they wanted to provide a stable home for a child who needed it. I ended up making my mom cry and my dad sent me to my room and told me we'll discuss my punishment later. Since then I've had other family members reach out to tell me that I was TA and was ungrateful for my parents kindness and now I don't know if I'm right.

Your parents seem to be milking this for all it\u2019s worth. \n\nBut at the same time, saying that adopting you for clout nullifies any care they gave you is going too far and is indeed ungrateful. Of course, parents owe their child a duty of care by providing basic necessities, education etc. but just because it\u2019s required of them doesn\u2019t mean that children don\u2019t need to show any sort of care or gratitude to their parents. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, you cannot deny that you have benefited from the adoption. As someone who lives in a third world country, trust me, it\u2019s better to be a white man\u2019s charity case than to live in an orphanage here. \n\nSometimes, the reason behind a person\u2019s actions can suck, but if you still benefit from the outcome, don\u2019t throw it back in their face just for your pride. Like, if a billionaire was going to donate a million dollars to an orphanage, it doesn\u2019t matter whether he\u2019s doing it out of the goodness of his heart or just to make himself look good. The orphans still benefit. \n\nYour feelings are valid. The way they talk about you is a recipe for resentment. But they are not horrible people. It sucks to feel like a charity case, but it would\u2019ve felt a whole lot worse if you weren\u2019t adopted.", "It's in my book that you don't- At least how that story comes off as, I wouldn't be telling it.\n\nNTA.\n\nI don't even like when my siblings are showing our cats off to friends, like they're not living animals. Like they're a \"trophy.\"", "NTA. Fuck that white saviorism ableist nonsense. I\u2019m sorry that your parents suck.", "NTA - but you better start looking at ways to save cash and financially take care of yourself\n\nBecause freshly, if you're right, and you called them out, what's to stop them from abandoning you?", "NTA this is horrible! My baby bro was adopted. My family became a foster family when he was taken away and he was my brother the minute he came to us. He knows he was adopted and his bio family. He is our world! Even as adults I still make sure he is taken care of I am much much older than him. I am so sorry your family has treated you like this.", "NTA. You heard the story one too many times. I understand telling it when you were adopted but not noe", "NTA. Your parents sound horribly Narcissistic. Everything in this story is them, them, them. You could have been anyone else and the story would still be the same. This screams of someone trying to prove they aren't racist or terrible people because \"look see, we didn't HAVE to do this but we DID. Aren't we just great \nand so accepting and totally not racist/classist/etc\"\n\nHopefully at your new school you'll find supportive friends who can become your found family and help you remove yourself from your adoptive narcissist parents.", "NTA. The Situation is a bit more complex than you describe it I guess. But i do not thinl your feeling are invalid.\n\nHowever the Story how your parents describe adopting you (\"god told us to\" - like sure, the Almighty spoke to you directly. Everyone jealous?) Sucks. They should stop that. \n\nAlso, are you treated differently through the years? We need contrxt. And did your parents teach you despise your country of origin?", "NTA. With my due respect, your parents remind me YouTubers who record themselves giving money to beggars.\n\n\nOf course, adopting you was a nice thing. But if they need to brag about it to everyone, there's something fishy and not honest.", "NTA. And your parents should really turn the other cheek, right?", ">I never told them this because they had never displayed a care for me before, often ignoring any signs that I needed help.\n\nSounds like OP is treated more like a pet to show off in public but more or less left to their own devices at home.", "NTA. \n\n'I hated that I was just another \"option\" for them when choosing who to adopt, I hated that I was their charity case, I hated that I was \"lucky\" a \"kind-hearted\" family decided to adopt me, I hated that I was from a country that I was raised to despise.'\n\nI think this is 100% valid. Their words are making you feel this way; that's their responsibility, not yours.\n\nI hate this 'be grateful' crap. They CHOSE to adopt you. They are the adults here. Instead of talking about what you brought to their lives...it's all about them and how wonderful they think they are. \n\nYou know what? If they punish you for stating how you feel as a result of their behaviour, fine. But I don't believe you should apologise to them.", "When you adopt a child you should be overjoyed that YOU have the chance to make this child a part of your family. The child is a gift to the parents. Not the other way around.\n\nYou have been left feeling beholden to these people. Like it is your job to be grateful for their charity. You hit the nail on the head with all their virtue signalling. \n\nYou have been raised to look down on the place you came from. Perhaps now is the time to explore what will undoubtedly be the rich culture of your place of birth. You are worthwhile in and of yourself. The behaviour of your adoptive family is really awful and does not follow the teachings of Christianity (if I am correct in assuming that is their religion). \n\nI am sorry you are experiencing this. I hope you can build you self esteem.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  When they start telling the story just interrupt and say \u201cyeah yeah, they get it,  you guys were so amazing to take me, the poor little disabled boy\u2026\u201d. Make sure you say it in a very bored and disinterested voice.  This will embarrass them and hopefully, after several times, they will stop doing this.  \n\nYou should make the most of your life and live a long and happy life.  Go to school, get your own family, and somewhat pull away from your family.  Be happy.", "I'm so sorry. You're NTA and I think you're exactly right and that's why your adoptive mom was crying. She knew you were telling the truth!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I ended up making my mom cry and my dad sent me to my room and told me we'll discuss my punishment later.\" .. you hit a nerve there.", "NTA, but you should sit down with your adoptive mother and father and explain that it makes you feel unwanted, like you were a charity case. And that it is wildly inappropriate to tell that type of story to your school mates. I'm sure this will prompt some drama from your adoptive mother, but best to clear the air and provide your perspective.", "NTA Because you're right that's why they did it initially. But please try to keep in mind that it's possible they could have grown to love you as well over time, OP. I do hope for your sake they've grown as individuals since then... but I guess there's also a possibility that they haven't.", "NTA.. this is too much..", "NTA.", "NTA, oh my GOSH. NTA NTA NTA. You\u2019re a person!", "NTA but your parents sure are. They've objectified you. \n\nDo you have plans for college? I think you should consider going somewhere a few hours away where you can live in the dorms. Don't let these people use you as a token forever. \n\nIf your parents are hyper conservative Christians, I have to recommend that you apologize to them and try to keep your head down until you're ready to leave home. I am concerned that they might decide that the more open public school is a bad influence and they might try to isolate you or send you somewhere. \n\n\nJust keep your head down, do your best in school, get help from your guidance counselor for college applications/trade school/whatever calls you, and quietly prepare to leave.", "NTA. A lot of religious people do good and charitable things for perverted reasons-- such as gaining imaginary \"moral superiority tokens\" that they can lord over other people to make themselves feel like god's favorite \"good people.\"\nYou've let it be known that them waving your childhood circumstances over your head to make themselves look good to everyone else bothers you, and they want to punish you for ruining their morality boner.", "NTA but maybe sit them down and tell them how you feel instead of yelling at them. They probably are proud and think they\u2019re coming off one way when they definitely aren\u2019t but hopefully they love you enough to stop", "NTA, you've been way kinder than they deserved.\nAnd since everybody here already told you a lot of useful stuff, I just can add one thing: next time remember them God does not love the braggers", "There seems to be a \u201cwhite\u201d Christian savior vibe to their story. \u201dWe took this poor, disabled brown child no one wanted because God told us to.\u201d It feels kind of gross and exploitative.", "Best description so far.\n\nThey brag about their accomplishment, not their kid."]}
