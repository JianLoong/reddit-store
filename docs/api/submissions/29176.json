The project was about the timeline of Swedens economy during the 21st century presented in a 5-10 minute long video.\n\nI was paired with Gustav (15m), Fiona (15f) and Alice (14f) who are all known for being late, \u201csick\u201d or not working. \n\nThe first days were as expected not very active, even I did nothing. I realised that I would have to do something about it and called them about it. They all accused me of trying to push the responsibility of the project onto them so I wouldn\u2019t have to to anything. After this I just began researching about the topic and all that jazz so that we would get somewhere.\n\nI made a group chat with them and asked \u201cHey, I need you guys to pull your weight a little and actually work for once\u201d and they ignored it. All I got was a meme two hours later from Gustav. I just began laying out and planning the shots for the video.\n\nA week before the project was due I tried talking to them about hanging around after school to work on the project since it was going to be a big part of our grade but I couldn\u2019t get their attention since afterward they didn\u2019t come to the designated place where we would do it, the library.\n\nI finished the shots for the video and began editing it and recording voiceover when my friend called and asked how it was going. \u201cPretty shit, my group partners have bailed on me and all work is on me so, yeah\u201d I responded. He told me that my group partners, who were supposed to be helping me with the project, had gone out partying. I was livid hearing about this and vented at my friend for a bit until I just hung up out of frustration.\n\nIt took three days for my OCD to let the video be acceptable to show. To solve the person problem, I just edited another one of me in those shots where it was necessary (I do a lot of editing so I know this stuff). But then I realized something.       \n\nI decide what goes in the video. \n\nIn the credits of the video I put my name on everything and my partners names on \u201cdid absolutely nothing \u201c. The day of the presentation came and I played the video with my partners just looking at their phones. Whenever I was on screen twice I heard the occasional giggle and the room erupted with laughter from everyone when the credits rolled. \n\nAfter the presentation my partners pulled me aside and told me \u201cyou asshole\u201d and went to the teacher. I explained my side of the story and I got the equivalent of an A and my partners got to redo the entire project. \n\nI think I acted accordingly but my \u201cpartners\u201d think I\u2019m an asshole for failing them. I can see their point of view but I never lied about anything and I told them that they needed to help out.

They did nothing and received their nothing grade. The only \"point\" they have is that you took an action that harmed them. The problem is that's false. \n\nNow as to your credits addition, yeah maybe that falls under the petty revenge category; and I could understand, while completely not giving a shit, why that bothered them. \n\nBut since they're more mad about \"you failing them,\" I'd say you're in the clear. You didn't fail them, they failed themselves.", "NTA.\n\nThey got the same grade as the effort they put in: zero.", "Lmao I was you in high school. Nta. The fact they didn\u2019t see the video they \u201cmade\u201d is not on you.", "NTA. Had the same thing happen to me in college. Was paired with a guy who never showed up to class, or showed up and did nothing. He would sit at his computer surfing the internet while I plugged away on the project. In the end, the teacher graded us individually instead of as a group. I got an A, my partner failed the class. \n\nYour \"partners\" have no room to talk. They were hoping to take credit without doing the work. Good on you for not letting them have it.", "NTA, lol this belongs in petty revenge. I probably would have told the teacher before the presentation to see if they could step in and were aware of the situation.", "Lmao they didn't even watch it before presenting? If they had they'd have seen the credits. Nta", "NTA - Actions have consequences.\n\nNice touch with the credits.", "Absolutely NTA! It's as simple as you did the hard work, you get the benefits and you did. As for your former partners, they are TA, massively. So ignorance would be the way forward for you.", "NTA, and why I despise group projects.", "Nta - this is typically how group projects go though. It\u2019s why student don\u2019t like them.  If you can, then just pick the best group possible - fill it with the most committed students.", "NTA - you did all the work, you should get all the credit.  You gave them several opportunities to step up and do their part but they ignored you and straight up ditched you. They planned all along for you to do all the work and thought they would still get credit. You taught them a valuable lesson!!! Tell them to go kick rocks!!!", "NTA.  I don't think it's how I'd have handled it, but it's possibly better.  They certainly deserved what they got, in any event.", "NTA!  \nIt was a group project and they let you do it alone even though your tried to get their cooperation...\n\nI assume in the past they have gotten away with this kind of behaviour and still got a grade so they were just trusting you will let it go and put their names anyway...\n\nWhat you did is petty but well deserved!", "NTA. \n\nI've dealt with people like this in graduate school. It does not go away.  We kept the professor informed the whole time, so he knew. The other contributing group members were more merciful than I am and didn't let me take his name off the presentation entirely, but we made damn sure the prof knew who had done what. And this dude couldn't get anyone to work with him later, he did this to everyone and burned every single bridge possible. Your groupmates fucked around and are now finding out. You're fine.", "NTA\n\nBut probably would've been advisable to just show the commitment they showed to your teacher and let them decide.", "ESH....they should have pulled their weight with the project and didn't. You should have kept the teacher updated about their lack of involvement throughout the project. IMHO, you went about this the wrong way and deserved being called an AH by your group project mates.", "This is why the smarter teachers put a group marking system where the members can grade each other on their contribution into group projects. Heck, for the biggest group project I had in highschool, the teacher not only had this system in place but also checked in with me to make sure my group was pulling their weight. Small school, shortage of A students, and my group members had loudly called \u201cshotgun\u201d on me when the project was announced so he had concerns. The group marking system determined what percentage of the project grade they actually got. It worked out, as there was a firm understanding between us that I would make sure the project was A level, but they would be doing all the crap I didn\u2019t enjoy. Sadly, once I went to university I found the profs expected everyone to be an adult and pull their own weight - leaving you no way to cut the dead weight out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would have probably tried nagging them to do more, but you nailed the presentation.\n\nAre you sure you're 15?", "NTA\n\nGood for you for calling them out on their lazy behaviors.  They probably laughed about it while they were partying.", "NTA, also hilarious. I wish I would have done this in school.", "You came here to brag.  But I don't care.  Nta!", "NTA, of course your partners are upset. But that\u2019s on them. I\u2019m glad your teacher recognized this and gave you the credit while making them redo it", "Deserves. You aren\u2019t the ahole", "NTA\n\nYou didn't fail them, they failed themselves. It was also very generous of your teacher to let them redo the project instead of giving them an F so hopefully the learned a valuable lesson.", "NTA....but you should have gone to the teacher and explained what was going on. If anything, it would have showed you recognized a problem and went to the available resources (teacher), since you weren't able to rectify (contain the group dynamic) on your own. Teacher probably would have forced them to participate with threat of failing. Or just have you continue on your own.\n\nWhen things like this happen (group projects gone south), I always view it as a leadership issue. If you can manage to get everyone together, you're a good leader. If it all falls apart, either it was poor leadership, or a mess to begin with.\n\nThis happened to me in college. One girl was simply not pulling her weight, I went to the professor and explained. I tried to talk with her, even gave her small items to work on to include her. Ultimately, the professor removed her from the group and I think she just got a zero for her part. I was a good leader for those who stayed, but not good enough to convince the other one to pull her weight.\n\nYour partners were simply lazy and expected you to do all the work.", "NTA- They deserved it", "NTA  Your partners are major AH. They did NOTHING", "NTA \nFolks that don't work shouldn't get any credit, period. Its important to acknowledge your own value.", "I just want to say, through a nose of water that just shot out from laughing so hard, that you're NTA. They did you dirty and you cleaned plate. They had no credit cuz they did nothing. Simple.", "NTA. Group projects in school are always garbage and I believe should be outlawed. They don't serve a purpose except to have one person in the group do an entire project by themselves", "NTA. This also happened to me in high school (about 100 years ago!). I had a partner for a project, who did nothing. I planned the project, gave him his share to work on, and, like I said, he didn't do a single thing. On the day the project was due, I turned in my share and explained to the teacher that half the project was missing due to the other guy's lack of effort. She was going to fail both of us because \"it was a group project\". I talked her into giving me a A for my portion but she felt like she also had to give the slacker (who was a star football player) an A as well. \n\nThe jock was a good-looking football player who was used to having girls do all of his homework and was surprised when I didn't do his share of the work. The teacher was a woman who told me that I didn't understand the pressure she was under not to give the jock a failing grade. Sheesh.\n\nEnd of the story: jock went on to a semi-successful NFL career but now is suffering from possible CTE. It's not karma or anything, just a sad ending.", "NTA. It's the classic story of the hen making bread -- if you didn't help, then you don't get any of the bread. Why the fuck did they feel like they deserved part of that grade?", "lol same thing happened to my in 9th grade. I ended up doing a solid 85% of the work, one person helped me for like ten minutes. 15% person gave five of his percent to someone else, the other got zero. NTA. Group projects are designed to show this. I\u2019m guessing your teacher assigned you this specific group on purpose.", "They got another chance tho, so they technically didn\u2019t even fail", "Remember to type 'NTA' so your vote gets counted", "My bad, cheers for that"]}
