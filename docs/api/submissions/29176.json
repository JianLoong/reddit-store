If you can, then just pick the best group possible - fill it with the most committed students.", "NTA - you did all the work, you should get all the credit.

Small school, shortage of A students, and my group members had loudly called \u201cshotgun\u201d on me when the project was announced so he had concerns. The group marking system determined what percentage of the project grade they actually got. It worked out, as there was a firm understanding between us that I would make sure the project was A level, but they would be doing all the crap I didn\u2019t enjoy.

I would have probably tried nagging them to do more, but you nailed the presentation.\n\nAre you sure you're 15?", "NTA\n\nGood for you for calling them out on their lazy behaviors.  They probably laughed about it while they were partying.", "NTA, also hilarious. I wish I would have done this in school.", "You came here to brag.  But I don't care.  Nta!", "NTA, of course your partners are upset. But that\u2019s on them. I\u2019m glad your teacher recognized this and gave you the credit while making them redo it", "Deserves. You aren\u2019t the ahole", "NTA\n\nYou didn't fail them, they failed themselves. It was also very generous of your teacher to let them redo the project instead of giving them an F so hopefully the learned a valuable lesson.", "NTA....but you should have gone to the teacher and explained what was going on. If anything, it would have showed you recognized a problem and went to the available resources (teacher), since you weren't able to rectify (contain the group dynamic) on your own. Teacher probably would have forced them to participate with threat of failing. Or just have you continue on your own.\n\nWhen things like this happen (group projects gone south), I always view it as a leadership issue. If you can manage to get everyone together, you're a good leader. If it all falls apart, either it was poor leadership, or a mess to begin with.\n\nThis happened to me in college. One girl was simply not pulling her weight, I went to the professor and explained. I tried to talk with her, even gave her small items to work on to include her. Ultimately, the professor removed her from the group and I think she just got a zero for her part. I was a good leader for those who stayed, but not good enough to convince the other one to pull her weight.\n\nYour partners were simply lazy and expected you to do all the work.", "NTA- They deserved it", "NTA  Your partners are major AH. They did NOTHING", "NTA \nFolks that don't work shouldn't get any credit, period. Its important to acknowledge your own value.", "I just want to say, through a nose of water that just shot out from laughing so hard, that you're NTA. They did you dirty and you cleaned plate. They had no credit cuz they did nothing. Simple.", "NTA. Group projects in school are always garbage and I believe should be outlawed. They don't serve a purpose except to have one person in the group do an entire project by themselves", "NTA. This also happened to me in high school (about 100 years ago!). I had a partner for a project, who did nothing. I planned the project, gave him his share to work on, and, like I said, he didn't do a single thing. On the day the project was due, I turned in my share and explained to the teacher that half the project was missing due to the other guy's lack of effort. She was going to fail both of us because \"it was a group project\". I talked her into giving me a A for my portion but she felt like she also had to give the slacker (who was a star football player) an A as well. \n\nThe jock was a good-looking football player who was used to having girls do all of his homework and was surprised when I didn't do his share of the work. The teacher was a woman who told me that I didn't understand the pressure she was under not to give the jock a failing grade. Sheesh.\n\nEnd of the story: jock went on to a semi-successful NFL career but now is suffering from possible CTE. It's not karma or anything, just a sad ending.", "NTA. It's the classic story of the hen making bread -- if you didn't help, then you don't get any of the bread. Why the fuck did they feel like they deserved part of that grade?", "lol same thing happened to my in 9th grade. I ended up doing a solid 85% of the work, one person helped me for like ten minutes. 15% person gave five of his percent to someone else, the other got zero. NTA. Group projects are designed to show this. I\u2019m guessing your teacher assigned you this specific group on purpose.", "They got another chance tho, so they technically didn\u2019t even fail", "Remember to type 'NTA' so your vote gets counted", "My bad, cheers for that", "NTA, and it sounds like they haven't even failed, they just don't get credit for your work and now actually have to do the project. If they fail at this point it is completely on them for not doing the work they were told to redo.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou tried to get them to help with the project multiple times and they didn't. Those kids need to develop your level of maturity and responsibility and they need to do it fast. They'll be adults and likely on their own in just a few short years. If they expect others to carry them through life and do everything for them they are going to be in for one hell of a rude awakening.", "They weren't your partners.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t fail them. They did that to themselves.", "NTA they did nothing, they get nothing", "I think you are brilliant. Well done!", "NTA.  They failed themselves by doing nothing.  Heck, they even got a totally undeserved second chance.  Let\u2019s see how many of those they get in the real world after school is over and they have to get jobs.", "You taught them a valuable life lesson!!\n\nNTA", "NTA. I have been where you are, stuck doing an entire project myself because my 'partners' were lazy wastes of oxygen who didn't care if their grades tanked and knew I cared enough about my own grade to carry their ungrateful rear ends. The only reason I didn't do exactly what you did is because my teacher refused to grade us on our individual contributions to the project.", "You were an AH in some of the ways that you communicated, but they didn't do any work, so they don't get credit for the project. Next time, I would suggest making a task list, asking how people want to divide the work, and going from there. If they flake, they can fail. Also, thank your friend for letting you vent and giving you a heads up on where everyone was. Apologize for hanging up on them in frustration. They didn't deserve that.\n\nGood job on making sure the project got over the finish line. Life will be full of people who want to coast on your efforts. Sometimes, we have to accept that, like with a boss. This is not one of those times. \n\nNTA.", "ESH. \n\nThey were lazy and insulting. You were hard-working and insulting. Instead of telling them to pull their weight for once, you could have said \"Hey, I put together a plan for the project, does this work for everyone? We still need to do the following: X, Y, Z, 1, etc. Can folks say what they can do and take responsibility for getting it done by W date, so that I can put it all together into a video?\"\n\nIf their response was inadequate, you try one more ti.e a coupke days later. \"We still need to do some work to finish the project. If I don't hear from you by Friday, I will assume that means you are doing your own project, and I will do your part, but you won't be listed in the credits as having worked on the project, so you probably will not get credit.\"\n\nI know you prob got mad, but being adversarial and demanding rarely persuades people. And life is much easier if you can be persuasive on demand.", "NTA I've done this before and the teacher gave you an A. It is exhausting when you, as a good student, get grouped with bad students because the teacher thinks you will be able to make them do work or have an ounce of discipline. It's not your job. Now they can redo the work themselves without a smart kid to do it all for them.", "NTA. I had a scenario like this in middle school. Group projects suck and I can confirm as an adult, most people still suck at them.", "What teachers think you learn in a group project\n\n* Break complex tasks into parts and steps.\r\n* Plan and manage time.\r\n* Refine understanding through discussion and explanation.\r\n* Give and receive feedback on performance.\r\n* Challenge assumptions.\r\n* Develop stronger communication skills.\n\nwhat you actually learn\n\n* How to work on your own\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI was the \"responsible one\" in high school, and reading your post made me flinch. If you don't want to lay the blame on your lazy project partners, then put it on the teacher who paired you with them and apparently expected you to do the work without complaining so no one else would have to deal with the fallout. \n\nSome people say these situations prepare you for working in the adult world, but that's probably part of why I'm a self-employed writer.", "Nta, group projects suck for this very reason.", "NTA You asked them repeatedly to participate but they never showed up. Of course you take credit for your own work. Of course you should not let them take credit for being a part of the project when they were not.\n\nThey are jerks and your teacher is a little bit, too, for giving them a second chance. They had the same chance as the rest of the class and did not take it. They should fail.", "NTA, and boy I wish I\u2019d had your guts in college. I HATED (and still do) group projects because it always fell on me and the one friend I\u2019d have in the group. And yet, we would cover for the lazy ones. Every.single.time. \n\nTeacher caught on eventually as he could tell the difference in writing styles, and the fact they would have 0 clue on what they were actually presenting. Friend and I always scored way higher.\n\nAnd the fact your teacher is making them do it over isn\u2019t \u201cfailing\u201d then. They still have a shot, albeit a small one.

I hated the fact that everyone in our group got the same grade and did nothing. \n\nI had a teacher realize this in one class and started failing the slackers in my group. 50% vs our 100%.

Your three group project mates have no right to tell you that you are TA and it is on them now.

I wonder what's going on?\". The fact they didn't is ALL ON THEM.", "So it was OP's job to hold their hand throughout a project that was assigned to all of them? Do you think they were somehow unaware of what was expected of them? If OP had gone to the teacher, I'm sure they would have accused her of being a snitch.", "So I agree that in the long run, OP will benefit from learning to be less adversarial for the sake of persuading people. However, I don't think he's an AH here at all. Sounds like these three clowns have a history of being lazy, and at the end of the day, OP has no incentive to persuade them to help in this case.", "Let's be honest, they're not mad they failed, they're mad they got laughed at.", "Exactly. The only way these three would have not gotten mad at OP would be if he had just done all the work and included them in the credits, which is an unacceptable solution. Going to the teacher early on, as you said, would have just resulted in them getting mad at OP for snitching."]}
