I have *very little sympathy* for people who try the \"grandparents rights\" line except in a few highly limited circumstances, basically where the grandparents were acting in some way as parents or at least significant caregivers.\n\nHowever, I think you're mistaken by framing the heart attack as lying. Your parents are entitled to medical privacy, same as the rest of us. They are allowed to decide who knows about their health issues, same as the rest of us. You have no right to know that your father had a heart attack, so it isn't lying to decline to tell you. Lying by omission would be if they didn't tell you that *your son* had had a serious injury. You have a right to *that* information.\n\nAging parents often keep information like this from their adult children.

That we are temporarily staying in an extended stay hotel until we close on our new house.

I\u2019m all for a right for privacy but they took away my right to decide what was and wasn\u2019t safe for MY child. That is where my problem lies. In fact they admitted I was the only one they didn\u2019t tell bc they 1. Said I caused the heart attack by putting boundaries on them not being allowed to poison my child and 2. Said I wouldn\u2019t let him drive my children to their house meaning they wouldn\u2019t get to see them as often. When I pointed out he could have had a heart attack while driving my children which could have led to their death\u2026they told me I was overreacting and hung up on me.", "And if they have it on writing that they deliberately were, essentially, poisoning the grandchild that will go far in court.", "Also, it generally only happens when one of the parents dies, not when both parents are alive", "To my knowledge, there is not a single state that will grant court-ordered visitation for grandparents if the child\u2019s parents are both alive and have custody.", "You might want to edit your post to clear up the pronoun issue.

I am not a lawyer. And I cannot speak to the law, therefore, when legal action is threatened, all communication has to go through a lawyer.\n\nThe moment your parents told you that they would sue for grandparents rights what is the moment that you should have cut them off and found a lawyer.\n\nI understand that you have been conditioned by their abusive upbringing to give into them in order to keep their favor and not spark their tantrums. But I am telling you that the behavior you learned as a child when you were trapped in their environs is not the same behavior you should be practicing as a parent of children that you have taken on the duty of protecting. \n\nWhen you move, you should talk to a lawyer about setting up an LLC and purchasing the home in the name of that LLC rather than under yours or your husband's names. It will keep your parents from finding you. They should never have contact with your children again.", "That works, \n\nIs there any chance they peruse the real-estate listings or that someone they know does that often? One option is to call several real-estate agents and find out if they can sell it before placing it on the open market.

According to the laws of our state, technically the parents of her elder child's father have the right to take her to court for GPR. They have never done so.\n\nThe woman who did take her to court for GPR was her narcissistic mother.

Can you imagine, even if GPR were justified, a judge declaring that the parents cannot celebrate Christmas with their own children, and that the grandmother gets it instead?\n\nThis went on for over two years, and it cost my friend $40,000 in legal fees to get it stopped.\n\nSo unless the laws of your state specifically say that contact with relatives is at the sole discretion of the parents, don't rely on your interpretation of the law. Because you will not be  writing the order.", "Yes, or if one parent loses custody completely and that side\u2019s grandparents still want to be involved.
