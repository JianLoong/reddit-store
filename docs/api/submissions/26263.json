I recommend seeing a therapist if you can, it\u2019s really helpful to process it all because it sucks, and it\u2019s heavy while you\u2019re in it.", "Me too but I might have to change plans now", "They will never have unsupervised access again. I have put a full stop to that. My father informed me that he will never do supervised visits so I sucked it up and did what Reddit said (I kid you not I did)\u2026then you won\u2019t see them again. Any phone calls\u2026any video chats\u2026any mail. Will all be supervised. Including any gifts that come in the mail for them. All will be opened and read/combed through ahead of time. (My mom likes to send cards and gifts when they are in trouble. \u201cWe love you no matter what anyone says. It breaks our hearts that you are away from us.\u201d Then she sends a gift that is all girly for the little who is girly\u2026and a super girly gift for the oldest who is a Tom boy. She does Rubik\u2019s cubes, ninja warrior stuff within her ability, mountain biking\u2026and my mom sends her oragami flowers, adult coloring books with girly themes like lipstick and make up.) Everything will be monitored from here on out.", "This is a valid thought. One that I will put a lot of effort into. Thanks. It\u2019s hard to know the best way to do things when you\u2019re \u201calways wrong.\u201d The ten month wait would have been retaliatory though. I fully admit that one lol.", "It\u2019s a learning process. I will be starting therapy once we move. I have to learn that boundaries aren\u2019t me manipulating them and controlling them. It\u2019s something normal people in healthy relationships don\u2019t need bc\u2026common sense prevails. Until I really learn that and take it to heart I continue to struggle with if I\u2019m right or wrong.", "This is where I stumble yes. They have the power bc I let them. Thanks", "It is on the list of things to do once we move.", "I wish you the best of luck", "Thanks"]}
