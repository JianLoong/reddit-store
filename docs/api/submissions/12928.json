If she said it in front of the person who made the food, THAT would be disrespectful but she did NOT, and it categorically is NOT racist.", "when the smell of something completely turns you off, the last thing you want to do is taste it. as i mentioned in my original comment, i used to feel the same way and i can tell you i would not have been willing to take even one bite at that time. if that somehow makes me racist, i guess i need to let the 4 or 5 indian friends i had at the time know that i must have been mistaken, thinking that i liked them and had respect for them. since i wasn't willing to eat the food, i obviously despised & looked down on them and their culture.\n\noh an that reminds me. i refused to try haggis while in scotland. how on earth did my scottish friend of 18 years not kick me out of her home for disrespecting her people & culture.\n\ni also hate irish dishes like corned beef and black & white pudding. now considering i'm 100% irish that does present a conundrum. i guess my family needs to write me off.", "Exactly! She could have just said no and moved on.\n\nWhat was the need to call it disgusting?", "\"American\" is a country but \"Indian\" is a race? There are like 84 ethnicities in India, you are the racist one here", "She called that dish disgusting.  Some people don't like certain flavors or smells.  I knew a Korean kid who didn't like pizza.  Did that make him racist? Of course not.  \n\nI think tripe smells disgusting, that doesn't mean I hate Mexicans, just one variety of taco.", "It's not racist to not like a certain smell. Especially  when that smell is a specific spice or something  they don't like. I hate the smell and taste of curry. That doesn't mean I hate people who cook with and smell like curry. It means I hate the smell and taste of curry, specifically. I also hate the smell of weed, coffee, many types of alcohol and cigarettes.

She's just saying she dislikes the smell of the food, that's all? It's perfectly reasonable and normal.

Let's not pretend this is some kind of neutral \"no thanks.\" This is a really strong rejection.", "I think you might be a little naive to believe that it couldn't at all be tied with a little racism. It may not be how she means it, but the spices used in Indian food are very strong. People smell like them as well. Saying it's disgusting is racist to some degree. I don't think she was trying to be racist though, probably just insecure about her partner eating someone else's food.", "If she thinks our food smells disgusting, well we usually smell like it, and so do our homes.
