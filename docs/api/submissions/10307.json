I bring the money in and she sends it out to where it needs to go. She set up automatic payments for all the bills that would allow it, credit cards, utilities, cable, cell phones, etc. \n\nOur property tax bill is split in half by the town. Part is due in July and part is due in December. (Please don't ask me how much it is. It's irrelevant.) I naturally assumed that it was set up for automatic payments, especially since my wife didn't say anything back in July.\n\nA few days ago, I got a notice from the town informing me that our tax bill had not been paid in December...or in July. My wife is currently in the hospital and I didn't think it would be a smart idea to start grilling her about it. So I decided to handle it on my own.\n\nI have no savings account. I have a line of credit against my house, but there isn't enough available to cover the entire tax bill. So I went online and looked at all of our credit cards. We each had one card with enough to cover part of the bill. So I put July on mine and December on hers.\n\nA few hours later, I got a \"WTF\" text from her with a copy of the notification from the credit card company. I explained to her that I had  thought she set up the automatic payments, but obviously I was mistaken. I told her that my plan was to pay down part of it on each card once I got my tax refund. She told me in no uncertain terms that she wanted ***her*** bill paid off completely.\n\nI want this to be crystal clear. I did not use her card out of spite or any reason other than there was enough available credit to cover part of it. If I could have put both on my card, I would've done so. We are authorized users on each other's cards, so I have access to her accounts, and she has access to my accounts.\n\nI did have one other option, but I would not have been able to get the funds in time. It involves a financial advisor and courts and I just wanted to get it paid off. I plan to follow through with that option at some point this year and pay off whatever I can.\n\nAnd please don't get on me about not having a savings account. That's not what this post is about. I've never had one. Until this point, I've always had a contingency plan as far as covering bills, emergencies, etc. \n\nSo, in the matter of using my wife's credit card, AITA?", "created_utc": 1676742608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115kwte/aita_for_using_my_wifes_credit_card_to_pay_part/", "score": 193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
