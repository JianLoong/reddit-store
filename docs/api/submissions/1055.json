I also said I would take the kids with me so they weren't underfoot while everyone unpacked. Two are mine. Two are my sister's and one is my brother's.\n\nWhile at the store I said each kid could have a discretionary budget of $10 for snack food. Keep in mind that that's $50 altogether.\n\nOne of my sister's kids wanted a box of gushers and two of the tins of blue diamond almonds. That's $13 altogether. I suggested she put back the tins and get a bag of the store brand instead, which is actually more almonds, weight wise, and would put her at right around that $10 mark. She said she didn't want to, because she wanted those flavors. I suggested she put back the gushers and get a cheaper candy then. She started to cry, so I said I was sorry, but she needed to decide what she wanted most, because she can't have everything.\n\nShe got two bags of gummies instead of the gushers and she was put out, but the situation was resolved. Then she saw what my kids got. They both got store brand stuff, so they had a ton. They got multiple of the 98\u00a2 bags of great value candy, a huge bag of chips each and a bunch of those girl scout knockoff cookies. They were both at $10.\n\nMy niece started crying, asking why they got more. When her sister realized my kids got more than her too, she also started crying. I explained that some brands are less expensive, and said we could pick out other snacks for them so they could also get more, but they wanted the snacks they had, just in equal quantities to what my kids got. Then my nephew joined in and said he also wanted more. At that point I was exhausted, so I just took the kids to checkout and bought everything and we left.\n\nWhen we got back I started putting groceries away. My nieces ran to their mom and complained about all the snacks my kids got. Instead of telling them to be appreciative that I took them to get stuff they wanted, my sister came over and asked why I wouldn't get her kids what they wanted. I explained that if I raised their price ceiling to $15 I'd have to for the other three, and then I'd be paying $75 for junk in addition to the $200 for regular groceries.\n\nMy sister rolled her eyes and called me a miser. I was really mad, because I just spent $250 on food for our whole family and don't even get a thank you? My husband said it's not worth being upset about, but I am upset. My brother said I wasn't wrong to want to treat the kids equally, but if I let my niece buy her initial choices, no one would have realized she went over and the whole situation would have been avoided.\n\nSo was I TA?", "created_utc": 1667513589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylg9hb/aita_for_making_my_nieces_stick_to_a_budget/", "score": 396, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was always mega fun for me and my siblings after we got selection boxes at Christmas. We always traded one bar for one bar. My sister hates caramel. So I would always take all her caramel chocolate bars, and in return, I'd agree to swap them with chocolate bars that she liked and I didn't. Except there were more bars that she disliked than I disliked. So I would often end up swapping away bars that I liked too, sometimes slightly more than the caramel ones. And to make this up to me, she'd always swap me her crunchie, because I LOVED crunchie. She liked it too, but she hated caramel more than she liked crunchie, lol. \n\nHer favourite was the Wispa, which I woukd readily trade to her because I didn't like it. Or at least I thought I didn't. After several years, I realised I no longer had any memory of what a Wispa tasted like, because I always traded every Wispa I got with my sister. I tried one again after I became an adult, and they're actually quite nice? No regrets though, lol.\n\nEdit: I have no idea what skills this taught me. Except, I guess I'm always very willing to trade shifts with people at work unless I genuinely can't trade? So I guess what I learnt from my childhood is, good trading relations are very invaluable and can occasionally lead to crunchie-level experiences, so you should always play nice and keep trading routes open, even if it means that sometimes you have to eat some mediocre caramel when you didn't particularly want to.", "NTA although I did opposite with my niece.
