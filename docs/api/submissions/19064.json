Part of that discussion was how so many parents do their children disservice by feeding them so much garbage and processed food, high sugar, etc. We agreed that even though we don't want kids, if we had one it wouldn't be until the age of like 6 or 7 that we introduce high-sugar foods on a limited basis. \n\n\n\nYesterday, I visited my sister and 2 Y.O. niece.

That's honestly a gross perspective. First she accuses you of not caring about your niece because you did something *totally normal and harmless* and got her some icecream at a parent's request. Second, what is this \"strong man\" crap? You being a man has nothing to do with the situation. Third, not your kid, not your business if your sister is okay with her having sugar.\n\nAlso, just gonna throw out that your guys' ideas around sugar seem to be rather militant. And that can be just as harmful to a child and their relationship with food as being overly permissive with the amount of sugar they're allowed to consume.\n\nBut for getting your niece some icecream? NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your business what your sister allows her kids to have-within reason. Heroin? No. Ice cream on occasion? Absolutely. Your GF needs to have several seats and let an otherwise good mother parent however she sees fit. \n\nYou all are free to have hypothetical scenarios but I assure you, they are hypothetical. Things change when you actually have tiny humans living with and depending on you.", "Your response to a song about body images and EDs is to shame kids eating habits? You\u2019re NTA for the ice cream trip, but you and your gf definitely are for that. Teaching kids to have a healthy relationship with food is important, and you don\u2019t accomplish that by being restrictive and banning things.", "Info: don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a MASSIVE overstep and red flag that your GF thinks she has the right to involve herself in your relationship with your family and insist on questioning your sister\u2019s parenting? Why did you apologise for not doing anything wrong for - shock, horror - getting your own niece an ice cream?!", "NTA your gf is really annoying. She's being judgmental and giving unsolicited parenting advice  which is bad enough but even worse from non-parents.  Also, she's doesn't know what she's talking about if she thinks a smoothie is a low-sugar alternative to ice cream. She's going to be an insufferable parent with an unhealthy attitude about food.", "NTA. It's not yours and your gf's role to police your sister's parenting.\n\nAlso, having been the parent of small kids, I can tell you first-hand how sad it is to watch a 4yo at a birthday party who isn't allowed to eat the cake, but must make do with the *delicious, healthy* organic carrot sticks from mommy's handbag. Those are the kids who will make themselves sick on party food as soon as they're unsupervised, because their parents make such a big f-ing deal about every single thing they eat and they've never had a moment to just eat what all the other kids are eating.", "you and your gf are both assholes. While I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t force your beliefs on your sister and her niece, this kind of mindset is how kids get eating disorders later. \n\nThat being said NTA in this particular instance since you at least know to stay in your lane when it comes to other children unlike your gf apparently.", "NTA\n\nYou and your gf can parent your own children if and when it's time to do that. Your sister asked you to take your niece out for a treat (and to presumably give her a break), and you did what she asked. She's the parent here.\n\nYour girlfriend needs to stay in her lane.", "NTA. Not being a mother, your girlfriend doesn't really understand what it's like to have someone give you unsolicited parenting advice. Especially the type that sounds like you're finding fault with their methods (in a situation where there isn't actual abuse). I think you're right not to make a comment about ice cream in a one-off situation that resulted in some good bonding time with your niece.", "NTA. It's way more damaging to children to foist adult issues with food onto them.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with kids enjoying sweets every now and again as long as it's not in excess and they have a relatively healthy diet.\n\nThere is also nothing wrong with an Uncle spoiling his niece and helping his sister out on a bad day. Probably brightened her day a lot to see you doting on her kiddo too.", ">and made an alternative suggestion like going to get a smoothie\n\nThis right here just proves you two don't really know what you're talking about and should probably stop judging people for innocuous activities such as going for ice cream.\n\nUnless you're giving your 2yr old niece a green smoothie that you made yourself, smoothies have just as much if not more sugar in them than ice cream does.  In fact most smoothies are made from ice cream! Or if you're going with a fruit smoothie, that's all just condensed fruit juice that's far too much sugar if you're as concerned about sugar as you two say you are.\n\nIt's one thing to treat someone with an ice cream, it's another to revolve an entire diet around sugar foods, or more importantly food that is converted to surgar like any wheat product. Bread for example converts into sugar in your body, and store bought bread as a ton of sugar added, are you concerned about removing bread from your 2yr old nieces diet too?", "There's nothing wrong with ice cream now and then as a treat. A healthy attitude towards food includes understanding that treats now and then are fine.\n\nSame goes with soda. Don't drink it as a daily beverage. It's fine to have pizza and soda when you're at someone's birthday party.\n\nNTA", "NTA - You didn't override the parent's decision based on your own opinions. Also not the AH for keeping your opinion to yourself. Nobody wants to hear your unasked-for opinion. No parent wants to hear your unasked-for opinion about their parenting, and this goes double if you're a non-parent. You did the right thing keeping it to yourself. GF needs to keep her nose out of your family dynamic. \n\nAlso, if girlfriend is suggesting \"get a smoothie instead\", she's pretty fucking clueless - smoothies are chock-full of sugar.", "NTA\n\nIf you tried to backseat parent,  you would have been the asshole.   Your sister's daughter means your sister's rules apply,  not yours and certainly not your girlfriends.", "NTA. For taking for an ice cream.\n\nGF is as are for even thinking of suggesting alternatives.\n\nYOU ARE NOT THE PARENTS. If there is no abuse, no one gets to make choices for other kids.\n\nSugar now and again isn't unhealthy. Now, on that, you do realize that even fruits and certain ones have high sugar content that can be what you would think aa unhealthy.\n\nSo a smoothy can be just as unhealthy. Also, more so depends on what is put in it. \n\nHow you guys would parent is your choice but by even a basic suggestion for alternatives you are telling and suggesting to a parent that they are unhealthy and being bad parents by their choice. That you think they are bad parents enough that you have to try and get them to change their lifestyle to what you want. \n\nSee it from the other side. YOUR GF got so upset you did this. To a kid who isn't HERS.  If it was your kid and it was suggested to get them an ice cream, how much more would she fly off the handle. How much would she feel disrespected or judged for her choices. But she wants you to do the same.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t let your GF spend any time with your niece. She will ensure she grows up to have an eating disorder.", "NTA. Your girlfriend\u2019s views on food, and female bodies/strong male role models are just as likely to cause disordered eating in children as taking a child out for occasional ice cream. A healthy relationship with food recognizes that nothing is banned. Fueling the body most important. But an occasional treat is perfectly acceptable.", "NTA-You\u2019re right about not interfering in her parenting.", "NTA, but your GF needs to stay the hell in her lane and if she needs to see you being a \u201cstrong man\u201d about things am she can see you tell her to back off your sister. \n\nDon\u2019t even mention it once to your sister, you already know she feeds her children responsibly. \n\nYour GF and your idea to not feed your future children sugar until they are 6-7 is hypothetical and likely won\u2019t happen. Regardless is is not your place or hers to judge how other people decide to feed their children.", "NTA.\n\n1) Everyone's a perfect parent until they actually have to be a parent. Your GF can have any ideals she likes about parenting now, but a lot will change if you do actually have a child\n\n2) There's growing evidence that shows not placing super strict limits on sugar after the age of 2 helps children learn self-control and moderation. If it's completely restricted, they'll be more likely to binge on it when they do have access to it. There's no such thing as 'good' food and 'bad' food - it's neutral.\n\n3) Your niece is not your child so you, and certainly your girlfriend, don't get to dictate how your niece is raised. You're right it would've been seriously passive aggressive to make a comment to your sister.\n\n4) Taking a toddler for ice cream is such a lovely activity. Your GF sounds seriously uptight and miserable.", "NTA. Your gf sounds insufferable.", "Side note if you want to be a strong male figure and encourage body issues, the wrong way to do that is to restrict sugar.  The amount of research out there about how restriction causes much higher levels of eating disorders and body dysmorphia is endless.  Much better for a 2 year old to have a scoop of ice cream than watch her uncle challenge her mom on how that may not be good for her.", "You and your GF are judgy assholes. You don't have kids, you don't comment on other's choices for their kids, not even one time. Never, ever do that to your sister. \n\nThank you for not procreating.", "NTA, she missed the whole point of that Victoria secret song. She's also not that kids mum and needs to butt out and stay in her lane.", "NTA for taking your niece for ice cream, but YTA for judging other parents for what they feed their kids during your dinner conversation.   I have a child and if I overheard two childless adults talking about how they won\u2019t feed their hypothetical child foods with sugar until they are 6 or 7, I\u2019d roll my eyes.", "NTA sounds like you and your gf need to have a long talk about how you would want to raise kids in the future.   First of all 2 is not a baby.  Second as you said, assuming this isn\u2019t an \u2018app she eats is junk food situation then there\u2019s nothing wrong with this 2 year old going out for ice cream occasionally.", "NTA you are right that your sister is her parent and if she says it\u2019s okay to get icecream than that\u2019s okay. Your gf is the ah . A 2 y.o isn\u2019t going to die from some icecream once in a while. That\u2019s honestly how people end up with ED.", "Your gf isn't a parent and admittedly doesn't want to be one. \n\nShe should keep her damned parenting advice to herself.", "NTA\n\nBut hey, have you got any idea how much sugar is in mothers milk? Or formula for that matter. \nOr fruit, or carrots, or corn?\n\nI agree that you don't want your children to eat lots of highly processed sugary foods. There is however no way that you are going to avoid all high sugar foods.\nDo you plan on being cookies with your kid and then have them taste of ash? \n\nPutting that much emphasis on not eating a certain thing is also likely to lead to eating disorders.\n\nSidenote: \nThere are 7 different types of sugar. \nFructose: found in fruits and honey.\nGalactose: found in milk and dairy products.\nGlucose: found in honey, fruits and vegetables.\nLactose: found in milk, made from glucose and galactose.\nMaltose: found in barley.\nSucrose: made up of glucose and fructose and found in plants.\nXylose: found in wood or straw.", "You are what Jax is singing about you absolute asshole. Food is ok in moderation and by placing moral values on food and restricting food you are setting up issues with food. YTA for even thinking about placing such a negative relationship with food on someone else. Please listen to that song again. I mean really listen.", "NTA.  True, high amounts of sugar are bad for you.  Consider this;  the Apple Kiwi Bunga smoothie (designed for kids)  at Smoothie King has 35 grams of sugar, in comparison 6 ounces of vanilla ice cream has 36 grams of sugar.  Albeit with the smoothie you are getting the majority of the sugar from fruit, while with the ice cream you are getting sugar from milk as well as granulated sugar.  Your body will thank you for the nutrients in the fruit and the milk, but sugar is sugar whatever the form.", "Geez if I were you I'd think twice about having a baby with that control-freak.   Next time tell her to keep her parenting tips to herself, and not control how you interact with your niece, since it's NEITHER of your jobs to parent your niece.   NTA.", "NTA -\n\nThis whole post made me chuckle.\n\nSo two young adults, who don't want to have kids, had a discussion about their opinions on sugar intake of children.\n\n Then they arbitrarily decided that age 6-7 but limited, (I can't forget limited, do they agree on what's \"limited\") was the proper thing to do as parents.  \n\nThen OP does his sister a favor by doing what she asks him to do with her child.  OP's gf when decides that OP is a liar because he didn't try to enforce a standard that they basically pulled out of thin air during a discussion a few days ago on his sister (who you know, actually is raising a child who seems to have a pretty good diet for 2 where you'll beg the child to lick a chicken tender), even though they don't want children where they themselves would actually have to enforce this standard?  \n\nYou both seem like you would be absolute awesome people to be friends with.  We don't have children, we don't want children, we make arbitrary standards for said imaginary children based on a conversation on a date brought on by a song on the radio.  We're not experts in children, children nutrition or anything like that, but we know better.\n\nAnd the gf takes it one step further by wanting OP to enforce this new made up standard on his family.\n\nWow.", "NTA - sorta. Your attitude about sugar, especially not as a parent, is wild. Yes. Too much sugar consumption is bad, period, and it's not good to get kids addicted to sugar at a young age. That said, ice cream as an occasional treat is more than okay.\n\nAlso this made me laugh:\n\n>...an alternative suggestion like going to get a smoothie or something.\n\nDo you have any idea how much sugar is in a lot of smoothies? To illustrate, I compared a basic mango smoothie at Jamba Juice with a scoop of chocolate chip ice cream at Baskin Robbins. The smoothie has 63 grams of sugar compared with 11 grams in the ice cream!", "NTA\n\nYou parented the kid as you were asked to do so.\n\nPeople saying YTA for your eating ideology I think need to read what was said again. Junk / fast foods can lead to addiction and as a parent you have a responsibility to your children to take care of their health. That includes ensuring they don't become overweight / obese. \n\nIs your ideology a bit extreme? Possibly, but I don't think it warrants a YTA. I would suggest rather than focusing on high sugar foods especially, focus on a balanced diet and not over-eating.\n\nYour partner definitely TA. You do not enforce parenting ideology on other peoples kids unless they are in serious danger.", "NTA for taking her for icecream.\nNot giving young children a tonn of sugar is a good idea, but no sugar at all is not realistic at all.

That's how body positivity works, right? \n\nNTA for the ice cream but you and your gf's perspectives are incredibly flawed. \n\nPS every person has a \"I'll never let my kids XYZ\" and then they actually have kids.

I would love a snack, but Uncle can\u2019t really have alot of sugar, can we go get some frozen yogurt instead? If the 2 year old agrees mom will too and you aren\u2019t insulting her parenting choices.

Because their parents never taught them that self-control or restraint regarding healthy eating habits, they just removed that stuff from the equation... which only actually works when the kid is young enough to be watched like a hawk 24/7. \n\nMy parents rarely bought us junk/sugary foods and were super careful to restrict our access to what they did get for us. When I was a kid, my best friend's parents wouldn't let her have *any* sugar or junk foods. The result? At school or summer camp, we'd spend all the money our parents gave us for lunch/water from the vending machine on junk food and soda.

Sounds like there's a pretty strong NTA response. I wanted to make sure there wasn't something I was missing. I was very simply trying to make sure that my action of taking my niece for ice cream did not fly in the face of the one aspect of the earlier convo I had with my gf; I was sure that what I did was a normal, expected behavior regardless of what my feelings were or weren't about what my sister was asking.\n\nAs I expected, there were comments outside of what I was asking, but related to the situation that I'd like to address...\n\n\n\n-We won't have kids, even if we do stay together. Our conversation sparked by the radio was much longer and more broad than simply arriving at a conclusion that hypothetical children of ours would have a limited sugar intake. The definition of \"limited\" was not spelled out nor did it need to be since the situation will not exist. That definitely would have been hashed out, and I absolutely would have brought the mental health/relationship with food issue to the table for that (i.e. moderation creating a more well-adjusted kid who isn't afraid of a few calories and is less likely to hide what they are eating from their parents, less likely to binge and crash and/or develop an ED later (or earlier) in life.\n\n\n\n-My gf is from another country and she grew up eating practically 100% whole foods. Little to no \"factory foods,\" so to speak. She has worked as a nanny here and it was part of her job to feed the kid what the parents asked, even though she didn't agree with those choices. She cares deeply about the kid and it hurt her to watch her parents give her so much junk food and very little fresh \"real\" foods. She watched the child become overweight and unhealthy as a result, so I guess she has some sensitivity to children consuming junk food that I wasn't aware of.  I'm chalking up her insistence on making a suggestion to my sister to a partial lack of cultural awareness - especially with respect to the judgment parents get no matter what decisions they make. I don't think she realizes that the US cultural norm is (or should be) not to give unsolicited advice unless the child is obviously being neglected or abused (and yes, this could mean if they were literally living on a diet of ice cream, which my niece, as I said, most certainly is not). I did not disclose that she is from another country at first because I didn't want any bias in responses. \n\n\n\n-Some of you made some strong statements about us without having all of the information. I can assure you, beyond leading a significantly healthier lifestyle than 99% of people, we are kind, caring people who get along with practically everyone we meet. We hang out with friends (virtually none of whom share in our lifestyle), go out to eat once or twice a week, and have *a beer or two* and dessert (\ud83d\ude31) when we do. But we're at the gym every day, cook fresh meals, work our asses off, take care of our mental health, etc. \n\n-Her response to this situation took me completely off guard and caused one of the worst fights we've had. I don't know if the mental story she created about my behavior just struck a particular nerve in that moment and she overreacted, but she's had some time to reflect and apologized to me today about the whole thing. We had a nice long hug when we got home and things are already better.\n\n\n\n-Final note: I read at least one comment saying that to make a suggestion to my sister would be passive-aggressive. I agree, and I told my gf as much, and that I'm not going to jeopardize my relationship with my sister by saying something I know could and would be taken as passive-aggressive. She does not agree or at least doesn't see how that could be passive-aggressive - maybe that's also a cultural nuance  since parenting is such a hot-button topic in the US; it's not like we're recommending a different brand of motor oil. I'm not going to come back at her with a \"reddit said so,\" but we agreed to ask our respective therapists about this, and if it ever comes up again I can tell her what was said. \n\nI do appreciate your comments, I don't usually crowd-source my relationship advice but she was *so* upset I had to get a reality check. Thanks, all!", "You lost me at posted some ig stories. Loser", "NTA. I once had an instructor who was a doctor. He told stories about nutrition and other things.

We never got to the \"what about birthday parties?\" discussion, or those other ones like it since it was a pure hypothetical. I would totally agree with you if I was of the mindset that I wouldn't actually care about how much sugar my imaginary kids had, but I do. \n\n\n\nLet me reframe my question and see if hearing it a different way changes your answer: does the conversation I had with my gf automatically confer upon me the responsibility to \"speak up\" to my sisters when I see them giving their kids sugary snacks? And/or does it automatically mean that I *should not* gave taken my niece for ice cream per her mother's request? I don't think it does.", "As a kid who hated salad and veggies too, I agree. My point was that my sisters are both very health-conscious people, and I know from talking with them that they don't want their daughters to struggle with weight and body image, including having bad relationships with food. They want them in sports, dance, etc - *something* active. Knowing this, as their older brother and uncle to their daughters, if I ever felt that they weren't pursuing those goals, I would have a convo with them. Not pushing my own ideals, but trying to be supportive because I know what they've expressed they want for their daughters. Another hypothetical I do not expect to become reality because my sisters are both strong capable women who I believe can put their daughters on the intended path without my help. But I'm here to support if needed.", "I'm not going to bring up the past with her, but as I may have mentioned, we both agreed to ask our therapists about this. I know for a fact that both of mine will say what most have said here which is \"stay the fuck out of other peoples' parenting decisions.\" Delivery doesn't matter, it's offering unsolicited advice, even if it's said nicely. Asking \"don't you think that's a lot of sugar for a toddler?\" Would be passive-aggressive. So I'll be prepared if the discussion ever rears its ugly head again, that two people who I trust said the same thing.", "No worries lol.", "We really didn't give ours that much because we pretty much stuck to my husband's (from Italy) diet. So from a very young age she was conversant with stinky European cheeses and fruit for dessert most nights.\n\n(Although her nonna, who was very strict with her own children, actually kept cookies in the bottom shelf of the living room hutch so the visiting grandchildren wouldn't have to bother an adult to get a treat.)\n\nI've always tried to follow the maxim, everything in moderation. And \"everything\" includes moderation itself, which sometimes you just have to let go of. So treat foods (not daily but as an actual treat) were a thing. \n\nThe main takeaway from never having American junk food in the house is that she doesn't like cola. Which as a red blooded American I just cannot fathom.", "They are parenting imaginary children and the first thing they think of is the control they are going to have over them. Nice!", "Responsibility to speak with you sister, no it\u2019s rude to question her parenting. Taking your niece even if you don\u2019t agree with the ice cream which you agreed she eats well on the regular so it\u2019s not a big deal is fine. Your girlfriend is the issue.", "Let me say this another way because your questions are nonsense. You did the right thing by taking your niece and you should not say a damn thing to your sister, not even once. The convos you had with your gf were in bad faith because you clearly give hypothetical conversations zero weight. Why even have a convo about imaginary kids and sugar if you don\u2019t care or won\u2019t care until the kids are real? You end up gassing your gf up on an opinion that is not even true for you (as you have admitted and contradicted several times). Your gf is batshit for thinking (hypothetical convo or not) that she or you get a say in the treat a mother gives her daughter. What I am calling out here is that in your post AND your comments you oscillate between caring and not caring. Your girlfriend is WRONG. I\u2019m glad she apologized and realizes it. But you seem to have no backbone here.", "My parents were like OP and I definitely went crazy on sugary treats any time I had a chance to eat some without my parents around. It took a long time for me to unlearn that behavior. I definitely still have a sweet tooth, but now I can have just one brownie or a couple pieces of chocolate and that's enough. I feed my kids a healthy diet overall, but they get regular treats in moderation. Nothing wrong with that.", "I think she may have realized she was in the wrong, as she has apologized to me today.", "The part of the convo about limiting sugar until 6-7 years old was so incredibly brief. It's not that I gave it no weight because it was a hypothetical. It was a passing note of a much broader conversation. If I had known it was going to dictate how I should handle situations with my nieces I would have had MUCH more to say. Again, though, I appreciate your honesty and can definitely see where you're coming from.", "im going to assume that bc of your ex-wife and that horrible experience (and i am deeply sorry for her and that you had to watch), that maybe your meter for what's normal is warped, so i mean this in a genuinely not-condescending way: your current gf's way of talking about food, especially food for kids, and the way she's handled this with your niece, are ALL also unbalanced ways of approaching food and food + kids. sugar is not great to have in excess. but the level of restriction and food policing she's engaging in for someone else's child is not healthy or normal. it's worth a few hard conversations about to see how flexible she's willing to be about this, bc \"ideal for hypothetical kids\" is one thing-- all parents start out with some rules they think they'll follow-- but \"pressuring caregivers of other children\" is another entirely and you don't want that pressure every time you care for your nieces.", "She's gorgeous, tall, and very fit. We were out on a date walking around, and this guy on a patio we were walking by goes, \"Holy shit that's a supermodel right there.\" I get the idea that she's probably gotten away with a lot because of her beauty, and maybe being with me is the first time she's been called out on things, I don't know. After getting divorced I made a commitment to myself that I'm not going to excuse or let slide poor behavior like I did with my ex. I did that to keep peace in the relationship, but it destroyed my own peace. I'm a reasonable person, and I think there's always room to agree to disagree in a relationship, but I'm not a mind reader - in this case, after discussing/agreeing on something in purely hypothetical terms it in no way should have been automatically expected that I would conduct myself a certain way in the context of my non-hypothetical family members.", "Thanks for your understanding. I think I'm at peace with what I experienced with my ex. It was hard, and it affected me, but that situation is behind me. What I learned from that is how dangerous it is to make treats off-limits. If the discussion ever comes around again, I will have to walk some of it back because I did lose sight of that experience in that moment. Would I be a parent that just mindlessly allows my kid to eat anything? No. But a *small* treat once in a while, perhaps a big treat on a rare occasion would be ok, I'd rather not create an eating disorder in my hypothetical child. I would model this too, as I limit my own sugar intake. Anyway, hoping this is dead and we don't have to worry about it.", "NTA Your GF needs to chill. Your niece isn\u2019t her kid and it\u2019s not her decision what the child eats. You did your sister a favor. And there is nothing wrong with a 2 year old having an occasional ice cream.  Your GF sounds like she has some food issues that wouldn\u2019t be healthy to force on a child. Forbidding a food group only makes it more enticing. She is being judgmental and has completely unrealistic views of kids and food", "Nta your girlfriend need to get over herself it your sister child therefore your sister choice on what the child does or doesnt eat end of conversation", "I completely concur with the top few comments (NTA).\n\nAnd I want to add that your perspective on where you have standing where you don't have standing to say something is absolutely on target. Your gf's perspective is not. You have an opinion; it's not completely in line with your sister's. But it's her kids and her decision. Your sister was asking you to help her get a bit of a break and for you to do something fun with your niece; she wasn't asking for your opinion on sugar. You got that. Don't let your gf nudge you away from your good approach.", "Is this a joke? What an insufferable post lol \n\nNTA for the ice cream but E S H for already patting yourselves on the back for parenting kids you don\u2019t even have yet, jeez Louise lol", "NTA and as a mom, I have to say, you did an amazing thing by not giving unsolicited advice on her choices.", "NTA\n\nHowever....just a head's up, your sugar plan is a bad idea. There have been a lot of parents on here who have had similar plans, and it typically ends up with the child having little too no control around junk food. You cannot monitor the food your kid is exposed to 24/7; if you restrict it too much at home, they'll go crazy with it when they do get access *or* they'll think it's a bad thing and start to extend that fear to other foods as well. A friend of mine has a 7 year old with an eating disorder because she went too extreme in banning all junk food and messed up the kid's relation with food. An occasional ice cream will *not* harm a two year old. In fact, it's laying early groundwork for her understanding of ice cream, as an occasional treat. \n\nWhen you do decide to have kids, you should run this plan by someone with actual knowledge of kids' dietary behaviors. I'm sure they can better instruct you about how and when to introduce sugar.", "So your GF thinks fat shaming a 2 year old is okay?  She wants you to tell your sister how to raise her own child?   If she wants a \"strong man\" tell her to mind her own business.", "You sound like one of those guys who is vegan when his girlfriend is vegan and then a hunter when his next girlfriend is into hunting. \n\nYou do not actually agree with your girlfriend's militant sugar stance or aggressive and judgey parenting style. It's pretty clear you believe that so long as a child gets a healthy and varied diet, an occasional treat is fine and a fun, memorable part of childhood.\n\nBut you went along with paying lip service to your girlfriend because 1) you want to appease her and 2) you never expected it to come up and bite you in real life.\n\nI can't see you guys being long term, unless you want to wind up one of those beaten down, ghost husbands whom no one ever really notices standing next to his forceful wife. \n\nPlease get better at actually speaking your real opinion (and knowing what that is in the first place) before starting the next relationship.\n\nESH except your sister and niece.\n\nETA: that smoothie your girlfriend suggested would likely have had way more sugar than a kiddie scoop of ice cream, even with sprinkles. And being overly restrictive of foods leads to disordered eating.", "Also, I think it's really weird to go from a song about how girls grow up with all these ideas about how they're supposed to look which lead to them restricting their eating and literally talks about developing eating disorders, to the couple talking about how they would be super strict and restrictive with their kids' diets. You know that if parents don't model healthy relationships with food, including the idea of 'junk food' moderation, that's actually more likely to cause the kids to have issues with food, right?", "She literally said in the same conversation, \"I want a man who has an opinion on things and stands by it!\" My reply was,\"Isn't that what I'm doing right now? I'm bringing my informed opinion that we shouldn't tell my sister what to do!\" Also, in another part of it, I said,\"a strong man values his family relationships and builds them up. You're pushing me to do something that will go in the opposite direction.\"\n\n\n\nNeither of those landed well in the moment, and she got super mad, but I think after sleeping on it, she (hopefully) realized I was being exactly the man she was describing that she wanted.", "Thank you, I appreciate the support and encouragement. I was relatively confident I approached this situation with a sense of poise and rationality.", "My sister was anti-sugar at first but my 2 year old niece had part of my sister's piece of my birthday cake the other day. She sees other people eating it & wants some.", "I know what people mean by 'sugar' (usually candy, ice cream, dessert stuff), but it's also such a funny perspective when fruit is literally so much sugar, along with the vitamins and other things.", "My husband didn't get a lot of sugary treats and when he did, they were rationed.  When I met him, I couldn't buy Oreos because he would eat the whole bag in one sitting.  He didn't know how to just take one or two because he had never been taught moderation.  As a matter of fact, because of the way his parents rationed food, he would practically swallow food whole!", "And apple juice has more sugar than most sodas.", "Or we'll be here in 16 years talking about their kids' eating disorder.", "Two more months!", "Holy shit, that's super fucking entitled of you. I'm astonished that you think it's your place to address your neices directly if you think they're gaining too much weight or aren't fit enough! And the fact that you'd do it under the guise of concern and care is gross. It's not your place, EVER, to comment on your neices' bodies, weight, food consumption, clothing, or any aspect of their appearance in a negative way. Stay in your lane! \n\nPraise them for things that have nothing to do with their appearance; encourage them to read, learn, and be educated; tell them to be proud of themselves. The more they can validate themselves internally, and not crave external validation, the more they'll strive for excellence in life. They don't need some man telling them how to look, or what shape/size is acceptable, and that bullshit paves the road to eating disorders. \n\nYou're both (OP and gf) TA.", "Hey, low sugars until 2 is totally reasonable and doable.  I didn't let my son have juice until he was 3 or so.  They don't know what anything really is - it is easy to keep it from them and they don't know they are missing out.  Once they really start communicating with other kids it's all over.", "NTA. Not your child, not your choice.

I am all for teaching children about treats in general - and by that I mean that you teach your child the difference between a treat and everyday food.", "Please do not have children with this woman. I have a feeling that her children will have eating disorders if she is shaming you for your sister's request of taking your niece out for ice cream. \n\nI'm assuming you didn't get her a monster cone. And it will probably be a nice memory for her. It would have been a nice memory for you if your girlfriend hadn't tainted it. NTA", "NTA but your gf is. It\u2019s none of her business what your sister chooses to feed her child and you are correct in handling it the way you are. The one thing parents loathe is being told how to raise their kids by people who don\u2019t have kids and don\u2019t plan on having kids. Sugar in moderation is fine and it\u2019s clear your sister cares about her kid\u2019s health if she\u2019s typically conscious about her diet. What you don\u2019t want to do is demonize any foods so much that it creates an unhealthy relationship with food. That kind of all or nothing attitude can be equally as harmful to a child as giving them a diet filled with processed foods and sugars.", "Your gf is an emotionally manipulative control freak. She can't see the good in your sisters parenting at all, what makes you think you could sustain a relationship with someone that self righteous and assumes bad faith in your sisters decisions. Imagine spinning taking a kid out for a TREAT into a forum on your sisters parenting and your role as an uncle, one where she provides all the definitions of love, care, neglect and manliness based on her values. \n\nShe sucks, if you stay with someone this ruthlessly self righteous prepare for yourself or potentially your parenting to be under attack like this anytime she feels she has the highground. \n\nYTA, she's The A.", "Actually I have three kids, and the eldest never tasted ice-cream till she was 7..didn't like the look of it. Then one day licked her cousins ice cream and that was it..", "You apologised to your gf for not meddling in your sister's parenting and judging her like she's neglectful over some icecream?\n\nYou sound ignorant as hell too, most kids can handle a rare treat of icecream because they don't have weight issues, as little kids most of them go through periods of growth and illness where it's all burned off, in fact it's good to have a little weight there for their non eating periods when they get sick. \n\nWhy you'd need to defend not judging and meddling is beyond me, she sounds exhausting and mean.", "Unless you make the smoothie yourself and are able to control what goes in it. Store bought? Forget it.", "Oh geez we tell my daughter she\u2019s gonna turn into a chicken nugget because of how much she eats chicken nuggets. We get the gluten free organics ones to make me feel a little better but she seriously wants chicken nuggets everyday for lunch. So that\u2019s what she get. She usually eats a healthy breakfast, snacks on fruit, and gets a healthy dinner. Two chicken nuggets for lunch won\u2019t kill her. \n\nOn a side note I listened to a really interesting podcast about our mindset and how it affects our weight and relationships with food. The woman who was interviewed had a Ph.d in neuroscience and specialized in relationships with food. She said that she totally lets her kids eat the junk and doesn\u2019t restrict them. She eats a very clean diet and she knows as they get older they\u2019ll be more apt to follow her example if she models the gold behavior rather than restricting them into eating well. \n\nI don\u2019t restrict my kids but like if they want 4 cookies I\u2019m gonna stop them and let them know they can one, maybe two, but if they ask again later I remind them they\u2019ve already gotten that treat and they accept that. I don\u2019t even really restrict it to time of day. Like they can\u2019t have ice cream for breakfast but if once about lunchtime hits if they ask for a treat they can have it then but that means they can\u2019t ask for something later. They\u2019re cool with that and it gives them some control over their choice to get the treat right then or save it for later. Hell my daughter will doe a good one and eat half now and save the other half for later \ud83d\ude02 \n\nLater usually results in us tossing it because she forgets to get it later. But she\u2019s learning to listen to her body and stop when she\u2019s full even if it does mean only eating half a slice of cake or bowl of ice cream.", "Its always the donuts. \n\nI remember in youth group (ages ago, when I was a teen) there was a weird homeschool family who were super restrictive about sugar and processed food. Like, they ground the wheat they grew and made their own bread, restrictive.\n\nYou could not trust a single one of those kids near the activity refreshments. \n\nOnce the eldest girl stepped away from the activity to 'go to the bathroom,' but actually snuck into the church kitchen and ate 2 1/2 DOZEN donuts before anyone caught her.\n\nJust double-fisted them as fast as she could, because they never got donuts at home.", "Well...they both have similar amounts of sugar (and the smoothie might have more depending on size), but as far as \"healthier\" goes, the smoothie still comes out on top. Smoothies do retain some vitamins from the fruit, and the sugar is mostly natural. If the skins are blended in there is fiber, and you can easily add veggies and protein if you choose (I do understand that smoothies you order at a restaurant will just be fruit blended with sugar)."]}
