Part of that discussion was how so many parents do their children disservice by feeding them so much garbage and processed food, high sugar, etc. We agreed that even though we don't want kids, if we had one it wouldn't be until the age of like 6 or 7 that we introduce high-sugar foods on a limited basis. \n\n\n\nYesterday, I visited my sister and 2 Y.O. niece.

That's honestly a gross perspective. First she accuses you of not caring about your niece because you did something *totally normal and harmless* and got her some icecream at a parent's request. Second, what is this \"strong man\" crap? You being a man has nothing to do with the situation. Third, not your kid, not your business if your sister is okay with her having sugar.\n\nAlso, just gonna throw out that your guys' ideas around sugar seem to be rather militant. And that can be just as harmful to a child and their relationship with food as being overly permissive with the amount of sugar they're allowed to consume.\n\nBut for getting your niece some icecream? NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your business what your sister allows her kids to have-within reason. Heroin? No. Ice cream on occasion? Absolutely. Your GF needs to have several seats and let an otherwise good mother parent however she sees fit. \n\nYou all are free to have hypothetical scenarios but I assure you, they are hypothetical. Things change when you actually have tiny humans living with and depending on you.", "Your response to a song about body images and EDs is to shame kids eating habits? You\u2019re NTA for the ice cream trip, but you and your gf definitely are for that. Teaching kids to have a healthy relationship with food is important, and you don\u2019t accomplish that by being restrictive and banning things.", "Info: don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a MASSIVE overstep and red flag that your GF thinks she has the right to involve herself in your relationship with your family and insist on questioning your sister\u2019s parenting? Why did you apologise for not doing anything wrong for - shock, horror - getting your own niece an ice cream?!", "NTA your gf is really annoying. She's being judgmental and giving unsolicited parenting advice  which is bad enough but even worse from non-parents.  Also, she's doesn't know what she's talking about if she thinks a smoothie is a low-sugar alternative to ice cream. She's going to be an insufferable parent with an unhealthy attitude about food.", "NTA. It's not yours and your gf's role to police your sister's parenting.\n\nAlso, having been the parent of small kids, I can tell you first-hand how sad it is to watch a 4yo at a birthday party who isn't allowed to eat the cake, but must make do with the *delicious, healthy* organic carrot sticks from mommy's handbag. Those are the kids who will make themselves sick on party food as soon as they're unsupervised, because their parents make such a big f-ing deal about every single thing they eat and they've never had a moment to just eat what all the other kids are eating.", "you and your gf are both assholes. While I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t force your beliefs on your sister and her niece, this kind of mindset is how kids get eating disorders later. \n\nThat being said NTA in this particular instance since you at least know to stay in your lane when it comes to other children unlike your gf apparently.", "NTA\n\nYou and your gf can parent your own children if and when it's time to do that. Your sister asked you to take your niece out for a treat (and to presumably give her a break), and you did what she asked. She's the parent here.\n\nYour girlfriend needs to stay in her lane.", "NTA. Not being a mother, your girlfriend doesn't really understand what it's like to have someone give you unsolicited parenting advice. Especially the type that sounds like you're finding fault with their methods (in a situation where there isn't actual abuse). I think you're right not to make a comment about ice cream in a one-off situation that resulted in some good bonding time with your niece.", "NTA. It's way more damaging to children to foist adult issues with food onto them.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with kids enjoying sweets every now and again as long as it's not in excess and they have a relatively healthy diet.\n\nThere is also nothing wrong with an Uncle spoiling his niece and helping his sister out on a bad day. Probably brightened her day a lot to see you doting on her kiddo too.", ">and made an alternative suggestion like going to get a smoothie\n\nThis right here just proves you two don't really know what you're talking about and should probably stop judging people for innocuous activities such as going for ice cream.\n\nUnless you're giving your 2yr old niece a green smoothie that you made yourself, smoothies have just as much if not more sugar in them than ice cream does.  In fact most smoothies are made from ice cream! Or if you're going with a fruit smoothie, that's all just condensed fruit juice that's far too much sugar if you're as concerned about sugar as you two say you are.\n\nIt's one thing to treat someone with an ice cream, it's another to revolve an entire diet around sugar foods, or more importantly food that is converted to surgar like any wheat product. Bread for example converts into sugar in your body, and store bought bread as a ton of sugar added, are you concerned about removing bread from your 2yr old nieces diet too?", "There's nothing wrong with ice cream now and then as a treat. A healthy attitude towards food includes understanding that treats now and then are fine.\n\nSame goes with soda. Don't drink it as a daily beverage. It's fine to have pizza and soda when you're at someone's birthday party.\n\nNTA", "NTA - You didn't override the parent's decision based on your own opinions. Also not the AH for keeping your opinion to yourself. Nobody wants to hear your unasked-for opinion. No parent wants to hear your unasked-for opinion about their parenting, and this goes double if you're a non-parent. You did the right thing keeping it to yourself. GF needs to keep her nose out of your family dynamic. \n\nAlso, if girlfriend is suggesting \"get a smoothie instead\", she's pretty fucking clueless - smoothies are chock-full of sugar.", "NTA\n\nIf you tried to backseat parent,  you would have been the asshole.   Your sister's daughter means your sister's rules apply,  not yours and certainly not your girlfriends.", "NTA. For taking for an ice cream.\n\nGF is as are for even thinking of suggesting alternatives.\n\nYOU ARE NOT THE PARENTS. If there is no abuse, no one gets to make choices for other kids.\n\nSugar now and again isn't unhealthy. Now, on that, you do realize that even fruits and certain ones have high sugar content that can be what you would think aa unhealthy.\n\nSo a smoothy can be just as unhealthy. Also, more so depends on what is put in it. \n\nHow you guys would parent is your choice but by even a basic suggestion for alternatives you are telling and suggesting to a parent that they are unhealthy and being bad parents by their choice. That you think they are bad parents enough that you have to try and get them to change their lifestyle to what you want. \n\nSee it from the other side. YOUR GF got so upset you did this. To a kid who isn't HERS.  If it was your kid and it was suggested to get them an ice cream, how much more would she fly off the handle. How much would she feel disrespected or judged for her choices. But she wants you to do the same.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t let your GF spend any time with your niece. She will ensure she grows up to have an eating disorder.", "NTA. Your girlfriend\u2019s views on food, and female bodies/strong male role models are just as likely to cause disordered eating in children as taking a child out for occasional ice cream. A healthy relationship with food recognizes that nothing is banned. Fueling the body most important. But an occasional treat is perfectly acceptable.", "NTA-You\u2019re right about not interfering in her parenting.", "NTA, but your GF needs to stay the hell in her lane and if she needs to see you being a \u201cstrong man\u201d about things am she can see you tell her to back off your sister. \n\nDon\u2019t even mention it once to your sister, you already know she feeds her children responsibly. \n\nYour GF and your idea to not feed your future children sugar until they are 6-7 is hypothetical and likely won\u2019t happen. Regardless is is not your place or hers to judge how other people decide to feed their children.", "NTA.\n\n1) Everyone's a perfect parent until they actually have to be a parent. Your GF can have any ideals she likes about parenting now, but a lot will change if you do actually have a child\n\n2) There's growing evidence that shows not placing super strict limits on sugar after the age of 2 helps children learn self-control and moderation. If it's completely restricted, they'll be more likely to binge on it when they do have access to it. There's no such thing as 'good' food and 'bad' food - it's neutral.\n\n3) Your niece is not your child so you, and certainly your girlfriend, don't get to dictate how your niece is raised. You're right it would've been seriously passive aggressive to make a comment to your sister.\n\n4) Taking a toddler for ice cream is such a lovely activity. Your GF sounds seriously uptight and miserable.", "NTA. Your gf sounds insufferable.", "Side note if you want to be a strong male figure and encourage body issues, the wrong way to do that is to restrict sugar.  The amount of research out there about how restriction causes much higher levels of eating disorders and body dysmorphia is endless.  Much better for a 2 year old to have a scoop of ice cream than watch her uncle challenge her mom on how that may not be good for her.", "You and your GF are judgy assholes. You don't have kids, you don't comment on other's choices for their kids, not even one time. Never, ever do that to your sister. \n\nThank you for not procreating.", "NTA, she missed the whole point of that Victoria secret song. She's also not that kids mum and needs to butt out and stay in her lane.", "NTA for taking your niece for ice cream, but YTA for judging other parents for what they feed their kids during your dinner conversation.   I have a child and if I overheard two childless adults talking about how they won\u2019t feed their hypothetical child foods with sugar until they are 6 or 7, I\u2019d roll my eyes.", "NTA sounds like you and your gf need to have a long talk about how you would want to raise kids in the future.   First of all 2 is not a baby.  Second as you said, assuming this isn\u2019t an \u2018app she eats is junk food situation then there\u2019s nothing wrong with this 2 year old going out for ice cream occasionally.", "NTA you are right that your sister is her parent and if she says it\u2019s okay to get icecream than that\u2019s okay. Your gf is the ah . A 2 y.o isn\u2019t going to die from some icecream once in a while. That\u2019s honestly how people end up with ED.", "Your gf isn't a parent and admittedly doesn't want to be one. \n\nShe should keep her damned parenting advice to herself.", "NTA\n\nBut hey, have you got any idea how much sugar is in mothers milk? Or formula for that matter. \nOr fruit, or carrots, or corn?\n\nI agree that you don't want your children to eat lots of highly processed sugary foods. There is however no way that you are going to avoid all high sugar foods.\nDo you plan on being cookies with your kid and then have them taste of ash? \n\nPutting that much emphasis on not eating a certain thing is also likely to lead to eating disorders.\n\nSidenote: \nThere are 7 different types of sugar. \nFructose: found in fruits and honey.\nGalactose: found in milk and dairy products.\nGlucose: found in honey, fruits and vegetables.\nLactose: found in milk, made from glucose and galactose.\nMaltose: found in barley.\nSucrose: made up of glucose and fructose and found in plants.\nXylose: found in wood or straw.", "You are what Jax is singing about you absolute asshole. Food is ok in moderation and by placing moral values on food and restricting food you are setting up issues with food. YTA for even thinking about placing such a negative relationship with food on someone else. Please listen to that song again. I mean really listen.", "NTA.  True, high amounts of sugar are bad for you.  Consider this;  the Apple Kiwi Bunga smoothie (designed for kids)  at Smoothie King has 35 grams of sugar, in comparison 6 ounces of vanilla ice cream has 36 grams of sugar.  Albeit with the smoothie you are getting the majority of the sugar from fruit, while with the ice cream you are getting sugar from milk as well as granulated sugar.  Your body will thank you for the nutrients in the fruit and the milk, but sugar is sugar whatever the form.", "Geez if I were you I'd think twice about having a baby with that control-freak.   Next time tell her to keep her parenting tips to herself, and not control how you interact with your niece, since it's NEITHER of your jobs to parent your niece.   NTA.", "NTA -\n\nThis whole post made me chuckle.\n\nSo two young adults, who don't want to have kids, had a discussion about their opinions on sugar intake of children.\n\n Then they arbitrarily decided that age 6-7 but limited, (I can't forget limited, do they agree on what's \"limited\") was the proper thing to do as parents.  \n\nThen OP does his sister a favor by doing what she asks him to do with her child.  OP's gf when decides that OP is a liar because he didn't try to enforce a standard that they basically pulled out of thin air during a discussion a few days ago on his sister (who you know, actually is raising a child who seems to have a pretty good diet for 2 where you'll beg the child to lick a chicken tender), even though they don't want children where they themselves would actually have to enforce this standard?  \n\nYou both seem like you would be absolute awesome people to be friends with.  We don't have children, we don't want children, we make arbitrary standards for said imaginary children based on a conversation on a date brought on by a song on the radio.  We're not experts in children, children nutrition or anything like that, but we know better.\n\nAnd the gf takes it one step further by wanting OP to enforce this new made up standard on his family.\n\nWow.", "NTA - sorta. Your attitude about sugar, especially not as a parent, is wild. Yes. Too much sugar consumption is bad, period, and it's not good to get kids addicted to sugar at a young age. That said, ice cream as an occasional treat is more than okay.\n\nAlso this made me laugh:\n\n>...an alternative suggestion like going to get a smoothie or something.\n\nDo you have any idea how much sugar is in a lot of smoothies? To illustrate, I compared a basic mango smoothie at Jamba Juice with a scoop of chocolate chip ice cream at Baskin Robbins. The smoothie has 63 grams of sugar compared with 11 grams in the ice cream!", "NTA\n\nYou parented the kid as you were asked to do so.\n\nPeople saying YTA for your eating ideology I think need to read what was said again. Junk / fast foods can lead to addiction and as a parent you have a responsibility to your children to take care of their health. That includes ensuring they don't become overweight / obese. \n\nIs your ideology a bit extreme? Possibly, but I don't think it warrants a YTA. I would suggest rather than focusing on high sugar foods especially, focus on a balanced diet and not over-eating.\n\nYour partner definitely TA. You do not enforce parenting ideology on other peoples kids unless they are in serious danger.", "NTA for taking her for icecream.\nNot giving young children a tonn of sugar is a good idea, but no sugar at all is not realistic at all.

That's how body positivity works, right? \n\nNTA for the ice cream but you and your gf's perspectives are incredibly flawed. \n\nPS every person has a \"I'll never let my kids XYZ\" and then they actually have kids.

I would love a snack, but Uncle can\u2019t really have alot of sugar, can we go get some frozen yogurt instead? If the 2 year old agrees mom will too and you aren\u2019t insulting her parenting choices.

Because their parents never taught them that self-control or restraint regarding healthy eating habits, they just removed that stuff from the equation... which only actually works when the kid is young enough to be watched like a hawk 24/7. \n\nMy parents rarely bought us junk/sugary foods and were super careful to restrict our access to what they did get for us. When I was a kid, my best friend's parents wouldn't let her have *any* sugar or junk foods. The result? At school or summer camp, we'd spend all the money our parents gave us for lunch/water from the vending machine on junk food and soda.

Sounds like there's a pretty strong NTA response. I wanted to make sure there wasn't something I was missing. I was very simply trying to make sure that my action of taking my niece for ice cream did not fly in the face of the one aspect of the earlier convo I had with my gf; I was sure that what I did was a normal, expected behavior regardless of what my feelings were or weren't about what my sister was asking.\n\nAs I expected, there were comments outside of what I was asking, but related to the situation that I'd like to address...\n\n\n\n-We won't have kids, even if we do stay together. Our conversation sparked by the radio was much longer and more broad than simply arriving at a conclusion that hypothetical children of ours would have a limited sugar intake. The definition of \"limited\" was not spelled out nor did it need to be since the situation will not exist. That definitely would have been hashed out, and I absolutely would have brought the mental health/relationship with food issue to the table for that (i.e. moderation creating a more well-adjusted kid who isn't afraid of a few calories and is less likely to hide what they are eating from their parents, less likely to binge and crash and/or develop an ED later (or earlier) in life.\n\n\n\n-My gf is from another country and she grew up eating practically 100% whole foods. Little to no \"factory foods,\" so to speak. She has worked as a nanny here and it was part of her job to feed the kid what the parents asked, even though she didn't agree with those choices. She cares deeply about the kid and it hurt her to watch her parents give her so much junk food and very little fresh \"real\" foods. She watched the child become overweight and unhealthy as a result, so I guess she has some sensitivity to children consuming junk food that I wasn't aware of.  I'm chalking up her insistence on making a suggestion to my sister to a partial lack of cultural awareness - especially with respect to the judgment parents get no matter what decisions they make. I don't think she realizes that the US cultural norm is (or should be) not to give unsolicited advice unless the child is obviously being neglected or abused (and yes, this could mean if they were literally living on a diet of ice cream, which my niece, as I said, most certainly is not). I did not disclose that she is from another country at first because I didn't want any bias in responses. \n\n\n\n-Some of you made some strong statements about us without having all of the information. I can assure you, beyond leading a significantly healthier lifestyle than 99% of people, we are kind, caring people who get along with practically everyone we meet. We hang out with friends (virtually none of whom share in our lifestyle), go out to eat once or twice a week, and have *a beer or two* and dessert (\ud83d\ude31) when we do. But we're at the gym every day, cook fresh meals, work our asses off, take care of our mental health, etc. \n\n-Her response to this situation took me completely off guard and caused one of the worst fights we've had. I don't know if the mental story she created about my behavior just struck a particular nerve in that moment and she overreacted, but she's had some time to reflect and apologized to me today about the whole thing. We had a nice long hug when we got home and things are already better.\n\n\n\n-Final note: I read at least one comment saying that to make a suggestion to my sister would be passive-aggressive. I agree, and I told my gf as much, and that I'm not going to jeopardize my relationship with my sister by saying something I know could and would be taken as passive-aggressive. She does not agree or at least doesn't see how that could be passive-aggressive - maybe that's also a cultural nuance  since parenting is such a hot-button topic in the US; it's not like we're recommending a different brand of motor oil. I'm not going to come back at her with a \"reddit said so,\" but we agreed to ask our respective therapists about this, and if it ever comes up again I can tell her what was said. \n\nI do appreciate your comments, I don't usually crowd-source my relationship advice but she was *so* upset I had to get a reality check. Thanks, all!", "You lost me at posted some ig stories. Loser", "NTA. I once had an instructor who was a doctor. He told stories about nutrition and other things.

My daughter is almost 2 and we have introduced more now. Then last week I picked her up from daycare at snack time and she was eating a jam sandwich and I realised they probably give her way more sugar than we ever did. On the plus side, she does not like ice cream and barely ate any dessert the few times she had the opportunity.", "Exactly! \n\nBefore kids: I'm only feeding them organic magic foods!\nAfter kids: here's a Happy Meal, please leave Mommy alone for thirty seconds.", "Listen to the song again or work on your listening comprehension.   The song is not about body shaming the way you think it is.", "The second half of my comment got deleted, like wtf... anyway...\n\n\n\nI know what the song is about: girls are bombarded with images of an impossible standard for body shape perpetuated throughout mainstream and now even social media. This leads to doing EVERYTHING they can think of to achieve that physique, following garbage advice about nutrition, developing EDs, etc. They get the message that if they don't achieve this, no one will want them, and when their efforts fail they can develop depression, anxiety, drug addictions, risky sexual behavior in a search for validation.... list goes on.  The truth is, this standard is not how they *should* look, it's how \"an old man in Ohio\" thinks they should look. How they *should* look isn't anyone's business but their own.\n\n\nMy ex wife had the most extreme body dysmorphia I've ever seen. Even when she got down to 135 lbs from a high of 192, she had zero gut and still insisted she needed to lose more weight. It was EXHAUSTING and sad to watch happen right in front of me and there was literally nothing I could do. This sense of needing to have not even one fat cell and be cover-model skinny was so deeply ingrained by her anorexic narcissist of a mother that there is virtually no hope for her. After being up close and personal with body dysmorphia, I do see it as my role as a father figure in my niece's lives (my sisters are both single mothers) to make sure they know they are worthy of love and acceptance no matter what. When and if they start going through this I will be stepping in to fulfill this duty.", "Adding on to make sure you get tested once a year or so. I have multiple friends who are oops babies because dad never checked and naturally reversed the procedure. It\u2019s not a one and done thing like a lot of people assume.", "That all sounds great and you understand they song, I just don't know what any of that has to do with giving a kid ice cream once in a while.  By saying no sugar til 7 you are buying into what the song is railing against.", "My urologist insists it's not necessary since he did a triple threat (cut/shorten, cauterize, suture), but I actually agree with you. I can't risk that happening. I might just get a microscope though \ud83d\ude05"]}
