Part of that discussion was how so many parents do their children disservice by feeding them so much garbage and processed food, high sugar, etc. We agreed that even though we don't want kids, if we had one it wouldn't be until the age of like 6 or 7 that we introduce high-sugar foods on a limited basis. \n\n\n\nYesterday, I visited my sister and 2 Y.O. niece. My sister had a rough day at work and needed some time alone, so she asked me to take her daughter for ice cream. So I did, and I posted a couple IG stories of uncle/niece time. My gf saw the posts and got really upset, sparking an argument where she felt like I was lying to her during the discussion we had on our date. She thought that I should have asked my sister \"don't you think that's a lot of sugar for her?\" (Which I think would've been be passive aggressive) and made an alternative suggestion like going to get a smoothie or something.\n\n\nI agreed it would be a good idea to make that suggestion next time (if that happens), but also said that if my sister gives my niece ice cream, it's not my business to inject parenting advice - especially since i respect her and she is a very health-conscious person who understands diabetes and other issues related to sugar. I also know that she feeds her daughter lots of fruits and veggies and freshly cooked proteins. Some snacks, yes but overall leaps and bounds more healthy than most US kids. If giving her daughter ice cream once in a while is something she does, then my taking or not taking her one time isn't going to make a difference.\n\n\n\nA big fight ensued, her main point was that if I care about my nieces why wouldn't I be a strong man and say something to my sister about sugar consumption? My point was that as a man my family is my #1 and I'm not going to say something passive aggressive to risk making things weird with my sister even if I disagree with a very small aspect of her child-rearing approach.

That's honestly a gross perspective. First she accuses you of not caring about your niece because you did something *totally normal and harmless* and got her some icecream at a parent's request. Second, what is this \"strong man\" crap? You being a man has nothing to do with the situation. Third, not your kid, not your business if your sister is okay with her having sugar.\n\nAlso, just gonna throw out that your guys' ideas around sugar seem to be rather militant. And that can be just as harmful to a child and their relationship with food as being overly permissive with the amount of sugar they're allowed to consume.\n\nBut for getting your niece some icecream? NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your business what your sister allows her kids to have-within reason. Heroin? No. Ice cream on occasion? Absolutely. Your GF needs to have several seats and let an otherwise good mother parent however she sees fit. \n\nYou all are free to have hypothetical scenarios but I assure you, they are hypothetical. Things change when you actually have tiny humans living with and depending on you.", "Your response to a song about body images and EDs is to shame kids eating habits? You\u2019re NTA for the ice cream trip, but you and your gf definitely are for that. Teaching kids to have a healthy relationship with food is important, and you don\u2019t accomplish that by being restrictive and banning things.", "Info: don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a MASSIVE overstep and red flag that your GF thinks she has the right to involve herself in your relationship with your family and insist on questioning your sister\u2019s parenting? Why did you apologise for not doing anything wrong for - shock, horror - getting your own niece an ice cream?!", "NTA your gf is really annoying. She's being judgmental and giving unsolicited parenting advice  which is bad enough but even worse from non-parents.  Also, she's doesn't know what she's talking about if she thinks a smoothie is a low-sugar alternative to ice cream. She's going to be an insufferable parent with an unhealthy attitude about food.", "NTA. It's not yours and your gf's role to police your sister's parenting.\n\nAlso, having been the parent of small kids, I can tell you first-hand how sad it is to watch a 4yo at a birthday party who isn't allowed to eat the cake, but must make do with the *delicious, healthy* organic carrot sticks from mommy's handbag. Those are the kids who will make themselves sick on party food as soon as they're unsupervised, because their parents make such a big f-ing deal about every single thing they eat and they've never had a moment to just eat what all the other kids are eating.", "you and your gf are both assholes. While I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t force your beliefs on your sister and her niece, this kind of mindset is how kids get eating disorders later. \n\nThat being said NTA in this particular instance since you at least know to stay in your lane when it comes to other children unlike your gf apparently.", "NTA\n\nYou and your gf can parent your own children if and when it's time to do that. Your sister asked you to take your niece out for a treat (and to presumably give her a break), and you did what she asked. She's the parent here.\n\nYour girlfriend needs to stay in her lane.", "NTA. Not being a mother, your girlfriend doesn't really understand what it's like to have someone give you unsolicited parenting advice. Especially the type that sounds like you're finding fault with their methods (in a situation where there isn't actual abuse). I think you're right not to make a comment about ice cream in a one-off situation that resulted in some good bonding time with your niece.", "NTA. It's way more damaging to children to foist adult issues with food onto them.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with kids enjoying sweets every now and again as long as it's not in excess and they have a relatively healthy diet.\n\nThere is also nothing wrong with an Uncle spoiling his niece and helping his sister out on a bad day. Probably brightened her day a lot to see you doting on her kiddo too.", ">and made an alternative suggestion like going to get a smoothie\n\nThis right here just proves you two don't really know what you're talking about and should probably stop judging people for innocuous activities such as going for ice cream.\n\nUnless you're giving your 2yr old niece a green smoothie that you made yourself, smoothies have just as much if not more sugar in them than ice cream does.  In fact most smoothies are made from ice cream! Or if you're going with a fruit smoothie, that's all just condensed fruit juice that's far too much sugar if you're as concerned about sugar as you two say you are.\n\nIt's one thing to treat someone with an ice cream, it's another to revolve an entire diet around sugar foods, or more importantly food that is converted to surgar like any wheat product. Bread for example converts into sugar in your body, and store bought bread as a ton of sugar added, are you concerned about removing bread from your 2yr old nieces diet too?", "There's nothing wrong with ice cream now and then as a treat. A healthy attitude towards food includes understanding that treats now and then are fine.\n\nSame goes with soda. Don't drink it as a daily beverage. It's fine to have pizza and soda when you're at someone's birthday party.\n\nNTA", "NTA - You didn't override the parent's decision based on your own opinions. Also not the AH for keeping your opinion to yourself. Nobody wants to hear your unasked-for opinion. No parent wants to hear your unasked-for opinion about their parenting, and this goes double if you're a non-parent. You did the right thing keeping it to yourself. GF needs to keep her nose out of your family dynamic. \n\nAlso, if girlfriend is suggesting \"get a smoothie instead\", she's pretty fucking clueless - smoothies are chock-full of sugar.", "NTA\n\nIf you tried to backseat parent,  you would have been the asshole.   Your sister's daughter means your sister's rules apply,  not yours and certainly not your girlfriends.", "NTA. For taking for an ice cream.\n\nGF is as are for even thinking of suggesting alternatives.\n\nYOU ARE NOT THE PARENTS. If there is no abuse, no one gets to make choices for other kids.\n\nSugar now and again isn't unhealthy. Now, on that, you do realize that even fruits and certain ones have high sugar content that can be what you would think aa unhealthy.\n\nSo a smoothy can be just as unhealthy. Also, more so depends on what is put in it. \n\nHow you guys would parent is your choice but by even a basic suggestion for alternatives you are telling and suggesting to a parent that they are unhealthy and being bad parents by their choice. That you think they are bad parents enough that you have to try and get them to change their lifestyle to what you want. \n\nSee it from the other side. YOUR GF got so upset you did this. To a kid who isn't HERS.  If it was your kid and it was suggested to get them an ice cream, how much more would she fly off the handle. How much would she feel disrespected or judged for her choices. But she wants you to do the same.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t let your GF spend any time with your niece. She will ensure she grows up to have an eating disorder.", "NTA. Your girlfriend\u2019s views on food, and female bodies/strong male role models are just as likely to cause disordered eating in children as taking a child out for occasional ice cream. A healthy relationship with food recognizes that nothing is banned. Fueling the body most important. But an occasional treat is perfectly acceptable.", "NTA-You\u2019re right about not interfering in her parenting.", "NTA, but your GF needs to stay the hell in her lane and if she needs to see you being a \u201cstrong man\u201d about things am she can see you tell her to back off your sister. \n\nDon\u2019t even mention it once to your sister, you already know she feeds her children responsibly. \n\nYour GF and your idea to not feed your future children sugar until they are 6-7 is hypothetical and likely won\u2019t happen. Regardless is is not your place or hers to judge how other people decide to feed their children.", "NTA.\n\n1) Everyone's a perfect parent until they actually have to be a parent. Your GF can have any ideals she likes about parenting now, but a lot will change if you do actually have a child\n\n2) There's growing evidence that shows not placing super strict limits on sugar after the age of 2 helps children learn self-control and moderation. If it's completely restricted, they'll be more likely to binge on it when they do have access to it. There's no such thing as 'good' food and 'bad' food - it's neutral.\n\n3) Your niece is not your child so you, and certainly your girlfriend, don't get to dictate how your niece is raised. You're right it would've been seriously passive aggressive to make a comment to your sister.\n\n4) Taking a toddler for ice cream is such a lovely activity. Your GF sounds seriously uptight and miserable.", "NTA. Your gf sounds insufferable.", "Side note if you want to be a strong male figure and encourage body issues, the wrong way to do that is to restrict sugar.  The amount of research out there about how restriction causes much higher levels of eating disorders and body dysmorphia is endless.  Much better for a 2 year old to have a scoop of ice cream than watch her uncle challenge her mom on how that may not be good for her.", "You and your GF are judgy assholes. You don't have kids, you don't comment on other's choices for their kids, not even one time. Never, ever do that to your sister. \n\nThank you for not procreating.", "NTA, she missed the whole point of that Victoria secret song. She's also not that kids mum and needs to butt out and stay in her lane.", "NTA for taking your niece for ice cream, but YTA for judging other parents for what they feed their kids during your dinner conversation.   I have a child and if I overheard two childless adults talking about how they won\u2019t feed their hypothetical child foods with sugar until they are 6 or 7, I\u2019d roll my eyes.", "NTA sounds like you and your gf need to have a long talk about how you would want to raise kids in the future.   First of all 2 is not a baby.  Second as you said, assuming this isn\u2019t an \u2018app she eats is junk food situation then there\u2019s nothing wrong with this 2 year old going out for ice cream occasionally.", "NTA you are right that your sister is her parent and if she says it\u2019s okay to get icecream than that\u2019s okay. Your gf is the ah . A 2 y.o isn\u2019t going to die from some icecream once in a while. That\u2019s honestly how people end up with ED.", "Your gf isn't a parent and admittedly doesn't want to be one. \n\nShe should keep her damned parenting advice to herself.", "NTA\n\nBut hey, have you got any idea how much sugar is in mothers milk? Or formula for that matter. \nOr fruit, or carrots, or corn?\n\nI agree that you don't want your children to eat lots of highly processed sugary foods. There is however no way that you are going to avoid all high sugar foods.\nDo you plan on being cookies with your kid and then have them taste of ash? \n\nPutting that much emphasis on not eating a certain thing is also likely to lead to eating disorders.\n\nSidenote: \nThere are 7 different types of sugar. \nFructose: found in fruits and honey.\nGalactose: found in milk and dairy products.\nGlucose: found in honey, fruits and vegetables.\nLactose: found in milk, made from glucose and galactose.\nMaltose: found in barley.\nSucrose: made up of glucose and fructose and found in plants.\nXylose: found in wood or straw.", "You are what Jax is singing about you absolute asshole. Food is ok in moderation and by placing moral values on food and restricting food you are setting up issues with food. YTA for even thinking about placing such a negative relationship with food on someone else. Please listen to that song again. I mean really listen.", "NTA.  True, high amounts of sugar are bad for you.  Consider this;  the Apple Kiwi Bunga smoothie (designed for kids)  at Smoothie King has 35 grams of sugar, in comparison 6 ounces of vanilla ice cream has 36 grams of sugar.  Albeit with the smoothie you are getting the majority of the sugar from fruit, while with the ice cream you are getting sugar from milk as well as granulated sugar.  Your body will thank you for the nutrients in the fruit and the milk, but sugar is sugar whatever the form.", "Geez if I were you I'd think twice about having a baby with that control-freak.   Next time tell her to keep her parenting tips to herself, and not control how you interact with your niece, since it's NEITHER of your jobs to parent your niece.   NTA.", "NTA -\n\nThis whole post made me chuckle.\n\nSo two young adults, who don't want to have kids, had a discussion about their opinions on sugar intake of children.\n\n Then they arbitrarily decided that age 6-7 but limited, (I can't forget limited, do they agree on what's \"limited\") was the proper thing to do as parents.  \n\nThen OP does his sister a favor by doing what she asks him to do with her child.  OP's gf when decides that OP is a liar because he didn't try to enforce a standard that they basically pulled out of thin air during a discussion a few days ago on his sister (who you know, actually is raising a child who seems to have a pretty good diet for 2 where you'll beg the child to lick a chicken tender), even though they don't want children where they themselves would actually have to enforce this standard?  \n\nYou both seem like you would be absolute awesome people to be friends with.  We don't have children, we don't want children, we make arbitrary standards for said imaginary children based on a conversation on a date brought on by a song on the radio.  We're not experts in children, children nutrition or anything like that, but we know better.\n\nAnd the gf takes it one step further by wanting OP to enforce this new made up standard on his family.\n\nWow.", "NTA - sorta. Your attitude about sugar, especially not as a parent, is wild. Yes. Too much sugar consumption is bad, period, and it's not good to get kids addicted to sugar at a young age. That said, ice cream as an occasional treat is more than okay.\n\nAlso this made me laugh:\n\n>...an alternative suggestion like going to get a smoothie or something.\n\nDo you have any idea how much sugar is in a lot of smoothies? To illustrate, I compared a basic mango smoothie at Jamba Juice with a scoop of chocolate chip ice cream at Baskin Robbins. The smoothie has 63 grams of sugar compared with 11 grams in the ice cream!", "NTA\n\nYou parented the kid as you were asked to do so.\n\nPeople saying YTA for your eating ideology I think need to read what was said again. Junk / fast foods can lead to addiction and as a parent you have a responsibility to your children to take care of their health. That includes ensuring they don't become overweight / obese. \n\nIs your ideology a bit extreme? Possibly, but I don't think it warrants a YTA. I would suggest rather than focusing on high sugar foods especially, focus on a balanced diet and not over-eating.\n\nYour partner definitely TA. You do not enforce parenting ideology on other peoples kids unless they are in serious danger.", "NTA for taking her for icecream.\nNot giving young children a tonn of sugar is a good idea, but no sugar at all is not realistic at all.

That's how body positivity works, right? \n\nNTA for the ice cream but you and your gf's perspectives are incredibly flawed. \n\nPS every person has a \"I'll never let my kids XYZ\" and then they actually have kids.

I would love a snack, but Uncle can\u2019t really have alot of sugar, can we go get some frozen yogurt instead? If the 2 year old agrees mom will too and you aren\u2019t insulting her parenting choices.

Because their parents never taught them that self-control or restraint regarding healthy eating habits, they just removed that stuff from the equation... which only actually works when the kid is young enough to be watched like a hawk 24/7. \n\nMy parents rarely bought us junk/sugary foods and were super careful to restrict our access to what they did get for us. When I was a kid, my best friend's parents wouldn't let her have *any* sugar or junk foods. The result? At school or summer camp, we'd spend all the money our parents gave us for lunch/water from the vending machine on junk food and soda. When I went to college I'd spend my food money on Doritos, Mountain Dew, and boxed mac'n'cheese instead of actual food. That friend I mentioned  wasn't even allowed to eat a slice of cake at birthday parties, and developed severe body issues and an eating disorder by the time we hit middle school... which her mom openly encouraged, because it meant she wasn't eating junk food. \n\nTotal prohibition on this stuff doesn't actually work. It just gets you kids who binge out on junk foods/sugar at every chance they get and/or kids who feel unhealthy amounts of shame, fear, and guilt whenever they consume a single slice of cake. It's an all-but-guaranteed recipe for a teenager/adult with some variety of deep-seated eating disorder. You need to find ways to teach actual, healthy methods of self-restraint and moderation when it comes to junk food/sugar, and education on *why* that's necessary beyond \"Because it's bad for you and because I said so\", not just forbid/restrict it outright.", "Avoiding sugar until a kid is 6 or 7 will only cause an eating disorder. Its about balance.", "I agree about the militant part. My mother never served cake, cookies, or ice cream. Candy was limited to Christmas and Halloween. As we left home each of us became sugarholics. We\u2019ve calmed down a lot and eat much better now. Dad was diabetic, hence her attitude. We are all over 60 now and none of us (6) are diabetic.", "A lot of studies have proven that putting sugar on a pedestal is equally harmful. Moderation is key in all things. A few bites of ice cream in the summer, an occasional cookie along with fresh fruits and vegetables would go further in helping the child create a better relationship with food.", "I know I'm laughing at the idea of this hypothetical kid never having ice cream or any sugar until they're 7. Ah, to be so young and naive!", "Given that our children are imaginary, I don't care how much sugar they have, lol. We agreed that we aren't going to be pushy about this. We'll mention it once if needed and leave it alone after, it's not our business.", "When the gf is a mother you know she'll be all \"my child, my rules\" but she doesn't practice that for other people's children, I guess.", "I did think it was an overstep, and I let her know that. I said, \"What if we make that comment and nothing changes?\" She agreed that it wouldn't be worth pursuing any further if that was the case, which I thought was reasonable.\n\n\n\nMy apology to her was not for taking my niece for ice cream but for not seeing/accepting her point at first that making an alternative suggestion like going to get a smoothie or even froyo would have been better. When and if I'm in such a situation again, I have no problem suggesting an alternative.", "They said they don't want kids.. I like to think we're all breathing a sigh of relief at that.", "I was waiting for this, depending on the smoothie, it could be way worse than ice cream, in terms of sugar content. \nAlso, wtf is up with this title? A two year old isn't a \"young baby\"", "God, the picture you just put in my head with this comment is devastating. Think ill go make my kids a root beer float, since they have already had two healthy meals and done their chores (amazing at only 11:15 am!!!!)", "I actually called her out on this: \"let's reverse roles here. If I saw something someone in your family was doing and thought it was stupid, I would tell you. I would even say to you that I thought it was stupid because your family member is putting theirself in a bad situation/making their life worse. I would, however, never tell you that I had some expectation to you to talk to them about it, nor would I take it upon myself to say anything to them. It's your family, and even though I care about them, it's not my business.\"", "I agree, it's not my place. How other people parent does not affect me. I did say that if I ever felt that my sister(s) were making REALLY REALLY bad choices with their childrens' nutrition/health, I would definitely say something, but that would only be if I thought they were getting concerningly overweight and weren't active etc. Both of these things are, however, things I know my sisters will not let happen.", "\"Enforce\" is strong for what she was pushing for, which was a mere suggestion for an alternative one time, and then it would be left alone after that. I agree \"no sugar\" is extreme, but I also don't think people realize how much is in everyday foods in the US, not to mention all the processed junk. Not saying I eat 100% clean all the time but I do OK.", "I have a friend who had severe gastritis when he had his first high dose of sugar at 10 years old. His parents were Japanese and I don't think they restricted sweets but definitely preferred those that were lower in sugar than in the US, and smaller portions.\n\n\n\nSo when he had his first Mountain Dew at 10 years old he thought he was dying.", "I love my niece and would never try to suck the fun away from her. Which is why our convo from a few days ago never entered my mind - I'm not going to ruin my relationship with her or my sister by being judgmental, and I'm not even silently judging her. I misunderstood what my gf was saying I guess, I didn't know that our convo implicitly meant to her that I would say anything to my siblings about parenting.", "Or in school!  I hope one of them is planning on being a SAHP because you do not get to pick and choose the food your kid gets at daycare.  Not that they pile then with sugar but they definitely get special treats on birthdays and holidays.  If you let them around any other kids at all you are either going to have to teach the moderation or explain why all the other kids can have sweets and they can't (which alone could lead to eating disorders when you say little Janet's parents are feeding her bad food which is bad for her, wait until your kid tells Janet that).  And isolating your kids until age 7 is gonna lead to so many other problems.  \n\nKnew a girl with parents like this and she had such a bad relationship with food.  Wasn't even allowed a birthday cake, her parents cut a watermelon in half and stuck candles in it.  Once she got out she was the biggest junk food junkie in the world.  \n\nSeven years old is way older than you think.  A seven year old with no access to sugar is going to lie and steal to get around you.", "Lmao this reminds me of that clip that was viral a few years ago of Kourtney Kardashian planning a child\u2019s sugar free birthday party.", "Or any birthday party or holiday party\u2026", "I really hope he won't have kids with this woman... she'll ruin their childhood.", "This very much feels like the promises you make to yourself when you don't at all understand the reality of having children. The perfect parents are the ones with no kids.", "Lol. My plan was to only give heavy diluted juice for at least the first few years. \n\nThen we went to a friend's house and she saw her bestie drinking from a juice box. There went that idea!", "I laughed too.\n\nMy parents actually did this with me - no processed sugar for years! (They didn\u2019t choose to keep that line with my younger siblings. Huh.) \n\nI consider it part and parcel of their weird militant neglect they raised me with where they made a bunch of choices that resulted in me suffering for their philosophical purity.\n\nI much prefer the people who decide to have these grand ideas on parenting in theory and then hit reality and make better choices with their actual children.", "I was thinking exactly this too. What is wrong with this couple?", "Exactly! That is still showing a child that food is the enemy rather than forming a healthy relationship with food and their bodies.", "Also, chicken nuggies will be a staple. They just don\u2019t know, yet.", "Don\u2019t even mention it once, I guarantee you won\u2019t get a positive response, and will only cause a rift in your family.", "Do not mention it, not even once!\n\nThe only good reaction will be your sister laughing until she cries at a childless couple giving her parenting advice. The bad outcome will be you being banned from interacting with your niece.", "Sounds like your gf is actually not in agreement you will mention it once\u2026", "Praying that your gf is sterile. Seriously, she'll be a horrible mother.", "It's not your place yo even mention it once and if you did you WBTA. Stay out of matters that don't concern you. If you don't want to take her for ice-cream because of some warped ideal scenario, then don't take her out but keep your unwanted and not asked for opinions to yourself.", "She won't be, neither of us want to be parents.", "do not suggest an alternative. not your job. you were NTA for helping your sister exactly how she asked you, the kid sounds like she has a balanced diet, and if you and your gf heard THAT song by Jax and decided the issue was too much sugar in kids' diets you missed the entire point of the song.", "No seriously don\u2019t even suggest an alternative, that\u2019s a passive aggressive way to tell her you don\u2019t approve of her decision as a parent.", "i find it hilarious that you\u2019re implying a smoothie or frozen yogurt can\u2019t have just as much sugar as ice cream", "Your gf is an idiot if she thinks froyo is better than ice cream for a 2yo.\n\nYou and her both have terrible judgment if you think it's appropriate to comment even once to your family about this.", ">I have no problem suggesting an alternative.\n\nYou'd be a fool to suggest an frozen yogurt or a smoothie over ice cream. Guess what? They all have a ton of sugar and a fruit smoothie is likely to have more than the ice cream.", "Still not your place. All your experience with hypothetical children does not give you the right to override your sister's experience with her actual child. It is not your place to say a damned thing.", "LOL. FroYo or a smoothie would have a high chance of having more added sugars.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 trust me, most people who know me are.", "Yeah it's pretty sad =(", "Yeah we lead a pretty sugar-restricted household by nature because it honestly makes me feel like crap when I eat it. So my kiddo gets basically no ice cream, candy, cookies, etc. at home - we'll go out to ice cream maybe 2-3 times a summer. We thought we were doing an amazing job keeping the super-refined sugars out of his diet. Then one day we brought home bagels and he said: \"donut!!!?\" and we realized he gets donuts on the reg at daycare. And honestly? I'm fine with it. It's probably good. I used to pilfer and binge eat Halloween candy because it was so restricted in my house growing up and that's not what I want for my kid.", "My parents weren't even restrictive and I still stole one of my moms ginger snaps a week and stashed it in my bookshelf for 'later'.    I guess I didn't understand how it was going to go stale...", "My own mother didn\u2019t give me sugar for as long as she could manage. She never expressly forbade it, just never introduced me to it.\n\nThat all ended when I had M&Ms at Sunday school when I was like 4 or 5. \ud83d\ude02 That\u2019s when I started having candy.", "What? I thought it was fish fingers.\nBut maybe that's just my kid. She loves cheese too.", "Good, the next step is to understand that no parent wants to hear your opinion on what they are doing with their child. If it isn't dangerous, keep your mouth shut. Ice cream is so low stakes, I don't know why you'd want to be that obnoxious guy over it.", "So... you acknowledge that it's hard.  It is hard and exhausting and it is a think you don't take lightly- so stop telling other people how to do it.  And stop thinking you would be an amazing parent if you only wanted to.", "Good. She'll be horrible", "The discussion was much more broad than simply \"high amounts of sugar are bad for kids.\" That was a part she brought up. My focal point of that song is the \"fakeness\" of what is seen", "For real.  They have strong opinions for knowing very little about what they're trying to preach.", "More cause of your GF tbh. She would totally screw up a daughter based on the info we have to go on..you sound pretty normal lol", "If you truly don't want kids and you haven't done it already, get a vasectomy. Lower the chance of an accident, because neither you nor your girlfriend are at all prepared for the reality of parenthood.", "Good you are understanding how food restriction affected you, but aren't you concerned that your restrictions now are going to likewise affect your kid?", "yeah, you don't want to so restrict food that kids have an unhealthy relationship with it.\n\ni know people whose parents basically did what OP is suggesting and he and his siblings used to just gorge on sugar every chance that they got.", "Mmm\u2026Mac n cheese. I just decided what I\u2019m doing for dinner!", "the point of the song is fakeness via pressuring women to appear a certain way even if it's not realistic-- this includes rigid eating habits and eating disorders and body image issues. the fact that your gf is already so gung-ho about sugar for kids that she's willing to give YOU crap for helping your sister in a way your sister asked, including suggesting that next time you suggest a \"healthier\" snack, is a red flag that she's falling into restrictive beliefs and patterns and trying to force them on others.", "I had one 2 years ago lol.", "We don't really \"restrict\" so much as we just, as a family, don't really eat dessert or keep sugary foods around because they're not my everyday thing (ask me about my Cheezit habit, tho!), but obviously, yes, it's something I think about a lot. I do think there's a difference between not giving a toddler candy, and telling a nine year old she can't eat candy - I definitely plan to modify how I approach sweet foods as my kid ages out of toddlerhood."]}
