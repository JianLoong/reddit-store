Even when you had no responsibility to her, her child, or her marriage, you went out of your way to be sure she and the kid had a support system that doesn\u2019t include you.

It was more than kind that you informed people so she didn't do anything rash.

You aren't her keeper.\n\nThe only person I feel bad for in thier home is the baby.  Sounds like you dodged a bullet, though.
