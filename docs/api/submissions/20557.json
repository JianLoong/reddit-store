Neither my ex or current partner give a damn but some people clearly do. My exasperation with this mindset aside this is the time to gently sit down and talk through this with your partner and figure out her insecurities. You're right that it isn't a biggie but her issue is that she didn't know until now so even if you did forget she is probably worrying that it's because there is something to hide. So you need to work through that together. I don't agree with your girlfriends stance but it is the prevailing mindset among a lot of people and her insecurity makes sense but she's wrong to demand you cut your best friend from the wedding.

They\u2019ve been best friends for over a decade!! They briefly tried dating back in high school and quickly realized they didn\u2019t feel that way about each other.

He could have say so listen, he has been my best friend for years, we tried dating for two months, it didn\u2018t work.\n\nI think you should just be honest at the beginning of every relationship.

This is a totally normal thing. Does not indicate any troubling pattern or anything.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to characterize a best friend of 10 years as simple an \u201cex-fling\u201d", "Exactly as you say. People have selective memory.\nPart of being in a relationship is trust.\n\nIf this breaks the trust, maybe they should postpone the entire wedding.\n\nIt reeks of bigger problems than just the alleged disrespect of a best man who used to be a lover.", "I\u2019ve hooked up with a friend or two and quickly realized that there was no chemistry there and we were just friends. More than a decade later, I\u2019d just be thinking of them as a friend and not thinking about the sex from years ago since I\u2019m not hung up on it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s super relevant or a big deal not to mention.", "The issue is he forgot.\nYou never had the situation where you listed your exes in your head (or aloud for your current partner) and later on you think \"sh$$, forgot one\"?\n\nIt happens.\nIn my case, it happened because I'd rather not remember the person in question, and somehow thankfully I usually don't.\n\nIn OP's case, it happened because this person is usually something very different to him, to wit, his best friend.\n\nI don't find that implausable at all.", "Well her reaction is probably stemming from the fact that this is new information to her and she\u2019s not wrong for thinking that you kept it a secret all this time. Because honestly how has it never come up in the 4 years that you\u2019ve been dating?", "I think it\u2019ll always bother her BECAUSE you didn\u2019t tell her. So now she\u2019s wondering why, were you purposefully hiding him, do you love him, etc erc. It\u2019s one thing to knowingly accept your partner\u2019s best friend was also briefly his bf. But she didn\u2019t get a chance to make a choice of whether or not she was okay with that when she began dating you since you weren\u2019t upfront so now she\u2019s going to second guess a lot of things.", "Yep.  And for the record I just see some of my exes as friends. My partner didn\u2019t agrwe", "OP, for the record, I completely understand how you would not think this was a big deal since you only think of him as a friend. NTA, but it\u2019s good to know your fianc\u00e9 feels differently so you can talk about things more openly in the future. But I definitely have a friend from college that once in a while I remember, oh yeah, we had sex once, weird. I totally forget usually because that\u2019s not what I associate with our relationship, and it was mutual. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re lying or being malicious at all. It\u2019s the sort of thing that could have come up earlier, but not necessarily. I mean, unless your fianc\u00e9 has said it\u2019s super important for her to know everyone you\u2019ve ever had sex with I don\u2019t see how this would have come up if it\u2019s not at all relevant in the present. Sitting her down and telling her you briefly dated your best friend 10 years ago makes it sound like something more important than it apparently was. I can see why she might have questions about this, but I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong really, and you deserve to have your best friend in your wedding party.", "Ngl I don\u2019t really see the big deal either.

I agree maybe wait a bit and get right before you spend more time and MONEY on a wedding lol\n\nEdit- and having had sex would make me less trusting and would just overall bother me.", "Were any of these people in your wedding party?", "I agree with you that one can forget a short term ex whom you haven\u2019t seen in years.  But this ex has been his friend for a decade.  He didn\u2019t forget, he lied or he lied by omission.", "He didn\u2019t forget, he just chose not to tell, especially as said person is still in his life.", "He definitely did not forget he just \u201cforgot\u201d to mention it to his fianc\u00e9. It definitely should have come up in conversation previously unless OP was specifically hiding it. His fianc\u00e9 totally has a right to be weirded out", "Aye. I'm not saying she's wrong to be suspicious. But if she is, then that's a cause of worry in and of itself. She shouldn't be rushing into something with a man she doesn't trust.", "I haven\u2019t had a wedding party but if I did, my best friend of over a decade would definitely be in it.", "Agreed.", "And would you tell your fiance that you slept with them, or would you \"forget\", as OP did here?", "NTA, I really do not agree with the most of the comments here.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a cultural thing, but in my home town there was a lot of casual dating in and around our large friend group especially when we were teenagers and early 20s.

I could absolutely have done the same thing as you.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 being insecure at first is understandable I think, but you\u2019ve explained what happened.

Recently, there was a guy on AITA that \"forgot\" to tell his friends and family that he's been married for a whole year.", "Selective memory. I don\u2019t believe people just forget. Maybe not think of or consider it significant but Id remember if I\u2019ve had sex with someone I see often.", "Oh good Lord.  NTA!", "It's just not at the top of my mind because it's not what the relationship defines or builds the core memories of it. I know I was with her and can remember it but it's just not what comes to mind thinking of her.", "He\u2019s not just an ex fling, but he is someone that her fianc\u00e9 has had sex with multiple times and cares about very deeply. To be unaware of that first part is a huge slap in the face", "Well that\u2019s very different. It\u2019s not significant not forgotten.", "I haven\u2019t personally been in OP\u2019s position, but I don\u2019t think OP was being purposefully shady to the point of deserving some of the comments here. I can see it from both sides.", "It's forgotten the same way OP forgot it. It's just not something he thinks about. And while I'm a fan of openness I don't see how a 2 week fling years before the relationship is worth getting so worked up over", "Take off the quotes.  Yes, it's possible.", "Sure, a lot of stuff is possible. It's also highly unlikely. And if it is the truth, that kind of brain lapse should also be pretty concerning to OP's fiance. Who else is he forgetting he slept with?!", "NTA, I believe you legitimately forgot and while I can understand your fianc\u00e9s hurt feelings, I think your reasoning is just that - reasonable. It doesn\u2019t sound like this was a real ex - and while I think you two have to have some conversations so that she can explain her hurt, I don\u2019t think the answer is to remove him from the party.", "Don't even need to read the post. From the title alone YTA", "NTA", "YTA.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal that you dated.  And I think this is something you can definitely both work through as a couple. But her finding out about it now is bound to raise some questions for her.  My partner hooked up with a friend of his a long time ago.  He told me pretty early on, said it was awkward and they never talked about it again, he wasn\u2019t even sure if she remembered.  Just to let me know.  I was like, \u201ceh, it happens\u201d.  We (she and I) actually became close friends ourselves.  Not weird at all.  Now, if I found out about it now, years later, I\u2019d be really suspicious as to what else he hadn\u2019t told me.  It would probably create some problems for sure.", "Would you be ok with it if the situation was reversed?", "YTA for not telling your wife the truth. I don't believe for one second that you \"forgot\" about a sexual relationship you had with your best friend of 10+ years. However, you are NTA for wanting him to be your best man. Talk to your fiance and be honest with her about your friendship.", "YTA. You stated in your post that you forgot that you were with this person. Yet in one of your replies you state that you occasionally joke around with him about it. You haven't forgotten that you dated and had sex with him, and your post is misleading. \n\nAnd regardless of how you currently feel about him, you've never bothered to bring this up to her at any point to gauge how comfortable she would be having you hang out with an ex. Not all of us would be comfortable with something like this, most probably wouldn't. And now from her point of view, you've kept this hidden right up until your wedding. What is she to think of the situation?", "YTA yup. ex boyfriend? really??", "YTA Why are you marrying a woman if you're into sex with men ? I'm genuinely curious.....", "YTA. If your fiance was smart she would cancel the wedding.", "Yta you could have told her ages ago and avoided this but you didn\u2019t and now ur here", "So the male dated his best friend who also a male then decided he was straight. Am Missing something here??? I can see why he forgot to tell her. But it was still wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou had a two-month fling over ten years ago. This guy is important enough to you to be your best man, so clearly you have a long history of friendship that has nothing to do with what you did as teenagers. Your fiance is being pretty controlling.", "They hooked up as teenagers for less than a month over a decade ago - excessive to call it a romantic relationship.", "Was OP openly bi Or out to his fianc\u00e9e? Was OP worried about divulging that more than just the fact him and his BFF hooked up briefly many years ago?", "That is a perfectly valid point of view. If OP feels this way about sexual relationships, then that is also completely valid. Many straight people also share this way of thinking. \n\nShe's also equally allowed to be guarded and conservative about her views on sex and previous sexual partners. Everyone has different standards and perspectives on this issue and they are all valid. Perhaps she is insecure and needs time to accept this information. \n\nThe problem is that he failed to communicate this information to her earlier in the relationship. She didn't have the time to determine how she felt about it, and it's unfair for anyone to expect her to accept this so easily right before their wedding. How can she be expected to not feel jealous so suddenly? \n\nPerhaps more people should think like you do. But they can't be expected to do that overnight and without communication.", "yeah, but me and her are different people, just becuase id be ok with it doenst mean she would be, and thats the point of veiw i failed to see. i didnt realises that something like this could be a big deal to someone bc it wasnt to me. i failed to comunicate and that on me, i fucked up here", "I also would like to add that if this were a relationship with an ex-girlfriend, how many of you supporting OP would still be on his side?", "Bisexual people exist?", "i completely agree im in the wrong here. but i didn't decide i was stright, im bisexual", "He stated in a reply that he occasionally still jokes about it with his best friend. He didn't actually forget, rather he neglected to consider that this information would be important for his current partner to know.", "The same way Danaerys just sort of forgot about the iron fleet! #stillsalty", "Doesn't change the fact OP's fiance deserves to know early on in the relationship and consider if she's cool with it. I don't care how long ago it was or that he's \"forgotten\" (which he hasn't, he stated in another reply that he still jokes about it with his best friend) she simply deserves to know this information.", "Hahahha right \ud83d\ude02", "Especially not when it was \u201cless than a month\u201d good lord!", "For your fianc\u00e9 POV, she's having to digest the new information that you and your best friend dated, and everyone knew apart from her. You even admit you two joked about it, but only when she wasn't present. The evidence points towards either you didn't trust her with this information or you deliberately hide this information from her. May I suggest pre-marital counselling?"]}
