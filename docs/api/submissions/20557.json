To me this would be something you would both laugh at, \u2018remember when we thought we should date.\u2019 I personally wouldn\u2019t see it as a huge red flag, because if we\u2019re honest same sex dating can be a bit different from opposite sex dating!

This is why I always end up over explaining every friend of mine I've had a romantic entanglement with even if it was years ago and irrelevant early on in dating to avoid this drama down the line. Neither my ex or current partner give a damn but some people clearly do. My exasperation with this mindset aside this is the time to gently sit down and talk through this with your partner and figure out her insecurities. You're right that it isn't a biggie but her issue is that she didn't know until now so even if you did forget she is probably worrying that it's because there is something to hide. So you need to work through that together. I don't agree with your girlfriends stance but it is the prevailing mindset among a lot of people and her insecurity makes sense but she's wrong to demand you cut your best friend from the wedding.

Yes she has every right to her feelings and needs time to work through them.\n\nHow many of these YTA have seen an ex sexual partner in pub, super market etc and then gone straight up to their partner and went, see that person that you don't know and  will  probably never see again well I've slept with them.

They\u2019ve been best friends for over a decade!! They briefly tried dating back in high school and quickly realized they didn\u2019t feel that way about each other. Their dating didn\u2019t mean anything to them. It\u2019s something they occasionally look back on and laugh. Their friendship is what is meaningful to them. This is OP\u2019s best friend. Also, even if they did have a meaningful romantic relationship, plenty of people remain friends with their exes without being disrespectful to their current partner. People shouldn\u2019t get married if they don\u2019t feel secure in their relationship and trust their partner.", "yes, shes known im bisexual since we first met as friends", "Not OP, but it's hard to imagine this reaction would be different if the best friend were another gender.", "So the details of your relationship with them weren\u2019t hidden for their entire relationship? That\u2019s the difference. OP is an AH for hiding it and lying about \u201cforgetting about it\u201d, you and your ex are not because you were forthcoming.", "But the difference here is the ex is in the wedding party where as you were only invited as a guest.", "I mean he did say. This person was his best friend for 10 years and his \"boyfriend\" for all of 2 months. He doesn't see him that way.

Why keep it a secret if it isn\u2019t a big deal", "Best place if she had someone she dated as maid of honor how would you feel? Best way to look at it is with her perspective and how you\u2019d feel", "Then maybe does she realize you were a teen?  Maybe she feels he has unresolved feelings?", "NTA. I don't even count anyone I dated in hs as ex's. Those were teenage hormone experiments. And it has been over a decade at this point. I can understand her initial shock, but after reviewing the facts... I'd tell her to get over it.", "Oh good. I do think YTA, but it's not as bad as it could have been. It's odd that in all this time it's never come up and I don't blame your partner for being upset.", "So you have a history of entering relationships with your friends, and your best friend is in your wedding, and someone you've slept with, and also somehow forgot you slept with. It isn't exactly puzzling why this bothers her.", "I completely agree. The only thing that would convince me of that is it there\u2019s women he has canoodled with at the wedding as well.

I just know it\u2019s not something I\u2019d forget. Think of much? Nah but for totally forget? Nah", "He forgot he had sex with his best friend?", "So he could just have told her then? He could have say so listen, he has been my best friend for years, we tried dating for two months, it didn\u2018t work.\n\nI think you should just be honest at the beginning of every relationship. Because he forgot about his dating situation with him, what else didn\u2018t he tell her? Trust issues incoming", "I don\u2019t believe OP is telling the truth.", "it genuinly just never crossed my mind, its never come up while shes been around, the most its brought up is as a joke between me and my best friend when we are alone, and i forget about it by teh time i get home. i never ment to keep it a secret form her but i still should have set a reminder when itc ame up with my friend to tell her, i admit i fucked up here", "if they arnt involved and that person is just a friend i wouldn't care. id feel different if she invited an ex that was only in her life when they were together and they weren't friends, but if its a past relationship that ended and they stay friends, then they are friends first and foremost.  \n\n\nbut i understand she doenst feel the same way, it seems like miscomunication on how we feel about the subject because we never talked about it, and a fuck up form me for never telling her, i just bearly think about it and didnt think it was a big deal, but reading these comments show me that these sort of things can be important to some peopel and i should have said something sooner.", "reading through these comment i dont blame her either, this is 100% on me, i fucked up. in my mind it wasnt abig deal wince we dated when we were 16/15 but i still should have told her long before now", "Someone he dated briefly in high school while otherwise single and decided quickly there was nothing there other than friendship. This is a totally normal thing. Does not indicate any troubling pattern or anything.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to characterize a best friend of 10 years as simple an \u201cex-fling\u201d", "Exactly as you say. People have selective memory.\nPart of being in a relationship is trust.\n\nIf this breaks the trust, maybe they should postpone the entire wedding.\n\nIt reeks of bigger problems than just the alleged disrespect of a best man who used to be a lover.", "I\u2019ve hooked up with a friend or two and quickly realized that there was no chemistry there and we were just friends. More than a decade later, I\u2019d just be thinking of them as a friend and not thinking about the sex from years ago since I\u2019m not hung up on it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s super relevant or a big deal not to mention.", "The issue is he forgot.\nYou never had the situation where you listed your exes in your head (or aloud for your current partner) and later on you think \"sh$$, forgot one\"?\n\nIt happens.\nIn my case, it happened because I'd rather not remember the person in question, and somehow thankfully I usually don't.\n\nIn OP's case, it happened because this person is usually something very different to him, to wit, his best friend.\n\nI don't find that implausable at all.", "Well her reaction is probably stemming from the fact that this is new information to her and she\u2019s not wrong for thinking that you kept it a secret all this time. Because honestly how has it never come up in the 4 years that you\u2019ve been dating?", "I think it\u2019ll always bother her BECAUSE you didn\u2019t tell her. So now she\u2019s wondering why, were you purposefully hiding him, do you love him, etc erc. It\u2019s one thing to knowingly accept your partner\u2019s best friend was also briefly his bf. But she didn\u2019t get a chance to make a choice of whether or not she was okay with that when she began dating you since you weren\u2019t upfront so now she\u2019s going to second guess a lot of things.", "Yep.  And for the record I just see some of my exes as friends. My partner didn\u2019t agrwe", "OP, for the record, I completely understand how you would not think this was a big deal since you only think of him as a friend. NTA, but it\u2019s good to know your fianc\u00e9 feels differently so you can talk about things more openly in the future. But I definitely have a friend from college that once in a while I remember, oh yeah, we had sex once, weird. I totally forget usually because that\u2019s not what I associate with our relationship, and it was mutual. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re lying or being malicious at all. It\u2019s the sort of thing that could have come up earlier, but not necessarily. I mean, unless your fianc\u00e9 has said it\u2019s super important for her to know everyone you\u2019ve ever had sex with I don\u2019t see how this would have come up if it\u2019s not at all relevant in the present. Sitting her down and telling her you briefly dated your best friend 10 years ago makes it sound like something more important than it apparently was. I can see why she might have questions about this, but I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong really, and you deserve to have your best friend in your wedding party.", "Ngl I don\u2019t really see the big deal either. Seems a bit melodramatic frankly", "The whole not telling your fiance that you fucked the best man is not actually normal. \n\nHow many members of your wedding party were you sexually active with, and did you tell your partner?", "I can see where you\u2019re coming from.\nIt would make me question and jump to an,\nWhat else have you \u201cforgotten\u201d?\nAnd especially that this person is still active in their lives. I agree maybe wait a bit and get right before you spend more time and MONEY on a wedding lol\n\nEdit- and having had sex would make me less trusting and would just overall bother me.", "Were any of these people in your wedding party?", "I agree with you that one can forget a short term ex whom you haven\u2019t seen in years.  But this ex has been his friend for a decade.  He didn\u2019t forget, he lied or he lied by omission.", "He didn\u2019t forget, he just chose not to tell, especially as said person is still in his life.", "He definitely did not forget he just \u201cforgot\u201d to mention it to his fianc\u00e9. It definitely should have come up in conversation previously unless OP was specifically hiding it. His fianc\u00e9 totally has a right to be weirded out", "Aye. I'm not saying she's wrong to be suspicious. But if she is, then that's a cause of worry in and of itself. She shouldn't be rushing into something with a man she doesn't trust.", "I haven\u2019t had a wedding party but if I did, my best friend of over a decade would definitely be in it.", "Agreed.", "And would you tell your fiance that you slept with them, or would you \"forget\", as OP did here?"]}
