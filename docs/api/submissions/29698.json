They are notorious for eating exactly at 5pm, but since I work in the office occasionally, and it\u2019s a one hour commute, they will sometimes offer to push dinner so we can eat after I finish commuting back to town. The last three times they have invited me to dinner however, I have arrived to find everyone already eating, most recently, everyone was clearing their plate by the time I walked through the door. For some context, my train arrives to my hometown at 6:13pm and I will be through their door by 6:20pm - if I go over after working from home, I will be there by 5:10pm at the latest. \n\nI come from a family where no one touches their food without everyone at the table and ready to eat, let alone a guest. Since I was raised this way, I find what my boyfriends family is doing completely disrespectful and it hurts my feelings that they OFFER to push dinner, and then eat without me anyways - not to mention the uncomfortableness of also having to eat alone at the table. I\u2019ve brought this up to my bf and he says it\u2019s not a big deal, and that members of his family need to eat at a certain time because of blood sugar issues - also, just to note, my bf has stopped eating before I get there since I told him it bothers me, his family has not. Recently, when they offered to have me for dinner for my birthday after an office day, I politely suggested to my bf that they eat without me and I will come after I get home for cake or something. My boyfriend said he wouldn\u2019t be suggesting that to his parents because it\u2019s rude and ungrateful, and that I can deal with everyone eating before me for one day. \n\nMy stance is pretty firm that if you invite someone for dinner, you shouldn\u2019t eat without them, so I\u2019ve asked him going forward to stop inviting me for family dinners on work/week days. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m overreacting, or over asking but my bf is pretty floored I would suggest that.

I also feel like asking them that may come across as disrespectful or ungrateful like my bf suggested and that this might tarnish my relationship with his parents. Additionally, I believe this could cause problems with my boyfriend, because we don\u2019t share the same perspective and to him it\u2019s not a big deal, especially now that he has stopped eating until I arrive.

Waiting until everyone has arrived is one of the most basic rules of politeness, especially when a guest is involved! NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt's pretty mind boggling that they would ask to host your birthday dinner, but can't be bothered to wait util you get there. And that they would consider it rude and ungrateful for you to want them to wait for you.", "NAH\nBlood sugar issues may mean diabetes. Members of his family may need to eat at a specific time. Perhaps a compromise, you could arrange to go for dinner on says that you work from home", "NTA\n\nThey are either trying to pull a power move on you or they are just completely oblivious to how rude this is, either way, stand your ground.\n\nIf it\u2019s really down to blood sugar levels, they can have an appitzer.", "Yikes, that's awkward. NTA. But maybe suggest a later dinner or a weekend brunch instead? Compromise might be key here.", "NTA. If I invite someone for dinner it's as much about eating together as the food itself. People are different though \u2013 I had a housemate whose mother would send her back from dinner with containers of food for me, and while I wasn't invited to family dinner there was obviously still hospitality there.\n\nBut I'd be uncomfortable too, and inviting someone for a birthday meal and eating it without them is plain weird. I think asking your BF's family to stop inviting you could be taken badly, but asking your boyfriend to respond to invites extended through him with a stock 'thanks, but she'll be late so she'd feel awkward eating by herself' seems diplomatic enough.", "NTA\n\n>My boyfriend said he wouldn\u2019t be suggesting that to his parents because it\u2019s rude and ungrateful, and that I can deal with everyone eating before me for one day. \n\nSo, your boyfriend *can* see and care about rudeness, but not his own family's. I guess he grew up with it, but it seems he doesn't get that what his family does truly is rude (in my estimation) to the vast majority of people. You don't invite people for dinner, especially for their birthday, only to be already eating and almost finished by the time you know they will arrive.\n\nAnd it's not \"one day\" is it? It's already been on multiple occasions, and this time it would be at an event specifically to celebrate your birthday.\n\nI think his whole family, him included really, are in their own weird world where manners are different. He may never come to truly get why this is so rude to you.\n\nWhat is concerning to me is that your boyfriend has already chosen a side. He won't upset his parents by asking them to put up with anything they will find rude, but expects you to put up with what is bad manners and disrespect by most people's (dare I say normal people's) lights.\n\nETA: As for blood sugar issues, if they really have this problem then it doesn't mean they can just do whatever they please, inviting people to dinner, offering to wait for them, and so on, with no intention of actually waiting to eat with the people they invite. If they can't wait they shouldn't invite. That's the answer, not completely ignoring how their behavior affects guests. As I said earlier though, I suspect they have gone into their own weird world where this isn't even factored in in terms of manners. They have probably become collectively oblivious to it.", "So, his family invite you in and start eating without you, and that is ok for your boyfriend. But, if you ask him to stop by just for cake and now its rude? Girl, if this guy doesnt stand up for you with this little thing, imagine in the future. \n\nI'm with you. No one touch the food unless everybody is ready (exceptions for people who are super late). You were a guest! You were invited! You explained your schedules! And yet they could wait a little more? \"Sugar problems\"? There are ways to control that! Why did they keep invit you in? Did they even apologize? \n\nThis is the kind of family you wanna be part of it? You schedules are not even that crazy!! Super normal, actually! \n\nNTA. I would put my foot down.", "YTA\n\nIf you it bothers you that people don't sit around being hungry waiting on you, just don't go anymore.\n\nJust remember, when we make choices, there will be consequences, whether good or bad.\n\nDo what you suggest, and you will not be the GF much longer, which sounds like the best outcome for all involved anyway.", "NTA and honestly, that's super odd that they do that.  I'd start declining, maybe saying you think you have to work late, but Saturday would be a great day to join them for a meal.", "Fed you for free\nNo washing up\nNo cooking\nGod forbid they eat their own food in their own house.\nWe aren't in a generation where guests get more power over people in their own home.\nIt's their home their relaxing place their food their son, you don't have to go at all.", "NTA, but when they invite you, if it's a workday that you know you'll be taking the train in at 6pm, decline the invitation. \n\nIf they ask you can explain that after a long workday and commute you get in too late, and you'd prefer not to visit on those days. \n\nHave you asked your boyfriend why his family invites you to dinner when they eat at 5pm and you arrive close to 6:30pm? Do they forget you get in late?", "You always have the option to decline an invitation.", "NTA. Not waiting for you when inviting you for your birthday is inconsiderate. I would decline invitations on those days and eat before going over on days you have to commute. This situation isn't worth the aggravation. If you're eating alone at an invited dinner, you might as well eat alone at home or on your way back.", "NTA. There is so much here.\n\n>They are notorious for eating exactly at 5pm\n\nThat's not dinner.\n\n>that I can deal with everyone eating before me for one day. \n\nThis will only ever happen one more time?\n\n>my bf is pretty floored I would suggest that\n\nI'm pretty floored that he can't see the problem here.", "I wonder what that birthday dinner would look like. You gonna walk in and find them clearing their plates from the cake? And then you gonna sit alone at the table, having your birthday dinner? This is ridiculous. Absolutely NTA.

WTF is that? Your boyfriend is the issue here.

Respect goes both ways. NTA.", "NTA. What they're doing is rude. It won't be different on your birthday - you'll end up eating alone, eating food someone else wants, and you'll end up with the last slice of cake. That doesn't sound like a place anyone wants to be on their birthday.\n\nIf you arrive later will they also get a head start and open your present for you too?\n\nAs for the need to eat at set times, if it is diabetes then it doesn't sound right. I'm TD1 (for 26 years now and 10 years as a mentor to newly diagnosed teens) and if I'm eating later then usual I can adjust insulin/food earlier in the day. Contrary to popular belief diabetes doesn't mean we instantly drop dead if we delay our meals. What this sounds like is people poorly managing or not fully understanding their condition, most likely over using insulin to keep glucose levels down and then eating to try to counter the over use when their levels drop too low. Plus, if it's diabetes they shouldn't really be having cake, especially if they're struggling with maintaining control.", "NTA, of course.\n\nI'd be massively weirded out if someone invited me over to eat, only for me to arrive and find them already finishing. That's extremely rude. What I'm supposed to do in that situation, sit and eat alone?", "NTA.\n\nDo not accept dinner invitations from the. If your bf doesn't have your back, dump him.", "NTA but bf and his family are. You don\u2019t invite someone to dinner and not have dinner with them. What a strange family. And your bf wants you to defer to his family on your birthday. Do you really see yourself as part of this anal retentive family someday.

You can always say \"no\" to the invites also, though.", ">If it\u2019s really down to blood sugar levels, they can have an appitzer.\n\nThis is a really good point. As they don't have to eat the whole dinner earlier, they are either choosing to be rude or their ideas of proper manners have become warped -- which is probably the case as apparently OP just skipping dinner to come later for cake would be rude (while them eating dinner without her, leaving her at the table to eat by herself isn't).", "I agree NTA but what kind of life do you have that dinner at 5 is not dinner? I hate eating later than 6, I\u2019d prefer to eat at 5 lol"]}
