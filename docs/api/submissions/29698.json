{"id": 29698, "submission_id": "17gulfg", "title": "AITA for asking my bf\u2019s family to stop inviting me for dinner", "selftext": "My boyfriend\u2019s (29M) family recently invited me for dinner to celebrate my (28F) birthday. They are notorious for eating exactly at 5pm, but since I work in the office occasionally, and it\u2019s a one hour commute, they will sometimes offer to push dinner so we can eat after I finish commuting back to town. The last three times they have invited me to dinner however, I have arrived to find everyone already eating, most recently, everyone was clearing their plate by the time I walked through the door. For some context, my train arrives to my hometown at 6:13pm and I will be through their door by 6:20pm - if I go over after working from home, I will be there by 5:10pm at the latest. \n\nI come from a family where no one touches their food without everyone at the table and ready to eat, let alone a guest. Since I was raised this way, I find what my boyfriends family is doing completely disrespectful and it hurts my feelings that they OFFER to push dinner, and then eat without me anyways - not to mention the uncomfortableness of also having to eat alone at the table. I\u2019ve brought this up to my bf and he says it\u2019s not a big deal, and that members of his family need to eat at a certain time because of blood sugar issues - also, just to note, my bf has stopped eating before I get there since I told him it bothers me, his family has not. Recently, when they offered to have me for dinner for my birthday after an office day, I politely suggested to my bf that they eat without me and I will come after I get home for cake or something. My boyfriend said he wouldn\u2019t be suggesting that to his parents because it\u2019s rude and ungrateful, and that I can deal with everyone eating before me for one day. \n\nMy stance is pretty firm that if you invite someone for dinner, you shouldn\u2019t eat without them, so I\u2019ve asked him going forward to stop inviting me for family dinners on work/week days. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m overreacting, or over asking but my bf is pretty floored I would suggest that. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: just for clarity, on days I\u2019m in the office and am invited for dinner, they don\u2019t eat at 5. They are well aware I won\u2019t arrive back to my hometown until after 6 - his dad works in the same building as me, with different hours - so he knows the commute well and they OFFER to eat later but still start eating before I arrive just after 6, which is what I find weird and uncomfortable imo.

People are different though \u2013 I had a housemate whose mother would send her back from dinner with containers of food for me, and while I wasn't invited to family dinner there was obviously still hospitality there.\n\nBut I'd be uncomfortable too, and inviting someone for a birthday meal and eating it without them is plain weird. I think asking your BF's family to stop inviting you could be taken badly, but asking your boyfriend to respond to invites extended through him with a stock 'thanks, but she'll be late so she'd feel awkward eating by herself' seems diplomatic enough.", "NTA\n\n>My boyfriend said he wouldn\u2019t be suggesting that to his parents because it\u2019s rude and ungrateful, and that I can deal with everyone eating before me for one day. \n\nSo, your boyfriend *can* see and care about rudeness, but not his own family's. I guess he grew up with it, but it seems he doesn't get that what his family does truly is rude (in my estimation) to the vast majority of people. You don't invite people for dinner, especially for their birthday, only to be already eating and almost finished by the time you know they will arrive.\n\nAnd it's not \"one day\" is it? It's already been on multiple occasions, and this time it would be at an event specifically to celebrate your birthday.\n\nI think his whole family, him included really, are in their own weird world where manners are different. He may never come to truly get why this is so rude to you.\n\nWhat is concerning to me is that your boyfriend has already chosen a side. He won't upset his parents by asking them to put up with anything they will find rude, but expects you to put up with what is bad manners and disrespect by most people's (dare I say normal people's) lights.\n\nETA: As for blood sugar issues, if they really have this problem then it doesn't mean they can just do whatever they please, inviting people to dinner, offering to wait for them, and so on, with no intention of actually waiting to eat with the people they invite. If they can't wait they shouldn't invite. That's the answer, not completely ignoring how their behavior affects guests. As I said earlier though, I suspect they have gone into their own weird world where this isn't even factored in in terms of manners. They have probably become collectively oblivious to it.", "So, his family invite you in and start eating without you, and that is ok for your boyfriend. But, if you ask him to stop by just for cake and now its rude? Girl, if this guy doesnt stand up for you with this little thing, imagine in the future. \n\nI'm with you. No one touch the food unless everybody is ready (exceptions for people who are super late). You were a guest! You were invited! You explained your schedules!

Contrary to popular belief diabetes doesn't mean we instantly drop dead if we delay our meals. What this sounds like is people poorly managing or not fully understanding their condition, most likely over using insulin to keep glucose levels down and then eating to try to counter the over use when their levels drop too low. Plus, if it's diabetes they shouldn't really be having cake, especially if they're struggling with maintaining control.", "NTA, of course.\n\nI'd be massively weirded out if someone invited me over to eat, only for me to arrive and find them already finishing.

You consider it a group experience, where the interaction with the family is important. But they are treating it as a gesture of offering you a meal, regardless of when you show up. It really doesn't sound like they're malicious - you said they have medical needs and generally have a really strict eating time. I think you are interpreting what they do as rude because of your expectation and this is causing you to resent them, when it really doesn't sound like they're trying to hurt you.

What I don't find reasonable is them planning these dinners on days when they know you can't make it and then leaving you to eat alone. At bare minimum, they could sit at the table with you with a coffee or something and chat with you while you eat. I am the complete opposite of my family and tend to eat late dinners, whereas my dad is consistent with his 5:30 dinner time because of his diabetes. You can set your watch by it.

You can very easily have a polite and enthusiastic conversation with them and say, \"oh that's so sweet y'all want to do that for me! And I would absolutely love to. But I know y'all have to eat at 5 and I would be so terribly late. What if we just do cake and coffee once I get here, that way y'all don't feel like you would need to wait for me? I would love to celebrate with y'all but feel awful asking you to wait to eat until I get there. I wish my scheduled allowed for me to get here so I could eat with everyone. Maybe we can try a weekend dinner sometime so my work schedule doesn't stop me from being able to get here on time to enjoy y'all's company over a full meal!\" Be super happy, polite, and get excited at the idea of sitting down to eat with them.

If they wanted to invite her over to eat food they prepared for her but not specifically eat with them, then say, \u201cHey OP, I know you get out late but I made some (whatever dish they made) that I was wondering if you\u2019d like to come over and try. I know it\u2019s your birthday so I don\u2019t want you to have to bother cooking for yourself, and we can all hang out after!\u201d \nBut honestly, even then, I think it\u2019s kind of an AH move to invite someone over to have a meal and then have everyone eat before they got there. Some ppl have weird traditions sure but this is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard of that one. Not even stay at the table while she eats? Just leave her to sit alone? And they want to do that to her on her birthday????\nAnd then to have her bf ignore what OP said they want on THEIR birthday and instead make it about his families\u2019 feelings? This whole family seems rude and this seems intentional, especially since she has voiced her annoyance only for it to continue.", ">and that I can deal with everyone eating before me for one day.\n\nThis line made me go WTF??? Basically the bf (so they aren't in-laws) is saying that for OP's birthday they get NO consideration. Wow.", "NTA. 'Blood sugar' issues mean you eat an apple or a cookie at 5 pm and then eat with the PERSON YOU ASKED TO DINNER when they get there an hour or so later.\n\nWTF? And her BF says she's being rude and ungrateful by saying no to birthday dinner but will bring a cake to share later? BF doesn't sound like a keeper to me.", "I would turn around and leave.", "Many people with younger kids too, if they want to eat with them", "\u201cEating early is actually better for you\u201d.\n\nDo you have a source for that?", "She said that the last time she arrived, plates were being cleared.  Before that, people were still eating.  She could just join them at the table.  She didn't say that no one stays at the table while she is eating.", "Imagine telling someone you'd host their birthday dinner, which starts at the exact same time the birthday girl finishes work. Knowing full well everyone else will eat at 5, and the birthday girl will have to eat by herself when she arrives post-commute.\n\nLike if the family HAS to eat at that time, then it's kinder not to invite her. Offer to celebrate over the weekend, so she can arrive with everyone else and you can eat with all your guests.", "Hey, OP, thanks for being super mature and responding like this! I agree with the other comment that they want to make sure you know you're welcome to eat in their home and this is more of a familial difference than anything else. It's nice when the OP is willing to listen to some of the more rational comments in this forum.", "Maybe not an hill to die on but its very rude to invite someone to dinner and then eat before the guests arrive. Customs or not. Atleast in most european countries its a big no no what your bf family is doing.\n\nI personally wouldnt be going to that kind of treatment on a weekday after working all day. I would just go home and do something comftable for myself but thats only what i would do.", "Not quite. What she's doing is asking him to ask them to change *their* behavior. But the only behavior she has control over is her own, and boundaries are about taking control of yourself \u2014 not others.", "He understands, he's just being an AH.", "Right??? Put out a bowl of nuts, a few slices of cheese to nosh on while waiting. This is truly bizarre... to invite someone to dinner and start without them is so crazily rude. \n\nOP's offered a solution, since they can't seem to wait 20 minutes for her.  Invite her on weekends. BF won't advocate for her with his parents. You're right, he's the problem here. His parents, his place to talk to them. The fact that he won't is a giant red flag.", "Tbf it's not always easy to just snack away when your body is regulated to digest at a certain time. I'm T1D and have to eat before 7 or I'll crash multiple times. That being said when I invite someone over and it's after 7 I will have a half dinner then the other half when they are ready to eat.", "Especially more than once! And ostensibly as a celebration for you! After work! Just like... I don't want to fight, I'm just out.", "I guess that depends on your bed time. I usually go to bed at midnight, so if supper was at 5pm I'd be craving late night snacks.", "Yes:\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/10/06/when-to-eat-dinner-earlier-healthier/8187644001/\n\nIt also helps prevent things like acid reflux, source: my nutritionist", "Not the way I want to spend my birthday dinner, though!", "I imagine if they\u2019re clearing their plates they most likely didn\u2019t stay at the table with her, and I also would assume she\u2019d mention it if they did. Although, even if they did stay, that does not negate the fact that they\u2019ve continuously done this after she\u2019s tried to ask them to stop. And they almost 100% will do it to her on her own birthday too. So, regardless, they\u2019re being rude.", "Well, then, maybe she should find a new bf.", "Not at all weird in the Midwest where I'm from if the people you're inviting are family and it's a recurring invitation. You just eat when you get there / when the food is done and chill and talk. Someone shows up an hour later, they grab a plate and join the conversation.

Their rules.", "Yes, as I said, only the people with the genuine medical need should eat first.", "In my family we would go ahead and eat if people were more than about 15 minutes late. My parents\u2019 thought process was that it\u2019s extremely rude to be late when you know someone is making food to be ready at a certain time and you don\u2019t get to force everyone to eat cold food because you can\u2019t be on time. I think this was primarily because I had an aunt with a lateness problem who would regularly arrive about an hour late and my mother got sick of it. Personally, I think it\u2019s fine to do that. \n\nThat\u2019s not what is happening here, though.

Where did OP mention eating in the kitchen?", "He changed his eating habits just for her when she asked so clearly he does care about her and value What makes her happy even if it's not what he is used to or grew up with.  OP is making out like what she And her family do is the right way to do it and then what her boyfriend and his family do is somehow wrong and maybe that's where the push back is coming from on his part. A. does seem like why would she need him to tell her his parents not to invite her when she could just decline the invitation and if she wants them to go ahead and have dinner without her then what is the problem that's exactly what's already going on isn't it. Just keep things as they are if that's what she really wants", "> I\u2019ve asked him going forward to stop inviting me for family dinners on work/week days.

It\u2019s not like she\u2019s showing up late after saying she\u2019d be there at 5. Its absolutely ridiculous. Don\u2019t invite someone for dinner if you don\u2019t plan to wait for them to arrive before you eat. It\u2019s common courtesy.

That probably wouldn't be the case if they hadn't delayed dinner at least somewhat.\n\nMore communication needed but still, it's not that big of a deal to just grab a plate when you get there and join the party.
