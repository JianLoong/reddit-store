Being a nurse is more often than not, soul crushing work. No one can understand it, but another nurse. Our social batteries are used up, and often in the negative after a shift.  So when I have a day off, I don't want any interaction with anyone, even my husband (who is my soul mate and the love of my life). My husband and I have a large house, and he even has his own office, but the thought of someone in the house feels intrusive to me. And you know what he does? He goes into the office on my day off, because he knows I need to decompress. He has no issues with it, because he knows how draining and soul sucking my job is.

That way you have an office for when you're working from home and she still has the rest of the place to relax in.  Even if you're wearing headphones and not making noise, she just wants to relax and unwind after a 12-hour shift, and it sounds like she doesn't feel comfortable doing that with you working.  Plus, we all need our alone time.", "NAH. My partner and I were in a similar situation and a 1-bedroom apartment is a really small space to share when one person is WFH. I completely understand where you're coming from - it's infuriating to work from the office for no apparent benefit (plus added commute etc) when you can work more comfortably and efficiently from home. But I've also been on the other side, and it feels like you need to tiptoe around the person that's working when you're  not. And nursing is an exhausting job.\n\nCould you compromise for the next six months until you move into a bigger place? Something like not working from home on her first day coming off shift? It seems like there shouldn't be a huge overlap between the days you're able to work from home and the days she has off if you're both working full-time hours. You could also look at it as at least on those days you're deriving some benefit from being in the office (happier girlfriend who will know that you're doing it for her). A lot of people who have been forced back can't say that.\n\n(FYI: unless you make the second bedroom of the new place an office that you stay in during the work day, in my experience this will likely still be an issue. A two-bedroom apartment doesn't really feel much bigger than a one-bedroom if the additional room isn't used during the course of a normal day.)", "NAH but personally I\u2019d be thrilled if my partner and I could both wfh all the time.

I can not be with others all day. I need this for my mental health. The problem is that working from home is very much intruding on her needs, while meeting yours.

That being said, i did read that you don\u2019t always work from home on her days off, so she does get alone time, just not as much as she used too . She needs to get used to the idea of you being home more, especially if you plan on moving somewhere bigger because it\u2019s not you specifically,  it\u2019s probably just the presence of another person that bothers her.\nIf either of you want this relationship to last, you both need to adapt.

It was a big adjustment going from zero people in the house on my 2 weekdays (or more of I had to work over the weekend) off, to having him at home.

Some one could do Wednesday and then Friday Saturday be off Sunday and work 3 in a row. Or work Monday but off Tuesday and then Wednesday and Thursday. Which honestly makes me cherish my time off even more and I do get annoyed when my plan to relax is ruined because it\u2019s literally my one day off in between. Especially if it\u2019s nightshift", "If you can\u2019t stand being at home with your partner then that to me is a red flag on the relationship. It\u2019s still her safe space with OP there.", "Then find another home.", "Its her home. She pays half too..she shouldnt HAVE to leave HER HOME to have peace and quiet.

She has every right to want a day at home alone when hes at work..\nNothing unhealthy about it. \n\nThis isnt about you and your clearly heavily emotionally enmeshed relationship with your marital SO..\n\nIts about OP and his gf. Mmkay???", "I'm guessing you're either a real extrovert or you didn't live with a partner during COVID. It's definitely not a red flag to be a nurse and want a bit of solitude to unwind.", "It his home. He pays half too\u2026he shouldn\u2019t HAVE to leave HIS HOME for her to have peace and quiet. \n\nOr do only her needs matter? Apparently from your view OP doesn\u2019t matter."]}
