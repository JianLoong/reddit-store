I knew it makes me a bad person, and I was honest with my husband about it, but when they switched to wfh it sucked. And he\u2019s still only in 2 days a week now. On my days off, after intense patient care fatigue, I don\u2019t want him there some days. Wfh for him means occasional phone calls with him watching tv, being bored and wanting to talk (I just talked for 12 hrs straight\u2026with and n95, leave me alone) and wanting to do it during the day more, I just want some alone time!

Why can't you work from home part of the week and go to the office for the other part? Whoever refuses to compromise is the asshole.", "YTA. I'm an RN and need my quiet time when I'm off. Being a nurse is more often than not, soul crushing work. No one can understand it, but another nurse. Our social batteries are used up, and often in the negative after a shift.  So when I have a day off, I don't want any interaction with anyone, even my husband (who is my soul mate and the love of my life). My husband and I have a large house, and he even has his own office, but the thought of someone in the house feels intrusive to me. And you know what he does? He goes into the office on my day off, because he knows I need to decompress. He has no issues with it, because he knows how draining and soul sucking my job is. I'm sure you love your GF, but please consider what I'm saying to you. Give her some space and quiet time.", "I'm going with a very soft YTA because you told her it is ridiculous to feel the way she does. Belittling her opinions and feelings is problematic.\n\nShe works in a high stress environment and needs time to decompress without anyone around. You need to find a compromise until you're in a larger place. Considering that's just six months away limit your WFH days to when she is working.", "NAH - maybe it's time for you guys to upgrade to a 2-bedroom apartment.  That way you have an office for when you're working from home and she still has the rest of the place to relax in.  Even if you're wearing headphones and not making noise, she just wants to relax and unwind after a 12-hour shift, and it sounds like she doesn't feel comfortable doing that with you working.  Plus, we all need our alone time.", "NAH. My partner and I were in a similar situation and a 1-bedroom apartment is a really small space to share when one person is WFH. I completely understand where you're coming from - it's infuriating to work from the office for no apparent benefit (plus added commute etc) when you can work more comfortably and efficiently from home. But I've also been on the other side, and it feels like you need to tiptoe around the person that's working when you're  not. And nursing is an exhausting job.\n\nCould you compromise for the next six months until you move into a bigger place? Something like not working from home on her first day coming off shift? It seems like there shouldn't be a huge overlap between the days you're able to work from home and the days she has off if you're both working full-time hours. You could also look at it as at least on those days you're deriving some benefit from being in the office (happier girlfriend who will know that you're doing it for her). A lot of people who have been forced back can't say that.\n\n(FYI: unless you make the second bedroom of the new place an office that you stay in during the work day, in my experience this will likely still be an issue. A two-bedroom apartment doesn't really feel much bigger than a one-bedroom if the additional room isn't used during the course of a normal day.)", "NAH but personally I\u2019d be thrilled if my partner and I could both wfh all the time. I\u2019m obviously perfectly fine when he goes in and vice versa, but it\u2019s so much easier to coordinate schedules when we\u2019re both home.", "NAH i need alone time. I can not be with others all day. I need this for my mental health. The problem is that working from home is very much intruding on her needs, while meeting yours. The fact that you feel her needs are ridiculous is a problem.  You both have very valid points and you need some sort of compromise.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s your apartment too. That being said, i understand what she means about alone time. I am not a nurse or in the medical field, but even i need time by myself, i need it to decompress and take care of my mental health and that\u2019s with a job nowhere near as stressful as hers.\n\nYou\u2019re perfectly entitled to want to work from home and she\u2019s perfectly entitled to want alone time. That being said, i did read that you don\u2019t always work from home on her days off, so she does get alone time, just not as much as she used too . She needs to get used to the idea of you being home more, especially if you plan on moving somewhere bigger because it\u2019s not you specifically,  it\u2019s probably just the presence of another person that bothers her.\nIf either of you want this relationship to last, you both need to adapt. Make sure your next place has an office space for you.", "NTA. My husband and I lived in a one bedroom apt and we both worked from home. We made it work", "NTA, it's your place as much as it is hers.

You have equal right to that space.  If she's doing 12s as a nurse then she has 4 days off a week.

It was a big adjustment going from zero people in the house on my 2 weekdays (or more of I had to work over the weekend) off, to having him at home. I never made a big deal about it, but it was a little unsettling to have him around all day, albeit working, when I was used to having the house completely to myself until the kids got home at 3:30 or so.\n\nNAH. Have a frank discussion and work it out.", "NTA. Stress isn\u2019t a competition.

Keep the tv off? Can she listen to her music on her day off? Obviously you have plenty of alone time so it may not seem like a big deal. Dealing with sick people and doctors all day is stressful.
