Being a nurse is more often than not, soul crushing work. No one can understand it, but another nurse. Our social batteries are used up, and often in the negative after a shift.  So when I have a day off, I don't want any interaction with anyone, even my husband (who is my soul mate and the love of my life). My husband and I have a large house, and he even has his own office, but the thought of someone in the house feels intrusive to me. And you know what he does? He goes into the office on my day off, because he knows I need to decompress. He has no issues with it, because he knows how draining and soul sucking my job is.

That way you have an office for when you're working from home and she still has the rest of the place to relax in.  Even if you're wearing headphones and not making noise, she just wants to relax and unwind after a 12-hour shift, and it sounds like she doesn't feel comfortable doing that with you working.  Plus, we all need our alone time.", "NAH. My partner and I were in a similar situation and a 1-bedroom apartment is a really small space to share when one person is WFH. I completely understand where you're coming from - it's infuriating to work from the office for no apparent benefit (plus added commute etc) when you can work more comfortably and efficiently from home. But I've also been on the other side, and it feels like you need to tiptoe around the person that's working when you're  not. And nursing is an exhausting job.\n\nCould you compromise for the next six months until you move into a bigger place? Something like not working from home on her first day coming off shift? It seems like there shouldn't be a huge overlap between the days you're able to work from home and the days she has off if you're both working full-time hours. You could also look at it as at least on those days you're deriving some benefit from being in the office (happier girlfriend who will know that you're doing it for her). A lot of people who have been forced back can't say that.\n\n(FYI: unless you make the second bedroom of the new place an office that you stay in during the work day, in my experience this will likely still be an issue. A two-bedroom apartment doesn't really feel much bigger than a one-bedroom if the additional room isn't used during the course of a normal day.)", "NAH but personally I\u2019d be thrilled if my partner and I could both wfh all the time.

I can not be with others all day. I need this for my mental health. The problem is that working from home is very much intruding on her needs, while meeting yours.

That being said, i did read that you don\u2019t always work from home on her days off, so she does get alone time, just not as much as she used too . She needs to get used to the idea of you being home more, especially if you plan on moving somewhere bigger because it\u2019s not you specifically,  it\u2019s probably just the presence of another person that bothers her.\nIf either of you want this relationship to last, you both need to adapt.

You have equal right to that space.  If she's doing 12s as a nurse then she has 4 days off a week.

It was a big adjustment going from zero people in the house on my 2 weekdays (or more of I had to work over the weekend) off, to having him at home.

You\u2019re working. I get that she works 12 hours and wants space, but since she\u2019s the one with the issue, she\u2019s the one that needs to find a different space.

That trumps her alone time.", "NAH but honestly, along with what everyone's said, it may also be a domestic work issue. I know that, for me, even if me and my partner are having what he calls a lazy weekend, if he's around, I will usually pick up and tidy and make dinner. So not really a lazy weekend for me. When he's not home and I am, however, I feel more comfortable just lazing around a bit. I can look like a slob, and it's all cool.

Perhaps a bigger apartment when your lease is over would be in order. \nThat being said, when I was married my husband worked from home. He was in calls a lot and I had to keep the toddler quiet and also be quiet myself. It was really annoying. But it doesn\u2019t seem like quiet is an issue.

She probably wants to sleep in, play music, take a leisurely shit, binge watch shitty TV etc, and feels like she can't do any of that while he's working from home. Presumably she'd spend most of her time in the living room, and she knows her day off activities will encroach on a work environment for him, so she has to alter her behaviour. It is kind of crummy to impose a work environment on what is supposed to be a common lounge environment, but I don't think you're an ah for wanting to work from home.\n\nYou need an office space, but in the meantime I'd try compromising and choosing to work from the office on at least some of her days off.", "It doesn't make you a bad person, I just  needed to say that", "Can I also ask, would it be a reasonable response to ask her to go out sometimes to get away from him if he is wfh rather than it always being him leaving?

Could be that OP keeps talking to her, or asking her to do stuff?", "I respect the work she does. But telling me, someone who pays for 50% of the apartment, that I can\u2019t be at my apartment? Ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019m going to start saying on her days off she needs to be out of the apartment. Doesn\u2019t that sound ridiculous to you?", "Some people just  need alone time, it doesnt have to be an insult to OP.", "I think there\u2019s more to the story than OP is letting on.

But since you clearly have a choice and know that she wants some time alone, you should be considerate and try to work in the office on the days she has off and work from home when she's working.

Hypocrites", "I think I am in the very lucky minority \u2014 my BF and I absolutely love when the other one is home. We each get solo time in the house, but we both prefer the other to be here. We have more than enough space in our house for us to each have an office on separate sides of the house, but we opted to share an office and are like 2 feet from one another on our WFH days. We were in another city the other week, and in a 50k square foot mostly empty wework space, decided to share a table. \n\nI\u2019m glad to know how fortunate I am.", "So why didn't you go do something alone?

And we joke about it and he does. But there was still a shock at first of how different it was.", "No. Probably not. What would you even suggest?", "It still changes her sense of  personal freedom at home during her time off. I love my husband and enjoy the days he has off but I wouldnt want him home all the time. I also try to get out when he has time off so he can feel that same sense of relaxation and privacy in the home.", "No I get that. But to the extent that I was understanding it as, it doesn't make sense. Wanting alone time is one thing, being pissed about their work situation and them being home though, that just....idk...that's not normal, and like I said, seems to defeat the purpose of living with someone. Having your own space to do things in and do alone time isn't the same as just not wanting your partner at home at all on your days off. There's something deeper going on. Maybe my own perspective is reading too much into, or there's something being left out and I'm just missing it. I'm willing to be wrong, but I trust my instincts too.", "maybe he can try something like parsec as well, if at times it is necessary to work from a coffee shop. That way you can still remotely work on your desktop, granted you have internet access.", "Definitely NAH - I love wfh and would be upset if I couldn't do it, but I definitely wouldn't blame somebody for being upset at never being alone, especially if they're used to getting some alone time. \n\nSome compromise is needed here until you get a better place, but it really depends on how many times this overlaps. If she only has one or two days off during the work week, you shouldn't WFH on those days. If she works nights and is home during the day during your work week, you should be able to WFH for half the time or something, as it is more comfortable for you and then she would still get some time alone.", "Yeah, I do. You don\u2019t know the kind of video editing I do. I do custom GFX work and 3D modeling that requires a lot of power.

If the gender roles were reversed folks would be losing their minds of him being a AH.
