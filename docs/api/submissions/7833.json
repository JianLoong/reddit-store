My MIL caught wind of this and I guess wanted to pitch in and help to so she offered to get the birthday cake.\n\nShe asked my husband what kind I like and he told her anything chocolate or tiramisu. He also told her that I hate fruity cakes (lemon, raspberry etc).\n\nEvening of my birthday rolls around and everything is going smoothly until it's time for cake.\n\nMy MIL and my mom both went into the kitchen, MIL was unboxing the cake and my mom was grabbing plates and utensils.\n\nApperently my mom took a glance at the cake and asked if this cake was for me? My MIL was like yes obviously.\n\nMy mom was like \"oh no, I guess no one informed you that \\*my name\\* doesn't like fruity cakes, her favorites are anything chocolate and tiramisu.\"\n\nMy MIL was like \"no they informed me of her preference. I just saw this cake at the store and thought it looked lovely. Plus it would be nice for \\*my name\\* to try something different\".\n\nMy mom left left the kitchen because she didn't want to make a scene on my birthday.\n\nMIL brought the cake out and my husband immediately confronted her when he saw it and was like \"mom is this cake for \\*my name\\*?\" she was like \"yes I thought it would be nice for us to try something different\".\n\nAnyway i'm an adult and it's just a cake, I wasn't about to make some huge scene about a cake so the cake was cut and MIL offered me a slice and I just politely declined and ate some of the other desserts at the table (fruit, chocolate covered strawberries etc).\n\nShe immediately got offended and said she finds it extremely insulting that I am not eating any of the cake that she specifically bought for me on my birthday.\n\nI just simply told her \"well I appreciate you getting the cake, but my husband and I made it clear that I do not like fruity cakes and you knew this\".\n\nShe said I was being extremely disrespectful and selfish and stormed out with my FIL. She's been contacting both my husband and I saying how I need to apologize for my behavior.\n\nWe've also been getting shit from my SIL's and I kind of feel bad now for not just eating the cake.

Ultimate petty....Make a very very public apology. Next family event...Ting Ting Ting knife on glass like you are making a toast...Sorry to disturb your evening/afternoon... Mother in law has demanded I apologise so here it is . I am sorry that when you deliberately brought a cake you knew and had been told I would hate to my birthday that deciding to not trying to force myself to gag it down trying not to vomit wasn't good enough. I am sorry that my polite cutting of the cake and not making a fuss at your deliberate obnoxious power play but politely declining a piece was not good enough for you. I am so sorry that I didn't give into your tantrum about the fact that I had politely declined the cake you knew I hated..I am sorry you don't understand that respect is earned and you don't get respect for deliberately trying to create and issue..........I WILL BE SURE TO ONLY SERVE YOU THINGS YOU DON'T LIKE IN FUTURE AS  \"IT WILL BE NICE FOR YOU TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT\" To my mother in law my deepest apologies  ......  is there anything else you need me to apologise for?", "NTA! It was a power play on her part and it failed.", "NTA - your MIL did this willfully and maliciously.  I think you handled it perfectly by declining the cake you don't like and eating things you did.   I've made it perfectly clear that I don't like cooked fruit (so I'm with you on the fruity cakes) and I would have done the exact same thing.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to eat anything, let alone something you don\u2019t like. Tell them to stop  trying to police what you eat.", "NTA\n\n\nShe purposely got you something she knew you didn't like for your birthday and somehow you're the disrespectful one for not eating it?! \n\n\nHahahahahahahahahahahaha sorry, your MIL sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA  She thought she was gonna punish you by getting a cake she knew you wouldn't like.

And do not apologize!!!", "NTA\n\nyou handled that perfectly. you blocked her power move.", "NTA MIL set up this drama 100%", "NTA - you know what she is doing. Time for a social snipping.", "NTA.  Your SILs have been socialized to believe that Mom gets to decide what other people do.  From their perspective, Mom set a test for you and you failed it.\n\nActually you passed, and well done.", "NTA It's almost like MIL did this on purpose....Ya did good anyway and declined politely. Honestly I'd have been pissed and would have called her out more abruptly.", "NTA she was literally trying to force you to eat something she was told you wouldn\u2019t like and is now causing drama over it. I do find it funny that you refused to eat the fruity cake and instead ate fruit in a variety of other ways. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Do not apologize to your bully. She specifically chose to be pretty in your birthday. It is refreshing though that your husband had your back without any prompting. She should be apologizing to you.  Until she does she should not be invited to your home again.", "NTA.\n\nYour MIL was trying to start shit.  As you said she doesn't like you, she specifically offered to make the cake and then intentionally made something you don't like.\n\nYou are never an AH for declining to eat something.  Doesn't matter who made it or why.  You wouldn't owe her an apology even if it wasn't your birthday and she hadn't been told of your preferences.", "NTA- Is this fake? Because this is a no brainer requiring little to no common sense. The fact she said you should try something new just tells me you need to take her something to eat that she knows you hate because you know she needs to try it again.", "NTA - the MIL was made aware of your preferences and intentionally chose something she knew you wouldn't like in order to get a reaction.

Good thing your mom & husband knew this and backed you up.", "NTA. The only thing disrespectful was MIL intentionally buying something she knew you didn't like and creating drama for her own self gain. Let her play the victim all she wants. Glad to hear your husband called her out on it.", "NTA. This was a set up. And since you didn't take the bait, she's upping the ante in trying to get a rise out of you. Don't give her the satisfaction or she'll learn she can get attention from these behaviors. The only way to win at her game is to refuse to play.", "NTA.

You weren't rude about it. You were very polite and enjoyed everyone enjoying the cake. Your MIL doesn't get to dictate when grown adults try something new. You're not a child and that's exactly how she was treating you. Don't feel bad. You did absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA. For all you know she poisoned the cake too.\n\n>My MIL is very old school and does not think this it right\n\nThat's interesting considering her behavior during this incident. She certainly didn't comport herself in an \"old school\" manner.\n\n>My mom and grandma insisted on bringing/cooking all my favorite foods for the dinner. My MIL caught wind of this and I guess wanted to pitch in and help to so she offered to get the birthday cake.\n>\n>She asked my husband what kind I like and he told her anything chocolate or tiramisu.

But I thought she was \"old school\"? Surely if she were \"old school\" then she would have been in the kitchen for hours carefully crafting a cake for you, and moreover a cake that she would have been sure that you would enjoy, because if she were really invested in being \"old school\" then she would not wish to cause a scene at your birthday.\n\n>My mom was like \"oh no, I guess no one informed you that *my name* doesn't like fruity cakes, her favorites are anything chocolate and tiramisu.\"\n>\n>My MIL was like \"no they informed me of her preference. I just saw this cake at the store and thought it looked lovely.\n\nIf she thought the cake lovely then she should have bought it for *herself*.\n\n>Plus it would be nice for *my name* to try something different\".\n\nBut it wasn't nice because you didn't want to try something different.\n\n>Anyway i'm an adult and it's just a cake, I wasn't about to make some huge scene about a cake so the cake was cut and MIL offered me a slice and I just politely declined and ate some of the other desserts at the table (fruit, chocolate covered strawberries etc).\n\nYou handled it in the most polite way you could. Far more politely than your MIL's behavior warranted and she should have realized that.\n\n>She immediately got offended\n\nAbout what? She bought you a cake she knew you wouldn't like, and then you didn't eat it. She should not have been surprised by that.\n\n>She said I was being extremely disrespectful and selfish and stormed out with my FIL.\n\nProjection. She disrespected you by getting you a cake she knew you wouldn't like. It occurs to me that perhaps she wanted this to happen, an opportunity to present herself as the victim and make your birthday all about her. How selfish of her.\n\n>She's been contacting both my husband and I saying how I need to apologize for my behavior.\n\nYou don't \"need\" to apologize. What a fatuous thing for her to say. You of course *may* apologize. I don't think you should, if anything I think she should apologize to you for attempting to ruin your birthday.\n\n>We've also been getting shit from my SIL's\n\nIgnore her.\n\n>and I kind of feel bad now for not just eating the cake\n\nYes, but what if it had been poisoned?", "It looks like your MIL took a trip from her house to Passive Aggressivia, CrazyTown to the grocery store then to your house. \n\nListen your family dynamics are NONE of her business. If you and your husband are comfortable with your arrangement that's all that matters. She needs to butt her traditional ass out of your marriage and let you and your husband be happy. \n\nSince she purposefully purchased the wrong cake(even if it was an accident) you're an adult, you know what you like there's no reason for you to eat something you don't like. \n\nNTA \n\nHappy Belated Birthday", "NTA.
