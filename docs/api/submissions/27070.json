We live with our mom (F46) only and our dad isn't really present in our lifes. My sister dropped off university after giving birth to a baby (M4) when she was 20, and since that she hasn't even looked for a job. For more context, my mom is the one that spends taking care of my nephew most of the time since Diana is always feeling \"tired\" and \"depressed\", I also take care of him while I can. However, Diana isn't really tired and she's just irresponsible, for example, she likes partying, going out with her friends and boyfriend (and baby daddy, that also does not take responsability for my nephew), or just stay in her room all day and do nothing more than eat or watch her phone.\n\nThese days we have been in a very bad financial situation and that made me look for a part-time job to help my mom with the bills, I also study so I only work in the afternoon until like 7:00 PM. It's still tiring since I have to do homework in the night, meaning that I go to sleep like at 11-12 PM. Diana, on the other side and despite knowing our situation didn't even look for a part-time job and I have to say that Diana uses an excesive amount of water, light and wifi. Even if I have told her to turn off the lights she isn't using, she also uses a lot of wifi.\n\nThis has been bothering me a lot, and I have been getting super annoyed. Yesterday i was doing my homework at like 9 PM Diana comes and tells me that she'll go out and that she will leave my nephew on my care (no, she didn't ask me first, she just told me that I will take care of him). I refused and told her no, that I was busy and cannot take care of him. Even of my refusal, Diana ignored me and the last thing I heard from her was when she slammed the door and went outside. Fine, I took care of my nephew because I was not going to leave a 4 years old toddler without supervision (My mom is doing night shifts, so I was the only one that could take care of him) and it was Saturday, so I had the whole Sunday to end my homework.\n\nBut today I was already pissed off and i've had enough of her bs, I approached Diana and told her to put her sht together and that I am not going to keep taking care of her son. I yelled at her that she should start doing something with her life instead of just fooling around and being completly useless. I didn't wait for her response and just went to lock myself in my room.  We haven't spoken since and she is giving me the silent treatment, i couldn't care less to be honest but i think that maybe i was too harsh.\n\ni know yelling wasn't a good option, but sincerely i want her to act like the freaking adult she is already.

That might be the best you can hope for. You can't fix someone else, even if they just have minor problems. And she's a train wreck. Take care of yourself.", "NTA. You're not the one who had a baby, it shouldn't ruin your life.", "NTA. But good Lord. That's some messed up woman. The fact that she just delivered a baby and doesn't even bother to take care of him or bother to support the household at all is some kind of entitlement. \n\n\nGive her an ultimatum that she won't get any money for her party or food from now on and she needs to work to pay for that. Not only that she will be kicked out of the house and you will cut all of her clothes if she doesn't pay some basic rent. That way she might just start working for just those things and that's a bit of money saved. I mean not you but your mother needs to say this. Discuss with your mom how you feel about all this and that you want your mom to place some hard boundaries. \n\nI know technically you or your mom aren't really responsible for the baby but since it's a kid I'm suggesting this. I don't know how the laws really work there but if it's possible maybe your mom can take the primary custody of the nephew and kick your sister out. It's not like she's adding even $1 to the household and if anything is just massively using resources for not just Wifi and Electricity but also money spent on her clothes and food and party as well.", "NTA but I'd call cops to mention that she abandoned her child with you, you didn't consent to babysitting and honestly the child deserve better than her.", "NTA at 16 you are more ahead in life than your sister. She\u2019s childish and selfish.", "My mom is as frustrated as me. But she believes that a parent should support their child no matter what. And my mom loves her grandson, she fears that if she kicks my sister out my nephew will live in a worse situation because my sister doesn't even pay attention to her son, tbh.", "Great suggestion, thank you! I love my nephew and I will investigate further to see if my mom can take custody of him.", "Cut all her clothes if she doesn't pay rent? Are you suggesting she destroy property?   \nYou do realize OP is 16 years old and doesn't have the power to do most of these things, right?", "NTA. Your Mom should at least be claiming your nephew on her taxes and hopefully, someone is getting financial support such as food stamps, fuel assistance to help. Hate to tell you this but your sister is going to have another kid at some point because she obv is irresponsible and that\u2019s how she got the first one. If your Mom doesn\u2019t wake up, she is going to get stuck raising another because she\u2019s an emotional hostage here. Not much you can do at 16 but you\u2019d both be better off if she did ask your sister to leave with the baby daddy before that happens and not form ties with the next baby. The exact same thing happened in my family when I was your age. It really sucked for my parents. Sister went on to have 3 more kids, none of which I have a relationship with for fear of being stuck like my mother was. Wishing your family the best of luck. (Also, once you get law involved, you risk kids going into foster care so be careful there).", "There's always the option of your mother adopting him if your sister agrees to that and then kicking the sister out.   \nWould you be comfortable telling your mother that you're getting your own life together and won't be a part of your sister's drama? At 16 it's a great time to concentrate on your own future.", ">But she believes that a parent should support their child no matter what. \n\nShe doesn't support **you** like she should. You're a minor, you need time for school and to be a teenager. Part-time job? Great, but not to sponsor your sister's partying (because I suspect she gets money from your mother, and you're giving money to your mother, so...). \n\nNTA, OP. Your sister is big T A, and your mother is misguided enabler.", "If you're comfortable, I also suggest showing your mother this reddit.   \nYou might also consider quitting your job or not contributing anymore. You should be putting that money into savings/investments that go towards your future. Your mother needs help with the bills because she has a 24 year old that's leeching off her 16 year old. She absolutely needs to think of the damage it's doing to you.   \nIf she can't afford to do this without forcing her 16 year old daughter to get a job she absolutely has to stop. It would be one thing if it was just you and your mother and you still had trouble paying bills- but that's not the case.", "I didn't mean for her to do it mostly for her mom to basically tell the older sister what can really happen if they lose their patience. Sometimes threats are important for folks like OP's sister to snap them out of the privilege they are provided and how if everyone else also starts acting like them the consequences will be far worse.", ">There's always the option of your mother adopting him if your sister agrees to that \n\nMaybe. But I doubt my sister would actually want my mom to adopt him since Diana knows very well that the reason mom hasn't kicked her out it's because of the toddler.\n\n>Would you be comfortable telling your mother that you're getting your own life together and won't be a part of your sister's drama? At 16 it's a great time to concentrate on your own future.\n\nI technically can, but I'm recluctant since now my mother will have to deal with the mess all alone and she already has a enough to do.", "Support comes in different forms, and enabling is not one of them.  Teaching her to stand on her own two feet and take responsibility for herself and life which includes a defenseless child.  Sometimes tough love is best", "Yes, it seems as if OP\u2019s mom\u2019s interpretation of \u201csupporting a child no matter what\u201d means supporting the one stuck in bad cycles to allow her to continue them, at both the cost of her younger child and to allow her older daughter to disregard her own responsibility to support her son. If supporting her older daughter destroys her daughter\u2019s motivation for caring for her own child appropriately, this plan is not working.", "I think I misunderstood what you meant by cut her clothes. At first I thought you were suggesting she take scissors to them...", "Remember that you are the child in this situation, and you aren't responsible for your mother's wellbeing-- she's responsible for yours. Do what's right for you, and if your mom needs more help then she can turn to her adult support system; at 16 your life is busy and full and you shouldn't have to be taking care of your mother, or your sister or your nephew.", "It might be hard to see, but your mother is causing this mess along with your sister.", "These are great options, so you should consider them. Unfortunately, it appears that your sister is banking on the fact that you and your mom will continue to take care of her and her kid(s), so why should she be responsible and do it herself? She can find the time and energy to get pregnant AGAIN, then use the same energy to care for her child and get a job. Stop enabling her bad behavior/habits.", "NTA\n\nNext time text Diana that you told her that you would not be caring for her son. Then call the police. Tell them that Diana abandoned her 4 year old without a caretaker.\n\nFrankly, your mother is enabling this. And it's not going to change.\n\nMake your plans to leave when you're 18 and have graduated high school.\n\nDo not be guilted by your mother into staying and helping out. Remind her that if she hadn't let Diana leech for all these years, she wouldn't be in this position. And that Diana is 26 years old (based on your ages now) and can support the household and her own child.", "If she\u2019s not speaking to you then she can\u2019t ask you to watch her kid.  Well done.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nShe's an irresponsible woman with a child of her own. She should've known what she got into from the moment she kept the baby. She should be aware that she must provide and take care of that child, not you or your mother. She's trying to get her youth back when she's the one throwing it away.", "Most internet routers allow you to ban specific Mac addresses. Find out what your sister's device is and ban it. Then she won't be able to sit in her room surfing the 'net.", "NTA at all. Your mom needs to get her ish together and put her foot down with your sister. You are still a kid, you don't need to be your sisters nanny.", "you're better than me because i would have beat her ass", "NTA!  NTA!!   NTA!!!  \nYour mother should be the one handling this, not you but you did nothing wrong. Tell her that the next time she pulls a stunt like that you are going to call police and report him as an abandoned child - and do it!!  \nIs she getting child support? Is so that money should be paying for her \"rent\". She can not continue to operate this way if you and your mother stop enabling this behavior.", "NTA. Your mom\u2019s enabling your sister to be a shitty mother and a slob. Quit helping her.", "NTA - the next time she leaves her child in your care without consent you call CPS and accuse her of abandonment.", "NTA\n\nYour sister isn't taking any responsibility for her life, so why should you fill in the gaps? She doesn't work, doesn't go to school, doesn't even look after her own son, and would rather go around partying. That isn't \"tired\" and \"depressed\" that's failure to launch. She deserved to be given notice by you, even if it doesn't achieve anything beyond her knowing that she'll catch shit if she tries to dump her kid onto you again in future.", "She don't have to agree, if it goes to court and your sister has no job. No way to support him and don't have her own place, the courts can decide it would be best for him to stay with grandma."]}
