My mother and father hate my decision and have told me that if I go through with it, it would put a strain on the family. For a little bit of context, I am the oldest of three siblings by 5 years and my whole teenage years I was forced to watch and take care of my younger brother and sister, so my parents could go out and have fun. I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to parties I wasn\u2019t allowed to go out of town with friends I had to quit all my sports (football and track) because they wanted me to watch my siblings every day. My birthdays were never really about me and always about the kids. I had to let them open my presents. I had to share money that I had gotten from relatives and I had to let them blow out my candles. My parents always told me it was my job as the oldest, and that what I was doing was for the good of my siblings are. When I turned 15 my parents forced me into homeschooling so I could be home 24/7. Around that time is also when they made me drop out of all sports. Over the next three years, my parents used me as a free babysitter, and kept using the excuse that I was a great older sibling. All the meanwhile they went out every night and I am stuck at home watching them. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I love my siblings with all my heart, and nothing will change that but losing all social life and being forced to stay home all the time was a living hell. When I turned 18 I told them that now that I am an adult, I will begin looking for work and they weren\u2019t gonna stop me. We got into a huge fight which ended me going to stay with my uncle for a few days. When I explained everything to him, he went to my parents house and offered to watch my siblings while I worked so for the next two years I worked two jobs while doing homeschool at the same time. I was offered a scholarship to a mid-level college at 18 years old and took the opportunity. So now I\u2019m working two jobs and on the scholarship. On my 20th birthday I let my parents know that I had found an apartment with my uncles help and I would be moving out in two weeks. When I told them this they blew up with anger. They asked me why would I move out when my family is all here. I told them I had had enough and wanted to move out and live on my own with nobody else. That was a week ago and my mother won\u2019t talk to me and my father is angry. Trying to explain I\u2019m tearing the family apart.

Your parents haven't been parents to you, they've just been taking advantage of you. They'll probably make your next oldest sibling take your place now.

That's on your parents.", "NTA \u2013 Your parents were essentially abusive. The sacrifices they forced you to make in your childhood were not for the benefit of your siblings; they were for the benefit of your selfish parents, which means they weren\u2019t even necessary.\n\nMassive respect to you for standing up for yourself at age 18, and putting in the hard work to make something of yourself despite the anchor that your parents hung around your neck in childhood. I\u2019m so happy that you have a decent uncle who helped you when you needed it.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind is that your parents might try to make you the villain in the eyes of your siblings.

I am not a parent yet but I have always had the view that a parent's job is to prepare their kid for life beyond what they can provide. Part of the human experience in my opinion is taking that leap when you feel you are ready and going off on your own. Living life, making mistakes to learn from, experiencing hardships and persevering through them to further grow as a person. \n\nLiving on your own will suck at times.

You are NTA wanting to move out and they have no right to threaten you. OP, what your parents did is selfish and unacceptable. I am glad you got your uncle as your support. Secondly, I am not going to tell you to disown your parents as you alone can decide whether you want to go low contact or no contact on them\n\nHere is my advice which I hope you can apply:\n\n1. Get your uncle, coworkers and/or college mates to help you with your moving out\n2. Please do a credit check on yourself to ensure parents did not apply for loans under your name and protect your bank account\n3. When you move out make sure you have your identifying documents with you\n4. Go to the police and inform them that you did not run away or brainwashed by outside influence in case parents go and waste the police's time by reporting that you ran away from home or brainwashed by so-called bad influence\n5. Do not give them your new home address in case they start harassing you \n6. If they bombard you non-stop on texts or calls, temporarily block them\n7. Warn your bosses at your two jobs and college staff to keep the parents away to minimise or prevent whatever drama they intend to create", "Nta.\n\nTell your dad you hate the family.

OP this is called parentification, im so soft you basically missed out on your childhood. If I were you I would stop contact with your parents completely as they were NEVER parents, just people that gave you too much responsibility and didn't prioritize you. Move out and never look back, hope you keep a good relationship with your siblings if that's what you want!", "Wise advice", "NTA. And never give your abusers the warning you're getting out. Just get out.", "Nta.  Its okay.  Just move.  U're nver an ah.  U just a normal grown up person.  Live yourself to the fullest.  U have been parents before its time to be Bachelor. All the best.", "Fly free and experience life! They will have to parent their own kids.", "NTA they\u2019re only mad cause they can\u2019t have a free babysitter anymore, cut them out of your life", "Report them to cps NTA op", "And make a report to cps so the next sibling isn't parentified too.
