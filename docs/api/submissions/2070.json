We had the funeral on a Friday. We found out that Sunday my fianc\u00e9's brother died. The funeral for his brother was on Wednesday. The funerals were five days apart. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 lives with his Mom. He's older than 40 and makes six figures. We had plans to move in together before all the deaths.

He was driving the widow and children in his car and that there was *no room for me*. The Mom's comment clicked back in. When I questioned it, he said, \"My Mom told me to do this.\" I rattled off 3 other options that kept my fianc\u00e9 and I together without the immediate family having to drive, including using a family SUV that I could also ride in. I was the only person who was given an expectation to drive by themselves to a funeral by the mother. The other siblings with SOs were not asked to drive the widow. They were not even asked to split the driving among the siblings which would make this seem less targeted.\n\nAt this point, I didn't even feel welcome at the funeral despite my fianc\u00e9 asking me to be there. I ultimately did go to the funeral but did not feel welcome AT ALL, after being told to drive by myself.

I had a close relationship with my Mom too, but twice a day seems like a lot, especially considering they live together. My roommate thinks it's weird that he speaks to her twice a day too. \n\nI feel like he didn't defend me once again with his Mother.
