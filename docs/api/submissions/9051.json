He said no.  \n\nSo now I am shopping carefully and only buying snacks that have ingredients he cannot eat.   He has a soy allergy.  I make sure that I'll my stuff with soy is well labelled and I keep it simple in my room away from the other food.  \n\nI also picked up extra spicy snacks that he cannot handle.  \n\nHe noticed that I wasn't keeping my stuff in the pantry any more.

It\u2019s his job to provide food, if he wants snacks he can buy them himself. It\u2019s unfair of him to demand you spend your money to purchase snacks for yourself just so he can steal them. You\u2019re not picking on him, you called out a shitty behavior of his and he doesn\u2019t like it. Tell your sister if she wants to butt in and give her two cents then she can start paying for your dad\u2019s snacks", " NTA. First of all, he is the parent and you are the minor, it is his job to provide for you. \n\nSecond, it would be one thing if he were actually sharing. He isn\u2019t.

This is childish behaviour and he seems to gate keeping your money. He isn\u2019t happy that you\u2019re buying things for yourself and not for him. He says he works hard to provide?

You're a minor and it's his literal job to provide for you. You have no obligation to feed him. Your father sounds incredibly greedy and childish. Tell your dad (and your nosy sister) they can buy their own snacks. Keep a stash hidden in your room and stop sharing anything with him. No more kebabs for him either.", "NTA\n\nAs a parent of kids not much older than you, if either of them brought home snacks that they paid for, those snacks are theirs.

Buy something I like no one else does.", "NTA he is acting like he is the child and you are the adult. If he deserves snacks, he can buy snacks and as an adult he can also control when and how much he eats. If he chooses not to, it's not your problem. You sister is enabling him.", "NTA. You are not responsible for his lack of self control. You buy snacks that are safe for him with the grocery money he provides. You then use your own money to buy things special for yourself. You are 16, you are not responsible to provide for him. If he wants special snacks for just him he can do the same thing you do, buy it for himself and keep it in a safe place.", "NTA.

You're a minor; your father is supposed to be providing for you, not the other way around. \n\nHell, even if you were an adult working full time and not going to school, the idea that his kid needs to buy him snacks is laughable.", "NTA. Your dad is acting like the child in this situation. If you paid for the snacks with your own money then I see no reason for you to share. And you\u2019re not picking on him.

You should NOT be worrying about having to \"guard\" your food from him.\n\nMy husband (bless him), is the king lion in our house and he definitely takes \"Daddy tax\" on treats, lol..... my daughter learned very early that \"daddy bites\" from her ice cream cone were NOT the same as \"mommy bites\".   \nBut never would he, nor has he, taken food out of my daughter's mouth. She gets her full share of whatever she needs and then some.  \nAs a mother I feel so bad for you OP.

It's in the post.", "[deleted]", "I agree, sharing is caring but it sounds to me like OP\u2019s dad is not sharing any of the food. Much worse when he eats it, he refuses to even chip in to replace it. OP is a 16 year old and in my eyes, his father should be buying his food, especially if he is eating ALL of it. \n\nHis father clearly does not understand how to share. It sounds like if OP wants to eat he needs to hide food/ buy what his dad cannot eat. To me this slightly reeks of child neglect, and I hope that moving forward OP does not develop food insecurity problems. \n\nOP\u2019s dad needs to learn to have some self control and think about the fact that he is not the only one who needs to eat to live. \n\nNo matter what culture someone is from , no child deserves to be walked over like this by their parents, especially about something as necessary   for survival as food. \n\nOP, I offer a solution. Save some money and buy a lock box for your snacks and food. That way you can store it safely and not have to buy things your father cannot eat. Then when you want to share with him, YOU. are the one controlling the amount he gets to have, since he clearly cannot control it himself. This way you can still show you appreciate him and care about him, but have a few of your hard earned snacks for yourself. \ud83d\ude0a"]}
