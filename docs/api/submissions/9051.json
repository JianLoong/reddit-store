My dad pays for all the household food so I asked him if I could use the grocery budget to pick up those snacks since he obviously likes them.  He said no.  \n\nSo now I am shopping carefully and only buying snacks that have ingredients he cannot eat.   He has a soy allergy.  I make sure that I'll my stuff with soy is well labelled and I keep it simple in my room away from the other food.  \n\nI also picked up extra spicy snacks that he cannot handle.  \n\nHe noticed that I wasn't keeping my stuff in the pantry any more.  He said I had to share.  So I showed him the ingredients on my stuff.  And I let him try my mildest spicy snack.  He drank about a quart of milk. \n\nHe says that he works hard to provide and he deserves snacks.  I agree.  I've even bought him some he likes.  And if he didn't eat them all in one go they would last between grocery trips.  \n\nMy older sister called me and said I needed to smarten up. She says he feels like I'm picking on him.  I'm not.

You're a minor and it's his literal job to provide for you. You have no obligation to feed him. Your father sounds incredibly greedy and childish.

You should NOT be worrying about having to \"guard\" your food from him.\n\nMy husband (bless him), is the king lion in our house and he definitely takes \"Daddy tax\" on treats, lol..... my daughter learned very early that \"daddy bites\" from her ice cream cone were NOT the same as \"mommy bites\".   \nBut never would he, nor has he, taken food out of my daughter's mouth.

Much worse when he eats it, he refuses to even chip in to replace it. OP is a 16 year old and in my eyes, his father should be buying his food, especially if he is eating ALL of it. \n\nHis father clearly does not understand how to share. It sounds like if OP wants to eat he needs to hide food/ buy what his dad cannot eat. To me this slightly reeks of child neglect, and I hope that moving forward OP does not develop food insecurity problems. \n\nOP\u2019s dad needs to learn to have some self control and think about the fact that he is not the only one who needs to eat to live. \n\nNo matter what culture someone is from , no child deserves to be walked over like this by their parents, especially about something as necessary   for survival as food. \n\nOP, I offer a solution. Save some money and buy a lock box for your snacks and food. That way you can store it safely and not have to buy things your father cannot eat. Then when you want to share with him, YOU. are the one controlling the amount he gets to have, since he clearly cannot control it himself. This way you can still show you appreciate him and care about him, but have a few of your hard earned snacks for yourself. \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA, I assume he makes more money than you, so he can buy food.

You are absolutely NTA.", "Who's the parent here?? NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Good for you, buying snacks that only you can eat (and doctoring your portions of food so that they don\u2019t get eaten). I buy snacks and my husband eats them all so quickly. I go to get some and they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m not talking a little bag of something, I\u2019m talking Costco snacks. Sometimes I have to hide some so that it\u2019ll be there when I want them. I forgot to squirrel away a few of the nuts I bought for New Year\u2019s Eve and when I went to take some yesterday they were gone. I bought 2 huge bags of Costco mixed nuts barely 5 weeks ago. One bag was unsalted, which he doesn\u2019t like as much, but he still ate them all. WTF?", "NTA. It's not your job as a 16-year old to provide your father with his favorite snacks, and since he has consistently chosen to inconsiderately hog your food, you're just doing what you have to do to have snacks for yourself. \n\nIt was smart of you to figure out this strategy. It took me way too long to figure out, when I was with a similarly selfish ex boyfriend, I could only buy cherry ice cream, which he couldn't stand, if I ever wanted to eat ice cream again.", "NTA\n\nA lot of people are talking about money and buying the snacks, but for me it's the disappointment and inconvenience of not having a snack when you thought you would be able to that sucks most. Your dad is being rude. If he's going to greedily gulp down all the snacks, then the least he could do would be to replace them immediately.\n\nTell your sister that she is welcome to drop off a box of snacks for your dad whenever her little heart desires.", "Don't you like your dad? I mean its just petty what you're doing.", "He is an adult. He can totally buy his own snacks rather than making his minor child provide him snacks l. I live with my mom and I sometimes buy her snacks when I go shopping for my daughter and I, just like she sometimes buys stuff for me. You know who never provides the adults with snacks? The 14 yr old. Because they are a minor and shouldn't spend their allowance on food for the household. If they want to buy themselves snacks with their allowance they can and I will never ask for their snacks. Because adults shouldn't be taking food from the minor children in their house. [Unless the kid decides of their own free will with no manipulation that they want to do something nice for their parental figures]", "My dad used to do that to my ice cream and I haaaaaaated it. Even as an adult I find it so gross and disrespectful. I love my parents, but I think my dad's entitled attitude to food, especially the bites out of my food, damaged our relationship a bit. I learned to hide when I ate treats and to be intensely protective of my plate. Please don't do this to your kid."]}
