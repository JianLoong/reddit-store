Normal, healthy adults are capable of self restraint.\n\nSecond, he truly has no right to take what you bought with your own money.  If you buy it with his money, then yes, you need to share. Not with your own. If that means hiding it in your room, then so be it, but shame on him for forcing that. \n\nI\u2019d like to add a little side note.

So many times I've hidden stuff that he's eaten and in his completely selfish way whined about how I'm under his roof and I shouldn't be hiding snacks. \n\nBoth my dad and your dad have boundary issues, what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine. Ignore him, don't listen to what others are saying. If you stay strong, he'll eventually stop acting like a baby cause it's getting him nowhere and either just not eat anything or buy his own.", "NTA.... your dad needs to give you a list of snacks he wants to eat, and the money to buy them if you are the one that does the shopping. Keep looking for ways to keep your money separate from household money, try to put in savings account that has limited access.

Being generous is good, but so is learning to save and budget. Good luck to you.", "NTA. You are 16. You are not the parent here - that's your dad.

That's really hard to unlearn and it will affect other aspects of the relationship.", "Sounds like the kid learned to say no to her dad and stares him down if he gets too close (which I grew up with too lol and this sounds adorable to me), so boundaries have actually been taught lol...as long as dad respects those boundaries this actually sounds like a good thing in this case.\n\nHowever I'm not trying to diminish your experience, comparatively I hate being tickled because my dad tickled HARD and wouldn't take no for an answer. To this day I love tickling family because cute giggles but STOP WHEN ASKED and can't stand it when it happens to me.", "NTA. \n\nI had to hide food in my room from a parent and it was awful. I\u2019m sorry you have that same experience.", "Ask him how much of HIS food YOU are expected to pay for with YOUR hard-earned money.  Ask him if he wants you to drop out of school and work full-time to feed both of you, which is weird, since he's supposed to be feeding you, not the reverse.", "NTA. It\u2019s a parent\u2019s job to provide for the minor child. Not the other way around. \n\nUnless of course, it\u2019s kebabs w/garlic cilantro sauce and then I want some. \ud83e\udd23", "Is he your father or your roommate because he is not acting like a father rn", "NTA, kind of brilliant actually, and I appreciate that you do buy snacks he likes too.  but I hope you actually like all the food you buy and don\u2019t end up with ulcers and other issues from the super spicy snacks.", "NTA\n\nHe's a grown ass man, if he works hard and deserves snacks then he can bloody well buy his own snacks", "NTA\n\nFunny thing is that he's going to be shocked when you eventually move out and go NC with him.", "Tell him to grow up and stop being greedy NTA", "As opposed to his dad eating everything and not sharing?", "I\u2019m liking \u201cpoison test\u201d!", "Oh no I don\u2019t like this. You sound like you\u2019re a well adjusted adult though despite how food was treated around you as a child. All power to you and thanks for sharing your experience.", "You\u2019re sister needs to smarten up and stfu. NTA", "My son won't even make me a cuppa tea unless it's Xmas or there is money on the table, and I'm damn proud of him for that! You are not endebted to your father in any way, shape, or form. What's yours is yours, and anybody who takes your things without your permission is a thief.", "NTA", "NTA. You have to look after yourself since nobody else is caring about you.", "NTA. i personally think\u2026 you\u2019re 16, he SHOULD BE providing snacks for you, not the other way around.\n\nthe fact that you\u2019re 16 and expected to provide for your adult father is weird.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t owe your dad snacks out of your money at 16. My caveat would be: you may be right but he is still your dad and you live in his house. Just buy less snacks until you move out because this fight probably isn\u2019t worth your stress if he decides to dig in his heels here. Like your dad is the asshole but ultimately who cares, he is still providing for you and giving you shelter and outside of this quirk a decent enough guy.", "NTA if you pay for it it's yours", "NTA.  You are 16, let him get his own snacks", "NTA, who's the parent here? He should be buying you snacks! Lol sounds like you DID smarten up! He's not entitled to the food you buy with your own money!", "NTA. Dad can buy more stuff too. Sounds like dad wants to eat all the snacks and that is just that.", "If you are, then so am I, cause I used to drench my food in hot sauce just to keep my brothers from begging for \"a bite.\" \n\nNTA, he can buy snacks if he wants them.", "NTA", "NTA, you also need food and it\u2019s his job to feed you as his minor child, not the other way around", "NTA, if you almost never bought anything for him I would feel different, but you regularly include him with things he can eat.", "Wow your dad has an issue here. NTA.", "NTA.\nI spent my entire childhood waking up to having all my snacks gone because my brother would eat anything and everything, even though he was aware what snacks were specifically mine. He just didn\u2019t care, and it sounds like your dad doesn\u2019t care either.\nIf he wants those specific snacks he can buy them himself. You\u2019re NTA at all. Enjoy your snacks.", "OP well played since their is enough evidence to justify action NTA", "NTA. He's an adult he can buy his own snacks", ">\toffer to buy him the snacks that he likes with his money.\n\nOP already tried that. He was told no.", "My husband and I do this when we make each other food too! We usually just call it the \"______ tax\" depending on what we're making lol"]}
