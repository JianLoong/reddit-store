So I love him like he\u2019s one of my own kids, and am very protective of him. Our dad gifted me and her his 1967 Shelby Mustang once we got to high school, but left it to her in his will. It still burns my ass since I love that car, but I got the money so I guess I\u2019ll live haha. Also, my sister was a major gear head and loved cars since she was a kid which factored into his decision.\n\nMy sister left the Mustang to my nephew on the condition that he only receive it when he gets his license and on his 16th birthday. When he got the car he loved it and promised to take special care of it since it was his mom\u2019s. And as far as I can tell he has been taking care of it.\n\nMy brother in law got remarried to a total c-u-next-Tuesday of a person named Claire. She\u2019s an awful person, but she\u2019s very pretty and manipulative so BIL fell for it and they got married. Claire and my nephew don\u2019t get along at all and unfortunately my BIL has been blinded by her and takes her side in their fights.\n\nWell my nephew told me that my BIL took his Mustang because he got in trouble at school, and he\u2019s given it to Claire to use. I went to my BIL\u2019s house to hear his side and he confirmed it. He said my nephew needed discipline and Claire wanted the car to use. I was seeing red, but I told him that it was legally my nephew\u2019s car, he said that it didn\u2019t matter, he was a minor and living under his roof so he would follow his rules.\n\nI was furious, but my evil mind put together a plan. I have a very good job, and I have a dear beloved husband who comes from a very wealthy family, so we have a lot of disposable income. Long story short, I got him a 2022 Shelby Mustang GT500. \nI drove the car over to his house and handed him the keys in front of Claire who looked dumbfounded. Admittedly it was worth it just to see her face. BIL called me and told me I was undermining his authority as a parent and being an ahole by enabling his bad behavior and being petty. I said he was unfairly punishing my nephew by taking away his property and that it was only a lease until he gives back his car.\n\nNow I\u2019m wondering, was I being shortsighted and reactionary by doing something so petty? Was I an ahole?", "created_utc": 1675978302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y6uoe/aita_for_buying_my_nephew_a_new_car_out_of_spite/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he had just taken the keys it would be a different story, but it's not up to him to give the car to Claire.", "ESH\n\nClaire is the big winner here. She shouldn't be driving around the young man's car without his explicit permission, and I doubt he gave it. She more than likely has manipulated the situation to get something she wants. It's wrong. \n\nIt's also not your place to interfere with the discipline of a child. I get it and can appreciate the situation.", "The BIL permanently took the car and gave it to Claire to use? \n\nESH.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have underminded the parents authority, how they raise their kid is their choice.  Not even sure what the nephew did, or if the punishment was fitting. \n\nBut \u2026 the 1967 car wasn\u2019t the BIL to give away, especially since it was his nephews mother\u2019s.  So it had Sentimental value. But giving the nephew a new mustang he can\u2019t afford (insurance is pricey for teenagers) for the BIL to take away again wasn\u2019t an smart move, and doesn\u2019t change the fact that your sister\u2019s 1967 is still with Claire. \n\nA better move would be to legally sue BIL/Claire for the 1967 Mustang back to yourself (OP), and regift it back to your nephew once he turns 18/out of the house.", "NTA even if he deserved punishment the car should never have been given to that woman. Don\u2019t be surprised if he moves in with you at 18", "ESH.\n\nThis was an oversized reaction on both sides and the only one who is making out like a bandit here is nephew.  \n\nBIL does have a right to punish your nephew for what was a very real violation of a school rule.  You showing up with a newer, more expensive car, doesn't serve to teach the nephew a lesson at all and is a big spite move.  Now the nephew knows you'll bail him out of any trouble as long as he frames it in a way that is about Claire.\n\nHowever, him taking away the car, unless it was somehow complicit in your nephew ditching the assembly, was over the top also.  Plus if Claire had been coveting the car for a while, its easy to make the logical jump that this was just an excuse to get the car out from under your nephew.  Plus the will stipulated the car was his once he turned 16 and had his license.  Assuming he'd been taking care of it as well and paying for all the expenses, your BIL shouldn't have a claim to the car.\n\nBe adults and work this out and don't let the kid play you both against each other.\n\n\nEdit after info answered:\n~~INFO~~\n\n~~Leaning toward N-T-A given the info already.  Just for the sake of the question (and this is probably going to be a dumb question give how you described Claire and your BIL), but what exactly did your nephew do that led to the car being taken away?~~", "Claire has NO business driving that car\u2026period!", "NTA. I bet your BIL was just looking for some excuses so he can take your nephew's car away to give it to Claire to use.", "NTA, this is my level of pettiness, and I\u2019d do the same for my nephews, just to spite my SIL, however, the way you describe your nephew\u2019s situation raises some red flags. Please make sure to pay close attention, and assure him, that you\u2019re always there for him, because this seems like just the beginning of what stepmom is capable of doing to ruin his relationship with his dad.", "YTA - but I love you for it! HAHAHAHAHA I had a rich auntie too and it's amazing to have someone on your side even when your wrong.    Keep up the bad work and keep posting for us!", "**ESH.**\n\nYou can't just buy someone else's minor child a car like that. There are all sorts of safety and responsbility issues that need to taken into consideration ALONG with obtaining approval from the parents.\n\nBut, there is no reason the new wife should be driving around in your nephew's car either. I don't know the legal situation surrounding a minor's rights to their property while living with their parents, but it is an **AH** move regardless.", "I kinda see your BIL's point of view but in the balance, given the heritage of the car YNTA. If BIL had just taken away your nephews keys as a disciplinary action it would have been fine. But given the fact the car was a legacy from his mother, that your nephew and step mother don't get along and then BIL gave the car to the step mom to use....well that is being an insensitive asshole to his son. It strikes me as being less about disciplining his kid for infractions at school than being about getting back at your nephew for not being thrilled with his new wife.", "NTA. \n\nYour bil is bigtime. \n\nGave his new squeeze his son's car from his dead mother. That's prize a h territory right there.", "NTA. BIL had no right to give the car to Claire even if it\u2019s only to borrow. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have stepped in that way, but that\u2019s what uncles and aunts do from time to time anyway.", "INFO: is the paper work for the car in your nephew's name?", "Since your nephew legally owns the car, maybe he could hand the deed over to you and you could legally hold onto the car it until he turns 18. Then you could give it back to him when he then hopefully moves out. At least then Claire couldn't keep her grubby hands on it.", "INFO: How long was the punishment supposed to be when he wouldn't have his car? It's completely reasonable to tell your minor child that they can't use the car as punishment for something related to the car or extremely offensive. Like, he snuck out of the house to drive late at night or lying about where they were. So as punishment give me your keys for a week or something. But letting his wife drive it makes him the AH as the car isn't his to let someone else borrow it.", "You are the BEST kind of asshole!  HAHAHAHAHA If only i could.  Don't feel bad about it, let it ride (haha) at least your nephew knows you have his back.  Too bad he can't live with you.", "ESH, but the father and step mother far more than OP.  While I agree with OP\u2019s feelings, OP really shouldn\u2019t be interfering with BIL\u2019s punishments. But, in less than a year, BIL can\u2019t do this.", "Assuming any of this is true, which I have my doubts about, supporting your nephew is far more important than sticking it to your BIL. And throwing cars at him and solving his problems for him isn\u2019t actually support. YTA.", "Very nice but yes YTA for castrating your BIL's authority. Your BIL is an ahole as well for letting his new wife use the car that wasn't even his to do that with. It would have been better to take it away until nephew's actions turned around in school or some other action.", "INFO: Is this just an attempt to flex?", "Kind of YTA\n\nSo your nephew currently owns roughly $200k worth of cars. That\u2019s a very big spite. I don\u2019t hate what you\u2019re doing but ... what lesson are you trying teach your nephew here? Cars grow on trees? \n\nThis was not a great plan.... BIL didn\u2019t give her the car he just took it away from nephew because he was holding him accountable for his actions. That\u2019s not a bad thing. Claire sounds like an ah", "ESH\n\nThere two separate issues, BIL removing access to the car and allowing Claire to use the car.\n\n>I said he was unfairly punishing my nephew by taking away his property\n\nBased on what?  You haven't articulated why.  The only reason you've put forth is because you dislike Claire.  Parents removing access to privileges is a common punishment so you are absolutely undermining his authority.  Congrats, nephew drives the 2022, Claire still drives the 1967.", "Oh, you're definitely an AH for what you did, but so are they. Being said, I kinda agree with what you did and curious to see how it plays out and if Claire tries to yank the keys to the GT500. If you have the money I'd even look at getting a TRO against Claire and put the 67' into conservatorship until nephew is 18 to protect it against damage from her.", "YTA your undermining a parent but I get your frustration with taking away nephew\u2019s property but you shouldn\u2019t have got in the middle of it", "Soft YTA and INFO: what did the nephew do at school to get his mom\u2019s Mustang taken away?", "NTA That punishment doesn't fit the crime at all, and how long is it supposed to last? Sounds like Claire manipulated to get the car. BIL's a tool.", "YTA. His dad is his guardian while he's still a minor.", "YTA.  You would have been alright if you talked to you BIL and asked for his wife not to drive the car.  However, you nephew cut a mandatory school function to hang out with a girlfriend.  BIL was absolutely spot on to punish him and it\u2019s was absolutely overstepping to get car for your nephew.
