So let's go back awhile.\n   Me and his sister were best friends for YEARS since 6th grade. I met her brother around the time I graduated thought he was really cute and got engaged about 1 year and a half later and I was super stoked to have my SIL as a bridesmaid. So dress shopping comes and she tells me she can't make it so she can \"watch her dog\". Later maybe 30 mins after the appointment I check the family group chat and find out she went to a party. That hurt my feelings a little bit so I simply just said \"I hope you are having fun\" and then she said she forgot and blamed me for not reminding her. \n\n  She ghosted me refused to talk about it like adults and such so I took her out of my bridal party. At this point she's no longer a bridesmaid. Few months later we meet up at this beautiful beach with his family (my inlaws) and she's there. I decided to not let it bother me at all so I'm just walking around with my fiance collecting rocks, going swimming, all that. When we go back to the area we have set up so we can eat she breaks down crying! Explaining that I wasn't upset and acting like nothing happened. MIL later tries to convince me to talk to, I don't comply. I said if she's actually sorry and wants to talk like adults she should come to me first not you. And now today after all this time she had her mother ask my fiance to let her have a \"special entrance\" at the wedding so she still feels important since she's not in the bridal party anymore. With the bridal shower coming up so soon I don't even know if I want to invite her and MIL.\n\nAm I the a-hole?\n\nEdit: My fiance is actually not putting up with their shi. He actually doesn't even want me to invite her to the wedding. After his mother asked him that he said no. They never really got along but after all this he actually wants nothing to do with her. Sorry for not making that clear.\n\nEdit 2: so sorry I didn't think I'd as many responses here more backstory\n After we got engaged she expressed that she was \"a little salty \" that me and my fiance were engaged and we talked it out and it turns out she was a little jealous that we were having a good relationship vs her and her bf of 7 years. She told this to me. Before all of this when I got with her brother and what not she also would periodically ghost me and not talk to me if I did anything she didn't wanna do or if I did something she doesn't like but I enjoy. I have an existing amount of issues we've had. Like when she tried to convince her parents that I sent HER nudes to some guy in Cali, when this happened I was in PA with my family. They were sent off her phone. There is more but I just feel like maybe I started to notice a pattern and now I'm deciding to be done.

That means invite her to the more open events, and she isn't entitled to special entrances, gifts, or gatherings she wouldn't otherwise have a role in.  Don't play games or give her the silent treatment, just keep it on that level--friendly, nice, but unless she wants to sit down and hash things out, nothing more.\n\nI suspect she wants that special entrance because she doesn't want to be embarrassed by people speculating about or outright asking what she did to be excluded from the party.", "NTA but also not worth causing bad blood over.

No, she can have a seat.", "NTA! She's admittedly envious and jealous of your relationship, her own brother and mad at her current BF for not taking their relationship to the next level. All of those are HER problems. Until she decides to fix her situations, continue with the low and/or NC. Her friendship with you is conditional, so why do you even want that in your life?

You know your relationship with her doesn't end after the wedding, right?", "NTA but also, I wouldn't uninvite her from events just because she didn't want to go dress shopping with you.  Remove her from the bridal party or whatever but invite her to the shower and wedding and all that stuff.\n\nIn the long run, even though you think she's being childish, she's going to be your family for the foreseeable future and a wedding isn't really a good reason to potentially destroy the relationships with his family over this.", "So many questions... \n\nAre you sure this is a family you want to marry into?

If you married young and it didn\u2019t work out, that\u2019s your experience.. don\u2019t take it out on OP.. if not, then her age shouldn\u2019t make a difference to you. Nor should the age of her fianc\u00e9. It\u2019s only 6 years.. not 20.. they have known each other a long time.. you\u2019re acting like he\u2019s groomed her.. which is getting to be a ridiculous accusation anymore that\u2019s getting out of hand. She\u2019s old enough to make her own decision. I\u2019m not trying to argue or upset you but get off her back about the age thing. Lots of people marry young and it works out fine.

Probably feeling replaced in her family by you\n\nJealousy and envy are dangerous things.  \n\nI think your friend may need her friend right now but she can't have her and can't vent to her because to do so will probably turn her family against her. \n\nIMO show her a little compassion and grace.

He doesn't talk to his family much, its kinda always been like that. That's a good possibility. Her and her brother were never close and they don't have much of a relationship, they never really did so I'm not sure. But I could agree with you. She doesn't talk to me. I tried reaching out yesterday and a few times before. I'd really like to talk with her, But she just leaves me on read. Suggestions?", "Did you ask her if it was okay to date her brother?", "So when we got there and I saw him and asked who he was, she told me he was her brother. Told her I thought her brother was cute and she actually urged me to go talk to him. So I didn't think I needed too."]}
