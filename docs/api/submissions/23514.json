So that justification is not a good faith one. It just happens to fit your situation now, while attempting to erase your past roles.\n\nOn top of that, you keeping him out will mean when you do allow him to play he\u2019ll be playing against larger people who can cause more damage, he\u2019ll be less experienced than his peers, and less prepared to play the game \u201csafely.\u201d\n\nAnd beyond the is it safe question, you and your wife were in agreement, but did he know that.

And from all the learning we've had to do since the accident that disabled her, and from what he has taught us . . . there is no world in which I would let any kid of mine play football or hockey.\n\nYou coaching has nothing to do with the choices you make for your own children, other than perhaps giving you some really good insight to help you make informed decisions. You being a coach isn't going to make other parents more or less likely to put their kids in the sport. If anything, though, if you're a good coach you can be one of the ones who tries to mitigate the worst of things by not pushing kids to get back on the field after likely head injuries.\n\nBut as I have noted on this sub before, too many people don't understand not just the seriousness of head injury and concussion, but how insidious it is. My sister's accident - which took her from being a bright, talented young lawyer who got multiple promotions in a single year, to barely being able to read a children's book or fill in a simple form, and getting confused trying to tell time - wasn't some multi-car pile-up. It was a fender bender that didn't leave a single scratch on either her car or her body. But - and this is exactly the issue with football and hockey, because of the helmets - her brain *got shaken around inside of her skull* like the ice in a martini shaker. And she'll never be the same.\n\nThe odds of someone with TBI getting Alzheimer's or another form of dementia are 50%.\n\nStatistics are looking more and more like over 90% of NFL players and 60-70% of NHL players have shown up with CTE when their brains were examined at Boston University's specialized brain bank doing research into this. These are variable statistics, but consistent enough to be horrifying. The rates were 91% for college football players, BTW, and 21% for high school. It starts early.\n\nAll sports come with risk, and as a former early childhood educator I'm a big fan of risky play and roughhousing, because I think kids need that, to feel confident and strong in their bodies. But there are so many sports where the risk is short-term or calculated in reasonable ways . . . not ways that look like permanent, debilitating brain damage and the likelihood of CTE. You are NTA. Let your kid pick a different sport.", "Info: so you were okay when kids you coached in middle school got head injuries? Weren't you own kids I guess.", "Did you expressly tell your son he couldn\u2019t play contact until he was in high school or just kept telling him \u201cwhen your older\u201d?

I'd assume you know more about football and what's appropriate for your child than just about anyone else.", "So you are going to let him play once he gets into high school, with no experience against kids that have been playing  for years? I don't understand your logic.", "YTA\n\nFor two reasons. I have studied this subject a lot and have interviewed other youth football coaches and former players about this. The main counter I have to you not letting him play now is that you are hurting his development if he intends to play this seriously throughout high school and college. Learning how to play in middle school allows your kid to master fundamentals while quite frankly, he's less likely to be playing against kids that can do real damage at this stage.\n\nIf you let your kid start tackle football in high school and he goes up against players that have done it for years, they can really hurt him if he's not prepared.\n\nI think this is an all or nothing decision. Either you let your kid play tackle football now or not at all.\n\nSecond, you have to teach your kid to make their own choices and stick by those choices. There are going to be times in life that your kid may put themselves in the line of fire. What if he wants to travel? What if he wants to join the army or be a cop one day?\n\nMy advice, sit him down and explain some of the risks you are concerned about. At 11-12 years old, he is probably old enough to hear this. Then, you can be the one to coach him and teach him proper fundamentals if he still wants to play knowing the injury risks", "NTA you've not said never which would be unfair, i do hope you haven't been moving the goalposts though", "I would have an issue with it if you coached his age group,  but there's nothing hypocritical about coaching the age that you think is appropriate for him to start.

There is a huge disparity of sizes in boys that age and I had 2 concussions. Those were in the \u201che got his bell ring, just walk it off\u201d days. \n\nYou are 100% correct. Let him play flag football or maybe soccer for a bit. You can still coach him privately (punt, pass and kick) stuff. \n\nBut keep him out of contact sports until, as they say, \u201che grows some hair\u201d.

It *is* hypocritical for you to say you don\u2019t want your son to possibly sustain a head injury when you clearly had no issues letting other kids sustain those same potential head injuries. \n\nPlus, I would argue that he should start when all the other kids on the team are also starting. If he\u2019s the only new player in high school not only will he be miles behind everyone else skill wise but he will be the only inexperienced player and *that* could open him up to more injuries.\n\nLet him start playing now or don\u2019t let him play because he will get injured either way. Making him wait until everyone else is good and has a better handle on the game will leave him worse off than letting him learn alongside everyone else. \n\nI would have been so beyond pissed if my dad coached a sports team but didn\u2019t let me play.

You cant expect your kid to understand or except your moral high ground if you coached middle school, you litrally have no ground to stand on.\n\nSport professionals rarely come from picking up a sport in high school, its been a passion since they were small and theve done it all their life. Not saying he wants to go pro but there is a big difference in skill with a kid thats playd all their life and your son coming in at high school.\n\nIt makes no sense to say we dnt want head injury so young but high school is ok, its still the same head, the same injury. \n\nNo parent wants their child to be hurt but stopping them just because you want to wrap them in cotton wool is a crap excuse.\n\nIn school my bro playd rugby constant broken nose, black eyes, few concusions,even broke collor bone but playd till end of match cause he loved it, mom didnt make him quit. I also made school team for netball and hockey, non contact sport i b fine. Omg no do you know what i endured from opposite team. Netball the defense knowing ref not watching would push you so hard your head bounced off the floor, they would trip you over, pull hair, dig in your ribs. Freaking hocky the worst, you in position waiting for whistle and your marking partner would hit you in the shin with all they had so hard, shin pads rattled and the pain was so intense i wanted to cry and drop to the floor but carried on. Sticks to your face, whoops accident and if they teamed up they made sure that hockey ball smashed your face. It was really painful and i was scared every match incase the other team were mean like that, not all were.

Mindset to hit a guy that's 300 pounds head on for the first time,  not being used to it from a younger age? Maybe?  Depends on the kid. \n\nJohn Madden wrote a pretty good article that at every age they spend too much time hitting and not working on fundentals though.", "While I understand your sentiment, I disagree here on 2 counts.\n\n>You coach HS now, but you coached middle before and didn\u2019t seem to have an issue with exposing other peoples kids to something you think is too dangerous for them\n\nWhile I, personally, don't think kids in general should play football, I think this is a cheap and unfair argument. Some middle schoolers are 5'10\", some are still barely 5'. A middle schooler who's 5'10\" and well into puberty is going to be much better equipped to play against other middle schoolers than the kid who's 5' & not gone through puberty, which would be a strong argument for that kid to wait until hs to play. Some kids are less mature or don't to listen to instructions (which is important in dangerous contact sports), while others are will listen to avoid injury or are just overall more mature. Kids are all over the developmental scale at that age, so what's right for one child may not be right for another child. You're making irrelevant and unfair assumptions by acting like OP cares more about his kid than other kids because of the decision he made for his child vs the decision *other* parents made for their children.\n\n>On top of that, you keeping him out will mean when you do allow him to play he\u2019ll be playing against larger people who can cause more damage, he\u2019ll be less experienced than his peers, and less prepared to play the game \u201csafely.\u201d\n\nSo this idea has actually been proven to be untrue. In actuality, studies have found that kids that play competitively in a sport from an earlier age have a HIGHER risk of injury and psychological stress, and don't really have that big of an advantage over kids that started a little later.", "Thank you for explaining so eloquently. I really wish more people, especially parents, would take seriously the risks of such sports.\n\nI think so many people navigate life without having experienced much in the way of serious illness or injury (or haven't been close to someone who has) \u2014 so they can be dangerously optimistic. \u201cNah, that couldn\u2019t happen to me or my family. We\u2019ll be more careful than those other people who\u2019ve been injured.

The more we learn, the worse it is. If you believe you should do what you reasonably can to prevent concussions for your child, why would any age flip a switch to say, ok let the concussions begin!? It wouldn't. That's illogical. \n\nThere is no age at which a doctor would *recommend* engaging in activity known to cause concussions and CTE.\n\nBeyond that, dad's love of the game is likely feeding his son's desire to play. I can see how a kid might be disappointed to find his dad volunteering so much time to coach other kids, time he could otherwise spend with the son. Then when the son shows interest in joining the sport, dad rejects him? Any kid is upset when they can't do what they want, but when that thing is so central to dad's life, it's hard to see how that won't cause problems for the relationship between the two.\n\nPoor kid.", "I would personally be in favor of no contact until high school, but unfortunately that isn\u2019t how it is around here.", "I think my brother is more hung up on the fact that I used to coach middle school ball and won\u2019t let my son play it now. \n\nYou\u2019re right though.

He cannot make choices for other people's children. But as a coach he can at least be the kind of coach who discourages putting kids back on the field post-concussion.

The bill never passed. \n\nIf kids are allowed to play tackle football at 10 years old and they eventually become 16 year olds that know how to properly tackle, how would a 14 year old that has never been exposed to that before deal with a hit from one of those players? \n\nNot to mention that football is not the only sport prone to concussions. It means you'd have to ban hockey and fighting sports as well if you are a parent. Then you have basketball and soccer which are ankle injuries and ACL injuries waiting to happen. \n\nMy point is that there is risk no matter how you slice it", "In the modern era, rule changes and equipment mitigate the risks. Simple numbers\u2026. Thousands and thousands of kids play, how many of them end up with CTE? About equal to being struck by lightning. The car ride home or having a bunk bed is more dangerous, but you don\u2019t question\u2026 but you don\u2019t question those risks because they are so tiny you realize the benefits out way them. In the OPs case, the benefits of not being TA outweighs the finite risk.", "No... I'm sorry but this is not entirely true. They could actually be doing more damage if they purposefully do not let him play until high school because he won't be prepared to play against veterans by then. \n\nYes, he'll never get hit before high school if he doesn't play. However, he likely won't know how to take a hit or give out a hit against guys that are going to be more built for it by high school. \n\nI've talked to youth football coaches and parents who played football themselves about this very issue. They pretty much told me exactly what I said above. It's important to teach them the right fundamentals and expose them to it at a younger age if you are going to play at all", "Baloney\u2026. The statistical chances of a kid getting a brain injury in youth football nowadays its less risky than the car ride home.", "If it was that dangerous it would be outlawed or atleast not generally accepted by society", "I am probably one of very few coaches in my area that would be in favor of it.\n\nOld habits die hard unfortunately.\n\nThanks for the reassurance.", "Damar. Hamlin. We\u2019re still learning", "ummm no. \n\nhttps://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/2023/02/06/researchers-find-cte-in-345-of-376-former-nfl-players-studied/\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2021/12/14/1064130612/phillip-adams-nfl-player-killed-6-people-cte", "OP i'm going YTA  \n\nI get it you want to protect him but look the danger is never going away at any level no matter what\n\nand i have a strange feeling this is just a delay tactic in hoped he gives up wanting to play at all", "You\u2019re NTA for being protective of your child. You\u2019re absolutely a hypocrite, and if you live in a small town, and your brother and son stay pissed off enough, you may since answering to do about how you have no issues risking someone else\u2019s child.", "You cannot compare nfl players to little league.", "I\u2019m very familiar with CTE. My favorite baseball player (and favorite athlete) was the first baseball player to be confirmed CTE positive (diagnosis can only be made postmortem) but the way collegiate and nfl linemen hit each other and peewee football players just aren\u2019t comparable. Think about it logically. Odds are there are hundreds of peewee football players in your town every year\u2026.. and hundreds more in the next town, and the next, and the next and so forth \u2026. If there was that close a correlation between MIDDLE SCHOOL aged football and brain damage, you would see it precedent throughout society, there would literally be hundreds of instances in every single community."]}
