You\u2019re fine.\n\nThat woman needs a hobby.", "NTA every store I have ever been to has the policy that if there are no disabled spots available that disable people should use the family spots, to the point one store even has put up signs saying family spots are for family or disabled.  You did nothing wrong, the store manager knows you did nothing wrong.  This person was being entitled and an ahole", "NTA your need is greater than hers. When my kids were that age I had stopped using the family spaces because my kids were big enough to walk and I didn't need the extra space to manoeuvre them in and out, unlike toddlers.", "NTA at all\n\nI would say though that you should tell management when people are parked like that. \n\nLet them manage the towing, tell them you're upset no one is monitoring as disabled spots are legally mandated.", "NTA\n\nShe can F off.\n\nYou are disabled and need to park close by.

I don't have a badge or anything as my back pain comes and goes, it's not the end of the world or anything but in this instance I thought it was harmless. \n\nWhen I came out, someone approached me and told me I was being selfish, I didn't try to explain or anything, I just said I didn't see it likely that the other family spaces would fill up in the time it took for me to get my shopping  done as it was near closing time. \n\nSorry this happened to you, there's really no need for people to act like this, especially when you've explained your situation, which you didn't even need to! \n\nHope your day has been better since!", "NTA. I too have a bad phyiscal disability where I need that extra room to be able to get out of the vehicle. I also have a disability placard, & this just makes me mad for you. And I agree that it is more for pregnant parents or w/ babies/toddlers. \nAlso, don't know if you are in the US but it is illegal for someone without a disability placard to park in a marked disabled spot. It's a pretty hefty fine if someone who has a placard & needs the spot at that moment & someone is parked there that doesn't. I've called the non-emergency line a fews times for this.

Also Handicapped plates/plaques in the united states give you access to any and all parking zones except police (even personalized ones) and no parking zones, technically. In most states you don't even have to feed parking meters if you park in an ordinary spot. (Its accounted for in the cost of the placard/plate). So not only are you NTA, you are legally the person with the (second to police) highest priority for all parking. It seems weird to have to explain this but my dad was handicapped (Disabled Vet) with the plates for almost 20 yrs before a parking enforcement police person told him this.", "NTA", "NTA. Disabled people get priority over parents. If you have an actual mobility issue, you have an actual need. Parent parking is a convenience that people get overly entitled to.", "NTA. You could have kids, but could have left them at home. There is nothing saying your kids have to be there with you when using the spot. Those are assumptions made by those who lobbied for the spots. \n\nThey aren't legally enforceable in my area.

I have nothing against kids or parents but mobility issues should trump convenience for families every time. That's why disabled spots and permits are required by legislation and new parent spots aren't. \n\nIf that lady wants to be mad, she should be mad that the disabled spots were filled with people without permits. Not verbally attack a woman with a cane AND a parking permit in a parking lot or try to get them towed.", "Definitely NTA, her child was not the age group it was designated for. Funny story, I had a friend who worked at a store where these complaints were common. The store had a nice paved and railed off walkway at the far end of the parking lot that led directly to the front doors. Management moved the designated family friendly parking spots there as the railed off walkway was 'safer' for families with young children. While not ideal for the disabled, it did indeed stop the parents with older children being entitled about those spots.", "NTA, honestly these spots annoy me. Would rather see more disabled parking with pregnant or after birth having that access as well. Clearly you're in need of the spot. Classic entitled parent.", "NTA.  The only legally required spots are handicap, the others are for convenience regardless what they are called.  Can\u2019t legally ticket or force someone out of a made up spot.", "NTA. \n\nAny way you could have let the store know that people were parking in the disabled spots without proper tags? You would have done a lot of disabled people a favor.", "NTA. I am sorry this happened to you. You are all good.", "YTA. You get upset at non handy capable people parking in the handy capable spots.  Then you shouldn't park in another designated spot that you don't qualify for.  It's not a trickle down system where handi capable trump's pregnant woman, which trump's regular joe.  \n\nYou took the spot away from someone who may have needed it, for your own convenience.

She shouldn't of done that but it doesn't make you less of an asshole for taking the spot.", "ESH", "NTA\n\nThose family parking spots are a consideration, not a requirement. And more often than not, not enforceable.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. But you did leave something out.\n\nIf I'm ever at a public place and more than one disability spot is taken by a person without plates, I immediately call the non-emergency line. No hesitation, no guilt. I am not ashamed to do it.\n\nI do that because I used to live with my grandfather. He used a walker and he had a disability placard. I would drive him to church or to the store or just to go to the park to sit on a park bench for some fresh air.\n\nHe had a hard time walking long distances. Towards the end of his life, just going 50 feet would leave him needing to take a breather. So it would annoy me to no end when the disability spots were taken by someone with no plates or placard. Those people can walk an extra 50 feet to get a parking spot, which was something my grandpa would have had a hard time doing.\n\nSo even though I don't need those spots myself, I have no qualms with plate-checking (and placard-checking) cars. If you don't have a plate or a placard, I'm reporting it.", "Just hopping in the top comment to say that in the US (some laws differ by state), a handicap placard entitles you to park in the closest available spot *regardless* of other rules that may apply to that spot. For example, if all handicapped reserved spots were taken, you would be legally allowed to park in spots reserved for merchants, vendors, short term parking, or even metered spots for free. You would be ABSOLUTELY legally (and morally) allowed to park in a family-reseved spot if all handicapped-reserved spot were taken.", "Also, in most places, a disabled placard/plate will let you ignore signs like \"10 min parking only\" and \"expectant mother parking only\". About the only thing you can't ignore are the \"red zones\" reserved for fire trucks & EMT's.", "As a pregnant woman who has entered into the waddling stage, I have no issues with a disabled person using family parking.

I wasn't sure what \"family parking\" really meant.  I'm guessing this is in the UK (pram).  \n\nWhat you explained is the same as the US.  Any parking directed at family, pregnant women, young kids, veterans, etc is not a legal designation.  Disabled spots absolutely are.", "If 3/4 of shoppers have kids with them, how does having 2 spots for 'families with small children' help out at all?\n\nWe need to just drop all the special spots that aren't for people with handicapped placards.

The intention is for the person using it to be able to open their car door wider than a regular space may allow, whether for getting a baby car seat in and out, strapping a wriggly child into a car seat (which is compulsory up to a specific height/age that I can\u2019t remember off the top of my head as my toddle is way off that yet) or for manoeuvring a baby bump in and out (though I always feel guilty using it if I don\u2019t have my toddler and usually just try and park in an end space so I have loads of room anyway, much to hubs amusement). It is very frustrating to see people without children/bumps using the spaces but disability, especially if all the disabled spaces are taken, would be completely understandable and NTA for me\u2026", "Also, were you using your cane ?
