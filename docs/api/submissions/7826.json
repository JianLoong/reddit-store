And I'm sorry.", "NTA\n\nIf the disabled spaces are all occupied, It's perfectly sensible for you to opt for the next best option.", "NTA I always thought family spots were for disabled people and parents with babies / toddlers ( as strapping them into the car / putting them in their stroller requires room). Not for parents with 6 year olds that have perfectly fine motor function.", "NTA\n\nFamily parking spots are not very common where I live. I\u2019m not sure why they are necessary unless you have 3+ infants to wrangle in and out of your car at once.\n\nI had a child without using a special space and see families in parking lots having no issue using regular parking spots.", "I have two small kids. As a parent to two such tiny people, I understand why these family parking spots exist and I deeply appreciate them.\n\nUnder regular circumstances, I would say it's wrong to park in these spots if you don't have small kids. But then again, it's also wrong to park in the disabled parking if you don't have disabilities.\n\nWhere I live, it's quite unfair that sometimes there's, like, 4 disabled parking spots for every 1 family spot. Sigh. There are more families with small kids than disabled people. Just how it is.\n\nTo top it off, I regularly see the family spots hogged up by people who most certainly aren't families.\n\nHowever, your situation was entirely unique.\n\nFirst off, I think the management at the shopping centre should fine non-disabled people for parking in the disabled spots. As in, if you don't have a disabled sign on your car, you'd better be in a wheelchair when you get back (or something), otherwise you get fined. Done!\n\nIn most cases, the 'family spots' are really actually for people with small kids. Where I live, these spots are often called 'moms and babies' or 'moms and tots' parking bays. Not at all centres. But the point is that these parkings are for people who still need some extra space to wiggle the child out of the car seat and get out the pram. Stuff like that.\n\nSo to be fair, the disabled spots were all taken AND this woman didn't even seem to really qualify for the parking spot she was acting so entitled to.\n\nYou're NTA. Honestly, you probably qualified for that spot more than she did, anyways.\n\nTo top it all off, I will add that I have felt a tad guilty about taking the 'family parkings' before when I'm carrying my smaller baby in a wrap while putting my toddler in a shopping trolley toddler seat. Because then I don't have a pram to tag along. But honestly, I still have two tiny humans to haul with me, so actually it's okay. My point is just that this woman's entitlement to that spot just because she has a 6 y/o is beyond rude. If her child is fully capable of walking by themselves and getting out of the car on their own, there's really no reason why she needs that spot. It's not like having kids makes you so special all of a sudden that you just deserve special treatment compared to 'childless plebs'. Seriously!?", "Definitely NTA!!! People are so disrespectful for taking the handicapped places just because they\u2019re too lazy to walk maybe 20 feet more to the store.

I have used it if I am going to the mall and they are open but otherwise I park someplace else. I would rather have a pregnant mom or a person with a disability use these spots over me. I do agree that lady was out of line and good for the store employee standing up to her. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

I have only ever seen 2 used for Curbside.", "I was wondering about that - the app often either says something like \"park in spot \\[x\\]\" or \"select the spot you're in\". I imagine people who park in those spots are real AHs to store employees.", "Huh that\u2019s weird. I mostly visit the limbourg area and they seem to be very fairly common there. :)", "Yeah, a lot of places now mark them as family/ blue badges bays in the UK (certainly our local Sainsbury's has). \n\nThey're designed for families with children under 12 (which, possibly coincidentally, is the age where car seat/ booster seat rules change). OR someone with a blue badge.", "That's interesting. Where I live, they tend to be next to the handicap parking spots. Locally the pick up spots tend to be the closest of the row, but the in rows sort of far from the door.", "but the reason it's not okay for people without a blue badge to park in the disabled spaces is because it's illegal. it isn't illegal to park in the parent-and-baby spots even if you aren't a parent or a baby. so the logic of your first paragraph doesn't track.", "It is okay, however, for disabled people to use the parking spot they need when the disabled ones are full. Full stop.", "Not everyone has the ability to wait. Disabled people often only have so much energy before their bodies force them to stop moving.\n\nAnd she has a legal right to park in that courtesy spot.", "I fully agree. I\u2019ve also seen people parking in the double yellow lines next to a handicap spot which makes me irrationally mad. They don\u2019t get that the disabled person parked there might need that space to get into the vehicle.  Let alone that it is against the law.", "I have a disabled permit and don\u2019t use it if I don\u2019t need it that day. I feel guilty if I do!", "Fair enough. One of my local stores only has 2.", ">It is okay, however, for disabled people to use the parking spot they need when the disabled ones are full.\n\nCould you point out which law in OP's country specifies this?\n\nAlso, in OP's country, is this standard procedure?", "And not all parents have little infants with baby carriers. What's your point? I used an example of why someone might need a bigger parking space even if they're not disabled. Never said that those two are the *only* reasons", "I pointed out space around the spot as one of the reasons why a parent might benefit from using a special parking space. Not only.", "I know exactly how much it takes for a movement of a wheelchair. 1.5 meters minimum. A baby carrier (like the baby seat) in movement might take almost as much. And then there are strollers for laying infants (idk how they're called) And some parents have two or more kids. They might have a bigger stroller. Or they want to hold the other ones hand/have the other one close while they get baby in/out. You get the picture.\n\nNo, parents are not entitled to parking spaces for disabled people, but they can certainly benefit from them. From the additional space and from them being close to the entrance.", "Most of the US, most of Canada, lots of europe. It's Belgium - you can google it.\n\nRegardless, family spots are not legally protected. And OP needs that spot. Therefore, it's okay.", "Well I didn\u2019t say it isn\u2019t helpful for parents to have extra space, just the the needs of people with mobility issues go beyond extra loading/unloading space. So \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">Regardless, family spots are not legally protected.\n\nYou cannot possibly know that though without knowing where OP lives, which you do not. You are guessing legalities.", "For parents too. People say pregnancy isn't a disability, but it's not that far from one. Postpartum isn't easy on body either, regardless if you choose natural or c-section. Then you get to driving shoping cart and a stroller at the same time (how people do it idk) and then you have very lively little person who might run into traffic or request carrying in arms if the trip is too long.", "I do not disagree that pregnancy and many postpartum conditions are also disabilities requiring mobility accommodations. The context is children ~6yo and carseats, and expanding the discussion somewhat to strollers", "Its not expanding discussion to strollers. It's talking about reality of being a parent. It's not that you can pinpoint the exact moment when parent stops benefiting from these spaces. So yeah, one six year old might wait for mom to back out if there's not enough space, but another six year old can jump into trafic and can't get themselves into their car seat without help.\n\nAgain, accommodations for parents don't top disability accommodations, but they very often are veery simmilar or even the same."]}
