The woman's demand to have your car towed was insane.", "NTA - family parking or expecting mothers parking or \"employee of the month\" parking are all signs that are not legally enforcable.

I hate when people take up curbside pickup spots. That being said, i think its stupid to have them right outside the front doors of a store. Our local Walmart has them in the back outside a backdoor for employees only and that makes much more sense to me.

Many jurisdictions have additional protection for people who need accessible parking, including creating spots for people with disabilities on the street outside of their home. \n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act was controversial, but is truly a remarkable and phenomenal piece of legislation. I wish it had more protections for mental health, but making public spaces accessible to all people is truly one of the best things this country ever did.", "Anyone can park in those other spots.

No one got run over by an SUV. Actually no child I have ever known or even heard of has been run over in a parking lot. I became disabled later in life and now have a handicapped placard, for which I am very grateful. So I\u2019d say I have perspective on this issue, and OP was not in the wrong. \u201cFamily parking\u201d is neither required nor enforceable.

And I've actually never once used the family parking spots.  \n\n\nMy parents used them every time they brought my kids anywhere, but they have more trouble than I do wrangling them through the parking lot. I figure that's why they are there - for people who have issues getting their kids through the parking lot safely. That being said, if those spots weren't available, they did not care or complain. For MOST (because I know everyone's situation is obviously different), they are a convenience, not a necessity.  \n\n\nI would much rather someone with mobility issues use the spots than me just because I have kids. My kids and I get along just fine, why do we need the spot?  \n\n\nLady should have been trying to the cars parked in the disabled spot towed if she really felt like being angry and taking action.", "Yeah that's fair.
