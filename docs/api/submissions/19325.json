If your Dad had wanted HIS watch to go to whomever this person is, he could have easily just given it to them or designated that it pass to them in his will.

And they\u2019ve made it overwhelmingly clear that the only relationship they\u2019re interested in is entirely transactional.  Conditional.  Based on money and would last only as long as it took for them to clean you out and move on.  Don\u2019t fall for it.  \n\nAnd for the record:\n1.  NTA.  You deserve SO much better than these selfish, bigoted, money-grubbing people in your life, and they aren\u2019t entitled to or deserve a single penny of *your* money.\n2.

People tend to shut up when they have to talk to a lawyer instead of a relative they're trying to bully.", "And her too, at a tender, minor age. God, it seems like these \"family members\" would have been more happy if she was gone too, then they could get their greedy hands on everything. Don't do it OP. Your parents struggled to provide for *YOU*, to give *you* a better future and a chance at a good life, not your greedy so-called relatives who only care about knowing you when there is something to be unjustly gained (while they were ready to throw you to the wolves' before, figuratively speaking).", "I would still be cautious with your cousin. It could have been an accident, but her dad could be pressuring her now and even threatening her education. I'd be very worried if she brings it up again.", "Her education is not exactly dependant on her parents, she has a scholarship and a government grant to maintain herself, she still lives with her parents(normal here while in uni) but has been planning to move out for a while.", "Better to put some distance with your cousin for now, you don't know their family situation, in case they use your cousin to get to you. Take some time to observe their dynamic.", "YNTA.\nBut your family sure are.\nYou have no obligation to give any money or consideration to people who disowned your parents and you.\nTell those greedy animals to shove it.\nBlock them on everything.\nAnd if they keep harassing you, get a lawyer or the police involved and get a restraining order on them.\nEdit:\nYour cousins father sounds like an abusive animal. Give him nothing.\nMaybe call child protective services for his behavior.", "NTA! I also lost a parent young. So I think we all have that twisted sense of humor. I used to do all of the dad in a can jokes (he was cremated). \n\nThey don\u2019t deserve anything. They abandoned you at the worst point in your life. They aren\u2019t family. So how could your family belongings be theirs if they aren\u2019t family. \n\nHere is a tough thing to think about, but since you unfortunately had to go through this loss, it might be less of a problem to think about. I would recommend making a will and a living will (how to medically take care of you if something catastrophic happens). Unfortunately, we both know the worst can happen without any notice. Please don\u2019t let the people who hurt your parents inherit anything that they worked so hard for. \n\nMany hugs.", "NTA if they were entitled to anything they would have gotten it long ago.

For that one, if you want to extend an olive branch, you can scan it and send them a copy of it.  For everything else, they can suck it.  Block them and move on with your life.  Shame your cousin was the route they found you to harrass you but it does sound mostly unintentional.  If you want a family connection then you can try to keep something alive with her but if not, feel free to block her too.  Glad your classmate's family took you in when you were in a vulnerable position. I hope you build a great life!", "I wonder if it's possible to legally sever all legal relationships with these relatives.  Sort of like a child would apply for emancipation, or a spouse would apply for divorce. Surely there would be something similar... it might be worth talking to a lawyer to make absolutely sure that you have no legal obligations or responsibilties to any of the flock of vultures that you're related to.  With the one very notable excerption (the cousin.)\n\nYou're NTA. You owe none of them anything.  I find their claim that all inheritances are shared as being very suspicous... and you could always find out if any of your common relives passed away (grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc.) and ask them where your share of the inheritance is. The lot of them effectively disowned your parents and you, and in the same way that they did nothing for you, no don't have to do anything for them.  EVER.  And if you're thinking about giving them something smallish to get them off your back... it won't work.  Give them an inch, and they'll take the whole ruler.  Don't trust them. Don't trust them.  Better still, don't communicate them at all, except through a lawyer.", "Sorry for your loss friend.", "Your cousin needs what we call and information diet. Stop giving out information. The next step would be to get a lawyer.", "They belong to you because you are only family your parents have left.
