So where is your (and your parents\u2019 and brother\u2019s) shares of all the inheritances from the other \u201cfamily\u201d who have passed over the years of your lifetime, hmm?  \n\nAnd even if this is what *their* family does,  **they aren\u2019t your family**.  I mean, you share some DNA with them, but *that\u2019s it* - they spent your lifetime and some of your parents\u2019 lifetimes, too, making it abundantly clear that they aren\u2019t your family.\n\n>On my dad\u2019s side I have people demanding\u2026\n\nThey are in no position to demand a damn thing.  If your Dad had wanted HIS watch to go to whomever this person is, he could have easily just given it to them or designated that it pass to them in his will.  But he didn\u2019t do either of those things, did he?  And that\u2019s because he wanted *you* - the person he DID will it to - to have it.  That\u2019s what he actively chose to have happen.  And you should honor your dad\u2019s wishes.  \n\nListen OP, these people wanted less than zero to do with you right up until they found out about the money.  And that fact reveals them for exactly who they truly are - pathetic, opportunistic money-grubbers who are trying to scam a grieving daughter and sister out of *her* rightful inheritance money.  It\u2019s disgusting.  Don\u2019t let that happen.\n\nNo is a complete answer.  And if they won\u2019t stop bothering you about it, then block them.  And if they work around being blocked and *still* harass you, then hire an attorney to send Cease and Desist letters and investigate doing restraining orders (or whatever the equivalent might be in your locale, if it\u2019s different).\n\nAnd you might think to yourself, \u201cbut blocking them means giving up hope that we\u2019ll be able to build a relationship some day.\u201d  And yeah, that\u2019s sad, but you should believe people when they tell you who they are.  And they\u2019ve made it overwhelmingly clear that the only relationship they\u2019re interested in is entirely transactional.  Conditional.  Based on money and would last only as long as it took for them to clean you out and move on.  Don\u2019t fall for it.  \n\nAnd for the record:\n1.  NTA.  You deserve SO much better than these selfish, bigoted, money-grubbing people in your life, and they aren\u2019t entitled to or deserve a single penny of *your* money.\n2.  They\u2019re not your family, but you know who is?  All the wonderful memories of your late parents and brother, your foster family and BFF, and all the other warm, loving people you pick to be part of your chosen family over your lifetime.  THEY are your family.  Cherish THEM.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your losses. Unfortunately, you\u2019re learning your living biological relatives are more selfish than you believed. BLOCK THEM ALL!!!\n\nAlso, know that since they all left you in foster care, then they forfeit everything that is now yours! \n\nDON\u2019T GIVE THEM ANYTHING!!!", "Block them. If they keep attempting contact, consult an attorney about a cease and desist. None of the things, including the recipe book, was apparently important enough at the time your parents passed.

They knew that your parents died and were perfectly happy to abandon you. Why is it that only now that they have found out your are wealthy that they are claiming your things? If this was legitimate the watch and cookbook would have been claimed when you were alone with no one to care for you. \n\nNTA. Bear in mind your parents could have willed all these things to them had they wanted to. Everything that you inherited is rightly yours.", "DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE ANYTHING.\n\nYou know how poorly they treated your parents.  You know how poorly they treated you.\n\nYou are only getting these requests because they know how to contact because you  and your causing reconnected.\n\nThey are not owed anything.\n\nTheir claim that inheritances are shared could be sound suspicious to me.\n\nYou have a good head on your shoulders.\n\nit all BELONGS TO YOU, not them.\n\nIf they wants the beloved recipe book why didn't they make up with your parents?\n\nYou deserve the heirlooms as much as anyone else, actually more so as they were your prints possessions.  Why should they get them?\n\nDO NOT GIVE THE ANYTHING.  NTA.\n\nBlock them, Go NC.", "NTA", "NTA. Not a chance. Not now, not ever. Give them what they gave you: nothing.", "NTA tho the only thing I\u2019d reasonably give back in ONLY the watch.. and purely for the tradition.. because I personally wouldn\u2019t want to have that on my heart.. on my head.. on my future kids\u2026 or anyone else in the world\u2026 stuff like that with carry bad karma when people like this get involved\u2026 it\u2019s better to just send it back and let them have their karma from there\u2026 or get an appraisal and offer buy backs\u2026 sounds shitty to sell their dead family members stuff back to them\u2026 however they didn\u2019t want any of it until now\u2026 if it means enough they\u2019d be willing to pay for what they want from you and cut ties from there\u2026\nBut again NTA\u2026 the only reason I say bargain the heirlooms or traditional pieces is im one that wouldn\u2019t want to carry the karma that comes with those pieces and the bad vibes the family is putting on them\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
