I refer to my dad as \u2018my dad\u2019 when talking to my siblings sometimes, and we have the same parents.

Also has no bloody right to email your therapist", "Nta. Yeah, your mom needs the therapist more. Your relationship with your father is just that, yours.

This seems like a perfectly normal speech pattern to me. Wth else are you supposed to say? I'm wrapping a present for \"John?\" I'm wrapping a present for Dad? For father? They all seem equally valid to me. Well, the first name might be disrespectful in some families. I mean, he is *your* dad. NTA, and if there's the slightest chance your therapist could possibly be influenced by your mother, get a different one and don't give her a name, clinic, number, nothing.", "NTA. Refer to your dad as whatever you want, you didn't do anything wrong here. Also, why does your mother have your therapist's email address, or even know who your therapist is? You're nearly 30! Unless you've been seeing the same therapist since you were a child, it is time to put your mom on an information diet. She does not need that level of detail about your life. Her behavior is extremely inappropriate. You need some boundaries here, stat! \n\nStart with removing her ability to just walk into your apartment at-will. She can knock or ring the bell like everyone else. Stop giving her details of your life that she doesn't need to know and that she can weaponize.

Hasn't your therapist ever heard of patient confidentiality?", "Well I don't know what happened there. Is the mom paying for the therapist? I don't think therapists are supposed be paid to be told what to tell their patients. I would hope the next session would be like \"so your mom seems to be a bit of a cunt, how does that make you feel?\"", "Thought someone replied to this...when I was in clinical psych classes a therapists relationship with their client/participant was 100% no one else's business unless lives were at stake. Family types of therapy are differently structured, and no clue on them.", "That was my first thought - mom is the one who needs a therapist.\n\nOP, you didn't do anything wrong. Your mom is blowing up over absolutely nothing... unless you are leaving something relevant out. But, honestly, I can't think of ANY reason for anyone to blow up over you saying \"my dad\" instead of \"dad\" to your mom. For myself, yeah, I generally refer to my parents as \"mom\" and \"dad\" when speaking to one of them about the other. However, there isn't anything abhorrent about throwing a \"my\" in front of it.\n\nAlso - and this might be where I am the asshole - it sounds like your mom *is* an outsider to a big part of your family. And that is her own problem that she needs to learn to deal with without blaming you.", "I vaguely understand the mother but it's rather difficult to even put into words. But let me try.\n\nI think they key here is the second paragraph of the OP. The mother has been cut out of the family. She has probably(???) been subjected to things like 'my son's ex' or similar verbiage and phrases like 'My Daughter in Law' or even 'My Daughter' have been entirely retired. \n\nSo by using 'My Dad', it creates an impression (justified or not) that OP is creating a barrier between Mother and the rest of the family. 'My Dad' could be interpreted as not only possessive but also denying the relationship that previously existed between parents, that this is HER dad and the Mother does not exist within that framework. \n\nI'm not sure that really gets my idea across and I don't even know if that's the issue at hand. But AITA is all about boogeymen and making shit up with our imagination so wtf amirite?", "Op does sound a little odd here. You'd say \"I was just talking to my dad.\" To someone who doesn't know them. Usually if you're talking to a close family member, you'd drop the 'my'. \"Hey mom, do you know when dad is getting back. \"", "Lolol. Brilliant !", "I appreciate your comment. That makes a little more sense, not much, but I understand what you\u2019re saying. I just feel like the mom created that barrier herself when she cheated causing the domino effect we now see.", ">when she cheated\n\nShe did what now?", "I don\u2019t know how to show the quote.

(Genuinely asking, not being rude.)", "It's not unusual. I've heard it many times.", "I've only heard it as removing oneself from a relationship. \n\nYour knowledge of the term is as valid as mine. Redditors are from around the world and the same words have different meanings. I'm happy to expand my knowledge so thank you for contributing.", "NTA\u2026 He is, in fact, your Dad.

Why does your mom have your therapist's contact?", "This is controlling beyond comprehension.", "Wow.  Somebody here needs therapy, but I don't think it's you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, however I can sympathise with her as this used to happen to me ALL the time.  My mother clearly had a favourite child (my brother, let's call him John), and would often refer to him as \"my son\" in conversations between just the two of us.  I would ask why she could not just say \"John\" and she would answer 'because he is my son'.  Well what the hell am I to you?  I would be left feeling excluded by the fact that she would use this terminology with me, who is supposedly part of her family unit.\n\nI feel like when you are part of a unit, you just refer to the people by their name, as they have relations to both of you.\n\nYou wouldn't state the relationship within a friend group e.g. \"I am wrapping this present for my friend Nancy\" to someone who is also her friend.  That would make them think \"am I not her friend as well?\"\n\nI know I am not explaining this well, but I felt hurt/excluded and so may your mum", "NTA. So, in Spanish I'm always saying  \"mi mam\u00e1\" or \"mi pap\u00e1,\" and when I speak English I just automatically say \"my mom\" \"my dad\". I didn't notice I was doing it until an ex-BF asked me about it once and I realized it's a thing I do when speaking English. \n\nAnyway, long way of saying, you call your dad whatever you want.", "I would be emailing some pointers to her therapist... \n\nNTA Op.", "I know I am not explaining this well, but I felt hurt/excluded and so may your mum", "She did what now?", "It\u2019s not about the word dad. It\u2019s about how it sounds like mom doesn\u2019t know her dad. \u201eI\u2019m wrapping a gift for my dad\u201c is totally different than \u201eI\u2019m wrapping a gift for dad\u201c", "Looks like ops mum and dad are not together.
