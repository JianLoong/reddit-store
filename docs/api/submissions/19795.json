Refer to your dad as whatever you want, you didn't do anything wrong here. Also, why does your mother have your therapist's email address, or even know who your therapist is? You're nearly 30!

Her behavior is extremely inappropriate. You need some boundaries here, stat! \n\nStart with removing her ability to just walk into your apartment at-will.

Your mom is blowing up over absolutely nothing... unless you are leaving something relevant out. But, honestly, I can't think of ANY reason for anyone to blow up over you saying \"my dad\" instead of \"dad\" to your mom. For myself, yeah, I generally refer to my parents as \"mom\" and \"dad\" when speaking to one of them about the other. However, there isn't anything abhorrent about throwing a \"my\" in front of it.\n\nAlso - and this might be where I am the asshole - it sounds like your mom *is* an outsider to a big part of your family.

But let me try.\n\nI think they key here is the second paragraph of the OP. The mother has been cut out of the family. She has probably(???) been subjected to things like 'my son's ex' or similar verbiage and phrases like 'My Daughter in Law' or even 'My Daughter' have been entirely retired. \n\nSo by using 'My Dad', it creates an impression (justified or not) that OP is creating a barrier between Mother and the rest of the family. 'My Dad' could be interpreted as not only possessive but also denying the relationship that previously existed between parents, that this is HER dad and the Mother does not exist within that framework. \n\nI'm not sure that really gets my idea across and I don't even know if that's the issue at hand. But AITA is all about boogeymen and making shit up with our imagination so wtf amirite?", "Op does sound a little odd here.

I would ask why she could not just say \"John\" and she would answer 'because he is my son'.  Well what the hell am I to you?  I would be left feeling excluded by the fact that she would use this terminology with me, who is supposedly part of her family unit.\n\nI feel like when you are part of a unit, you just refer to the people by their name, as they have relations to both of you.\n\nYou wouldn't state the relationship within a friend group e.g. \"I am wrapping this present for my friend Nancy\" to someone who is also her friend.
