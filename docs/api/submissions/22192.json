You clearly treat them as second class burdens and want to push them out, don\u2019t be confused when they refuse to \u2018babysit\u2019 the kids you care about.

Presumably for the first 6 months or so the baby will be sleeping in your and your husband's room in any event.\n\nIt also sounds as though this could have been managed way better - the twins are 17, why did you not have a conversation involving them and your husband to talk about options and ask what they thought / suggested?  It's possible that if it had been approached differently they might have been happy to move and have a bit more of their own space. It's also not clear what the basement is like - to it a properly finished room or a is it the space where the washers live and not really set up to be occupied? What plans do you have for redecorating or improvising it if it now needs to be used as a bedroom? \n\nFor instance, an alternative option might be for you and your husband to move down their with the new baby, let the twins each have their own room , but talk to them about how that might mean that they get disturbed by Layla. r you could have one room for Layla and the baby, one for you and your husband, and one for the twins, which doesn't isolate anyone, but also plan to improve the basement so it can be used as living space and maybe offer the twins the change to create their own space", "Congratulations on winning \u201cStereotypical evil stepmother\u201d cosplay competition \ud83c\udfc6\n\nPrizes include years worth of therapy, siblings rivalry and future marriage issues: when your husband finally gets his head out of its current not be named location and figure out why his kids don\u2019t want to talk  to him anymore. \n\nYTA", "YTA.

You tried to look after the wellbeing of your biological children without considering the wellbeing of your stepchildren.\n\nI would also move out ASAP if this is how you treat your stepkids, too. Posts like these make me so thankful my stepdad never treated me anything less than his own blood.\n\nYou're also the AH for making two teens of the opposite gender share a room. At that age, they need much more privacy than you've afforded.

Unless that basement is fully renovated and just needs a good cleaning, your stepkids shouldn't be expected to move down there.

If the twins are different genders, I'd kind of argue that they should be having separate rooms for their privacy as adolescents by this point in their lives rather than you expecting them to share?\n\nEither way, YTA. You (and your husband) could have approached this so nicely with them, remodelling the basement with them to make a really super space for them to hang out, offering them to have the chance to make it their own, giving them a budget to make it awesome, asking for their input so that they didn't feel excluded and de-prioritised (again). At 17 years old, you should have involved them, not told them.\n\nBut that's not really the point, the point is that you're constantly putting everything above them - and you then expect them not to resent you and your children? Get a clue.\n\n>All I tried to do was think about my children and their well being, so AITAH?\n\nNews flash: when you married their father, the twins became your children too. There's no evidence in your post at all that you've spent one second thinking about their well-being, just those of your biological children. In fact, you're giving out some serious Cinderella wicked stepmother vibes and it's mad that when you re-read when you posted here, you didn't realise that for yourself. All you seem to do when they do something you don't like is run to their father and complain about them, making him discipline them. You're not even dealing with the issue yourself, so why would you think everything was 'settled.'\n\nYou've mentioned that the upstairs rooms are all good sizes, couldn't one of them be split into two rooms for your 2YO and your baby, if you're so keen for them to have their own spaces? They don't need big spaces.\n\nI'm sorry but it is so upsetting how clearly unfeeling you are to your step-children. Perhaps there is a backstory that contains lots of evidence of you spoiling and loving them unconditionally, but as your default reaction to the confrontation was to tell them they always ruin everything, it seems unlikely. I can't imagine that this post is going to end well for you here, and I hope it encourages you to look inside and be better. The twins, and your own children, deserve that from you.", "Yup Yta you should give the twins your room and move to the basement", "Yup YTA, both you and your husband, but don't worry, neither of you will need to worry about the twins soon, they will leave and you will never hear from them again.

As you mentioned, all you are thinking about the well being of *your* children, and you think it is fair that  the 3 year old and the newborn get the big bedrooms, and the 17 year old twins get whatever is left over, because the twins are not your children and therefore are second class citizens in their own house.", "YTA holy shit woman", "YTA\n\nFor blatantly favoring your own biological kids.

What the hell are you playing at crying and yelling and running off to tell on them to the only adult in the house - the one you have wrapped around your spoiled little finger.

Maybe even sooner if they decide they didn't want anything to do with the new sibling. \n\nJust to make this clear, what you SHOULD have done is sitting them down, tell them you think about another baby and what they think of getting the basement (you!! oc are gonna prepare for them before or during early pregnancy) or if they want to keep their bedroom till they go to college and you guys wait another year or two with the next child (and then you will prepare the basement for when they come back for holidays since they will have more privacy there anyway).", "YTA, the twins sharing made some sense, but why can't your kids share?

(All of the names are fake.)\n\nI 34 f have been married to my husband 'Jake' 49 for three years. We have one daughter 'Lyla' 2 together and I'm currently pregnant with our second child. My husband has twins who are 17 'Collin' and 'Cheryl' from his previous marriage.\n\nFor the background: We live in a house that has a big basement, and three big bedrooms. \nWhen Lyla was born I suggested that Cheryl and Collin would share a bedroom since they both were the same age and get along super well. They are always together and share a friend group, so i thought I wouldn't be a big deal. The room that would be left would become Lyla's. This broke a hell loose. Neither of them wanted to give up their room and we fought over a lot over this topic. Luckily after my husband talked with them they eventually agreed.\n\nNow I'm pregnant with my second child and thought that it would be better if the twins would move the basement. That way the new baby could have their old room and it would be easier to take care of them, when both of my children's rooms would be close to my and my husbands bedroom.\nThe only problem with the basement is that it's really isolated from the rest of the house, and it's a little bit dirty. But it's still bigger than the bedrooms, so the twins will not have trouble with space.\n\nHowever when the twins heard my suggestion they were livid. They cussed me out for always doing everything at their expense and accused me of trying to isolate them from the rest of the family. I started to cry and yelled at them for being selfish and trying to always ruin everything. Then I went to tell my husband what happened, and he talked to them once again. Jake made them apologize to me and as a punishment for being rude we told them to start cleaning the basement.\n\nYesterday I was doing laundry and needed to get something from the basement. The twins were cleaning the basement and they were complaining and bad mouthing about me while cleaning. They called me a bit*h and a dictator who can't do compromisses at all. Most shocking thing were how they basically agreed to get out of our house as soon as possible because of me.\n\nI thought things were settled between us but, it seems it's not. All I tried to do was think about my children and their well being, so AITAH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're the very definition of evil stepmother. They should NOT have shared a room. They should NOT move. They SHOULD have their own rooms. How disgusting of you. Stop getting pregnant. If the basement is so lovely, make the babies share your current room and you can move down to the bas3ment. Otherwise, move. Alternatively stop getting pregnant. You do NOT have the space for more kids ffs.", "INFO: why don't you move there in then? For such a nice finished space? \nYTA. I would have been ashamed to have you as mother, much less a step mother. You are not just a bit*h and dictator, you're a manipulator, vindictive, leech who takes advantage of two minors helplessness. Your husband is an even bigger raging asshole, also a spineless coward. They would be happy when they're out. And you two are match made in heaven and deserve to build a nasty life together."]}
