You should be able to tell him that you have a list of to-do's that need attention. Did you tell hin what you were facing? He should be able to get off the couch for food.", "NTA. Wow, how lazy and entitled can one person be?! Is that how you want the rest of your life to go!?", "NTA  \nIs he doing his fair share of chores otherwise? If not I would consider if you want to marry him.", "NTA and you know it. \n\nYour partner has legs, the time and he was the one that ordered the food. It's his responsibility. You could've told him that you'd go get it if he mailed you wedding invites.", "NTA. Why couldn\u2019t he go get it..?", "Easy nta. Especially if he knew you had a lot on your plate today.", "NTA\n\nHe was being lazy. Why should you have to do what he doesn't feel like doing? That shows he thinks you are beneath him.", "Does he have arms? Legs? Unless he\u2019s literally a snake who would have to pick the food up with his fangs and slither up the stairs with it, NTA.", "You are NTA \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 sounds lazy - and maybe it is time for some counselling (pre-marital and individual). Was there any physical reason why he could not get it himself? As for being snippy, it is still his fault - he knew you were very busy with a lot on your plate, yet he still tried to add more to your plate. Maybe you can work through with a counsellor with regards to why you are in a relationship with him - is he really a partner, or does he see you more as a servant? Because if it is the latter.... you are going to have a very long road ahead.", "NTA. All he has to do is meet the delivery person?!", "NTA  Fiance is TA.  Why shouldn't you be snippy to an AH that won't get up to get his own food?  Meanwhile, you are working!", "NTA. Work comes first ESPECIALLY if you\u2019re prepping for a meeting/presentation. \n\nSo he\u2019s pissed that he had to get off the couch to go downstairs to get his food and he\u2019s pissed at you? Sounds *super mature* \n\nHowever is it possible that you both are stressed about your upcoming wedding and the never ending to do list?  And that this bickering is both of you being reactive?", "NTA - WTF he ordered breakfast then called from another room when he wasn't working to get you to go pay for the delivered breakfast downstairs?\n\nIf this is what he is like before you marry him, how much worse can it get?\n\nhow lazy do you have to be to not want to make breakfast for 1 (I presume he never cooks for 2)?\n\nno man is better than this excuse for a man", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are working, he is sitting on his entitled ass watching TV, and he expected you to take time off work to walk down a flight of stairs to get *HIS* food.

And, if he has the day off with nothing to do, why couldn't *he* mail the wedding invitations?", "That is a flimsy excuse from him - unless if he has not bathed in weeks, he just needed to throw some shorts and a t-shirt on, pop downstairs to collect the delivery, and come back up the stairs.
