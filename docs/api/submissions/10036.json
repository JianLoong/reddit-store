My 27f grandmother died 4 years ago, when she got engaged to my grandfather he gave her a 21ct gold ring with diamonds and a ruby in the center. That ring was eventually passed to my dad when he was ready to propose to my mum. As far as I know she never took the ring off and the ring was returned to my dad when my mum passed.\n\nRecently me and my partner of three years have been talking about getting engaged. I asked my dad about the ring and he agreed if I ever got engaged I would inherit the ring. Well last night I told my boyfriend about the ring and how it was passed on. He said his daughter who is from a previous  relationship would love to inherit it eventually. I explained that she wouldn't be getting the ring since she's not my daughter, that if my baby (11months) wants it when she's older that she will inherit it.\n\nThis caused a massive argument, in which my partner called me a bitch and said I was treating his daughter differently because she's not blood. Things might be different if I actually had a relationship with her but I don't. I've only met her once in person and honestly don't know her that well. She has no attachment to the ring, but my daughter will since it'll be her grandmothers and great grandmothers ring.\n\nI made a point of saying to him if he proposed to me with it, I'd return it to my dad for safe keeping. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1676482162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1133gjg/aita_for_not_wanting_my_stepdaughter_to_have_my/", "score": 2240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My 27f grandmother died 4 years ago, when she got engaged to my grandfather he gave her a 21ct gold ring with diamonds and a ruby in the center. That ring was eventually passed to my dad when he was ready to propose to my mum. As far as I know she never took the ring off and the ring was returned to my dad when my mum passed.\n\nRecently me and my partner of three years have been talking about getting engaged. I asked my dad about the ring and he agreed if I ever got engaged I would inherit the ring. Well last night I told my boyfriend about the ring and how it was passed on. He said his daughter who is from a previous  relationship would love to inherit it eventually. I explained that she wouldn't be getting the ring since she's not my daughter, that if my baby (11months) wants it when she's older that she will inherit it.\n\nThis caused a massive argument, in which my partner called me a bitch and said I was treating his daughter differently because she's not blood. Things might be different if I actually had a relationship with her but I don't. I've only met her once in person and honestly don't know her that well. She has no attachment to the ring, but my daughter will since it'll be her grandmothers and great grandmothers ring.\n\nI made a point of saying to him if he proposed to me with it, I'd return it to my dad for safe keeping. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Every generation in my family does this, we are really sentimental.  We also have a number of precious antiques and belongings that are worth a lot of money that others would want to sell. Each of these important personal belongings or heirlooms have a special history to us.  Some things are sentimental aren\u2019t to the next generation and that\u2019s fine. passing a heirloom isn\u2019t mandatory to keep in the family. once an item belongs to them, is up to them do what they want with it.

Subtle abuse that's easily excuses as \" I'm sorry, I had a bad day\" type of stuff till you're uses to it and further in the relationship. Then after you're married,and they've usually cut you off from friends and family in one way or another, and they have you completely dependent and or have your self esteem so low you're convinced they're the only one that will ever love you the abuse gets worse.
