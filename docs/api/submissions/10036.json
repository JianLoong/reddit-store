My 27f grandmother died 4 years ago, when she got engaged to my grandfather he gave her a 21ct gold ring with diamonds and a ruby in the center. That ring was eventually passed to my dad when he was ready to propose to my mum. As far as I know she never took the ring off and the ring was returned to my dad when my mum passed.\n\nRecently me and my partner of three years have been talking about getting engaged. I asked my dad about the ring and he agreed if I ever got engaged I would inherit the ring. Well last night I told my boyfriend about the ring and how it was passed on. He said his daughter who is from a previous  relationship would love to inherit it eventually. I explained that she wouldn't be getting the ring since she's not my daughter, that if my baby (11months) wants it when she's older that she will inherit it.\n\nThis caused a massive argument, in which my partner called me a bitch and said I was treating his daughter differently because she's not blood. Things might be different if I actually had a relationship with her but I don't. I've only met her once in person and honestly don't know her that well. She has no attachment to the ring, but my daughter will since it'll be her grandmothers and great grandmothers ring.\n\nI made a point of saying to him if he proposed to me with it, I'd return it to my dad for safe keeping. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1676482162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1133gjg/aita_for_not_wanting_my_stepdaughter_to_have_my/", "score": 519, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My 27f grandmother died 4 years ago, when she got engaged to my grandfather he gave her a 21ct gold ring with diamonds and a ruby in the center. That ring was eventually passed to my dad when he was ready to propose to my mum. As far as I know she never took the ring off and the ring was returned to my dad when my mum passed.\n\nRecently me and my partner of three years have been talking about getting engaged. I asked my dad about the ring and he agreed if I ever got engaged I would inherit the ring. Well last night I told my boyfriend about the ring and how it was passed on. He said his daughter who is from a previous  relationship would love to inherit it eventually. I explained that she wouldn't be getting the ring since she's not my daughter, that if my baby (11months) wants it when she's older that she will inherit it.\n\nThis caused a massive argument, in which my partner called me a bitch and said I was treating his daughter differently because she's not blood. Things might be different if I actually had a relationship with her but I don't. I've only met her once in person and honestly don't know her that well. She has no attachment to the ring, but my daughter will since it'll be her grandmothers and great grandmothers ring.\n\nI made a point of saying to him if he proposed to me with it, I'd return it to my dad for safe keeping. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The grandfather wanted it only to be passed down to blood family after the rest of his family was killed due to their ethnicity.

The 'father' can by her one.", "Adoptee here. My experience is this : \n\nNo interest in finding bio family or any full/half-siblings. Raised as an only child. No emotional ties to bio family.

They didn\u2019t raise me. Dad did. The lessons and memories I have are the foundation of my life I\u2019ve got stuff I\u2019ve inherited from him.

A 10 year-old is too young to be thinking about something that expensive and it may be a non-issue later. A lot can happen between now and the time in the future when it's passed on to the new generation.\n\nI'm more concerned by your Fiance's behavior, He's acting like it's his property to give away to fit his ideas and if he doesn't get his way he acts like he did. Be wary of this man.", "How old is your boyfriend?", "Simple!\n\nThe ring is something that is passed down when a person is ready to marry. It the child is young, it's too early to think about it. In this case the child is 10 and far from getting married.", "Then NTA absolutely. You have no relationship with the girl, there's no reason to pass on your ring to someone you barely know. It'd be one thing if she was in your life constantly and she didn't have a mother because then in getting married to her dad you'd be taking her as your child too, but that's not the situation here.

Ya both are being hella weird about this. \n\nAnd you have no idea what your relationship with your POTENTIAL step kid will be... And these kids supposedly are going to grow up together for the entirety of your POTENTIAL marriage. \n\nIt's absolutely nonsensical to be having this fight.", "Hell no.

Not to mention that step-kid had a mother and grandmother who may have heirlooms that almost certainly won't go to OP's kids.", "TBH I'm not sure, if it was the step-dad or her mother.

You are having a conversation with him about nostalgia and getting engaged with a family ring and he IMMEDIATELY goes to his daughter ultimately getting the ring?????   I'm sorry but who does this?  What happened to his daughter with you getting  a family ring.  Sounds like he wants to play \"big shot\" with his daughter by giving her a ruby/diamond ring.  Then he calls you a \"bitch\".  OP, you have a self-centered fiancee who feels entitled to dictate who receives YOUR family ring.", "I'd be worried about him telling his 10-year-old daughter that one day she'll get this lovely family heirloom to use for her engagement ring. She easily could grow up expecting to get it, only to have her hopes dashed when OP has to clarify it was never the father's to offer. We see situations like this all the time on AITA where promised family heirlooms are not received as expected.

If he\u2019s calling you a bitch, what do you think he called his ex ?", "every other weekend un supervised visits if his ex doesn't cancel.", "Agree. Sounds like he's happy with the current agreement and lack of involvement in his child's life. Why wound the child's step dad be the one dictating custody? They have a literal child together this is a random GF of a couple of weeks.", "\nYeah I was only saying because OP said she wants it to go to her daughter at least for now. The bf is being super weird about it, I'm sure he wouldn't want a family heirloom of his being given away like how he's expecting it from OP.", "Is it a formal agreement? Where do they spend the weekend? If you don\u2019t all live together, he should be inviting you over to spend time with his daughter. If ex backs out, he should take her back to court. Your boyfriend sounds like a deadbeat Dad.", "Depending on exactly how the paperwork is written and in the vast majority of cases the custodial parent can\u2019t cancel the non custodial parent\u2019s visitation. It would be a violation of the court order and the custodial parent would be held in contempt.\n\nI would really look into the paperwork and if there isn\u2019t paperwork then that\u2019s kinda a red flag in and of itself.\n\nNot trying to be mean but if the guy wanted to be in his daughter\u2019s life he would be.", "WAIT!\n\nYou say his ex cancels his visitation?\n\nIt sound like she is using parental alienation tactics here. If she has the power to cancel a visit like that and he has no say in the matter is a huge alarm bell.\n\nIt sounds like he needs to go to court and get his visitation \"set in stone\" so that he can have his visitations without interference from her.", "then why the comment about a \u201cstranger in their space\u201d?  He can just have you meet at his house", "Ex doesn\u2019t get to cancel. If it is court ordered time, he gets it. What this actually sounds like is he doesn\u2019t care enough to fight for a relationship with his child. \n\n\u2026 and if he won\u2019t fight for time and a relationship with his child, why in the world would it be ok for him to call you a bitch and demand a family heirloom from YOUR family for this child?! \n\nPlease tell me you see how absolutely deranged this all is.", "God, he sounds awful! Thats exactly what i took from it. I hope op realises, and quick."]}
