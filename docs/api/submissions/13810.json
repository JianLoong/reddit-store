It was at the end of March and we were going to be sleeping in a tent. There was a few other girls there as well and we would all be sharing the tent. Keep in mind it's a very big tent.\n\nWhen we were setting up the air mattresses everyone was planning where they were going to sleep. We had 3 individual ones and a massive one that could fit multiple people. 5 people were going to sleep on the big air mattress with someone else on an individual one beside them on the right side and on the left side there was 3 people sharing 2 beds.\n\nWhen I realised I didn't have anywhere to sleep I asked them what I was going to do they all paused and then made up some response like \"Oh I don't know where ever you want I suppose\"\n\nThis meant I ended up lying on the floor of the tent with nothing but a thin duvet under me and an ever thinner blanket over me. I wasn't having a good time while everyone else was laughing.\n\nAt around 1am I called my mom who got a taxi to take me home. When the taxi was about 10 minutes away I told everyone I was leaving and started to pack my stuff into my bag. Nobody said anything for a second but then they all started offering solutions to where I could sleep, however before I said I was leaving they were all fine with letting me sleep on the floor despite the fact I'd already told them how uncomfortable I was.\n\nI finally left at half 1 and got home around 2am. That morning I woke up to a text from the host saying that she understood why I left but that I had been selfish after she did so much to make me more comfortable as in she gave me a duvet and offered to let me sleep inside instead of the tent. At this point I still haven't responded to her message, but someone else from the sleepover texted me (let's call her M).\n\nM messaged me to ask if I was alright and I said yeah I was and then explained why I left. After that M immediately started saying that I could've slept inside but refused or I could've brought more stuff for myself. I just ignored her then.\n\nHalf an hour after that another one of my friends messaged me saying that everyone was uncomfortable in the tent but it wasn't that bad. I haven't responded to this either. I know that they were still together when all of those messages were sent so it feels very coordinated.\n\nI spoke to my dad about it what they said and he told me that I did the right thing by leaving but M keeps occasionally sending me texts asking if I've responded to the first text that the host of the sleepover sent.\n\nI'm not sure what to do or say because I'll have to see them tomorrow away and I can't leave them on read for forever.", "created_utc": 1680442742, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129lku0/aita_for_leaving_a_sleepover_in_the_middle_of_the/", "score": 300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure if the other girls were dismissing you, picking on you or just were rude out of selfish ignorance.\n\nI'm also not sure why you huddled on the had ground for hours before packing your bags and departing into the night.  5 ppl in one bed, 3 in another, at the very beginning you should have laughed and dogpiled in too.\n\nI think you spent a lot time without addressing this then packed your bags and left it was for drama and affect and a lot of this is you being disappointed/embarrassed you how poorly you came off.\n\nNow they're texting you one at a time.  They are all together and I agree this seems coordinated.  I can't tell if they are doing this because they feel bad and are trying to fix it or if it's a sneakier thing.\n\nI'm not sure why teens think you can't leave some on read.  They know you read the message and have chosen not to reply.  You have sent a message my dear.\n\nI would text one person--either the hostess or if one of those girls is someone you actually like.

They sound like really crummy people who are just angry that you have enough respect for yourself to make and stick to boundaries.  \n\nThey knew how many people were going to be over vs how many air mattress spots there were.

Somehow A-holes always circle around kind, empathetic people because they know they can slowly suck the life out of them. You deserve friends. Real friends.

They're not your friends.", "NTA", "NTA", "nta", "You did the right thing. It was only a priority for them when they realized that you were calling them out. It was inconsiderate of the host to not have a place for everyone to sleep. She should have asked people to bring extra bedding or mattresses. Sleeping inside alone is as isolating as being the only one who had to sleep on the ground. You don\u2019t have to explain anything to them. They already know, and if they try to argue it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to accept that it was their fault.", "NTA kids and teens suck and they are trying to find the peeking order. They tried to make you at the bottom and after you said no I will not be treated this way they are trying to make it like you over reacted. You did the right thing. Don\u2019t let your friends treat you like an after thought. It will happen naturally but try to find your true friends and stick with them.", "NTA. As the mother of a 15 year old daughter, I can't help but feel proud of you for leaving. You refused to feel uncomfortable and excluded and you handled it with tact and maturity. \n\nAlso, leave them on read. It will speak volumes more than any response you give.", "NTA and you can absolutely leave them on read for ever. Maybe start hanging out with some new people.", "NTA leave them on read. If you reply whatever you reply with, they will tear to pieces. But leave on read? Oh, there is no better reply than that.", "NTA\n\nJust send individual text to everyone saying \"Thanks, I'm good. Had a great time last night\"\n\nAnd watch their reactions tomorrow. You can tell the shady ones by their reactions. \n\nAnd if they ask you why it took so long to answer... watching a movie with mom/dad, toke a nap, went out to the store with mom/dad and forgot my phone.. your young you can make up a lie!!!\n\nI may not be 16 anymore but shady little girls don't change. Don't trust these girls anymore. You can stay cool with them but keep them at arms length. They have showed their true colors and they will turn on you. So only keep them as friends if you need to.", "Don't let them guilt trip you for their lack of consideration. As you said, they only offered solutions when they saw you were leaving. They are more worried about how this will look on their part than for you. Trust me, been in similar situations at a similar age. Groups of friends always have one or two people that they don't actually want there, but they need them for whatevrt reason (most times to make split costs cheaper). It sucks realizing it and it may happen again later in your life with other social groups you make or encounter. The key is getting to recognize when you're just a disposable prop to them or if they are all genuinely good friends that care for you as much as you care for them.", "First thing I thought was oh yes you can. And if they try to talk to you when you do see them \u201ckeep \u2018me on read\u201d then too.", "This is something I wish I learned earlier in life. If a situation makes you uncomfortable, remove yourself from it. Easy as that. \n\nBoring conversation? Don\u2019t force it. Later!\n\nAwkward situation? Peace out!", "Yes, poor planning by the host for sure.  NTA", "Tents can be very comfortable but it really depends on how well equipped the tent is.  A nice air mattress, pillows and blankets can make for a lovely night.", "You would dictate where 15 year olds would sleep?", "Good question.", "And suggesting she brought more for herself??? But the arrangements hadn\u2019t been decided until everyone arrived???\nNTA.", "Damn autocorrect keep \u2018em on read", "This made me lol too", "You definitely need to drop these friends. Or at least make it clear that this treatment is not ok.", "They sound like really bad people who are just angry that you have enough self-respect and stick to boundaries", "She said she told them she was uncomfortable. They didn't care. She made the right decision.", "This! \u2b06\ufe0f"]}
