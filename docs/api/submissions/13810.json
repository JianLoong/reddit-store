It was at the end of March and we were going to be sleeping in a tent. There was a few other girls there as well and we would all be sharing the tent. Keep in mind it's a very big tent.\n\nWhen we were setting up the air mattresses everyone was planning where they were going to sleep. We had 3 individual ones and a massive one that could fit multiple people. 5 people were going to sleep on the big air mattress with someone else on an individual one beside them on the right side and on the left side there was 3 people sharing 2 beds.\n\nWhen I realised I didn't have anywhere to sleep I asked them what I was going to do they all paused and then made up some response like \"Oh I don't know where ever you want I suppose\"\n\nThis meant I ended up lying on the floor of the tent with nothing but a thin duvet under me and an ever thinner blanket over me. I wasn't having a good time while everyone else was laughing.\n\nAt around 1am I called my mom who got a taxi to take me home. When the taxi was about 10 minutes away I told everyone I was leaving and started to pack my stuff into my bag. Nobody said anything for a second but then they all started offering solutions to where I could sleep, however before I said I was leaving they were all fine with letting me sleep on the floor despite the fact I'd already told them how uncomfortable I was.\n\nI finally left at half 1 and got home around 2am. That morning I woke up to a text from the host saying that she understood why I left but that I had been selfish after she did so much to make me more comfortable as in she gave me a duvet and offered to let me sleep inside instead of the tent. At this point I still haven't responded to her message, but someone else from the sleepover texted me (let's call her M).\n\nM messaged me to ask if I was alright and I said yeah I was and then explained why I left. After that M immediately started saying that I could've slept inside but refused or I could've brought more stuff for myself. I just ignored her then.\n\nHalf an hour after that another one of my friends messaged me saying that everyone was uncomfortable in the tent but it wasn't that bad. I haven't responded to this either. I know that they were still together when all of those messages were sent so it feels very coordinated.\n\nI spoke to my dad about it what they said and he told me that I did the right thing by leaving but M keeps occasionally sending me texts asking if I've responded to the first text that the host of the sleepover sent.\n\nI'm not sure what to do or say because I'll have to see them tomorrow away and I can't leave them on read for forever.", "created_utc": 1680442742, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129lku0/aita_for_leaving_a_sleepover_in_the_middle_of_the/", "score": 1685, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your description of the situation made me very worried for you (sue me, I'm an older sibling), and as harsh as it might sound, I think it might be worth reevaluating these people as friends. Treating you so cavalierly and placing the blame on you for refusing to sleep on the ground while everyone else had mattresses (especially when their other option was to have you stop participating in the sleepover with your friends) is absolutely a red flag. I'm really glad that you were able to go to your parents and get their support. I hope they continue to have your back in the future, and that you continue to refuse to let any so-called friends treat you like a doormat.", "So I get you were uncomfortable and sounds like it\u2019s hard for you to really speak up, especially since you\u2019re avoiding responding back. First off, speak up more assertively if you aren\u2019t having your needs met. Your voice is just as important as anyone else\u2019s. Second, who provided the mattresses? The host or did other guests bring additional? I ask because I wonder if everyone else provided things which would\u2019ve given them priority to use them. \n\nIm gonna say NTA because at the end of the day, based on your story they could\u2019ve put more effort into helping you out outside of you sleeping inside the house. But you should try to practice being more confident and assertive with your friends, for your own sake. Text them back and communicate how you felt, but don\u2019t avoid the texts. And PS. If your friends are the type to leave you out often or walk all over you, they aren\u2019t very good friends and you deserve better :) being a teenager is tough.\n\nEdit: saw in another comment that your friends seem to exclude you and aren\u2019t very good friends. If this is a pattern, maybe it\u2019s best to start distancing yourself from the group and find a true friend who will make you feel like you belong. I know in high school it feels better to have not so great friends Vs being alone, but if these girls are making you feel like crap it\u2019s not worth it. Hope things get better for you.", "A lot of people have commented already, so I\u2019m sure mine will get lost but I feel I need to say something. \n\nOP, when I was 15 I was in a friend group of 6-10 girls. My best friend was one of them, but a few of the girls didn\u2019t like me. So, I was always included, but I never *felt* included. One example was my \u201cfriend\u201d\u2019s birthday was on Valentine\u2019s Day, and she decided to buy every one of her friends a rose for her birthday. Everyone, except me. She \u201cmiscounted\u201d. My best friend and I found out our favorite band was playing a show in the \u201cbig city\u201d 2 hours away from us, so as always, we buy tickets. Our friends find out and all buy tickets. My best friends mom drove us in her Altima, but there\u2019s 5 of us and 4 seats. Who gets to sit in the backseat at the feet of everyone? Me, because \u201cI\u2019m the smallest\u201d\n\nI say all of this to tell you that I understand. My \u201cfriends\u201d constantly made me feel less than all of them. I\u2019m now 34 and I keep in touch with one of them: my best friend. \n\nYou did the right thing. You did something I never would\u2019ve had the balls to do when I was your age. If your friends are truly your friends, they will realize how they fucked up with the way they treated you. They had plenty of time to come with another option besides you sleeping on the floor of a tent. And why would you need to bring extra things to be comfortable when no one else needs to? You have so much more life ahead of you to look forward to, just take solace in the fact that you did exactly what you should have done.", "This totally. They aren't much of a group of friends and I hope she keeps that in mind.\n\nLaying the blame on her is them feeling guilty.", "Yep. This is the kind of thing in your teens that makes you feel crazy, or like you're overreacting to explain, but when you recount it as an adult you're like no.  This was so obviously not okay. It was rude and ostracizing. And any other adult listening would know exactly what it felt like and why you left.", "THIS!!!", "Soooo much this!!!", "Yes, do exactly this OP!! Brush them off like these pathetic bullies don't even matter, and make new, better friends going forward \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "And was the need to bring one communicated?", "That's exactly what I thought as well. It's not an overreation -- it's a simple reaction to discomfort. You thought you might be okay when you didn't get one of the comfortable places to sleep, you tried it but after a while you realized it was NOT going to be okay and you didn't want to spend an uncomfortable night, so you decided to go home. Simple. An appropriate choice, no matter what other people try to tell you.", "Honey, these people aren\u2019t your friends. They\u2019re mean girls. Please don\u2019t give them another thought and just ignore them at school from now on.

It is the person hosting whose job it is, number one to do a headcount and make sure there is enough space before inviting anyone.

I had a similar thing happen at a sleepover when i was teen. I was offered a small spot on the floor while everyone else had beds or air mattresses. When I questioned it, the parents offered me to sleep in another room by myself away from everyone else. So i called my parents and they came and got me. The host and her parents were mad and said i was being too picky but my parents assured me I did the right thing", "NTA.

Man this brought back memories from highschool that I certainly don\u2019t want to remember. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how the hosts didn\u2019t make sure there was enough space on air mattresses for everyone. To have enough space for every person except one is wild. That makes one person singled out, uncomfortable and left out of the group. And the suggestion to sleep alone inside is dumb. Why be at a sleepover just to be by yourself all night? \n\nI feel for you op . It sucks to be left out. You did the right thing by going home to be more comfortable.", "NTA. You never have to stay somewhere you are uncomfortable for any reason.  The solutions they offered you weren't adequate. So you left.  End of story and hopefully everyone can move on.", "NTA\n\nIt was rude of them to exclude you either by leaving on the floor or putting you inside. However, and I hope this doesn\u2019t come off as offensive, you\u2019re all teenagers. You\u2019re all still learning social mores, and how to figure out what makes a good friend.

The whole point is to be in a group laughing and having fun. You can be off by yourself at home in your own bed comfortable. That was a ridiculous solution to even offer. The girl who had an air bed to herself could\u2019ve shared with you if everyone else was sharing. Plus being on the ground uncomfortable is different from sharing a bed uncomfortable. They are looking to start something and the one asking did you respond is an instigator. If you explained it to M, she can deliver the message to the host if a response is that important to her. If you want to respond, say you took her up on her offer. You slept inside, alone, away from the group just at your house in your bed. \n\nI really don\u2019t see why they are hassling you over this.

Found out last year that they still have a group chat without me that they've been making sure I didn't know about. One of them mentioned it in passing then realised and went red and sort of tailed of with 'so... hahah... yeah' and then stopped talking to me. Just felt like the final last straw, a bit of a concrete realisation that they really haven't considered me equal or equally wanted all this time. None of my feelings on that were me being dramatic. I'm almost thirty. God I've wasted so much time burying my feelings and trying to get these people to like me. If OP's reading this far down, take it from someone who tried so long it's sort of hilarious - 'friend' groups stuck in this dynamic never do finally decide to respect and include you.

Did it get eye rolls? Of course. Were enough spares scrounged and space shared so that he could stay warm and safe and comfortable? (as far as you can expect whilst camping) - also of course, because we care about him and wanted him to be there. I feel like the lack of effort from these friends says a lot about how little they value OP either way, and it's just AH behaviour to tell someone they're a friend but act in ways that show they don't actually matter to you or the friendship group as a unit.", "\"They wanted me to sleep o the ground when everyone else had an air mattress.

They want you to say you\u2019re upset so they can be defensive, or they want to turn it around and make it something you did wrong. Don\u2019t let them. Just keep smiling and shrugging.      \nIf someone who wasn\u2019t there asks what happened, explain, but not as if you care, \u201coh, unfortunately it turned out they were short one air mattress and I just find the ground so uncomfortable to sleep on, so I decided to sleep in my bed instead.\u201d Keep smiling.\n\nYour people are out there. You\u2019ll find them, I promise.", "Wait we don't know. It's unusual for a family to have enough bedding for 8-9 teens lying around. \nIf they were supposed to bring their own sleeping bag or air mattress, and OP didn't realize it or spaced it, it doesn't mean the host or the other girls were AHs. She was offered bedding.", "Yeah I had a really similar experience as a teen, went to a friend's party where it was a sleepover in a tent. They wanted to do makeovers and I'd never worn make up before so wanted to show me how to put make up on. I thought that was really nice until I realised they had drawn all over my face in waterproof eyeliner (such a waste of eyeliner as well). They didn't offer anything to take it off with and I ended up spending about an hour in the bathroom trying to get it off. I should have gone home then but I hadn't been to a lot of sleepovers (protective parents) so thought this might just be part of it.\n\nWe then went out to camp it was November and it was freezing but I had a winter sleeping bag so I thought I'd be ok. I woke up cold in the night but half asleep found a spare blanket to pull over me and then I was fine. I didn't realise until I woke up that morning that they had all gone back inside to sleep not long after I fell asleep and hadn't bothered to wake me. Id always half wondered if these people were really my friends but that's when I got my answer. I went inside and they were all having breakfast together. The mum seemed to be being extra nice but I was over it. Got dressed went home and never bothered with those girls again.\n\nSorry really long comment but that's to say I've been in a really similar position OP and these girls are not good people or your friends. Don't waste any more of your time or energy on them.", "\u201cIf I\u2019m sleeping inside then I\u2019m not part of the party- it\u2019s no different than me going home.

And then distance yourself from them and concentrate on getting better friends. You were right to leave NTA.", "NTA at all.\n\nId open their messages and leave them on read.\n\nThen I'd ignore them at school, find some better friends.\n\nDon't let them bully you, or gaslight you. They fully intended on you being the object of their 'fun', at that sleep over, you put a stop to it, and are now trying to make it seam like you over reacted, you didn't.", "NTA none of them offered to sleep on the ground or to sleep inside, alone.", "Nta\nIn my opinion the host should sleep on the floor if needed. \nIt is okay too leave a situation you feel unconfortable in.\nI do understand the frustration and sadness when someone you consider a friend left you out. It's a shitty feeling. And you are not selfish! \nYou can explain the situation but don't apologize for leaving.", "NTA", "How would sleeping inside the house by yourself be any different than you going home?", "Yes OP, keep it vague, keep it light, and start making new friends.", "You did the right thing. NTA at all and you can show them this comment section so they realize what A-holes they were. Why would you want to sleep inside away from your friends, that defeats the purpose of a sleepover party. And why would THEY want you to sleep inside by yourself? Shitty friends. If my friend was ever at my house and didn\u2019t have somewhere to sleep, they got my bed and I slept on the floor. I can\u2019t imagine bei my so un-accommodating to a friend. And it\u2019s even shittier because you were singled out, no one else had to sleep on the ground but you. So that feels even worse and they\u2019re idiots or mean girls or both if they don\u2019t understand that.\n\nAlso, you made a mature decision. If you\u2019re uncomfortable in a situation, you don\u2019t ever have to stay in it. You have the right to leave. Good job. You\u2019re more mature than the rest of them", "NTA.  And not that you owe these so-called friends any explanation whatsoever, but should you respond, here's a thought.\n\nDear Friends,\n\nI left because:\n\n1.) Everyone else had an air mattress to sleep on but I was on ground on a thin duvet.  When I explained that this was uncomfortable, it was suggested that I should sleep inside by myself.\n\n2.) Sleeping alone inside while everyone else was outside sleeping on air mattresses and having fun was not an acceptable alternative.  \n\nI think that calling me names (selfish, really?) for leaving an unacceptable situation that was created by the people calling me names is an effort by the name-callers to deflect responsibility for what happened.  The responsibility lies with the people who provided everyone but me with an air mattress to sleep on and, and whose behavior shows that they didn't care if I was either uncomfortable or isolated.\n\nI left because I have self-respect.  I would do it again.  I find the lack of kindness and empathy reflected in your messages to be disappointing.  I look forward to your apology.\n\nBest,\n\nOP", "What's their problem? They offered for you sleep inside so you did.\n\nOoohhh! They didn't mean like that! In your own bed!\n\nNTA", "Nta,  find new friends. It's not going to be anything other than toxic.", "NTA. I personally believe you shouldn't be forced to stay at an event you don't want to any more than you want to regardless of the host's feelings on it. It's not their choice what you feel and what you want to do. If they are so concerned you left and why, they can ask. Besides, they treated you like shit. You had every reason to leave, go sleep in your comfy bed!", "NTA. Anytime you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable for any reason you are right to leave.", "You have learned a valuable life skill that it takes some people well into adulthood to learn (if ever!). If you are ever in a situation that you are not enjoying or that you feel uncomfortable in it is absolutely ok to remove yourself! In fact it\u2019s more than ok, it\u2019s encouraged! So many people wouldn\u2019t because they are worried about being judged or think it\u2019s rude but you should never ignore your gut feeling. The fact that they are all so uncomfortable with it is because they would never be strong enough to do that but it really is important to advocate for yourself. NTA and quite frankly well done!", "They're not your friends. And you're NTA", "Nta, I would simply message the host back, hey I\u2019m sorry I left I didn\u2019t feel comfortable being the only one sleeping inside and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable being the only one excluded from having a space on the air mattresses. It really came across that you and everyone couldn\u2019t care less if I was there or not so I simply decided that leaving was what was best for everyone. I really hope you had a fantastic rest of the night.", "You were getting texts b/c they were feeling uncomfortable; they recognized, at least at some level, that they'd treated you poorly & felt bad about it. They should've felt bad.  I'm really glad you left! You did the right thing. I hope you continue to stick up for yourself by removing yourself from bad situations!", "Wow, you just described the entirety of my school experience. \n\nNever did find a place to fit in.  Post-Covid, I\u2019ve stopped trying.", "She was offered to fuck off basically. What's the point of a sleepover if OP is forced to sleep seperately from the entire group?\n\nCan you imagine being invited to a dinner party but the entire group sits together around a big table but you are seated on the other side of the restaurant alone. Are you actually part of the dinner?"]}
