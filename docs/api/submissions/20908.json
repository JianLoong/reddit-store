A few times I have gone to Starbucks with her and like gotten our nails done together.  I got busy with school and focusing on weight loss I didn\u2019t see them until this early June. Yes of course there were breaks but I wanted to rest in my apartment because I was burnt out from school.

She started to loose her temper and started to insult me. Saying that I used to be a fat cow and other things of that sort.

Her insecurities are not your problem.", "OP please send this post to your parents, brother, SIL and anyone who\u2019s on their side so they can wake up to themselves. If you do end up going to her wedding be sure to look INCREDIBLE. \n\nOr book yourself an amazing holiday while they have the wedding. If anyone asks why you didn\u2019t attend tell them the truth, that SIL in law is a horribly insecure.", "NTA\n\nGood for you lol", "NTA. She was skinny shaming over being insecure about her wedding. This is ridiculous, and I feel weddings today tend to bring out the absolute worst in people. The fact that your brother goes along with that means he\u2019s as big an AH as she is.", "NTA!!!!!!! She\u2019s an insecure asshat. You do what\u2019s best for YOU.", "NTA and coming from a person who weighs 200 pounds.

Petty maybe but deserved.", "100% NTA. She can dictate what you wear for the wedding, but she can\u2019t dictate your body. That\u2019s ridiculous.

You didn't need to sink to her level). \n\nBoth your brother and his fianc\u00e9e are TA for having the audacity to ask you to gain weight on purpose after you worked so hard, and for what? Her ego? Jfc what a piece of work they both are.", "ESH - please be careful with your weight loss as its extremely easy to overdo it and end up dangerously underweight with body dysmorphia. 105 lbs is very very small by North American standards for an adult female.  SIL is ridiculous for asking you to gain weight.   You're both assholes for name calling and fat-shaming.", "NTA. The name calling was a bit over the top, but honestly, it would be hard to resist. If she's that insecure that a smaller person is threatening to her self esteem, she's going to run into difficulties - not only with you, but with many others. It's a ridiculous ask to think you would regain weight that you lost to make her feel better about herself for one day! Is she selecting the wedding guests by weight? \n\nIt's a shame your parents and brother are buying into that weirdness, but I wouldn't feel bad at all about missing the wedding and avoiding them all.", "ESH. Wild of her to ask you to gain weight, obviously you suck for calling her a fat bitch. Congrats, you both suck, you're both obsessed with your weight loss.", "ESH - I was going with \"not\" right up until the insult. You were well within your rights to maintain your boundaries over an unrealistic and honestly awful request. But trading insults for insults is childish and an asshole move.", "Esh \n\nHer ask was ridiculous and she was rude as hell. That being said, that doesn\u2019t excuse your over the top comment. A simple \u201cno I\u2019m not putting on weight\u201d and that is the end of it", "ESH. You sound incredibly self absorbed.

That said, I have an awful lot of sympathy. You were actually way more polite than I would have been lol", "ESH.

Just a bit of advice moving forward! \n\nI\u2019m sorry your brother is marrying such an insecure and mean woman. This is a mess of a situation for you.", "Did you mention you were losing weight to your SIL prior to the wedding??  Might have been something they could have adjusted. \nYTA- I get wanting to show up skinny , but the bride planned for a bm 20lbs heavier.", "ESH - tbh this all sounds like a mess where youre all horrible to each other.", "ESH she shouldn\u2019t have asked you to change your body in any form. You should have maintained your calm demeanor", "ESH\n\nThe bride being jealous of you for losing weight, and getting angry about it and hurling insults your? That's makes her an AH.\n\nBut you came right over the top with the same AH behavior, so you are an AH here too, OP.\n\nShe said mean things to you, but then you lost any moral high ground you had by responding in kind. It seem like you could benefit from some lessons in empathy, ESPECIALLY given your own weight history and given the hard work you put in. You could share your story as encouragement if she has the same sort of weight loss goals, rather than throw it in her face with an insult.\n\nAltogether, the bride's behavior is more striking, as if she only chose you as a bridesmaid because you were overweight, not because she actually likes you as a friend. That's pretty messed up on its own, and you're completely justified in deciding not to attend. That said, maybe there's room for tempers to calm down.\n\nI'm not saying you need to, but IF you authentically apologize, she might as well, and you may be able to help her celebrate her day with cooler heads prevailing. Planning a wedding can be extremely stressful, and adding on top of that body self-image issues I could see where she'd be upset, but her behavior did go way overboard.", "Clearly ESH. But you were only the tiniest bit of an AH relative to everyone else. You clearly didn't have to call her out of her name like that, but I get it. Your SIL was a big (no pun intended) AH, and your brother was a coward here", "NTA. At all. Fatties need to stop projecting and get on a treadmill.", "Lmao honey honeyyyyyy to be a fly on the wall. To really ask someone to gain or lose weight for a wedding is outrageous. Yes your comment was rude but she kept going and pushing her insecurity on you.", "Nope. she wanted to shame you and make herself feel better by putting you down AND your brother and parents are dips. Cut contact with them if they think like this because obviously they don't care about you or your health. You lost weight for YOU and no one else. Your sister in law can go to a damn gym.", "NTA.

That's great!  It couldn't have been easy!  As a random internet dad, I'm proud of you!\n\nSIL is being ridiculous.  It's absolutely bonkers to ask someone to put on weight so they don't make the bride look fat.  That's....crazy to say the least.", "NTA. She started it.", "NTA, and while this is a crappy story & situation, I do like these ones where it's clear that the young adult OP is smarter in multiple ways than the idiots in their family and that they'll most likely get themselves in a better position in a handful of years.", "NTA I mean, you probably shouldn\u2019t have called her a fat bitch, lol, but seriously what the hell was she even thinking asking you that? Absolutely wild.", "NTA", "She sounds pretty stupid, honestly.  \nIf you lose weight, you can generally still wear a dress.. it's pretty easy for a good seamstress to tack it in a bit here and there.  \nBut if you *gain* weight, there is no guarantee your dress will still fit you. There is also no guarantee that the \"few pounds\" she wanted you to gain would go on in places that would be noticeable to anyone under a bridesmaids dress.  \n You could end up with slightly larger bustline and booty and end up making her look worse than ever. \n\nNTA, obviously", "NTA", "Y T A for being incapable of fucking splitting this shit into paragraphs.\n\nNTA for the situation at hand.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI would have laughed in her face and said muuuuch worse- if it were me she were speaking to she'd be crying by the end of the conversation \n\nHow dare she \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "No thoose few pounds may not come back off.

I downloaded the app lifesum (I paid for the premium version though so don't remember how useful the free version was) and used that to count what I was eating. It even has recipes and such as well which is great for suggestions. Just remember to also include any drinks you have, it's amazing how much you can gain just from fizzy drinks. Lots of people found they started losing weight just cutting those out completely)\n\nThe way to lose weight is simple, eat less calories than you burn. Actually committing to it and carrying it out is the hard part and boy do I know that.\n\nSeeing how many calories I was consuming really helped me to keep on top of it and realise the amount of crap I was eating too thus I began to have a healthier diet as well.\n\nDepending on your goal you might also want to exercise too. \n\nHowever, the thing to remember is unless you are doing an absolute ton of exercise it isn't going to increase the calories you're allowed to eat all that much as such don't compensate much for this by eating more. Due to evolution our bodies have become extremely efficient at burning energy.\n\nFor me to burn off a tub of Ben and Jerry's ice-cream (465ml or a little under a pint) a man of my size (6ft 3) and slightly overweight has to run about 11-12 miles (if I'm remembering correctly) someone smaller than me would have to run even further!\n\nIt's insane just how something so small, but admittedly calorie dense, can fuel someone for so long.\n\nThere's a reason for the phrase (paraphrasing this) \"gain muscle in the gym, lose weight in the kitchen\" \n\nGaining muscle and exercise do both however help you to burn more calories, lose weight and generally feel better about how you look due to appearing more toned. On top of this it is proven that exercising often helps people's mental state, make people feel like they have more energy (once used to it) and can even help cognitive function.\n\nIf you are well off then a personal trainer is great to help keep you motivated, working out and dieting. I wish I could afford one.\n\nIf not then see if you can get a friend to remind you to work out, ask you what you ate and so on (provided you are not likely to develop an eating disorder or dislike of them if they criticise you for not sticking to your eating plan). \n\nI personally find having someone be expectant of me to do my diet and exercise helps make me do it even if I don't want to.\n\nDon't go insane with it. Plenty of people fail because they will suddenly go from their usual sedentary self to suddenly trying to exercise as much as possible while also cutting their calorie intake by a drastic amount. That's a good way to make yourself miserable and feel unwell.\n\nLastly, don't go into it expecting to see immediate changes. Realise that this is a long term project that only works if you stick at it. There are actors and such that manage to make huge changes in a few months but you have to remember these guys are paid to make these changes, have the time to do it as it's prepping for a role and have a team of people behind them to make it happen and this can often still be done unhealthily due to being so fast.\n\nFor an example of thinking you should be seeing more changes, If you are exercising and dieting at the same time it might before the first few months you feel like nothing is happening as you are barely losing weight. \n\nChances are you are gaining and developing muscles while you lose fat. Muscle weighs more than fat and if you have been sedentary prior to this then your body will be piling on the muscle to adapt to this new state of exercising so much.", "For me, I started cooking from scratch when I got a scary gut-related health diagnosis.  For about 6 months I was on a strict anti-inflammatory diet (no gluten, sugar, red meat, coffee, dairy, preservatives, etc) and ate super cleanly.  (I'm fine now--it worked!)  Meal planning everything with these strict constraints forced me to learn new recipes, change the type of food I buy, and got me into the habit of prepping certain foods in bulk (brown rice, dried beans, etc).  And I just fell into a habit at that point.  Now I'll go out to a restaurant once in a while or even bake something sweet at home, but I'm so adjusted to cooking healthy meals that it's just routine for me now.  Pre-packaged meals are a thing of the past.  I started this in late 2020 and still eat this way so it's very sustainable.  Granted, you HAVE to enjoy cooking for this routine to stick--for me, cooking has become a deeply enjoyable, grounding hobby.\n\nI lost around 35 pounds overall (5'6\" and down to 120 from the mid-to-high 150s).

There\u2019s inches of fat that probably don\u2019t need to be there. Body fat is probably over 30%.", "Well technically you\u2019re right, but 130 is the very upper limit of healthy weight for that height. I know because I\u2019m 5\u20191\u201d too LOL and for a few months after my second was born I hovered around 127. I did look chubby. There\u2019s just not a lot of room in a 5\u20191\u201d persons body; 10lbs makes a HUGE difference at my height.", "I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d and 180 pounds. I\u2019m \u2026 thin. Size 6-8. I\u2019m also one big slab of muscle, and even my doctor is stunned that I weigh so much. \u201cYou look like you weigh 140 sopping wet!\u201d But I lift and exercise a lot. \n\nBMI is bullshit. Weight is bullshit. Not one person who ever looked at me would think I\u2019m overweight. But my BMI says I\u2019m obese. Even with my 20% max body fat (which is appropriate for a female athlete)", "I'm 5'2\" and was always told I was overweight at 130. No one ever did a fat percentage, or asked about my activity level or anything. They just looked at my 17 yr old cross country running, drum corps marching, triathlete who was always so dense she couldn't float in fresh water ass, and told me to shoot for 107. I'm not at all surprised that these Very Healthy Sized young women are stressed about their bodies. Bummed out but not surprised.", "The general rule I learned growing up decades ago was at 5\u2019 a healthy weight is 100lbs. For each inch over add 5lbs.  So at 5\u20191\u201d she is as expected medically. We may not like this, but it\u2019s what your dr will evaluate you at.", "Yeah complaining totally. I guess I took it as inner disappointment with the machine being in use. Thanks for clarifying", "But not too much water cos you can die from over hydration", "I hate the scales that act like one weight fits all. I feel that BMI is just a joke, like it doesn't account for broad frames. I've been labeled \"obese\" if I look at BMI, but holy cow it wants me to be 140-177lbs and I haven't weighed that since I was a 14yo bean pole. I've been between 220 and 250 since college, though a lot of muscle has turned to dad bod and I've hovered at the 230 mark for a while.  I can't imagine being lighter than 200lbs, I'd be a skeleton. A wide \"overweight\" skeleton.\n\nI agree with NTA, could you imagine somebody saying \"you need to lose a few pounds to be in my wedding\"? Why in the world would the opposite be acceptable.", "Literally, omg. This mindset is super toxic :/", "I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d and had a doctor tell me to lose a few pounds at 135. The BMI chart they use is messed up.", "I\u2019m also 5\u20194 and within that same weight range and my tummy is definitely the fattest part of my body \ud83d\ude10 My legs and arms are noodles, though \ud83e\udd74", "That\u2019s exactly what we were taught in nursing school in the mid 1980s. I\u2019m old and I know it.", "Same here. Felt fat and uncomfortable at 130. Much more comfortable at 120 although I\u2019d probably look better at 110", "I\u2019m 4\u201911 and at my absolute skinniest I couldn\u2019t get below 120. The BMI thing absolutely made me cry when we did it in high school. I definitely didn\u2019t look that weight.", ">Its not like they lowered the BMI for overweight\n\nThey actually did back in the 90s iirc", "tysm!! 5\u20191\u201d as well and it can be tough for us short girls. Appreciate the step by step \ud83e\ude77", "Sleep is your body\u2019s time to rebuild and regulate. Sleep also has a big effect on your hormones, can\u2019t remember the study off the top of my head but something like if you get less sleep you are more likely to be hungry and crave carby/unhealthy foods.", "Getting enough sleep helps with everything. You will feel more motivated, less likely to snack/overeat because you feel energized already, and also it\u2019s the time when your body is recovering most. Your body does need to rest when you are losing weight, especially if you are exercising. Evidence is coming out showing that getting adequate sleep is even more important than previously thought - less than 6 hrs regularly can increase risk of stroke, heart attack, etc. Any person interested in becoming healthier MUST prioritize sleep, whether trying to lose weight or not.", "If you get too little sleep, your body produces more of a hormone called ghrelin, the hunger hormone. It makes you more hungry and increases your drive to eat. So when you don't get enough sleep you can gain weight because your body stimulates you to eat more.\n\n\nAnd that is only one of the things that are out of balance when you get too little sleep. A lot of things in the body function differently when you don't get enough sleep and can then directly or indirectly influence your physical and mental health, how wel your brain, heart, digestive system and other organs work, how you feel, how much pain you have, how tired you are, how hungry you are, how well you digest food, how happy you are, etc.\n\nSleep is very important.", "Embarrassing \u201ccomeback\u201d but ok\u2026you seem like some batshit crazy \u201cintuitive eating- but only when it\u2019s consuming MORE food\u201d \u201ccounsellors\u201d with no credibility or qualifications who seem to believe you\u2019re a pillar of knowledge for disordered behaviours because YOU have disordered behaviours and have chatted to a few body dysmorphics. You\u2019re forcing your \u201cknowledge\u201d into conversations where no one asked and where it is absolutley not relevant to the conversation. \n\nYour reference to North American weight standards told me everything I needed to know because imagine implying somebody of a healthy weight has food and body issues (because yes, that is absolutley what your original comment implied), but then backing up your \u201cconcern\u201d by comparing OPs weight to the \u201cstandard\u201d which is simply disgusting and unhealthy. America\u2019s obesity rate is alarming and I had truly never seen a person in real life as fat as the fat American characters in the media until I went to America and saw them EVERYWHERE. I have travelled a lot and America is the only place where this is a humongous concern. People like you seem to promote these behaviours (by mentioning these standards and assuming those who lose weight have disordered eating issues lol), and there is this toxic positivity towards overeating in general in America, people literally think it\u2019s quirky to eat a packet of biscuits, alone, in one sitting when it\u2019s actually revolting and literal binge eating. OP was an overweight child. She is now a healthy women. You are strange for turning this conversation into something it isn\u2019t just so you can bark on about \u201cnOrTh AmErIcAn StAnDaRdS\u201d lol", "Yeah, exactly. I'm 4'11.5 and 111 lbs, a 20lb weight gain since covid. I'm not overweight by BMI or anything, but on me it definitely doesn't look or feel skinny. My thighs are rubbing uncomfortably when they never did before. I have a very visible belly, and a double chin that appears in photos now as well. Other parts of me look better, like my butt, but I want to get back down to 100 lbs because its just so much more comfortable/healthy feeling.", "I also found out about waist measurements. At a healthy weight, 6' and 140 pounds, my waist was still below the 'healthy' or 'average' category because of my bone structure. And small people exist too. \n\nBMI is a guideline, but there are enough exceptions. Some people have a lot of muscles, and some people are naturally more skinny or heavier. My comfortable weight is 125 lbs with no problems at slightly over 6', and my optimum weight would be 132 lbs, looking at my genes and bone structure.", "Honey, I was 5'4\" and 150 and I was fat.", "You're completely correct. A BMI of 24.6 is pretty darn close to a BMI of 25, which is overweight (albeit only slightly).\n\nYou'ree getting down voted because people are angry to be told facts.", "I'm 4'11.5, so only half an inch shorter. 100 lbs was a perfectly healthy weight for me and most people around 5 feet tall. Even 95 lbs was considered normal and healthy, if you want to take that extra half inch into account. Now, I was underweight at 85 lbs when I was in college, but not enough that any doctor was worried about me and I definitely didn't have an eating disorder or anything.", "These are my awards, Mother. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing.", "It\u2019s because you\u2019re not overweight, though. It\u2019s a pound under overweight at 5\u20190\u201d, and at 5\u20193\u201d it\u2019s a solidly healthy weight??? I feel like I\u2019m drinking crazy juice over here.", "...I'm 5'3\" and have started to *feel* fat because I gained about 5 pounds and went from 135 to 140. And many of my pairs of pants stopped fitting well and I have this pudge on my stomach that I can't stand looking at. Even though I'm still apparently just barely in the normal BMI range.\n\nSeeing this makes me feel a bit better. Maybe I'm worrying too much about it, but I do still want to start exercising.", "You're just mad because you're suddenly realizing your ass can be kicked by women. Suck it up, buttercup. The rest of us already knew.", "Frame is SO important. At 5 foot nothing my \"healthy\" weight makes me look super sickly. I naturally teeter between 125-130 and I look fine there. Technically my BMI is too high, but I have a lot of natural muscle and I'm very bottom heavy and I take after my mother with denser bone structure. \nI've only ever had one doctor who told me my BMI was too high and I need to lose weight, I pretty much laughed her off.", "You don't know for sure but when you hear hoof beats think horses not zebras. And in the western English speaking world where about 70% are overweight or obese when I hear 'overweight' BMI, I think overfat not body builder."]}
