Throughout my childhood I was overweight. I started to realize this in about 7th grade and I kept failing to loose weight. About 6 months ago, I actually stuck to a regime of weight loss and it worked. I was 135 pounds and 5\u201d1 now I am 105 pounds. 6 -7 months ago, my brother gave me a heads up that his now wife whom then I was kind of friends with wanted me there as a bridesmaid. A few times I have gone to Starbucks with her and like gotten our nails done together.  I got busy with school and focusing on weight loss I didn\u2019t see them until this early June. Yes of course there were breaks but I wanted to rest in my apartment because I was burnt out from school.  I appreciate them understanding I have school and can\u2019t make it when they were picking bridesmaids dresses or other things of that sort. (The college I go to is across the country we live in the east coast). So when I saw them this late may 30 pounds lighter, my now sister in law said \u201cwhy did you loose weight ?\u201d And I replied saying \u201cbecause I  felt I wasn\u2019t healthy now I feel my best.\u201d She frowned and didn\u2019t say anything. I chalked it up to her being a bit nervous about her wedding. She had already sent me the photos of the dress and needed me to come for measurements, but I couldn\u2019t due to it wasn\u2019t in my budget (flight tickets are expensive) So they got me a face time with the person who measures and makes the dresses based on that and helped me measure over call. (They weren\u2019t there while I was measuring they were preparing for something else). So my brother after the conversation that happened above came up to me and asked me if I could put on a few pounds. And explained his now wife is jealous of how I look thinner than her. I asked to speak to her about this matter. She agreed to talk and I told her that her big day should not be ruined by how big or small someone is and we should love how we are. She got angry and told me it isn\u2019t hard to gain a few pounds in the next 3 weeks. I told her calmly I won\u2019t be attending if she thinks like this. She started to loose her temper and started to insult me. Saying that I used to be a fat cow and other things of that sort. So I finally just said \u201cI\u2019m not coming to your wedding you fat bitch\u201d. My brother and our parents are calling me out and saying I messed up.

Jfc what a piece of work they both are.", "ESH - please be careful with your weight loss as its extremely easy to overdo it and end up dangerously underweight with body dysmorphia. 105 lbs is very very small by North American standards for an adult female.  SIL is ridiculous for asking you to gain weight.   You're both assholes for name calling and fat-shaming.", "NTA. The name calling was a bit over the top, but honestly, it would be hard to resist. If she's that insecure that a smaller person is threatening to her self esteem, she's going to run into difficulties - not only with you, but with many others. It's a ridiculous ask to think you would regain weight that you lost to make her feel better about herself for one day! Is she selecting the wedding guests by weight? \n\nIt's a shame your parents and brother are buying into that weirdness, but I wouldn't feel bad at all about missing the wedding and avoiding them all.", "ESH. Wild of her to ask you to gain weight, obviously you suck for calling her a fat bitch. Congrats, you both suck, you're both obsessed with your weight loss.", "ESH - I was going with \"not\" right up until the insult.

That said, I have an awful lot of sympathy. You were actually way more polite than I would have been lol", "ESH.

Just a bit of advice moving forward! \n\nI\u2019m sorry your brother is marrying such an insecure and mean woman. This is a mess of a situation for you.", "Did you mention you were losing weight to your SIL prior to the wedding??  Might have been something they could have adjusted. \nYTA- I get wanting to show up skinny , but the bride planned for a bm 20lbs heavier.", "ESH - tbh this all sounds like a mess where youre all horrible to each other.", "ESH she shouldn\u2019t have asked you to change your body in any form. You should have maintained your calm demeanor", "ESH\n\nThe bride being jealous of you for losing weight, and getting angry about it and hurling insults your? That's makes her an AH.\n\nBut you came right over the top with the same AH behavior, so you are an AH here too, OP.\n\nShe said mean things to you, but then you lost any moral high ground you had by responding in kind. It seem like you could benefit from some lessons in empathy, ESPECIALLY given your own weight history and given the hard work you put in. You could share your story as encouragement if she has the same sort of weight loss goals, rather than throw it in her face with an insult.\n\nAltogether, the bride's behavior is more striking, as if she only chose you as a bridesmaid because you were overweight, not because she actually likes you as a friend. That's pretty messed up on its own, and you're completely justified in deciding not to attend. That said, maybe there's room for tempers to calm down.\n\nI'm not saying you need to, but IF you authentically apologize, she might as well, and you may be able to help her celebrate her day with cooler heads prevailing. Planning a wedding can be extremely stressful, and adding on top of that body self-image issues I could see where she'd be upset, but her behavior did go way overboard.", "Clearly ESH. But you were only the tiniest bit of an AH relative to everyone else. You clearly didn't have to call her out of her name like that, but I get it. Your SIL was a big (no pun intended) AH, and your brother was a coward here", "NTA. At all. Fatties need to stop projecting and get on a treadmill.", "Lmao honey honeyyyyyy to be a fly on the wall. To really ask someone to gain or lose weight for a wedding is outrageous. Yes your comment was rude but she kept going and pushing her insecurity on you.", "Nope. she wanted to shame you and make herself feel better by putting you down AND your brother and parents are dips.

Who are we supposed to impress?", "Ridiculous", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you fat\u201d", "thats what I was thinking 130 is a bit overweight for 5'1 but its pretty far from what i consider fat", "I may be wrong, but I don\u2019t think this person meant it this way. When gyms are busy and full, it can be annoying when people are on machines you want to use. You\u2019re not entitled to them, so you would never say anything, but it\u2019s still irritating when you just want to do your thing.

I didn\u2019t cut everything out at once. I also didn\u2019t do an intense workout schedule in the first few weeks. In the first week my focus was to slowly cut out some of the sweets I eat.

I first did her 20 min and worked my way up to her 40-1hr workouts Now I use weights with the workout. I stayed in a calorie deficit. I was in a 1,500 calorie one, but it depends from person to person. I also stoped using so much butter, sugar and found healthier options. I stopped drinking sugar drinks and opted for water or sparkling water. I got 10k steps every day.", "It feels counterintuitive, but I lost weight the best when I was doing weight training at the gym rather than just/mostly cardio. Plus, I felt healthier when lifting weights than being at the same weight but not lifting.", "Why? You aren\u2019t even overweight, your BMI is normal. Just make sure you get an adequate amount of exercise.", "I did not shame her, I warned her to be careful and confirmed that she is small.  BMI is a stupid indication of health, but go off.", "I'm sorry that you got upset when I called you fat.", "Thank you!!", "Sorry your family has over looked how hard you\u2019ve worked. I\u2019m proud of you internet stranger.", "I was taught that strength training burns more calories than traditional cardio.", "BMI is stupid only for obese people.", "Yes I\u2019m here for you!! Go be the best and healthiest version of you!", "Weight loss is like 80% diet, you don\u2019t need to start on a exercise plan to start losing weight.", "It does!", "I mean most doctors agree it is a stupid metric to assess health, but I guess you're smarter than them, hey?
