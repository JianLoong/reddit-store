A few times I have gone to Starbucks with her and like gotten our nails done together.  I got busy with school and focusing on weight loss I didn\u2019t see them until this early June. Yes of course there were breaks but I wanted to rest in my apartment because I was burnt out from school.

And explained his now wife is jealous of how I look thinner than her. I asked to speak to her about this matter. She agreed to talk and I told her that her big day should not be ruined by how big or small someone is and we should love how we are.

She started to loose her temper and started to insult me. Saying that I used to be a fat cow and other things of that sort. So I finally just said \u201cI\u2019m not coming to your wedding you fat bitch\u201d.       \n      My brother and our parents are calling me out and saying I messed up.

Her insecurities are not your problem.", "OP please send this post to your parents, brother, SIL and anyone who\u2019s on their side so they can wake up to themselves. If you do end up going to her wedding be sure to look INCREDIBLE. \n\nOr book yourself an amazing holiday while they have the wedding. If anyone asks why you didn\u2019t attend tell them the truth, that SIL in law is a horribly insecure.", "NTA\n\nGood for you lol", "NTA. She was skinny shaming over being insecure about her wedding. This is ridiculous, and I feel weddings today tend to bring out the absolute worst in people. The fact that your brother goes along with that means he\u2019s as big an AH as she is.", "NTA!!!!!!! She\u2019s an insecure asshat. You do what\u2019s best for YOU.", "NTA and coming from a person who weighs 200 pounds.

Petty maybe but deserved.", "100% NTA. She can dictate what you wear for the wedding, but she can\u2019t dictate your body. That\u2019s ridiculous.

You didn't need to sink to her level). \n\nBoth your brother and his fianc\u00e9e are TA for having the audacity to ask you to gain weight on purpose after you worked so hard, and for what? Her ego? Jfc what a piece of work they both are.", "ESH - please be careful with your weight loss as its extremely easy to overdo it and end up dangerously underweight with body dysmorphia. 105 lbs is very very small by North American standards for an adult female.  SIL is ridiculous for asking you to gain weight.   You're both assholes for name calling and fat-shaming.", "NTA. The name calling was a bit over the top, but honestly, it would be hard to resist. If she's that insecure that a smaller person is threatening to her self esteem, she's going to run into difficulties - not only with you, but with many others. It's a ridiculous ask to think you would regain weight that you lost to make her feel better about herself for one day! Is she selecting the wedding guests by weight? \n\nIt's a shame your parents and brother are buying into that weirdness, but I wouldn't feel bad at all about missing the wedding and avoiding them all.", "ESH. Wild of her to ask you to gain weight, obviously you suck for calling her a fat bitch. Congrats, you both suck, you're both obsessed with your weight loss.", "ESH - I was going with \"not\" right up until the insult. You were well within your rights to maintain your boundaries over an unrealistic and honestly awful request. But trading insults for insults is childish and an asshole move.", "Esh \n\nHer ask was ridiculous and she was rude as hell. That being said, that doesn\u2019t excuse your over the top comment. A simple \u201cno I\u2019m not putting on weight\u201d and that is the end of it", "ESH. You sound incredibly self absorbed.

That said, I have an awful lot of sympathy. You were actually way more polite than I would have been lol", "ESH. Asking you to gain weight will not make her smaller, but calling names is not an appropriate response.", "ESH. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.

Just a bit of advice moving forward! \n\nI\u2019m sorry your brother is marrying such an insecure and mean woman. This is a mess of a situation for you.", "Did you mention you were losing weight to your SIL prior to the wedding??  Might have been something they could have adjusted. \nYTA- I get wanting to show up skinny , but the bride planned for a bm 20lbs heavier.", "ESH - tbh this all sounds like a mess where youre all horrible to each other.", "ESH she shouldn\u2019t have asked you to change your body in any form. You should have maintained your calm demeanor", "ESH\n\nThe bride being jealous of you for losing weight, and getting angry about it and hurling insults your? That's makes her an AH.\n\nBut you came right over the top with the same AH behavior, so you are an AH here too, OP.\n\nShe said mean things to you, but then you lost any moral high ground you had by responding in kind. It seem like you could benefit from some lessons in empathy, ESPECIALLY given your own weight history and given the hard work you put in. You could share your story as encouragement if she has the same sort of weight loss goals, rather than throw it in her face with an insult.\n\nAltogether, the bride's behavior is more striking, as if she only chose you as a bridesmaid because you were overweight, not because she actually likes you as a friend. That's pretty messed up on its own, and you're completely justified in deciding not to attend. That said, maybe there's room for tempers to calm down.\n\nI'm not saying you need to, but IF you authentically apologize, she might as well, and you may be able to help her celebrate her day with cooler heads prevailing. Planning a wedding can be extremely stressful, and adding on top of that body self-image issues I could see where she'd be upset, but her behavior did go way overboard.", "Clearly ESH. But you were only the tiniest bit of an AH relative to everyone else. You clearly didn't have to call her out of her name like that, but I get it. Your SIL was a big (no pun intended) AH, and your brother was a coward here", "NTA. At all. Fatties need to stop projecting and get on a treadmill.", "Lmao honey honeyyyyyy to be a fly on the wall. To really ask someone to gain or lose weight for a wedding is outrageous. Yes your comment was rude but she kept going and pushing her insecurity on you.", "Nope. she wanted to shame you and make herself feel better by putting you down AND your brother and parents are dips. Cut contact with them if they think like this because obviously they don't care about you or your health. You lost weight for YOU and no one else. Your sister in law can go to a damn gym.", "NTA.

That's great!  It couldn't have been easy!  As a random internet dad, I'm proud of you!\n\nSIL is being ridiculous.  It's absolutely bonkers to ask someone to put on weight so they don't make the bride look fat.  That's....crazy to say the least.", "NTA. She started it.", "NTA, and while this is a crappy story & situation, I do like these ones where it's clear that the young adult OP is smarter in multiple ways than the idiots in their family and that they'll most likely get themselves in a better position in a handful of years.", "NTA I mean, you probably shouldn\u2019t have called her a fat bitch, lol, but seriously what the hell was she even thinking asking you that? Absolutely wild.", "NTA", "She sounds pretty stupid, honestly.  \nIf you lose weight, you can generally still wear a dress.. it's pretty easy for a good seamstress to tack it in a bit here and there.  \nBut if you *gain* weight, there is no guarantee your dress will still fit you. There is also no guarantee that the \"few pounds\" she wanted you to gain would go on in places that would be noticeable to anyone under a bridesmaids dress.  \n You could end up with slightly larger bustline and booty and end up making her look worse than ever. \n\nNTA, obviously", "NTA", "Y T A for being incapable of fucking splitting this shit into paragraphs.\n\nNTA for the situation at hand.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI would have laughed in her face and said muuuuch worse- if it were me she were speaking to she'd be crying by the end of the conversation \n\nHow dare she \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "No thoose few pounds may not come back off.

I downloaded the app lifesum (I paid for the premium version though so don't remember how useful the free version was) and used that to count what I was eating. It even has recipes and such as well which is great for suggestions. Just remember to also include any drinks you have, it's amazing how much you can gain just from fizzy drinks. Lots of people found they started losing weight just cutting those out completely)\n\nThe way to lose weight is simple, eat less calories than you burn. Actually committing to it and carrying it out is the hard part and boy do I know that.\n\nSeeing how many calories I was consuming really helped me to keep on top of it and realise the amount of crap I was eating too thus I began to have a healthier diet as well.\n\nDepending on your goal you might also want to exercise too. \n\nHowever, the thing to remember is unless you are doing an absolute ton of exercise it isn't going to increase the calories you're allowed to eat all that much as such don't compensate much for this by eating more. Due to evolution our bodies have become extremely efficient at burning energy.\n\nFor me to burn off a tub of Ben and Jerry's ice-cream (465ml or a little under a pint) a man of my size (6ft 3) and slightly overweight has to run about 11-12 miles (if I'm remembering correctly) someone smaller than me would have to run even further!\n\nIt's insane just how something so small, but admittedly calorie dense, can fuel someone for so long.\n\nThere's a reason for the phrase (paraphrasing this) \"gain muscle in the gym, lose weight in the kitchen\" \n\nGaining muscle and exercise do both however help you to burn more calories, lose weight and generally feel better about how you look due to appearing more toned. On top of this it is proven that exercising often helps people's mental state, make people feel like they have more energy (once used to it) and can even help cognitive function.\n\nIf you are well off then a personal trainer is great to help keep you motivated, working out and dieting. I wish I could afford one.\n\nIf not then see if you can get a friend to remind you to work out, ask you what you ate and so on (provided you are not likely to develop an eating disorder or dislike of them if they criticise you for not sticking to your eating plan). \n\nI personally find having someone be expectant of me to do my diet and exercise helps make me do it even if I don't want to.\n\nDon't go insane with it. Plenty of people fail because they will suddenly go from their usual sedentary self to suddenly trying to exercise as much as possible while also cutting their calorie intake by a drastic amount. That's a good way to make yourself miserable and feel unwell.\n\nLastly, don't go into it expecting to see immediate changes. Realise that this is a long term project that only works if you stick at it. There are actors and such that manage to make huge changes in a few months but you have to remember these guys are paid to make these changes, have the time to do it as it's prepping for a role and have a team of people behind them to make it happen and this can often still be done unhealthily due to being so fast.\n\nFor an example of thinking you should be seeing more changes, If you are exercising and dieting at the same time it might before the first few months you feel like nothing is happening as you are barely losing weight. \n\nChances are you are gaining and developing muscles while you lose fat. Muscle weighs more than fat and if you have been sedentary prior to this then your body will be piling on the muscle to adapt to this new state of exercising so much.", "For me, I started cooking from scratch when I got a scary gut-related health diagnosis.  For about 6 months I was on a strict anti-inflammatory diet (no gluten, sugar, red meat, coffee, dairy, preservatives, etc) and ate super cleanly.  (I'm fine now--it worked!)  Meal planning everything with these strict constraints forced me to learn new recipes, change the type of food I buy, and got me into the habit of prepping certain foods in bulk (brown rice, dried beans, etc).  And I just fell into a habit at that point.  Now I'll go out to a restaurant once in a while or even bake something sweet at home, but I'm so adjusted to cooking healthy meals that it's just routine for me now.  Pre-packaged meals are a thing of the past.  I started this in late 2020 and still eat this way so it's very sustainable.  Granted, you HAVE to enjoy cooking for this routine to stick--for me, cooking has become a deeply enjoyable, grounding hobby.\n\nI lost around 35 pounds overall (5'6\" and down to 120 from the mid-to-high 150s).

I had so little body fat I had visible abs.\n\nSo yeah I'm still working through that lmao", "i was borderline obese at 125. it isn't about the lbs, it's about the body fat percentage. 130 could be healthy or overweight, you can't really tell from just that info.", "no wonder there's an obesity epidemic when people think it's not. just because you've seen bigger doesn't make it healthy.", "5'1\", 105 lbs is a BMI of just under 20, which is also perfectly healthy.", "BMI is incredibly outdated/irrelevant because it's an estimate, and it doesn't account for the vastly different ways people can have their weight distributed.\n\nFor example: currently I'm 5'3\" and around 150lbs. That makes my BMI 26.6, squarely in the overweight category. No one with more than two brain cells would look at me and say that I could be described as overweight-- I'm not whispy or a twig, but I'm definitely not anywhere near chubby either.\n\nTo have a \"healthy\" BMI I'd need to be 113-130lbs. Even at my lowest weight as an adult, I never got below 136 because while I was burning fat by maintaining a calorie deficit, I was also building up muscle. Muscle is denser than fat, so you'll end up weighing more despite physically being smaller. But at that time, my BMI would have told you that I was still overweight.\n\nNow, if I got my leg amputated tomorrow? I'd be far closer to being classified as underweight than over, with absolutely no change in my actual health-- y'know, other than missing 20-30lbs worth of limb.", "perfectly? it's on the border of overweight for sure.", "There is a new BMI calculator that adds points for being short.

For example you start to crave the garbage foods less, because you want to work out that day and you become very aware of how those foods make you feel.\n\nThe biggest one that people often overlook too is it naturally shifts your view on calories- too many people on a weight loss journey start to make food their enemy, when really it should be viewed as essential fuel, and once you start looking at it that way you start to \u201cspend\u201d your calories in really beneficial ways. i.e. I can\u2019t go to the gym on an empty stomach and still get a productive workout, but I need to remain at a calorie deficit. What can I eat that will fill me up, without being too caloric? Ah a salad and a chicken breast, perfect\u201d \n\nIn fact if you have a big weight loss journey ahead of you I\u2019d tell you cardio and weight lifting are step 1, not even the diet, because the diet naturally solves itself once you commit to an exercise routine", "I thought you were responding directly to OP.

I've lost weight down to OP's current level before and it was always a combination of actual exercise/good nutrition.\n\nThat said, nutrition is absolutely a good portion of weight loss and anyone looking to lose weight should definitely take a good look at what they're eating daily to see if there are any healthy adjustments they can make.", "Also it isn't great to focus solely on weight rather than overall health. There are plenty of \"skinny fat\" people who look thin but are way unhealthier than someone who is overweight but active. I know that often even some health professionals will focus purely on the number on a scale, but all the specialists I know prefer to focus on the type of gradual habit changes like moving more and eating healthier and letting weight loss happen as more of a side effect, since sustainability is so important. \n\nUnfortunately health is a lot harder to visualize than weight so there's just a lot more social pressure for the latter.", "Well I lost 85 pounds and understanding the motivation for why someone would be looking for weight loss advice when they\u2019re at a normal weight is relevant. As my endocrinologist that is board certified in weight loss medicine said to me once I hit the same BMI that this person looking for advice is at, the focus once you\u2019re at a normal BMI should be on body composition and ensuring you have an adequate amount of exercise over maintaining a calorie deficit.", "I'm 5', and the heaviest I've been was 165, but I also had a lot of muscle from being in dance.
