I recently got my own studio apartment after we had a long discussion about where we see our future.  We decided it\u2019s too soon to move in.  He doesn\u2019t pay his own bills (phone, car, insurances), relies on parents for a lot, makes them make doctors appointments for him, which is fine. I had abusive parents so I don\u2019t know if it is jealousy, or if I have the right to think he\u2019s a bit babied. But he\u2019s just not ready to move out of his parents house. Even though he complains & gets an attitude about his mom \u201ctalking too much to him\u201d after work. \n\nI think it\u2019s best we live on our own a while before moving in together. So we can both gain independence. He had plans to move into a house with a friend but how can you go from having almost no expenses to having a mortgage ? \n\nSince I got this place, we went from sleeping over each others parents place every weekend, to him sleeping over my place 4 nights a week. He wants to do it more, but I need personal space. He asked to leave a tooth brush. Some clothes.  I mean, I enjoy the company and love him but why not just move in at that point ? Lol. \nAnyways,\n\nQuickly after I moved in, he asked me for a spare key so he can come in when I\u2019m not at work, maybe surprise me with dinner, ect. \n\nI just feel like since his name isn\u2019t on the lease, he doesn\u2019t pay rent, he shouldn\u2019t have a key. \nAm I being an asshole ?\n\n\nA few have mentioned the red flags on him living on his own. I have tried to talk to him about living costs/basic finances- whenever I try, he says I\u2019m overwhelming him lol. And people on Reddit have told me I come off as judgmental. I love him a lot but I cannot force him to become independent. I\u2019m going to wait until the end of my lease, and if things don\u2019t change, we will have to talk.", "created_utc": 1677538635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dpm6a/aitah_for_not_giving_my_boyfriend_a_spare_key_to/", "score": 574, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm guessing not. You've been together only 9 months. You two still have a lot to learn about each other.

And people on Reddit have told me I come off as judgmental.\n\nYou may be, but there's nothing wrong with being judgmental about a 26 year old man who can't be bothered to discuss or consider things like \"living costs.\"\n\n>I\u2019m going to wait until the end of my lease, and if things don\u2019t change, we will have to talk.\n\nWhy wait?

I tell you what I see here. This clown is going to be moving in with you against your will in no time, especially if he gets to have a key. Not only would I not give him a key I would also not allow him to leave ANY of his personal items in there. No toothbrush, no pillow, no spare clothes. NOTHING. He is relying on Mommy and Daddy for everything and that translates into YOU being his future gravy train.

He's spent nearly 30 years around this horrid woman, learned no life skills except how to rack up balances. She can't drive, she's been mooching off of us paying her rent the past 6 months, hasn't had a job since March 2020, etc. My boyfriend never had a chance, and hasn't had an opportunity to step up until now. \n\nI say this because I've been with him around 4 years now. He would've rotted away in his bedroom drinking himself to death if I didn't intervene. \n\nThis man isn't going to change on his own. And you aren't going to be able to change him either, frankly.

Judgement is how we discern a situation to avoid getting into a bad place. He's 27 years old and still unwilling or unable to manage the most basic of adult tasks. You should use your judgement to determine if you want to be saddled with someone who is still this dependent on his parents at this age. It's to his benefit that you not be judgemental, because then he can work his way into your life and home and transfer his dependence from his mother to you. Of course he doesn't want you to exercise judgement because if you do you will see all the red flags in this relationship.", "He's had 26 years to figure it out. He's been an adult for 8 years.

Make it clear to him that this is important to you and you will not put up with someone who makes promises they refuse to keep.

It is not you, and I'm willing to bet it's not anything about you even that is overwhelming him or making him feel bad. He is feeling insecure and inadequate. On his own. In his own life and trajectory. Do not allow him to internally make you feel responsible for that. A mature, responsible and caring adult in a relationship would be lifting you up and would be able to lift himself up as well. Of course we all hit bumps and get down in life.

He\u2019s had 6 years to make plans and hasn\u2019t, which is a big red flag. \n\nYou don\u2019t want him recreating what he has at his parents with you.

I get it's easy to jump to those conclusion, especially on this sub, but is possible he lived a sheltered life and is that clueless and doesn't know how to love on his own yet.

At the time I got a key to my boyfriends place, we weren't quite at the stage of moving in yet, but I hated where I lived so it wasn't comfortable for either of us to stay there.

So anyone who questions why he\u2019s drifting through life at 27 with no plan, letting others pay his bills is \u201cjudgmental \u201c?  Well, maybe he\u2019s right, but he kind of deserves it.  QUESTION:  where do YOU see your life in 5 years, and 10 years, OP?  And how does BF fit in to that plan, if we assume he is still drifting at that point?   When I was your age I categorized guys into \u201cjust for fun\u201d and \u201cpossible life partner\u201d.  Sometimes I just wanted the fun guy, sometimes something more stable.  This guy sounds like he\u2019s just for fun, and that\u2019s great, nothing wrong with that but you don\u2019t give him a key to your apartment.", "Having expectations is not being judgemental. Get away from this loser. You were living at home a few months ago because you were a teenager. He's almost thirty, has dropped out of college, has no goals or motivation, and is happy letting someone else support him. Don't become the next person who supports him.", "Does this clown even have a job?", "He just want to keep being a child, that's why he doesn't think about future or moving out \n\nI'm from a culture where you only move out when you get married, with that being said, I had a partner that wanted a bit of independence, and move out from his mother house \n\nBelieve me when I tell you this man didn't know how to do anything, he didn't know how to cook, clean, laundry,  budget, grocery shopping, ANYTHING\nAnd that was because his mother did everything for him \n\nI'm not saying your boyfriend is like my ex, but there is a high chance that If somewhere in the future, he just went from his parents house to your house, he will expect for you to be \"mommy\" and do everything for him because he doesn't know how", "Okay, well YOU get overwhelmed at the thought of him having a key to your place. He has to respect that. And if he\u2019s thinking about the future now he can start showing you that.", "You\u2019re not being judgmental. He\u2019s just hoping you ignore all the red flags.\n\nHe\u2019s never going to be independent.", "Yes", "I feel he thinks since you\u2019re younger you\u2019ll be naive  and let him move in and once he\u2019s comfortable he\u2019ll just keep not paying rent or being an adult and think it\u2019s okay, and since you\u2019re \u2018in a relationship & in love\u2019 it\u2019s okay when it\u2019s not.", "Then where does all of his money go?", "OP this is the real question right here. \nSeriously he should have a real fat nest egg at this point(even if he was saving casually)"]}
