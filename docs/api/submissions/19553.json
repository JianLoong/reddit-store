I have 4B type hair which is usually put into braids (most likely goddess box braids). My friend (25F) is white with pin straight hair. We are close family friends, but don\u2019t really talk much as we have our own lives, but are still on good terms. She messaged me a couple months back that she was having a wedding and invited me to be one of her bridesmaids. Of course, I said yes and was added to a groupchat with all her bridesmaids. All white. I didn\u2019t really think anything of it, of course. As soon as I was added, a girl asked me \u201cOh, is that you in your profile picture?\u201d (a picture of me, a woc). I said yes, and the girl immediately asked the bride to dm her. As this groupchat went on, all the girls were very.. off with me. The bride later began becoming off with me too, but I didn\u2019t mention anything. \n\nA week went past since I was added, and we were discussing the hair and makeup. One of the bridesmaids said.\n\u201cOn that matter, @myname, won\u2019t you have to like get your hair straight permed or something? I don\u2019t know how your hair works.\u201d\nI replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll just get my braids freshly done. Why do you ask?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we all have straight hair and we just don\u2019t want hair like yours ruining the theme of clean hair.\u201d\n\u2018Clean hair??\u2019 I thought. I held back my thoughts and just remembered I don\u2019t know these girls and they\u2019re probably just misunderstanding of black features (bride and bridesmaids grew up in a white dominated town). I politely replied telling her braids are just as clean as straight hair, and getting a silk press would damage my hair. The bridesmaid just reacted to my message with a \u201c\ud83d\ude2c\u201d. The bride called me a couple minutes after and asked me if I could just get a silk press so my hair didn\u2019t \u2018ruin the theme\u2019. I replied with \u201c\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Ruin the theme? My hair will be damaged from getting a silk press. I\u2019ll make sure my braids are neat, trust me girl.\u201d She angrily replied, \u201cWell, until you fix your hair, you\u2019re not welcome at my wedding.\u201d\nI\u2019ve still refused to get a silk press, and she\u2019s removed me from her invite list. My family who knew her (white) told me I should just get my hair done to stop the hassle. But my boyfriend and friends told me she\u2019s at fault. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I did some deep diving and found out many of the bridesmaids have links to a Neo Nazi club, and that the bride has links to a KKK \u2018comeback\u2019 club. Thank god I\u2019m not invited to that wedding. PS- thank you for your support and comments on this post.

Thanks for ur comment, much loveee \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd", "My previous post got taken down, but my mother died of cancer last month. She was a drug addict and alcoholic, and my father (black) left us so we have no contact with him or his family. My mothers side of the family also had the same habits as her, cut us off, are in jail/prison or are the snobby, stuck up, racist part of the family. I\u2019ve had words with them and they\u2019ve told me that my mum made a mistake getting with a black man and constantly called my hair disgusted. Sadly, I\u2019m not surprised they agree with her. Thank you for your comment ml \ud83e\udd0d", "Don\u2019t worry about asking questions. Me personally, I like the questions my white friends ask me about my hair as long as they\u2019re respectful :). But yes, it damages our hair severely for a long term or literally forever. As our hair is tightly coiled together, the straightener will have to go through the hair to make it pin straight so much that there is literal bright white steam coming from the hair. Silk presses are also sometimes wet with water or product, and wet hair is when the hair is most vulnerable. That\u2019s why a lot of woc wear wigs, to refrain from having to permanently damage their hair.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
