A baby that young shouldn't be in the carseat that long so you would need to take breaks as well, so the two hour car ride could become a four hour car ride depending on how baby does and the need for feeds along the way.

Otherwise, my mom wanted to be around to help. I\u2019m not saying she was at my house every day or anything but help comes in various forms.

I\u2019m a doula so my opinions are strong but even still this is a ridiculous ask. Birth is literally *traumatic*, whether you\u2019re having a c-section or a vaginal birth, and that first month with your baby is so critical for bonding and healing for you both. Why are they visiting your siblings two weeks after you\u2019ve given birth anyway and not coming to stay with you for two weeks to help you and your husband out?? It takes a village and they are being a really crappy village asking this of you.", "NTA, not even close. Your parents are HUGE assholes though! Two weeks after giving birth I was still dealing with a literal tear in my vagina. Like who wants to sit on that for 2 hours?!", "NTA. You may not even be cleared to drive again by that point. What are they thinking!?", "NTA.\nLet them be unhappy. It won't hurt you, or them. They're adults and they're just going to have to find their own way to and from the airport like everyone else. You'll have a brand new baby to care for, and every level of exhaustion that comes with it. \nThey're asking far too much and honestly should feel ashamed of themselves for doing so.\n\nAgain, I reiterate. Let them be unhappy. They can be unhappy all the way to and from the airport, but at no point should their emotional state sway your decision to put you and your baby first.", "NTA, I am not sure you would even be able to drive at that point. Definitely not with a C-section, possibly not either way. But in any event, you will be healing and exhausted. They need to figure out their own ride. \n\nThis shows you that you weren\u2019t appreciated for all the times you did this, just mad now that you aren\u2019t.

Were they the \u2018power moves over their children\u2019 type parents, telling you to do things just because? \n\nI\u2019m seriously questioning how good of parents they\u2019ve been. Prioritizing themselves without even considering that things may not go perfectly during labor. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst is pretty much my life\u2019s motto. Even with a perfect labor, you probably aren\u2019t going to be up for providing a 2hr round trip taxi service, but if you\u2019re late, or have a c-section, or any other of myriad of things that can happen you might not be ABLE to do it. \n\nThey don\u2019t seem to be putting much thought and care into your wellbeing so truthfully, don\u2019t put two thoughts towards them. Go online, purchase a doll house violin and next time they start whining hand it to them and tell them it can be their entertainment in the Uber on the way to the airport, and if they keep it up they be Ubering to the airport ad infinitum.", "NTA. Why would anyone want to dive for two hours, baby or not, when Ubers and cabs exist?!

Just let your no be a no this time.", "NTA - this may upset them but leave it at that for now because you\u2019re giving birth and have no business in giving so many explanations.

Ask them if they love the 100 dollar they would pay an uber more then they love their grandchild. \n\nEither way they answer your answer should still be no. \n\nEven if you hadn't given birth and where not taking care of a newborn, no is a full sentence.\nNTA.", "Nta. Are you even supposed to be driving at that point ?", "NTA not to mention it's a driving hazard? My SIL was advised by her doctor that she's not allowed to drive for at least a month after giving birth because the body won't reasonably be able to comfortably do a sudden stop maneuver while recovering from childbirth within that time.

Uber.", "NTA\n\nYou won't be cleared to drive by that time, especially for two hours.", "NTA But your parents are...", "NTA\n\nThey can put on their big boy/big girl pants and arrange their own transportation.", "Even if it was just an I don\u2019t want to do it kind of thing that would be totally reasonable. But 2 weeks postpartum taking care of a newborn and a toddler they should be ashamed for even asking. I\u2019m not even sure if a person would be healed enough to do that kind of drive. They have months to either find someone else or Uber. NTA in the slightest. Wishing you and the baby a healthy delivery and rest.", "NTA. You're not even supposed to drive for the first few weeks, especially if you have a c-section. (I just had a c-section on the 4th and I'm still not allowed to drive because my meds make me dizzy) \n\nYour parents need to call an Uber. Or ask a friend. Or ask ANYBODY that isn't freshly postpartum. Demanding you drive them, with a newborn and a toddler in the car, is terrible. And now them trying to guilt you? I don't think so.", "I\u2019d tell them look for another ride, but you\u2019ll try to help them if you\u2019re able to. No promises though. You may feel fine when they need a ride and welcome the chance to get out of the house. Then again you may have complications that prevent you from doing anything. Helol tell them you will but they need to schedule the fight for days that your husband is off work and if you can\u2019t take them he will.", "\"No\" is a complete sentence", "NTA. \n\nHere's a novel idea: they can drive themselves to the airport and pay for parking. OR... get a hotel room nearby that offers a \"park and stay\" deal that might be cheaper than parking. Or there might be a discount parking lot a short ride away from the airport that will shuttle you there. \n\nYeah 50 years ago people got rides to and from the airport but that is not always the case today.", "NTA.\n\nI'm going to teach you a 100% sure-fire way to deal with this situation.\n\n\"And of course you'll pick us up from the airport, and drop us off.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n'But we're coming out to see you!'\n\n\"Yes, you are.\"\n\n\"So you'll pick us up.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That's very rude and selfish.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"But we're going to be helping you and the baby, the least you can do is give us a ride!\"\n\n\"I'm sure you feel that way, but I won't be giving you a ride to and from the airport.\"\n\n\"You've never said no before.\"\n\n\"True, I haven't.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't understand what's happening.\"\n\n\"You could always take an uber, or airport shuttle, or drive yourself, whatever works best for you.\"\n\n\"What would work best for us is you dropping this attitude and driving us.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n> I respect them\n\nWhat do you mean by this?  Because what I think you mean by this is \"I've never grown past my upbringing and child's instincts to be subservient and submissive to my parents.  Having now become an adult, I haven't navigated the change from 'parent/child' to 'adult/adult,' partially because they're attempting to keep the 'parent/child' structure in place.\"", "NTA\n\nUnless they assume it'll be your husband? I mean either way they're being cheap and demanding", "NTA\n\nThe fact that they think asking you in the first place is appalling, but then to GUILT TRIP you after you've said no?? That is beyond comprehension to me.\n\nYour parent's entitlement and lack of concern for your well-being is concerning to me. Have they always been this callous to your needs? It doesn't matter if they are your parents, they can suck it up and take an Uber. Asking a postpartum woman to drag her newborn AND a toddler out into a car for 2 hours is beyond unreasonable.", "NTA   You should be healing and resting, not planning on being their driver. Also, what if for some reason you needed a c section or have a bad tear? I don\u2019t wish these for you, but there are circumstances that wouldn\u2019t allow for you to drive even if you felt like being their driver. Do what\u2019s best for you and your family.", "You are NTA. But on a practical level, this isn't workable, even beyond the driving time - sometimes babies arrive late; you may well be sleep deprived which means that it wouldn't be safe for you to drive them. So by saying no and telling them to get an uber, you are protecting them doubly; from the risk of having to find another option at short notice, and from the risk of being driven by somebody who shouldn't be on the road. \n\nYour parents are demanding much too much on this occasion.", "I\u2019m sorry but the title is hilarious. Sounds like it will take two weeks to deliver the baby. \n\nHowever NTA, two weeks after giving birth is no time and furthermore no one knows what happens until then. You could basically still be pregnant, you could have had complications, etc\u2026 your parents are just cheap and lazy. They should take a taxi or the train", "NTA", "NTA!   Some people can barely sit two weeks after birth.   They should be asking you how they can help you.  Tell them you  are happy to help them out when you can but this isn't one of those times.   What would they do if you and your husband were both sick?   Surely there is some type of backup plan.", "There\u2019s no way that this is okay. \n\nNTA", "This is not a matter of agreeing to do this or not - you physically will not be able to. It\u2019s not possible for you to do this at your stage of recovery. Imagine if your parent had a hip or knee replace the - would you even consider asking them to do this 2 weeks later? There is your answer! NTA", "Unless you have a scheduled c-section, you can't know you will be delivering on Aug. 1st and if you are having a scheduled c-section, there is no way you would be cleared to drive two weeks later. I couldn't move without pain for 3+ weeks after my c-section and didn't leave the house for over a month, other than necessary medical appointments (and I didn't drive to any of those). NTA.\n\nYour parents should not only take an Uber this time, but all future times they need a ride to the airport. The entitlement is shocking.", "NTA\n\nNo good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA and Check with your doctor.  I wasnt allowed to drive for the first 6 weeks after I delivered each of my 4 kids.  Even if you can drive, NO.  They can get an UBER ask a friend, or pay for parking like most people. Do not be guilted!", "NTA this is so sad its funny", "NTA the fact that you are even questioning this makes me think your parents regularly trample boundaries and go out of their way to make you feel guilty about completely reasonable things. You might want to explore this with a therapist if that's something you have access to.", "Girl you will still have an ice pack on your vagina. No way in hell. Plus a newborn needs to eat every two hours. \n\nNTA", "Of course you are NTA!\n\nThey are being BEYOND unreasonable.", "NTA OP.  No is a whole sentence.", "Oh man, this one carries a special place in my heart, because my parents fully expect that I or one of my siblings will move mountains to drive them to the airport on their trips. \n\nThe common refrain is that \"we'd do it for you!\", and while that may be true, you are also retired with no kids at home and no obligations, and are wealthy enough that you just went on a month long trip to Europe that you only decided to go on 3 months ago. Pay for a damn Uber, mom and dad!\n\nNTA at all, you have a freaking newborn! My wife was barely even mobile at 10 or 11 days after our second, let alone loading up both kids and driving people around, fuck that.", "NTA. Tell them no and to make other arrangements. In fact, tell them your doctor says you're not cleared to drive for x weeks after delivery (for a wide enough window for baby to come early.)  I'd imagine if you actually asked your doctor, they'd definitely be telling you not to drive so soon. \n\nYour parents sound like very entitled and rather selfish people since they expect you and your brand new baby to take them to the airport so soon after your expected delivery date.  They can Uber or park their car at the airport while they're gone but they can't take advantage of you unless you let them. (Please don't. Your and baby's health matter a lot more than your parents' vacation plans.)", "RIGHT. They\u2019re really selfish for even asking. Op you\u2019re NTA and don\u2019t worry over it for one minute. If they\u2019re help is conditional you don\u2019t need it.", "She may have stitches, she\u2019ll still be bleeding, and if she has a c-section she won\u2019t even be allowed to drive, let alone have the stamina to do so. 6 weeks after would even be quite the ask. OP\u2019s parents suck. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf you have money for a plane ticket and a trip, you better have money for a cab!", "Even where there's no public transport to an airport (criminal, but sadly common in the US), there are still airport shuttle vans - time for these parents to pick up the phone & make a reservation.", "Could you please provide evidence to support this statement? Because it\u2019s wrong. There is no U.K. regulation which says a woman can\u2019t drive for 6 weeks after having a baby. \n\nThere are various regulations about driving post surgery, and a doctor or midwife might advise against driving for a period of time for specific patients, but there is no blanket policy or regulation applying to all deliveries in the UK. \n\nHappy to be corrected if you can show me otherwise, but I have certainly not advised any woman whose baby I have delivered not to drive for any period of time.", "Edit that was supposed to say he\u2019ll tell them not helol", "I had an epidural with my first kid, and I ended up with a \"dead leg\" for about a month (it was totally numb, and walking took a lot of effort because my leg wouldn't \"automatically\" move, I had to make a conscious effort to intentionally take a step forward with that leg...if that makes any sense). I don't know how common that it, my doc just said \"it happens sometimes\". It was my right leg, so he did say it was NOT safe for me to drive (which I agreed with) and that he'd need to reassess my leg function before clearing me to drive.\n\nSo that can happen, too.\n\nBut regardless of anything, she should be at home RESTING, sheesh. I remember the trips to my first few postpartum doc visits were like torture, it was almost an hour drive to the doctor's office, and it sucked to have to sit there for so long (even as a passenger, with the seat reclined a little)...and then have to do it all over again to get back home.", "I was told no driving until after my six-week checkup \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Mind you, I didn't look into it all that closely because I don't drive, so...", "And after a c-section you cannot drive for 6 weeks!", "If you think that\u2019s a guarantee on the birth date you are gravely mistaken. Babies wait for no man.", "They typically don't schedule inductions three months in advance.", "It's not a guaranteed C-section, it's just as likely to be being induced at that date if baby doesn't come sooner by itself. We'd have to have Op confirm that for us to know for certain. However that doesn't change my judgment here of NTA. Who knows if she'll be able to drive at that point, C-section or not. It's very selfish to ask that of someone you know will have just given birth. I can understand maybe forgetting and then asking, but that reminder is where you back the fuck off and say \"no problem, I'll find another way there.\""]}
