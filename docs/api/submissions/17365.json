(Using carseat safety guidelines from the UK where I live).", ">They are very unhappy with me right now since i asked them if they can take an uber.\n\nIt seems like they're putting their own \"needs\" before their own childs health, which automatically makes them the AH. \n\n>they do help me out babysitting here and there without any charge.\n\nIsn't that them just being grandparents present in their grandchild's life?

You have a new baby and a toddler that alone is exhausting. If they are dead set offer the following compromise. IF you are going to take them to the airport they will need to come to your home the night before and be up to bottle feed breast milk to your infant so YOU can get a full night of sleep prior as it would be UNSAFE for everyone if you drive exhausted. If they are unwilling to help out so you can be safe there is your answer. If they don\u2019t get up and you have to get up with the baby, tell them they can drive themselves.", "NTA \n\nTheir request is very selfish and inconsiderate.", "I\u2019m shook that this is even a question. NTA, 100%. I\u2019ve never had any children but from everything I\u2019ve heard, I wouldn\u2019t be offering up my time to anybody unless it was absolutely necessary. They have an easy alternative and no right to be upset with you.", "absolutely NTA??? don\u2019t feel obligated to pay for their uber either, having babies is expensive. they\u2019re being rude asf, let them to figure it out", "NTA. You will be recovering and taking care of your children. Asking you to cater to their any need at the time is very selfish and entitled. You're not their personal driver. \n\nAlso about this babysitting without asking for charge thing, isn't that what families do every now and then? Help each other? Because I didn't read you charging them for the 2 hour drives you and your husband did for them, you guys helped. I wouldn't feel bad about it. \n\nWish you and the baby a healthy delivery and recovery :)", "NTA omgoodness a woman\u2019s organs literally re-shift in her body during childbirth. You will be in absolutely no condition to drive. They are delusional. This is a hill to die on.", "NTA\n\nThey should not have planned this trip so soon after you'll be giving birth. They could have planned more carefully, but they didn't, because you've always taken them whenever they asked. But this time, it's asking too much. \n\nDon't they have friends? Let them bother someone ellse. If they don't want to pay for an Uber, tell them to park in longterm parking. Can they afford that?\n\nAsk them how they'd feel if you fell asleep at the wheel and crashed because you're so tired and sleep deprived.", "NTA\n\nWhy would they even ask? They need to stop being cheap and just pay for someone else to take them instead of piling more work on you. The reasons to say no are obvious to everyone (But them apparently).", "NTA, but if you want to drive the point home, at some point put your baby and toddler in their seats and bring them for the ride. An hour with a screaming baby, potentially with a break for breast feeding on the highway, changing nappies, toddler tantrums and all the necessary distraction tricks ought to cure their desire to be driven around by you.", "NTA. Taking care of your newborn child, is a beautiful, but incredibly tiring task. With sleep deprivation, dealing with post partum, and getting to know your baby, parents often find little time to enjoy their hobbies or being with friends. It is quite an asshole move to give you even further unnecessary responsibilities when you may be physically in a weak state or when you may need some quality time for yourself.", "NTA\n\nWhen you visit people who have a newborn you are suppose to make their lives easier not give them extra work to do.", "NTA. Babe you just pushed out a baby. I'm surprised by the entitlement, cant they just book a cab? The audacity of some people. What the f did they would happen, that you would drop everything. Wasnt your mother also a new mother, why would she do this? Your parents are 100% the AH. They have taken you for granted, kindly decline and book a cab for them. I swear to god, I want to punch these people.", "NTA, but I wanna give you some unsolicited advice. Your parents don't with you in the same house. If you want to disengage from the argument, don't pick up the phone and don't reply to texts.", "Um, definitely NTA.\n\nI assume when you say you're delivering your baby 1st August that it is all planned out, probably by C-section?\n\nIf this is the case, my understanding is that you need a reasonable amount of rest afterwards.\n\nYou'll have a newborn, and a toddler - hmm, pretty sure you'll be pretty exhausted as well.\n\nI would suggest your parents find alternate arrangements - look after your own health.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA \n\nTell them it isn\u2019t even medically possible to drive that far 2 weeks after a baby. \n\nYou have zero clue if you\u2019re bleeding heavily, popped stitches or whatever. \n\nTell them to sort a bloody train or $25 airport bus", "NTA. Unless it\u2019s a planned c-section, you could deliver much closer to their trip. You\u2019ll be bleeding heavily, breastfeeding , exhausted and if you have a c-section you have to worry about blood clots on a lengthy car ride.", "In the UK you aren't even medically cleared to drive until 6 weeks after delivery.

You will be in no shape to drive. Please don\u2019t let your parents guilt trip you this summer.

They have options to get to and from the airport that aren\u2019t you.", "What is wrong with them? You want to stay home, with your baby which makes complete sense.

It is not a life or death type of situation.\n\nNTA of course", "NTA\n\nNot only may you still be bleeding, you're at a higher risk for blood clots in your legs etc. You may have trouble sitting down for so long. If you need a c section you shouldnt be driving for 8 weeks or so. You will have a NEWBORN who needs you. Are they always this selfish?", "OMFG this is insane..... noooo you are not the asshole! You are actually not allowed to have a 2 week infant in the carseat for more than 30 min. \n\nLike, are you supposed to breastfeed/mix and give the bottle while driving?  Putting the baby to sleep while driving and hopefully you won't crash the car while the baby is unfastened? \n\nI gave birth 4 months ago and no way in he** would I have done that for my parents. I would not even do it with my 4 month old baby. \n\nNTA", "NTA \nTell them politely, or impolitely, to do one.\nThey can get an uber, they can drive themselves and pay for meet and greet parking, they can... not be selfish and ask someone who hasnt just had a kid", "NTA, you just gave birth and youre still recovering so it could be harmful for you, they are extremely entitled so its time for them to learn they are not the most important people now (you have yourself and your baby to take care for) and take an uber/taci", "NTA, \n\nAlso, at two weeks after your due date you may have a 6 week old or you may still be preganant or in labour.   \n\n\nIt might be entirely fine or it might be absolutely  impossible.  You don't know what kind of baby you will have.   \n\n\nJust say no. This is an easy one as  they can't force you to drive.", "Tell them that you mentioned this to your dr and that they forbade you in strongest possible terms to drive that distance so close to giving birth, and that you & husband are doing what the dr said. I suspect that any dr would actually say this...\n\nNTA and stick to your guns.", "NTA - You are right that trying to juggle a newborn and settling your older child into the new routine as well will be hard enough without committing to a long car journey as well. A baby that young shouldn't be in the carseat that long so you would need to take breaks as well, so the two hour car ride could become a four hour car ride depending on how baby does and the need for feeds along the way. Then there is this definitely date for delivery - does this mean it is a c section birth, because if so you aren't even legally allowed to drive that soon after surgery, your insurance will not cover you. Time to tell them their last ride to the airport was their LAST ride from you to the airport as it has gone entirely unappreciated.", "NTA\n\nThey can take their car and pay for parking or get an Uber.  Don't do it.", "Facts are, they have no idea if baby will come on the due date (could be up to two weeks after), the nature of the delivery (could need emergency c section where you can\u2019t drive for 6 weeks or have tearing with is incredibly painful), not to mention sheer exhaustion of having a new born and toddler. \n\nWhat on earth is wrong with these people?? You\u2019d think they\u2019d be more concerned about staying around to help their daughter after birth rather than insisting she drive them to the airport to visit other people. \n\nOP tell them they can guilt trip you to the ends of the earth but hell will freeze over before you give them a lift, now or any other time in the future. NTA", "Plus she may not even be cleared to drive! I couldn\u2019t even sit for two hours straight after I gave birth that soon. I wasn\u2019t cleared to drive for weeks because of stitches and such.", "Why should he? They are grown adults, they can get themselves there.", "Why should either of them do it? He's probably working, but even if he is taking paternity leave, that's to bond with his child, not drive his crappy, entitled in-laws to the airport.", "Technically he can but hes going to be sleep deprived just as much as me. He gets up and changes the babys diaper, i breastfeed, then i pump and he bottle feeds while i pump/wash and he puts baby back to bed. Technically with my first i had trouble getting my first baby to latch so it was a very difficult breastfeeding journey.", "Because he isn't a taxi service and will have a 2-week-old infant, a toddler, and a wife who needs help while she recovers from childbirth.", "Likely because he too will be at home with a toddler and a newborn. He won\u2019t have the physical limitations from giving birth like OP but he will be sleep deprived. If he is fortunate to have paternity leave, it should be for taking care of his children and aiding his wife who will likely be recovering. Not for driving his in-laws to the airport.", "And giving a definite date sounds like a C section. Def not a great idea to drive 2 weeks after major abdominal surgery.", "agreed, the parents can easily book a cab. I feel terrible for OP and her husband. Do her parents have any idea how needy newborns are? and how much attention they require?", "Neither of you should do it but he's the one in a better physical condition to do so so it's weird how the focus is on you. Tell them no, you and husband will both be declining.", "Fair enough, thought I'd ask.", "That\u2019s very true. I didn\u2019t think of it that way. Regardless, I don\u2019t see what\u2019s the big deal about OP\u2019s parents getting in an Uber to go to the airport. You\u2019d think they\u2019d have more compassion for their daughter who just gave birth.", "Am I the only person wondering why they\u2019re planning on visiting their other child right after OP gives birth? I know not every family has healthy dynamics but the only reason my mom went to visit my sister a month after I gave birth was because she was also pregnant (our sons are a month apart). Otherwise, my mom wanted to be around to help. I\u2019m not saying she was at my house every day or anything but help comes in various forms. And forcing more work on top of an already exhausted parent is not one of them."]}
