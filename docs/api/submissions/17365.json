A baby that young shouldn't be in the carseat that long so you would need to take breaks as well, so the two hour car ride could become a four hour car ride depending on how baby does and the need for feeds along the way. Then there is this definitely date for delivery - does this mean it is a c section birth, because if so you aren't even legally allowed to drive that soon after surgery, your insurance will not cover you.

He won\u2019t have the physical limitations from giving birth like OP but he will be sleep deprived.

I know not every family has healthy dynamics but the only reason my mom went to visit my sister a month after I gave birth was because she was also pregnant (our sons are a month apart). Otherwise, my mom wanted to be around to help. I\u2019m not saying she was at my house every day or anything but help comes in various forms.

I\u2019m a doula so my opinions are strong but even still this is a ridiculous ask. Birth is literally *traumatic*, whether you\u2019re having a c-section or a vaginal birth, and that first month with your baby is so critical for bonding and healing for you both. Why are they visiting your siblings two weeks after you\u2019ve given birth anyway and not coming to stay with you for two weeks to help you and your husband out?? It takes a village and they are being a really crappy village asking this of you.", "NTA, not even close. Your parents are HUGE assholes though! Two weeks after giving birth I was still dealing with a literal tear in my vagina. Like who wants to sit on that for 2 hours?!", "NTA. You may not even be cleared to drive again by that point. What are they thinking!?", "NTA.\nLet them be unhappy. It won't hurt you, or them. They're adults and they're just going to have to find their own way to and from the airport like everyone else. You'll have a brand new baby to care for, and every level of exhaustion that comes with it. \nThey're asking far too much and honestly should feel ashamed of themselves for doing so.\n\nAgain, I reiterate. Let them be unhappy. They can be unhappy all the way to and from the airport, but at no point should their emotional state sway your decision to put you and your baby first.", "NTA, I am not sure you would even be able to drive at that point. Definitely not with a C-section, possibly not either way. But in any event, you will be healing and exhausted. They need to figure out their own ride. \n\nThis shows you that you weren\u2019t appreciated for all the times you did this, just mad now that you aren\u2019t.

Were they the \u2018power moves over their children\u2019 type parents, telling you to do things just because? \n\nI\u2019m seriously questioning how good of parents they\u2019ve been. Prioritizing themselves without even considering that things may not go perfectly during labor. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst is pretty much my life\u2019s motto. Even with a perfect labor, you probably aren\u2019t going to be up for providing a 2hr round trip taxi service, but if you\u2019re late, or have a c-section, or any other of myriad of things that can happen you might not be ABLE to do it. \n\nThey don\u2019t seem to be putting much thought and care into your wellbeing so truthfully, don\u2019t put two thoughts towards them. Go online, purchase a doll house violin and next time they start whining hand it to them and tell them it can be their entertainment in the Uber on the way to the airport, and if they keep it up they be Ubering to the airport ad infinitum.", "NTA. Why would anyone want to dive for two hours, baby or not, when Ubers and cabs exist?!

Just let your no be a no this time.", "NTA - this may upset them but leave it at that for now because you\u2019re giving birth and have no business in giving so many explanations.

She still took an Uber to the airport because she understood how difficult it would be for me.", "NTA but your parents sure are.

Ask them if they love the 100 dollar they would pay an uber more then they love their grandchild. \n\nEither way they answer your answer should still be no. \n\nEven if you hadn't given birth and where not taking care of a newborn, no is a full sentence.\nNTA.", "Nta. Are you even supposed to be driving at that point ?", "NTA not to mention it's a driving hazard? My SIL was advised by her doctor that she's not allowed to drive for at least a month after giving birth because the body won't reasonably be able to comfortably do a sudden stop maneuver while recovering from childbirth within that time.
