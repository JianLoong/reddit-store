Taking care of your newborn child, is a beautiful, but incredibly tiring task. With sleep deprivation, dealing with post partum, and getting to know your baby, parents often find little time to enjoy their hobbies or being with friends.

I suspect that any dr would actually say this...\n\nNTA and stick to your guns.", "NTA - You are right that trying to juggle a newborn and settling your older child into the new routine as well will be hard enough without committing to a long car journey as well. A baby that young shouldn't be in the carseat that long so you would need to take breaks as well, so the two hour car ride could become a four hour car ride depending on how baby does and the need for feeds along the way. Then there is this definitely date for delivery - does this mean it is a c section birth, because if so you aren't even legally allowed to drive that soon after surgery, your insurance will not cover you. Time to tell them their last ride to the airport was their LAST ride from you to the airport as it has gone entirely unappreciated.", "NTA\n\nThey can take their car and pay for parking or get an Uber.  Don't do it.", "Facts are, they have no idea if baby will come on the due date (could be up to two weeks after), the nature of the delivery (could need emergency c section where you can\u2019t drive for 6 weeks or have tearing with is incredibly painful), not to mention sheer exhaustion of having a new born and toddler. \n\nWhat on earth is wrong with these people?? You\u2019d think they\u2019d be more concerned about staying around to help their daughter after birth rather than insisting she drive them to the airport to visit other people. \n\nOP tell them they can guilt trip you to the ends of the earth but hell will freeze over before you give them a lift, now or any other time in the future.

He's probably working, but even if he is taking paternity leave, that's to bond with his child, not drive his crappy, entitled in-laws to the airport.", "Technically he can but hes going to be sleep deprived just as much as me. He gets up and changes the babys diaper, i breastfeed, then i pump and he bottle feeds while i pump/wash and he puts baby back to bed. Technically with my first i had trouble getting my first baby to latch so it was a very difficult breastfeeding journey.", "Because he isn't a taxi service and will have a 2-week-old infant, a toddler, and a wife who needs help while she recovers from childbirth.", "Likely because he too will be at home with a toddler and a newborn. He won\u2019t have the physical limitations from giving birth like OP but he will be sleep deprived. If he is fortunate to have paternity leave, it should be for taking care of his children and aiding his wife who will likely be recovering. Not for driving his in-laws to the airport.", "And giving a definite date sounds like a C section. Def not a great idea to drive 2 weeks after major abdominal surgery.", "agreed, the parents can easily book a cab. I feel terrible for OP and her husband. Do her parents have any idea how needy newborns are? and how much attention they require?", "Neither of you should do it but he's the one in a better physical condition to do so so it's weird how the focus is on you.

I know not every family has healthy dynamics but the only reason my mom went to visit my sister a month after I gave birth was because she was also pregnant (our sons are a month apart). Otherwise, my mom wanted to be around to help. I\u2019m not saying she was at my house every day or anything but help comes in various forms. And forcing more work on top of an already exhausted parent is not one of them.", "NTA - sometimes it feels like people want to treat family like a free service that can be called on any time and it is expected that you will be happy to even have been asked to help out !\n\n\nThen they pull out the :\nWhy won't you do a super inconvenient thing? \" I would do it for you !\" \n\nI would never be a big enough jerk to ask that same favor so whether or not you would is meaningless !\n\n\nFocus on you !", "NTA. You will need time to recover, and unless you have a scheduled c section, the baby could arrive at any time. Doesn't the airport have parking? They can drive themselves!", "NTA\n\nThis is a very unreasonable request. Also babies can come up to two weeks late so you may actually be giving birth", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are narcissists.", "NTA and more. Don't let them guilt trip you. Your new born will need you then. It's unsafe for you to do that too. You may be sleep deprived. Your body might have not recovered yet from the delivery.", "NTA.  Taking an Uber or other hired transport is the logical thing to do.  They\u2019re being brats.", "NTA times a million. I\u2019m a doula so my opinions are strong but even still this is a ridiculous ask. Birth is literally *traumatic*, whether you\u2019re having a c-section or a vaginal birth, and that first month with your baby is so critical for bonding and healing for you both. Why are they visiting your siblings two weeks after you\u2019ve given birth anyway and not coming to stay with you for two weeks to help you and your husband out?? It takes a village and they are being a really crappy village asking this of you.", "NTA, not even close. Your parents are HUGE assholes though! Two weeks after giving birth I was still dealing with a literal tear in my vagina. Like who wants to sit on that for 2 hours?!", "NTA. You may not even be cleared to drive again by that point. What are they thinking!?", "NTA.\nLet them be unhappy. It won't hurt you, or them. They're adults and they're just going to have to find their own way to and from the airport like everyone else. You'll have a brand new baby to care for, and every level of exhaustion that comes with it. \nThey're asking far too much and honestly should feel ashamed of themselves for doing so.\n\nAgain, I reiterate. Let them be unhappy. They can be unhappy all the way to and from the airport, but at no point should their emotional state sway your decision to put you and your baby first.", "NTA, I am not sure you would even be able to drive at that point. Definitely not with a C-section, possibly not either way. But in any event, you will be healing and exhausted. They need to figure out their own ride. \n\nThis shows you that you weren\u2019t appreciated for all the times you did this, just mad now that you aren\u2019t. So you can\u2019t win here.", "NTA but I\u2019d send my husband if they babysit for free", "NTA - they\u2019re selfish little shits throwing toddler tantrums. Were they the \u2018power moves over their children\u2019 type parents, telling you to do things just because? \n\nI\u2019m seriously questioning how good of parents they\u2019ve been. Prioritizing themselves without even considering that things may not go perfectly during labor. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst is pretty much my life\u2019s motto. Even with a perfect labor, you probably aren\u2019t going to be up for providing a 2hr round trip taxi service, but if you\u2019re late, or have a c-section, or any other of myriad of things that can happen you might not be ABLE to do it. \n\nThey don\u2019t seem to be putting much thought and care into your wellbeing so truthfully, don\u2019t put two thoughts towards them. Go online, purchase a doll house violin and next time they start whining hand it to them and tell them it can be their entertainment in the Uber on the way to the airport, and if they keep it up they be Ubering to the airport ad infinitum.", "NTA. Why would anyone want to dive for two hours, baby or not, when Ubers and cabs exist?! It\u2019s downright rude to ask anybody to do this (unless emergency), especially if they have kids or have just given birth. Anyone who asks this has no respect for your time.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. That is all.", "NTA. You will be still healing, coming to terms with your new life.", "NTA it may not be possible for you to even sit upright in one position that long so soon after giving birth. I would even think that it's dangerous. You should call your doctor and ask them about this.", "NTA. Tell your parents this is what Uber was invented for!", "Are they insane?\n\nI mean, literally, what is wrong with your parents? Are they extra dumb or something?\n\nYou should not be driving them, for free, like some taxi. They should be taking care of **you.**\n\nThey can take an Uber, a bus, a taxi, any other thing. What is wrong with them? Are they insane?\n\nNTA.", "FYI if you have a c-section, planned or emergency, you will NOT be able to drive for the first 6 weeks postpartum. It\u2019s s liability & you won\u2019t be covered by insurance if you crash.\n\nIt\u2019s also not safe for baby to be in a car seat that long. Positional asphyxiation is a thing. \n\nBook them an Uber or a Taxi if they\u2019re that incompetent they can\u2019t organise their own transport, but don\u2019t drive them.\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If it's natural birth, then you are hoping baby will come the 1st. Baby can come a week later, then  you will be 1 week post partum. If it's a c-section, you shouldn't be driving until 4 weeks post partum. This is a big no. This sounds like a them problem and not a you problem. Dont make it your problem. Just let your no be a no this time.", "NTA - this may upset them but leave it at that for now because you\u2019re giving birth and have no business in giving so many explanations. Uber is an extremely viable and suitable option - I mean, are they looking forward to your company through the ride otherwise? While you\u2019ll be a train wreck? Jesus!", "NTA\n\nThey want a 2-hour ride to visit somebody else 2 weeks after your due date?!!!\n\nNO. Tell them no. They can make other arrangements. You don't even know for sure if you will be out of the hospital by then, delivering a baby can go wrong in all kinds of ways, what if you have a C-Section and haven't recovered enough to drive? No, no, no. The last thing you need is worrying about being a cab driver for your parents just after getting a baby. This is an insane thing to ask, never mind guilt tripping you about it.", "NTA. My mom came to visit me after birth for 5 weeks and actually stayed with me and was incredibly helpful. She still took an Uber to the airport because she understood how difficult it would be for me.", "NTA but your parents sure are.  There is no way you need to be driving them to the airport with a newborn and toddler 2 weeks after giving birth.  I can\u2019t believe they even asked.  Do not do it.  Either they can get an Uber or stay home", "OP parents can rent a car and drop it off at the airport, then do the same when they return.", "NTA.  I'm sorry your parents are so unsympathetic. What in the world is wrong with them? I would think that the well being of you and your baby would matter to them.\nI would look up a park and fly motel. They can drive themselves the day before their flight and leave the car. Thousands of people use them", "NTA!!\nLabour and childbirth are quite taxing on the body, you'll be both recovering and learning how to handle a new born.\nThey are the assholes", "NTA. So inconsiderate. Just do what you need to do for yourself and baby. They\u2019re just going to have to get over it.", "NTA also if you end up with a c- section you shouldn\u2019t be driving at that time. \nNo, is a complete sentence.\nPlus your baby could come late so who knows\u2026  \nDepending on your relationship with your parents I would be like I can send you videos of births and C-sections if they forgot what it\u2019s like but that\u2019s just me being petty. My family wouldn\u2019t expect anything from me for months after having a baby.", "Of course NTA. Can you have your husband run interference for you? Are they more likely to listen to him? I wonder if it will be helpful for him to put his foot down and say \"My wife isn't doing that\" to take the heat off of you.", "That's no compromise. She'll have to host them- which means cleaning, cooking and everything else while they 'help' by holding the baby and probably agitating the toddler.", "I mostly agree with you but some people have scheduled c-sections or inductions just fyi", "Yes I know, I had two natural births and two planned c sections due to complications. I just feel in this particular instance, if she were having a planned c section, she would have said as it would be massively relevant to the time scale of her recovery.", "You can have a scheduled c section and that is still not when your baby is born. \n\nYour comment isn't the gotcha that you think it is. \n\nBabies come when babies come.", "It is against doctor's orders and dangerous AF to drive that soon after major surgery. \n\nMy father never found a rule he didn't like to break. He still doesn't wear a seat belt. But even HE refrained from driving after his kidney was removed."]}
