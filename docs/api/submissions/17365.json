A baby that young shouldn't be in the carseat that long so you would need to take breaks as well, so the two hour car ride could become a four hour car ride depending on how baby does and the need for feeds along the way.

Otherwise, my mom wanted to be around to help. I\u2019m not saying she was at my house every day or anything but help comes in various forms.

I\u2019m a doula so my opinions are strong but even still this is a ridiculous ask. Birth is literally *traumatic*, whether you\u2019re having a c-section or a vaginal birth, and that first month with your baby is so critical for bonding and healing for you both. Why are they visiting your siblings two weeks after you\u2019ve given birth anyway and not coming to stay with you for two weeks to help you and your husband out?? It takes a village and they are being a really crappy village asking this of you.", "NTA, not even close. Your parents are HUGE assholes though! Two weeks after giving birth I was still dealing with a literal tear in my vagina. Like who wants to sit on that for 2 hours?!", "NTA. You may not even be cleared to drive again by that point. What are they thinking!?", "NTA.\nLet them be unhappy. It won't hurt you, or them. They're adults and they're just going to have to find their own way to and from the airport like everyone else. You'll have a brand new baby to care for, and every level of exhaustion that comes with it. \nThey're asking far too much and honestly should feel ashamed of themselves for doing so.\n\nAgain, I reiterate. Let them be unhappy. They can be unhappy all the way to and from the airport, but at no point should their emotional state sway your decision to put you and your baby first.", "NTA, I am not sure you would even be able to drive at that point. Definitely not with a C-section, possibly not either way. But in any event, you will be healing and exhausted. They need to figure out their own ride. \n\nThis shows you that you weren\u2019t appreciated for all the times you did this, just mad now that you aren\u2019t.

Prioritizing themselves without even considering that things may not go perfectly during labor. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst is pretty much my life\u2019s motto. Even with a perfect labor, you probably aren\u2019t going to be up for providing a 2hr round trip taxi service, but if you\u2019re late, or have a c-section, or any other of myriad of things that can happen you might not be ABLE to do it. \n\nThey don\u2019t seem to be putting much thought and care into your wellbeing so truthfully, don\u2019t put two thoughts towards them. Go online, purchase a doll house violin and next time they start whining hand it to them and tell them it can be their entertainment in the Uber on the way to the airport, and if they keep it up they be Ubering to the airport ad infinitum.", "NTA. Why would anyone want to dive for two hours, baby or not, when Ubers and cabs exist?!

Just let your no be a no this time.", "NTA - this may upset them but leave it at that for now because you\u2019re giving birth and have no business in giving so many explanations.

Ask them if they love the 100 dollar they would pay an uber more then they love their grandchild. \n\nEither way they answer your answer should still be no. \n\nEven if you hadn't given birth and where not taking care of a newborn, no is a full sentence.\nNTA.", "Nta. Are you even supposed to be driving at that point ?", "NTA not to mention it's a driving hazard?

It's not anyone else's responsibility to get me to the airport, I'll have to factor in that cost when I travel.\n\nAdd having recently given birth, and really, you should probably not drive more than necessary so soon after a major medical event (giving birth is a major medical event given what the body goes through), and then afterwards you probably won't sleep well due to having a baby, plus have an unusual mix of hormones raging through you. Driving in that state, to the airport no less, sounds like hell. No thanks.", "I took my newborn by myself on a 7 hr round trip drive to see family.

In sum, you\u2019re in no way an asshole", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are being incredibly entitled and selfish. Your baby and yourself should be your only priority.

Because you won\u2019t know until closer to your due date or at time of birth, you would not be able to give them notice. Telling them no now is your notice. Even if you don\u2019t have a C-section, it is unwise to commit yourself so soon after giving birth. Shame on your parents for guilting you and trying to force you to do something unsafe", "NTA, though if you are worried they might cut off childcare and it's something you need and can't lose. Maybe split their Uber for them? I'm only suggesting it if they are the vindictive type and their help is something you can't be without.", "NTA. You just can't make plans around a babys due date.

You probably won\u2019t even be medically cleared to drive yet. Your parents can absolutely take an Uber, they just don\u2019t *want* to. You are NTA, it\u2019s not your job to bend over backwards to make sure your parents always get what they want. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is a bit of a novel but I think you need it. It\u2019s time to 1) start setting boundaries with your parents when they are being unreasonable/demanding, and 2) let go of your guilt over saying \u201cno\u201d to them. \n\nSince your parents have made it clear that they are unwilling to be reasonable or respectful it\u2019s time to stop [JADE-ing (Justify Argue Defend Explain)](https://childdevelopmentinfo.com/family-building/jade-an-easy-mnemonic-for-difficult-family-members/#gs.j7s21h) your decision not to drive them to the airport. You don\u2019t need their permission or approval in this matter, *so don\u2019t act like you do by treating this subject as if it\u2019s up for debate because it\u2019s not*. \n\nMost people have the urge to explain ourselves in a desire to be understood and to avoid potential hurt feelings. When you try to Justify/Argue/Defend/Explain why you made a particular decision to a regular respectful person they\u2019ll listen to your reasons, respect your decision, and move on. When you try to Justify/Argue/Defend/Explain why you made a particular decision to a pushy/unreasonable/boundary stomping person *they\u2019ll* see your reasons only as an opening for debate and something for them to argue against in order to change your mind to do what *they* want instead. **They don\u2019t care** what you want or what your reasonings are, ALL they care about is getting their way and they will use *any* bits of information you give them to try to manipulate, argue away, guilt trip, and brow beat you until until you eventually cave under pressure to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d. *It is pointless to JADE yourself to them* ***so don\u2019t!***\n\nStop engaging in discussions about this topic with your parents, instead shut it down and change the subject every time. Keep your reply as a firm \u201cNO\u201d that contains no details/explanations for your mom to argue against. Something like \u201cthat\u2019s not an option\u201d, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work for me\u201d, \u201cmy decision is final\u201d, \u201cthis isn\u2019t up for discussion\u201d, and the simple but classic \u201cno\u201d are all phrases that work great. \n\nThe next time they demand that you drive them to the airport: \u201c**No, that\u2019s not an option. This is not up for discussion**.\u201d They don\u2019t need any more information from you than that (*because by now they\u2019ve already heard everything you have to say and decided to argue again anyways*), so **do not elaborate further**. When they wants to know why you won\u2019t do as they demand: \u201c**Because that\u2019s not an option.**\u201d Keep using a variation of that reply no matter what: It\u2019s not an option *because it\u2019s not an option*. Why is it not an option? *Because it\u2019s not*. Repeat ad nauseam. It shuts down the argument because there\u2019s nothing for them to latch onto to try and change your mind.\n\n*Be ready and willing to leave (or hang up) if they won\u2019t drop the subject after 1-2 shut downs*. DO NOT engage with their guilt tripping, accusations of \u201cselfishness\u201d, put downs and insults, or sob stories. It\u2019s all just manipulation tactics and crocodile tears. Continue to firmly shut them down: \u201c***No.*** **I won\u2019t discuss this with you any further. Drop the subject or I will have to leave/hang up.**.\u201d Then *immediately* follow through if they continue to refuse to respect your decision: \u201c**I asked you to stop. Since you refuse to respect my request I\u2019m going to leave/hang up. Goodbye.**\u201d Then promptly walk away (or hang up) without letting them get another word in.  \n\nBoundary stomping requires consequences, you have to teach your parents that if they won\u2019t respect you and your boundaries then you\u2019re not going to stick around to continue the conversation.\n\n\u2014-\n\nAs for the guilt you feel: Guilt can be a helpful feeling when you\u2019ve wronged someone, because it helps you hopefully make better choices in the future and grow to be a better person. However there are times when guilt is what my therapist called \u201c**inappropriate guilt**\u201d, and **that\u2019s when you feel guilty over things you don\u2019t need to, don\u2019t deserve to, or shouldn\u2019t ever feel guilty for.** Oftentimes we feel this inappropriate guilt when others get upset over or strongly disagree with our choices/boundaries, especially if they also guilt trip us about it. \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with inappropriate guilt many times in my life before. My therapist recommended me to go through these questions and phrases when I\u2019m wondering if my guilt is \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d guilt:\n\n-\tWhy are you feeling guilty? \n-\tDid you actually do something wrong or cause real harm to the other person? (*And no, them being inconvenienced or upset that they didn\u2019t get their way is NOT harm!*)\n-\tOr did you do something innocuous (not harmful) that the other person just doesn\u2019t *want* you to do?\n-\tDoes the other person have an ulterior motive for making you feel guilty?\n-\tIs the other person a reasonable, trustworthy person? Or do they have a history of manipulation, selfishness, guilt tripping, mooching, and/or cruel behavior?\n\nIf you *did* do wrong then apologize and make things right with the person you wronged/harmed. \n\n**However** if you *didn\u2019t* do anything wrong and they\u2019re guilt tripping you then reminding yourself of these phrases might help:\n\n-\tYou\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions or how they **choose** to react to your decisions. If your actions aren\u2019t harming anyone, yet someone else **chooses** to be upset over it anyways, then that\u2019s *their* choice to make- *let them be upset!*\n-\tYou are not responsible for other people\u2019s (or their children\u2019s) mental, emotional, financial, or physical well-being. It\u2019s on *them* to take care of themselves and their dependents, not you.\n-\tIt\u2019s ok to disagree with other people over your choices.\n-\tIt\u2019s ok for other people to be upset over your choices. \n-\tIt\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to something that harms or inconveniences you, or even if you just plain don\u2019t want to do it. \n-\tJust because someone is upset it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you did anything wrong. Sometimes people get upset just because they\u2019re not getting their way. \n-\tIt\u2019s not your job to fix the situation or their emotions. Their emotions are *their* responsibility to manage.\n-\t**Being a good person does not equal being a doormat!** You can be a kind, generous person *and* set healthy boundaries, refuse to tolerate disrespect towards you/your loved ones, and not allow others to take advantage of you. \n-\tYou matter too! Prioritizing your mental, emotional, financial, and physical well-being is important. \n-\t*Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.* If helping them hurts you, then say no!\n\nYou are prioritizing your health and the health of your newborn- if that\u2019s what makes your parents upset then they don\u2019t have your best interests at heart.

I also had a c section, and while I personally felt okay driving myself and my newborn to our 6 week midwife appointment, it was really hard getting the baby in and out of the car due to the incision/weakness in my core! And that was like a 15 minute drive. Hell no would I have been comfortable driving a four hour round trip! You\u2019ll probably still be *actively bleeding* at that point!
