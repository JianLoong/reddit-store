It was over a month of daily harassment over phone, on social media, and at times even in public. She even threw a stone through my window and vandalized my car in my driveway. She was caught on security camera and charges were brought against her. \n\nI had to spend a lot on lawyers to threaten legal suits against both the husband and wife to get her to back off. She was having some sort of a mental breakdown and went into a psych hold. Her meds helped and she agreed to stop and accepted that I wasn\u2019t the involved party. As part of our legal agreement she made social media posts apologizing and clearing my name and some financial recompense for damages caused.\n\nDuring all this, my fiance (32M) was of no help at all. We lived together and he wouldn\u2019t do anything to support me. When I got accosted in public places, he\u2019d simply leave. When our condo was attacked, he got in his car and left to stay with a friend. He said it was too embarrassing for him to stay around. He didn\u2019t seem to realize that I was scared and felt my life was in danger. He knew that I was innocent in this, and yet he didn\u2019t stop his friends and family from believing the worst about me and making snide comments at me. I begged him to help me and he\u2019d act frustrated as if there was nothing he could do here.\n\nWhen the woman harassing me made the apology posts, I forwarded them everywhere explaining how I got caught up in someone else\u2019s tragedy and I called my fiance a coward for his behavior. Which was also my way of publicly breaking up with him.\n\nMy parents were very supportive of me throughout this mess and they gave me money for the lawyer\u2019s retainer. But they didn\u2019t like my public FU to my ex. They said that it was petty of me and asked me to be nicer and not break up. I did eventually remove his name from my posts, but I was not interested in any relationship with him anymore. \n\nAfter this all went away I was still pretty traumatized and paranoid. I quit my job and I couldn\u2019t stand living with my ex. My best friend lived a few states away and she invited me to stay with her as a change of scenery. It was the break I needed. I also found a great job there while I was visiting and decided to settle there. I\u2019ve been living in this town since then.\n\nI have booked tickets to visit my family for christmas and last night my mother told me that my Ex is staying with them as a house guest. My mother said he wasn\u2019t doing too well after I left and my parents let him move in with them.

There were photos of my ex-husband\u2013this person who had just eviscerated me\u2013lovingly displayed around her home as if nothing had happened. Talk about a punch to the gut. Even worse, she had invited my ex-husband to also vacation at her home, without asking me if that was okay beforehand. And there was no fucking way I was going to stay in that house with him there so I ended up flying home without my kids while he stayed there with them for a week. She proceeded to invite him and my kids to vacation at her home every summer thereafter. So I stopped going to see her. I was largely estranged from her for seven years as a result. I think she finally she came to understand that I was never going to visit her again until she stopped inviting him. She never apologized for her treatment of me after the divorce and didn't even have the courage or decency to invite me back into her life herself. (Instead, she made my kids beg me to go visit her.) She is back in my life now but will never be in my inner sanctum again. I would NEVER side with someone else over my kids. It is my job as a parent to be there for them and support them no matter what. My mother was either hopelessly tone deaf and clueless to behave as she did; or she was intentionally cruel. Either way, it lowered my opinion of her. \n\nMy mother's behavior was not the behavior of a caring and loving mother. Your parents' behavior in this moment is not caring and loving towards you, either. How can they not understand that having your ex living in their home would be hurtful to you?! And your boyfriend's behavior was not kind and caring towards you, either. You are NTA. Decline to visit your parents. If people are not supportive to you, it is okay to deny them your presence. Eventually, your parents will get the message. And eventually they will come to realize that they would prefer to have you in their lives rather than having your ex in their home.
