It was over a month of daily harassment over phone, on social media, and at times even in public. She even threw a stone through my window and vandalized my car in my driveway. She was caught on security camera and charges were brought against her. \n\nI had to spend a lot on lawyers to threaten legal suits against both the husband and wife to get her to back off. She was having some sort of a mental breakdown and went into a psych hold. Her meds helped and she agreed to stop and accepted that I wasn\u2019t the involved party. As part of our legal agreement she made social media posts apologizing and clearing my name and some financial recompense for damages caused.\n\nDuring all this, my fiance (32M) was of no help at all. We lived together and he wouldn\u2019t do anything to support me. When I got accosted in public places, he\u2019d simply leave. When our condo was attacked, he got in his car and left to stay with a friend. He said it was too embarrassing for him to stay around. He didn\u2019t seem to realize that I was scared and felt my life was in danger. He knew that I was innocent in this, and yet he didn\u2019t stop his friends and family from believing the worst about me and making snide comments at me. I begged him to help me and he\u2019d act frustrated as if there was nothing he could do here.\n\nWhen the woman harassing me made the apology posts, I forwarded them everywhere explaining how I got caught up in someone else\u2019s tragedy and I called my fiance a coward for his behavior. Which was also my way of publicly breaking up with him.\n\nMy parents were very supportive of me throughout this mess and they gave me money for the lawyer\u2019s retainer. But they didn\u2019t like my public FU to my ex. They said that it was petty of me and asked me to be nicer and not break up. I did eventually remove his name from my posts, but I was not interested in any relationship with him anymore. \n\nAfter this all went away I was still pretty traumatized and paranoid. I quit my job and I couldn\u2019t stand living with my ex. My best friend lived a few states away and she invited me to stay with her as a change of scenery. It was the break I needed. I also found a great job there while I was visiting and decided to settle there. I\u2019ve been living in this town since then.\n\nI have booked tickets to visit my family for christmas and last night my mother told me that my Ex is staying with them as a house guest. My mother said he wasn\u2019t doing too well after I left and my parents let him move in with them. I don\u2019t want to see my Ex and I am pretty hurt that my parents are taking care of this man who did not stand by me. \n\nWIBTA if I tell my parents I am not visiting as long as he\u2019s in their home?", "created_utc": 1671298390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zobed0/aita_for_hating_that_my_ex_is_living_with_my/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your ex left you alone in dangerous situations and your parents let him MOVE IN? \n\nJeez. I\u2019m am sorry. They all suck.", "Absolutely NTA. Wtf are your parents thinking? Do they love your ex more than they love you? Let them know your boundaries and if they can't respect them then that's their loss/choice. Again I'm seriously so sorry they did this to you. \n\nPersonal story: me and my mom are friendly with my sisters exes because she has children with them. If there was no long term commitment in the relationship they have no ties to that person and should be loyal to their child. And my mother would absolutely NEVER let one of them move in. Shed try to help them find a place or something but never bringing them into my sister's space.", "NTA. He left you all alone when you were getting harassed and still didn't think that he would be dumped? The audacity. Your parents are being A h here. Tell them you won't be visiting if your ex is there. Just let them choose b/w you and your ex. They shouldn't be supporting a man who left their daughter all alone when she was being attacked.", "NTA\n\nThere are lots of posts here on AITA of OPs whose parents stay in touch with exes.\n\nThe general consensus is - you can't control what your parents do, but you can control what YOU do (by not visiting while they're there).\n\nIt **also** could be the case that they're trying to get the two of you **back together** \\- that would not surprise me.\n\nSo tell them that you will not be able to come home, wish them a happy holiday, and don't get sucked into any arguments or blame.\n\nStay strong - you're 100% in the right!", "NTA wouldn't visit with that spineless wonder in the same house. How long has he been and how long do they plan on housing that Jellyfish?", "NTA -- that's appalling.", "NTA. What the hell are your parents thinking?", "NTA. Also how long have your parents been housing him? Why didn\u2019t they tell you about it sooner? It sounds like they\u2019re planning to try and get you two back together, only telling you this *right* before you\u2019re coming to visit.", "NTA.   Clearly they showed you whom they value.  I\u2019d not visit and go low contact as well.  He has his own parents to turn to, why does he have to stay with them?", "Nta I wouldn't go", "NTA. He left you when you weren't safe because no one can tell what she could do if she had bad day or anything so it's normal that you don't want to see him. And it's not your fault that he isn't doing well so why are your parents helping him out when he didn't give a fuck about what people tell about you do what can happen to you.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t go visit either. Spend holidays with friends or family who support you.", "First of all I'm sorry all that nonsense happened to you!! Second, good on you for leaving, dude definitley sounds like a... let's go with coward, like you said lol.  \n\nNTA, your parents are all the way out of line here and have some kind of weird agenda. Continue to do what's best for you.", "NTA\\_ and you should consider going low/no contact with your parents. Even if he weren't living with them, your ex was being terrible and selfish.\n\nThis would be messy af, but I would consider putting your parents on blast too.", "NTA.\n\nWhen you needed him the most, he flaked.    You are not required to feel empathy for him because now he has regrets, nor should you be expected to hang out with him because your parents didn't agree with your breakup and feel bad for him for some reason.\n\nBe nice but firm, and hopefully you can have an enjoyable holiday with friends or other family members.", "NTA the ex is the cowardly lion from OZ. Best to leave him there with the 'rents'", "NTA. That\u2019s insane! You\u2019re ex should be an adult and figure out a place to stay either on his own or with his own family. Sounds to me like he\u2019s manipulated your parents into thinking he\u2019s the victim here. Idk if he\u2019s living there rent free but damn this guy has some gall.", "Absolutely NTA. Your parents have betrayed you. It sucks that these 3 people have let you down when you needed them the most. Your ex when you were being harassed and your parents through your break up. You deserve better. \n\nAlso, I wouldn\u2019t have removed his name from the posts. He is a coward and the worst part is he allowed people in your life to think the worst of you.", "NTA. Your parents and your ex all suck.", "Nope, NTA. Cancel your tickets, or change them to somewhere nice for a spring vacation. Cut contact until the sorry excuse for a man gets out of your parent's house and out of your life completely.", "YWNBTA\n\nYour parents are disgusting, they chose your ex over you\n\nDitch them", "NTA. Save the money. They invited your ex to stay with them or he asked and they agreed, idk which is worse. It's pretty clearly an attempt at getting you to feel guilt and take him back. After everything that has happened, how could you though? He didn't push you in the water but he didn't throw you a life vest or jump in to save you either. He just walked away. That's simply not acceptable from a partner especially when they know better. Don't fall into their trap. Spend the holidays celebrating your new life. I hope it goes great for you. Congrats on getting through to the other side.  Merry Christmas and Happy holidays!", "YWNBTA. Make it clear to them how upset and disappointed you are in them for choosing him over you. I could say more about him, but I want to keep my post civil. I mean, How dare he!", "NTA I'd go further and say unless he leaves their home now you will go no contact, and it wont be just this christmas but everyone and if you have kids they wont be grandparents. Thats absolutely awful them inviting him to move in - its a major betrayal and for them to expect you to sit there with him over Xmas - thats disgusting.", "NTA. Your parents have every right to help anyone they want, but at the same vein *you don't have to visit them*. You can lay down this boundary and keep enforcing it. Your parents will get the message eventually and your ex will move out at some point. If there is any silver lining here, at least they told before you got there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
