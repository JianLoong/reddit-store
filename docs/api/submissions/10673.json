Just realize that your mom might not want to discuss it with you and that's her right, if not totally fair to you.  Also, be careful, you might not like the answers you get.  I am not 100% sure that my dad is my biological dad and have avoided getting a DNA test because ultimately I didnt really want to know.", "NTA but be careful with the information.  There could be a total valid reason as to why your mom would refuse to tell you, such as your bio dad was abusive to her, it could be rape, or your bio dad/his family could be very toxic.  Just remember that blood doesn\u2019t necessarily equal family.  If anything do the 23 and me so you can also get the medical information you are probably lacking from not knowing your bio dad\u2019s family.", "NTA, but does your mother know the people you told? If so, you would be TA if it got back to her and she found out from them. This really isn\u2019t something to feel bad about in general.

You are free to find your own answers. She has kept everything behind your back. Why are you worried about what she doesn't know? Her refusal to answer is all the permission you'll ever need.", "NTA. This is your life and family history, and if your relationship with your mother is conditional upon you not asking these very fair questions, that's on your mom for being wildly unreasonable (and also a long-time liar). As long as you're willing to accept the consequences (however your mom reacts), then go for it.", "NTA: Dude, you\u2019re 24 and have been living on your own for a while. Go take the DNA test if you want to. It may or may not help solve the mystery, but that\u2019s ok.

There\u2019s nothing nicer than having a piece of mind about your beginnings", "NTA, you have a right to know where you're coming from. She should have told you way earlier.", "NTA, find your family!", "NTA. You asked your mother and she refused to tell you. Before moving ahead, though, be clear with yourself about your expectations and how they may differ from the \"real\" world. Do you envision a loving reunion with your bio-father and a happily ever after? What if he has other children who don't know about you and get angry or want nothing to do with you?

He may have his own family and be hiding or ignorant of your existence.\n\nDNA tests only mean something if there is the right sample to try against.  What if this friend isn\u2019t your dad?  What if your paternal family is not on any of the common DNA banks like 23 and Me.", "NAH - if your mom is saying he\u2019s not a good person there\u2019s a good chance he was abusive to her and that\u2019s why she won\u2019t tell you who it is.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have to decide if finding your biological father is more important than your relationship with your mom and step dad.", "NTA.

She may not want to go into particulars; but she is morally obligated to tell the man who his dad is.", "This is my concern as well. Mom might be protecting you.", "No, the people I have talk to are my fiance who tries to make me feel better and encourages me to do what I feel I need to and my best friend who thinks my mom is TA for continously lying and trying to hide it from me.

My first step is to do the DNA test when it arrives and then to check out his life and hopefully just reach out to him one on one and let him decide whether to invite me to be apart or not. I just want the chance to know and from the way my family has made it out my mom has told him and he knows I'm his child but he was threatened when I was younger to never show his face and so on.", "This. You said what I meant, but better.", "This!", "They were 17 and apparently he was a drug addiction at a young age and they were just a fling. That's why she told him he wasn't allowed near me as a child. But that was 24 almost 25 years ago whose to say he's not clean now etc.", "Ending the relationship with your mother is probably a good thing. She is completely selfish and has no regard for your feelings, let alone your health and genetics. \n\nIt\u2019s important to know who your father is because he may have certain conditions or characteristics that are important for you to know, especially if you plan to have your own children. \n\nAnd obviously, it\u2019s very important for your emotional well-being to know who your father is and perhaps establish a relationship with him.", "Totally understandable. Think a lot of people feel the same way. Just realize that there could be some stuff that arises from it. For example, was the other guy also married? Or a priest (have a friend who's dad was a priest)?  Or it could be cool, interesting stuff. Or, probably, just mundane people stuff. But once you know you can't unknow.", ">she is morally obligated to tell the man who his dad is.\n\nSupposing she knows for sure, Why?", "Then she should have given op, who is an adult, the information they needed to draw that conclusion. \n\nThey have a right to make their own decisions, and decisions are best made with as much information as possible.", "I don\u2019t think your mother is necessarily TA. She is for not saying the truth, but maybe she is embarrassed, wanted to set a good example to you, or maybe it didn\u2019t happen under the best circumstances? Personally, my strategy is to just say the truth there is nothing to be ashamed of, so why lie? Lies and being untrustworthy are why you and her have a bad relationship. If you feel that would ruin things maybe you could soften it by saying want to do your ancestry instead of DNA?", "If the relationship is only stable if you do exactly as she says, it wasn\u2019t going to last anyways. Remember - relationships take two people. What is she doing to make sure she has a good relationship with you? Giving you basic info on your father was a low bar to meet and even that, you\u2019ve had to drag out of her bit by bit", "You are taking responsibility for the entire relationship. She has responsibilities, too. I'm sorry you are worried and frightened. I 'm a-tell the-truth and-let-the-chips-fall type. \n\nOf course, you can explore on your own and not share with the family. Adults are also entitled to privacy.", "Are you seeing a therapist individually? Or are you seeing one with your mom?", "Good luck, OP!", "I mean, it seems like your mom made the right decision to not have him in your life if he was a drug addict. \n\nOnce again, you have to decide if this is worth losing your relationship with your family.", "Thank you and I have had to reach out to her regarding medical stuff for my children that is when she claimed she knew it and still wouldn't allow me to even try to contact him. It means a lot to have more peoples opinions.", "After my mom admitted that I was adopted by my now father, the only response as to why she won't tell me who he is, is that she doesn't feel he is a good person for me or wasn't when they were younger and felt it best that I don't know or ever know who he is.", "His emotional well-being, for one. He did not ask to be born . He has the right to a relationship with his father if the father wants it. \n\n\nAlso, for health reasons. The father may have certain genetic traits or things of that nature, which could impact the OP or any future children. I\u2019m shocked that I have to explain this to you.", "Also entirely possible that OP was conceived as the result of a sexual assault.\n\nI've met a few people who went digging for their bio parents and found out, well, exactly that. If you're going to be looking, you have to accept that you might find something really terrible.", "Sorry that it's hard for you. Clearly not knowing is difficult and painful. I imagine that the subject is also painful for your mom.  I empathize with both views.", "Just a warning that when I have heard women say this it often means their child was conceived through rape or incest. I believe it's your right to know but please prepare yourself to have support.", "There's no reason to be snide about it. We can disagree and be okay with that.", "I\u2019m not being snide. I\u2019m honestly shocked that you cannot understand why someone would be obligated to disclose to the child who their father is.\n\nBut now that I have made my argument; why do you feel she is not obligated?", "Partly because of my own circumstances I put less emphasis on generics than I do nurture.  OPs mom really wanted OPs dad to be their dad, not the bio dad. Sounds like he was say least in the picture and a loving parent.  So if the bio dad was a bad guy or child somehow hurt OP emotionally, I could see why she might want to protect him. She might also be protecting herself for any number of reasons, good or bad.\n\n That said, I doempathize with OPs position as well", "At the very least, the mom would\u2019ve had the responsibility to share that information with the OP. Even then, he\u2019s an adult and able to make his own decisions. Even if bio dad was a bad guy, mom does not have the right to deny her adult child the knowledge of who his father is. \n\nShe is the jerk who chose to procreate with him, creating a shitty situation for the OP in the first place.", "I understand the sentiment but there's a reason that adopted kids or ones who were conceived via sperm donation aren't always legally able to find their biological parents.  So is there a difference is OP was conceived via medical artificial insemination versus a family friend?", "I never heard of a situation where an adopted/sperm donor child is legally barred from find their biological parents upon reaching adulthood. \n\nIf you know of a jurisdiction where this is the case, please share along with any relevant links to support your claim.", "op=NTA\n\nyou are entitled to know your truth.\n\nHowever, you may need to calibrate your expectations.   That she was so Unwilling to tell you anything could mean she was abandoned, SA'd, domestically abused, etc  \n\nI hope you find answers and that they add to your life, but be prepared for anything.", "NTA.  You are an adult.  I have a couple friends who did this and met family they didn\u2019t know and it went well.  Just be prepared if it doesn\u2019t.  One has found her bio dad to be an ass.  But his siblings and their families are great.", "NTA you\u2019re an adult and this is your life.", "In 99% of cases I agree. And not saying it's the case here, but what about someone who was conceived via rape? What if the mother didn't actually know the identity of the father to even share it and so saw no reason to burden her trauma onto the child? Do you think such a person \"deserves\" a relationship with their father?\n\nPerhaps they still have a right to know as adults, but as a child, it's hard to find an age appropriate way to explain which isn't going to negatively screw with their sense of identity. Even as an adult it wouldn't be an easy thing to process.\n\nNot to mention that it would be difficult for the mother to relive the trauma by telling the story, which she may or may not be emotionally equipped to deal with. He still has a right to get a DNA test of course to try to find out himself.", "Why do you need to keep your mother in the loop? It's your DNA you're testing and she hasn't been forthcoming. Tit for tat after all.\n\nThis is something they should have told you up front years ago, but your mother only now fessed to the prospects of you not being your step dads child.\n\nNTA", "NTA take the DNA test and strongly suggest you get one that can give you health information.", "Obviously NTA. Do what you want. \nLies always come out, especially big fat obvious poorly-concealed ones like this. There are ramifications.", "NAH - but if you decide to go through with this, just be ready to get answers that you won\u2019t like.  There could be a very good reason why your mother has tried to keep you as far away from this person as possible.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult.\n\nI'd be a bit more concerned about the social security issue.", "She's kept this from you your whole life. I don't understand why you have a dilemma about not telling her you are finding out the truth."]}
