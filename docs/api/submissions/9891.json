I don't know if I'm allowed to post here.  I'm 14 and I babysit for a few people in my neighborhood.  \n\nOn Friday I was babysitting for a couple that moved into the city from the south.

At quarter to ten I started texting them to see if they were on the way.  Then I called my parents.   My mom came over because I was getting worried.  It had snowed pretty bad on Friday and they weren't answering.   At 11:30 we phoned the police.   I was freaking out.  \n\nThe police got their names and address and I guess found their license plates like that.   They found them in about twenty five minutes.  They were at their friend's house.  They called me and they were mad that I called the police.  \n\nI promise I wouldn't have called the police if they had answered my texts or calls.   And my mom was concerned as well.  I didn't call to get them in trouble.  I was worried.

You\u2019re a literal child. \n2. They gave you an undertaking, and failed to keep it or inform you.\n3. You attempted to contact them first.\n4. You sought advice from an adult (your mum).\n5.

You said they moved to your city from the south.  I assume you mean a state that doesn't get a lot of snow?  I live in Canada and when it snows here people who have lived here their entire lives forget how to drive.  They could have been in an accident.  \n\n2. They were jerks for not giving you the phone number of the place they were going to be.   Cell phones run out of power and get left in purses. They should have given you contact information.  \n\n3.  You got advice from your mom.  You didn't do this without thinking bit through, or out of spite.  You had legitimate concerns and they were enough for your mom to agree that calling the police was a good idea.  \n\nYou did the exact right thing.  They are upset because a fourteen year old girl was more responsible than they were.", "NTA. If they can't stick to a return time or communicate with you for 2.5 hours afterwards, despite your calls and texts, they are not mature enough to hire a babysitter.\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing. The chance that they were in trouble was small but nonzero, and it's better to be safe than sorry. You handled this with a lot of maturity. They're just assholes.", "NTA! Over two and a half hours late, with a fourteen year old in charge - most kids your age have a curfew before 11:30 pm, so I don't know what they were thinking! I would have called the police, too, honestly.", "NTA. They told you they would be home by 9:00. By 10:00 you SHOULD be worried! And you waited at least an hour longer than I would have to call the police.  \n\nYou are not \u201cimmature \u201c, these people are jerks for not getting home about when they said they would. Let all your babysitting friends about these people so they do not also go through this. \n\nGlad your mother was there to support you.", "NTA. You did everything right.\nThese parents were very irresponsible not answering phone calls from the person who was looking after their children. They should be ashamed.", "NTA.\n\nThe parents were irresponsible and took advantage of your services. WHen they did not respond to your texts and over 2 hours past their stated time of return, you had no reason to not call the Police.\n\nParents like this take advantage of younger babysitters and then act like they are not responsible for the fact they were unreachable for their children for a significant period.\n\nThese are not your children.

You asked for help and you Got worried and handled the situation very Well. You should be proud of yourself. \n\nThe people you are babysitning for is immature irresponsible for letting you get worried. They were more than 1.5 hours late and radiosilent. At 14 years old you should not have to babysit for that late hour with no contact what-so-ever. \n\nDont let this episode get to you. You did the right thing and took responsivility. You should be proud of yourself for that.", "NTA. You were incredibly mature about how you handled this, and the parents are probably embarrassed by their bad behavior.\n\nRunning minutes late is expected. Running an hour late is annoying but it happens. Running two and a half hours late WITHOUT ANY NOTICE is something that should only happen when there is an emergency. And if there was an emergency involved then calling the police was exactly the right thing to do.", "NTA. I\u2019m a parent and I think the way you handled this was incredibly mature and responsible. The only immature people in this situation were the parents who stayed out longer than they said they would, failed to properly notify the person in charge of their childcare that they would be _hours_ late, ignored your calls/texts, and then lashed out at you rather than taking responsibility for their long list of poor choices. \n\nShould this or a similar situation ever arise again when you\u2019re babysitting, take the exact same steps you did this time. Try to reach the parents, find another trusted adult to help, then if all else fails, contact the proper authorities.", "NTA and you did the right series of things.  You called the, then you called your parents, then you called/texted them again, and finally when no one answered, it was reasonable to call the police and see if there was a bigger challenge.  Bottom line, they were in the wrong for not responding to the texts and calls.  They are losing out on a great resource as you are doing it the right way.", "NTA- they were taking advantage of you by staying out later than agreed and refusing to answer your calls/texts.", "NTA. They abandoned their kids with you.", "NTA you did everything right. It's also possible that something could have happened to them that would make it necessary for the police to take control of the care of the children. Since they wouldn't answer you at all it was perfectly reasonable to call the police. I think you handled this much better than most people your age would.", "Nta. If i were you, i wouldn't babysit for them anymore and tell all your friends to do the same. They will do this again and again with no remorse. And based on their reaction, they probably wont pay for the extra hour you were there for.", "NTA. They only got mad at you bc they got publicly humiliated for being bad parents. Also, calling the police on them was the proper thing to do bc you had no idea what may have happened to them", "NTA. As a mother, if someone is watching my kid I make sure I have my phone near me so I can be reached in emergencies. Furthermore, they should have told you if they were going to be late. How hard is it to text or call you? Oh yeah, it\u2019s not. They sound like shitty parents to me.", "NTA the parents should have answered their phones or let you know what was happening. Over 2 hrs late because they were hanging out at a friends house?! You did the right thing as I personally don\u2019t think a 14 year old should be babysitting that late at night and who knows what time they would have gotten home. From this post I don\u2019t think you\u2019re immature but the parents are and they owe you an apology.", "NTA.  At 14 years old, you are more mature than these \u2018parents\u2018 will ever be.  You were absolutely right in your actions and you should be very proud of yourself.  The fact that these \u2018parents\u2019 would not reply to your texts is irresponsible.

They had to business being that late if it wasn't due to an emergency. That would be bad to do to an adult, but especially bad for a younger teen. They are 100% wrong. You did this all correctly, between calling your parents, getting advise, then you both deciding to call the police and check on them.\n\nGood for you and drop them as clients.", "NTA. You did exactly what you should've done.\n\nIf they can't be bothered to be home on time and/or answer their phones then it's totally on them when the police show up to see if they're dead or alive.\n\nYou have no reason to feel bad here.  They, on the other hand, owe you an apology for putting you in such a stressful situation.", "NTA. They were over 2 hours late and not responding to multiple contact attempts by their babysitter.  There was a very real possibility they were in an accident. You did the right thing. Never babysitter for them again and warn your friends about them. They are not reliable employers.", " NTA. They said they\u2019d be home by 9 and by 11.30 you haven\u2019t heard anything and they don\u2019t respond to you they were being way out of line.", "NTA \n\nThat's abandonment. You did exactly the right thing. Good job looking out for those kids.", "NTA\n\nYou handled this perfectly. You should not care at all what these people said to you as they have proven themselves to be untrustworthy and irresponsible.", "NTA, you absolutely made the right call! Not your fault these two \u201cadults\u201d can\u2019t communicate. They also don\u2019t seem to have any respect for your time, either.", "NTA\n\nThey are majorly in the wrong here. They left a 14 year old babysitting their kid(s) and ignored calls/texts, staying out late without so much as updating or checking in. They just assumed you would dutifully wait there until whenever they felt pleased to return.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. They were two and a half hours late, they weren't answering their phone, road conditions may have been dicey. They had a responsibility to both you and their children to keep you apprised of changes to their plans - and staying out 2 1/2 hours past the time they said they would be in was a change of plans.", "NTA. That\u2019s so not cool of the parents.", "They absolutely should have answered the phone.\n\nAnd they're not mature enough to treat a babysitter properly. You're much better off not having them as clients.\n\nNTA. They're embarassed and they should be.", "NTA.  There is no excuse for a parent to ever not respond to contact from someone caring for their children.  It is an act of child abandonment as soon as they consciously refuse to communicate. They've abandoned their children and abdicated their responsibility because they were violating their agreement with you, deciding to require you to stay way later. If the pilice hadn't been involved, they would have been out to at least 1 am. They have no respect for you. Do not work for them again and spread the word to your fellow babysitters. \n\nThis seems to be a running theme. Can you find a babysitter contract template that you can modify and have your clients sign?  The first point is that the parents are always reachable and have a minimum reply time to texts and voice mail.  With the understanding that if they are unreachable, you will consider it an emergency situation and act accordingly.", "NTA - It sounds like this is the first time you're babysitting for them and I feel like any responsible parent would at least have the slightest bit of concern about their child being in the care of a stranger, someone who they couldn't possibly know for a fact was totally qualified for the job, at least to the extent of **checking their damn phone every 15 or so minutes** no matter how good of a time they were having. You had every right to call the police.", " NTA. They extended their time away by 2.5 hours and gave you no update as to when they would be home. I can pretty much guarantee that they knew you were trying to get ahold of them, they were ignoring you because talking to you would mean they would either have to come back at the appointed time, or negotiate for more pay.\n\nYou did the mature thing by calling the police when the LEGAL GUARDIANS of these kids failed to show up or make contact. They were absolutely trying to take advantage of you, being as young as you are. THEY were the immature ones in the scenario. The mindset of \u201cif I don\u2019t answer the phone and hear \u2018no\u2019 then the default answer is \u2018yes\u2019\u201d is the sort of crap that got my sister in massive trouble when she was your age, would stay out 5 hours past her curfew and not answer her phone, and get the cops called on her.\n\nIf there\u2019s any kind of babysitting network in your area on social media, put these parents on blast. Most likely you aren\u2019t the first hapless teenager they\u2019ve done this to, and you likely won\u2019t be the last.\n\nSo again, NTA, you did the right thing. This is the sort of entitled nonsense you would find on r/entitledparents", "Nta. They said theyd be home 2 hours earlier. Anything could of happened.\nAs a parent this horrifies me given what happens.if something happened to the baby?", "NTA. You did the responsible thing. The parents shouldn't have ignored your calls. What if one of the kids got hurt? The only irresponsible ones are the parents. This probably isn't the first time someone has called the police on them and if they continue to act like this it won't be the last.", "NTA at all\nI update my babysitter in an advanced degree program at college what time were going to be home, even if we are \"on time\". It's the only courteous thing to do.", "NTA\n\nHonestly if that is how these ADULTS are acting it's better that you don't work for them.   \n\n1. They should have come home when they said they would\n2. When it got close to 9 and they were still at their friends they should have called you\n3. When YOU called & texted they should have responded.\n4. They had an hour and a half to contact you.\n\nYou did the right thing calling your Mom.  14 is still young and you shouldn't be working at any job late in the evening.  Even if you were 18 - you'd still have every reason to be concerned when parents don't show up or answer their phones. You said it had snowed a lot - people get themselves in all sorts of bad situations during bad weather; they could have been in an accident, or snowed in on some side street at which point having the cops out looking for them would have been a blessing. \n\nIt's an awkward situation but they are the adults and had ample time to avoid the police interaction.  Be glad you don't have to work for them anymore - they are unreliable, and do not respect your time.", "NTA. They were not back when they said they would be and you couldn't contact them. You didn't call the police at 9:01, you tried multiple times to contact them and they didn't answer. Sounds very reasonable", ">they told my mom that I'm not mature enough to be babysitting if that's how I'm going to behave.\n\nCalling the police after over 2 hours of noncommunication is EXACTLY the right response. Like, worst case scenario-- what if they'd gotten in an accident on the way home and that's why they weren't capable of answering the phones? My first thought would not be 'they're too uninterested in their own children's wellbeing to bother communicating with their babysitter for hours on end'.  \n\n\nI would argue that they are not mature enough to reproduce if that is how they are going to behave.", "NTA, OP. Once I called the paramedics on my roommate because she *failed to mention she was a sleepwalker\u2026* we aren\u2019t mind readers!\n\nIf anything, they\u2019re the immature ones to not stick to a time window and ignore you after that time has passed. I can only imagine the activities and their mindsets to just think it was fine to ignore you.

If they didn't want you to have that reaction, they should have responded to you.  One text from them would have avoided all of this.", "NTA one time as a young adult I was babysitting a family I\u2019d never met before (I worked for an agency). The mom was working a job 90 minutes away said she\u2019d be home by 9, wasn\u2019t. I called and texted repeatedly she came back after midnight no apology whatsoever just that someone had called out so she had to work late. Like she couldn\u2019t have texted me on her way home\nI was 100% convinced she\u2019d been in a car accident. The agency said we should call the police if the parents were unresponsive and I didn\u2019t because I was afraid she\u2019d get into trouble or id be bothering the police.

Submit a request for the record from the police department. If anyone asks, you can show them the call log and it\u2019ll prove you were in the right.

That will solve their babysitting issues because they will never be able to hire a babysitter again.  Then hang up, walk away, shut the door in their face - you don't owe them another word!  If they aren't going to apologize to you then do just that.  Tell all your friends and then refuse to babysit again.\n\nBack in the 1970's, I babysat for a couple that did the exact same thing.  They said they would be home at 11pm and I was still there at 2am.  This was before cell phones.  I knew the restaurant they had gone to closed at 11pm so I had no idea where they went and no places I could call to find them, so I had to wait.  I was 13 and furious when they got home.  The dad drove me home and was met in the driveway by my father.  Dad got up to get ready for work at 2:30am.  He was raging when he saw I wasn't home.  I didn't have to say anything - he said it all for me. My father sent me inside but I got to hear all of it from the entryway.  After the other dad left, my dad told me to do exactly what I told you - and I did.  I refused to babysit again for them and told all my friends.  That couple couldn't find a sitter to save their lives after that.  The mom constantly called and begged my mom to get me to reconsider but I refused.  \n\nDon't ever babysit again for them unless they apologize to you and your mom.  You can bet that if they refuse to apologize for their behavior, then it will be repeated again and again.

Not enough to be parents, and not enough to respect others time, don't sit for them anymore.", "So parents being negligible are saying you're not good for babysitting if you behave like this.\n\nI think you behaved more maturely than than them.

Before cell phones, my parents would leave our sitters the phone number for the restaurant or movie theater or wherever they were going, even when our sitters were adults who could drive to the ER or wherever in an emergency.\n\nThey were not only an hour and a half late, but an hour and a half late without answering calls or texts. It was very reasonable of you to be worried. What you did was absolutely the mature thing-- trying to protect yourself and their kids and make sure adults knew what was going on and that the kids' parents were safe and were going to come home. Also, they were taking advantage of you, and they BETTER have paid you for all that time.\n\nETA: Also, even if you *had* been somewhat overcautious-- that is a *good* trait in a babysitter.

I'm not so sure they're mature enough to be parents if they decided to stay out an extra 4+ hours without alerting the person being paid to ensure their children's safety.

You did the right thing. I have a feeling they saw you as a young person they could bully & take advantage of. Who knows when they would have gotten home if you hadn\u2019t called the police?", "You did the right thing, what if the kids were sick or some other emergency? They purposefully ignored you and also went way over the agreed time. Not like 10min, stuck in traffic, but hours. \n\nNTA and don't doubt your actions, they're not great people and trying to take advantage.

Hopefully you can take this as a lesson and in the future draw boundaries about what you expect/require as a babysitter and STICK TO IT! Don\u2019t let ANYONE get away with disrespecting you either.

Your point is valid\u2014 what if their kids needed help. \n\nThese people were trying to take advantage of you.", "NTA they were 100% trying to take advantage.

As a parent you need to be phone ready.", "You were the mature one in this scenario, and were NTA. They were. They had still not even started home hours after the agreed upon time. They did not do you the courtesy of calling you to ask if you could stay later. They did not take the calls of the person babysitting their children.

It\u2019s laughable that people who would leave their small children hours late with a babysitter would say you lacked maturity. \n\nSeriously. Laugh your butt off every time you think of these idiots calling you immature. \n\nOne day, you might be a mother and look back on this and shake your head at those people. \n\nSounds like you\u2019re a great babysitter. If I were hours late, and didn\u2019t take a babysitter\u2019s call, then it would be because I was stuck in a snowstorm, in a car accident, kidnapped, or dead.

Trash them to all of your babysitter friends. \n\n2. Parents need you a lot more than you need them.  It's a sellers Markey and you have the power  \n\n3. Treat yourself like an independent contractor. Set rates including fees for being late. Badmouth them to your fellow sitters if they refuse to pay.\n\n4.

The parents were supposed to be home at 1:00 a.m.\n\nInstead, they got back at 5:30 a.m.  .... drunk.\n\nEven though they payed for the extra hours, I never worked for them again.  You shouldn't either.  BTW, NTA, OP.", "I had the exact same thing happen to me at 14. It was awful and I refused to ever babysit for them again after that.", "NTA, I work in childcare. It is policy to call the police if we are not able to get in contact with parents/guardians that haven\u2019t picked up their child by 30 minutes past the expected pick up time. What you did is exactly what any good child care provider would do when parent/guardians are awol: call a supervisor and then the police.", "NTA. You did an amazing job handling what sounds like a really stressful situation! And I hope your mom tore them up for putting you in that position.

First, you tried to contact the parents. That is always the first step. Then, you brought a trusted adult (your mom) into the situation. That was the correct next step. Then you and said trusted adult TOGETHER decided it was time to call the police, which at that time I think was the correct next step, if the parents still were not answering. \nI feel bad for the kids if their parents don\u2019t care enough about them to check in with the sitter when they are an hour and a half late coming home. Most parents would be checking in to make sure everything was ok long before that, and decent human beings notify the sitter if an actual emergency comes up (like, they are stranded on the side of the road or their locks are frozen.) and decent human beings would not keep a sitter, especially an underage sitter, longer than the agreed upon time without checking in first and making sure it\u2019s ok.\nI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with such people. Unfortunately, you will meet more and more of them as you become more and more independent and less protected.", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing, OP. You handled this with more maturity than I would have when I was your age.", "NTA...and they are completely AHs.  They probably aren't mature enough to have children.", "NTA I started babysitting a little younger than you, and that is exactly the right call. If anyone is the A, it\u2019s the people who failed to communicate about the change from what they SAID about their timing. \nEspecially with the dangerous conditions with the snow on the ground. If they had gotten hurt somewhere where they wouldn\u2019t be found quickly enough, they could easily have died. Even if they weren\u2019t injured to that point, the weather presents a major threat to them. You were (at least as far as you know) the only person who knew they weren\u2019t where they said they\u2019d be, and it was the right call to get your mother and then get the authorities involved.", "NTA and immaturity is something they\u2019ve got a lot of nerve saying. Mature parents answer their texts and come home on time.", "NTA You and your mom are the ones that acted in a mature fashion. They didn't answer your attempts to contact them, despite being late.\n\nTo put it another way, you had a verbal contract that they would be home by 9pm. They failed to uphold their end of the contract. By 2 and half hours. And then only because a third party forced them to return.", "NTA.\n\nWhat sticks out to me most is \"But they told my mom that I'm not mature enough to be babysitting if that's how I'm going to behave.\"\n\nHonestly, if they truly believed that, then they're AHs for letting someone look after their kid who they think is not mature enough to do so.", "NTA. They're not mature enough to know how to have a babysitter.", "NTA. I\u2019m a mom of two young kids and our favorite sitter is around your age. I always set expectations, message our eta of it was not a set one but rather a range (eg 10-11), and then heads ups when we are on the way back. I also check my phone to make sure she does not need anything or if we should come home to let her go home and rest. \n\nTo be fair I do it regardless of a sitter\u2019s age. \n\nNTA. Good luck with your babysitting business", "NTA- next time call child protection and report them for abandoning their kids.

Some people in this world think they are owed the most unreasonable of favours!", "NTA at all", "NTA. And OP, don't feel bad. Let me tell you a secret about maturity, something that takes many adults--myself included--took a long time to figure out: being a \"mature\" adult is not about handling everything on your own; it is about knowing your limits and when you need to reach out to others. You did the mature, adult thing by acknowledging you needed help and reaching out for it. Good for you.\n\nAnd if what they say gets to you, remind yourself: you didn't jet off to a friend's house and refuse to come home while ignoring all calls and texts from the person watching your kid. That's immature, not what you did.", "NTA you were very mature in calling you mum when there was an issue.\n\nThey thought they could get away with it because you were 14.

Had something happened to them, a swift emergency response would have been crucial.", "NTA. You did everything right OP. The parents were wrong in many different ways: they lied to you what time they would come home, they didn't answer any or your messages, even if they accidentally stayd out later they should have communicated that with you.

They are the assholes, you are not.", "u/RichAd1994 Unfortunately, there are many people who think their time is more important than everyone else's, and they expect you to play along. The parents lied to you and broke their agreement. You did the right thing by having the police do a welfare check. Maybe the embarrassment will make them think twice about pulling this stunt again. In the meantime, make sure you are compensated for the overtime, and consider charging a penalty for late parents if you decide to babysit more after this. NTA", "NTA. They sound horrible imo. They should\u2019ve been respectful of your time. Even if they are only a block away and you are a very young teen girl and they should have been respectful of that, not if your maturity but just in case someone tried to break in and harm you for that very reason.

Babysitting briefly is one thing but they are two adults who weren't responsible enough to keep an eye on the time, respond back to the babysitter and think it's ok to basically ditch the kids and leave a 14yo stuck at their home waiting for whenever they want to turn up.\n\nIt would be one thing if you were 18, but you aren't. You are too young to drive, it was snowing, it's closing in on midnight and it's not like they were headed back. Would that mean they decide to turn up 12:30am and a 14 has to walk back home in the snow? On their own? Middle of the night.\n\nThat would be negligent of your parents to let you walk those blocks alone so late at night. So then what happens to your parent, they stay awake until they are done socialising and turn up whenever they can be bothered?

You were operating under the assumption they may have been incapacitated and unable to answer because there is no way any REASONABLE parent wouldnt answer the phone for the babysitter! \n\nBut refuse to babysit for them ever again and dont be afraid to share what they did, cause its COMPLETELY inappropriate on their part. They will try to take advantage of every babysitter they get.", "NTA the people are clearly the ones who are not responsible and that's exactly what you should have done best case they where safe and just being bad parents ( and yes they are bad parents ) worse case they could have been in a lot of trouble or hurt and you could have saved there life by calling the police you did the right thing", "NTA. Well done OP", "You and the parents wanting you as a baby-sitter made an agreement: you would responsibly take care of their kids, and they would pay you and be home when they say.

If they had been in an accident and couldn't answer the phone, they would have been royally fucked if you just left it and didn't call the police. They sound irresponsible and manipulative.", "Not only are you NTA, you're also very resourceful \nand level-headed for working through your options in order of significance (e.g. you didn't just panic and jump straight to ringing the police).", "NTA - You did the right thing. Parents wanted to be unbothered all night. I would have done the same and I'm an adult. Way to go kid! Responsible behaviour and right call on your mom too.", "NTA. At 14 you are a more mature person than the grown adults. Well done on your responsible behaviour!", "NTA", "NTA I have my 14 year old brother occasionally babysit for me in the mornings (he stays the night since I start work at 4am and am home usually around 7am). One morning recently I got a \u201cwhere ARE you?\u201d phone call from him. Well I had been held up at work and it was now 7:20 and after a full 3 weeks of me being home by 6:45. \n\nIf I hadn\u2019t answered I can guarantee the next call would have been to our parents and if they couldn\u2019t my reach me either one of them would have gone for a drive to try and find me or called the cops (cops would have been further down the list since we\u2019re in a rural area and the cops are usually about an hour away)", "NTA. If they can't be home even two and a half hours after they said they would be, they're not mature enough to be parents, and yet here we are.", "You absolutely did the right thing, OP. \n\nEven when I babysit my grandchildren, that's my one rule for my kids - if I have your child, you better answer your phone. \n\nNTA", "NTA... You did everything right and nothing wrong. They got caught taking adbantage of a 14yr old. I hope you charged them extra for having to stay over and work longer.", "NTA, OP. You did the right thing.", "I hope all baby sitters take the actions you did. I wish I handled it the same way when I was younger. My half brother pulled this shit and I never baby sat for him again. The next day driving to work I almost died on the freeway due to lack of sleep. I would never have agreed to me getting home at 1am when it was meant to be heading home at 8pm.\n\nIt's not just that the agreement was broken but a complete lack of respect for you in so many ways. It's the parents who aren't mature enough to have a baby sitter.\n\nEdit: NTA\n\nBaby sitting is a business agreement between 2 parties. When the parents are late they should be charged overtime. An agreement was made and they have failed on their end. You did not fail on your end. I would make it very clear next time you baby sit anyone that every 15min block outside the arranged time frame will be charged at your hourly rate. Eg if you make $20 per hr then it's $20 per 15mins for overtime. With rounding to make it clearer, 7mins round down, 8mins round up. If there's an emergency with one of your regulars you can always say I'm not going to charge this time. But it's harder to say you owe me overtime when there's no precedent in place.", "NTA! You're 14. You shouldn't be out that late.  Wth is wrong with them.", "NTA. When I was around your age, I used to babysit in my neighborhood too. I remember something similar happened to me and I had to call the police because the woman I was babysitting for was several hours late. She was supposed to be home around 11:00 and it was around 3:00 the following morning. \n\nAfter that harrowing incident she also refused to pay me. I knocked on her door every day until she finally gave me the money I earned. \n\nThey accuse you of not being mature enough to babysit. How rich! What if you were trying to get in touch with them because there was an emergency with their child? It's their responsibility to contact you and let you know if they're going to be late, and they should have answered their damned phone! Hardly the pinnacle of maturity themselves, I'd say. \n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't babysit for them ever again. They sound completely irresponsible.", "This is pretty cut and dry. NTA. If they were late by like 10 minutes and you called the police first before even bothering to call them, yeah, that's on you. But almost two hours! And they were just at a friend's house. Not an accident. Not snowed in. Just at a friend's house. Plus you're 14, so fuck them so much. You did everything right in This situation. As far as I'm concerned, you're absolutely mature enough for this job. Fuck them. Don't babysit them again.", "Well done, NTA. Great mature response, a lot more mature than them. They are probably just embarrassed that you acted more adult than them. Good work p.", "NTA. They are bad clients/employers, do not work for them ever again as this is unacceptable behavior from parents using a babysitter.", "NTA", "NTA.", "You did the right thing.  You are NTA!  \n\nGood parents would have returned on time.  They would have notified you that they would return home later than they told you.  Good parents would have answered your texts immediately for fear that something had happened and they were needed at home. \n\nYou handled the situation well.  Parents who hire you are lucky to have such a responsible sitter with their children!", "Oh you sweet child. You did absolutely NOTHING wrong. Literally nothing. NTA. You did the right thing. You're a minor yourself and they ghosted you with their children and didn't come gome when they were supposed to. I don't understand how people leave their kids with a sitter and think it's OK to go totally dark and/not show up!\n\nDon't let this bother you any more than it already has. You were being a responsible person concerned for the well being of others. It sounds like your parents are raising you right.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. They were irresponsible to neglect your calls. You are too mature to babysit for these childish adult.", "Absolutely NTA. You didn\u2019t sign up for an all night babysitting gig and that wouldn\u2019t even be appropriate at your age! You did the responsible thing by calling your mom AND the police! Shame on them.", "NTA  They lied to a 14 year old, refused to answer their phones and now they're just trying to make you feel bad for their bad actions.  You handled it very maturely.  In the future, only babysit for people you know and discuss the issue of them not getting back on time.  You could have a policy - e.g. they have a 30 minute grace period and then you will be calling the police if you haven't heard from them.   I hope you got paid.", "They didn't answer their phone and, in your words, it had snowed pretty badly that day. Aside from any emergency on *your* end involving the kids, what if they had been stranded somewhere due to bad weather conditions and couldn't communicate with you? You can't be faulted for calling the police. Had they answered your call or had the courtesy to ask if you could stay later since they stopped to visit friends, there would have been no need for the police to be summoned. NTA.", "Ask your mom \u2018what\u2019s the acceptable amount of time to wait to call for help? 4 hours? 6? 8?\u2019 You did the right thing", "Info- How would the police find them at their friends house, not knowing who the friends are, and in the dark in a snowstorm?", "14? You shouldn't be on Reddit, too much degenerate shit for a kid, go enjoy your youth you dumb shit!", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong, they were rude and so wrong. They should apologise to you and pay for the extra time you spent there plus some more.", "NTA. You are a responsible babysitter. They are irresponsible for ignoring your messages.", "NTA, don\u2019t babysit for them anymore. They owe you over time by the way. And I\u2019m glad your mum was with you. \n\nIt\u2019s a good life lesson learned for you imo, that there are such irresponsible people in the world and to have a backup plan if something goes wrong. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to feel sorry to the parents, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. You did absolutely the right thing. Don't feel bad, be mad! They did not abide by their agreement with you and left you, a child, alone caring for their kids. They are the immature ones!", "NTA - Tell them they aren't mature enough to go out if they can't answer the person who is caring for their child at the moment.", "NTA- they are not mature enough to have kids if that is how they are going to behave", "You were the responsible person there and it was the responsible thing to do. NTA.", "They're not mature enough to be parents if that's how they're going to behave. You did everything right. Well done you!", "Normally parents always answer their phones when the babysitter calls.  You were right to be worried when they didn't.  NTA and well done for handling this situation so well.\n\nHonestly I think the reason they called you immature etc is that they were getting embarrassed by how irresponsible they had been, so they tried to deflect it onto you.", "NTA\nThey seem to be not mature enough to have  babysitter if they can't be on time.\n\nDon't get me wrong 5-15min late is easy to happen and not a BIG deal.\nBut not being available and 2.5 HOURS late is a big nono.\n\nPlease do not work there again, OP.", "NTA. You were being mistreated by the parents to start with. They were two and a half hours late to get their kids from you with no reply. Also, you're right to wonder what would've happened if their kids got hurt. When parents leave their kids, those kids or their caretaker absolutely need to be able to reach them. Besides, for all you knew, something bad had happened. Calling was the right thing to do.", "NTA. Parents who leave their kids with another person still need to be contactable in case of emergency, and they need to clearly communicate any changes to finish time.", "NTA. those parents leaving their kids with a 14 yo KID are the AH. 14 is fine for an hour or two in the afternoon or early evening but not to be out partying until midnight like they were young and carefree again.", "NTA. You handled this perfectly. Do not babysit for them again, and if you have friends who babysit, warn them about this couple.", "If I'm ever 2.5 hours late to pick my child up from a babysitter, when I'm out in potentially dangerous weather, with zero contact, I sincerely hope my babysitter would call the police because under those circumstances, something has gone terribly wrong.  \n\nIf this was a daycare or a school, they likely would have called the police as well, so it's not a decision that wouldn't be made by many adults in a similar situation. \n\nOne thing I started doing when I was a nanny was asking families to leave an emergency contact I could call in case I wasn't able to contact the parents.  Not only is it helpful information if there was an accident or a medical emergency, it's good for families to know you'll be calling gramma two towns over if they don't turn up or contact you.  \n\nEven if it's not someone local, it's good to have a family member or close friend available quickly if something serious were to happen. I actually have documents that show my parents are able to make emergency decisions or take immediate custody of my children in case my husband and I can't for some reason.  I've seen some situations get real messy, really fast, so I'm a little paranoid about such things.", "NTA. They weren\u2019t being responsible or mature enough to be parents, when they elected to stay out past the agreed time. They didn\u2019t answer their phones. What were they expecting? For all you knew, they were in an accident!", "NTA \nDo not feel badly,  they were taking advantage of you.", "NTA and what you did is exactly mature and what you should have as a parent myself if a baby sitter didn\u2019t do that I would honestly have red flags going off (not that I would actually do what those parents did because it is absolutely irresponsible) they are just pissed they got called out and told they are being irresponsible", "I think you are infinitely more mature than the so called adults. They did not come home when they said they would, and ignored your calls, and texts. \n\nYou are definitely NTA.", "NTA you handled this in a very appropriate way, they gave a return time, their was adverse weather conditions and they were nit answering thier phone.  You were right to call the police,  they were the ones being irresponsible.  Don't babysit for them again and give others a heads up of what they did.", "NTA. Excuse me? You're not mature enough? You handled this situation brilliantly. They are the ones that didn't  keep to their agreement. You set a very clear boundary, they agreed to it and then ignored it and you. They disrespected you by their behavior. Not the other way around. I would fire them as your babysitting clients.", "Two grown adults too with phones, and not one of them were able to respond. \n\nThe babysitter was the mature one here.

The 14yo turns out to be more mature than the parents!", "When my mom was a young teen she used to babysit every thursday at a friends-of-her-parents house.\nShe always left 10-20min before the parents would come home, most evenings she'll pass them on her walk, they comming from church choir, her going home. But some nights they would stay late at the church... (early 70s.
