I don't know if I'm allowed to post here.  I'm 14 and I babysit for a few people in my neighborhood.  \n\nOn Friday I was babysitting for a couple that moved into the city from the south.

At quarter to ten I started texting them to see if they were on the way.  Then I called my parents.   My mom came over because I was getting worried.  It had snowed pretty bad on Friday and they weren't answering.   At 11:30 we phoned the police.   I was freaking out.  \n\nThe police got their names and address and I guess found their license plates like that.   They found them in about twenty five minutes.  They were at their friend's house.  They called me and they were mad that I called the police.  \n\nI promise I wouldn't have called the police if they had answered my texts or calls.   And my mom was concerned as well.  I didn't call to get them in trouble.  I was worried.

If they were going to be late, they should have informed you and discussed options on what to do with the child\n3. You are 14, and did exactly the right thing\n4. your concern for them was valid\n\nThey should apologize to you and your family\n\nThey are probably butt hurt about feeling embarrassed infront of their friends for their utterly irresponsible behavior", "NTA.\n\n1. You\u2019re a literal child. \n2. They gave you an undertaking, and failed to keep it or inform you.\n3. You attempted to contact them first.\n4. You sought advice from an adult (your mum).\n5. They disrespected not only you but your parents who were comfortable allowing you out until 10, not nearly midnight.\n6. You had no option to just go home when they didn\u2019t show because you were still responsible for their children.\n\nThey\u2019re assholes and you should warn other baby sitters off them.", "NTA- they told you they would be home by 9 and were late by 2 hours. In business there is a term that is called a hard stop. That means you cannot stay past this time. If you decide to babysit again, tell the parents \u201cI have a hard stop at 11pm.\nIf you are late, I get paid twice my hourly rate.\u201d Trust me- most couples will be home on time. \n\nAlso- if a couple did this to me when I was babysitting- I would have fired them as clients.", "NTA.  \n\nThree things.  \n\n1. You said they moved to your city from the south.  I assume you mean a state that doesn't get a lot of snow?  I live in Canada and when it snows here people who have lived here their entire lives forget how to drive.  They could have been in an accident.  \n\n2. They were jerks for not giving you the phone number of the place they were going to be.   Cell phones run out of power and get left in purses. They should have given you contact information.  \n\n3.  You got advice from your mom.  You didn't do this without thinking bit through, or out of spite.  You had legitimate concerns and they were enough for your mom to agree that calling the police was a good idea.  \n\nYou did the exact right thing.  They are upset because a fourteen year old girl was more responsible than they were.", "NTA. If they can't stick to a return time or communicate with you for 2.5 hours afterwards, despite your calls and texts, they are not mature enough to hire a babysitter.\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing. The chance that they were in trouble was small but nonzero, and it's better to be safe than sorry. You handled this with a lot of maturity. They're just assholes.", "NTA! Over two and a half hours late, with a fourteen year old in charge - most kids your age have a curfew before 11:30 pm, so I don't know what they were thinking! I would have called the police, too, honestly.", "NTA. They told you they would be home by 9:00. By 10:00 you SHOULD be worried! And you waited at least an hour longer than I would have to call the police.  \n\nYou are not \u201cimmature \u201c, these people are jerks for not getting home about when they said they would. Let all your babysitting friends about these people so they do not also go through this. \n\nGlad your mother was there to support you.", "NTA. You did everything right.\nThese parents were very irresponsible not answering phone calls from the person who was looking after their children. They should be ashamed.", "NTA.\n\nThe parents were irresponsible and took advantage of your services. WHen they did not respond to your texts and over 2 hours past their stated time of return, you had no reason to not call the Police.\n\nParents like this take advantage of younger babysitters and then act like they are not responsible for the fact they were unreachable for their children for a significant period.\n\nThese are not your children. THey are theirs. THey should have been more responsible about communicating with you and negotiating new rates for the overtime. \n\nThey got scared when they realized the police could have taken the kids rather than find them so they're taking it out on you.", "NTA - you did the only possible thing you could do. You asked for help and you Got worried and handled the situation very Well. You should be proud of yourself. \n\nThe people you are babysitning for is immature irresponsible for letting you get worried. They were more than 1.5 hours late and radiosilent. At 14 years old you should not have to babysit for that late hour with no contact what-so-ever. \n\nDont let this episode get to you. You did the right thing and took responsivility. You should be proud of yourself for that.", "NTA. You were incredibly mature about how you handled this, and the parents are probably embarrassed by their bad behavior.\n\nRunning minutes late is expected. Running an hour late is annoying but it happens. Running two and a half hours late WITHOUT ANY NOTICE is something that should only happen when there is an emergency. And if there was an emergency involved then calling the police was exactly the right thing to do.", "NTA. I\u2019m a parent and I think the way you handled this was incredibly mature and responsible. The only immature people in this situation were the parents who stayed out longer than they said they would, failed to properly notify the person in charge of their childcare that they would be _hours_ late, ignored your calls/texts, and then lashed out at you rather than taking responsibility for their long list of poor choices. \n\nShould this or a similar situation ever arise again when you\u2019re babysitting, take the exact same steps you did this time. Try to reach the parents, find another trusted adult to help, then if all else fails, contact the proper authorities.", "NTA and you did the right series of things.  You called the, then you called your parents, then you called/texted them again, and finally when no one answered, it was reasonable to call the police and see if there was a bigger challenge.  Bottom line, they were in the wrong for not responding to the texts and calls.  They are losing out on a great resource as you are doing it the right way.", "NTA- they were taking advantage of you by staying out later than agreed and refusing to answer your calls/texts.", "NTA. They abandoned their kids with you.", "NTA you did everything right. It's also possible that something could have happened to them that would make it necessary for the police to take control of the care of the children. Since they wouldn't answer you at all it was perfectly reasonable to call the police. I think you handled this much better than most people your age would.", "Nta. If i were you, i wouldn't babysit for them anymore and tell all your friends to do the same. They will do this again and again with no remorse. And based on their reaction, they probably wont pay for the extra hour you were there for.", "NTA. They only got mad at you bc they got publicly humiliated for being bad parents. Also, calling the police on them was the proper thing to do bc you had no idea what may have happened to them", "NTA. As a mother, if someone is watching my kid I make sure I have my phone near me so I can be reached in emergencies. Furthermore, they should have told you if they were going to be late. How hard is it to text or call you? Oh yeah, it\u2019s not. They sound like shitty parents to me.", "NTA the parents should have answered their phones or let you know what was happening. Over 2 hrs late because they were hanging out at a friends house?! You did the right thing as I personally don\u2019t think a 14 year old should be babysitting that late at night and who knows what time they would have gotten home. From this post I don\u2019t think you\u2019re immature but the parents are and they owe you an apology.", "NTA.  At 14 years old, you are more mature than these \u2018parents\u2018 will ever be.  You were absolutely right in your actions and you should be very proud of yourself.  The fact that these \u2018parents\u2019 would not reply to your texts is irresponsible.  What if there was something wrong with their child or in their home?  Especially since it was snowing.  Well done!!  They\u2019re the AH!  You\u2019re the hero!! \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA. They had to business being that late if it wasn't due to an emergency. That would be bad to do to an adult, but especially bad for a younger teen. They are 100% wrong. You did this all correctly, between calling your parents, getting advise, then you both deciding to call the police and check on them.\n\nGood for you and drop them as clients.", "NTA. You did exactly what you should've done.\n\nIf they can't be bothered to be home on time and/or answer their phones then it's totally on them when the police show up to see if they're dead or alive.\n\nYou have no reason to feel bad here.  They, on the other hand, owe you an apology for putting you in such a stressful situation.", "NTA. They were over 2 hours late and not responding to multiple contact attempts by their babysitter.  There was a very real possibility they were in an accident. You did the right thing. Never babysitter for them again and warn your friends about them. They are not reliable employers.", " NTA. They said they\u2019d be home by 9 and by 11.30 you haven\u2019t heard anything and they don\u2019t respond to you they were being way out of line.", "NTA \n\nThat's abandonment. You did exactly the right thing. Good job looking out for those kids.", "NTA\n\nYou handled this perfectly. You should not care at all what these people said to you as they have proven themselves to be untrustworthy and irresponsible.", "NTA, you absolutely made the right call! Not your fault these two \u201cadults\u201d can\u2019t communicate. They also don\u2019t seem to have any respect for your time, either.", "NTA\n\nThey are majorly in the wrong here. They left a 14 year old babysitting their kid(s) and ignored calls/texts, staying out late without so much as updating or checking in. They just assumed you would dutifully wait there until whenever they felt pleased to return.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. They were two and a half hours late, they weren't answering their phone, road conditions may have been dicey. They had a responsibility to both you and their children to keep you apprised of changes to their plans - and staying out 2 1/2 hours past the time they said they would be in was a change of plans.", "NTA. That\u2019s so not cool of the parents.", "They absolutely should have answered the phone.\n\nAnd they're not mature enough to treat a babysitter properly. You're much better off not having them as clients.\n\nNTA. They're embarassed and they should be.", "NTA.  There is no excuse for a parent to ever not respond to contact from someone caring for their children.  It is an act of child abandonment as soon as they consciously refuse to communicate. They've abandoned their children and abdicated their responsibility because they were violating their agreement with you, deciding to require you to stay way later. If the pilice hadn't been involved, they would have been out to at least 1 am. They have no respect for you. Do not work for them again and spread the word to your fellow babysitters. \n\nThis seems to be a running theme. Can you find a babysitter contract template that you can modify and have your clients sign?  The first point is that the parents are always reachable and have a minimum reply time to texts and voice mail.  With the understanding that if they are unreachable, you will consider it an emergency situation and act accordingly.", "NTA - It sounds like this is the first time you're babysitting for them and I feel like any responsible parent would at least have the slightest bit of concern about their child being in the care of a stranger, someone who they couldn't possibly know for a fact was totally qualified for the job, at least to the extent of **checking their damn phone every 15 or so minutes** no matter how good of a time they were having. You had every right to call the police.", " NTA. They extended their time away by 2.5 hours and gave you no update as to when they would be home. I can pretty much guarantee that they knew you were trying to get ahold of them, they were ignoring you because talking to you would mean they would either have to come back at the appointed time, or negotiate for more pay.\n\nYou did the mature thing by calling the police when the LEGAL GUARDIANS of these kids failed to show up or make contact. They were absolutely trying to take advantage of you, being as young as you are. THEY were the immature ones in the scenario. The mindset of \u201cif I don\u2019t answer the phone and hear \u2018no\u2019 then the default answer is \u2018yes\u2019\u201d is the sort of crap that got my sister in massive trouble when she was your age, would stay out 5 hours past her curfew and not answer her phone, and get the cops called on her.\n\nIf there\u2019s any kind of babysitting network in your area on social media, put these parents on blast. Most likely you aren\u2019t the first hapless teenager they\u2019ve done this to, and you likely won\u2019t be the last.\n\nSo again, NTA, you did the right thing. This is the sort of entitled nonsense you would find on r/entitledparents", "Nta. They said theyd be home 2 hours earlier. Anything could of happened.\nAs a parent this horrifies me given what happens.if something happened to the baby?", "NTA. You did the responsible thing. The parents shouldn't have ignored your calls. What if one of the kids got hurt? The only irresponsible ones are the parents. This probably isn't the first time someone has called the police on them and if they continue to act like this it won't be the last.", "NTA at all\nI update my babysitter in an advanced degree program at college what time were going to be home, even if we are \"on time\". It's the only courteous thing to do.", "NTA\n\nHonestly if that is how these ADULTS are acting it's better that you don't work for them.   \n\n1. They should have come home when they said they would\n2. When it got close to 9 and they were still at their friends they should have called you\n3. When YOU called & texted they should have responded.\n4. They had an hour and a half to contact you.\n\nYou did the right thing calling your Mom.  14 is still young and you shouldn't be working at any job late in the evening.  Even if you were 18 - you'd still have every reason to be concerned when parents don't show up or answer their phones. You said it had snowed a lot - people get themselves in all sorts of bad situations during bad weather; they could have been in an accident, or snowed in on some side street at which point having the cops out looking for them would have been a blessing. \n\nIt's an awkward situation but they are the adults and had ample time to avoid the police interaction.  Be glad you don't have to work for them anymore - they are unreliable, and do not respect your time.", "NTA. They were not back when they said they would be and you couldn't contact them. You didn't call the police at 9:01, you tried multiple times to contact them and they didn't answer. Sounds very reasonable", ">they told my mom that I'm not mature enough to be babysitting if that's how I'm going to behave.\n\nCalling the police after over 2 hours of noncommunication is EXACTLY the right response. Like, worst case scenario-- what if they'd gotten in an accident on the way home and that's why they weren't capable of answering the phones? My first thought would not be 'they're too uninterested in their own children's wellbeing to bother communicating with their babysitter for hours on end'.  \n\n\nI would argue that they are not mature enough to reproduce if that is how they are going to behave.", "NTA, OP. Once I called the paramedics on my roommate because she *failed to mention she was a sleepwalker\u2026* we aren\u2019t mind readers!\n\nIf anything, they\u2019re the immature ones to not stick to a time window and ignore you after that time has passed. I can only imagine the activities and their mindsets to just think it was fine to ignore you. I think it\u2019s more than fine to fire them from requesting your services ever again, even if they backtrack, stand firm and say, \u201dno!\u201d", "NTA.  If they didn't want you to have that reaction, they should have responded to you.  One text from them would have avoided all of this.", "NTA one time as a young adult I was babysitting a family I\u2019d never met before (I worked for an agency). The mom was working a job 90 minutes away said she\u2019d be home by 9, wasn\u2019t. I called and texted repeatedly she came back after midnight no apology whatsoever just that someone had called out so she had to work late. Like she couldn\u2019t have texted me on her way home\nI was 100% convinced she\u2019d been in a car accident. The agency said we should call the police if the parents were unresponsive and I didn\u2019t because I was afraid she\u2019d get into trouble or id be bothering the police. I should have, you did the mature thing of calling your mom and the police. There\u2019s no excuse not to respond to your babysitters calls or to text if you are running late.", "NTA.

Kudos to you.", "NTA\n\nYou had a verbal contract with them that they broke.\n\nAnd I don't know anyone parent who doesn't keep their phone handy when they've left their kids with babysitters.", "they were banking on you doing nothing and staying overnight so that they could stay out longer.\n\nNTA. they specified a time they would be home. they did not hold to their end.", "Tell them they\u2019re not mature enough to be parents if that\u2019s how they behave.

I bet they had no intent on adjusting payment with overtime, either.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of parents leave a contact number and then completely ignore it. What if there was an emergency!

Submit a request for the record from the police department. If anyone asks, you can show them the call log and it\u2019ll prove you were in the right.

If they give you any more grief about calling the cops, inform them you will let all your friends of babysitting age know about them lying to you about what time they would be home, refusing to answer their phones or texts on a night when it was snowing heavily.  That will solve their babysitting issues because they will never be able to hire a babysitter again.  Then hang up, walk away, shut the door in their face - you don't owe them another word!  If they aren't going to apologize to you then do just that.  Tell all your friends and then refuse to babysit again.\n\nBack in the 1970's, I babysat for a couple that did the exact same thing.  They said they would be home at 11pm and I was still there at 2am.  This was before cell phones.  I knew the restaurant they had gone to closed at 11pm so I had no idea where they went and no places I could call to find them, so I had to wait.  I was 13 and furious when they got home.  The dad drove me home and was met in the driveway by my father.  Dad got up to get ready for work at 2:30am.  He was raging when he saw I wasn't home.  I didn't have to say anything - he said it all for me. My father sent me inside but I got to hear all of it from the entryway.  After the other dad left, my dad told me to do exactly what I told you - and I did.  I refused to babysit again for them and told all my friends.  That couple couldn't find a sitter to save their lives after that.  The mom constantly called and begged my mom to get me to reconsider but I refused.  \n\nDon't ever babysit again for them unless they apologize to you and your mom.  You can bet that if they refuse to apologize for their behavior, then it will be repeated again and again.

Not enough to be parents, and not enough to respect others time, don't sit for them anymore.", "So parents being negligible are saying you're not good for babysitting if you behave like this.\n\nI think you behaved more maturely than than them. If only they'd answered there f*ucking phones 2 and half hours earlier, the police won't be notified. Good Lord! I can't believe that people behave this erratically and then they try to teach others the rights And wrongs.\n\nNTA but the parents absolutely are who shouldn't be parents if they can't act properly.", "NTA", "Of course NTA. What bothers me the most is what if a medical emergency happened?  OP is 14 and cant drive.

If a parent leaves their kids with a sitter, they need to be checking their phone for calls/texts. Before cell phones, my parents would leave our sitters the phone number for the restaurant or movie theater or wherever they were going, even when our sitters were adults who could drive to the ER or wherever in an emergency.\n\nThey were not only an hour and a half late, but an hour and a half late without answering calls or texts. It was very reasonable of you to be worried. What you did was absolutely the mature thing-- trying to protect yourself and their kids and make sure adults knew what was going on and that the kids' parents were safe and were going to come home. Also, they were taking advantage of you, and they BETTER have paid you for all that time.\n\nETA: Also, even if you *had* been somewhat overcautious-- that is a *good* trait in a babysitter. When you're watching someone's children and aren't sure if a situation is serious or an emergency, it is a good thing to err on the side of caution and getting help to ensure things are okay.
