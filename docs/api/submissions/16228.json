My girlfriend Ivy and I were both eighteen and had just graduated highschool. Ivy wanted to abort, I wanted to keep him. We agreed that she would carry him to term, but that she\u2019d sign over all parental rights to me and have no responsibility to him. I raised him alone for seven years, until my wife Jane (34f) came into the picture. Jane legally adopted Ben two years ago, and was the only real mother figure in his life until one year ago, when Ivy showed up. She reached out to me via facebook and asked to meet Ben. I told Ben what was going on and gave him the choice, he said yes. The three of us met up at a diner, and the two had a very emotional conversation. They\u2019ve been in sparse contact even since. \n\nNow, I didn\u2019t know this at first, but Ivy has since converted to Catholicism. Now, I have no issues with her religion. However, she recently contacted me and asked me to send Ben to a local Catholic private school for highschool (he\u2019ll be a freshman next year). She explained that she wanted Ben to know her faith and that the school has a good reputation. She even offered to pay 2/3rds of the tuition. I said no. \n\nWhy I said no: \n \n- Neither Ben nor I are religious at all. \n- I asked Ben if he wants to go to the Catholic school or the local public highschool, and he said he\u2019d rather got to the public school to stay with his friends. \n- Tuition is quite expensive, and even 1/3rd would be a financial burden. \n- I\u2019ve heard horror stories about trauma from Catholic schools and I don\u2019t want to risk Ben being hurt. \n- Their curriculum isn\u2019t publicly available, and I don\u2019t know how they would teach science, sex ed, and history. I don\u2019t want him learning misogyny, purity culture, creationism, etc. \n\nEven with all these reasons, she\u2019s still Ben\u2019s mother and going against her wishes could risk their relationship.

She might guilt trip your son into doing what she wants.", "NTA \n\n\nShe's not Ben's mother. Legally, Jane is. Ivy has had no role in Ben's life for the last 14 years.

His biological mother has no legal rights to decide his education, and I don\u2019t think you have any moral obligation to bend to her wishes, especially against the desire of the child.\n\nIf Ben is open to learning more about her religion that could be fine.

When your wife adopted him she became his mom. You and his mom(wife) are the only one who gets to decide where he goes to school.\n\nAs far as his birth mom goes she should be thankful she has limited contact because honestly it was given as a courtesy.

She is not Ben's mother : she was the incubator that now want to earn the title of mother. \n\nAnd if she wants to be a good mother, she needs to understand that she needs to do what is best for her kid, not stick to what she wants for her kid.

The only way this choice would affect the relationship between Ben and Ivy would be if Ivy disappears again because she didn\u2019t get her way on religion/education.

You don't even mention her reaction to your decision, but its your decision to make, your reasons are sound, and his mother gave up parental rights so its 100% your decision to make.\n\nIts good that you are supportive of them having a relationship, and if she wants your son to know her faith, thats something you both can give your son the chance to choose, but it does not require going to a catholic school against your wishes.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing that matters is what your son wants, and if he doesn't want to go there he shouldn't be forced to.

PLUS you also asked your son what he wanted and *he* doesn't want to go to the private school. Do what *your son* wants here.. not his egg donor who dipped and then changed her mind 10+ years later. She should just count herself lucky he even *wants a relationship with her at all* and not push her luck by trying to separate him from his friends against his wishes and convert him to a faith he is not part of. Because if she keeps pushing Catholicism on him, she *will* push him away.", "NTA, legally, she isn't Ben's mom. Your wife is, how does she feel about all of this?

Stick to your guns.", "Absolutely NTA for saying no. \n\nI went to Catholic school for the first 14 years of my education and I promise you it's only harmful. You're making the right decision here. He's free to learn about her religion from her or if he really wants to be could attend her church. Subjecting him to this school would not be the smart move to help him learn about the religion when there are so many other options that don't throw his social life in the toilet and flip his world upside down. \n\nI did both the private Catholic school and public school so from personal experience of both I would highly suggest you hold your ground and offer her the option to teach him in any other way. \n\n\nAll that aside fuck no she doesn't get to show up 14 years later and start making decisions.

That\u2019s kind of a ridiculous request for the premise of learning about her religion. \n\nObviously no obligation on anyone\u2019s part, but if he\u2019s interested in getting to know his bio-mom and that part of her life more, maybe he could go to church with her some week. \n\nOr not, he\u2019s your kid, so you shouldn\u2019t feel the need to compromise.", "YWNBTA, but this seems\u2026 odd. Did she go to Catholic school?  Does it have something going for it that the local district does not? It seems like a weird thing to suddenly be invested in.", "Easy NTA she signed over her parental rights and you have raised him.

Though may want to pay attention to the interactions he has with the bio mom", "NTA not to sound mean or anything, but she gave up her right and you stepped up, she has no say imo.  Help keep your son happy and keep him where he is, if she doesn't like it, she can just disappear again.", "NTA. She is NOT his mother, at best she is an egg donor with residual guilt.

I'm sure her new found faith is filling her up with guilt, and it's nice of you to indulge her, but but she's not his mom and should have no say in how he is educated.

Ben should go to school where he feels most comfortable, with his friends.  Sending him to a Catholic school would only isolate him from being & hanging out with his friends the way he could if he went to the same school.

Ben has made his feelings clear on the subject & isn't interested in having religion shoved down his throat. Which is what would happen if he went to this private school.

IF he wants to learn her faith, he can go to church with her. The part about the curriculum made me laugh because my dad went to Catholic school, and he was definitely taught those subjects.", "NTA. She gave up her parental rights, which means she gave up any authority on making decisions for him. She is less a mother and more of an egg donor. I'm assuming she hasn't offered to pay tuition, so she's also trying to saddle your household with a big expense. More important than that, Ben doesn't want to go to Catholic school.

Jane is his mom. Ivy has no rights to make any decisions about his life. She can\u2019t just step back in and demand to make decisions about his life. End of story. \n\nLegally you didn\u2019t even have to let her see him.", ">she\u2019s his mom and she should have the right to be involved in his education.\n\nLOL NOPE.\n\nJane is his mom. She's the woman who's been a mother to him in Ivy's absence, and legally via adoption.", "I kind of figured it would have been something like that. Regardless, she chose to give up parental rights, she doesnt get to just show up 14 years later and demand the right to force her beliefs on your son.", "While she's his bio mom, she's not legally or practically his mom. Jane is his mom. Your ex made the choice to sign away her parental rights, which means she has no input on how he's raised -- including his schooling. She can't just take it back and act as if the last 14 years never happened. It's very troubling that she is trying to push this. Maybe she needs a reminder that she actually made the choice long ago to not be his mom. She's really overstepping by bringing this up at all.", "It's hard to say with Catholic schools. I attended a mix of public schools, Catholic schools and military schools. \n\nThe Catholic schools I attended weren't bad. The education was much better than in some of the public schools I went to. In one place, non-Catholic parents sent their kids to the Catholic high schools, because the public schools were a mess, with drugs and knifings and gangs. \n\nScience classes taught evolution, and we had sex education, but no mention of birth control. No purity culture, just strict warnings that you could get pregnant the very first time you had sex--and the assumption that this was not a good thing.\n\nBut these schools were all in the Northeast US, and I could see Catholic schools in other parts of the country handling things very differently. Just as public schools in various parts of the US handle some subjects very differently. \n\nBottom line, Ivy isn't his mom. And Ben doesn't want to go to Catholic school. End of discussion.", "She has no right to be involved in his education. She is not his mother in the eyes of the law. Please stop this non sense. She can't come back now and make the call. \n\nThose videos are info commercials. Please don't doubt yourself. She found faith good for her but she can't make her child obligated to share the same faith or to have an interest in it.", "That's what's important. You, Jane, and Ben are on the same page.", "I get it.  Some Catholic schools could probably be a bit scary, but for the most part, even though they \"force\" religion on the kids (going to church, taking religion classes), they don't REALLY force it on them.  I went to Catholic school & I don't always agree with their religion. I made my own choices by believing what I thought was right.  ANY religion that is taken to the extreme is what is scary.  But anyway, stand your ground here. Just bc she found religion doesn't mean she gets to force it on YOUR son. Good luck!"]}
