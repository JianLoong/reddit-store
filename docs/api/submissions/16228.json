My girlfriend Ivy and I were both eighteen and had just graduated highschool. Ivy wanted to abort, I wanted to keep him. We agreed that she would carry him to term, but that she\u2019d sign over all parental rights to me and have no responsibility to him. I raised him alone for seven years, until my wife Jane (34f) came into the picture. Jane legally adopted Ben two years ago, and was the only real mother figure in his life until one year ago, when Ivy showed up. She reached out to me via facebook and asked to meet Ben. I told Ben what was going on and gave him the choice, he said yes. The three of us met up at a diner, and the two had a very emotional conversation. They\u2019ve been in sparse contact even since. \n\nNow, I didn\u2019t know this at first, but Ivy has since converted to Catholicism. Now, I have no issues with her religion. However, she recently contacted me and asked me to send Ben to a local Catholic private school for highschool (he\u2019ll be a freshman next year). She explained that she wanted Ben to know her faith and that the school has a good reputation. She even offered to pay 2/3rds of the tuition. I said no. \n\nWhy I said no: \n \n- Neither Ben nor I are religious at all. \n- I asked Ben if he wants to go to the Catholic school or the local public highschool, and he said he\u2019d rather got to the public school to stay with his friends. \n- Tuition is quite expensive, and even 1/3rd would be a financial burden. \n- I\u2019ve heard horror stories about trauma from Catholic schools and I don\u2019t want to risk Ben being hurt. \n- Their curriculum isn\u2019t publicly available, and I don\u2019t know how they would teach science, sex ed, and history. I don\u2019t want him learning misogyny, purity culture, creationism, etc. \n\nEven with all these reasons, she\u2019s still Ben\u2019s mother and going against her wishes could risk their relationship.

She might guilt trip your son into doing what she wants.", "NTA \n\n\nShe's not Ben's mother. Legally, Jane is. Ivy has had no role in Ben's life for the last 14 years.

When your wife adopted him she became his mom. You and his mom(wife) are the only one who gets to decide where he goes to school.\n\nAs far as his birth mom goes she should be thankful she has limited contact because honestly it was given as a courtesy.

The only way this choice would affect the relationship between Ben and Ivy would be if Ivy disappears again because she didn\u2019t get her way on religion/education.

You don't even mention her reaction to your decision, but its your decision to make, your reasons are sound, and his mother gave up parental rights so its 100% your decision to make.\n\nIts good that you are supportive of them having a relationship, and if she wants your son to know her faith, thats something you both can give your son the chance to choose, but it does not require going to a catholic school against your wishes.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing that matters is what your son wants, and if he doesn't want to go there he shouldn't be forced to.

Stick to your guns.", "Absolutely NTA for saying no. \n\nI went to Catholic school for the first 14 years of my education and I promise you it's only harmful. You're making the right decision here. He's free to learn about her religion from her or if he really wants to be could attend her church. Subjecting him to this school would not be the smart move to help him learn about the religion when there are so many other options that don't throw his social life in the toilet and flip his world upside down. \n\nI did both the private Catholic school and public school so from personal experience of both I would highly suggest you hold your ground and offer her the option to teach him in any other way. \n\n\nAll that aside fuck no she doesn't get to show up 14 years later and start making decisions.

Did she go to Catholic school?  Does it have something going for it that the local district does not? It seems like a weird thing to suddenly be invested in.", "Easy NTA she signed over her parental rights and you have raised him.

Though may want to pay attention to the interactions he has with the bio mom", "NTA not to sound mean or anything, but she gave up her right and you stepped up, she has no say imo.

Ben has made his feelings clear on the subject & isn't interested in having religion shoved down his throat. Which is what would happen if he went to this private school.

IF he wants to learn her faith, he can go to church with her. The part about the curriculum made me laugh because my dad went to Catholic school, and he was definitely taught those subjects.", "NTA. She gave up her parental rights, which means she gave up any authority on making decisions for him. She is less a mother and more of an egg donor.

I do appreciate that you are trying to respect her as Ben\u2019s mother, even if she did sign over her rights. Having a child that young (and it sounds like she didn\u2019t want to do that, you did) is hard no matter what. I hope your son will develop a good relationship with her. I doubt you politely declining her offer to pay 2/3 of the tuition will risk her relationship with Ben. If she wants a relationship with him she will try to build one (and I hope you will support that). \n\nThat said, Catholic schools tend to provide a good education and I\u2019ve never heard of one that teaches creationism. There is a religious education component but plently of non-Catholic children attend catholic school. The one I attended for middle and high school had Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and non-religious students in attendance. The religion classes covered a number of different faiths and was more like a history class. We also learned meditation. And just because the curriculum isn\u2019t publicly available doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they wouldn\u2019t provide it to you if you requested it. \n\nI say all that to say that it might be worth looking into a little more to see if your son might benefit from attending (smaller class sizes, a strong sports or arts program, etc.) I know I benefitted from the smaller classes sizes at my Catholic high school - maybe because I had undiagnosed (at the time) adhd. And I received a better education than many of my peers at the (highly rated, blue ribbon) public school (i know because I tutored one and helped others with papers/homework). Not to say that\u2019s always the case, that was just my experience. \n\nBut yeah anyway, you are not obligated to send your kid to a different school if that doesn\u2019t work for you.

She never once mothered him. She gets ZERO say.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m Catholic. It doesn\u2019t really make sense to start  Ben in a Catholic high school from a teaching the faith perspective. The benefit of having a child attend Catholic school as they grow up (or CCD/PREP) is that it\u2019s way less work to receive the Catholic sacraments gradually over the years than to deal with the annoyance of attending RCIA as an adult, which is what is necessary for adult converts. There\u2019s no such benefit for Ben. And he doesn\u2019t have some type of long-standing parent-child relationship with Ivy, so it\u2019s not as if he\u2019s used to growing up around a practicing Catholic and the experience would be normalized for him.\n\nAs far as the educational concerns, you have a mixed bag. Realistically, sex ed is handled at the middle school level, so it\u2019s not really going to be an issue no matter where you go. The Catholic Church absolutely is misogynistic, but the type of purity culture that you\u2019re thinking of is Protestant (The Catholic Church tends to be uncomfortable with talking about sex in general outside of the context of babies and has plenty of its own hang ups, but if you\u2019re envisioning the promise rings where girls commit their chastity to their fathers, that\u2019s not a Catholic thing). You would have zero concern when it comes to academic standards: The Catholic Church has no issue with evolution, for instance, and, again, the type of academic concerns that you have apply to Protestant Evangelicals, not Catholics. You absolutely should be able to obtain a curriculum from the school if you were interested. There\u2019s a reason that in places where the local school district is weaker, Catholic schools often include a significant number of non-Catholic students. \n\nAlso, a private Catholic high school could mean very different things: Is the same same-sex or co-ed? Is it a standard diocesan high school or a more elite (for lack of a better word) college prep school? Because the first type of school isn\u2019t helpful for you\u2014It\u2019s essentially the high school version of the Catholic school tied to the local Catholic Church. The latter could be interesting, depending on the quality of your local public school, in terms of offering a more rigorous curriculum.\n\nBut, of course, none of that matters if Ben is happy at his current school, you feel confident in the school, and the additional expense is both unneeded and unhelpful. \n\nIvy has been out of Ben\u2019s life for years. Ben\u2019s high school education is a decision for Ben, Jane, and you. If Ivy\u2019s relationship with Ben is ruined because you won\u2019t forced him to attend a school that he doesn\u2019t want to attend, then Ivy isn\u2019t serious about having a relationship with Ben, just controlling him.", "You're wrong, her input doesn't count because she gave up her rights as mother 14 years ago so what are you thinking! \n\nIf this were a non-religious private school it would be worth considering but by sending him to a religious school she is now trying to impose her \"new found\" religion on the son she gave up! \n\nSon doesn't want to go so end of discussion !

We live in Metro Detroit, and this area has a very large number of Catholic schools. I've not heard of a single instance of trauma. Yes, they teach evolution, and the grade schools teach sex ed just like the public schools. Yes, they do also teach creationism, as well as the histories of religions around the world.

Your letting her think she has a say. You need to set boundaries. You and your wife are his parents and you 2 decide what his path is.  She doesn\u2019t get to waltz back into peoples lives she  abandoned because she had a come to Jesus moment.", "She has ZERO rights. Signed them away at Ben's birth, a decision she implemented for 14 years. Jane is his mother in fact and in law - through her heart, her commitment, and by adoption. \n\nRepeat after me, OP: IVY HAS NO RIGHTS AND IS NOT BEN'S \"MOM\". Just tell her she missed that boat by 14 years and she can find atonement or whatever she is suddenly looking for in the confession booth. By herself.", "Majority here are assuming due to the OP not listing all details about this event. My assumption that the education is probably better is due to the simple fact that private school education in my country is far superior to public school education and this could set him up for his adult life.", "Where I live, the public schools have to bus the kids to the private school. (Not disagreeing with your comment just an fyi)", "It's weird that you think it's weird. He's literally acknowledging that he can tell his judgment is being clouded by strong emotions from long ago. He should go to therapy if they continue to interfere but it's certainly not weird.", "NTA\u2026however- there is indoctrination in both public and catholic schools. \n\nMost private schools get through the public school curriculum way faster. \n\nThe networking opportunities are insanely good. \n\nBut\u2026it\u2019s your kid not hers", "NTA, Ben said no.", "NTA, (as someone who thinks that the catholic school might be a better choice). But it\u2019s still a decision between you and your son, ivy gets no vote.", "NTA, definitely don't send a kid to a catholic school unless they want to be there. \n\nBeing forced into a religion against your will has a 100% success rate of turning you off to said religion", "NTA.\n\nShe has no parental rights. She is a birth parent. End of story. That is how she wanted it and that is how it is. You need to establish some serious boundaries because Ivy has no idea what it is to be a parent. You don't want to hinder their relationship, but you really need to protect your son. That is what a parent does.", "She wants him to know \u201cher\u201d religion???  WTF does that even mean? Why? If he wants to immerse himself into Catholicism he can, but to toss him into it unwillingly\u2026.NO! NTA", "She legally signed away her rights.  What she wants or doesn\u2019t want is wholly irrelevant.  Just because she found Jesus doesn\u2019t mean she gets to force her brand on a child she gave up.  Honestly, you were generous in allowing her to meet with your son.  You and your family are not Catholic, there is no reason for her to try and get him to attend a Catholic school.", "NTA. She's his birth mother but she is not his parent. She can ask, but she's not in a position to make demands. Besides, your son's opinion matters and he doesn't want to go.", "From a catholic school survivor here, you made the right decision ! NTA", "She is **NOT** his mother and your son's wants and needs trump those of his **egg donor**.\n\nNTA but get your head on straight\n\nETA what does his actual mother, your wife, think?", "NTA. She's legally not his mom, has no weight in any decisions made, and none in his life at all.", "NTA. You are his father and legally she has no say. On top of that all the reasons you listed for not wanting to send him at valid and thoughtful. If he doesn\u2019t want to go, that should be it. Not seeing the curriculum and being worried about sex Ed/science, etc. is a REAL concern. Good for you. You seem like a great dad!", "Absolutely NTA... \n\nBut just to give you more information (from an atheist).\n\nCatholics believe 100% in science. So he wouldn't learn creationism or any kind of science denial you see in Protestanism. Catholic schools and universities are among the highest rated ones. So in education quality, he probably will get a much better education in the catholic school.\n\nAs for purity culture, misogyny, sex ed, etc... it will be another thing and depend on who's running the school and how.\n\nI went to a Catholic private school, a 7th Day Adventist private school, a secular private school and public school. My Catholic school was pretty much secular even with comparative religion classes where we learned about other faiths (in a very secular way), while the 7th Day was the opposite, full of religion indoctrination and science denial.\n\n______________\n\nIf I were you I would listen to my kid wants in the first place. But also... this could be a great opportunity for him to have a better education he wouldn't have otherwise.\n\nSo why not schedule a visit to the school with your son so you both can have all the information you need in order to make an fully informed choice.", "Dude people love to pile on, but I don\u2019t think ivy is a bad person at all. She carried a 9 month pregnancy at 18 against her wishes so OP could be a parent, let\u2019s not underplay her sacrifice in regards to the child. I do agree the son shouldn\u2019t go to catholic school but still let\u2019s be respectful of the biomom.", "Dude seriously, you don\u2019t see any difference. Like the 9 months of pregnancy and the hormones, or the extremely painful birthing process at the age of 18."]}
