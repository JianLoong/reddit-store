That will mean you'll be less able to help her and other people later on.  Also, you need to save as much as possible because she won't be able to help you.\n\nHowever, I don't trust her.  She seems to be taking advantage.  It would be totally absurd for you to be covering most of the rent while living in the tiniest room with no bathroom.  Don't do it.  Because she has suggested this, I think you should be careful.  I would not trust her to do what's good for you.\n\nOf course you're not being picky and it's worrying you think you are.

It's not okay to be taken advantage of by ungrateful people without your consent.\n\nAre you really saving money by paying 70% rent for two bedrooms?  You have your own salary.  You get to decide how to spend it.  You don't have to save as much for later if you are miserable now.  You can probably get a one bedroom or studio for that price.  This would not make you a bad person, just a wise one.", "NTA. Whoever gets the bigger room and own bathroom should pay more.", "It would be an ass hole move to not tell her how you feel and then just bow to her requests.

It is important to live within your means and you are a recent graduate, you should be saving your extra funds, not subsidizing your sister.  You stated the reason you were going to live together was to save money - remember that.\n\nRather than have you pay more, settle on an apartment where she can afford 50% and then if you don't care, she can have the nicer bed/bath combo, but you each pay the same.

So if the second bedroom is 120sq/ft, and the master/ensuite is 360sq/ft, then the person with the ensuite will pay 3/4 of the rent.  If she wants you to pay the majority of the rent, then you get the space that is equivalent to that.   \n    \nIf she keeps throwing a fit, just get your own apartment and tell her \"I don't think being roommates will work out for me.\"", "Better get this corrected and in writing or trouble will roll down like thunder.\n\n>I cannot pay more than her (70% of the total rent) for a smaller room that does not have an ensuite and she said that I am being picky and since I make way more money than her", "NTA. Get a different roommate.", "NTA. The fact that you're going to pay more rent should entitle you to the larger room and the ensuite. \n\nFurthermore, she's in school, so she will likely be out more of the time than you will be anyway. She will have classes at differing times of the day and be coming in and out the home. The smaller room and communal bath should be fine for the person paying less rent.", "NTA. \n\nIf your sister can't handle the reality that the person who pays more should get the bigger room, AND when you point out you don't want to pay more for a small room she calls you \"picky\", it's probably better not to move in together. \n\nBecause any reasonable person would appreciate that getting someone else to pay more means they get more space, or at least the space should be equal. Just because you make more doesn't mean your sister- or anyone else- should benefit from that. And so if this is her approach \"I get what I want, you better not complain\", then living with her is likely going to be a nightmare. She will eat your food, she won't clean, she will have friends over and be loud, and if you complain, she will tell you to get over it, no big deal, stop being picky. \n\nI just get that vibe, and think you should back out now before it is too late!", "NTA, but I wouldn't live with this sister.\n\nIf you pay the most rent, YOU get the master bedroom and ensuite bathroom.

But, are you SURE you want to move in with her? She sounds awfully selfish and entitled; I'm thinking you'd be better off on your own.", "NTA\n\nYou intended to be nice to your sister and now she's taking advantage.  \n\nIf your sister wants an ensuite, she needs to pay for it.  And if you're paying half (or more), then your room needs to be a reasonable price.\n\nBut, no, you shouldn't pay 70% of the total rent so she can have a large room with an ensuite while you have tiny rehoming fee m with a common bathroom.\n\nYou need to tell her that you aren't interested in paying so much for so little space.  And if the two of you can't come to an agreement, you should step back from leasing together.  At a guess, you might even be able to rent a one bedroom flat all to yourself for about what you're planning to pay here.  \n\nStop treating your sister like she needs you to take care of her.  It's time for her to learn to be more independent.", "I think it's time to find your own place. She's wanting to dictate far too much for someone not paying half.
