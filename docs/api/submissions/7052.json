You can tell tjhem you are not asking that he be dsiciplined at this time but you want them to be aare of the situation in case his behviour gets worse or he tried to retlaaliate for the percieved slight.", "NTA since he deserved it, but in future you could definitely be more tactful. I get that when someone acts like that you feel like they need a dose of reality, but it might be more effective to say \u2018really? It was the worst gift because it was the wrong colour? So you think they should have been able to guess what colour you wanted?

It's one thing if you have someone you are close to (family or friends) that have this nervous energy. I mean... it needs to be addressed but presumably this is a relationship worth preserving so you ask them to go to therapy. But this is a *coworker*. You do not have that close of a relationship. If he is impacting his other coworkers to that degree then the company should be nipping that behavior in the bud.  \n\n\nYou are NTA. Your coworker is definitely the AH. Perhaps he needs therapy, perhaps he's just an AH. But his behavior is unacceptable.  \n\n\nYou know who else is an AH? Your boss. This behavior should not have escalated to this point.

I\u2019m so glad I work remote and don\u2019t have to worry about secret Santa or that one random coworker that gets everyone a gift even when we said no and makes me feel guilty.

Because if otters are meant to be a certain colour (real ones) and a stuffy is different that could be upsetting to someone who is challenged.", "NTA. Sure, it wasn't good that you snapped maybe, but also honestly he needs to face the consequences of his behaviour sometimes.\n\nImagine if you took the same emotional space at him - I can't imagine him reacting well to someone expressing any sort of disappointment at all with the gift *he* gave.\n\nAlso, I'm autistic and have anxiety, and if someone gave me a penguin gift that was cartoony in the wrong way, and I had a bad day already, I might in fact get seriously stressed out by it. But my bad reaction would be limited to not being able to make a convincing show of thankfulness, and then maybe being stressed out by the fact that I was just rude (and yes, then maybe crying in the bathroom and going home early).\n\nAnd that's where its clear to me that he goes from just suffering from anxiety (which is something that people should accommodate within reason) to just being an asshole. Because he's not just being privately upset, he's being upset and making that everyone else's problem.", "Everything you've said about this guy makes me think he has some kind of cognitive/development disability in addition to anxiety that you are fully aware but unsympathetic to.
