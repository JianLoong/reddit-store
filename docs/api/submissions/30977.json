I\u2019ve had Emily from 3yrs to 8yrs old and she went to live w/Mona and Mona decided a yr later she didn\u2019t want her anymore and gave her back to me. She has been w/me ever since. So I told Mona no because I don\u2019t know who these people are, they can contact me and after investigating them myself I would think about it. She got mad. I wrote her a letter telling her that even though she birthed her I am the mom and I make those decisions not her. She got upset at the letter and called my mother who raised her cussing at her and yelling at her. FYI; my mom is recovering from a stroke and we take her to her doctors apptmnts and the doctor literally said no stress. So I want to block the number to the prison permanently stop her from lashing out at my mom but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a good idea to stop her from speaking to the mother who raised her.
