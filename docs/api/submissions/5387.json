My sister has 2 kids and recently had her tubes tied due to feeling that's as many kids as she wanted, which is a valid choice! I'll admit I'm a bit flaunty about being pregnant, but at most, I'll just be overly giddy while talking about it. I'm not going out of my way to rub it in, nor do I want to offend. I've gotten quite a bit of attention due to the pregnancy as one would expect. (It was the same for my sister when she was pregnant as well.) And of course, given her tubes being tied, I worried she may feel left out or even jealous to an extent but she's always assuring me she's fine so I continue to document the pregnancy and prep for these little bundles of joy.\n\n\n\nIt's about month 5 that I noticed she's become more passive-aggressive about it. Comments like \"Oh, you must be soooo happy to have so many eyes on you\" and \"Wish I could experience the magic of a pregnancy again...\" Once again, the last thing I wanna do is make her uncomfortable, but she's adamant she's totally cool with all this. I definitely try to tone it down from here since I sense she's a bit bothered by it. This all continues until now when our mother throws a baby shower for me, and she is tasked with helping. According to our mom, she just flatout refused to be involved with her reasoning being that it's apparently not fair that she can't experience all this again and that I shouldn't be getting all this attention. \n\n\n\nI tried to call her, but she refused to answer, so after texting her and wanting to know if she was okay, I get a long, expletive, filled rant about how I don't deserve all this attention and its not fair I get to be a mom while she can't have anymore kids. Keep in mind that she made the choice to get her tubes tied all on her own. She made it clear she didn't want more kids. I mean, I understand the empty nest feeling, but her kids hardly 5 yet. Shouldn't that be where she should be looking to feel the joys of motherhood? I feel awful that she can't have more kids, but how is that my fault? I'm over the moon to have kids. Why would that make her so upset?\n\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1671717673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsmr3n/aita_for_being_open_about_my_pregnancy_despite_my/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was going to give sister a bit of grace since i felt bad for her infertility, except she is not infertile. She has two children and made a choice to sterilize herself. She could literally untie her tubes and risk it if it means that much to her but you have no obligation to baby her about your baby.", "We really need a WTF judgement around here... she is not infertile, she had a voluntary procedure to ensure she would not have anymore kids. NTA\n At all.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a narcissist. She got all that attention when she had her 2 kids but now that it's your turn for the love and attention you're not worthy? What the hell kind of logic is that? \n\nAs you said, SHE MADE HER OWN CHOICE and now you're suffering the consequences of that. Ridiculous. Hopefully she can see how much of a bitch she's being and come to realize that it's not about her right now. Live your life and be happy about this miracle you're carrying - do whatever you want and don't worry about Debbie downer as there's nothing you can do to appease her at this point.", "NTA.\n\n\nYour sister is after attention, plain and simple. This isn't about having another kid. It's about being the centre of attention, which it seems she got during her pregnancy. You did nothing wrong here, and if anything, you did the right thing by making sure your sis wasn't uncomfortable by all this.", "NTA. Your sister needs therapy. She is a mother, she has kids, very young kids apparently. She doesn't want to be a mother again, she just seems to resent that she won't get to be pregnant and get the attention that comes with it, again. Which is a very toxic approach to motherhood. \n\nShe chose not to have any more children, which is respectable and, if she did so because she thinks she couldn't handle or give a good quality of life to any more children, then she made the right choice. But it seems she doesn't think the same, so a professional could help her navigate her feelings. \n\nNone of it is your fault. You have a right to enjoy your pregnancy and your motherhood. You have a right to celebrate this with your loved ones. \n\nShe's throwing a tantrum. And she's way too old for that.", "NTA. It's not about you being pregnant but the attention you're getting. She's jealous because she does not get the spotlight. She had her tube tied on her own, which further implies that being unable to conceive is not the issue here. With an attitude like that, I'm glad she had a tubal ligation because it seems like she's not gonna be a great mom.", "There is a sort of post partum depression that comes with sterilization. I never even wanted kids, I went into my medically needed hysterectomy with a hell yea let's do this attitude and I still wept afterwards, it was really weird tbh.\n\nI'm not justifying her taking out on you, just empathizing with sis a bit. \n\nNTA\n\nETA when I say I never wanted kids I mean since I very first started my period I wanted a hysterectomy. Some of us know in our bones that motherhood isn't for us. I was shocked I had any reaction aside from relief that finally, after 25 years I got what I always wanted.\n\nIt wasn't just weird for me to react that way it was uncharacteristic. \n\nThis phase isn't something that gets talked about or dealt with at all. I can't say NTA enough I just, oof I feel for your sis too", "NTA. As a sister and a mother - and, let's face it, a human being - she should be supporitng you and doing her best to make sure you're happy and healthy during pregnancy.", "NTA.\n\nIf she wanted to be pregnant again, why would she decide to go and have her tubes tied? There are other reversible ways for birth control. I think that she's just jealous that you are getting attention now. Maybe the best way to handle this is to ignore her and keep on with your own life.", "NTA...Enjoy your pregnancy.  Your sister made choices that were appropriate for her.  That's not your problem. Be happy and let other people's problems be theirs alone.", "NTA.. Your sister CHOSE to have her tubes tied. I could see if she was unable or had health issues / complications prior, but that's not the case here. She made the choice. She has zero right to be pissy towards you. I'm sure she was gitty and super excited during her first pregnancy (I know my wife and I were). For your sister to show animosity towards you for something she experienced twice and to put a damper on your excitement during your first pregnancy is pathetic and inexcusable. Ignore her. Don't let her ruin this. Don't feed her seeking of sympathy.", "NTA. Being pregnant is pretty exciting and although you note that you've been a little over the top about it its still exciting to be bringing a baby into your life. I'm going to assume that you were a happy helpful sister when she was having kids and you expected the same.\n\n Your sister is having problems with her last child being her last child I think she most likely under estimated how she'd feel about no more babies ever. Don't concentrate on her negative comments. Focus on doing everything you need to bring a happy, healthy baby into the world.", "NTA. Your sister seems to be using her choice as a weapon against you in order to get attention. To me, her real problem isn't that you're pregnant, it's that you're getting all the attention. It's time for her to grow up, imagine if in the future she also uses special moments in her children's lives against them because she is not being the center of attention?", "NTA. Your sister is a narcissist. She can't have another person in the spotlight. That's all.", "NTA\n\nSeriously stop thinking you might be an AH, and stop accepting this treatment and being made to feel this way.\n\nYou dont have kids, she has two. This isnt a sibling who is infertile and never experienced birth or children. She didnt become infertile either - she chose to tie her tubes.\n\nDid you throw a tantrum like this during her two pregnancies?\n\nStop being so gullible and tell her out right if this is how she is behaving then she stay away from. Why is acceptable she wants more than you and to make you feel bad for finally having a child.  Tell her its horrifying that she is ruining your experience and how little she thinks of you.\n\nShe needs to be grateful she has two healthy young children. She wants more kids - she can adopt. Motherhood is not pregnancy, its not having a baby. Her kid is 5 - she is literally experiencing mother hood. There are so many who will never ever be able to experience that and she is so ungrateful.", "NTA your sis doesn't want more kids... she just wants more attention, at least more attention than you. Don't let her rain on your parade.", "NTA. You're allowed to feel special in your pregnancy, this is your time. I would just try to ignore her petty jealousy.", "Being pregnant is about getting attention now ? When did this happen ?  Why would she be jealous of you ? She\u2019s probably just annoyed.", "NTA. Your sister is the one being an ass because she\u2019s obviously very jealous.  Carry on and ignore her. Don\u2019t let poison your happiness.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She made her own decision to have her tubes tied and I don't understand why she wants to deny you the same joy she probably felt having her own children.\n\nThat being said, some people can have something called Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome PTLS where you could have problematic physical and mental symptoms (You may have to ask someone close to her to see if she has changed behaviour in regards to other things recently).
