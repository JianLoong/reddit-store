I'm all for random \"I'm thinking of you\" gifts but I think it would be stressful and inconvenient for other people because it's not a practical way to participate in mutual gift giving.\n\nA specific holiday gives people time throughout the year to save up, think of gift ideas, and shop. Consumerism around Christmas can definitely diminish the joy of gift giving and make it feel like an obligation, but people aren't inherently thinking of each other less or being less nice by giving gifts at this time of year. \n\nAnd how would your approach work in terms of reciprocity? When I give gifts outside of special occasions, I don't expect anything back at any point. But if that's the only way someone close to me wanted to give gifts, I'd feel stressed by the lack of \"rules\". There's no agreed upon time frame for reciprocating and no convenient time to discuss budgets and wish lists.

I love them, but that doesn't mean I have to buy stupid knick knacks to prove it (and I can't afford to get them all the stuff they are dreaming about). We spend the holidays together, usually doing fun things, and that is more than enough. \n\nI'd reconsider my relationship with anyone who felt like gift giving for any reason is obligatory, and who think it's ok to take you to task over it like you were a child and they had authority over your choices. \n\nNTA.", "Yta\n\nFake it until you make it. \nBuy everyone something generic, maybe a box of cookies or something or a bottle of wine.
