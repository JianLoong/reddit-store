While one is much worse than the other, it is out of control for both of them. Not spam mail, but real stuff - that you typically would want to see if it is sent to you. Today alone, I got an appointment reminder for a dermatology appointment, a plastic surgery appointment, the school bus schedule, a payment reminder for electricity, and the worst one,  burial information for some dude named Ralph for his funeral on the 15th. \n\nI have both their addresses since I also get the 'Shop' app delivery notifications for one and UPS for the other. I have sent both snail mail and also have sent emails to what should be the correct email addresses from people that were kind enough to provide them. Neither responded. While this might sound like a minor annoyance, it really isn't. I am constantly having to verify these things aren't intended for me, especially the collections/demands for payments or the medical stuff since one of them shares the same group medical provider as me in Michigan. The kicker? Half the stuff I try to sign up for legitimately, it tells me I can't because my email is already in use and it wants to send a verification code to their phone number...\n\n  \nSo...today I had enough and I canceled a dermatology appointment for her kid (I assume) and a botox appointment off the appointment reminders. AITA? Obviously, they don't really care, but maybe they will if I start wasting their time too.\n\nEdited to add/update: \nSince I am getting a lot of the same questions I thought I would answer them here! \n\n1. Why don\u2019t I just change my email? \nI have had my email since gmail was brand new. I thought it was 15 years ago, but when looking it was actually 2004, so 19 years ago. It\u2019s simply my name, like FirstLast@gmail.com. I\u2019m not giving it up, as I\u2019m not willing to spend days updating my email with every company and contact I have had in 19 years.  It sounds as bad as changing your name honestly. \n\n2. Why not just hit unsubscribe or block? A lot of these are for services I also use. UPS, my doctors office (I am in Michigan only about 30 mins from her in Ohio, and she uses Michigan doctors) pharmacies, rideshare and food delivery services, shopping sites, etc. The biggest problem is many services now use two factor, so when I try and sign up or use something, my email already exists and it sends a text to their phone. \n\n3. It\u2019s just spam, it\u2019s no big deal. \nIt\u2019s really not. It\u2019s a lot of personal stuff they really probably want! I even occasionally get her notes to herself like dear diary style. I know when her boyfriend came home late or she slipped up and drank and even ate too many carbs. I email those back the email it comes from and it bounces as a \u2018no reply\u2019 note to self as I\u2019m guessing she set that up wrong too. You aren\u2019t getting your notes, girl. Why aren\u2019t you looking for them?", "created_utc": 1691695722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nluzr/aita_for_canceling_appointments_for_someone_who/", "score": 813, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hell, I\u2019ve received voicemails where people would pop off about the call not being answered and more even though my voice mail is one I recorded and clearly not a business number.\n\nStory time about my favorite interaction with someone calling for the hotel. A man called looking to make a reservation, I explained the mix up and even told him which two numbers to switch so he could call the correct number (the hotel had my number listed as theirs on google at the time). So, he calls back several times. The first time he called back I answered and said hey, you misdialed again, and agreed to send the correct number in a text thinking he would click it and call from that. Nope, dude continues calling over and over. Eventually I answered and told him to stop, he should\u2019ve managed to dial the correct number at least once at this point. This guy POPPED OFF. He told me I must be lying, that I must have changed the hotels voicemail to avoid answering calls from customers and trick them (he had left me a couple voicemails at that point). I hung up on him and he called again several times, so I answered again after ignoring a few calls. This guy was relentless, he wouldn\u2019t stop calling and was definitely in the mood to yell. I could barely get a word in, but eventually I got the chance to speak. Instead of explaining again, I just pretended he was right and that I was an employee. I \u201cbooked\u201d him a suite with a hefty discount and said that some extra perks would be comped for him. Then \u201cconfirmed\u201d his reservation the next day and offered late check out.\n\nLater on I was showing a friend the voicemails and in one of them he said something about how he kept clicking the number on google to call, that he knew the front desk employee (apparently me lol) tried to trick him by sending an identical number and how I must have been trying to scam him, but he wasn\u2019t falling for it and wouldn\u2019t call the number I provided. In that moment, the frustration he had caused was worth it. It gets better though, it really does. I had decided to wait until his \u201ccheck in\u201d date to block his number. When this guy arrived at the hotel and was told that he did not have a reservation, he called to prove that they were wrong, he did have one. I answered and he began yelling. Once I was able to have a chance to speak I told him that I had told him several times he had the wrong number, that I had provided the correct one even though I didn\u2019t have to and he was capable of finding the correct number on his own through the actual hotel website since the one on google is wrong. He tried to double down at first, but he eventually handed the phone over to the manager that had come out to deal with him. The manager apologized to me for the inconvenience, but said it was rude for me to make a fake reservation since he had to deal with the consequences of it. I mean, yeah, it was rude, but I had been trying to get them to fix it. Hell, it wasn\u2019t even a hard thing to fix on his end.
