My extended  *was* close. My cousin (17m) called my mom from work crying a few weeks ago bc he and his dad had gotten into it and his dad, O, told him after work to leave the phone that he bought him and the keys to the car he bought him on the counter and to \u201cget the f out of *his* house\u201d. He asked my mom if he could crash at her house for a few days until things calmed down and he and his dad could talk. Of course she said yes and sent my youngest sister (18f) to pick him up.\n\nNot 2 hours later uncle texts my sister something to the effect of \u201cyou have no idea the hell you and your mom just brought down on your family\u201d\u2014 later found out the stepmom, N, (only married to uncle for the last 2 years) had said my sister was lucky she didn\u2019t see her.\n\nA few days go by, I\u2019m at an urgent care on my lunch break for unrelated medical issues and I get a text from my sister saying there are cops at moms house (she helps me by watching my son while I\u2019m at work). I ask her what\u2019s going on. She says N called the cops to moms house and then it was radio silence. I know that cousin, my sister, my son (2) and my niece (1) are there and everyone over the age of 18 is at work so I\u2019m losing my shit worrying. I don\u2019t have N\u2019s number so I go around trying to get it to ask what is going on. Uncle sends a message through cousin\u2019s older sister (18) that I\u2019m not allowed to talk to N because I\u2019m not an adult ? I shouldn\u2019t have since they were using the older sister as communication and I should\u2019ve let it go and not involve her but I said something to the effect of \u201cN is lucky I\u2019m an hour away right now\u201d.\n\n30 minutes or so later I\u2019m out of urgent care not feeling any better but going back to work and I get back to back calls from a number I don\u2019t recognize. I finally answer and it\u2019s N frantically saying she has the police with her who ever so *politely* tell me that it\u2019s in my best interests to not communicate with N any further\n\nApparently N told them she\u2019s cousin\u2019s mom and legal guardian (she\u2019s neither) and didn\u2019t know where cousin was or if he was ok (but sent them directly to my moms house?). Thankfully my stepdad had worked from home that day and explained the situation to the officers who left when they realized they had been lied to and roped into family bs. Uncle cried to the rest of the extended family about the situation who all said they weren\u2019t getting involved but they\u2019d do exactly what my mom did and that his and N\u2019s behavior is ridiculous.\n\nA week later I\u2019m out to eat with my bff, my cousin and sister. Last minute dinner plans between me and my bff and we dragged the other two with us. Suddenly other cousin shows up and starts yelling at her brother and then at us for \u201cpretending to be heroes and threatening her family and calling the cops on them\u201d. I asked the wait staff to have her leave as she was causing a commotion and we didn\u2019t want to get kicked out from our meal.

I think there was over reaction on the part of your aunt and uncle as relates to your supposed threat. What you said was no more a true threat than when your aunt said that your sister was lucky she didn't see her. Sounds like the stepmom is the root of a lot of the problems going on.

As far as getting your cousin kicked from the restaurant also NTA.", "So...\n\nCousin 17 was kicked out by your uncle and his new wife (N). He's staying at your Mom's.

Uncle stood by his wife, cousin stood by his gf", "She\u2019s legally emancipated but lives with her aunt, who is aware of the situation (which is actually a WHOLE lot worse than the character count allowed me to tell). Gf has been told many times to get a restraining order but doesn\u2019t want to make things worse for my cousin. This whole ordeal is messing with him mentally and we\u2019re trying to get counseling for him", "That\u2019s where you\u2019d be wrong. I always feel like I\u2019m an unreliable narrator and when the female cousin said what she said I really thought that\u2019s exactly what was happening, that I was pretending to be a \u201chero\u201d and was really just getting involved in things that did not involve me and making the situation worse for everyone else. On one hand, I feel that without a doubt my actions were justifiable and on the other hand, I ended up getting the female cousin involved in something that should not have involved her as well as threaten someone when I could\u2019ve just let the police do their job and found out about everything later. It is a complicated situation because I want my cousin and his girlfriend to feel safe from any harm but I don\u2019t want to be actively at war with the rest of the family either.", "Seriously?

The woman is insane and your uncle is enabling it.
