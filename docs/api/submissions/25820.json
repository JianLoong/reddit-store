You were kind to offer to do it for free for her, but he never mentioned and you never agreed to your cutting your own hair off nor allowing it to be filmed. I get he's going through a hard time watching his child undergo this illness, but it's not fair to you to have gone off like this. He should have asked ahead of time if there was someone willing to cut her hair off and do their own, too. That can be a big ask for a stranger. You don't owe them your hair.", "NTA.

Offering a free service is above and beyond. Offering to cut the father's hair would have been a nice touch. Refusing the action being filmed within your business is NTA territory. Refusing to shave your own hair is also NTA territory.", "NTA he should have asked beforehand. He should shave his head for his video to collect views using his daughter.", "NTA. You were out in a crappy situation, but certainly under no obligation to shave your head on a whim because of some stranger. Even if you wanted to do it, the way he went about it was an asshole move on his part.", "NTA, obviously it\u2019s a sad situation for that family, but doesn\u2019t change the fact that the father is entitled to think people will do whatever he asks out of pity.", "NTA - The very idea that you would be roped into his little production by shaving your head with her takes entitlement to whole new level.

Tell the daughter in a loud voice that daddy will be shaving his head instead because he just loves her to pieces.  Turn it back on the AH.", "NTA. I've survived two cancers and chemotherapy.

He proceeds to call you names because it would get more views if you also shaved your head.", "NTA, the guilting and entitlement from the dad earns him a capital A!", "Brand new to reddit I see. A 21 year old barber shop owner, don't see that every day. I'm seeing red flags left and right!", "I literally don't get how someone shaving  their head helps . So many stories of family being harassed to shave in solidarity or instagram likes. \n\nThough I've seen how very young children smile when daddy shaves his head to, that's totally different as is shaving or dyeing as a fund raiser.", "Absolutely NTA. Wth was he thinking?", "NTA you really only shave your head if someone close to you gets cancer. You don't know this little girl it means nothing to her if you shave your head or not. Sad everything is about views.", "I was thinking the same thing. Why would a girl with cancer want some random hair stylist to shave their head in solidarity?", "Non-narcissists with cancer would never expect someone else to shave their head in solidarity. And many, many of them actively don't want people to do so.", "If social media didn't exist this probably never would have happened. Even if the kid actually did have cancer.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure you guys have seen the clip where an older lady with cancer goes to a barber and he \u201cspontaneously\u201d shaves his head too along with one of the other barbers.\n\n(There just happens to be a camera set up filming the whole exchange)\n\nDad is trying to ride that clout. You we him nothing and he needs to get his head out of the internet for a while.\n\nEdit, tried to find the video and there\u2019s dozens of them on YouTube.

Why would he expect something like that of a complete stranger.  He\u2019s deranged.", "NTA. The dad sounds like he is using his daughter's illness for sympathy. He's sick. You don't have to shave your head for anyone.", "NTA", "NTA. What a bizarre client, unbelievable.", "NTA. Why the need for video? Shaving one's head should be voluntary.", "I've seen the original video he was trying to recreate. It was a barber who had a kid as a frequent client and when he had treatment the barber shaved his head too. It's not something that can or should ever be forced. Shame on that dad and the poor daughter if she is actually sick.", "Nta, bet he wasn't bald. Using his daughter's deathly situation for taps", "The world is full of crazy people. Why would you ever shave your head for a kid you don't know? Why would he get crazy angry?

And film it for clout.", "Definitely NTA. Who even goes up to some random stranger and tells them \"Hey, you're going to shave your hair because I said so.\" Yeah, it's sad that the daughter has cancer - Though I'll admit I'm starting to doubt that she does based on the dad's reaction - but you don't owe them anything. You offered a free haircut for them, that should have been enough.", "Is he shaving his?", "NYA\n\nFather is just using kid for internet likes and money I guess. Who comes into a barber shop to try and make the barber shave his own head? Weeeeeird", "NTA, you are not required to shave your head for someone else's gain.

What was he thinking.", "Definitely NTA. That father makes me sick for exploit his daughter's condition for social media.  And no means no. You did the right thing.", "NTA. What a horrible thing to do, film his daughter going through this. Why is the father shaving his head in solidarity?", "N.T.A.\n\nYou are under no obligation to accept demands of anyone like that.

The father was the A.H.", "When OP said he walked up to him and whispered the plan in his ear\u2026 can\u2019t get that mental image out of my head.\n\nNasty behavior, like a random STRANGER whispering what\u2019s legit a command at this point, into OP\u2019s ear. Not a question or a request, but a command that he fully expected OP to follow through. Hair is so personal and this random man expected OP to get rid of his. This is gross.", "Right? Why didn\u2019t DAD surprise her by doing it?", "I think the real customer's story was fake", "Wrong I am sure this is real. This is how TicTok and other social media hounds work.\n\nThere is only a 50/50 chance the kid had cancer. The dad was probabaly just trying to get miney from people that watched the xideo he wanted to produce.", "The first problem is that a barber shop, by definition, is a place that cuts men\u2019s and boy\u2019s hair. This poor girl has cancer and her dad won\u2019t even take her to a proper hair salon?", "A friend of mine went through chemo during high school. Several girls offered to shave their heads in solidarity and she told them not to. One girl was very adamant about it so my friend said, \"do it if you want your head shaved but don't do if you think this is in any way about me.\" The other girl did wind up shaving her head and telling people it was to support her friend with cancer. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "Currently going through chemo.  Shaving your head is not in solidarity.  It has absolutely nothing to do with those of us with cancer.  Most of us really don't want you to do it.  It's about the person shaving their head, how it makes them feel good and being able to tell others they did it.", "If she had a cancer or not, it's safe to assume she doesn't care one bit about some random hair stylist's  hair.", "Women go to barber shops as well.
