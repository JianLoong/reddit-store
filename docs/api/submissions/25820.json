Yet they'll willingly do exactly that by donating to crowdfunding. \n\nIt's the same thing. One's just been regulated.", "Walter White had to cook meth", "Tbh, you might have to even in a country with mostly free healthcare.  Here are some of the expenses you might run into (and while not the level of medical debt in the US, they are easily enough to ruin someone, especially with increasing social inequality and the rising cost of living).  Also, this is for the average adult.  There are some programs that may provide some coverage for the extremely poor, children, or elderly; and there will be differences between provinces in terms of specific coverage and special programs (I'm in Ontario so any specific references are about Ontario).  \n\nSo here we go:\n\nAny procedure that is not performed by a medical doctor is not covered.  If you need physio therapy or anything like that, it's out of your pocket.  General mental health, dental, vision, etc. are also all not covered (unless you somehow get care inside a hospital). Many Canadians have to forgo this care due to unaffordability.\n\nAny medication not administered in a hospital setting is not covered.  This includes chemotherapy, which I recently learned can be administered at home.  Many Canadians go without necessary medications or ration them because they are not affordable.  They are only \"affordable\" relative to insane American prices.\n\nVery little home care is provided and due to shortages, it may not be available at all.  You will be discharged from the hospital anyway.  So you're going to have to figure out how to pay for a private nurse/care worker and if you can't (probable) otherwise manage wound care, IV changes, administer medication by injection, etc. (whatever you have going on).  I know this one from knowing multiple people who were discharged in a very bad state with zero support.  This wasn't always the case - I know someone who had cancer about 20 years ago and they had home care at that time.  They have cancer again and were told there was nothing.\n\nAnd this doesn't touch on the economic impact.  It's not just about paying for the procedure, it's about lost income.  Most people don't have insurance that will provide income replacement.  Employers increasingly will not provide insurance at all and getting it individually is expensive and sometimes impossible even if you can pay because of discrimination against pre-existing conditions.  Social programs for people who do lose work due to illness are wholly inadequate.  \n\nIn theory there is EI sickness or EI general if they are actually let go, but many people don't qualify.  Self-employed people don't qualify.  And there is an increasing trend of employers classfying people as independent contractors, which legally means they are \"self-employed\" and not entitled to EI.  I'm an IC, which is actually fine in my case because I'm actually treated better than I was as an employee (I had a very bad employer before) and I fully understand the nature of the relationship, but lots of people are just being exploited and have no idea of the implications. Tax time is going to be interesting, though.\n\nWhich leaves OW and ODSP (aka welfare and disability), which are well below the poverty line (for perspective, you'd be lucky to be able to pay rent with the full amount allocated for a single person on either program).  And they make it very hard to get disability, so many people get stuck on the lower amount for welfare.  In theory, there is CPP disability as well, which can give an additional amount (it's federal and concerns the pension program) but you have to have worked for many years and it depends on how much you paid into it, so if you're a young worker, you're fucked.  Oh, and you need a doctor to do lots of paperwork for all these programs, especially if you want to avoid work requirements for welfare while you are applying for disability, so better hope you have a family doctor.  A lot of people don't.\n\nWe need some serious reforms in Canada.", "My late stepfather was British. After 25 yrs in the US he was so disillusioned.

This is absolutely one of those cases.    The poster should have a right to report that ambulance company for predatory practices and have their fees written off as punishment.
