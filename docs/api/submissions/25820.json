These people are entitled and unhinged. You sure the kid actually had cancer?  It wouldn't shock me to see some turds faking something like this for Instagram clout.", "NTA. You were kind to offer to do it for free for her, but he never mentioned and you never agreed to your cutting your own hair off nor allowing it to be filmed. I get he's going through a hard time watching his child undergo this illness, but it's not fair to you to have gone off like this. He should have asked ahead of time if there was someone willing to cut her hair off and do their own, too. That can be a big ask for a stranger. You don't owe them your hair.", "NTA. Gosh - the struggles he's had in life - booking an appointment! My goodness!", "This mofo expected to walk into a random barbershop and expected to strongarm someone into shaving their head? what a prick. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nI'd love to see the look on his face if you had offered to shave *his* head instead (assuming he had hair to begin with).", "NTA. People should support each other, but not like that. Sounds super entitled", "NTA no one should feel obligated to do this", "NTA I had cancer (life was never in danger) and I cannot imagine trying to force people to shave their head for me, or modify their body in any way.", "NTA unless this is fake (really sounds like it, but Insta-assholes are far too common now). Offering a free service is above and beyond. Offering to cut the father's hair would have been a nice touch. Refusing the action being filmed within your business is NTA territory. Refusing to shave your own hair is also NTA territory.", "NTA he should have asked beforehand. He should shave his head for his video to collect views using his daughter.", "NTA. You were out in a crappy situation, but certainly under no obligation to shave your head on a whim because of some stranger. Even if you wanted to do it, the way he went about it was an asshole move on his part.", "NTA, obviously it\u2019s a sad situation for that family, but doesn\u2019t change the fact that the father is entitled to think people will do whatever he asks out of pity.", "NTA - The very idea that you would be roped into his little production by shaving your head with her takes entitlement to whole new level.  And then to get mad when you won't?  Who does this fool think he is?  You know what you should have done?  Tell the daughter in a loud voice that daddy will be shaving his head instead because he just loves her to pieces.  Turn it back on the AH.", "NTA. I've survived two cancers and chemotherapy.   I would never expect someone to shave their head.  You were very kind to offer to cut her hair for free.", "NTA. He had no right to spring that on you.", "Yeah, totally NTA.  That man is not right in the head.  You are never obligated to shave your head for strangers with cancer.  Like even friends and family, either really.  That's a lot to ask in general.  He's only doing it for tiktok views and internet clout.", "NTA. I feel really sorry for the girl, too.", "Ain\u2019t no way this is real", "nta shave your balls", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
