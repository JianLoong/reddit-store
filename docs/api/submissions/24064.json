I guess some dudes can\u2019t face facts", "NTA.  He lied, obviously and poorly.  That should raise concerns.  Really, \"he swore he was around 5\u20199 and I was probably taller than I thought\"?  That is weird -- and it doesn't have to be your weird.", "NTA, lying out of the gate is a really bad sign", "NTA, as a fellow tall woman, I understand your pain. Lying about that stuff isn't cool and you're 100% allowed to have standards for the people you date.", "NTA. That\u2019s just a sign of a much larger character flaw. Plus you can end a date for literally any reason you want. \n\nFWIW - this is one of the many reasons why I never do dinner on a first date. Drinks only; weekdays only.", "NTA. He lied and then tried to gaslight you.", "NTA. Honesty is an important quality to look for in a partner and that guy didn't have it.", "Even if you were totally fine with his height, the deception is a big deal.  It\u2019s one thing to fudge things a little (though tbh, I never liked seeing that either), but big deceptions make you wonder what else they\u2019ll be willing to lie about down the line.  It\u2019s hard to trust someone when your first impression of them is that they told you such an obvious whopper. NTA", "NTA. If he's lying about this easily refuted fact, he's going to lie about other things that aren't as benign.", "NTA\n\nOne of the first things he said to you was a lie. An easily, immediately disproven lie that he not only doubled down on, but turned into telling you that *you\u2019re* mistaken about your own height.\n\nEven if every other flag is green, it\u2019s tough to get past this one.", "If he really is 5\u20190, I\u2019d be fascinated to see what happens when he tells someone my size (5\u20191.5\u201d) that he is 5\u201910. NTA it\u2019s so stupid to lie about your height, especially when it\u2019s so extreme that anyone will notice the lie immediately. (As opposed to if someone says they\u2019re 6\u2019 but really are 5\u201910, personally I\u2019d hardly notice \u2014 they\u2019d still be plenty tall to me)((not condoning lying about height, just sayin\u2019))", "NTA. You can end a date for any reason - or no reason at all - any time you want to. You don\u2019t owe anyone your time. Even if other think the height thing is shallow, you like what you like and don\u2019t like what you dont like. But that\u2019s not the case here. He LIED. He didn\u2019t just lie in his profile, but straight to your face!!  That\u2019s a no. So while you don\u2019t owe any reason or explanation to anyone, that is a very valid reason should you choose to give one. Keep it moving and good luck finding a keeper!", "NTA. He lied", "NTA\n\nThat's a stupid thing to lie about, because his height is obvious as soon as you meet him. People who are picky about height are just going to leave, and not give him a chance. People who don't care about height might match him anyway. By telling such an obvious lie, he also loses his chance with people that care about honesty, which is probably most people.", "NTA, it seems like there\u2019s a couple of red flags are going on here, he lied and then gaslighted you when you brought it up.", "It\u2019s not the height it\u2019s the fact he lied about it. NTA.", "NTA - There's nothing wrong with shorter people but he shouldn't have lied on his profile", "NTA if he is lying about something this obvious as soon as you meet him its probably best to not date someone like that. it would probably only get worse as time goes on.", "He\u2019s the one who lied. Having a preference doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.   \n\nUnless he was 6 foot tall and you were like sorry I only date guys who are 6\u20194 which then maybe a lil asshole", "No. I can\u2019t stand men who are that insecure they have to lie and not sure how many can.", "You should\u2019ve asked him for his driver\u2019s license when he swore he was around 5\u20199. Easiest way to know he\u2019s telling the truth or lying.", "LOL. That is so weird.", "NTA. Life is too short!", "If a guy adds a couple inches on his profile, that's kinda fine IMO. However, 9 inches is a lot and that's very obvious that he's lying and secondly, the fact that he insisted on it in person is just cringe as hell. NTA.", "NTA but it\u2019s a bit of a catch-22 for him. If you\u2019re into him for his personality, he lied about something obvious and it\u2019s a turn off. If he didn\u2019t lie, you would have rejected him before you got to know him.", "Lying sucks, and it may be an unpopular opinion but people are allowed to decide what they do and don't fine attractive.\n\nSlouching is a thing tho. My friend recently casually mentioned he is 6'4\" and I called BS. I thought he was 6' even. When we stood next to each other and he actually stood up straight... Sure enough, he was. Easily 4\" taller than I'd thought. Tall men slouch tho, I've yet to meet a short man who tried to look even shorter.", "Yeah he wasn\u2019t 5\u20190.

Matched with a guy who said he was 5'11. I'm a fraction under 5'11. Cool. \n\nTurns out he was 5'5 at best. I say 'we're not quite the same height huh', he says 'I'm 5'11 but you've underestimated your height!'. Sure.

I am a solid 5\u20199, which my current boyfriend said he was too. He is short than me (not by much, but still).

Dating online is extremely tough for men, and many women will winnow the field more harshly online than they would IRL. The guy was probably hedging his bets on OP liking his personality/charm and ultimately overlooking the height. The blunt truth is that 99% of women on dating apps will reject that guy outright because of his height. If the guy is truly 5\u20190\u201d, it\u2019s hard for me to see him as the bad guy.
