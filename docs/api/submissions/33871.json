{"id": 33871, "submission_id": "18s6gq3", "title": "AITA for not wanting my neighbor\u2019s new fence on my property?", "selftext": "My(45M) next door neighbor(67F) called me last week to tell me she was having her fence replaced and asked if we (me and wife 42) would consider cutting down a large maple tree near the property line. I said sorry no, it\u2019s a healthy tree and provides a lot of shade to our back yard. However, I did have a copy of a survey I\u2019d had done three years prior for an unrelated reason that showed parts of her fence were on my property. I went over, gave her a copy and we walked the property together. She was adamant that her husband had taken great pains to erect the fence on their property 30 years prior. I have no doubt he did, but time and the elements appeared to have moved parts of it and that was normal. We seemed to part ways amicably with me suggesting she give a copy to the fence erectors.\n\nIt did not go well from there. Over a couple days it was clear through her messages that she did not believe the survey and said she thinks I know the fence is on her property. That was a Friday evening and she dropped the bomb that the fence was being installed Tuesday, the day after Xmas.\n\nI got my attorney involved and followed his advice which was to give the fence erectors a copy of the survey and tell them they didn\u2019t have permission to erect the fence on my property. They said they wouldn\u2019t and would string a line we can all look at and agree on. \n\nThey didn\u2019t do that. They began to dig post holes where the old fence was. My attorney said to tell them again not to erect the fence on your property and that the next step is to call the police and the building department. They continued to erect the fence so I called the cops and told them my neighbor was erecting a fence on my property and trespassing and that I have a survey to prove it. Police did nothing, same with the build dept, no surprise really. My attorney called the fence company owner and asked for the name of his attorney. Fence co guy says he doesn\u2019t need an attorney. My attorney spelled it out for him but they\u2019re still erecting the fence.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to do any of this. I think good fences make good neighbors. I waited till my neighbor was replacing the fence to ask her to make sure it\u2019s erected on her property. I asked her to have the crew string a line along the property line because a straight line is impossible to argue with when you\u2019re looking at it. She\u2019s refused all of these things. I don\u2019t understand what was so hard about $15 worth of string and stakes and I even offered to pay for that.\n\n*update*\nThe fence erection is complete. As more of the existing fence was demolished and they finally strung a line it was very clear the survey was accurate. What was likely once a straight line bowed over 30 years into my property and at the worst spot the old fence was ~18\u201d over the property line. They made adjustments, which my attorney says indicates they acknowledged they erected a fence on my property. Out of a ~75\u2019 length of fence there is ~20\u2019 that is ~6\u201d or so over the property line. \n\nI am in New England. A permit is required for fences over 6\u2019, this fence is 6\u2019 so no permit was required and Build Dept had no authority to stop work. \n\nMy attorney is confident my neighbor has no legit claim to adverse possession.\n", "created_utc": 1703699253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18s6gq3/aita_for_not_wanting_my_neighbors_new_fence_on_my/", "score": 656, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Pound in a few steel t-bars on the property line to mark it out. Paint the bright orange. \nHow can the Town or Police NOT step in when something illegal is going on?", "Is the fence company licensed of just some guy working out of a truck? Lodge a complaint with the state contractor's board, especially if he is unlicensed.", "The legal term in this situation is adverse possession.  Eminent domain is a taking of property by a governmental agency.", "Don\u2019t forget any punitive damages for them installing it on OP\u2019s property and causing damage to it.\n\nNTA", "u/far_mind_6528 , please read this and take action.  Otherwise, you're going to lose the land and very possibly the healthy tree.", "This is a bunch of nonsense.  Property line disputes are a private civil matter.  Excavation is regulated *far* more heavily than fences, and you can't extrapolate your experience with an excavation onto a fence dispute.\n\nOP just needs to sue.  Zoning has no bearing on this whatsoever, and I guarantee OP's municipality has no ordinances that say OP's neighbor's fence needs to be on her own property.\n\nSource: look at my username.", "Ordinances. . .I also stated there are likely ordinances involved, such as permit requirements.\n\nIn my borough permits are required for fences and all accessory structures, there are also ordinances regarding fence height, material type, whether or not they can be directly on the property line, etc.  And anything requiring a permit is subject to inspection by the appropriate personnel.\n\nIf any of those types of ordinances exist in OPs locality, they can sue their borough/municipality/whatever for not enforcing their own laws.", "There's an update on the OP that you probably want to read, since you're so sure there are permitting requirements in play and OP can sue over them.  Spoiler: you're completely wrong, again."]}
