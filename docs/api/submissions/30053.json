Or why not surprise everyone with baby pictures when your angel is born without any build up. \n\nAs your mother (sorry) is the AH here I would be inclined to start telling \u201cfalse truths\u201d to her.

You think the nagging is bad now? Mmmm.... Really, you need to shut her down now. She'll pitch a bunch of guilt trip fits, but that's her problem, not yours.\n\n\"No, mom.\" Hang up.

It sucks, but setting boundaries with toxic family rarely has a break time even when we deserve it the most.  It might be time to lower contact with mom and just concentrate on you for a while."]}
