I had heard the concert is pretty long, so I started looking for something to do to pass the time while they were there.  I decided on going to a minor league baseball game and after running it by my wife, she thought it was a great idea, so I got a ticket.  Today while at work, I saw where there were two empty seats next to where my seat was and thought it would be great to invite my buddy that lives two hours away (opposite direction from where I'm coming from) to the game.  I texted him and he said he would love to go but would also want to bring his 9 year old daughter.  I told him that sounded great, so they went ahead and got the two remaining seats that were beside me.  Fast forward to tonight.  I'm watching TV and casually tell my wife that I was excited because I invited my friend to meet me at the game.  She became FURIOUS telling me that it was incredibly selfish of me to not notify her first that I wanted to invite him or ask her what she thought about it.\n\nShe is still very angry and texted her friends who have all said I was out of line for not talking to her about it first.\n\nI honestly didn't think I needed to talk to her about that before inviting my friend to drive in for the game, and it has me very upset that she thinks I'm an inconsiderate asshole for not asking her about it.

What kind of impact does she think there is by having them at the game with you?", "NTA but your wife sure is", "I feel like there is something missing here. No one gets upset about someone tagging along to a game.", "You have to ask her permission to go to a ballgame with your friend?  What kind of ridiculous bs is this?  Does she limit the number of shits you take in a week?  Are you allowed to comb your hair to the left or does she decide the direction of your part?  How about coffee?  Does she dictate how you take your morning coffee?  She, and any friend that agrees with her, is unhinged to be even slightly put off that you arranged this.  She is a giant, controlling, self-important asshole.  You?  Solid NTA.  I'm assuming you only ran it by her so she would know where you were in case something happened at the concert or to you.  Not telling her you invited a friend has absolutely no bearing on her, your daughter, or anything having to do with the trip.  You told her about your friend coming a month out!  I would be furious at her reaction.", "She\u2019s not going to the game with you and your friends are not riding with you so I don\u2019t see her problem. It\u2019s frankly not her business to where she needs to be consulted. Sounds controlling to me. NTA.", "NTA if this is the full story. Your friend is bringing his young daughter. Not like you two will go out partying. Even if your wife doesn't like this friend it is not like she will see him. This doesn't make any sense. I would be happy my husband was going to do something fun with a friend.", "NTA! What a weird reaction. He even bought his own ticket and that of his daughter. What does any of this have to do with your wife? She and your daughter are going to be at a concert anyway. Just\u2026so bizarre", "NTA. How perfect that it worked out for your friend and his daughter to join you so you don\u2019t have to enjoy the game alone! I don\u2019t understand why your wife wouldn\u2019t also be happy for you. It\u2019s not like you paid for the tickets for 2 other people or would have an extra passenger with your wife & daughter on the ride there or would be attending with a single woman. I just don\u2019t understand her fury over this.", "Did their seats come out of your budget? Not sure why she is insisting on knowing first, otherwise. **NTA.**", "NTA this sounds like very concerning controlling behavior. She doesn\u2019t have any right to control who you go to a baseball game with. It\u2019s really perplexing that she would react like that over you bringing a friend and his daughter. There has to be something else going on here that\u2019s crazy. NTA at all", "NTA at all", "Why does she care, she\u2019s gonna be busy NTA", "NTA.  Does she ask you for permission to hang out with friends? Are you expected to check in whenever you hang out?  It just seems like a huge overreaction to you having a friend drive out to meet you at a ball game.  Is something else going on?  This makes no sense for her to be so up in arms about it.", "ThT is crazy that she is mad that you i invited  a friend to go to the game with you.  I mean the only reason you are going to the game is to kill time while you wait on your wife and daughter .  Your wife has a control problem.", "Your wife is kind of sounding like the AH. Is there a reason she doesn't want you to see this friend?   It seems rather irrational the amount of anger brought on by arranging to me a friend that's 4 hours away.   It's not like you see them all the time", "NTA, but the story seems like its missing something here.\n\nThe wife isn't even going to be at this game and you aren't paying for the friend's tickets. Normally people don't get bent out of shape over that. Is there something about this particular friend that your wife does not like? Or is there something else going on with her right now and she took it out on you over this?", "NTA. Your wife said you going to the game was a great idea. End of story.", "INFO:  Do you know why she was so upset?  Does she not like the friend?", "NTA- your wife sounds controlling as hell and is the AH. She is going out too a concert and you going out as well shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. It\u2019s different if you were going out and leaving her to provide child care and this was a regular occurrence of her providing care for your child and not having a night for herself. But this situation is not that and she needs to stop being so controlling. She\u2019s the AH not you", "She's not going to like the responses on here- definitely NTA.", "NTA. Her reaction is unwarranted and way over-the-top. If my family were in the same situation I would feel kinda bad that my husband was going to the game alone, so if he said \u201chey I invited Friend to join me\u201d I\u2019d be happy.", "NTA. Your wife is being absurdly controlling.  Major AH.  What difference does it make to her, at all?", "NTA and I have absolutely no idea why she would be angry about this.", "NTA, and I really hope your wife is reading all these comments. I would understand her annoyance if she were going to the baseball game with you\u2026 but she is going to be preoccupied at a concert. You are being a SAINT of a husband for driving them. And you\u2019re expected to\u2026 watch a baseball game by yourself? and she gets mad that you invited a friend, without asking? I truly am trying, but I really don\u2019t understand the logic. It doesn\u2019t affect her in the least. If anything, she should be so happy for you to have found a fun activity to pass the time with a friend who you likely don\u2019t see often since they live so far away. She sounds unreasonable and controlling and I hope these comments gives her some insight into how ridiculous being upset over this is.", "She is NOT right. Wth? She's not your keeper and you're not a child. It's not like you invited a random woman. You invited your friend and he's bringing his kid. Nothing weird about that since you informed her prior to the event. You are NTA.\n\nETA : unless she has a problem with him for some reason and you were aware of it.", "NTA. And tell your wife for us that it was unanimous: she's TA in this situation. Can she say \"backfired\"?", "NTA. I kind of get the impression she really liked that you were acting as their personal chauffeur to see the hottest concert this decade - this night was ALL ABOUT THEM and they were DOING IT RIGHT.\n\nNow that you have your own plans with a friend, it takes some of the shine off it\u2026 not that it actually impacts their plans. \n\nSelfish on your wife\u2019s part to care, just saying that\u2019s the only vibe I can catch here.", "NTA please have your wife explain how she's supposed to be in both places at the same time! Lol She already had plans, but apparently expects you to just sit in the car all night?", "Your wife is wrong and she\u2019s acting dramatic for no reason. NTA", "NTA \n\nThe way this is written your wife sounds super controlling and to be honest she sounds jealous of your friendship with this person. But on the other side of this\u2026.\n\nDid your wife invite you to the concert with your daughter? And you declined? And then made plans to do something you enjoy with someone else and their daughter? Because then she could feel like you don\u2019t want to hang out with your own kid and sharing their interests unless it\u2019s something you feel like doing. \n\nNot saying this is what happened. Just trying to see where all the hostility on her end is coming from.", "NTA\u2026 would it have been nicer for you to mention it? Yes. Does not mentioning it make you an asshole and cause the reaction you\u2019re describing? No.", "*Huge* NTA, in fact she very much is one in this situation.  I hope she reads these comments too. \n\nI\u2019m trying to put myself in her shoes and figure out why she would be mad and I just\u2026 can\u2019t. If your friend was an ex-girlfriend or even just a girl that she may be insecure about, I could understand. But it sounded like your friend is a guy?\n\nShe sounds extremely controlling and she is the one out of line.", "Her reaction reads quite a bit extreme to me. Why is she not happy you\u2019ve found a nice way of spending what would essentially be a waste of time for you and get to see a friend you presumably don\u2019t spend a lot of time with otherwise? NTA.", "I can see some minor irritation. But not get mad. Not like you paid for their tickets etc without discussing it. She should be glad that you will have some company while you wait. I agreed with going to one of my sisters soon so we can see another sister we haven\u2019t seen in a long time. Her daughter is bringing her. And I told my husband after I made plans to go. You made plans. And later let her know. I would be furious if he told me I was selfish and thoughtless not discussing it with him first before I put the date in my phone. NTA.", "NTA as written. However, I\u2019m kinda curious to hear wife\u2019s point of view. OP says she\u2019s truly mad because he didn\u2019t check with her first, and I would understand her anger if OP has a history of making decisions without consulting her.\n\nOn the scale of decisions that impact others, this seems pretty benign, and her reaction seems over-the-top. However, if this is the straw that has enraged her, then OP may be TA. \n\nIs there history of bad behavior with this friend? Does she have a reason to be irritated with you because you consistently make decisions without consulting her? Or, is it possible she had something else in mind and didn\u2019t tell OP about it? \n\nI\u2019m only hem-hawing because OP has described his wife\u2019s reaction and it seems so dramatic! Usually when a person has a reaction that is overly dramatic, there are other things under the surface that have been simmering for a while.", "Is this the latest in a series of posts where we find out that there is actually a romantic relationship between this guy and friend?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019d understand her being upset if the time with the friend cut into other plans, if you bought the ticket, if you had a history of bad behavior or decisions with this friend, if the friend was going by your house after, or if it otherwise inconvenienced your family. But none of this seems to be the case. Her  worries about a lot of drinking also seem to be unfounded.  \n\nI am curious her side because the fact that her friends side with her here seems outright weird to me, too. \n\nShe sounds really controlling and unreasonable here. There was no practical reason for you to run it by her first, and you shouldn\u2019t need permission to hang out with a friend during a time she\u2019s not around anyway and your only responsibility is to occupy yourself for a few hours while she\u2019s at a concert.", "NTA\n\nYou already spoke to her about the game, why do you need to run past her who you sit with prior to making arrangements. I don't think it's disrespect in the slightest. \n\nHer friend must also have a problem with drinking if she assumes that a father will automatically put his family at risk because he is going to a game.

She was fine with me driving 4 hours away and staying with him for 2 nights in October and has offered up our home to invite him over before to hang out, but she repeatedly kept mentioning I... \"cared more about my girlfriend (him) than I care about my own wife\" for not telling her.  There could be some jealousy there, but I don't want to speak for her.", "She didn't have a problem with me driving 4 hours this past October to stay with him and his family for 2 nights, so I can't imagine she has a big problem with him.", "We knew from the beginning when we were trying to secure tickets that I wouldn't be going to the concert; they were just far too expensive for me to justify getting 3 tickets.  I'm also not particularly a big fan of Taylor Swift, while on the other hand, my wife and daughter are super fans.  This concert, I believe, is just a mother/daughter thing that they wanted more than anything.\n\nThe idea of inviting my friend to the ballgame never crossed my mind until today, nearly a week after I bought my ticket.  Even then, I figured it would be a long shot for my friend to actually go to the game since he lives 2-3 hours away.  When he told me he would like to go and bring his daughter there was nothing inside me that this was a red flag that was going to upset my wife and make her be so angry at me...that's why I told her about it tonight.  If I kept things from my wife and was a dishonest husband, I could have easily just gone to the game and met my buddy there and she would be none-the-wiser and no feelings would have been hurt, but I'm always honest with her.", "She's angry because I didn't talk to her about inviting him first.", "Why should she be even a little irritated?", "But why would you need to run it by her? I feel like that\u2019s the part no one gets? Why? Has she articulated why she believes you should have done so?

Just to add I am a woman.", "Feeling like the last to know. Not saying it\u2019s ideal to be such. He didn\u2019t disrespect her. Likely some time passed between his plans and actually saying something. No grounds to be irritated bc he didn\u2019t get her approval. But I am assuming it\u2019s more about waiting to even say something. Likely took her by surprise. Her friends and her I think are just grasping at straws to find fault on him. I doubt they worry he will get zonked and can\u2019t go pick her up.", "She said she runs everything by me as a matter of respect and that it was very disrespectful to her that I didn't run that by her.", "We definitely have partied quite a bit in our days.

It didn\u2019t involve or affect her or the time of our arrival so we didn\u2019t tell her, but she felt really excluded to not be notified.  \n\nAnyway, we\u2019re not friends anymore in great part to this part of her personality.  Not this one instance, but it happened a lot.  She tried to dictate who we all could and could not be friends with, which was the final straw.  She was extremely controlling.
