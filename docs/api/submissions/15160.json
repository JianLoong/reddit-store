Less sleep doesn\u2019t always equate to more tired. I get way more sleep than my partner and I still deal with exhaustion while he is fine. We just have different bodies.", "NTA - Is your friend really gatekeeping being tired. Personally I could have slept for 12 hours and I'd sometimes feel like I got 2 at most. Everybody reacts differently depending on their quality of sleep", "NTA. If you had only slept for an hour your friend would say they slept for half an hour. Some people always have to have it harder than everyone else. \n\nAlso people react differently to not getting enough sleep. I can sleep for 4 hours a night for a long time and be fine. My wife needs her 8 hours or her whole day is chaos.", "NTA. If I were you, I\u2019d have no room in my life for people who told me I had no right to how I felt, and even went out of their way to try to argue me out of feeling how I felt. Ridiculous. You don\u2019t need someone this bananas in your life.", "NTA - its not a contest, your both tired.", "NTA. Your friend overreacted. Yes she's tired, which is understandable, but just cause she might feel like crap, doesn't mean she can take it out on others.", "NTA it sounds like you were both tired and probably a little grumpy because of it. I hope you get over being sick soon and have a chance to catch up on some sleep too.", "Nta. Its not a competition yet she tried to make it one.", "NTA! Fuck off with gatekeeping whose more tired.", "ESH. You were both tired and should have probably gone to get some sleep instead of arguing.", "Soft esh I think it\u2019s really not that big of a deal for your friend to keep going on about it but I also don\u2019t thinks its that big of a deal for them to share there sleep schedule. But I also this she is being a bit of an ahole by saying you have no right to be tired like I barely ever sleep and my friends get tired really quickly but I don\u2019t tell them that they shouldn\u2019t complain", "You both were.  You both needed sleep and weren't acting very nicely. All tact went out the window for you both.  You are entitled to be tired.  Maybe if you talk now, realize how silly it is to hang onto this, and just agree to put it behind you and move forward with your friendship.  Is this worth losing a friend?  If you said yes, take a nap and try again.  If you still feel the same way, then there are probably other issues in play here.", "Honestly? Wait till you have more than a petty squabble and re-post.\n\nWait... the next post up asks if some other asshole is an asshole for taking the last beer. So yours is actually more substantial. But seriously! Bigger fight. Please.", "Nta. Ya both needed sleep.\nHell my fiance works 5am-4pm and still does stuff til 9. He needs his sleep. \nMe, i used to work graveyard for years. I am solid on 4hrs all day but if I make it to 6hrs imma need 10. Different biology, REM cycles, routines, needs. All that.\n\nBig fan of naps here, now my fiance takes a 30min on his lunch lol. Sleep is a valuable resource not a hill to die on.\n\nEdit: instead of arguing just agree ya both should just take a nap!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
