My mom rolled her eyes and told me to turn it off, but I didn\u2019t and decided why not just put my AirPods on. But she yelled \u201cNo, turn off the music!\u201d\n\nSo I said \u201cyou won\u2019t hear it if I have my AirPods in\u201d she got upset and took my phone saying \n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you listen to them Chinese people anyway, you don\u2019t know what their saying and you won\u2019t ever get noticed by them\u201d \nShe said she was tired of me spending my money on albums and making plans to go to concerts. One day she even ripped one of my posters off the wall because she felt one of the members had too much make up on. You know how crazy that is??? \n\nSo I told her that whatever I listened to SHOULDNT concern her. Because it\u2019s just music\u2014- pop music in another language and it\u2019s not like I was trying to become an idol\u2026or even fake to be Korean.

I told her she\u2019s lucky I\u2019m not roaming around the streets with vapes and having sexual interactions with other people. \n\nShe called kpop useless and I was grounded for three days. \n\nIt made me upset and it was hard communicating with her. But I ofc had no other choice but to. When I got my phone back, I saw that my K-pop playlist was gone. \nI asked her why she did it and she said she was sick and tired of having a black child wanting to be another ethnicity. \n\nI told her she was stressing me out and I couldn\u2019t wait to move out because I was tired of having someone as judgmental as her of a mother. \nam I in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1703964772, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18unlow/aita_for_telling_my_mom_shes_the_reason_im_in_the/", "score": 340, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I eventually figured out that my family was just really invested in \u201cnormal\u201d and super self conscious about anything that might stand out in a bad way. I took Japanese as my language in college, used it to further my majors where it was directly relevant and even after they fought me tooth and nail to not study abroad, I outlasted them and they\u2019ve bragged about it ever since. My biggest lesson - I regret every time I gave something up because it bothered my family that it wasn\u2019t what everyone else did. I regret it so much! And the ones where I had the courage to keep going? They added so much to my life in terms of people, experiences, and self confidence.
