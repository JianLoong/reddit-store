{"id": 17475, "submission_id": "13k5z58", "title": "AITA - Cancelled Couch Order after Daughter Snubbed Me on Mothers Day", "selftext": "My daughter (20) just bought her first home with her boyfriend and is very eager to make it perfect and completely renovate as quickly as possible.\r  \nShe wanted to redo her kitchen cabinets, so I offered to 'help' her paint them. My husband and I have also gifted her two 55\" TV's. On top of those things, last Friday, while I was at her house painting her cabinets, new appliances were delivered for which she did not pay to have hooked up. I didn't want her to be without appliances any longer so I went ahead and paid $150 for the guys to install the gas stove as well as the dishwasher. That same day, I took her to a furniture store and placed an order for a $1,000 couch, which was supposed to be delivered tomorrow. While we were furniture shopping she asked me what I was doing for Mother's Day (I have two very young children (4 years & 8 months)) and am now married - I was very young when I had her and was never married to her father). I told her \"nothing\" and that was the end of the conversation. As a side note, that's exactly what we did - no elaborate plan or anything! I stayed home with my little ones and my husband, we ordered takeout and had it delivered and enjoyed the day together as a family.\r  \nOn Mother's Day, I didn't get a \"Happy Mother's Day\" text until 11:25 a.m. In that text she said she \"had a little something for me\" and would drop it off later. About two hours later she texted me and said \"we'll be there in 15 minutes.\" When she arrived, she told me that her boyfriend had recently cleaned out the car and apparently took the gift out of the car and she didn't realize until they pulled into the driveway. She also mentioned that they were just on their way home from picking up a friend from the airport. So, the friend, and her boyfriend were waiting in the car. My house is between the airport and her house so it is clear that I was just a \"stop\" along the way. Anyway, while she was there, she used the bathroom, chit chatted for less than five minutes and left.\r  \nI'm frustrated, sad, and very much hurt for a couple of reasons:\r  \nI don't feel I needed to have a plan in place for my daughter to feel like she should spend Mother's Day with her mother.\r  \nI don't believe that she did have a \"gift.\" The car was just purchased (brand new) four days prior so I'm not sure what exactly in it needed to be \"cleaned.\"\r  \nDespite not having a gift, I'm let down by the fact that she couldn't have stayed for lunch or planned on coming back for dinner.\r  \nI'm extremely taken aback by the fact that my husband and I have gifted her and her boyfriend those TV's, painted their kitchen cabinets, paid for their appliance installation, and ended up spending $1,250 after tax and delivery for a couch.\r  \nAfter explaining all of this to her, all she is is defensive and blames me for telling her that we weren't doing anything. Completely ignores all my other disappointments.\r  \nWell, I went ahead and cancelled the couch order and will get my $1,250 back.

Would you return the couch then because it wasn\u2019t in par with the money you have spent?   \n\nYou are a martyr parent. Sure you can cancel the couch but doing so because your daughter didn\u2019t make a mountain out of a Hallmark holiday while she has guests and her own house to renovate?  Yeah, YTA.", "She called you. She saw you. They may or may not have had a gift. idk She's setting up a new house and has a lot going in. Also you keep counting money and that's gross.

That means they would need to remove the things they were moving out of the car to make room for the friend and luggage!", "YTA. Don't give gifts with strings, you will always be disappointed. If you want her to come for lunch or dinner, invite her. She called you, she stopped by to see you, she at least thought enough to lie about having a gift but more realistically did get you a gift. You're not the center of her world, and that's something you need to deal with on your own before you push your daughter away for good.", "YTA. You are taking back a gift on the basis that she didn\u2019t read your mind.  I can\u2019t believe that you have a 20 year but haven\u2019t matured yet.", "Yta u sound exhausting and entitled", "YTA.  If the couch and TVs were gifts the should be given without conditions attached; if they were not gifts the conditions should have been explained beforehand.  Your 20 year old daughter is starting her adult life with her partner, sending you a text and calling to your house to wish you happy mother's Day is perfectly fine, calling en-route from the airport is a  sensible use of time and fuel.\n\nHad you asked her to lunch or dinner?  Does she normally spend mother's Day with you?  Are you normally petty when people disappoint you?  How has she treated you like dirt and disrespected you?", "YTA - Your adult daughter, who has a life outside of you, remembered to text you happy Mother's Day AND stopped by for a visit. A large number of mothers would have been over the moon for something like that. Be grateful.", "YTA. She asked your plans - you didn\u2019t tell her \u201chaving a quiet day with the kiddos, come over and hang!\u201d You told her you were doing nothing. She texted you still in the morning - as a woman in my early 20s, I\u2019m not up and speaking with people until around then on Sundays. She got you a gift, which she forgot - which is a fumble, for sure, but it happens, especially since she\u2019s helping out the friend that morning with the ride from the airport. She stops by to see you, and moves on, and again, you didn\u2019t really invite her. You were under no obligation to get her a couch, you chose to. And then you decided to be a brat because the effort she put forth for you wasn\u2019t good enough. What did your little kids do? Would you get mad at them because it didn\u2019t meet your expectations? You\u2019re on a fast track to not having a relationship with your adult child based on how you handled this.", "YTA. You're making your relationship transactional. You're under no obligation to help your daughter, but if you do it shouldn't come with strings attached. That's really petty and messed up that your help is so easily rescinded.\n\nAs for mother's day, if you wanted her to hang out with you then you should've told her you were going to have take out as a family and it would be great if she was there. Instead you said you weren't doing anything. You have small children so it's understandable to do nothing and maybe she was respecting that. You're also accusing her of lying about a gift for no reason. I just bought a new car and we cleaned it a few days later BECAUSE it's new. I finally took off all the plastic protective film and want to keep it looking new so I'm more diligent than with my old car.\n\nPutting this much pressure on commercialized holidays is pointless. Is she a generally good daughter and do you have a good relationship? Why are you ruining that based on some silly made up day invented for merchants to make money?", "It feels like there\u2019s some information missing here - you have a second family with young children; what does your daughter feel about this whole situation? Do you think she feels second class and that\u2019s why she\u2019d never expect you\u2019d want to spend your Mother\u2019s Day with her instead of your husband and 2 young children? How\u2019s her relationship with your 2nd family?", "YTA. Are you serious?! \n\n- She wished you happy mothers day (probably when she woke up or shortly after - I was rarely up before 10 on a Sunday when I was 20). \n- She had a gift you have no reason to believe she didn't other than your own suspicions. Her BF cleaning out the car seems very reasonable. Even if it is new they are renovating a house, you use a car a lot for that.\n\nYou are being petty because you didn't ask for what you wanted and are expecting her (a very busy young adult) to read your mind. She ASKED you what you were doing and gave you the opportunity to say \"I would love if you just came over to hang out\" or something like that. You said nothing! No I would like to X. No just a chill day at home would you like to come over for dinner. Nothing - she has no reason to believe that you wanted anything more. She even saw you on Sunday! You didn't have to be a \"stop\" all you had to do was ask. I literally have no idea what you are complaining about other than your inability to communicate your needs. \n\nShe was defensive because she did ask, text you, visit, and get you a gift. I would be defensive too. \n\nYou and your husband CHOSE to GIFT her those things. Gifts are not transactions.", "YTA, a gift with strings isn\u2019t a gift, it\u2019s a manipulation tactic. You gave no indication of wanting to do anything and then were surprised to not do anything. Also, 11 isn\u2019t even that late.", "I thought this was going in a different direction until I got to the part about 11:25 am and it snowballed from there!\n\nAnd you cancelled her couch without even sharing your feelings with her?  \n\nI\u2019d say how kind of you to help her out and gift her these items for her new house but obviously there are strings attached.  What excuse are you going to give her when the couch is never delivered? Honesty? \n\nYTA 100% I don\u2019t care if she was making the \u201cgift\u201d up or not you sound like a bigger headache than helpful or kind or giving or loving.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "YTA and entitled as fuck for doing something millions of women did before you", "Holy shit YTA and my god you sound fucking  exhausting. \n\n>\tso I offered to \u2018help\u2019 her paint them. My husband and I have also gifted her two 55\u201d TV\u2019s\u2026.\n\nA gift comes with NO strings. You CHOSE to do those things, along with the appliances and sofa. You don\u2019t get to hold that over anyone\u2019s head. \n\n>\tWhile we were furniture shopping she asked me what I was doing for Mother\u2019s Day (I have two very young children (4 years & 8 months)) and am now married - I was very young when I had her and was never married to her father).

Be fucking happy you got anything. \n\n>\t In that text she said she \u201chad a little something for me\u201d and would drop it off later. \n\nSo, not only did she text you happy Mother\u2019s Day (I know, how dare she do that at 11:25am the outrage), she also got you a little gift. \n\n\n>\tI don\u2019t believe that she did have a \u201cgift.\u201d\n\nWhy?  Why the fuck do you think she is lying?  I mean, I can totally see WHY she wouldn\u2019t get you a gift at all, but what exactly makes you think it\u2019s a lie?  It sure seems like a hell of a lot of work to lie about that AND stop by. \n\n>\tDespite not having a gift, I\u2019m let down by the fact that she couldn\u2019t have stayed for lunch or planned on coming back for dinner\n\nAgain, did you ask her, or make any statement about maybe enjoying having her there with the shiny new family? \n\n\n>\tI don\u2019t feel I needed to have a plan in place for my daughter to feel like she should spend Mother\u2019s Day with\n\nBased on the tone of this post I wouldn\u2019t want to be around you either.

You made no mentions of lunch or dinner to her. She can\u2019t read your mind. If you wanted her there for either, you should have used your big girl words.\n\nEdit: lots of typos", "YTA, your being petty. You told her you weren\u2019t doing anything.", "The two of you communicate poorly and you didn't make your expectations or hopes clear that she would come to your home on Mother's Day and spend time there. You told her you weren't doing anything and you told us you just had a chill day at home with takeout. Nowhere do you suggest that your daughter should just know she's to spend the day at your house or you'll get mad.\n\nIt sounds like both of you are making assumptions. You are assuming she'll know to be at your house will bells on first thing in the morning to spend the day, and she's assuming that you have no plans and would like to just have a quiet day. She did text you in the morning (but apparently not early enough) and she stopped by on the way from the airport but realized she didn't have the gift. Totally possible there was a gift and the husband emptied the car out if they were picking someone up from the airport. \n\nYTA for returning the couch. When you helped your child with her new home and ordered the couch for you, there was no agreement that she couldn't have the couch anymore if she upset you. It was a gift. I see nothing in your post suggesting that the gift is contingent on mom's feelings.", "Your love is contingent on what you get in return. \nYou could have a conversation like an adult with her but instead you acted like a child.

If you wanted to spend some time with her that day you could've literally said, \"for mother's day, I'd like to spend some quality time with you\".

Does your daughter make a habit of lying to you?", "Saying she didn't text you until 11am as if she waited soooo long is kinda silly. Weird of you to put it that way. Sunday was mothers day. Most people without children sleep in on the weekend. Texting Happy MD at 11am is hardly like she let the whole day pass without saying anything. \n\nYTA for cancelling a gift. Its like your trying to buy her love.

It\u2019s either a gift or conditions, it\u2019s not both. Did she ask for any of these gifts? There are some real weird undertones to your post, I think you are glossing over some info.

YOU said there was nothing special planned for the day nor does her life revolve around you. shouldn't common sense tell you since she stopped by she meant to give you a gift. why would she stay for lunch or dinner when you never informed her you wanted that from her. she cannot win with you.", "I\u2019m not sure about all of this but leaning NTA. I\u2019m shocked by all the YTA comments because, though the tv\u2019s are already a given gift she should NOT take away, the couch is not. In the US at least, it\u2019s extremely difficult to but a home and car, and I would be grateful for help furnishing the house. At the very least I think that warrants spending a meal with your mother (mother\u2019s day or not). If I supported my daughter in that way and she ignored me on Mother\u2019s Day, I\u2019d probably cancel an order for a $1k couch too.

That on its own makes YTA, but to then rescind a gift like that just to punish her for not leaving her friend and partner is not ok.", "YTA be specific if you expect something specific", "Sounds like payback\u2014not a good strategy if you want a healthy long-term relationship with your problematic daughter.", "YTA and very petty.

Did you tell her that you have very specific requirements about when she contacts you on Mother\u2019s Day? Did you invite her husband and her friend in, so they could all stay longer? Did you ask her to stay for lunch or come over for dinner? \n\nI\u2019m guessing the answer to all of these questions is no. You didn\u2019t communicate. And while it would be great if your daughter just naturally wanted to be with you all day on Mother\u2019s Day, you have a blended family now\u2014the expectations are fuzzier and more complicated.

You're being overly dramatic here. Your daughter just moved into a new home and is doing lots of renovating. She has a lot going on and can't always be around to spend time with you. This is something you will need to get used to, especially when - \n\nShe asked you what to do for Mother's Day and you said, and I quote, \"NOTHING\".  I don't know about you but if someone tells me they don't want anything, I assume they don't want anything, and won't get all huffy if I don't do anything.\n\nYou say you don't believe she actually had a gift for you. I think if she didn't have one, she probably would have just went with the perfectly valid \"you told me not to get you anything\" defense rather than promising to bring a gift she knew she didn't have. \n\nNext time, don't do the guessing game, if you want her to hang out on Mother's Day, tell her that instead of expecting her to come around anyway when she has a lot on her plate AND you told her you weren't expecting anything.

It\u2019s not \u201clabor\u201d to invite someone over\n\nMoving is insanely hectic and stressful as is, let alone around a holidays, so when OP said \u201cnothing\u201d her daughter \u201cmatched the vibe\u201d so to speak and didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it.", "Correct. It is not reasonable for anyone, whether they be male or female, to be vindictive purely because they have unrealistic expectations about a situation. \n\nYou realize flippant comments like yours just gives ammunition to actual misogynists, right?\n\nIf you can't approach something with critical thought, you're only doing harm to the very cause you're professing to champion.", ">If you care about someone, you ask them if they want to do anything or plan something for them.\n\nshe did and her mom said NOTHING so her daughter like a normal person went on with her life. got her mom a gift and wished her a happy holiday end of story. her daughter did do something for her. y'all are disgusting ppl", "The daughter asked if the mom was doing anything. The mom said no. \n\nThat\u2019s not the same as asking \u201cdo you want to do something\u201d.\n\nThe appropriate response to \u201cnothing\u201d would be \u201cwould you like to plan something with me then?\u201d", "She asked what her mother was doing, not what she wanted to do.", "And regardless of tone it is up to the mother to communicate like an adult and not expect her daughter to analyze every word her mother says. \u201cOh nothing, I would love to see you and your boyfriend though!\u201d Or \u201cNothing! I can\u2019t wait to be lazy all day, but you and boyfriend are welcome to join the family\u201d \n\nIt really isn\u2019t that hard, this mom is an AH regardless of her \u201ctone\u201d", "Your argument is that OP shouldn't bother checking if her mom wants to do anything for mother's day, even just stopping by her home for dinner, because she needs to take care of a 4 year old?\n\nEven 4 year olds know to make their mom a macaroni necklace and card. \n\nThere are plenty of things they could've with the kids or on their own, or OP could've just stopped over for lunch or dinner which is all the mom wanted anyway.", "Or the mom is an adult and is perfectly capable of asking for what they want.", "Oh, agreed, OP YTA.\n\nI just meant for all of us analyzing from our screens, we're missing the context to really be able to way what kind of \"nothing\" OP meant.", "1. OP is mom not the kid\n2. She did ask! Idk where you are losing this thread. She asked. Mom said nothing and didn't follow it up. Kid acted accordingly. The daughter did acknowledge the day. OP had several openings to express her wants and needs and she chose to be passive aggressive and bitter."]}
