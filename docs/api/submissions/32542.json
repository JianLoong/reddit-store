I had a baby 8 weeks ago. My husband's friends girlfriend (Cindy) had a baby 3 days ago and had complications and was rushed to the OR for a full hysterectomy. She was just discharged yesterday. His buddy is deployed, so he is not home. She lives right next door to us.\n\nMy husband got a hold of me around noon and said his buddy had asked him if I would be willing to cook a big meal for Cindy and 3 of their kids because she's in a lot of pain and is having troubles mentally and physically. They have 6 kids together, including the newborn, but 3 of them are currently with their mother (his friends kids- but Cindy's bio kids are home- not old enough to cook- oldest is 7). I said no, I would not be willing to do that. He pressed the issue and said \"you can't just make chop suey or something easy? I know it's not your job or even your problem but it would be nice of you and she would probably appreciate it. Plus, it would give you time to bond with her and get a new friend.\" I again said no. I have zero interest in being friends (she's a judgemental woman) and I'm exhausted with my own infant. I told him she should have her mom, who visits frequently, cook her meals or one of her own friends but I'm not doing it. My husband stopped pushing the issue but he just came home earlier from work and started cooking for Cindy and her kids. I asked why he was doing that and he said \"because you refuse and my buddy asked me to. If I were deployed and needed help, he would make sure it was handled.\" And is basically giving me the cold shoulder because I wouldn't do this for him.\n\nETA: a lot of people have mentioned to just order them food. We don't have enough money to order a bunch of take out and this is food we bought on our dollar. That and he said that his buddy asked us to \"make enough food for leftovers\" so Cindy didn't have to worry about where the next meal would come from. So my husband went out and bought 6lbs of elbow macaroni and 4lbs of hamburger and made enough chop suey to last them 3-4 days. So to even cook for them I also would have had to drive 30 minutes to the store to grab anything. My husband and I are NOT military!!! His friend is. He is deployed. Cindy is just his girlfriend, who happens to live next door to us. We are not in a military community. I am not a military wife.

If you guys live in a military-heavy community (I'm guessing not on base, since Cindy isn't married to your husband's friend but still has housing) this type of stuff comes up, and it often means dealing with some people you don't want to deal with, because of the intertwined nature of military careers and lives.\n\nThat's just about the interaction with Cindy, though. It's worth asking yourself if some of the frustration is because your husband is doing more for your neighbor, at his friend's request, than he's doing for you, his wife. If that's the case, that's a much bigger issue that needs to be addressed, because it's not fair for you to be the only one dealing with the domestic tasks with a newborn.\n\n~~Also, just came home from work?

I cannot imagine going through that 3 days ago and then having to come home and care for 4 kids including a newborn alone. \n\nYeah, ok, I get you\u2019re also tired but man\u2026 I am glad your husband stepped up. He probably should have just done it to begin with instead of pressuring you after you said no.", "NAH he\u2019s right tho, his buddy would help you if you needed; just sorta how being a military family goes. You don\u2019t have to like her or be friends to understand how difficult it is to have your SO gone or the situation she\u2019s in. You don\u2019t need to make friends to drop off food either. \n\nBut you have an 8 week old which makes you unable to help her imo.", "NTA - it starts with one meal and next thing you know it's laundry and cleaning and more meals.  You just had a baby and have your hands full.  A simple \"no\" should have sufficed.", "NAH. You have a small baby yourself and no energy to deal with the mental load to care for that woman. However, you husband is also acting right here - he asked you and after hearing your arguments he is taking the responsibility to do the task that he promised to his friend himself.", "NTA. You have enough on your plate at the moment. Your husband must be delusional to suggest you drag your sore, exhausted postpartum self over to a neighbors house to cook and clean for her. The nerve of him!", "I\u2019m going with Esh. I understand you are also dealing with post partum, but I had one kid and one kid/hysterectomy. That second one messed me up!  Trying to care for a kid, a newborn, and the hysterectomy all at once was so tough. Most women are laid up for  weeks for either of these. Together is mind blowing. I understand you don\u2019t like her, but making sure a mom and kids could eat - heck, I would have been happy with just sandwiches. Anyway, it just brought be back to those days and - I should probably delete this because the entire thread of responses of you shouldn\u2019t have to help someone who can\u2019t barely function is heartbreaking", "YTA not that hard to throw a meal together. To just flat out refuse is pretty cold-blooded. Just a complete lack of empathy and human decency.", "NAH -\n\nHe just wants to do what his buddy asked him. He tried to get you to do it and you won't, which is **totally,** so now he's doing it himself. Good for him, as he should.\n\nThat said, if the cold shoulder continues, then he would be an asshole.\n\nI see nothing wrong with your behavior.\n\nThe friend and his wife are the bigger problems. SIX F-ing kids, while he's military? It certainly was time to stop adding to that mess. Good lord. I get that some of the kids are from a previous relationship, but just stop already.", "Chop suey?  With elbows and hamburger.  YTA unless you share a link showing this is a real food item and not a sign that you are a fakety fake poster.", "I said the same thing but apparently my husband's buddy wanted a \"big enough meal for leftovers\" so she can just feed her kids leftovers instead of worrying about where the next meal was coming from.", "What does military families have to do with this? Maybe they should have found another military family to help them? We are not military. We have never been military. We simply live next door to the girlfriend- which is how my husband even met this guy.", "Well.. I will say he doesn't cook much for me. So it is a bit off putting that he's making a giant meal for another woman when he only cooks at home maybe 3 times a year. Other than that though he's great.", "Yep. In a normal situation I would say NTA. But in a military community things tend to be a bit different.  I was in a similar situation at the OP when I had a baby less than a month old.  I ended up cooking about 3 weeks of freezer meals for a mama and her two kids when she was out on bedrest with her husband deployed. 8 months later when my husband was deployed she returned the favor by helping me with a bunch of yard work and babysitting my baby one night so I could have an evening off. \nIn this case though, the husband should have asked instead of demanded and they both should have worked together to get the meal made, IMO.", "> And is basically giving me the cold shoulder because I wouldn't do this for him.\n\nThat's why the husband is the asshole.", "What it boils down to is the fact that she has a support system who is there at least every other day and other people to help. So why I would be expected to make a giant meal for them when I have zero help at all is beyond me.", "I have an 8 week old who's pretty much permanently attached to my tit and I would have had to drive 30 minutes to the store to grab stuff I needed to cook for her. It would have been that hard, actually. I also don't have parents or friends who come here constantly like she does. She has a huge support system, whereas I don't even know anyone in this state outside of her. Not my problem, at all.", "Yeah weirdly enough, he joined when he found out Cindy was pregnant. He said that the military will help them out financially in the long run so he's after the benefits because at 35 years old, they don't have much. So I can see why he joined but it was bad timing, in my opinion.", "Well, to be fair, she just got a hysterectomy,  so they have stopped.", "Lol American Chop Suey, not Chinese. But here: https://thecozycook.com/american-chop-suey/", "Then order extra? Honestly, it's his friend and you just had a baby. It's pretty ridiculous to ask you to cook a huge meal when you have your new little one to focus on. Or why can't the dude order a meal for his family from an app or a restaurant? Furthermore, if she's a military wife, other military wives should step in.", "I gotcha. It wouldn\u2019t be your responsibility to do this for someone else regardless, but you might have responded differently if he was helping/doing the bulk of the cooking for you and your family already, which he is not. It might be worth expressing this to your husband, especially if he continues to give you the cold shoulder (you don\u2019t deserve that from him; he has no reason to be upset with you).", "I think what this signals is that he does not see himself as cooking for her. He sees himself as cooking for YOU, because he thinks YOU should be cooking for her. Further, he's not cooking for her (or you) because of her (or your) value to him, but because his buddy asked him to. It's his buddy that he's supporting here. I think the issue here is that it sounds like his primary bond is with his buddy. You are just part of their support network and he sees your role as being to support him and his buddy by following their commands. That is why it's of no consequence that you yourself only just had a baby.\n\nIf his primary bond were with you, then he would be cooking for you. You just had a baby 8 weeks ago, but he only cooks for you three times per year. There's a huge disconnect here that your husband doesn't even see. The fact that he doesn't see it, is a problem.", "You're N.T.A at all. It sounds like your husband volunteered you to cook for her or said yes if his buddy asked your husband to ask you. Basically, he assumed you'd say yes, so he said yes on your behalf. \n\nYour NDN has a support system, and she can ask them.", "So he joined, but they didn't get married? Half the point of joining for the benefits is that your spouse gets benefits and you get more of a housing allowance for being married (especially with step kids!). These people don't sound super bright.", ">Then order extra?\n\nSeriously, how hard is it to microwave pizza?  And leftover pizza is even better the next day.  Seems like the husband found a good solution and wife should have nothing to worry about.  But if hubby keeps cold-shouldering her, then he becomes the asshole.", "Agreed. It's fairly sexist (unsurprising) that the husband's friend would ask for his buddy's WIFE to cook a grand meal for his family.", "Well, I mean, we can't really afford to order that much takeout for them and his buddy didn't offer to pay us back. So the food was on our dollar."]}
