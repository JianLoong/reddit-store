The other one is in her questions phase and when you don't understand what she's saying, because she's 3, she gets pretty frustrated and tries to repeat it again but it sounds rude sometimes like she thinks we're the idiot for not understanding what she says. \n\nSo the other day my husband (27m), my brother (23m), my friend and I were all in a discord server playing a game and chatting. My friend had recently had a baby and he was talking to his kid who I'll call Mary, he told Mary not to take his phone and then when I chuckled he said yeah you wouldn't know anything about that would you sarcasticly. I laughed some more and told a few stories of what he had to look forward to as Mary got older. One of the stories was how we were in the store and the lady next to me said where's my phone and my oldest tried to give her my phone. There was some laughing and my friend said aww she's just being a sweet kid she was trying to help. My brother ended up laughing and saying she's not sweet she's a little bitch.\n\nI'll admit I got angry and immediately muted my microphone and stopped playing the game for a bit. I heard my brother say oh she's mad. And my husband chimed in with well maybe don't call our kid a bitch and she wouldn't be. I talked to my mom about it and she says I'm overreacting by being angry and that my brother loves the girls and I should forgive him and move on. My husband says he understands why I'm upset but that I shouldn't stop my brother from seeing the girls. I've slept on it and I'll admit I'm still angry but a part of me can't help but wonder if I shouldn't be? Like maybe he was just joking and I'm throwing it out of proportion? AITA for  not wanting him around the girls if that's what he thinks?\n\nEdit to add: Thank you for all the comments I'm reading them and even listening to the ones who said I was overreacting. So mom talked to my brother and after that he came over and said he was sorry and he shouldn't have said it and asked if we could just move on. I'm going to sit my husband down and explain why it bugged me so much and figure out why it didn't bother him as much as it did me", "created_utc": 1688218012, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nv50t/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_my_kids_away_from_my/", "score": 261, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Want to correct your language before I use your controller/keyboard to show you how much of a bitch you are? I\u2019ll shove that shit so far up your ass you\u2019ll have to use your tongue to play.

What\u2019s worse is he called your DAUGHTER, a female that. It\u2019s rude.\n\nI am sure that if you called his daughter, if he had one that, he would be pissed.", "NTA\n\nOMG. JFC I'm so angry reading this I can't explain. And I'm not a mom, I'm an aunt. Heck, maybe that's why I'm so angry. Who DOES that? Who calls a small child a bitch AT ALL, EVER?! And like, the swearing is bad enough, but the fact that he chose a specifically misogynistic slur for a tiny little girl who is literally just learning to navigate the world . . . I have steam coming out my ears.\n\nHonestly, I don't care if he would never say it to her face or around her. Your brother is DEEPLY immature, has a misogynistic streak a mile wide even if he doesn't realise it, and he should NOT be around those little girls until/unless he grows up a lot. Your husband couldn't be more wrong. Toddlers and preschoolers are like sponges. They hear and understand so much more than we realise (I've worked in early childhood education off and on for more than 30 years, so trust me, I know what I'm talking about), and they shouldn't be around adults who say stupid, shitty things, because they take those to heart in ways that echo around their little brains and make them wonder and worry.\n\nLook, I sat the other day and watched my ONE-YEAR-OLD nephew shake his head sadly after his dad just ignored him. Didn't even say anything mean . . . just didn't engage when the kid wanted to, and that baby shook his head as he crawled away, like, \"Daddy no wants.\" It broke my heart. Don't let your kids be around any adult who could hurt them at this age or make them question themselves. It's a BIG DEAL. \n\nAnd don't let anyone tell you that your brother is \"too young\" to know better because he's 23 and single. I was 17 when I started working at my first daycare, and I understood loving babies and being gentle with them and kind. I have seen my little boy cousins at the ages of 10 and 11 hold their baby cousins, cuddle them and coo over them. Your brother is cruel, and you are right not to want him near your daughters right now.", "NTA even if joking (which idk, it sounds like he had that all ready to go and in his brain already) who calls a fucking TODDLER a bitch?? Toddlers can be a lot and annoying and sometimes rude or even hurtful but A BITCH? About his (young child!!!) niece?\n\nNo way. At least for a while I don\u2019t know that you can trust his behavior toward your children. Who knows what he could say right to their face? I think you should take as much time as you need before you allow him to be around your kids and that can be forever if you want.\n\nKeep them babies safe.", "NTA\nWho calls a little girl a bitch? It\u2019s a sexually aggressive word, he should apologise to you.

She's 3!! Your husband needs to get on the same page as you. Your brother is despicable.", "NTA. If he were my brother that would have been the last time I ever spoke with him. No reasonable adult calls a little girl a B*tch, let alone their own niece.", "NTA. Never let your brother see your kids.", "Your brother laughed and \u2018corrected\u2019 someone calling your daughter a \u2018sweet kid\u2019, thereby telling everyone he does not like your daughter. He then follows up by calling her (a 3yo) a bitch, thereby showing everyone he has no respect for her as a person and lastly saying \u2018Oh, she\u2019s mad\u2019 in what I imagine is a condescending tone, thereby showing everyone that he has no respect for you either. \n\nThere was so many other things he could have said if he wanted to resort to name calling a 3yo (hellion, brat, menace, imp, little shit - non of them much better, but not sexually loaded either) but he went with the most misogynistic one. Yeah, no unsupervised visits for uncle misogynist! God know what he\u2019s going to call your kids to their face if they don\u2019t do what he wants. NTA", "NAH. Plenty of families can joke like this without someone getting hurt or upset. I don't think your brother is TA for what he said. You got upset, and that's perfectly reasonable. You are also not TA. I don't think people calling for your brother's head are being reasonable though, and you should consider that a lot of people would see this as playful banter. You don't have to accept that, but factor it into how long and how intensely you want to punish him for this.", "NTA, i mean i get how it can be a joke however time and place ?? also age ????? she\u2019s 3, she doesn\u2019t know any better", "NTA.

Secondly to make a misogynistic slur against a toddler? Sounds like your brother needs some education. You feel up to it?", "NAH. My guess is that he was joking in the same way I joke that my son can act like quite the little asshole sometimes (all kids are at some point tbh). I do understand why that statement was upsetting, although if he's otherwise been a good uncle and never says such things to the kids then I don't think I would restrict his access.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's a horrible human being who keeps complaining my grandfather hasn't died yet so he can get his inheritance. I hate him, and I have ever since I was old enough to understand how horrible he talked about and to all the kids in our family.
