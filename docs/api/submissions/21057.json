My friend had recently had a baby and he was talking to his kid who I'll call Mary, he told Mary not to take his phone and then when I chuckled he said yeah you wouldn't know anything about that would you sarcasticly. I laughed some more and told a few stories of what he had to look forward to as Mary got older. One of the stories was how we were in the store and the lady next to me said where's my phone and my oldest tried to give her my phone. There was some laughing and my friend said aww she's just being a sweet kid she was trying to help. My brother ended up laughing and saying she's not sweet she's a little bitch.\n\nI'll admit I got angry and immediately muted my microphone and stopped playing the game for a bit. I heard my brother say oh she's mad. And my husband chimed in with well maybe don't call our kid a bitch and she wouldn't be. I talked to my mom about it and she says I'm overreacting by being angry and that my brother loves the girls and I should forgive him and move on. My husband says he understands why I'm upset but that I shouldn't stop my brother from seeing the girls. I've slept on it and I'll admit I'm still angry but a part of me can't help but wonder if I shouldn't be? Like maybe he was just joking and I'm throwing it out of proportion? AITA for  not wanting him around the girls if that's what he thinks?\n\nEdit to add: Thank you for all the comments I'm reading them and even listening to the ones who said I was overreacting. So mom talked to my brother and after that he came over and said he was sorry and he shouldn't have said it and asked if we could just move on.

JFC I'm so angry reading this I can't explain. And I'm not a mom, I'm an aunt. Heck, maybe that's why I'm so angry. Who DOES that? Who calls a small child a bitch AT ALL, EVER?! And like, the swearing is bad enough, but the fact that he chose a specifically misogynistic slur for a tiny little girl who is literally just learning to navigate the world . . . I have steam coming out my ears.\n\nHonestly, I don't care if he would never say it to her face or around her. Your brother is DEEPLY immature, has a misogynistic streak a mile wide even if he doesn't realise it, and he should NOT be around those little girls until/unless he grows up a lot. Your husband couldn't be more wrong. Toddlers and preschoolers are like sponges. They hear and understand so much more than we realise (I've worked in early childhood education off and on for more than 30 years, so trust me, I know what I'm talking about), and they shouldn't be around adults who say stupid, shitty things, because they take those to heart in ways that echo around their little brains and make them wonder and worry.\n\nLook, I sat the other day and watched my ONE-YEAR-OLD nephew shake his head sadly after his dad just ignored him. Didn't even say anything mean . . . just didn't engage when the kid wanted to, and that baby shook his head as he crawled away, like, \"Daddy no wants.\" It broke my heart. Don't let your kids be around any adult who could hurt them at this age or make them question themselves. It's a BIG DEAL. \n\nAnd don't let anyone tell you that your brother is \"too young\" to know better because he's 23 and single. I was 17 when I started working at my first daycare, and I understood loving babies and being gentle with them and kind.

At least for a while I don\u2019t know that you can trust his behavior toward your children. Who knows what he could say right to their face?

And he's trying to refute this idea that she's a sweet kid.  \n\nI think the key here is what OP reported in the first paragraph -- the kid is in her questions phase, but can be hard to understand. But she gets frustrated having to repeat herself, and can sound rude and condescending. (Important: she isn't BEING rude and condescending, because she is THREE.  She's just getting a bit frustrated.  Adults have to be very careful not to ascribe adult motivations to the tone of little kids.)\n\nWhat I got out of this is that the brother (and probably everyone in the family) has experienced this with the kid.\n\nAnd what I FURTHER get out of this is that the brother is reacting to \\*what he perceives in\\* the kid's tone.  OP said it can sound rude.  To the brother, a female person being \"rude\" (or condescending) to him, or being too pushy, is being a bitch.\n\nAnd like, DUDE, she is fucking THREE.\n\nThis is absolutely a HIM problem, and how he reacts to female people using certain tones with him. It's all in HIS interpretation of the tone, too.  It has nothing to do with intent on the part of the other person.  He so reflexively reads tone as intent, that he's ascribing intent to a 3-year-old that is wildly out of proportion with the reality of her age.  \n\nEveryone else in the family is reacting like this is just nothing important.  Which strays perilously close to \"oh it's just locker-room talk\".  Not to get too deep about it, but -- OP's instinctive negative reaction is completely justified.  Him doing that, \\*because of\\* the way the little kid is navigating this developmental stage of asking questions and trying to make herself understood, reveals that he has some really deeply buried issues with how he thinks about women's interactions with him.\n\nIdeally, sitting him down and talking to him about it would be able to get him to take a deeper look at what it says about him that he had this reaction, and his mind leap to that word, based on his presumed annoyance with how the kid is expressing herself.", "I also think that, if he truly cares, he'll listen to OP, and examine WHY he jumped so quickly to say \"she's not a sweet kid, she's a little bitch\". (That is, that's what he was saying -- someone said she was a sweet kid, and he leaped to counter that with \"she's a little bitch\".)\n\nLike, get him to examine what it is about his interactions with the kid, that leave him feeling this way about her.  Then, get him to examine whether it's really appropriate for him to be putting HIS reaction on a 3-year-old. (Spoiler: it's not appropriate.)  \n\nThe conclusion I kind of come to is that this guy has some unconscious biases towards women being challenging to him. OP says the kid can come across as rude and condescending, when it's really just her frustration with trying to communicate.  It's on the adults who \"read\" her tone as rude and condescending, therefore.\n\nIt would be good for him to realize that he's having this reaction, and how it impacts him -- how it impacts his emotions, and how he's lashing out (even \"jokingly\" in response to them.  Because if he's that irritated by a 3-year-old, imagine how he reacts to adult women.  \n\n(Well -- don't even imagine; OP got angry and muted her voice channel, and he follows up with \"oh she's mad\" in what sounds like a sort of mocking way that clearly does not take OP's reaction seriously at all.  He says something offensive, a woman reacts to it by being offended, and he isn't \\*sorry\\* that he made someone mad, he just thinks she's overreacting or taking his \"joke\" too seriously or what have you. And this is \\*his sister\\*, who he's supposed to \"love\"!  Imagine how little respect he has for women outside of the family.)", "Agreed! People are really super reaching on this one! So reaching it's fucking comical!", ">that was his opportunity to say \"Sorry sis I was joking\" \n\nReally, the only acceptable reaction would have been for him to instantly say, \"Sorry, that was fucked up, I shouldn't have said that.\"\n\nI really despise it when people try to get out of saying something fucked up by saying \"I was joking\". Yeah -- you thought saying something fucked up was funny!  That doesn't make it any better!", "For the sake of your family I hope your uncle goes before your grandpa because he sounds like the type of person to take whatever he can from him both financially as well as physically ( as in furniture, family heirlooms, basically anything he could use or sell).", "I'm an aunt, and I'd snatch someone's head off if they called my niece's that.

I'm not sure it's \\*really\\* a compliment.  It's looking at an 8 year old girl, and thinking about the sexually active later-teen / adult she will become.\n\nWe need a LOT less of that.  It's creepy how many people look at children, and try to impose on them the attitudes that people will have towards them when they become adults.  It's making them grow up way too fast.  (Included in this category are all the people who buy their infants/toddlers clothing that suggests future romantic/sexual exploits or habits, or who immediately leap to claiming that infants or toddlers \"have a boyfriend/girlfriend\" if they act friendly with, or particularly like, another child.)\n\nLooking at a child that young, and only seeing either behavior or looks that you think will somehow affect their dating/sex prospects when they get old, is creepy.", "It is misogynistic.

Or did she get him to apologize solely to keep the peace?)", "I have a feeling, from the way this was written, that he wasn't calling her that because of the \"giving a phone to a stranger\" thing.  It was to refute the suggestion that she was \"a sweet kid\" by offering the phone.

She's just struggling with making herself clear (and maybe getting kind of frustrated doing that), which is only natural.\n\nOnly an immature, insecure adult would take this quirk of a 3 year old learning to speak and ask questions, and feel like the 3 year old was being judgey or bitchy towards him. SHE IS THREE.  \n\nAs others have said, this reveals a LOT more about the brother, his lack of judgement, and frankly, his insecurities about how he reacts to the way \"women\" treat him.

The way op described her daughter he meant it more as like strong willed with a little mean streak not in anyway in this context is it sexual!", "Thank you.", "I actually have no idea how many, due to some relatives being slutrageous and boning all over town. And no, not all of them were male. My grandmother had somewhere between 5 and 9 biological children depending on who is asked. She gave some away if she couldn't pass them off as her current husband's. (Fun fact, we also aren't sure how many times she was married! She said the number was three, but we've turned up four marriage licenses and a great aunt plus her daughter both swore there was a Mexican man, while all of the licenses are for men who we think were white judging from some ancestry searching. But one of the marriages doesn't appear anywhere in records we can find, we can't even find where to get another copy of the license and \n\nBut let's see... Going just by first cousins on my mom's side (to get to the triples, we gotta add in my paternal family and I cannot name all of those so can't count them, sorry. There's a bunch. Also, I add my direct aunts and uncle's grands because I was raised with them, hence the \"mostly\" in there, if I added all of my once removeds from whatever source, it'd hit triples much faster.)\n\nOldest Aunt: Seven kids, all boys. They're steps, but I was raised with them so I count them. I'm closer in age to most of their kids though (first cousins once removed, which due to some generation blurring I count some of the once removeds as simply \"first cousin\" so they're in the mix.) So thats #1 with two sons from one wife that we know of, #2 with four(?) by two wives unless he's had more with his new wife. Then #3 has one son, #4 supposedly has none but there are some children of single moms in my hometown that look awfully like my older cousins (who look like their pa) so who knows? #4 dates a lot though and I know he's sexually active often. #5 has three and last I checked 6/7 have no kids but its been 10 years since I last checked so no clue there. (17)\n\nOldest Uncle: I can't remember if he's got eight or ten. I know his last born brought him back to an even number though, so its one of those. I'll say eight to be conservative. And I'm not sure how many grands they have, but its over 20. So add 28 (17 + 28 = 45)\n\nNext Aunt, three kids. Son #1 has seven I know of, from at least three and maybe four women? Oh, and one that he says isn't his but everyone is pretty sure he is, and one that he says is his but we aren't sure because the conception date kinda falls weird. (He was likely in jail when the kid was conceived, but also he dates the kind of women who would definitely try to have sex during a jail visit so maybe? But I still dunno.) So call it eight if not nine. Daughter had two, and one stepdaughter who she claims, so three more. Younger son had none, he has Down Syndrome. Despite that, he's more of a father to #1's kids than he is. (They lived with their grandmother a lot and since I'm the same age as #1's oldest kid, these are the ones that feel the most like first cousins despite being once removeds) The other kids I dunno. #1 has seven grands I know of, his youngest daughter may have more, but we don't talk much as adults so I only know of that one. I'm not counting the grands though because that seems like cheating. Daughter has three grands. So there's another 17. (45 + 17 = 62)\n\nNext up is my mom, who has... me. I have a stepsister though. But there aren't any grands and even if there were, I can't call those cousins can I. So 1. (63)\n\nUncle #2 has three sons and 10 grands, no idea how many mothers, I assume just 3 but not a lot of contact there due to reasons. All his sons share a mom, my auntie. (76)\n\nUncle #3 (aka the family leech) has at least 2, maybe 4 depending on whether his ex's twins are his. If I assume the number is four, he has six grands, three from each twin and maybe more if the younger two have had kids by now. But I don't know any of his grands so I'll just add the four. Two moms (80)\n\nThen there's Uncle T, who is kinda adopted but kinda not? Like, I'm not sure what's up. He had a different last name from anyone else but my grandmother said he was her son and he grew up in her house, so I guess so? Two sons, unknown grands. One mother. (82)\n\nSo that's the maternal side, as I said, I need my paternal cousins to hit the triples. There's like 30 over there (My dad had a lot of siblings, some bio, some sorta adopted since his aunts sent him from house to house when they could get him away from his messed up parents, so all of HIS cousins are MY aunts and uncles) and I could not even begin to list them all. One uncle has one, an aunt has four, another aunt had three, and another had two, but beyond that there are another 14 of my dad's adopted siblings and most of them have children.\n\nSo I guess I lied a little, I think the removeds are more numerous than the \"true\" firsts, but in my defense, when I think of my first cousins, those are the ones I think about, not their parents who were adults before I was even born. (Uncles 2 and 3 have children my age or younger though, so their kids are less so.)", "Doesn\u2019t matter, it was said to the mother of the child.

Your brother needs to purge any derogatory language (especially towards females) from his vocabulary.  He just can't talk the same way around kids like he's been used to.  Your husband doesn't feel that gut-punch at the sound of \"bitch\" because he's a guy and has never been called a bitch and experienced all the negative feelings it engenders.  You don't want to cut off your brother as long as he understands the importance of how language can shape how our children see themselves and the world.  \n\nYou'll probably continue to argue about what words are ok and what aren't.  Everybody's doing it.  Believe me, it's better than the alternative.", "NTA. He called a 3 year old a bitch. That's the end of the argument. It doesn't matter if he was kidding or not. It doesn't matter if that's his niece. He shouldn't be talking about kids like that.", "NTA.

It may be because you bristled against that customary name women are called by men.

My take was on a bare fucking minimum that he could have said to indicate that he didn't mean it. It's a basement level statement and I'd still have had something to say like \"really? How was it funny\" (learned that from Reddit lol). \n\nSOMETIMES people make an out of pocket bad \"joke\" but they come correct when corrected. But this was not that time. And it wasn't funny at all but there could have been dialogue if he wasn't an AH. But no. He couldn't do that cause he's awful."]}
