My friend had recently had a baby and he was talking to his kid who I'll call Mary, he told Mary not to take his phone and then when I chuckled he said yeah you wouldn't know anything about that would you sarcasticly. I laughed some more and told a few stories of what he had to look forward to as Mary got older. One of the stories was how we were in the store and the lady next to me said where's my phone and my oldest tried to give her my phone. There was some laughing and my friend said aww she's just being a sweet kid she was trying to help. My brother ended up laughing and saying she's not sweet she's a little bitch.\n\nI'll admit I got angry and immediately muted my microphone and stopped playing the game for a bit. I heard my brother say oh she's mad. And my husband chimed in with well maybe don't call our kid a bitch and she wouldn't be. I talked to my mom about it and she says I'm overreacting by being angry and that my brother loves the girls and I should forgive him and move on. My husband says he understands why I'm upset but that I shouldn't stop my brother from seeing the girls. I've slept on it and I'll admit I'm still angry but a part of me can't help but wonder if I shouldn't be? Like maybe he was just joking and I'm throwing it out of proportion? AITA for  not wanting him around the girls if that's what he thinks?\n\nEdit to add: Thank you for all the comments I'm reading them and even listening to the ones who said I was overreacting. So mom talked to my brother and after that he came over and said he was sorry and he shouldn't have said it and asked if we could just move on. I'm going to sit my husband down and explain why it bugged me so much and figure out why it didn't bother him as much as it did me", "created_utc": 1688218012, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nv50t/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_my_kids_away_from_my/", "score": 544, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

JFC I'm so angry reading this I can't explain. And I'm not a mom, I'm an aunt. Heck, maybe that's why I'm so angry. Who DOES that? Who calls a small child a bitch AT ALL, EVER?! And like, the swearing is bad enough, but the fact that he chose a specifically misogynistic slur for a tiny little girl who is literally just learning to navigate the world . . . I have steam coming out my ears.\n\nHonestly, I don't care if he would never say it to her face or around her. Your brother is DEEPLY immature, has a misogynistic streak a mile wide even if he doesn't realise it, and he should NOT be around those little girls until/unless he grows up a lot. Your husband couldn't be more wrong. Toddlers and preschoolers are like sponges. They hear and understand so much more than we realise (I've worked in early childhood education off and on for more than 30 years, so trust me, I know what I'm talking about), and they shouldn't be around adults who say stupid, shitty things, because they take those to heart in ways that echo around their little brains and make them wonder and worry.\n\nLook, I sat the other day and watched my ONE-YEAR-OLD nephew shake his head sadly after his dad just ignored him. Didn't even say anything mean . . . just didn't engage when the kid wanted to, and that baby shook his head as he crawled away, like, \"Daddy no wants.\" It broke my heart. Don't let your kids be around any adult who could hurt them at this age or make them question themselves. It's a BIG DEAL. \n\nAnd don't let anyone tell you that your brother is \"too young\" to know better because he's 23 and single. I was 17 when I started working at my first daycare, and I understood loving babies and being gentle with them and kind. I have seen my little boy cousins at the ages of 10 and 11 hold their baby cousins, cuddle them and coo over them.

Toddlers can be a lot and annoying and sometimes rude or even hurtful but A BITCH? About his (young child!!!) niece?\n\nNo way. At least for a while I don\u2019t know that you can trust his behavior toward your children. Who knows what he could say right to their face?

I don't think so.", "I\u2019m so incredibly angry at OP\u2019s brother I can\u2019t even see straight. I am a mom but of a boy, and I\u2019ll be damned if I let him grow up becoming a toxic male. \n\nI despise OP\u2019s brother for being such a misogynistic asshole.", "THIS!!!", "It\u2019s not sexual. I\u2019ve called plenty of dudes bitches. It\u2019s just an insult.", "No we definitely were not raised that way. Mom worked as a daycare teacher for a majority of our lives growing up. They're not big on cussing at all either and every kid that's been near us growing up was younger than us and we were always taught to be careful with little kids and to be kind with our words.", "No, it's always completely inappropriate to call a 3 year old a bitch. It's not a joke, and maybe now people should get upset about that when it happens family or not. Where's the line for you? Is it OK if he does things like this directly to the kid throughout her childhood?", "Who the hell calls a toddler a bitch?", "Seems like he was trying to be edgy and cool, gamer bro style. Which is dumb, but expected when everyone involved is an adult. But he is an idiot that doesn't understand that it's different when you know the people in real life and also their ages. NTA", "Are you really putting this on the 3 year old instead of the 20 something?", "You\u2019re sooooo right, calling a *3 YEAR OLD* a bitch is such a mature and adult thing to say.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

And when she actually thought she was doing something nice by giving a phone \ud83d\udcf1 to a stranger who couldn't find hers?", "I mean, kinda both?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch\u201d *dehumanizing*\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my bitch.\u201d *dehumanizing and also somewhat sexual*\n\n\u201cI made them my bitch\u201d *aggressively sexual*\n\nWhat OP\u2019s brother said I would say is more dehumanizing than sexual, but it would give me pause because it\u2019s definitely a sexual word and not one I feel like I would ever feel comfortable using for a child, or even an older minor teen. \n\nI might call a badly behaved one spoiled, a brat, a jerk or even if they\u2019re bad enough an asshole, but I just really feel like bitch is distinctly \u201cwrong\u201d referring to a child and I\u2019m not really sure I can fully articulate why.", "\"Bitch\" is a pretty gendered insult. Other comments explain better than I can how it is a sexually charged insult.", "I'm so sorry then.  But it is also possible that it is a one-off and your brother is truly chastened.  Let's hope so.", "I swear people don\u2019t read at all. Obviously no. The post was if OP was an ahole and I said yes because she overreacted.", "His toddler niece at that. What a fool.", "Exactly! She's a baby and already showing empathy and problem solving skills. That's impressive!"]}
