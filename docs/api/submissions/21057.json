My friend had recently had a baby and he was talking to his kid who I'll call Mary, he told Mary not to take his phone and then when I chuckled he said yeah you wouldn't know anything about that would you sarcasticly. I laughed some more and told a few stories of what he had to look forward to as Mary got older. One of the stories was how we were in the store and the lady next to me said where's my phone and my oldest tried to give her my phone. There was some laughing and my friend said aww she's just being a sweet kid she was trying to help. My brother ended up laughing and saying she's not sweet she's a little bitch.\n\nI'll admit I got angry and immediately muted my microphone and stopped playing the game for a bit. I heard my brother say oh she's mad. And my husband chimed in with well maybe don't call our kid a bitch and she wouldn't be. I talked to my mom about it and she says I'm overreacting by being angry and that my brother loves the girls and I should forgive him and move on. My husband says he understands why I'm upset but that I shouldn't stop my brother from seeing the girls. I've slept on it and I'll admit I'm still angry but a part of me can't help but wonder if I shouldn't be? Like maybe he was just joking and I'm throwing it out of proportion? AITA for  not wanting him around the girls if that's what he thinks?\n\nEdit to add: Thank you for all the comments I'm reading them and even listening to the ones who said I was overreacting. So mom talked to my brother and after that he came over and said he was sorry and he shouldn't have said it and asked if we could just move on.

JFC I'm so angry reading this I can't explain. And I'm not a mom, I'm an aunt. Heck, maybe that's why I'm so angry. Who DOES that? Who calls a small child a bitch AT ALL, EVER?! And like, the swearing is bad enough, but the fact that he chose a specifically misogynistic slur for a tiny little girl who is literally just learning to navigate the world . . . I have steam coming out my ears.\n\nHonestly, I don't care if he would never say it to her face or around her. Your brother is DEEPLY immature, has a misogynistic streak a mile wide even if he doesn't realise it, and he should NOT be around those little girls until/unless he grows up a lot. Your husband couldn't be more wrong. Toddlers and preschoolers are like sponges. They hear and understand so much more than we realise (I've worked in early childhood education off and on for more than 30 years, so trust me, I know what I'm talking about), and they shouldn't be around adults who say stupid, shitty things, because they take those to heart in ways that echo around their little brains and make them wonder and worry.\n\nLook, I sat the other day and watched my ONE-YEAR-OLD nephew shake his head sadly after his dad just ignored him. Didn't even say anything mean . . . just didn't engage when the kid wanted to, and that baby shook his head as he crawled away, like, \"Daddy no wants.\" It broke my heart. Don't let your kids be around any adult who could hurt them at this age or make them question themselves. It's a BIG DEAL. \n\nAnd don't let anyone tell you that your brother is \"too young\" to know better because he's 23 and single. I was 17 when I started working at my first daycare, and I understood loving babies and being gentle with them and kind.

At least for a while I don\u2019t know that you can trust his behavior toward your children. Who knows what he could say right to their face?

And he's trying to refute this idea that she's a sweet kid.  \n\nI think the key here is what OP reported in the first paragraph -- the kid is in her questions phase, but can be hard to understand. But she gets frustrated having to repeat herself, and can sound rude and condescending. (Important: she isn't BEING rude and condescending, because she is THREE.  She's just getting a bit frustrated.  Adults have to be very careful not to ascribe adult motivations to the tone of little kids.)\n\nWhat I got out of this is that the brother (and probably everyone in the family) has experienced this with the kid.\n\nAnd what I FURTHER get out of this is that the brother is reacting to \\*what he perceives in\\* the kid's tone.  OP said it can sound rude.  To the brother, a female person being \"rude\" (or condescending) to him, or being too pushy, is being a bitch.\n\nAnd like, DUDE, she is fucking THREE.\n\nThis is absolutely a HIM problem, and how he reacts to female people using certain tones with him. It's all in HIS interpretation of the tone, too.  It has nothing to do with intent on the part of the other person.  He so reflexively reads tone as intent, that he's ascribing intent to a 3-year-old that is wildly out of proportion with the reality of her age.  \n\nEveryone else in the family is reacting like this is just nothing important.  Which strays perilously close to \"oh it's just locker-room talk\".  Not to get too deep about it, but -- OP's instinctive negative reaction is completely justified.  Him doing that, \\*because of\\* the way the little kid is navigating this developmental stage of asking questions and trying to make herself understood, reveals that he has some really deeply buried issues with how he thinks about women's interactions with him.\n\nIdeally, sitting him down and talking to him about it would be able to get him to take a deeper look at what it says about him that he had this reaction, and his mind leap to that word, based on his presumed annoyance with how the kid is expressing herself.", "I also think that, if he truly cares, he'll listen to OP, and examine WHY he jumped so quickly to say \"she's not a sweet kid, she's a little bitch\". (That is, that's what he was saying -- someone said she was a sweet kid, and he leaped to counter that with \"she's a little bitch\".)\n\nLike, get him to examine what it is about his interactions with the kid, that leave him feeling this way about her.  Then, get him to examine whether it's really appropriate for him to be putting HIS reaction on a 3-year-old. (Spoiler: it's not appropriate.)  \n\nThe conclusion I kind of come to is that this guy has some unconscious biases towards women being challenging to him. OP says the kid can come across as rude and condescending, when it's really just her frustration with trying to communicate.  It's on the adults who \"read\" her tone as rude and condescending, therefore.\n\nIt would be good for him to realize that he's having this reaction, and how it impacts him -- how it impacts his emotions, and how he's lashing out (even \"jokingly\" in response to them.  Because if he's that irritated by a 3-year-old, imagine how he reacts to adult women.  \n\n(Well -- don't even imagine; OP got angry and muted her voice channel, and he follows up with \"oh she's mad\" in what sounds like a sort of mocking way that clearly does not take OP's reaction seriously at all.  He says something offensive, a woman reacts to it by being offended, and he isn't \\*sorry\\* that he made someone mad, he just thinks she's overreacting or taking his \"joke\" too seriously or what have you. And this is \\*his sister\\*, who he's supposed to \"love\"!  Imagine how little respect he has for women outside of the family.)", "Agreed! People are really super reaching on this one! So reaching it's fucking comical!", ">that was his opportunity to say \"Sorry sis I was joking\" \n\nReally, the only acceptable reaction would have been for him to instantly say, \"Sorry, that was fucked up, I shouldn't have said that.\"\n\nI really despise it when people try to get out of saying something fucked up by saying \"I was joking\". Yeah -- you thought saying something fucked up was funny!  That doesn't make it any better!", "For the sake of your family I hope your uncle goes before your grandpa because he sounds like the type of person to take whatever he can from him both financially as well as physically ( as in furniture, family heirlooms, basically anything he could use or sell).", "I'm an aunt, and I'd snatch someone's head off if they called my niece's that.  And they are grown adults.", ">Now of course I understand that he was complimenting me, but at 8, I was upset...\n\nIt is, however, a very weird thing to say to an 8 year old girl. I'm not sure it's \\*really\\* a compliment.  It's looking at an 8 year old girl, and thinking about the sexually active later-teen / adult she will become.\n\nWe need a LOT less of that.  It's creepy how many people look at children, and try to impose on them the attitudes that people will have towards them when they become adults.  It's making them grow up way too fast.  (Included in this category are all the people who buy their infants/toddlers clothing that suggests future romantic/sexual exploits or habits, or who immediately leap to claiming that infants or toddlers \"have a boyfriend/girlfriend\" if they act friendly with, or particularly like, another child.)\n\nLooking at a child that young, and only seeing either behavior or looks that you think will somehow affect their dating/sex prospects when they get old, is creepy.", "It is misogynistic. You might call dudes bitches, but the term specifically arose from the comparison of human women to female breeding dogs.", "It sounds like your mom also needs a bit of a talking-to about her own reflexive instinct to defend him. \n\n(Although it's good, per your update, that she persisted, and caused him to come apologize to you. But I'm automatically suspicious of that kind of thing -- did she get him to apologize by getting him to realize how fucked-up it was?  Or did she get him to apologize solely to keep the peace?)", "I have a feeling, from the way this was written, that he wasn't calling her that because of the \"giving a phone to a stranger\" thing.  It was to refute the suggestion that she was \"a sweet kid\" by offering the phone.  It \\*sounded\\* like brother might be basing calling her a \"little bitch\" because of what the OP said about how she asks things, and repeats them and gets frustrated (insistent?) when someone can't understand her the first time, and it can sound rude / sound like she thinks you're an idiot for not understanding her.\n\nOf course, a mature adult realizes that a 3 year old isn't purposefully trying to be rude, or trying to imply that you're an idiot.  She's just struggling with making herself clear (and maybe getting kind of frustrated doing that), which is only natural.\n\nOnly an immature, insecure adult would take this quirk of a 3 year old learning to speak and ask questions, and feel like the 3 year old was being judgey or bitchy towards him. SHE IS THREE.  \n\nAs others have said, this reveals a LOT more about the brother, his lack of judgement, and frankly, his insecurities about how he reacts to the way \"women\" treat him.
