I want to know if I am really an asshole because I feel pretty right in my position.\n\nMy (19F) uncle (50M) is in the middle of a nasty divorce. He can't see his kids, he has 4 of them ages 3 to 10. His ex-wife has a restraining order against him. He's currently living with my grandad. I'm not saying I'm on the side of his ex-wife because I don't know the ins and outs of their divorce but she has always been very kind and supportive of me where my uncle has not. Also, whatever happened was clearly bad to the point of an order which has lasted 2+ months and is still ongoing.\n\nHe is also not my favourite uncle generally (I have 5). He was very intense and often played a lot of pranks on me when I was younger which made me cry and he would not apologise and tell me to toughen up. One time, I made a figurine out of clay in class and then he broke it for laughs and never apologised. My Dad glued it back together for me and told me that my uncle was just joking. I still hold a tiny grudge in the back of my mind because it was a figurine of me and my mum. He also is very loud and inserts his opinions where they are not wanted. He told me I should start looking at getting on the property ladder. I'm 19 and in this economy I'm clearly not going to get a house anytime soon.\n\nHe came over last night to chat to my Dad. I do not know if he was invited over, we both were very surprised when he showed up at our door so I don't think he was. He does this often and I hate it. Phones exist. I was annoyed. I wanted some me-time in the living room after a busy day which I now couldn't have. I said my hello and tried going upstairs but he asked me to make him a cup of tea. I said I was tired and my Dad ended up making him one.\n\nThis afternoon, my Dad called me rude for not making my uncle a cup of tea when he asked. I was so irritated because they were talking until 3am when I was trying to sleep and my uncle smoked and left the ashes in a jug I use to bake with. I let loose that it's not my responsibility to make him a cup of tea, he keeps dropping by with no warning and that it's no wonder he got divorced being so demanding and rude like that (he didn't say please when asking about the tea). Next time he can make his own damn tea.\n\nMy Dad told me to be more sympathetic and my Mum also agreed with him but I don't think I need to be sympathetic to someone who's probably abusive just because he's family. He has no consideration for anyone who is not himself.

No one is entitled to respect; it must be earned, by adults & kids alike.", "The distinction I was trying to make was: as a child, you are expected to defer with respect to senior family members. That's all. If OP was eight years old, and spoke rudely to a senior family member, their parent would be perfectly in line correcting them. \n\nDraw the line where you will, but by 19 that ship has sailed. Uncle Creepy needs to treat OP like a peer and fellow adult, if he wants to be treated with respect in turn.", "Fair enough.", "NTA he sounds like a real treat to be around and if his soon-to-be-ex has a restraining order out I'm sure he's done something pretty serious. Hold firm to those boundaries, he was not your guest and you do not owe him anything.", "Totally NTA. You're nicer than me. \n\nThe petty in me would wait until he's talking about how hurt he is and/or crying and then, tell him to toughen up. When anybody throws a fit about it, I'd simply say \"when I was in a vulnerable and/or hurt position, he'd tell me the same thing. I feel like that's how he shows support to me and that's led me to believe that's how he wants to be supported. If it was okay in the eyes of all the adults then it should be okay to do now unless you're wanting to be admitting to a double standard that never should have happened. In which case, I'll revert to not my monkeys so not my circus. I don't know what happened, it's not any of my business so, leave me out of it. Thank you.\"\n\n\nThat double standard you went through was preventable and unnecessary. At this point though, I don't think any apology will ever truly heal the consist wounding over the years.", "Just sounds like normal uncle behavior to be fair. I think y\u2019all could meet in the middle. Start being less thin-skinned and say something snarky when he teases you and I bet things start turning around. Sounds like he likes banter. Idk what all he\u2019s done tho so take this with long a grain of salt", "NTA. Your parents have been enabling his crap behavior for a long time. It doesn't mean you have to go along with it.", "Are you his maid? Or your father\u2019s maid? It\u2019s not the 1800s, he can make his own damn tea at his own house.\n\nProtective orders aren\u2019t given away like candy, he must\u2019ve done someone awful to his ex wife, kids or both. From how he used to behave with you as a kid he sounds unhinged, and your father is an enabling AH.", "NTA. Your uncle is *50* and is still coddled by your dad, that's *pathetic*, on top of him having been a bully and whatever he did to have a restraining order against him.\n\nBesides, your dad went and made the goddamn tea, *what's the problem*, he got his entitlement tea, good for him, and good for you for not also indulging this sorry excuse for an adult.\n\nStay strong while you're in the house, sadly I assume it will stay the same. Still. He wants tea? Seems there are two adults ready to bow to his every wish, they can make it for him.", "NTA point out that your uncle had 19 years to earn sympathy and goodwill from you. You didn't randomly decide to withhold the default \"neutral family\" goodwill, he actively treated you in a way that reduced your goodwill towards him until you're emotionally incapable of sympathy towards him.", "NTA, but Uncle most certainly is.

You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nYour uncle is a misogynistic, abusive, ass.\n\nAsk your parents why they haven't, and aren't, protecting you.\nHe used you for his own entertainment through the \"jokes\" that were never jokes.  He broke your stuff, because he could.  He sees you as less than him (could get his own damn tea), and here's the big one - WHAT PROOF DID HIS EX SHOW TO GET THE RESTRAINING ORDER? \n\nTime for your parents to put your emotional health & safety first.
