The sister was initially a teenaged mom whose parents housed and boarded her and her sons until the kids were 12.  When those parents retired, they could no longer afford to feed and house their daughter and her kids, so my then-single husband took them in, thinking that once the boys turned 18 and left home, their mother would move out, too. However, only one boy left home and went to work.  The other boy and his mother remained. The mother was employed, but she didn\u2019t help by paying rent or helping with house expenses. When she lost her job in 2011, she refused to look for work.  At the same time, my husband became unemployed.  He supported the sister, her unemployed adult son, and himself with credit cards and withdrawals from his 401k.  Eventually, my husband found a new job, and he continued to support them, and they continued to enjoy his generosity without assuming any of the financial burdens of their living expenses.  When I married my husband, his relatives still resided in his home, and by this time they had been there about 24 years.  His sister didn\u2019t want him to get married, and she demanded that he keep secret  from me how much money he gave her and her son. I object to the secret- keeping and consider that as interference in our marriage.  Recently, my husband has developed medical problems that have forced his retirement. I fear that we can no longer afford to financially support these two and keep his former home (he moved into my house.) They cannot move into our home because they can\u2019t get along with anyone.  AITA for insisting that my husband cuts off his support of his sister and her adult son, considering that our income is now greatly reduced? After all, his father cut off their support when he retired for the same reason.

His credit should probably be frozen, too, as a precaution.  I wonder if your husband would give you power of attorney, and if being married would help you get it sooner, rather than later.\n\nIf they have been incurring debts in his name, your husband would be responsible for them unless he makes a police report.
