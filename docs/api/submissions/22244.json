If someone in the bathroom wants privacy and the door has the ability to lock, then they should lock the door. Your sis seems dramatic and self centered, as if you should read her mind and know she was already in there to avoid her being walked in on. Also, instead of taking this as a learning experience, she probably is thinking that a closed door always should be knocked on first, at least when she is on the other side. She should admit that she fucked up by not locking the door. Knocking on a closed bathroom door every single time will get repetitive and tiring, imo.\n\nYou could set her up to fail, if you know her routine at all. Go use the bathroom before you know she will, but try to go in when she doesn\u2019t see. Close the door but don\u2019t lock it. Get up to some CRAZY shenanigans in there very quietly. I\u2019m picturing like a costume with lots of feathers and wild makeup and rhinestone stickers\u2026 but get creative! Go wild! Then when she walks in, scream like bloody hell and then repeat, verbatim, exactly all the things back at her that she said to you. If she knocks on the door, say you didn\u2019t hear and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t respond, wear headphones or something as part of the \u201ccostume\u201d to make it plausible you couldn\u2019t hear.\n\nIt\u2019s bad advice and she\u2019ll have the retort that you set her up, which *is* correct, but the same rules apply either way.

If your sister is 25 and like this, there might be some deep rooted problems on her end. I would maybe try to make amends or talk it out but I don't know the specifics of your relationship and dynamic.

And my partner explained that because the door had been painted so many times the lock on the outside was painted over, so if anything happened whilst the door was locked, they had to unscrew it off its hinges and wiggle the latch. This happened once with a friend of my partners, before we met, and they locked themselves in the bathroom, had a panic attack and passed out, it took 30-45 minutes to get the door off and get to them, so after that they made the rule that people can't lock the door. So for me it was habit and I locked it without thinking. Unfortunately the shower curtain pole fell a few times whilst I was in the shower, and a couple of times it caught the curtain pole and that fell on me as well, and my partner tried to get in to check on me and couldn't get in, I was fine so was able to get to the door to unlock it, but after that we formed an agreement that I would lock it if I was on the toilet (as it would be safe), but wouldn't lock it if I was in the shower (due to risk)", "If you have a hard time accepting judgement then why\u2019re you posting?
