I am often tasked with running errands for the family I work for, and they have given me a work credit card for expenses while we are out. I am allowed to occasionally use the card to go out to eat with the kid I nanny (NK) while we are running errands. \n\nThe other day, we were out and I decided to stop in at a deli for lunch. It was a small shop with 3 tables. They had one bathroom. I needed to change my NK\u2019s diaper and so I placed our order, told the cashier we were going to the bathroom while we waited, and took my NK in the bathroom to change him. \n\nMy NK is going through a phase where he hates having his diaper changed. I think it\u2019s because he had a horrible diaper rash a few weeks ago that looked super painful and that\u2019s when this all started. \n\nHe starts crying and screaming the second I lay him down, and it takes me calmly talking to him for a few minutes and stroking his hair for him to chill out and stop flailing. Then I hand him a toy to distract him and change him. The family I work for uses very complicated cloth diapers as well, the whole process takes like 15 minutes. \n\nWhen we went to the bathroom, we were the only customers in the shop. As soon as I laid him down and he started freaking out, someone knocked on the door. I said \u201cI\u2019ll be out in a few minutes!\u201d And continued what I was doing. After like 5 or so minutes, once he had chilled out and I had began the diaper change (it was a bad one) this woman knocked again loudly. I said \u201cstill in here\u201d and she started yelling through the door, \u201cI am a senior and I have bladder issues, I need to use this bathroom.\u201d I said \u201cI am changing a diaper, and I\u2019ll be out soon.\u201d \n\nNot even thirty seconds later she started POUNDING on the door, full on screaming to get out and scared my NK who started crying. I got mad and lost my cool and yelled \u201cTHIS IS A PUBLIC BATHROOM. I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE IN HERE. SHUT UP AND GO AWAY\u201d and after that she stopped banging. I came out with my NK on my hip and this woman didn\u2019t say a word but was very elderly and she was shooting me dagger eyes as she hobbled crouched over into the bathroom. I was so embarrassed at what just happened I just grabbed our sandwiches and left and we ate in the car. AITA for screaming at her?

Her problem was legit but adult incontinence products also exist for a reason.\n\nBut you should be able to change the baby's diaper without adding extra minutes for calming talk, smoothing hair, and toy play---squirmy or not. Especially since you are a professional nanny. And screaming shut up and go away was unnecessary.", "15 minutes is long. I sympathize with your situation, but it's incredibly inconsiderate to everyone else. I would have rushed the diaper change even if my son fussed and cried, and calmed him down after, outside the bathroom, so YTA here. Sorry.

Was it a little longer than usual? Yes, but life happens. It's a single bathroom sure, but I mean other unfortunate situations can happen in single bathrooms that people just have to wait for. As someone with IBS, I have hogged those bathrooms before, because I had no choice. I usually try to go where there are more stalls, but sometimes there's not. Somethings we can't easily control and living in a society with other people means having to be patient and wait our turns sometimes. If I had a stomach problem and had to wait longer for the bathroom, I would go near by to find another one, not sit out there and scream at the person in the bathroom ahead of me.", "Edit: \n\nGiven your response.

Sometimes that makes people an AH but i get it. She thought she could make you move faster, which doesn't really work... Except this time when you began to rush because she knocked a second time. \n\nYTA because you admit that not only does it take 15 minutes on a good day but that with a blow out and with you rushing it takes 15 minutes...

Drawing out this whole experience that this kid doesn't understand. \n\nSo yeah everyone sucking. \n\n\n\nINFO: How does making the diaper process longer, more intensive, and more time consuming decrease his stress around it potentially hurting? \n\nI think this is a YTA. \n\nSoothing helps but if this kid is that scared of a thing (reasonably from past experiences) that is not going to happen because he doesn't have a rash... No amount of drawing out the process is going to convince him it's not going to hurt or that he shouldn't be scared. Especially when he's still in full on diapers... \n\nA quick. Okay bud, quick and fast and we'll be done without any pain... See i know you were scared but it didn't hurt this time right? Okay.. let's go..m would have been kinder than drawing this out so he can panic for 15 minutes as opposed to five minutes.\n\nDeciding to do 'the whole routine' in a public space was a bad call, as you are aware. It's not your space where you can guarantee you have a comfy cozy 15-30 minutes to draw out this kids misery and call him down over and over... \n\n\nSomeone knocked the second you laid him down. You didn't have time for a 15 minute session.

In an ideal situation? Sure, absolutely. But when you're in a public bathroom and someone is knocking hard on the door and TELLING YOU THAT SHE HAS A MEDICAL ISSUE THAT SHE NEEDS THE FACILITIES FOR, then as a professional nanny you should have the skills to get a diaper on an uncooperative, upset baby in 2-3 minutes, 5 minutes max, GET HIM OUT OF THAT BATHROOM, and then settle him afterwards. \n\nHonestly, I don't think I've taken 15 whole minutes to change a diaper in my entire 30+ years of childcare, except maybe in a couple of instances of massive poop blowouts that required tons of wipes and a clothing change. \n\nThis is literally your profession. Take pride in being a professional. What you did was great if you were in a situation to take your time. But as it is you were thoughtless and actually caused another human being physical pain (and possibly a humiliating accident) because you only knew one, time-consuming way to do something that you should be way more efficient at.
