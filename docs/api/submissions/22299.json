As long as you accept your parents can welcome whatever guests they like, with or without notice, they should accept that you don't have to be there for their guests. At 15 you're at the age where you're transitioning from being dependent on parents to being independent with support from parents (if you have good parents) and part of that for teens is not having family invade your bedroom and not making small talk for hours with visiting family. It's a redrawing of familial relationship lines, if that makes sense, and a normal part of growing up. Your hormones aren't telling you to abandon family but they are telling you to ditch being the child and get some autonomy and for teen males that often means quick courtesy to visiting family then private / solitary time in your space. \n\nYou should shower anyway but from what I have seen of teen family members (including my age contemporary male cousins) teens shower when they aren't forced to be social other than the bare minimum and their space and alone time is respected.", "NTA.\n\nYou said hello, you said goodbye, you were more polite than I would have been in not throwing them physically out of your room when they invaded your space.\n\nTell your parents that the family came to see them, not you, that it was their responsibility as host to entertain their relatives, not yours, and that family or not, you do not have to spend time with people you don\u2019t want to spend time with.", "ESH - why didn't you simply make yourself scarce before they arrived?

Spoons are not infinite.", "OP isn't depressed. They're 15. 15 year old boys are known for withdrawing from family socializing. Boys do it from 14-ish to 19-ish, it's a normal transition from being a child to being a man. They're neither one or the other and they're a bit isolated from family to force family to accept the change from one to the other. It doesn't mean they're depressed or rejecting family, it's just hormones trying to start independence.\n\nMy dad, at 18, moved hundreds of miles with his parents that he disagreed with. I said he didn't have to, he was 18, he had friends and a job, all of which his parents disapproved of. He moved because his disapproving parents were still his safe space he wanted independence from but they weren't bad parents he wanted to be cut off from. My dad's father died young, when my dad was 23. My dad accepted my independence but accepted me as an adult when I was about 25 and said he'd have liked that from his dad - not just independence but acceptance as an adult you can disagree with but with no parental authority over but still with a parent-child relationship. From puberty onwards there's the struggle between independence with family ties and a parent-child relationship and transitioning between the two. It's not depression to fight the parent-child relationship, especially if parents are unwilling to let go. If parents are unwilling to let go the battle is fought in small rebellions, like not showering, but if that's what's happening not showering and not being social for the entirety of unexpected hours long visits by family isn't depression. It's just normal independence trying to assert itself where it can without rejecting parents in the process.", "I'm an adult and I'm like your son.

I think the correct way to approach this kind of situation is to talk to your parents beforehand about how you are not feeling up to a long social visit, then be there to greet your cousins at the door with your family, make chit chat for a few minutes, and then make a polite excuse and say for example \"it's been really great catching up with you but I'm not feeling well today and I need to go sleep for a bit, have a great visit and please let me know when you're leaving so I can come say goodbye\".

Do you have a medical degree?\n\nI don't assume depression when there is no need to assume depression. Being 15 and not wanting family in your bedroom and not wanting to be social with family for hours isn't a clinical sign of depression, it's a sign of being a 15 year old boy. It's not \"suck it up\" or \"you'll grow out of it\", it's wanting to start being independent without cutting off family. OP showered and greeted family, but didn't like them invading his space or forcing hours of social contact. That is just being a non-depressed teen seeking adulthood. Some teens are\ndepressed and need more than platitudes and bad advice but that doesn't mean OP is one of them when nothing he said indicates depression but does indicate he is just a teen with hormones on the path to adulthood. Not wanting nosy family poking about a messy room that's your private space is normal teen, not a sign of clinical depression.", "Like I said. \n\nYou don't get to determine what is or isn't depression, for anyone, without a medical degree.\n\nIsolating oneself from everyone, not having the energy/will to shower/not cleaning your room, to the degree that you are ashamed for others to see the state of it, while, yes, COULD be a sign of typical teenage irresponsibleness/laziness.\n\nBut it COULD also be a sign of depression.  Hence why I have told op that of he is having more bad days then good days, to consider seeking out a diagnosis, or at least consider talking to someone to rule out the possibility of depression.\n\nNot showering isn't good for you.  Regardless of whether you consider it normal teenage behavior or not, it should be actively discouraged.  \n\nTeenagers, particularly male teenagers, sweat a lot, are typically more active, and typically smell bad, especially if they aren't on top of their hygiene. \n\nGetting a consult to rule out diagnosis' is never a bad thing.  It means that he has the reassurance that he isn't depressed if the consult comes back clear, and if the consult comes back that he is in fact depressed, he can seek treatment.\n\nI don't know why you are so against the idea that a teenager could possibly be depressed, but I guess that's not my problem to deal with.  \n\nAll I can do is advise op as to my opinion, and wish him the best."]}
