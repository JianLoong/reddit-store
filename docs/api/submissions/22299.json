Not for everyone, anyway \n\nOp, if you have more \"bad' or \"rough\" days then you do \"good\" or even \"okay\" days consider getting evaluated by a doctor/psychiatrist for depression.

Period.  The end.  Use your spoons for what is important:  showering, making sure to drink water, and eat something.

Get over yourself. You didn\u2019t have to shower and socialize, but by not doing it, then yes YTA.

It sounds like you may be struggling with some depression, lack of motivation to shower or clean your room can be signs. Have you talked to your parents about your mental health? A good therapist may be able to help.", "I have a 17 year old who I liken to a cat. Sleeps all the time and I only see him when he's hungry. You know, like a normal teenager.\n\nIf we have people round that he knows, I will ask him to pop his head around the door at some point and say Hi and do a minute or two of small talk, but that's it. Sometimes I wish ***I*** could go and hide in a room when we have guests and I'm a grown-ass woman.\n\nI can kinda see your parents side of it if you don't see your relatives very often, but trying to make you spend a whole afternoon bored out of your mind is a bit much, especially if you've had a rough day. Makes me think that they are trying to project the vision of a 'Perfect Family Unit' to your relatives.\n\nThem coming into your room is a total invasion of your privacy and I hope that they at least knocked first. Can't really give you any advice about that other than sit there in your underwear and scratch your balls every time they come into your room to try to strike up a conversation. Make them uncomfortable in your personal space.\n\nNTA.", "I don\u2019t care for the downvotes YTA \n\nThe world doesn\u2019t revolve around you, they gave you enough notice to have a shower (which you should be doing anyone) leave your room and shut the door so no one sees your mess. \n15 mins chat wasn\u2019t going to hurt you, especially for family you don\u2019t see very often.", "YTA. Grow up, shower, and put on your big boy pants. The world will chew you up otherwise.", "Sorry, YTA.  They gave you an hours notice so it's not like they showed up at your door unannounced.  You could have used that time to straighten up your room or left your room, closed the door and went to see them in the family area but you sulked instead.  I get that life can be draining sometimes but you didn't make the minimum effort here.", "NTA. It\u2019s perfectly normal for someone your age to not feel up to socializing. There are going to be times when you have to no matter how you feel about it, like at work, but home should be your safe space. I don\u2019t think one hours notice is enough. People expect kids to be able to \u201csnap to\u201d and act a certain way regardless of how they feel, and that\u2019s ridiculous. Most adults don\u2019t have that kind of self control, it\u2019s stupid to expect it of a teenager.", "My siblings all did the same when our relatives come over.
