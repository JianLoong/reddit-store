People expect kids to be able to \u201csnap to\u201d and act a certain way regardless of how they feel, and that\u2019s ridiculous.

I need 24h minimum to mentally prepare.\n\nThe problem is that OPs parents seem to have very different personalities than OP, which will likely always remain a source of tension.

Meeting the relatives somewhere outside the home, such as at a restaurant or cafe would be a fair compromise.\n\nOP are you Asian?

As long as you accept your parents can welcome whatever guests they like, with or without notice, they should accept that you don't have to be there for their guests. At 15 you're at the age where you're transitioning from being dependent on parents to being independent with support from parents (if you have good parents) and part of that for teens is not having family invade your bedroom and not making small talk for hours with visiting family. It's a redrawing of familial relationship lines, if that makes sense, and a normal part of growing up. Your hormones aren't telling you to abandon family but they are telling you to ditch being the child and get some autonomy and for teen males that often means quick courtesy to visiting family then private / solitary time in your space. \n\nYou should shower anyway but from what I have seen of teen family members (including my age contemporary male cousins) teens shower when they aren't forced to be social other than the bare minimum and their space and alone time is respected.", "NTA.\n\nYou said hello, you said goodbye, you were more polite than I would have been in not throwing them physically out of your room when they invaded your space.\n\nTell your parents that the family came to see them, not you, that it was their responsibility as host to entertain their relatives, not yours, and that family or not, you do not have to spend time with people you don\u2019t want to spend time with.", "ESH - why didn't you simply make yourself scarce before they arrived?

You were polite, but honored your needs as well. Well done.", "Finally a comment that doesn\u2019t infuriate me \n\nYou\u2019re right though. Depression isn\u2019t something that can be just snapped out of like that.\n\nAnd even ignoring the depression. No one is entitled for socialization. If someone thinks you entitled for someone to socialize with them or that depression can be snapped out of that easily, then they need to be the ones to get on their big boy pants \n\nOf course no contact at all isn\u2019t the most healthy. But even so, I think it\u2019s more than a little annoying when people act all entitled to this.\n\nBesides as a comment mentioned.  It\u2019d be considered ruder for them to leave the room while clearly not in a good mood. So what\u2019re they supposed to do fake being happy and tire themselves out more?", "You said what I wanted to more civil then I would have. OP sounds depressed and not teenager angst. Spoons are not infinite.", "OP isn't depressed. They're 15. 15 year old boys are known for withdrawing from family socializing. Boys do it from 14-ish to 19-ish, it's a normal transition from being a child to being a man. They're neither one or the other and they're a bit isolated from family to force family to accept the change from one to the other. It doesn't mean they're depressed or rejecting family, it's just hormones trying to start independence.\n\nMy dad, at 18, moved hundreds of miles with his parents that he disagreed with. I said he didn't have to, he was 18, he had friends and a job, all of which his parents disapproved of. He moved because his disapproving parents were still his safe space he wanted independence from but they weren't bad parents he wanted to be cut off from. My dad's father died young, when my dad was 23. My dad accepted my independence but accepted me as an adult when I was about 25 and said he'd have liked that from his dad - not just independence but acceptance as an adult you can disagree with but with no parental authority over but still with a parent-child relationship. From puberty onwards there's the struggle between independence with family ties and a parent-child relationship and transitioning between the two. It's not depression to fight the parent-child relationship, especially if parents are unwilling to let go. If parents are unwilling to let go the battle is fought in small rebellions, like not showering, but if that's what's happening not showering and not being social for the entirety of unexpected hours long visits by family isn't depression. It's just normal independence trying to assert itself where it can without rejecting parents in the process.", "I'm an adult and I'm like your son.  During major family gatherings, I show up, have a few minutes of conversation I can stand, then normally head to a corner with a snack or a drink and just sit.\n\nI'm present, if someone wants to talk, they know where to find me but I just find comfort in just being with my family, without the need to have soliloquies on a slightly interesting event in my normally boring life.\n\nMy mom has long come to understand this from me and accepted it.  I try but get overwhelmed.", "Your right the world doesn\u2019t revolve around OP, but by the same token it doesn\u2019t revolve around anyone else. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if they are family who they don\u2019t see often or not, OP did not want to see or talk to them.", "Nah,if he doesn\u2019t want he doesn\u2019t want,its his decision", "I don't intend to be rude or anything, but I feel like you are quite ignorant.\n\nPeople have to realise  that, yes, you can get depression even if you didn't witness or suffer something 'life-alarming'.\n\nDepression happens when there is an imbalance of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine in our brain. It can also be hereditary.\n\nWhat OP described about himself can be  attributed with depression. Irritability, the inability to do the even the most basic hygienic routine, that feeling of sadness etc..\n\nI know this because I have depression. I am recovering slowly.\n\nAnd also, would you like it if someone, came into your room, which is supposed be *your private space*, uninvited? It must surely be uncomfortable.", "Literally though\n\nLike it's far worse for not only the family, who will consider op rude and stuck up if he comes out of his room and is an asshole/withdrawn/clearly doesn't want to be there the entire time, and the family feels bad because they wonder what they did wrong; and for op who will almost certainly get a lecture from his parents about how to \"treat his family/guests/the expectations around family time\" if his parents ate anything like mine\n\nAlso;  it sounds to me like op is an introvert\n\nIntrovets recharge their spoons alone;  not by masking and pretending to be happy in social situations that are ACTIVELY draining spoons that that AREN'T THERE \n\nYou're correct, he made the right choice, imo", "Unless you are OP you don't know whether he is depressed or not.\n\nAre you a doctor?  Do you have a medical degree?  If not then I don't want to hear it.  \n\nThat's why I specifically suggested to op to see someone who DOES have the capability to diagnose or rule out depression. \n\nJust because YOU think this is typical teenage behavior doesn't mean it is.  \n\nEveryone adjusts to the transition from adolescence, to teenager, to adulthood differently.  As I stated IN MY POST.  I was diagnosed with depression at age 12.  \n\nIt happens.  It doesn't hurt for OP to at least talk to someone to rule things out, rather than take bad advice like \"suck it up\"  or \"you'll grow out of it\" or \"it's just part of being a teenager\".", "And so his depression will continue and he\u2019ll end up alone and bitter and wonder what went wrong in his life. \n\nMental health is important, but so many people don\u2019t get better because they continue to isolate themselves and don\u2019t do basic adulting like showering and meeting family", "Yeah, no.  Dealing with drop-in family isn't going to cure his depression.", "Socialising does help manage depression, \n\nSitting alone sinking in your room doesn\u2019t", "In some cases perhaps; in others it actually worsens the situation, especially if the sufferer is resentful of the imposition and rationalizes that giving in will only ensure more of the same."]}
