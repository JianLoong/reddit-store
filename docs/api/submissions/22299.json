Spoons are not infinite.", "OP isn't depressed. They're 15. 15 year old boys are known for withdrawing from family socializing. Boys do it from 14-ish to 19-ish, it's a normal transition from being a child to being a man. They're neither one or the other and they're a bit isolated from family to force family to accept the change from one to the other. It doesn't mean they're depressed or rejecting family, it's just hormones trying to start independence.\n\nMy dad, at 18, moved hundreds of miles with his parents that he disagreed with. I said he didn't have to, he was 18, he had friends and a job, all of which his parents disapproved of. He moved because his disapproving parents were still his safe space he wanted independence from but they weren't bad parents he wanted to be cut off from. My dad's father died young, when my dad was 23. My dad accepted my independence but accepted me as an adult when I was about 25 and said he'd have liked that from his dad - not just independence but acceptance as an adult you can disagree with but with no parental authority over but still with a parent-child relationship. From puberty onwards there's the struggle between independence with family ties and a parent-child relationship and transitioning between the two. It's not depression to fight the parent-child relationship, especially if parents are unwilling to let go. If parents are unwilling to let go the battle is fought in small rebellions, like not showering, but if that's what's happening not showering and not being social for the entirety of unexpected hours long visits by family isn't depression.

I think the correct way to approach this kind of situation is to talk to your parents beforehand about how you are not feeling up to a long social visit, then be there to greet your cousins at the door with your family, make chit chat for a few minutes, and then make a polite excuse and say for example \"it's been really great catching up with you but I'm not feeling well today and I need to go sleep for a bit, have a great visit and please let me know when you're leaving so I can come say goodbye\".
