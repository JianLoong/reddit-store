If a trainer wants you to trust them (not yourself) they have to make you feel like you don't know what your doing. To me this seems like it could be a way to make you think you need their help. Honestly it's a great sales tactic.\n\nYou don't need a lot of qualification to be a trainer, this isn't like not believing a doctor. It's more like not believing someone who comes up to you in the supermarket and tells you you're buying the wrong groceries because they're a wellness coach.\n\nAnd it's not like there is one way to squat. The last two highly qualified personal trainers I worked with, one said my knees needed to push out more, the other said I needed to push them out less. It's like diet.

Maybe you had bad form and had a higher injury risk. I always listen when people give me unsolicited advice. I don\u2019t always follow it, but I at least listen to see what they say.", "YTA.  Nothing more to add that hasn't been said already.", "You\u2019re NTA for not listening to him but your response was dickish.", "NAH. If you wanna injure yourself that\u2019s your choice", "Is KOTAH a thing? If you actually said what you typed with \"if I wanted your advice I would've asked\" is rude so kinda.", "NTA he was trying to sell  you training", "I actually think YTA. I would have said N/TA if you had left it at \u201cno thank you\u201d but damn, that was rude as hell.", "Was this a person employed by the gym? I wouldn\u2019t take advice from a rando, but if one of the gym\u2019s personal trainers offered me advice, I would probably take it. Or at least I wouldn\u2019t be rude about it. It\u2019s literally their job to teach people how to lift and come up with workouts.", "YTA just like. In general. You were mildly rude in how you turned down the offer, but were still mostly in the NAH territory. What you've revealed about how you think about people and how you treat others makes you just. A massive AH in life.", "YTA\n\nBro you could politely say \u201cno thank you\u201d rather than be a dick", "Very Soft YTA but not to the trainer- No need to quote Trainers. That's what they are. People who train people who care to listen to experts and don't simply thing 'they know all they need to know'. Maybe a grip change or whatever the advice was could lower injury risk/make an exercise more engaging and effective. Now you'll never know.\n\nProbably didn't bug the person, the way they asked was clearly an acknowledgement that some people, for a variety of reasons, don't want advice from a stranger. Maybe your doing specific exercises a doctor has you doing for PT and don't want to go into the why you can't change anything about your grips/motion. All sorts of reasons to say NTY.\n\nBut Refusing advice because you didn't ask for it is really... weird. Not because you don't think it's valuable, not because you think the dude had some other motivation, just because you don't like help being *offered?*\n\nI don't think you're an asshole to him. Just yourself. Take the advice, exercise is a complex science, it's O.K. to take help in making your workout the best it can be. Also just in general, try and sort out 'unsolicited advice' from 'offers of advice' and consider if the offer could be helpful. If dude bro lifting next to you trys to lecture you it's one thing, a trainer offering a tip is a whole other. The second is something to take.", "NTA.  He asked a question and you said no.  What\u2019s the problem?", "This guy knows he's the asshole, he's literally in the comments being an asshole to everyone and asking why he should be polite to random strangers, even ones trying to help. He's probably just posting here to get a reaction from people. YTA.", "YTA- prime example of a douchebagel", "NAH, can't wait to get my own salty response for this. Dude was doing his job. It's not that big of a deal. It wasn't an insult or intrusion, he's trying to find clients or maybe wanting to prevent an injury. No, I'm not making an assumption about your form. Yes, he should've taken the no at the first. Most people here don't think he was in the wrong, seems like you just wanted us to say he was. Trainers will come up to you without you asking. If it makes you mad workout at home my guy.", "Nta, as a person who hates unsolicited advice I understand where you are coming from but you couldve been a bit nicer about it. Like just say \"no thanks, I'm good\" and leave it at that.", "I agree with everyone's response on here. Also want to say that you should take the advice... The amount of people I see doing lifts wrong in the gym is overwhelming. As someone who used to power lift and tore bicep tendons and lots of other injuries in the process, listen to the people who want to help you with your form. You shouldn't take it so personal if someone is offering you form help with something that is completely dependent on form to reap benefits. \nI get not wanting to hear it, but free advice from professionals is pretty awesome.", "Was going to say NTA before reading your comments. YTA.  Gym bro definitely has bad form. Put your ego aside before you get hurt.", "All you do is making fun of everyone who's answering YOUR OWN POST/ question \nYTA", "AFter being told no he tried the \"I was a powerlifter\" to get him to listen and was still told no. Then they sent someone else over to persuade OP that the trainer is worth listening to.\n\nA \"do you need any help\" and a no is where that should have ended.", "How is it passive aggressive to tell someone I don't want their advice? That word, I don't think you know what it means.", "I am rude unfortunately.  People only like polite folks. Not rude people with rude boundaries.", "Lol I love being polite to literal randoms.", "Lol did I rub you the wrong way because I told someone I didn't want their advice? Jesus I bet you let random people talk to you all the time.", "Good point and respect to you. I will apologize to him. Thank you.", "Oh no the sass!", "This exactly. Like I get by the letter of the law you can tell someone to F off if you want but people on this sub sometimes forget about not having to be a dick out in the wild. You can be pleasant and just say no thanks. OP sounds like a major AH to me.", "Agreed. Op comes across as hostile for no reason.", "Wow. I\u2019m 27 and hope to be on your level some day, sir.", "How do you know if it would have been good advice?", "No smugness here, I dislike receiving unsolicited advice.", "Not pride.", "Missed a chance to Not get seriously injured too.", "Good point. If I see him again I will apologize for coming off rude. I did want to after I said it but he was just talking to someone else and I just wanted to finish my workout. I will apologize next week. Thanks man", "Not overbearing anymore. Interesting point. What is the theory on that one?", "I get it. I will apologize when I see him next.", "Would your answer be the same if the trainer noticed Op has horrible form and had higher injury risk for it? I see people all the time with horrendous squad form", "Exactly!", "Wtf? What gym do you go to? I don't think gym management is gonna warn me because I didn't want to listen to unsolicited advice. I never cursed at him, was just rude. Yes. I will admit to that.", "It's perfect, obviously.", "Right? Jesus christ what a nightmare. I am so sorry.", "I have short limbs too. Also a long torso. Shit just works out differently for me too. I agree with this.", "I will regert it so bad.", "I have a huge chip on my shoulder. Bad experiences with other folks growing up, so I have developed a massive asshole shell. I do plan on apologizing next week because I do want to continue to go to my gym without animosity.", "And that\u2019s just it. If you are doing things in proper form you get a \u201clooks good\u201d or a nod. When doing something wrong you get a \u201chey can I give you some advice?\u201d  \n\nNothing frustrates me more at the gym than someone who thinks they know what they are doing but have horrible form and are going to hurt themselves.", "two words, actually. good try buddy", "No, you can have boundaries and still be respectful of others. Otherwise you are just an AH. YTA. Being rude isn\u2019t a personality.", "\"Rude\" and \"has boundaries\" aren't the same thing tho.", "\"Literal randoms\"? You mean the other people at the gym who likely have a similar schedule to you and will see you often for who knows how long?\n\nYeah why would I ever show those \"literall randoms\" any respect or courtesy. It's not like if I ever actually want some advice on a new machine I'd ever have to ask one of those \"literal randoms\" how to use it. And since they are \"literal randoms\" they won't have any clue as to how rude and abrasive I am to every single person I've ever interact with at the gym.\n\nThere's a dude who is incredibly rude to the staff and other gym goers at my gym. We all know him. We all dislike him and wish he would go to a different gym.\n\nBy the way it's people. The word you are looking for isn't \"literal randoms\", it's people, you disrespectful small person", "You sound like a spoilt child. Been polite to others is basic human decency. Grow up", "You don't have to be polite to people you don't know, but that does make you an asshole", "I am a dude?", "I bet you\u2019re fun at parties", "Uh... Kind of... I'm not an anti social person. Also there's a difference between someone approaching you to ask for something and approaching you to genuinely offer you something.\n\nYou didn't rub me up the wrong way, but you probably did that to the guy who offered you genuine help.\n\nAlso, it's one thing to refuse help from someone who knows what they are doing (dumb, but your choice), it's another to refuse it so rudely, especially when you're in a place where your going to see this guy a lot.\n\nMaybe you just lack some serious social skills? Trust problems? I don't fucking know. You came here for our opinion and you're still being a dick.", "You sound like TA right now even in these comments \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 YTA I bet you were unnecessarily rude.", "Agreed", "How do you know if it wouldn\u2019t? You didn\u2019t need to be rude. Seriously grow up.", "Most trainers I've seen are nonchalant about gym goers who aren't their personal clients. The good trainers make sure no one is getting injured at the gym, beginner or advanced.", "So do most people. Doesn't mean it's OK to be an asshole to someone. \n\nIt's this person's job to go around the gym and offer advice to clients. Don't be a dick to someone who is just doing their job.", "OP was def rude, but isn\u2019t that an even CLEARER indication that the trainer shouldn\u2019t have asked again? \n\nYou might\u2019ve just said that to highlight OP being an AH which I agree with", "That trainer is one of the good ones. A bad trainer would not pay attention to his surroundings and let people hurt themselves when he could've prevented it.", "I don't think you know what passive aggressive means. I was direct in my response, which is the opposite of passive aggression.", "Oh because you were there and saw the whole thing? Or you workout with me and know how my form looks? Or maybe you're some world class weight lifter? Please give me some advice on my squat, I will send you a video.", "They didn\u2019t let the person give the advice. \n\nKind of short sighted to not let the \u201cexpert\u201d (and I know some people aren\u2019t trained but sounds like this guy knew his stuff) tell them something that may save them an injury in the future or help them get better at something they seem to be working on. You can listen to unsolicited advice and then not give two shits and do your own thing anyways. \n\nBut then again maybe OP is already perfect and nothing anyone says will help them?", "*yawns*", "Probably the best response here. You are right.", "I do have one actually.", "Difference between someone talking to you and someone saying \"cAn I GiVe yOu sOmE aDvIcE????\"", "Thats foolish. Try passing that course and get back us if you're so much smarter.", "You're pretty triggered here, I'm thinking your version of events might not quite be accurate in the original post.", "Just so you know doing something wrong doesn\u2019t make you less than. Being unwilling to accept that you may be wrong and unwilling to learn from others does (especially when they\u2019re paid to give said advice but were giving it for free)\n\nThat\u2019s unsolicited advice, have a good day!", "Actually, I work out regularly with a trainer. So yeah my form is good and I do listen to the advice of others and either adjust to include it or ignore it if it goes against what I already know\u2026..but I do listen. \n\nOh and I used to be ranked player in my sport, so I have done a lot of training at different levels in gyms. \n\nYou\u2019re an ass and really don\u2019t want to hear what Reddit has to say, so why ask?", "Bro chill", "Your replies make you sound like a massive asshole. YTA just based on the attitude you present here, because I can't imagine how insufferable you are in person if this is how you act.", "Haha I was on your side until this response. Triggered much, bro?", "YTA.", "YTA. Already thought you were from the \"I would have asked you if I wanted advice\" which just feels petty and rude when just the \"no thank you\" is plenty and based on what they said would have ended the conversation, but this confirms it", "You mad bro?\ud83d\ude44", "Yeah, YTA. This wasn\u2019t a rando, it was a gym employee. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a critique of how your form looks, but a trick or cue that you can use to lift even more.", "\"Taking advice\" whether solicited or unsolicited means accepting and acting on it, not forcibly removing advice from someone else's possession", "Yup I am.", "boy you're insufferable hfj", "OP seems like a very standoff-ish person.", "It\u2019s literally the nicest way possible to approach someone. Especially when they probably believed you were doing something wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s not unsolicited as they were asking for your consent. You refused it which is fine, but it was really not rude. \n\nI get that just starting conversation with someone might be annoying, but there was no malicious intent, quite the opposite so I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s such a big deal for you. \n\nIt\u2019s a gym, advice is appreciated most of the time because you can fuck your back up for the rest of your life if you\u2019re doing squats or deadlifts wrong. So cut that Trainer some slack.", "I assumed the OP is a dude cause the name, but maybe not. \n\nI get what you\u2019re saying about women at the gym, but this is also literally why I have avoided pointing out very poor form in the gym to women I don\u2019t know.  I try to just pull my hat down and turn on the music. \n\nI said it could backfire. It could just be about some trainer trying to get a client. -But- It could also be some trainer wanting to point out something that could cause you harm. Risk reward is high on the reward on this one. You can tell the guy you\u2019re not interested if he goes into a sales pitch.\n\nEdit:  Grammar", "While in general I agree with you that the kind of \"advice\" most men give to women in the gym is bullshit excuses this was actually a trainer employed by the gym who stated some pretty solid credentials. Why trust them? Because it's their place of employment and it's unlikely they would lie about their skillset, because it's why they were hired. Generally yes, it's not a good idea to cold approach someone with unsolicited advice. But in this situation it seems like they were just doing their job by trying to prevent injuries and helping others in the gym. So this guy does actually deserve the assumption of positive intent.", "Agreed, he sounds like a typical angry gym bro hahaha. I bet he really needed the advice!", "No you chill.", "Thank you! I try!", "I am.", "Exactly yes. Even a minor injury while squatting can fuck shit up and mess up qualify of life permanently. The trainer was probably very concerned if he walked up and asked him twice. Its much better than trainers i've seen who don't care and let people hurt themselves because its \"not their client\". \n\nAnd to the other guy, Op said he's a guy. Why do people always bring up the \"creeps & women\" dynamic every time people are talking about the gym. Its irrelevant to this discussion.", "K... Why did you post to be judged if you aren't open to judgment?", "you're not on mean girls movie, you're not slaying like you think you are. i wonder if you're like this in real life too", "that\u2019s good for you, just know that people aren\u2019t going to like you. at least you\u2019re proud of being an asshole, but why come to an AH subreddit if you already know you\u2019re a dick for no reason?"]}
