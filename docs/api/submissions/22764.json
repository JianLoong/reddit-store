I was training for a marathon, probably around mile 18 of a 20-mile run. Some 20-something kid on the trail came up to me and just started telling me how I was slouching and I should stand up straighter. Frak you, punk.\n\nTHAT'S unsolicited advice. A gym trainer asking if he can give you some input? You could have simply said a polite \"no thank you\" but the whole \"if I wanted advice I would have asked\" is just being a dick. Get over yourself. YTA", "I mean, kinda?  He might have noticed something potentially dangerous about your form and just wanted to let you know.  Oftentimes we can lift not even realizing our feet are turned in, our back is too far forward, etc. I might have listened to it and then made the assessment if he was coming at me from a mansplaining angle, or if he was just trying to legitimately be helpful.", "This is a person trainer he\u2019s likely giving you advice because you might be doing something wrong or something that could cause you an injury it\u2019s not some random person who\u2019s not trained giving you advice. I can understand unsolicited advice from a gymbro, but this guy would be able to help you. Just listen and if you don\u2019t agree with it then just don\u2019t do it.", "NAH\n\nHe offered you advice, you declined, he went away. That\u2019s it. By what I understood, nobody called you an AH for it, so what\u2019s the problem?", "YTA, not for not wanting advice, but for the way you responded. A simple no thank you would have been sufficient. You responded in an unnecessarily rude way. Learn some manners.", "YTA. I was going to say N A H because this entire exchange was just such a non-issue, but you come across as rude unfortunately (post + comments).", "YTA. Declining is one thing, but you got sassy with it", "Why would you refuse someone who's trying to help you, so rudely? What is wrong with you?\n\nYTA.", "YTA - He DIDN'T give unsolicited advice! He politely asked if you were open to advice since he has professional expertise in the gym. You then very rudely declined. A simple \"No thanks\" would have been fine and put you firming in the n t a category as of course it is your right to decline advice, but you decided to be rude. Giving unsolicited advice would be walking up to you and giving you the advice.", "It's not unsolicited advice if he asked you beforehand.\nYou were being rude for no reason. YTA.", "NAH. You were asked, you said no. That's okay! Also maybe gym bro can talk to the trainer if he is so damned respected.

But definitely NAH", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nYou have the right to refuse unsolicited advice, especially at the gym. It's your workout, and you should feel comfortable doing it your way. Politely declining the trainer's offer was reasonable, and you didn't owe him an explanation for your decision.

If this person was a trainer at the gym, it is literally their _job_ to offer to help customers.\n\nI've been the new guy at the gym who was offered pointers by staff and I was _really glad they offered_. It's fine that you didn't want their help, but speaking to them like that isn't OK. Would you speak to somebody working in a store or a restaurant that way?\n \nYour title says \"for not taking\" unsolicited advice, but that's not really the issue.", "I don't know if you were technically TA.  But you were ridiculous to pass up good advice.  Good advice can elevate your results and prevent injury.  No idea why you'd be so stubborn and arrogant.", "NAH. I'll be honest, I think 'No thank you. If I wanted your advice, I would have asked you' was a little rude. I'd have said something like 'no, but thankyou for offering' or similar. \n\nThere is a chance you were doing something incorrectly and that's why the trainer approached you; insurance an' all. I'd also point out that you weren't actually given any unsolicited advice; someone simply tried speaking to you. Not exactly offensive.", "I was leaning N A H but the PT didn\u2019t accept your first \u2018no\u2019 so NTA \n\nIn my experience the \u2018free advice\u2019 is normally a gateway to the sales pitch and trying to book you in for a session.", "NAH", "The gym is a community. You were within your rights to say no. That said, personal trainers are horribly expensive. If a PT offered me free advice, I\u2019d listen.

The unsolicited advice is for the best sometimes", "people (likely not gym goers) might say u were in the right but there\u2019s some gym etiquette so I\u2019d say slight YTA. surely u can reject any unsolicited advice but people at the gym might be the nicest u meet, and they often genuinely want to help (and not trying to belittle u pr anything like that). at least listening to what they going to say and evaluating it can improve ur form, and that is the reason u go to gym - to improve. dude is trainer, and was being nice, it\u2019s ur loss not his. saying u don\u2019t like unsolicited advice sounds like u got a bit of ego issue going on, which is understandable but the faster u ditch it the more u will grow", "NTA- but would it kill you to let the guy talk?  It is his job", "ESH.\nYou for being rude when declining his offer, him for pressing the matter.\nAlso, the advice wasn't what I would call unsolicited. He asked if you wanted any. Title is a bit misleading.", "YTA\n\nIf this person is one of the trainers at that gym, he may have noticed something that you were doing which was either ineffective, or worst case scenario, possibly dangerous to yourself.  You could have just left things at the \"no thank you\", but you took things much further than it needed to be.\n\nYour behavior will, no doubt, be noted. So if you return, and continue whatever it was that drew the trainer's attention, and were to get hurt; then you can bet that the trainer will have made mention to the gym's management that they sought to warn you but you didn't listen.", "NTA\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe", "NTA\n\nYou had the right to say no.

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a woman or not, but if you are and you felt like maybe this trainer was going to hit on you, I\u2019d say thanks but no thanks too.", "ESH. Neither of you were willing to swallow your pride. I don\u2019t know your squat form but it better be good.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your right to hear his advice or not hear it.", "NTA. No means no.  He's either trying to dominate your attention, get a sale, trying to hit on you, or some combination of the three. If he was concerned for your health, he should have mentioned you're doing something unsafe. If he didn't know how to bring it up after being turned away, he should have gotten a femme coworker.", "NTA.  You said no and he continued to push.  No means no.  He should have just walked away", "NTA. No one wants unsolicited advice. Only assholes believe their advice is so LiFeChAnGinG and important that to ignore it is risking injury or death. They need to get over themselves. \n\nIf you get hurt, that\u2019s on you. No one else needs to save you.", "NTA.. But considering you were doing what could be a dangerous activity in the right/wrong circumstances perhaps the advice would save your physical health one day?\n\nWouldn't have hurt to hear the advice then decide to take it or not.", "NTA but when you blow your back out you may regret this", "NTA, I do not believe all these people assuming that this guy was an authority who had your best interest at heart.\n\nFirstly, this works sort of like a neg. If a trainer wants you to trust them (not yourself) they have to make you feel like you don't know what your doing. To me this seems like it could be a way to make you think you need their help. Honestly it's a great sales tactic.\n\nYou don't need a lot of qualification to be a trainer, this isn't like not believing a doctor. It's more like not believing someone who comes up to you in the supermarket and tells you you're buying the wrong groceries because they're a wellness coach.\n\nAnd it's not like there is one way to squat. The last two highly qualified personal trainers I worked with, one said my knees needed to push out more, the other said I needed to push them out less. It's like diet. There are some real truths but there are a lot of facts where one expert is convinced you should be vegan and the other is telling you to eat more fish.", "Nta you have every right to not accept unsolicited advice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't go over to anyone unless I think there's some major issues in someone's form. I always feel anxious approaching someone who is training because I fear getting a grumpy or prickly reaction. I almost always begin with \"can I offer some advice\", I'm not going crashing in telling someone that they might break their back. I don't want to appear rude or cocky myself.\n\nWe pay a huge amount for our qualifications and if someone is nice enough to come offer some advice when you're not a client, then hear them out. The amount of bad form I see in the gym is never ending and I often freak out that someone is about to horribly injure themselves. Sad truth is people often don't want the advice or the help.", "YTA - there\u2019s no need to be rude, and it sounds like your fear of wounded pride kept you from potentially gaining some insight from an experienced lifter - not the wisest choice.", "YTA.

Nothing to take or not take.", "I agree, but where do you draw the line? Let's say that you see a person at a gas station that is not aware of how gas pumps work and has just gotten their first car? Statistically, this situation wouldn't happen because almost everyone has parents to explain this stuff to them, however, not everyone does. I, for one, don't know how to drive a car because I've never had the money to buy one, hence, never learned. If I do something wrong in this regard, unsolicited advice is very much welcome. At the gym, it's irritating, sure, but when someone genuinely doesn't know that they're doing it wrong and decide to wing it because they have no other choice, do you sit back and watch or do you help?\n\nNAH, first bro offered advice, second bro tried helping out first bro, third bro would have been TA."]}
