We both took it as a sign and want to keep the baby but my husband says he still wants to travel and asked if im okay with it. My parents said they wanted to have a grandchild anyways and wanted it so bad that they even said they would watch him while we go out and have fun before I was even pregnant. So I knew my baby would be in good hands if we still travel so I said yes. We decided to go through this pregnancy.\n\nFast forward to now, our baby is 8 months and my husband is an incredible father. He hasnt been anywhere since the baby was born but he did occasionally talk about where to go next to travel. I honeslty thought at this point that he should stay home and be a father because he's a parent now. He shouldnt be gone even for a day away from our baby. I told him this and he got a bit upset. He wanted to think things through about this so he asked for a little mental space to not talk about the subject right now which I agreed. But then literally the next day, his college friend contacted him and invited him to a wedding to Taiwan. He told me this and said his friend was the one to helped him go through a lot in his college years and at least give him maybe 4 or 5 days to visit there. I still said no because things changed. My husband exploded and said that I broke the promise I made while I was pregnant. He kept telling me to give the baby to my parents to watch but I said we wouldnt be responsible parents if we do that. He kept claiming it's responsible because we know the baby will be safe but I kept arguing back that it doesnt work that way and I can really take him to court if he wants to abandon the baby. \n\nHe broke his game system out of anger and gotten silent afterwards.

I\u2019m allowed to leave my children with my husband, a capable parent, to watch them while I visit with my sister for a girls weekend or for the day to run errands alone. It doesn\u2019t make me less of a mother. We as parents NEED to take time to ourselves to recharge our own batteries. You are going about this the absolute wrong way.

Like WTF, vacation is not abandonment.", "I fully expected to come in and read about how there was no family close by and now that they had a baby money was tight but the husband insisted on continuing to travel.

But from the sounds of it, he was starting to live up to them for the 8 months. Travelling to a wedding doesn't sound unreasonable, those commitments matter. The part that I would say was a bit too far is his reaction, exploding and breaking his game system. I don't like that violence became involved unnecessarily even if it wasn't directed at anyone. Looks like he bottled it up for a while, which suggests that you guys weren't really actually talking about it seriously with the intent to resolve it. But in any case, your husband is making valid points - you're saying rather unreasonable things, you are breaking your promise with him, and you're overreacting.\n\nThreatening to take him to court over this is definitely YTA move and the kind of thing that qualifies under relationship-ending if it were me; that crosses the line firmly into TA.", "What's to stop him from bringing the baby?", "Oh sweetie. YTA. You're a new parent so I completely understand the paranoia but the truth is it's OK for a parent to spend time away from their baby. I'd even say it's healthy. Your entire life cannot revolve around your child. It's just not emotionally practical. You need to still be you and your husband still needs to be him.", "YTA- wow. You broke your promise and expect him to be okay with your lies? And you threatening court over ONE trip to a wedding? It sounds like you need to find some help, either for some PPD or just some common sense therapy. Saying going away for a few days is child abandonment is absolutely insane? You understand that? You\u2019re throwing out these wildly untrue accusations to manipulate this man into bending to your will and threatening him with nuclear options. You need to see how toxic you\u2019re being to him.", "ESH Sounds like hubby has anger issues. You shouldn't have to threaten him to keep him home when child is under a year old. Are you still breastfeeding? Leaving children that young for a week with others even grandparents can be tough on the kids and should only be done if absolutely necessary.", "ESH. There is no requirement for parents to be the only figure in a kids life. Mine barely started to talk and was demanding we arrange her next visit to grandma. Being overly clinging to your child is only going to saddle them up for problems later. The two of you should both sit and talk this through like adults. Not throw tantrums like toddlers.", "NTA but hon, you might want to check into some therapy.   \n\nI don't think you intentionally broke your word.  After being responsible for a needy infant, lots of people rework their opinions from when the baby was just theoretical.

He wouldnt be a father figure\n\nVery soft YTA. This is a completely unreasonable expectation and reaction. Being away less than a week is not going to impact your baby negatively the way you seem to be implying. You said yourself your parents want to be involved and would watch your child if there was need. A close friend of your spouse is getting married and want him there to celebrate. That is special and is a valid reason to allow this trip. Additionally, you DID break your promise. Nothing has changed except how anxious you seem to be about separation from your child. \n\nThe fact that you don't understand that you're in the wrong here makes me wonder if you have some sort of post partum issue that is affecting your judgement. If you are really that anxious about even a single day away from your child you should talk to your doctor. Life can be unpredictable and you should not always expect that only you or your spouse take care of your child overnight. Besides, you and your husband should not be the only people your baby is closely bonded with when they have loving grandparents aching to love them and care for them. \n\nSide note: Your hubby breaking stuff is not good.

If you do not think other people who leave their babies for work, travel, etc are abandoning their children, then you know it's simply fear making you believe that is what your spouse is doing in the same situation. Here is a plan:\n1. Tell yourself it is simply anxiety and it is important to everyone's health and sanity for this to happen. Your child is eventually also going to want to go places. That is a good thing! Getting a grip on the fear now will give that baby a much better life later.\n2. Explain your anxiety to your husband and ask for some built in support for this trip. Daily facetimes, no joking comments that will make it worse, perhaps shortening trip by one day as a compromise, etc. Nothing crazy, just a few things to provide assurance.\n3. Set yourself up for success. Ask parents to help watch baby if you aren't getting enough rest. Buy your favorite snacks, find a great show to binge, etc. Make this a fun staycation for you and you baby! It will help (Single mom of two who raised them alone. I get that it's work and not a vacation for the OP. But it really does make a huge difference to simply change the view occasionally from weekend with my kid to staycation time)\n4.

There is **nothing** irresponsible about leaving a child with a sitter, relative or not, for a short period of time while they travel unless you're aware of a reason why those people shouldn't be around children. Parents travel without their children every day without problems.\n\nWait. Abandon the baby???

Your husband's mistake was to have a child with you, a controlling, using baby as a leverage kind of person. \n\n(4-5 days for a good friend's wedding, when one parent has a support system to back them up, when the parent promised the other one these things would not be an issue, when OP is already doing his very best about being a father, etc...)", "Cleared traveling prior to having the baby \u2705\nAmazing dad \u2705\nHasn\u2019t traveled since baby was born \u2705\nHas a legit reason to travel \u2705\nHas willing and capable babysitter options while traveling \u2705\nHas a wife who backed out on her promise and is threatening to take him to court for abandonment for a 4-5 day getaway \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nI\u2019m a mom. A mom who travels and has a well taken care of, happy and healthy kiddo. It\u2019s not abandonment when he gets to hang out with grandparents for an extended weekend. And I travel a few times a year (including at least one vacation where I tag along to wherever he chooses). Personal time as a parent is important, and if the kid is happy and healthy in the care of someone else for a few days, let the man travel.\n\nYTA. Sort out the issues with your feelings of abandonment, apologize, book him his trip and tell him to have fun.", "YTA & A LiAR", "You\u2019re just... an asshole", "Ahahahahaha \ud83e\udd23 YTA - sorry to laugh but that's how freaking ridiculous you are. I could see if you had a new born not wanting him to leave for the first couple months but your baby is 8 months old and you said yourself your husband has been amazing. I'm pregnant and I have every intention of taking vacations from my child while they stay with my parents every once in a while. He asked for a five day vacation and you have someone who could help with baby. That's normal and it's not abandonment, like wtf! What's not normal is threatening the person you love with court action if they go to a friend's wedding. You have a control problem and your about to be a single mother if you keep this up. I would have packed my shit and left the minute you threatened me..I would be willing to go to court for my freedom from your controlling clutches..", "This has to be a joke right? You're 1000% the AH in this. Things don't just \"change\" because you decide they do. You're both in a committed relationship, your obligation to each other is to communicate and work toward a resolution. Not lock him down from doing things he likes because YOUR feelings changed about the situation.\n\nSaying that he shouldn't even be gone a day from the baby is ludicrous. Yes, being a parent can change the dynamic of a relationship, but it does not at all mean you can't still occasionally enjoy some away time. If you both trust your parents with your baby, then there shouldn't be any reason why you can't give it a try.\n\nYou both need to talk this out, and come up with some sort of compromise. Otherwise the writing is on the wall that this relationship will end due to resentment from both of you and your child will be the one who is hurt the most.", "YTA", "YTA. Obviously you' two shouldn't be together anymore.", "Why does it \"work that way.\" People who have babies travel all the time. A dfew days away isn't going to hrurt the child when it can stay with with loving grandparents during that time. Stop being so controlling, OP!", "YTA.  And abusive for threatening to take him to court for this scenario", "YTA", "YTA and I'm all seriousness you need to go to a therapist you have a condition that is not healthy for you, the baby, or your husband. Good news is it's not terribly uncommon and can be worked on. Bad news, it's not IF but WHEN this will cause your marriage to end of you don't work on it.\n\nMy guess is your issue isn't postpartum but more related to your husband traveling alone and you have a great he might not come back, wether by choice or die to misfortune. You may not even realize you have that fear. But it makes you cooking to him with everything you have and if you're not careful it will drive him away.", "YTA. You are trying to threaten the person you love into being someone they are not. You are framing it in a melodramatic way, he's not abandoning anything. You are going back on a commitment you made. \n\nNo one needs to be with their kids 24/7 to be a good parent. You can do other non baby related activities and stay away for a week, so can he. The world will not end. \n\nLighten up. And make sure you get time also doing something you love.", "Tbh\u2026he should take the baby to the wedding and leave you home. You sound insufferable. YTA. Btw, that\u2019s not how the court system works. Learn some facts before you threaten things. \ud83d\ude44", "YTA.  My wife was away for days at time for work while I was with a toddler and a baby.  \n\nYour parents ***raised you***.  You don't think they can handle a baby for a few days?", "Divorce. You think a baby will keep him?", "YTA, I may lean a bit towards E-S-H because of his reaction but you way more. \n\nHow is having a babysitter irresponsible? Are you never going to leave your kids overnight until they\u2019re 18? Do you honestly think you and your husband are the only people in the world who can prevent your baby from harm for a few day\u2019s time? \n\nI smell a helicopter mom in the making.", "I am pretty sure it is a hostage situation, and I hope Mr OP gets ransomed soon.", "I have altered the deal, pray I don't alter it any further", "I actually think the worst part is that she agreed that something like this would be fine when they had their conversations about keeping the baby, and has now totally about-faced to the point where she's prepared to make ridiculous threats to stop him from doing it.", "I\u2019m wondering if op has post partum anxiety", "I think if they sit down and think about the situation further, they will find it\u2019s not about the husband, or the baby. It\u2019s all about her. YTA op.", "This comment needs more upvotes.", "Breaking the game is bad... But considering she just accused him of abandoning his child, and threatening to take him to court over it, on top of saying he can't do something he loves, I can't say I blame him.", "She's mad because he wants more than staying home with her, and the baby she wanted so badly (and he was apparently ambivalent about) hasn't changed his desire to have a life outside of her.\n\nShe'd be pathetic if she weren't so detestable.", "My mind is utterly boggled. Do people have nothing between 1 and 10 on situations?", "I was thinking she should be checked for Post Partum Anxiety.  We really don't talk about it as much as Post Partum Depression- and people don't look for the signs as much.  It's hard to tell from her prospective if this is out of character or not.", "Baby trapped her HUSBAND with an accidental pregnancy? With a man to whom she is MARRIED? So wouldn\u2019t that mean that ANY woman who chooses to keep their child is attempting to \u201cbaby trap\u201d some man? That\u2019s absolute bullshit.\n\nI think OP went too far with threatening court. That was a desperate and asshole move. But changing her mind about her level of comfort with her husband traveling internationally (I am assuming) while their child is so young does not make her an asshole. She couldn\u2019t have known how she would feel, as a mother, until she actually became a mother. \n\nHowever, OP, you are going to have to learn to be more flexible if you want your marriage to survive. You need to listen to each other; not command each other. And quite honestly, 4 or 5 days is a very short trip. You may need to lean on your parents a bit if you need help. But what your husband is currently asking is not unreasonable.", "Seconding this recommendation. I got PPD when I stopped breastfeeding, rather than right after the baby was born. The pediatrician was no longer screening me, because the baby was like 9 or 10 months old. Hormone changes make things weird. OP should talk to her doctor.", "We don't know any details about how he broke it. It's entirely possible that it was a complete accident, like he was holding the controller and threw his arms up in frustration and the thing slipped out of his hand.", "Clearly not mature enough to be a parent. YTA.", "She seems to think she can use the baby (edit: the baby she always wanted, but he was ambivalent about) to force her husband to give up something he's always loved, and she's only temporarily tolerated.\n\nShe comes across as manipulative. To the extent of getting pregnant to sabotage her husband's hobbies? IDK.\n\nBut he may well be considering co-parenting without staying married, and he wouldn't be insane to do so.", "Honestly, I get things change a lot when having a baby, and thought the agreement about traveling basically before was absurd because it doesn\u2019t acknowledge what having a kid is like. \n\nBut then she went the complete other way, and oof, she clearly wasn\u2019t ready for being a parent.", "THANK YOU!!!! OP is definitely the AH", "Thinking 'I'll be fine leaving my baby for a week' before you birth a baby and have a tidal wave of bonding hormones flush through you, and thinking it after are totally different things.  I 100% thought I would be fine leaving my baby for a vacation before I gave birth, and I also thought I would be fine not breastfeeding, but man those hormones got me and I became super hyper focused on keeping my supply up - which made it hard to be away from the baby even if I was capable of leaving him for a night (which i was not).  The first year can be a really hard time to be away for a mother- and you do not always see that coming.  I can definitely see where the prospective shift happened.  A theoretical baby and a tiny helpless darling that is the most important thing in the entire world feel very different.\n\nThat being said, she went way to far when she threatened him like that.  I knew my prospective had shifted and I never expected my husband to be as controlled by new parent hormones as I was.  If she's not comfortable going that is fine, but blocking him for only 5 days is not ok if her parents can help her while he's gone (if he was gonna be gone a month I would think different). \n\nProbably she needs to talk to her doctor, she could have post partum anxiety (I had that real bad and it did not help with the vacation taking) or something else.  She might want to warm up with a night away from the baby, then a weekend, see how she does.  But if she's not comfortable doing that until he's over a year that is fine too - her prerogative, but she doesn't get to pick for her husband.", "I mean it is important to be flexible and reconsider a position if circumstance changed. But here nothing changed but op - its not like baby is sick or disabled.\n\nI don't understand why they can't travel together with the baby.  Baby flies free, will sleep most of the way (especially if you breastfeed) and will adjust to the time change better than an older child. I don't get people who think life ends when you have k7ds and you can't do fun stuff as a family.", "Life changes when kids come along. She\u2019s overreacting certainly but at the same time he can\u2019t expect life to go on as before once the baby comes along. People who think they\u2019re lives won\u2019t change soon realise the reality.", "Also - how is it irresponsible to have her own parents watch her baby? They clearly really want to.", "People also make promises based on how they think parenthood will be, only to find out it's very different. Still, that's on OP. She made a promise based on a reservation he had about an accidental pregnancy. She doesn't get to act like he's out of line for holding her to her word.", "Exactly!  She needs to understand that as a family, they embrace the things that they enjoy as a family.  Her husband loves to travel.  So they should travel.\n\nSidenote:  I found having a baby/toddler in Europe was the secret to opening all doors with Europeans.  Most nations love babies and it gives you something to talk about with all the other parents.\n\nIf she isn't willing to experience the Once in a Lifetime adventure of an Asian wedding by either taking the baby or leaving the baby, she will be the poorer for it.", "Honestly, this part just felt like she was way too anxious and she needed help because it\u2019s the perfect babysitting situation for the first time away. \n\nLike I wish I had super involved grandparents who would have taken my kiddo for a few days so I could travel with my husband when they were little."]}
