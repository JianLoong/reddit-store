Unless there was a ban on water guns in place at the time of this incident, you did nothing that this neighbor had a right to complain about. You were not on her property, nor were you doing anything to damage her property.\n\nThis woman is probably a busybody who pays close attention to what everyone else is doing in the neighborhood and polices everyone's behavior. Every neighborhood has one. They generally get worse with age, as they have nothing else to do but keep track of who's doing what on their own block. You just have to see her for what she is and learn how to defuse her attacks without causing too much backlash.\n\nThis might be a good time to teach your children about busybodies and how to identify and cope with them. They will meet people like this neighbor throughout their lives. A neighbor like this can even be useful because they notice strangers and report suspicious behavior to police, which keeps the crime rate down on your block. \n\nIf you plan to spend a lot of time at this house, I might turn this into a teaching moment by sending your daughter over with some cookies as an olive branch for the minor skirmish that occurred as a result of the water guns. Teach your daughter that busybodies are part of any neighborhood ecosystem and can serve a useful purpose at times.
