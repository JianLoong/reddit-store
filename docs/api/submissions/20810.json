What if she didn't want to give your baby back? What happens then?", "NTA\n\nI'd feel uncomfortable having someone hold my baby when who when I told them not now started banging their head against the wall. \n\nI feel awful saying this but she just shouldn't be left with the baby, they aren't safe.", "NTA\n\nIs it a sad situation? Sure. Do you need to put your newborn at risk so as to not rock the boat? Heck no! As a parent, you get to set reasonable boundaries and this is absolutely reasonable.", "NTA If your sister's behavior is unpredictable it is not safe for her to hold the baby.  Your number one priority is to protect your child, not your sister's feelings. Your Mom is the AH for pushing you to have your sister hold the baby.", "Holding your newborn is a right that you and your wife have. Noone else. Fuck that. You are simply being a good parent. \n\nNTA. 0% AH.", "NTA, You need to talk with your mother and let her know that in no uncertain terms, will you allow your sister to hold the baby. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s a four-year-old and sitting in adult on either side of her on the sofa would protect the baby from a fall. She is a 19-year-old fully grown adult prone to temper tantrum\u2019s, if she were to get upset or frustrated she could injure the baby with out meaning to. Buy your sister one of those realistic baby dolls.  Surely your mother would understand that if something were to happen, she would never forgive herself and you and your wife would never forgive her, so why not prevent it from happening to start with.", "NTA quite frankly if shes prone to these kinds of violent outburts I wouldnt let her anywhere near a baby", "NTA. No one here is really going to know the extent of the risk of having her hold him, you and your parents know that best. But it sounds like the manifestations of her autism are fairly severe, such that she is not really capable mentally OR physically to hold him safely so I think your call was spot on, and your parents' objections are misplaced - I'm sure as long-term caregivers of a high-needs child, they may just wish others could accommodate or maybe  crave greater 'normalcy', but in this case it simply wasn't safe or practical. \n\nI suspect that as your son grows into toddlerhood, you may find they can bond and have a great relationship. It does not HAVE to include her holding him as an infant.", "NTA. Protect your newborn child. And screw what anyone else thinks about it. You dont have to let anybody hold or even interact with your baby at all if you dont want to. It\u2019s unfortunate that your sister doesn\u2019t understand why she cant hold the baby but thats all the more reason tbh", "NTA. You should address this with your parents though. What if your son was them and they made the decision to give him to your sister. Your wording made it seem that it\u2019s permissible, just not at that particular moment.", "NTA. Your sister doesn't understand how fragile a baby is. It's okay to both love your sister and not want to risk letting her hold the baby.", "NTA- I also have a severely disabled nonverbal sister and would not have allowed her to hold my newborn. I love her so much, but I also know she cannot be trusted that way. Luckily my parents understand her limitations and don't pressure me to violate them.", "NTA...You never have to compromise the safety and security of your child. Your parents should know better.", "NTA. \n\nI was expecting an N A H but your mother\u2019s reaction is selfish, out of touch, and concerning. It may be worthwhile having a conversation with her and your dad to try to ensure they understand your point of view and will respect it moving forward. \n\nAnd, if they don\u2019t, you need to be hyper-vigilant when your child is around them.", "NTA.  Your mother is not thinking this through.  Your biggest job going forward is to ALWAYS protect your baby, fuck what anyone else thinks or says on the matter.  As a parent, the kids safety and well-being trumps anything else.  Is it sad your sister has such significant disabilities? Sure.  That in no way means you put baby in harms way to placate her though.\n\n#Id also think very hard about ever letting mom hold baby around sister.  Sounds like she\u2019d pass baby in a heartbeat.", "So your parents watched and guided your sister to trash a room and then have the audacity to complain you didn't let her hold your newborn? I get wanting her to be included, but that's straight up delusional. \n\nNTA whatsoever. I recommend not letting your parents (with sister) alone with your child. Best case they'd say 'she held your child and he's fine' worst case, well not gonna paint that picture.", "NTA\n\nYour first responsibility is to your child. Your duty of care supercedes your sister's care needs and/or wishes.\n\nYou could explain the situation to your parents and sister together so they all share the same version, but it should be clear you need to make sure your child is safe.", "NTA - YOU are the parent now and your one and only job is to keep that baby safe.\n\nWhat would\u2019ve happened if you gave her the baby to hold and then she refused to hand him back? Or started holding him in a way which hurt him? \n\nIt\u2019s best that she knows from the start that she will not be allowed to hold him to keep the message constant.", "NTA - newborns are incredibly vulnerable. Absolutely fair to prioritise safety over everything.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to include that you don\u2019t want your sister to hold the baby because she has autism. You\u2019re the parent. You can choose who does and doesn\u2019t get to hold your baby for any reason at any time. Just make sure your wife agrees with you before making any decisions.", "NTA all do, no question. First, you are the parent, your say and opinion is the only one that matters. Second, you should NEVER put your child in any situation where you question the child's safety. \n\nYou did everything right and do not cave to your parents.", "NTA. Are your parents insane too? They are desiluzional af. \"It's only few seconds\" could be aesily that few seconds in which your sis throw the baby on the floor, and no sane adult would risk this.\n\nFor the future, i strongy advise not let no only your sister, but especialy your *parents* alone with your child, bc they sound like people who try to do this again behind your back, and then crying \"we did want no harm, had no clue it ended like that\" when smt happened.", "NTA. I hope you don't plan on letting your parents watch your child. Not even in an emergency. Your child will not be safe. They cannot be trusted.", "NTA, but also watch out for your mom. Never leave your baby alone with your mom (babysit, etc) because she will likely let your sister hold the baby.", "NTA. When my daughter was newborn, I wouldn\u2019t let anyone outside of immediate family hold her. Newborns are incredibly fragile and very susceptible to any disease. Handing over your newborn to someone who bangs her head against a wall would be like going on a date with Ted Bundy. Is there a chance nothing will happen? Sure\u2026 there is a slight chance nothing will happen and you could emerge alive. If you\u2019re careful and quick on your feet.", "Never let anyone with a chance of hurting you child touch them bad parents if you do", "NTA. I understand where you sister and father are coming from, but you have to prioritize the safety of your newborn over anything else. You made the right choice.", "NTA - Protect your child.", "NTA, there is increased risk she could hurt him by accident, if you feel uncomfortable with it that's okay", "NTA. I would at least sorta understand if the sister was a minor, but she's 19. She does not need to be doted on and be the first priority. It's sad and pathetic that your parents let this go on for this long. It is not AH-ish for being concerned for your child. Talk to your parents about your feelings and express your concerns. If they still refuse to stop and keep on pressuring, I would not say cut them off but just maintain a distance because this is not healthy. They are enablers.", "NTA. You know your sister better than we do, and you understand that she could have unintentionally harmed your baby with an outburst. What if she did hold him, but didn't want to give him back? There's so many possibilities. Three weeks is still very fragile, so you did the right thing.", "I mean... what if your sister had been holding the baby, you said, ok, we need him back now to change him, or feed him, or whatever, and she decided she didn't want to give him up? Is she now physically preventing you from taking the baby back? Running away from you?\n\nNTA, I feel for you guys cause it's a tough situation, but at the end of the day, the baby is 3 weeks old. There is just no need to put him in the arms of someone who cannot control their emotions/reactions much of the time.", "NTA. i have a similarly nonverbal brother, although he doesn\u2019t get violent, but i also often can read his signals better than my parents. your sister clearly communicated something was off, your parents ignored it, and then got mad at YOU for handling the situation correctly.", "NTA. I\u2019m autistic and can confirm that you absolutely are not the asshole. Given that she has frequent outbursts and I\u2019m guessing she also has learning difficulties, it\u2019s not safe for her to hold the wean. It\u2019s a shitty situation for all involved but you\u2019re in the right. I hope the family sitch gets easier for you and your wife! \n\nAlso, screw anyone that\u2019s trying to tell you or imply that you\u2019re being overprotective (you haven\u2019t said they said it outright but that\u2019s part of the implication I\u2019m getting from \u2018oh you should\u2019ve just let her hold him\u2019) of a literal newborn. That kid is so new that you\u2019ll still have the receipt in your wallet!!!! He NEEDS highly protective parents rn!! You\u2019re doing a great job.", "NTA.  When visiting, look for times when your sister is calm. Allow her to sit quietly next to you. Work up to allowing her to gently pet the baby's tummy while you guide your sister's hand. But foremost, pay attention to your gut. There's a chance she really doesn't understand the situation.  You might even get her a doll of her own if she doesn't have one, and she can sit across from you holding her doll while you hold your baby.  Watch to see if she even shows any interest in either the doll or the baby on her own, without coaching from your parents.", "NTA. Hell no.", "NTA. i have a similarly nonverbal brother, although he doesn\u2019t get violent, but i also often can read his signals better than my parents. your sister clearly communicated something was off, your parents ignored it, and then got mad at YOU for handling the situation correctly.", "NTA. Your mom is ignoring signs that could cause harm to your baby. You need to protect your child as harsh as that sounds. But you are doing the right thing by holding strong boundaries and making sure your sister is supervised at all times around your little one", "NTA. And at least for the time being, you can\u2019t leave the baby alone with your parents, because I personally wouldn\u2019t trust them not to go against your wishes and let your sister hold the baby.", "NTA your baby's safety comes before your sisters perceived feelings which are actually your mothers feelings.", "You saying that your wife \u201callowed\u201d them to visit tells me this isn\u2019t the first time they cross boundaries. Perhaps it\u2019s time to take a break from them until they can respect you and your wife.

Sure, but it would have spared you from having to deflect whenever it was mentioned that your sister should hold the baby. Plus they could have thought of a way for your sister to still be included in the spirit of the visit (meeting the baby) without having to actively participate in it.", "NOOOOOOO!!!!!! NTA. Do NOT cave. Your child needs you to protect him.", "Absolutely NTA. The baby's need to be safe trumps all others.", "Nta maybe send your mum this post and get her to read the comments she may see it from the perspective?", "This situation absolutely sucks it\u2019s a sad situation but your job is to protect the safety of your child 24/7 , you\u2019re not the asshole .", "NTA\n\nIf your mum wants her to hold a baby so bad she can get her a doll", "NTA\n\nHer behaviour is unpredictable and often violent.

Then boom a shark bit his hands as soon as he put them in the water and pulled him off the boat? Yeah, two seconds can change everything.", "NTA. Her immediate reaction shows why she can\u2019t hold the baby, be alone with the baby, or frankly be allowed in arm\u2019s reach or the baby. Protect your child.

Honestly, I thought I was going to vote differently based on the title, but you will know your sister's temperament better than us as strangers on the internet.
