What is the goal of controlling what she wears?\n\nYou mentioned the event \"at a nicer group setting.\" Is the issue that she only dresses as a hippie? She doesn't have era-appropriate more formal clothing?", "> I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I just asked if maybe she could spare one day.\n\nThat's not what you asked for. You asked her not to be herself around your family. There are plenty of vintage outfits that are perfectly nice, subdued, and appropriate for a formal gathering. It would have been one thing to say \"hey, this is a formal event, tie-dye jeans are probably not appropriate\"; it's another thing to say \"don't dress the way you like to dress because you'll embarrass me,\" and you said the latter.\n\nYTA. Apologize to her and let her dress how she wants. Accept her for who she is or don't make her do things with you.", "YTA. If you\u2019re \u201cbothered by the quirks you once loved\u201d then let her go and let her find someone that never gets tired of her being who she is.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to decide she isn\u2019t what you want. What\u2019s not okay is expecting her to change herself to make you comfortable. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her that she should have to \u201cspare\u201d her identity to please you.", "YTA you've known how she expresses herself for a while I'm assuming. It's not like she's trying to put on a show that's how she dresses and acts all the time. You basically just told her you're embarrassed of who she is.", "YTA. \nYou *do* mind. You\u2019re embarrassed by her, and you\u2019re not afraid to show it. And that sucks, honestly. Your girlfriend\u2019s vintage fashion is a mode of self-expression for her. It makes her happy. Who gives a shit what other people think? She\u2019s not hurting anybody. She\u2019s not running down the street naked or skinning Dalmatian puppies to make coats. She\u2019s having fun. She\u2019s feeling groovy. Don\u2019t take that away from her because of the hypothetical opinions of a bunch of faceless strangers.\n\nIt really, really hurts to know that somebody who\u2019s supposed to love you is embarrassed to be seen with you. You owe her an apology. Either work through your mental blocks or break up and find someone who shares your worldview.", "\"AITA for implying that the way my girlfriend dresses is unacceptable for nice gatherings with my family/ friends\" \n\nWhy yes. Yes, YTA.", "This won't end well.\nEnd it with her and tell her she deserves someone who's not annoyed by her quirks.\n\nYTA", "Yta it really doesn\u2019t need explaining why", "YTA \n\nI guess my question is - why are you dating her if you\u2019re embarrassed by how she expresses herself? And what is your plan for the future? \n\nBecause it\u2019s not just one day. If you\u2019re dating her and y\u2019all stay together for years, I assume you\u2019re going to ask her to dress differently any time something like this happens. And if she does, then it\u2019s going to become easier and easier for you to ask her. The threshold for when it\u2019s \u201cjust one day\u201d will get lower and lower. \n\nBut like\u2026 there are two big questions you need to ask yourself: \n\n1. Why are you dating someone whose lifestyle is incompatible with the one you want for yourself? Can you see yourself sharing an apartment with her, filled with vintage stuff? A life with her using vintage slang? If not, why are you dating her? \n2. Are YOU the best person for HER? Everyone deserves to be with someone who is proud of them. Who wants to show them off to friends and family, for the unique and special person they are. If you aren\u2019t that person and you don\u2019t think you can be that person,then\u2026 why are you keeping her from going out and finding that person?\n\nI\u2019m not saying break up. I\u2019m saying\u2026 what is your plan here, and are you being fair to BOTH of you?", "YTA.  As long as she is dressed, does it matter what style of clothing she wears?  She needs to feel comfortable  in her own clothes.  Nobody else does.  The way she dresses is part of her personality.  You can accept that, or not.   Either  choice  is fine.  Trying to change her is foul.", "YTA. \n\nYou started dating your girlfriend because she is different and quirky (ugh), but now the fun of being \"that person with the quirky girlfriend\" is wearing off, so you want *her* to start changing. \n\nYou could have just let her know what the dress code would be, and encouraged her to have fun putting together a fancy vintage outfit, but you didn't. \n\nThis is one of the reasons why many \"quirky\" girls hate dating. Because it's all fun and quirky, until it isn't fun anymore, and then the person you thought liked you as you are is now asking you to stop being yourself. \n\nDon't be this person. Either embrace Iris for who she is, or let her go. You have no right to try and change her.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re asking her to not be herself around your family. You are literally getting bothered by who she is as a person. Yikes.", "Oh, the quirky ones are all fun and games until you realize they aren't just acting like manic pixie dream girls to make you feel adventurous or like you're \"seizing the day\" and won't drop it when you get tired of it. I mean, I get you, if you came up to discover that her interests and her fashion sense are actually annoying to you, you're obviously well within your rights. But own it, don't try to change her, just let her find someone who will actually embrace her style. So, YTA", "YTA / how did you think it wasn\u2019t rude to tell your girlfriend \u201cbe anyone but yourself when you meet my family\u201d?", "YTA. I hope she finds somebody not embarrassed by her tastes and will embrace her rather than ask her to change.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you really don\u2019t like her personality and style\u2026", "YTA\n\n> In public, people stare at her and turn their heads usually in confusion. And I usually don\u2019t mind. \n\nWhy would you even be bringing it up if you don't mind? Seems like you're lying to yourself and it does bother you or you wouldn't notice at all. In fact, since you're probably not psychic, how do you know what people are thinking when they look at her? How do you know they're thinking about her at all and it's not just you projecting your obvious insecurities onto them instead of admitting to yourself that you're not comfortable enough with yourself to be comfortable with your girlfriend who obviously IS comfortable with herself and her life choices.\n\n> I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I just asked if maybe she could spare one day.\n\nJust for curiosity's sake, how many days have you adjusted how you dress to fit her lifestyle? \n\nThe proper thing to do is let your girlfriend be herself and if your family wants to be shitty about how she dresses, you defend her individuality and tell them to shove their opinions or you're both leaving.", "YTA. You are not compatible. I would suggest let her go because asking her to change who she is is shitty. You guys tried and it didn't work. Oh well. Now you know you need a partner less \"quirky\". Go find someone who you ACTUALLY love and she can do the same.", "YTA because the 60's aesthetics are awesome and I absolutely stan her right to live by that fantasy on a freaking daily basis.", "Just break up with her already before you squash her personality into the dust.\nYTA", "Let her go dude, if you don\u2019t accept her for who she is 99.9% of the time, she\u2019s not your girl.", "YTA-She can wear event appropriate clothing without dressing in a more modern style.", "YTA\n\nAsking someone you love to not be themselves even for a day just seems like a shitty thing to do. You would be better to just disinvite her completely.", "If you don't like her, quit wasting her time and break up.\n\nYTA", "Soft YTA. Not harshly TA. You\u2019re just really not as cool with her style as you say/think you are, as in \u201cI dig you, but I still worry about how you reflect on me.\u201d  You sound a bit like you think she\u2019s cosplaying with her wardrobe, not actually expressing her individuality and sense of personal style. She\u2019s not the issue. You are. I don\u2019t mean that accusingly or in a judgmental way - just that you need to take some time and figure out if someone who\u2019s that unique is a good fit for you (or you for her).", "Your girlfriend has a unique set of interests and sense of style. Instead of saying \"this will be a formal event\" and allowing her to interpret that as she sees fit, you basically told her \"you're embarrassing and I don't want my family to see me with you unless you behave and dress like someone else.\"\n\nIf you're so embarrassed by her, and \"bothered\" by what makes her her, why are you with her at all?

Wouldn't it be much more jarring for them to meet her one day and get an impression, but the next time they see her, it's completely something different? Not to mention, she would be a lot more comfortable dressing how she likes.\n\nJust something to consider. If I have to make a judgement, then I guess YTA", "YTA\n\nYou are dating someone who stands out.
