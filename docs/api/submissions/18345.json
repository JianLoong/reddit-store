What is the goal of controlling what she wears?\n\nYou mentioned the event \"at a nicer group setting.\" Is the issue that she only dresses as a hippie? She doesn't have era-appropriate more formal clothing?", "> I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I just asked if maybe she could spare one day.\n\nThat's not what you asked for. You asked her not to be herself around your family. There are plenty of vintage outfits that are perfectly nice, subdued, and appropriate for a formal gathering. It would have been one thing to say \"hey, this is a formal event, tie-dye jeans are probably not appropriate\"; it's another thing to say \"don't dress the way you like to dress because you'll embarrass me,\" and you said the latter.\n\nYTA. Apologize to her and let her dress how she wants. Accept her for who she is or don't make her do things with you.", "YTA. If you\u2019re \u201cbothered by the quirks you once loved\u201d then let her go and let her find someone that never gets tired of her being who she is.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to decide she isn\u2019t what you want. What\u2019s not okay is expecting her to change herself to make you comfortable. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her that she should have to \u201cspare\u201d her identity to please you.", "YTA you've known how she expresses herself for a while I'm assuming. It's not like she's trying to put on a show that's how she dresses and acts all the time. You basically just told her you're embarrassed of who she is.", "YTA. \nYou *do* mind. You\u2019re embarrassed by her, and you\u2019re not afraid to show it. And that sucks, honestly. Your girlfriend\u2019s vintage fashion is a mode of self-expression for her. It makes her happy. Who gives a shit what other people think? She\u2019s not hurting anybody. She\u2019s not running down the street naked or skinning Dalmatian puppies to make coats. She\u2019s having fun. She\u2019s feeling groovy. Don\u2019t take that away from her because of the hypothetical opinions of a bunch of faceless strangers.\n\nIt really, really hurts to know that somebody who\u2019s supposed to love you is embarrassed to be seen with you. You owe her an apology. Either work through your mental blocks or break up and find someone who shares your worldview.", "\"AITA for implying that the way my girlfriend dresses is unacceptable for nice gatherings with my family/ friends\" \n\nWhy yes. Yes, YTA.", "This won't end well.\nEnd it with her and tell her she deserves someone who's not annoyed by her quirks.\n\nYTA", "Yta it really doesn\u2019t need explaining why", "YTA \n\nI guess my question is - why are you dating her if you\u2019re embarrassed by how she expresses herself? And what is your plan for the future? \n\nBecause it\u2019s not just one day. If you\u2019re dating her and y\u2019all stay together for years, I assume you\u2019re going to ask her to dress differently any time something like this happens. And if she does, then it\u2019s going to become easier and easier for you to ask her. The threshold for when it\u2019s \u201cjust one day\u201d will get lower and lower. \n\nBut like\u2026 there are two big questions you need to ask yourself: \n\n1. Why are you dating someone whose lifestyle is incompatible with the one you want for yourself? Can you see yourself sharing an apartment with her, filled with vintage stuff? A life with her using vintage slang? If not, why are you dating her? \n2. Are YOU the best person for HER? Everyone deserves to be with someone who is proud of them. Who wants to show them off to friends and family, for the unique and special person they are. If you aren\u2019t that person and you don\u2019t think you can be that person,then\u2026 why are you keeping her from going out and finding that person?\n\nI\u2019m not saying break up. I\u2019m saying\u2026 what is your plan here, and are you being fair to BOTH of you?", "YTA.  As long as she is dressed, does it matter what style of clothing she wears?  She needs to feel comfortable  in her own clothes.  Nobody else does.  The way she dresses is part of her personality.  You can accept that, or not.   Either  choice  is fine.  Trying to change her is foul.", "YTA. \n\nYou started dating your girlfriend because she is different and quirky (ugh), but now the fun of being \"that person with the quirky girlfriend\" is wearing off, so you want *her* to start changing. \n\nYou could have just let her know what the dress code would be, and encouraged her to have fun putting together a fancy vintage outfit, but you didn't. \n\nThis is one of the reasons why many \"quirky\" girls hate dating. Because it's all fun and quirky, until it isn't fun anymore, and then the person you thought liked you as you are is now asking you to stop being yourself. \n\nDon't be this person. Either embrace Iris for who she is, or let her go. You have no right to try and change her.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re asking her to not be herself around your family. You are literally getting bothered by who she is as a person. Yikes.", "Oh, the quirky ones are all fun and games until you realize they aren't just acting like manic pixie dream girls to make you feel adventurous or like you're \"seizing the day\" and won't drop it when you get tired of it. I mean, I get you, if you came up to discover that her interests and her fashion sense are actually annoying to you, you're obviously well within your rights. But own it, don't try to change her, just let her find someone who will actually embrace her style. So, YTA", "YTA / how did you think it wasn\u2019t rude to tell your girlfriend \u201cbe anyone but yourself when you meet my family\u201d?", "YTA. I hope she finds somebody not embarrassed by her tastes and will embrace her rather than ask her to change.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you really don\u2019t like her personality and style\u2026", "YTA\n\n> In public, people stare at her and turn their heads usually in confusion. And I usually don\u2019t mind. \n\nWhy would you even be bringing it up if you don't mind? Seems like you're lying to yourself and it does bother you or you wouldn't notice at all. In fact, since you're probably not psychic, how do you know what people are thinking when they look at her? How do you know they're thinking about her at all and it's not just you projecting your obvious insecurities onto them instead of admitting to yourself that you're not comfortable enough with yourself to be comfortable with your girlfriend who obviously IS comfortable with herself and her life choices.\n\n> I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I just asked if maybe she could spare one day.\n\nJust for curiosity's sake, how many days have you adjusted how you dress to fit her lifestyle? \n\nThe proper thing to do is let your girlfriend be herself and if your family wants to be shitty about how she dresses, you defend her individuality and tell them to shove their opinions or you're both leaving.", "YTA. You are not compatible. I would suggest let her go because asking her to change who she is is shitty. You guys tried and it didn't work. Oh well. Now you know you need a partner less \"quirky\". Go find someone who you ACTUALLY love and she can do the same.", "YTA because the 60's aesthetics are awesome and I absolutely stan her right to live by that fantasy on a freaking daily basis.", "Just break up with her already before you squash her personality into the dust.\nYTA", "Let her go dude, if you don\u2019t accept her for who she is 99.9% of the time, she\u2019s not your girl.", "YTA-She can wear event appropriate clothing without dressing in a more modern style.", "YTA\n\nAsking someone you love to not be themselves even for a day just seems like a shitty thing to do. You would be better to just disinvite her completely.", "If you don't like her, quit wasting her time and break up.\n\nYTA", "Soft YTA. Not harshly TA. You\u2019re just really not as cool with her style as you say/think you are, as in \u201cI dig you, but I still worry about how you reflect on me.\u201d  You sound a bit like you think she\u2019s cosplaying with her wardrobe, not actually expressing her individuality and sense of personal style. She\u2019s not the issue. You are. I don\u2019t mean that accusingly or in a judgmental way - just that you need to take some time and figure out if someone who\u2019s that unique is a good fit for you (or you for her).", "Your girlfriend has a unique set of interests and sense of style. Instead of saying \"this will be a formal event\" and allowing her to interpret that as she sees fit, you basically told her \"you're embarrassing and I don't want my family to see me with you unless you behave and dress like someone else.\"\n\nIf you're so embarrassed by her, and \"bothered\" by what makes her her, why are you with her at all? YTA and it sounds like you don't love Iris the way you claim to, so consider whether this relationship is a good fit for either of you.", "OP, if this is who she is, and this is why you love her, then wouldn't it be best to let your family meet her, as she is? Wouldn't it be much more jarring for them to meet her one day and get an impression, but the next time they see her, it's completely something different? Not to mention, she would be a lot more comfortable dressing how she likes.\n\nJust something to consider. If I have to make a judgement, then I guess YTA", "YTA\n\nYou are dating someone who stands out. It's not your place to tell her to dum her shine.\n\nEnd it now, if your goal is to start getting her to change, now that you're \"bothered by her quirks\".", "YTA.

He wants her to dress \"normal\", because he doesn't want his family to see her in her \"mismatched eyesores.\"", "One of the better balanced comments here. Agreed.", "Vintage fashion is nowhere near sweatpants and flip-flops, what the hell. This would be an opportunity to wear one of her prettiest vintage outfits - 60s dresses are awesome.\n\nHe wants her to be \"normal\", i.e., wear some boring modern mainstream stuff that is not what she likes. Has nothing to do with formality or \"niceness.\" Has everything to do with boring conformity.", ">He said he didn't mind her outfits in public,\n\nDid he?\n\nCuz he called her outfits \"mismatched\" and \"eyesores\" and made sure to include that \"people stare at her in confusion\".\n\n>he wants her to dress nicely and \"normally\" (don't know how else to put it)\n\n\"Normally\" doesn't exist. There's no universal \"normal outfit\".\n\nHe said \"modernized\", which is different from \"nicely\" or even \"formal\" -- he's not objecting to sweatpants and flipflops, he's objecting to her entire vintage wardrobe.", "THIS. Exactly this. They're probably looking at her like, \"Wow! Look at that girl rocking that vibe and being her! I wish I was brave enough to wear what I wanted to like her! She's so brave and fashionable!\"", "Except he did call her outfits \"mismatched\" and \"eyesores\" and is bothered that \"people stare at her in confusion.\"\n\nHe *does* think her wardrobe is hideous, but he's too much of a coward to spell it out.", "I never said vintage was trashy or nasty. It is however the same Concept:  Style. \n\nSo 99% of the time he makes no Vincent's but there's rules to follow for an event and he asks her to honor those, and he's the asshole? Nah, I'm not buying it.", "He didn\u2019t ask her to change, he asked her to dress appropriately for an event. \n\nJust like you\u2019d ask your partner to dress appropriately for a wedding or a funeral.\n\nIf you partner showed up in a 1700s powdered wig to a wedding, I 100% believe you would not be okay with that. It\u2019s no different.", "Exactly! The sixties had plenty for formal options.\nJackie Kennedy was First Lady of the USA from 61 to 63, and her twin sets, tweed suits, pill box hats and pearls are STILL lauded as supreme chic.\n\nIndicating it's a more formal event is fine, insisting on a modern style isn't, especially given the context of his whinging that her quirks now bore him", "We took it differently then. \n\nBut I mean maybe OP reasonably expects her to grow out of a 1960s phase. Considering it is 2023 and she didn\u2019t actually live during the 60s. \n\nThat might be unfair of OP. But it\u2019s certainly odd enough behavior that it doesn\u2019t sound unreasonable to think it will end\n\nLike we all certainly expect our partners to change and hopefully mature over time. Like my drunken behavior at 19 in college doesn\u2019t fly in my 30s with a mortgage.\n\nLike i said OP needs to be willing to accept her or move on. But also asking her to dress appropriately for an event, is not not accepting her. It\u2019s wanting his partner to dress appropriately for an event.", "Yeah, the manic pixie dream girl is fine when she's down for reverse cowgirl while on shrooms... but when mommy and daddy come around, OP lacks the courage for his convictions, and it's time to Stepfordize the little wife.", "Absolutely, look at this as if he was saying this in the context of a girlfriend who just had a baby and was still wearing her maternity clothing because she hadn\u2019t lost her baby weight. If he was telling her to dress differently because her comfortable clothing choices weren\u2019t good enough for his family in that context would it matter if he used the words \u201cembarrassed\u201d? Nope, OP can stick his dick in anthill, his gf deserves an apology and probably a better boyfriend who appreciates her.", "a little aggressive, but i appreciate your input! i see where youre coming from as far as the embarrassment sentiment, so your reply helped me see that better. thank you. \n\ni want to clarify that you quoted me out of context though, im sorry. when i said that it sounds like he needs to sit down with her and talk, i was NOT talking about telling her how to dress. i was talking about the part where hes starting to feel bothered by things that never bothered him before. he made it a point to repeat several times that it was never an issue for him previously. clearly something changed, and he needs to understand what exactly changed. it can be hard to figure it out alone, and in the meantime, she shouldnt be suffering because hes trying to figure it out. communication is super, super important if you want any relationship to work. its healthy to be open with each other and figure things out together. all i was suggesting was for him to address this problem hes having, and discuss it and get to the bottom of it. it could be an outside factor at play, for all we know. it could be easily fixable, or it could mean they no longer work together. regardless, the best course of action is to talk about it. \n\nalso, i think youre making a small assumption. we dont know if the formal part had been addressed or not. we assume this is the only time hes spoken of it, because he hasnt mentioned bringing it up to her more than this one incident. but i understand what youre trying to say! i can agree that it can be condescending to restate the obvious, and is easily a clear insult to the person having it reiterated to. it suggests a lot of negative things. but i still stand by the fact that it isnt unreasonable to ask someone to dress formally for a gathering. its very natural to say \u201chey, we\u2019re having a nicer gathering, so dress formally!\u201d \n\nof course i understand that this situation is different, but its an event hosted by his family, so i would assume hes the one to tell her about the event. im making assumptions of course, but i imagine if he were the one responsible for telling her about this event, this is probably the same time that he asked her to dress \u201cmodernized.\u201d this is the part where he easily could have fucked up and genuinely meant to just ask her about dressing formally. we shouldnt assume that these are the exact words he meant to use and the intention he had. people say the wrong thing all the time. but i also dont want to assume he had good intentions either, because if hes bothered by these quirks and her style when he wasnt before, then its likely that youre right, and he just wants her to dress \u201cnormally.\u201d which is not okay. \n\ni just want to point out that both are very real possibilities. only he knows for sure how he feels though, which is why i included the two separate verdicts, depending on which he falls under. \n\nanyway, im sorry if this sounds like just rambling. its hard to put into words. regardless, i genuinely appreciate you taking the time to reply, because its helped me see a few more valid points from a different viewpoint!", ">He\u2019s not there, yet.\n\nIt sounds like he was originally attracted to her \"quirks\", but now the novelty of Manic Pixie Dream Girl has worn off and he wants to her to look \"normal\" so she doesn't \"embarrass him\" in front of his family.", "I\u2019ve never heard someone else say \u201ccollateral damage on his life\u2019s journey,\u201d I have used that multiple times to describe my ex husband (kind of short story, closeted, Catholic, military officer gets me to give up everything to marry him, 7 years later announces he\u2019s tired of being married, 3 years later comes out to everyone we know, but never to me, cause\u2019 that would involve taking responsibility for his actions,) and it does totally apply here in this case, the way you said.", "And best believe if he feels tht way now. Imagine him living with her will he be happy with all her memorabilia? \n\nWould he be happy if she wants those themes in her wedding or have a super vintage wedding dress? \n\nHave her drop off her kids like that at school because what will the other parents think?!!!\n\nThey aren't compatible and OP is an asshole.for dating someone he knows is like this. And who he met like this. And now all of a sudden wants her to scale bk on who she actually is.", "It is not \u201creasonable\u201d to get into a relationship with someone who very clearly enjoys a certain way of life and then expect them to change?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing immature about dressing a certain way, clothes or enjoying a certain aesthetic. It has literally 0 to do with who you are as a person and who you are mentally.  \n\nIt isn\u2019t \u201codd\u201d to live your life the way you want to, it\u2019s only \u201codd\u201d when other people think you should conform to their way of life because they think it\u2019s superior, or \u201cmore mature/normal.\u201d We only have one life and we\u2019re here for such a short period of time, and she\u2019s living it in the way that makes her the happiest. \n\nBeing a drunk in college and enjoying an aesthetic aren\u2019t really comparable things\u2026she isn\u2019t hurting anyone or herself.

That isn\u2019t to say you cannot like old music, etc. but this person has gone far beyond that. \n\nAlso way of life is a deceiving way to phrase this. This isn\u2019t the girlfriend being part of another culture. This is her recreating a time period that ended a lifetime ago and making it a key part of who she is. \n\nWe can agree to disagree. I don\u2019t think this argument will go anywhere", "I don't know if he's looking for Mommy 2.0 but he is definitely looking for someone Mommy 1.0 will approve of... can't date riff raff....", "Leapt a few light years to that one", "I mean, my point is there isn\u2019t really such a thing as \u201cnormal.\u201d It\u2019s a social construct entirely depending on where you\u2019re brought up, your culture your country etc. Self expression is relative and there isn\u2019t a wrong way to do it.

And if OP can\u2019t handle that, he\u2019s with the wrong person.", "Your first comment is utterly a pointless thing to say. Of course it\u2019s all a social construct. Everything basically is. Blah blah blah. Doesn\u2019t mean we all don\u2019t know what is considered good manners and how to behave within our own cultures? If I scream insulting vulgarities at you, you don\u2019t go those insults are just based off of what our society considers insulting. \n\nThere are plenty of wrong ways to self-express. You telling me that if you are at your dad\u2019s funeral, and someone is self-expressing in a very culturally rude way, you won\u2019t be pissed?
