Honestly, if my dad got me that stuff at 16 (or any age) I'd think it was strange. What father buys his teenage daughter makeup and fishnets when she didn't even ask for them?

He either thought you would fall in love with it after trying it on. Or He reasoned with himself that the gift was \"accepted\" once tried on to absolve himself from the bad gift. OR he was being a creep about gifting his teenage daughter fishnets, chokers, and makeup that is not her style and then guilting her into trying it on *for him*.

I get the feeling that you are often compared to your sister\u2019s fashion sense , and that your dad wants you to conform more. Largely I\u2019d say n t a but that really was rude. \n\nMy verdict is ESH - dad for being pushy and not adhering to a teen\u2019s list (when a teen gives a list you stick to it lol) and taking it personally when he went entirely against your known style, and you for well, I guess for being a teenager who hasn\u2019t yet learned how to really verbalize and balance these sorts of things.

Ask if you can get into therapy or counseling and tell your therapist.  \n\nI suspect that the reason you were so forceful in talking to your dad about his gifts isn't just that they weren't on the list, but comes from a sense of these gifts being inappropriate in a way that connected to some other experiences you've had, things that have been said or done that bothered you.\n\nI really hope I'm wrong about everything here, but if I'm at all right, please, please protect yourself and tell a trusted adult.\n\nNTA", "My dad taught me to act like you love any gift even if you hate them.

Should he have just followed the list? Definitely, but some people don\u2019t like lists because they want their thing to be a surprise. This is exactly why I have a no-gift policy on my birthday/Christmas. People hate their surprises being ruined, but often overestimate how well they know you and what you\u2019d like.", "YTA. Yeah that's rude and unappreciative.

You're 16, you can begin learning some tact. \n\nYour father's idea of what you would like isn't anywhere near what you actually like. \n\nI sympathize, really; when I was 12 my father bought me a purple turtleneck and bright red flared jeans for christmas... it was tragically mismatched to my personality and preferences. \n\nAnd you know what? I wore them. Exactly once as he'd intended - to a family christmas event - then after paired with other things - black jeans for the sweater, white shirt for the scary red pants. \n\nPick something you can use of the gifts, re-purposed for your style.

I just think opening gifts is one of the social decencies where you just say thank you bc who knows how long someone struggled to think of a good gift or even afford it?", "If I ever gave a gift and the reaction was to be told that the gifts suck, that would be the last gift given. How rude. You could have #1 said thank you, #2 explained that although you really appreciate it the gifts aren\u2019t your style.

I've got sweaters in my closet I'll never wear, a Yeti mug I'll never use, some of the girliest stuff when I just wanted comfortable things, and the list goes on. But damnit, he tries, and I love him for it. \n\nI'm guessing you love your dad, and if you had any idea how much he's probably hurting, you'd realize how awful your reaction was. That anger he's showing? It's hiding how terrible he feels.

I just can\u2019t see myself buying those things for my daughter. However\u2026.you might be right. I shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions.", "might\u2019ve been creepy to you but luckily they weren\u2019t your gifts. OP never said she saw them creepy either. people can see fish nets and chokers on someone and not sexualize them, especially their daughters", "no it isn\u2019t. the point is she said the gifts suck which is disrespectful. if they\u2019re something you\u2019re not into, there\u2019s more respectful ways of saying it.", "yeah ofc you can! but not like that\ud83d\ude2d there\u2019s many way to say it respectfully instead of acting like a brat", "I feel like she should know me better", "camo make-up to sneak up on the fish!", "Your dad's gifts are very disturbing.\n\nForget the stuff in your post.\n\nWhy is your dad buying you stuff like that?", "op herself seemed hesitant about it the way she worded it. she said it's not something she would have chosen for herself and that it's \"extra\". it's not necessarily the clothes themselves making it weird to me but the clothes AND wanting her to try them on, implying he wants to see her wearing them? that's weird to me.", "100% the fianc\u00e9 picked this stuff out.  I am sorry she didn\u2019t get your style right.  It sucks because it sounds like they dropped a lot of cash that could have been stuff you would appreciate.  Has either of them led you to believe that they disapprove of your look? Then they definitely suck.  But I think it\u2019s salvageable.  Apologize and ask for receipts.", "Imagian being the fish seeing a grown women in makeup swim towards u", "that\u2019s not weird to me but to each their own ig. i get the not choosing it for herself and her dad buying her something that she possibly hasn\u2019t worn before but maybe he genuinely thought she\u2019d like it? who knows. or yk, maybe he is a creep but we won\u2019t really know unless op says sum about it"]}
