I feel for your husband so deeply in this regard. \n\nI just want to add something here from my own experience growing up. My older sibling is my half sibling, he has a different mom, and granted kids can be awful, it was actually my own mother (his stepmother) that began teaching us he was \u201chalf\u201d our sibling, and where his bullying began. These things are taught, and that\u2019s something no parent ever \u2018wants\u2019 to own, their sole responsibility in their child\u2019s traumatic upbringing. It\u2019s not something my mother will ever own up to, and for that reason I have boundaries with her but, I literally can watch home videos and see the light in him change when certain people enter the room, and honestly it breaks my heart. It\u2019s sad to say my brother\u2019s childhood led him through years of drug abuse that he\u2019s just now resurfacing from, because he had no one to fight for him, which, sounds very similar here in your husband\u2019s family. \nWhat I\u2019m getting at here is, accountability only comes when the person is grown enough to accept their past, and that maybe they weren\u2019t always the best person, which, doesn\u2019t sound like something this MIL is willing to do for her son, especially since she\u2019s placed every ounce of blame onto him. How does your husband feel that his mother takes none of the blame? Is FIL acting just as oblivious? \nI applaud you immensely for standing up to your MIL, and defending your husband, honestly it sounds like you might be among the first people to TRULY do that for him in this regard, so I\u2019m sure to him that feels comforting. You go Glen Coco \ud83d\udc97\n\nTo be honest, these things need to come from your husband, to his mother, and even then, she may never accept/understand BUT, I think the healthiest thing IMO is to have HIM set the boundary, and let her know how he was treated was not okay, he will no longer allow the blame to be placed on him, and if that is something she cannot accept, then you\u2019re going to have to drastically reduce your time together to only major holidays for a few hours, and that\u2019s IF you\u2019re even willing to tolerate that behavior on those loveliest of days.\n\n\nAs far as those siblings, I\u2019m sorry to say but, that\u2019s another boundary I\u2019d set in stone, those kids abused your husband, his entire life, and your MIL needs to understand there will no forced relationship, ever, at any point, not even with the children his siblings cared not one ounce to introduce to their aunt/uncle. \n\nAt the end of the day boundaries suck, and I wish our parents were easier to accept blame and shift perspectives but, that\u2019s dreaming a big dream. I hope you find peace in this situation, as it\u2019s never easy coming from a toxic family dynamic but, thankfully your husband finally found the right person to have in his corner. \ud83d\udc97", "NTA\n\nYou defended your husband, as you should, whether it be his flesh and blood or not.

It probably makes it worse as you and your husband could feel like this is a hopeless situation therefore cutting the ties that bind you as family.\nAs an outsider not knowing everything...I can say I believe- if there is anyone in the family that can help pull these strings back together and bring the family closer, it is YOU and your MIL. Both of you seem to at least have some sort of interest in preventing this from becoming a chasm. \nMy advice would be to reach out when your MIL calms down. While waiting make a list of reasons why it would be beneficial for you and your husband to reconnect with family. The list should include activities you would like to be involved in, holidays shared together, and reasons why you feel it is time to attempt to build bridges. If you cannot come up with those reasons and feel it is best to keep a detente and space between you both and his family, maybe it would be best to put all your thoughts into a well organized letter, and mail it to all parties involved...sometimes speaking to each other creates more issues when a letter that is well thought and meaningful might be the best course of action.\n\n\n*Please do not rush this process  and please do it calmly while working with your husband.

( You seem to be a great strong shield)...and you are also his emissary...kudos to you!\n\n\n* Whatever course of action you choose does not mean it is permanent or the end of things.. sometimes \"time heals things\"...your husband his siblings are still young...MIL/FIL maybe need some time as well to reflect on the past. There is nothing you can do about the past! It's done and all you can do is look to the future. You both have a long life ahead that hopefully you can build something beautiful together and if the other family members are not involved, so be it! It's their loss! If they don't see it as a loss, build something so beautiful they will regret not having been a part of your lives!\n\n\n* I say this because I'm in a similar situation... mom/ dad are long passed...things between my older sister and I have never been rock solid nor close! In fact, we never spoke nor saw each other for 21 years. It was not a gap between us, it was like being in different galaxies. I used to fill out doctors / hospital paperwork and write I had NO sibling!  It took many years of silence and waiting for that moment when we finally decided it's time to put it all behind us and just try to be a part of each other's lives! It really was easier without mom/dad there anymore to look over our shoulders and influence our feelings. We made our decision to rebuild our relationship as adults and  we couldn't build that bridge overnight, so we slowly began to build a bridge using other family and friends as messengers. Remember bridges are more than just wood and stone...there are many things needed to build a solid bridge!  Friends and family were the string and frame for our bridge! Then when the time was right we finally took those awkward steps to meet in the middle of that bridge we built...it took us almost 4 years from the day that first letter was mailed!!! We never did apologize about the past...we just had hopes for a future involving each other... Yes, I missed many child births, birthdays, weddings, funerals, and family gatherings... But now we have a better relationship and it all started with a heartfelt honest letter... I admit I wanted rant rage and blame and point fingers in the letter- but I am glad my wife helped me to write this letter...there was no fingerpointing nor blame...because my sister and I both believed we had legitimate reasons to have zero contact it would be pointless to blame each other...instead my wife told me to tell my sister why I wanted to see her in the future...
