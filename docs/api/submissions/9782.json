No means no and it doesn't matter why. Just no. \n\nFfs I hate people like that. You gave a boundary and she stomped on it and then her husband backs up her crap behavior. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You are 100% right about not putting your child on social media. You are doing your job as a parent and protecting her. Your sister did betray you. You were right to be upset with her.", "NTA. You set a boundary for your family, made it clear to your sister, and she crossed the boundary. When you allow someone to be around your children, that is quite literally the most precious, intimate thing you can trust someone with. She has done something to irrevocably break that trust. It doesn't matter the reasoning behind your decision. It was *your* decision, she knew and agreed to the terms, and knowingly broke them. You're not being dramatic.", "NTA- a good rule of thumb is that you never post peoples kids, pets, private dwellings, or personal belongings without express permission. Your sister disrespected your wishes and you have right to feel betrayed.", "Nta, your sister sounds entitled and dumb! Everyone knows about the dangers of social media", "Not even slightly TA. Your child, your choice. People should respect that.", "NTA she should have respected your wishes.  That said, have you been screened for PPD/PPA?   Crying for hours seems like a possible indicator that something else is going on.  I\u2019d rec talking to your doctor about it if you have any concerns.", "Social media is dangerous for young people and especially children. You don't want to put your kids in dangerous place and everyone around you should respect your decision no matter what. Your sister didn't respect your boundaries when it comes to that, she crossed the line.   \nNot everything needs to be in social media and this is something every parent has to know and think about.  \nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYour sister blatantly disrespected your boundaries. You\u2019re well within your rights to tell her to knock it off.", "NTA. Nobody has a right to post pictures of anybody else anywhere, without their permission. I agree with your choice. You advocated for your child, well done! Your sister had no right.", "NTA. My aunt pulled the same shit.\n\nShe didn't get pictures anymore.", "NTA\n\nI made my MIL cry when I asked her to take the photo's down she posted of or children. We post 1 photo a year for family that lives far off. We choose the photo, no one else (for the record, MIL made an honest mistake, didn't protest before taking it off and apologized. I love her to bits). \n\n\nYour children, you protect them from perfetta on the internet!", "NTA crying for hours does seem a bit dramatic, but ultimately they are your children and your sister should have respected your wishes. I would be disappointed not to be able to post about my nieces and nephews, but I would never disrespected my brothers or sisters by not following their requests in reference to their children. Unless it\u2019s an actual danger or concern for the child the parent\u2019s rules should be followed. And if it is a safety or other concerns for the child that should be discussed instead; and then CPA or other involvement as needed if the parents don\u2019t see reason. But this is absolutely not one of those situations.", "NTA  Correct me if I am wrong; you didn\u2019t cry for hours because of the picture being posted, but because you felt kind of betrayed? I personally agree with your stance on kids and social media.", "NTA, the internet is a scary place. You have every right to be angry. She told you she wouldn\u2019t post pictures of your child, she did, and then she didn\u2019t understand why you were made.", "Definitely NTA! You're protecting your child's present and future. There are so many creeps on the internet looking to bring harm to children. Not to mention when your child is older in their teen years, they may not find the potty training photos or the ones of them screaming on Santa's lap nearly as cute as you did.", "NTA.  Your sister most likely posted the photo because it was cute and would get likes.  She could easily display it in a frame in her home and enjoy the photo that way. \nI feel bad for kids that have parents who are obsessed with social media. I'm not sure if I would have a nice relationship with my mom if she had 100s of videos and pictures posted of me without my permission.  \nI think it's amazing that you are willing to respect your kid like that.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be letting my sister watch my kid anymore. I also have a no SM policy with my child. My family and friends know that there will be absolutely no second chances when it comes to my child\u2019s privacy.", "NTA for not wanting your kid to be posted on social media. Your sister is an AH for not respecting your wishes. I totally understand why you would want to protect your child's privacy.\n\nBut, being honest here--you didn't need to yell and cry about this. That is pretty dramatic. Is this about the best interests of your child, or is this about you being \"disrespected\"?", "NTA Your child, your call. If you don't want your child's picture all over social media then you family better respect that. She could have easily covered your child's face to post that picture if she wanted to post HER kids. You are not the crazy one.", "NTA.  Learning that your own sister won't respect your boundaries is tough.  I feel like you were grieving for the sister you thought you had.  The one who would have cared about your boundaries.  People don't need to agree with your boundaries to acknowledge them and treat you with respect.", "Kids should not be on social media and shouldnt get smartphones till the age of like 14 period", "NTA\n\nI wish more parents respected their children's privacy", "Nta my son is 23, me and my fam never put personal info and even less pic of our kids - we mail or message and keep them private. Too many weirdos around. We don't even use our real name. My dad is a prosecutor who sent many evil people to jail and we share a very unique last name.", "NTA.\n\nYour child is lucky to have parents that respect her privacy. I wouldn\u2019t want my whole childhood online.", "NTA. I feel that some parents take this a little too far, but it is your child and you are free to make those kinds of decisions. Your sister should respect that.", "NTA. It's your child, not hers. Also there is no harm at all by keeping your child out of the public eye. I do hope that you first asked her if she might have posted it without realizing or something like that, and you didn't just explode right off the batt.", "right to likeness rests with the owner of the likeness, aka your child has the rights toi all of it's pictures.\n\nyou are the legal representative of your child and can thus exercise that right.\n\nthus nta\n\nyou can literally force your sister to take it down legally.  \n\n\nshe does not get to have a say about your children.", "NTA. WTF? You told her no pics of your kid and she goes around and does it anyway? I would be sure to watch her like a hawk around your child. She will probably do it again.", "NTA. Luckily, it's just one photo. Since your baby is quite small and has yet a lot of years to grow, it won't leave a huge footprint. It's honorable you want to protect your kids, my mom did the same when I was a child, but don't get too hotheaded about it. Don't argue, talk with her about it and solve it as adults do. It's not worth crying over. I wish all the best for you and your daughter!", "Definitely NTA - I have the same policy about my kids. I don\u2019t think I can keep them off the internet forever, but when the day comes that they choose to start posting about themselves, I\u2019d rather that start from a conversation about the choices we made and the hazards of the digital world and that they can talk to me if anything is confusing or scary and, most of all, there is no requirement for them to participate in social media if they don\u2019t want to.", "This is a tough one. On one hand, you're completely within your rights to want to protect your child from the potential dangers of social media. On the other hand, it's understandable that your sister felt like she didn't have to respect your wishes since her other kids are all over social media. In the end, I think your decision was valid and reasonable, but it's always good to have a conversation with your sister to try and clear up any misunderstanding or confusion over why you asked her not to post your daughter in the first place.", "You are NTA for not Posting anything of your kids. Thats your decision to make.\nAnd Posting a picture of someone elses kids like your sister did is a no-go.\n\nBut maybe i can sense a bit of ESH for Bad communication. It reads like you got really angry on your sister...Like... The-Big-Green-Guy way of angry with sending multiple messages at once while trying to call in and yelling (dramatically how BIL described it?) at her for a mistake she made unintentionally.\n\n\nEdit: As OP clarified in comments it was 100% intentional and that justifies a dramatic The-Big-Green-Guy response.

Social media is everywhere and there will always be someone with a camera and no sense of privacy. Good luck.", "NTA, it's your kid, but may I ask what the deal is with the social media thing? I see this pop up on Reddit and I've never heard of it in the real world, no friend of mine with kids has ever mentioned anything similar. Why do people not want their kids posted, especially since these are probably personal accounts with no following? Is it so strangers don't get a hold of them and share them in some way?", "NTA, I\u2019d have gone wild.", "I mean when they're a baby they practically all look the same and noone would be able to identify your daughter exactly like that at that age until later tbh. And it's an overdramatic thing to hyperfocus on the insanely rare chance of someone stalking her based off one photo unless you give out a full name too on the US. \n\nHowever despite my view you aren't the asshole. I wouldn't want my kids on social media past the baby stage. I'll take photos but don't want to post them on some bs social media for my family members irrelevant social media pages. I don't want to because I also don't have control over what they do with it or if I'd want it taken down. That's what parents do. Protect their kid.
