Your mother must have noticed it too.\n\nIt's a holiday home, so make sure whatever you leave there is old.\n\nAlso, you must talk to your mother about having your own space, (with a door, a door which can be locked) . Surely they have the funds to create a couple of walls an a door in the basement?\n\nIf all of this isn't going to work, a wardrobe with a good lock might do the trick as well.\n\nI don't think you have to \"babysit\" all these kids in your space is right, btw.", "NTA, you\u2019d be stupid if you didn\u2019t lock it when people are stealing from you.

You don\u2019t have the same level of privacy you would if it were your permanent residence or an actual bedroom that no one has any reason to go in. I agree with you that you should be able to secure your things, maybe in a locked wardrobe like you suggest, or just stash your things in another bedroom with a lock.

If you're able to, get a box you can lock (use a combination lock) for your important stuff. You're 18, so your parents may have another idea about expectations on how much space you get 'at home'. May be a worthwhile conversation to have if you're expected to move out, go to college, get your own place, etc. Some adults raise their kids to 18 and then are done with being 'parents' or providing for their kids.", "$20/kid/hour at a minimum.", "But still lock away your belongings.", "Id not even make it reasonable as it was forced on me (attempted to be at least).

I think that will fix your problem!", "Wait, you're saying OP's mother is stealing from her?", "That\u2019s the way.

There's no need for guests to go down in the basement, and considering the furnace is in your room, it's not really a safe place for the kids to play, so if anyone asks, that's why you locked it.", "If you can afford it buy a sturdy trunk that you can lock.  And a camera aimed at your space(that you only turn on when you aren't there).", "Please do that and you might look into some inexpensive cameras.

Someone is stealing from you; how is it rude to lock an unoccupied bedroom where theft has occurred, when the only people who could be responsible for the theft are in the house?", "Why not setup a temperature sensor and flood sensor? Monitor remotely and call someone if the alarm goes off? Or give them access to the app?", "The furnace and hot water heater or things like that are in OP's room. It's not a private area. She can't lock it up. The mother is in and out of it often as are other people.

When I babysat 12+ years ago that\u2019s what I made.
