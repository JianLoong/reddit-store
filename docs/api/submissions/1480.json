Does that person shush the kids outside? That's what it's like to live with neighbors around. Dogs bark, babies cry and kids are loud when they play. These are the sounds of normal life. Your pup should be able to bark to her heart's content when she's outside during the day!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This lady sounds a little batshit. She probably shushes children too.", "It sounds like you\u2019re doing everything you can and your dog is not barking excessively at all. I have two dogs who can be very noisy when I let them out in the yard to go to the bathroom. That 30 seconds they take to race to the back fence yelping like banshees feels like 15 minutes to me. I don\u2019t feel like anyone else is probably as bothered as I am about it. I would ignore your shushing neighbor and just walk your dog as you were. You\u2019re giving her a lot of attention and exercise and I think everything is probably fine. If anything you might want to look into a training class that helps against distractions and reactivity. Good luck and NTA.", "NTA.  \n\nDogs bark.  As long as you're not leaving your dog outside to bark all day I don't see the issue.", "Thank you! A lot of people in my country genuinly hate dogs so it can be hard to have a dog that is not perfect :( I wouldn't be surprised if that person also shushes children but I really don't know", "I have actually wondered if she shushes children too because there is a playground very close to our street. Also, in our community it is common for teens to have these kind of vespa's that are also ATVs? I don't know what they are called in english bur they are *almost* motorcycles and there are kids who have these who drive on our street. They are very loud!", "Thank you! She did go to a \"puppy class\" and it helped a lot! She was way older than the other pups but she still learned a lot (as did I!) And she got one of the highest grades in the class!\n\nBut this was years ago. She was waaaayyy worse than she is now in terms of barking, but she's not aggressive at all. I know I *could* train her better but the problem is that I would need more patience from my neighbours for that and I don't feel comfortable asking for it :/", "Thank you! Whenever my dog is in our backyard I keep an eye on her, and if she barks she comes inside immediately! She knows that she is not allowed to bark outside so on the rare occasion that it happens, she cones to the door to be let inside because she knows it's not allowed and I let her in."]}
