Of course YTA. You didn\u2019t feel like spending any effort and got someone a crappy gift.

Sometimes you just can't figure out a good gift for a person in time.", "NTA. You followed the rules of the secret Santa. IMO, a $20 limit is to not go too much over $20 and a little under doesn't hurt either. You're fine and your co-workers guessing who got what takes the fun out of a secret Santa regardless.", "NTA. No matter what you did there\u2019s a chance you could have been made to feel wrong by your coworkers. Buy something nicer and you\u2019re \u201csucking up\u201d, etc.", "NTA\n\nWhy I refuse to participate in secret santa events...", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s a secret Santa event at your workplace. It\u2019s not a major life event. You bought a gift,  your boss reacted appropriately. Move on. \n\nYou\u2019re clearly embarrassed about your gift. That\u2019s a you problem. So yes, you are an ah if you wanted her to be impressed with your creativity. Oh well... it\u2019s over & done with. Do better next year.", "YTA for being lazy and a cheapskate and hoping you weren\u2019t outed. If you\u2019re going to participate in Secret Santa, at least try a little. That said, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s forgotten about it now. Don\u2019t bring it back to work in January. Clean slate.", "Naw, NTA, and she gushed so you wouldn\u2019t feel bad, so if the gift receiver didn\u2019t get upset, shag the rest of the co-workers with their heads up their butts. You\u2019d be an asshole if you just didn\u2019t bother to get her anything. You played by the rules, and it REALLY sucked that they guessed who the givers were after the fact. That completely defeats the purpose of \u201csecret\u201d Santa! Supposed to be a secret!", "NAH - this is a mouse shut issue and everyone else has already forgotten about it. Stop dwelling on it.", "A soft YTA because you ran out of time! You really should have put in a bit more effort", "NTA. Personally I think the best gifts are edible ones, and you can\u2019t really go wrong with chocolate. Plus once it\u2019s gone it\u2019s gone, no reason to stick it in a closet or regift it or bring it to goodwill or anything like that. Could you have done better? Sure. But at the end of the day she got free chocolate!", "NTA. I hate secret Santa, especially when you don\u2019t know everyone well enough. Chocolate was a pretty good idea. If she joined the secret Santa after only being there for a month, surely she wouldn\u2019t expect something extremely thoughtful", "NAH but next year have folks include a few random interests. We use a digital secret Santa that does all the name drawing and has an option to send questions secretly to your giftee as a little nudge for help, it's fantastic and sometimes the q's people think to ask lead to really unique gifts.", "Soft YTA because you clearly put little effort into the gift and you spent less than the amount you agreed to. Next time don\u2019t participate if you can\u2019t be bothered.", "NTA", "YTA. You're clearly embarrassed by your gift... so you just should of gotten a better one. All these people commenting on how \"secret Santa sucks\" are bad gift givers. Next time, find a local small boutique chocolate shop.", "Nah you say 'under the budget' by how much?  $1 or $10?  Even if you don't know her well, you should have spent the proper amount.   Candy is fine!  A nice Christmas themese bath set, Christmas themed kitchen towels, Christmas themed candle, etc are all good for when you don't know people that well.\n\nIt's a work secret Santa, not something to get to worked up about.", "Nta \n\n\nA gift Is a gift and when you are unsure, food Is ever a good choice. Ever Better than crappy soap boxes.", "You're absolutely not the asshole.\u00a0 Sometimes it's just impossible to think of a thoughtful present in time. You adhered to the secret Santa's rules. According to me, $20 is the ideal amount to spend, however a bit less is also acceptable. You're alright, but it takes the pleasure out of a secret Santa when your coworkers try to guess what you got. If you're unsure what to give, food is always a wonderful option.", "NTA, and stuff like this happens and is not an indictment on your creative abilities or value.  I guarantee you that everyone else has long forgotten the Secret Santa thing.  Just make sure that next year you make up for it.", "NTA.", "NTA, it's a secret Santa, nobody should be caring about these things tbh. Nice that your boss got w thoughtful gift, but honestly, she broke the social norms. It's meant to be chocolates, wine or something funny", "NTA - honestly secret Santa is hard enough with family let alone co-workers. I don\u2019t know my co-workers well enough to buy them meaningful gifts. She didn\u2019t seem to care so I wouldn\u2019t let your co-workers get to you. I also wouldn\u2019t participate next year.", "NTA - First of all, you got hit with the triple whammy of challenging secret santa gift giving:\n\n1. the boss\n2. a person new to the workplace who you don't know\n3. you're a male buying for a female in a workplace context\n\nIt's a workplace minefield for this secret santa.\n\nChocolates were the safest gift to get making it the right choice. No, it's not brilliantly original but this is not the time. Something inoffensive for a woman you barely know, and the boss, was perfect. \n\nDon't sweat the $. Secret santas are about token gifts. As for your others coming up with better gifts, don't compare yourself to those who did not get the triple whammy draw.", "I don't think you're an AH for not knowing a co worker well enough after a month to get them an amazing gift.  I do kind of think you're an AH for putting it off (which is how I read \"ran out of time\") and going for a gift that far under the limit.  But is it really something to guilt yourself over? No.  It's Secret Santa, it's supposed to be fun and lighthearted.  So I'm going to go with NTA, but do better next time.", "The app we used this year actually has a shopping bit, where you can go in and pick gifts that you like.  Then, whoever gets you can choose from those actual gifts.  \nIt's linked to a large  number of online shopping places.  \nWorked really well.", "I think I might just be on vacation!", "There is \"nice generic present because I don't you well\" and then there is \"lame generic present because I couldn't be arsed\"", "This. She didn\u2019t even spend the budget. She knows her gift was lame and now she regrets it. Not sure if it makes her a total asshole but def a shitty gift giver.", "I don't see why a box of chocolates is a bad gift; I'd love it. And it is hard to get someone a gift if you don't know them. It just seems weird to call someone an asshole for buying a gift you arbitrarily decide isn't good enough.", "I\u2019ve never once been involved in a Secret Santa where the gift givers aren\u2019t revealed at the gift party. That is actually part of the fun.", "I guess. I\u2019m probably overthinking but now worrying that I\u2019ve made her feel \u2018unwelcome\u2019 or something!", "Why is spending less than the amount agreed to bad, though? The amount is a cap; don't spend more than X amount...not a \"you have to spend at least\" this. I mean, it's unlikely you're going to find something that's exactly the amount, so I don't see why going a little under is so wrong.", "Not exactly sure, picked them up with the groceries. Maybe they were about $10.", "Yes the problem was everyone got thoughtful things. Maybe I\u2019m in the wrong job!", "Thanks. Exactly what I\u2019d have said  if I\u2019d articulated it!", "Elfster? My family used that and it was so nice! We loved making our wishlists. lol.", "A box of good chocolates is a great Secret Santa gift. An \"admittedly\" generic less than $20 box of chocolates is a crappy gift. There an many, many types of good chocolates you can get for $20. OP chose to basically give up and get a crappy gift then had anxiety about it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOP, hope you read this - I think you had so much anxiety over this you froze and couldn't make a decision. You need to let it go. It wasn't the ideal present, but you seem to be fixated and ruminating on this. Have you tried counseling? \n\nThe solution is NOT to not participate again, it's to have everything write a few suggestions down next time. It's what ever Secret Santa I have participated in has done. I think it's kinda weird this one hasn't. Good luck.", "I can promise you your boss isn\u2019t sitting at home worrying over a $20 gift. NTA and stop worrying!", "I honestly wouldn\u2019t worry too much. You already said she\u2019s popular and you actually like her, so chill! Panicking over it might make it into something that it doesn\u2019t seem to be. You can always talk to her one on one and tell her your concerns! Like, \u201chey, sorry if you agreed with our co-workers that the gift wasn\u2019t the best. Hope we\u2019re cool\u201d or something and see where she stands. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re fine, but I totally get the overthinking bit", "A box of chocolates could never make someone feel unwelcome.", "Half is a pretty significant amount.  Again, it's a work secret Santa. Nothing to fuss about.  In the futute though, if you don't know the person well go with several generic but nice gifts at the $20 limit.", "That's very unusual, but you know for next time. It's not the end of the world, might become a running office joke but best thing you can do is:\n\nDon't worry about it  \nIf it comes up, laugh with everyone else  \nGet a great gift next year\n\nIMHO", "I never understand how up in arms people here get about gifts, especially among coworkers. No, you're not always going to get exactly the perfect thing you want...but c'mon, who cares?", "Yes.  I wasn't sure  we could use brand names here . But it worked out really well.  I picked out 8-10 items that were at or below our price. So the person that picked me had a lot of choice.  You can even email anonymously if you have a question.", "What a great idea."]}
