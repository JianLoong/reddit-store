He used to live with his mom. Eric and his mom weren't in the best situation. Basically, his mom would start dating someone, move in with them, eventually break up with them, and move out. Eric and his mom moved next door to me when he was just starting school, and the only reason we started talking is because the path he took to walk home is on the route I walk my dog. After about a week, we started talking and we'd talk to each other just about every day. Around 6 months after Eric moved next door, he told me he had to move again. From our talks, I could tell that his home life wasn't great and that the constant uprooting was negatively affecting him. I liked him and knew he could thrive if he had a stable home life. \n\nI talked to his mom about the possibility of him living with me until she could get things figured out, and she asked me if I would adopt him. Long story short, within the next couple months, Eric was officially my son. His mom pretty much dropped off the face of the earth since he moved in with me. I really wanted him to have a relationship with both of his parents but his dad was putting his wife and stepkids first (and being blatantly obvious about it) and his mom disappeared. His dad didn't even step up to take in his son and that broke my heart. He didn't see much of his dad. It was only occasional visits (and by occasional I mean like 4-5 times a year) but I was always civil to him for Eric's sake.\n\nEric's doing great, he's in university and he has an amazing girlfriend. I'm so proud of him. His 21st birthday is today. Him and his girlfriend spent the day together and I met them at a restaurant for dinner. I got to the restaurant, parked, and was walking in when his dad came up and said hi. The fact he even showed up rubbed me the wrong way. He only showed up for Eric's \"milestone birthdays\" (16,18,19 and now 21) and all he does is stay for 5 minutes and take a few pictures then he leaves. Eric's talked to me about it and he said it feels like his dad cares more about preserving his image than being with his son on his birthday. \n\nAnyway, I asked how long he'd stay and he said he'd stay for a little while, and, I'll be honest, it set me off. I said \"so you're going to stay for 5 minutes, then leave after a few pictures. We'll that figs not gonna fly tonight. Your whole operation's a sham. You care more about your public image then you're actual son. Tonight is Eric's night. Either you come in and celebrate his birthday properly or don't come in at all.\" Then I went inside. He had a hurt look on his face but I thought that was the end of it. We're at home now, and I just got a long text from Eric's dad. He accused me of \"taking his only son away\" (he and his wife don't have any kids together).

Your his dad and that\u2019s a role he\u2019s been deluding himself to believe he ever was one to him.", "NTA this dad abandoned his son...stop feeling guilty over telling him the truth. Proud.... that's the emotion you deserve....proud of the boy...proud of protecting the boy. Thank you for stepping up!", "A dad is someone involved in raising a child...loving them...supporting them. This guy was barely an acquaintance. It takes more than a few short visits a year to be a dad.\n\nOP ADOPTED Eric, making them the legal parent...and the loving parent. Biology doesn't trump being the person who put their heart into raising a child.\n\nNTA.", "Adopted dad he adopted him not fostered him", "I thought about this too, knowing where to turn up, I'd imagine Eric felt obligated to invite him. He'd already told OP he feels like his Dad cares more about maintaining an image of always being around. I think the Dad is more upset that he's been called out. OP has never stood in the way and has happily facilitated their relationship, he could have done more to have a stable relationship with Eric.\n\nI totally understand why you've said soft YTA.", "Ok. The son is an adult now and gets to decide and he did when he invited him to his birthday. You\u2019re right biology doesn\u2019t trump that, but if the adopted kid wants a relationship as an adult with their bio parents, the adoptive parents need to stay in their lane, it\u2019s not their business.", "I realize that. I will edit my original comment", "Yeah that\u2019s why I went YTA even though he\u2019s protecting Eric, Eric is an adult and could have ignored bio dad or not told him where going.\n\nEric is old enough to make these decisions himself now", "NTA. You hurt his feelings obviously but with a guy like that who cares? I wonder how often your son cried because his dad didn\u2019t care about him?", "My head is spinning! So, you were neighbours and asked for a 14 year old to live with you. The mum then asked you to adopt him.\n\nThe bio dad doesn't know you and still can't be bothered to take care of his own kid? It sounds like your son is extremely lucky you are a genuinely good person. \n\nIs this real? It sounds insane. If it's real NTA.", "NTA, I would be hurt too, but the bio dad did show up for this birthday dinner, so it is obvious your son told him about it. If son did invite him then you may have overstepped.", "Strange how there's no mention of a bio patent giving up parental rights to allow the adoption to go ahead. You sure they didn't just sign guardianship rights? Does Eric now have three legal parents?", "NTA. You are standing up for your son!", "NTA Thank you for seeing good in a lonely little boy and adopting him. It sounds like Eric will grow to be a lovely man. Deadbeat Dad can just suck rocks for his hurt little ego.", "I would've said some more and stay to watch him cry.", "NTA That guy is a narcissist, he's crying because it's about him and how you put a mirror to his actions.   \n\nHe doesn't love or care about his son.", "No you did the right thing. He threw away his son . You took nothing from him. Your only thought is for Eric . His only thought is for himself . Well done !", "Nta. You didn\u2019t take his only son. HE ABANDONED his son. He didn\u2019t step up when he had to have known you were taking over custody from mom.", "Or could have simply spent a couple of hours with his son in a restaurant for those birthdays.\n\nTotal crocodile tears for OP hitting the nail on the head.\n\nNTA", "Yep, this isn\u2019t a \u2018dad\u2019, this is a sperm donor.", "Yeah mom was more than happy to drop her kid, and give him to a stanger. \n\nAnd dad was just yeah okay i am fine with that, i have my wife and her kids", "NTA \nGood for you", "Your NOT THE ASS! Kudos to you for telling him like it is!! His image is of his own doing! You are the BEST father figure Eric would ever have. YOU ARE HIS DAD! I\u2019m sure everyone on this thread would agree! NTA", "NTA - he cried because he knows he messed up and got found out, called out, and from the sounds of things, chewed out. Good for you. If he\u2019s really upset, he needs to take ownership of his actions and do better. To quote a good meme I saw recently: \n\n\u201cI hurt you and now you\u2019re mad at me so actually I\u2019m the real victim here - a narcissist\u201d", "NTA. You\u2019re his dad and you had every reason to defend him.", "Screw that noise. I know for a fact that if that man was parenting his son, the boy wouldn't have been eligible for adoption. You haven't \"stolen\" him, his father threw him away.\n\nAnyway, you didn't even tell him not to come in. You told him to do it right or not at all, and **he** chose not at all. That's on him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You gave your son a stable home when his own parents wouldn't. You didn't take your son away from his bio dad- his bio dad pretty much abandoned him. Even now, bio dad is more concerned about his own feelings instead of taking the opportunity to reflect on how much his actions have hurt your son.", "NTA. Eric\u2019s sperm donor doesn\u2019t get to have his feelings hurt when he has been deliberately and cruelly neglecting his son in favor of a new family for years. You\u2019re a great dad.", "NTA: You are a great dad. Hugs.\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude42. Eric is blessed to have you.", "I know! What a way to clap back to OP's accusation, to just sit down.\n\nBut no, claiming victim status is easier.", "NTA. You were sticking up for your son. His bio dad was never a dad to Eric, and that's on him, not you.", "OP you feel bad because you are a great person. Eric's gene donors are garbage humans. He looked hurt because that is what the truth does. It hurts. I hope 1 day you get to tell the egg donor off too. NTA", "NTA. Good for you standing up for YOUR son.", "Can I just say that you were pretty amazing man to do that for Eric!! There are not many good people in the world, and you have stepped up to take care of this young man and give him a better chance at life.", "If dad still had parental rights, he could have gotten his son back instead of making up some nonsense of having his son taken away. That doesn't make the dad better. It's worse. He could have done more and chose not to.", "It sounds like that\u2019s what OP asked for (some type of legal guardianship), but mom brought up formal adoption. And OP refers to Eric as his *adopted* son, so it sounds like they went through the whole legal thing. \n\nWhich means, yes, biodad would have had to give up his parental rights in order for OP to adopt.", "Showing up at birthdays or when everyone's happy isn't much of a way to be a friend or a parent. The level of love and attachment is measured by sticking around when life kicks your friend or family in the nuts.\n\nNTA", "NTA you were able to legally adopt his son. In no world does that mean he was an actual parent to that boy. So he can cry all he wants.", "NTA. Your a good mam\u00e1.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t care about his \u201conly son\u201d.", "NTA\n\n> He accused me of \"taking his only son away\"\n\nOh, he has a son all of a sudden, it only took him 21 years to remember, but hey \"better late than never\", right?\n\nYou're more a parent to him than his 2 parents together. Parenthood is to be for your children for every ocassion good or bad", "NTA - I actually read this on reddit, \"if you wanted people to tell a different story, you should have lived a different life.\"  You are an awesome parent and human being (the latter is why you are are wondering if you are the AH here).  You gave him a clear choice.  He chose, as he always chose.  Maybe now he'll think about it.", "NTA. He literally could\u2019ve taken his son in any time before you adopted him. You were right and you\u2019re a pretty amazing person.", "NTA. I had a bio father like that. Realising we were just props for him hurt like hell. I kept trying to build a relationship and just kept getting let down in return. I cut off contact with him at a similar age to your son, and it has been one of the best decisions ever. You didn't take anything from the bio father, he pushed him away with his own bull.", "The son is only a FB/Insta prop. Tell the dad you'll send a picture of the son and he can just PhotoShop himself in, save a couple bucks. God forbid he should bring a present or pick up a check.", "Not to make light of the real people and their emotions involved in this but that would make such a high grossing Hollywood movie. Like the blind side but even more so. If its real, wow OP is an amazing guy and I am proud of both him and Eric", "Or he had lost them/signed them away previously.", "NTA. He\u2019s not his son, he\u2019s your son because his bio father essentially abandoned him in favor of his girlfriends children. \n\nHe needs to stay away.", "NTA. He is a deadbeat. Also, some hard boundaries might be good? I mean, who knowswhat is going on in erics head after these short visits....", "NTA. He is a shit dad and he should feel bad about that.", "Creepy.", "NTA!!!!\nYou told him to either come in and join the full celebration, or to leave and fuck off if he only was there to take a picture and run. He's married, and only shows up for optics. Hell, you adopted your son and he still didn't try ANYTHING. All you did was hold up a mirror to his shitty behavior, and he decided to run away and cry victim, as though his 21 year old son is a child that is being forcefully kept away. He doesn't get to try and pretend to be a good father, not when this is his only child and he seems to ignore his existence 99.99999999999% of the time.", "This happened to someone i know-biodad was a famous surgeon, just signed off his parental rights on his tween son.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for YOUR son!", "Insult to actual sperm donors"]}
