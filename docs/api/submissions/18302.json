What if you did get a dx. your dad's girlfriend will be happy with the idea that she spent so long teasing you for your disability? \n\nI'm saying this as someone who also has sensory issues surrounding food and was teased when I was a kid and my son who does have an autism dx. also has food aversions. The main difference between me and him is I was teased and he was not and he has a far healthier relationship with food than I do. \n\nIf your dad and his GF really want to help you be healthy, they should educate themselves about sensory issues and find kinder and more appropriate ways to do that. Vegetables are often a hard one for autistics because they don't have predictable textures, but there are ways to combat that that aren't making fun of you.", "YTA, their remarks were pretty tame.
