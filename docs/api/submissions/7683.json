Why does she think she\u2019s special in getting money immediately when the shop she bought lunch at today won\u2019t see her money until Friday?", "NTA. If your younger daughter did this, you'd treat her the same way.", "NTA and you should tell her that the reason why you wait to transfer the money is because she keeps canceling and then keeps the money. Why don't you reimburse her the trip money when you see her instead of paying in advance?", "NTA - she\u2019s proven herself unreliable and until she proves otherwise this is totally an appropriate way to manage this situation.", "Easiest NTA today.\n\nShe's treated differently because she has behaved poorly in the past.", "NTA. \n\nShe was incredibly rude for keeping the money and not bothering to show up, she ought to be covering this trip out of pocket (well, not even that - you already paid for it!).\n\nShe can either cover costs herself or accept your terms. She's still got a bit of growing up to do.", "NTA. She should be thankful you cover their trip. Not many parents would do so.", "I wonder if maybe she's having money trouble and is too embarrassed to ask for help.  Even though needing a little financial help in your early 20s is totally normal, a lot of kids feel really ashamed of doing so.  Planning a road trip to visit mom and then cancelling might feel better to her than admitting that she's not managing to be 100% self-sufficient.  \n\nWhatever the reasoning, though, right now she's reaping the consequences of repeatedly not doing what she said she was going to do.\n\nNTA, although maybe you can give your daughter a phone call and gently ask about the situation.", "NTA\n\nThis has nothing to do with her sister. It has to do entirely with her own behavior. Tell her she can refund (or use) the money from the cancellations and you can get back to the old system.", "You are absolutely NTA for not letting your kid use you as a bank machine, she has proven that she will do it repeatedly.\n\nYou'd be reasonable to just tell her that you're not giving her the money until she arrives (or at all) if she does it again.", "NTA clearly", "NTA. Frankly, I don't even think you should paying for all of this. She's an adult.", "NTA \n\nTo start with, this is generous of you. (I know, sometimes you need to pay to get kids to visit, that's fine.) But she's a grown woman and should be able to get herself from point A to point B on her own. I wouldn't transfer anything to her until she arrived.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t be paying for your daughter to visit you in the first place, but since you do; you\u2019d expect to see the money be spent appropriately. She has STOLEN from you previously.", "NTA and you are very generous! I used to drive about the same distance to see my mom but she never did anything like that. I'm not complaining at all, i could afford it.", "NTA.  Sounds like a great idea.", "NTA. Honestly they are adults it's time to stop giving them money. If they want to visit you let them spend their own money to visit their mother.", "This sounds pretty simple.  You can trust your younger daughter(s.)  You can't trust the oldest.  The rule you have established reflects this.  Your oldest is unhappy because she's been caught stealing/scamming money from your,  and that she can't do so anymore.

I think that's what helped keep my relationship with my mom's side of the family so strong. \n\nSecond, NTA. Your daughter has betrayed your trust enough times that you drew a reasonable boundary. Children aren't all the same, and they shouldn't be treated the same. Your youngest has proven to be trustworthy and reliable, your oldest isn't. You're \"meeting her where she's at\" as we say in the harm reduction world - you are preventing her from being able to cause harm to your relationship with her.", "NTA. And a clever solution.", "NTA. She's unreliable and steals from you. She should be grateful you're still in contact, let alone that you pay for the trips. I think some reasonable rules to prevent theft are more than warranted here", "NTA, she was fully running a scam on you. I\u2019m sorry your daughter is conning you", "NTA, and I'd say she deserves no money now. You're being generous. She's an adult who knowingly took advantage of your generosity.
