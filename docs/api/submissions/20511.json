If you're letting her decorate the rest of the house, she would obviously think you like her art and wouldn't mind doing your room too.", "YTA. Getting mad at someone for a rule you made up in your head and didn\u2019t tell them is childish. Ripping things off of the wall is childish. YOU are acting childish.", "YTA\n\nShe tried to do a nice thing and you reacted like an abusive AH. What is wrong with her painting the courtains anyway?", "YTA. You specified that it was for your band practice, not that she couldn\u2019t decorate it. She probably thought she was doing something kind to make the room look nice for you. Your behavior was totally out of line. You didn\u2019t have to yell at her and ruin her work. You could have simply told her that you thought you would be decorating the room and ask her to take the curtains down. You know. Like a rational mature adult.", "YTA- Dude, wtf. You need to learn how to control your anger. What you did was NOT acceptable behavior, and you need to apologize now.", "YTA - Physical destruction as an outlet for anger is inappropriate and very scary to others. This is a red flag to the both of you that you need counseling. Her crying rather than leaving is a flag that she needs to go too.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t tell her this, but assumed it was common sense.\u201d You agreed to her decorating, even think she talented, but just assumed a room was off limits without talking to her\u2026and you ripped them! Yes, YTA! You may need therapy to work through anger issues - she didn\u2019t deserve your response. YTA", "YTA. \n\nThe agreement did not include that she couldn't decorate the space or even use the space. It was just that the space would be used for band practice. And your anger is the real problem. There was nothing to be angry about and she needs to reconsider living with you. All you had to say was \"Hey, these would look great in the X room.\" That would have been the end of it. You had no reason to yell or rip down anything. It's ridiculous behavior.", "YTA and it sounds like it\u2019s time for some anger management classes.", "YTA - yes, of course you are. There is no way this is defensible.", "YTA - You should have specified, even reading this I was confused how the two were linked, since you only mentioned needing it for practice. Also like you could have just took them down like a normal person...", "YTA\nYour reaction was beyond unwarranted. You need to get your temper under control. I understand that you may have wanted a space for you to decorate and be \u201cyours\u201d but you needed to communicate this and not expect your gf to be a mind reader. You agreed on what the bedroom would be for NOT who would decorate it. This would make me seriously reconsider a relationship. Acting violently out of anger is never okay and is the reddest of flags. You need to apologize and be better.", "YTA.\n\nSince when does the curtain decoration impact your ability to rehearse? Also ripping the curtains out of anger? Dude, you should get that anger under control with some therapy or something. Your GF shouldn\u2019t have to put up with that.", "YTA. You can have a conversation without screaming and ripping stuff.", "YTA. You\u2019re allowed to feel whatever you want but your behavior is your responsibility. A simple \u201chey this was gonna be my space for my creativity can we save this space for me?\u201d Instead you yelled at her and ripped them up? Are you 5? Grow up you\u2019re very toxic and childish.", "YTA, assuming that someone knows your needs, wants or intentions without actually communicating them to that other person. Then getting angry and having a tantrum when they cannot and did not read your mind basically is truly not cool.", "Complete and utter AH you probably scared her and you need to apologize. Worrying behaviour", "YTA. Straight to anger management classes you go.", "YTA. Dude, apologize to your girlfriend and after that, go to freaking therapy! You massively overreacted. You didn't confirm with her nor tell her that she couldn't decorate it. You still had to voice that! It wasn't freaking common sense since it was unspoken. You don't fly off the handle like that, you have a decent conversation like an adult, not like an entitled child!", "YTA mainly because of your reaction. Instead of sitting down and talking it out and resolving the misunderstanding, you screamed at her and destroyed her work. This is abusive behavior, and you need to apologize. It's comparable to if she found one of your band's instruments in another part of the house and yelled at you and destroyed it because she assumed that band instruments would only be in the band practice room.", "YTA. Like other's have said that's genuinely concerning behaviour. She probably just wanted to do something nice for you and assumed painting your curtains would make you happy and you responded like a jerk", "YTA. Im worried for your girlfriends future with you around.", "You sound toxic as hell from that reaction.", "You are DEFINITELY the asshole. Not just the asshole, but the whole ass. You got so angry that you ripped the curtains? One, you destroyed her work. How would you feel if you hung up your music and she screamed at you then ripped it up?  When you destroyed her art, you destroyed a piece of her. And get some help with that anger. And none of that \"I'm just passionate about my music and my space for my music\". That's just a fancy way of saying \"I'm a dk, and you have to deal with it.\"", "YTA. Why didn't you explain that you want the space to be left alone? It's just curtains, dude. There's no reason to lose your mind. \n\nGet counseling for your anger. That was totally unnecessary.", "YTA. Regardless of your feelings about the curtains, ripping them in anger is quite extreme and makes me wonder what else you destroy when you feel justified by being angry.", "YTA. Understandable you want your own private space. That is healthy in a relationship. Getting blinded by anger enough to destroy what is likely a result of a misunderstanding requires finding a therapist immediately. You didn't tell her explicitly to not paint your room.\n\nSide note: I find it perplexing you are supportive of her creativity, but offended when it enters your band room? You could have asked her to paint something specific as it would show you have been proud of her creativity.", "YTA, really worrying behavior right there.", "YTA with an anger problem. You\u2019re an adult, you could have talked it out with throwing a tantrum and ripping curtains. Also the curtains could have been moved to another room", "It seemed like she was trying to do something nice for you by making your band room more aesthetically pleasing by decorating, and your response was to destroy all her work by ripping everything to shreds instead of talking it out and moving the curtains to a different room. YTA.", "YTA bro! Don't get tight about fucking curtains! Y'all just bought a HOUSE together! I hope you have many years of happiness in that house. Please learn to communicate better if you want to have a future.", "YTA, even if you believe she was in the wrong, you could have reacted in a way better way. Such an outburst like that is a major red flag honestly. More work needs to be done on your communication", "\u201ci thought it was understood\u201d it obviously wasn\u2019t.", "YTA, and check into anger management. Also, learn to use your words. If you didn\u2019t want the room decorated, you could have acted like a grown up and said so.", "I don\u2019t understand all these YTA comments. It is common knowledge you can\u2019t sing if there are painted curtains in a room. /s", "YTA you are a adult stop having tantruns over nothing, your never said to her that the room was of limits and probaly she tought that you eould like the decoration, now everything that she will do she will Wonder if you will become a amgry 3 year old, if she stays with you", "YTA, Kyle. Were the curtains impeding on your ability to make sick tunes with your buds? Do you also punch holes in the drywall when your partner does things you don\u2019t like but never talked about, just \u201cassumed were common sense\u201d? Get a grip, and a therapist. I hope this is a once-off and not part of a darker pattern.", "YTA. I don't even have to explain.", "YTA.", "YTA - There is honestly no way that you could not be in this scenario. Your GF just painted you custom artwork (taking a likely non-insignificant number of hours) for you to enjoy in your band practice room thinking it would make you happy & you destroyed it in anger. I would consider talking with someone regarding your anger response.", "YTA You assumed instead of communication and then majorly overreacted. Not only are you the major AH here, you destroyed her work and owe her huge apology.", "YTA. Your have a nasty immature temper.", "YTA. Learn to communicate and stop throwing temper tantrums at your big age.", "YTA. There are much, much better ways to approach this\u2026 especially with a situation that probably involves miscommunication. BTW, you *thought* she understood. You could have (while angry, sure) expressed your feelings which would probably get a genuine apology from her. You\u2019ll then be able to talk through the situation and the process of getting the curtains washed or buying a new one- all without having the curtains ripped apart and her getting yelled at because you didn\u2019t make it clear to her.", "YTA-You tell her what you want or don\u2019t want to have happen. You don\u2019t expect her to read your mind or for it to be common sense. You especially don\u2019t rip them down like a toddler having a tantrum.", "YTA. Your response was disproportionate to the drapes. You could have spoken to her calmly and not reacted with such anger. You made assumptions and she probably did too. You may want to reflect on why you got so angry. You claim you\u2019re fine with her decorating but it doesn\u2019t sound that way due to how you reacted.", "YTA - you lashed out violently because she isn\u2019t a kind reader. Get professional help.", "YTA, there was a misunderstanding about the band room, and instead of clarifying the point at issue (whether or not she was allowed to decorate in that room) you threw a tantrum and tore up what could have been hours of her hard work in a fit.  Seriously uncool, and an obviously asshole move.", "Draperies, and your feelings about them, are not yell worthy subject matter. She\u2019s making a beautiful home for both of you and you pissed on her parade.  I hope she walks away", "Holy F\u2014-! YTA. Wanting to set up your practice room yourself is not the problem. It\u2019s the fact that you threw a temper tantrum rather than address it like an adult. First, why are you getting so angry over this? Second, why are you yelling? You can\u2019t use your big people words to tell your girlfriend how you feel without yelling and violence? And finally, rather than take them down, you ripped her artwork. Unless you are the only one on that deed, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to worry about what\u2019s in the band room. It\u2019ll be the guest bedroom for the folks you sell the house to when you and GF divide assets.", "YTA\n\nNo explanation needed.", "YTA. That's a seriously concerning response to something so minor. Are you prone to angry outbursts like this?\n\nI would really recommend talking to a therapist.", "You know what happens when you assume right? Well you do now! \n\nYTA for not communicating better, for all you know she just wanted to make your practice room nicer for you and the other band members, but you didn't ask it seems, you assumed. People also assume that common sense is common, (voice over: 'It's not...') Sometimes it's got to be to learned.\n\nWork on your communication together, apologize first though then have a thorough conversation about boundaries and expections about each other.", "YTA. She isn\u2019t a mind reader. Curtains can be replaced very easily. You were verbally (and likely emotionally) abusive.", "Damn you are def the AH. Also you need anger therapy or something. She decorated a room and your response was violent blind rage. \n\nHopefully you fix yourself or that poor girl finds a way out. Shame you\u2019ve signed the commitment like a house together.", "YTA. You are a violent abuser. You need help.", "That escalated quickly YTA", "YTA. If I was your girlfriend I would leave. How often does your anger manifest itself in ways that are harmful to her? Or harmful to the success of your relationship in general? Cause I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve acted like this.", "YTA   you THOUGHT  it was understood.  Did you actually say so.?     Artistic does equal psychic mind reader.   You've got major major grovelling to do. If she wants to hear it.", "YTA, she probably thought you would like it :(", "YTA. Do her a favor and leave her\u2014she\u2019s gonna be much, much happier without your anger management problems in the future.\n\nEdit: this has to be bait, right? No one\u2019s this stupid or emotionally undeveloped\u2026 right?", "YTA. \n\nDude.", "YTA. And have anger problems!", "YTA.  Yelling and ripping the curtains is pre-school behavior.  Way over the top for this situation.  She may have crossed a line, but you went so far over the line, you can\u2019t see it in your rear-view mirror.\n\nEdit:  Agreeing that room would be for band practice is very different from agreeing she wouldn\u2019t do any decor work in there.", "YTA, this isn't how grown ups behave, and she's gonna get sick of your BS and leave one day.", "YTA, if you have to lead with \"I did a violent act because someone tried to brighten my life with art\" then you should know YTA, it's common sense.", "Yta and i hope she dumps your ass. Red flag right away. Whats gonna happen when she makes something you dont like for dinner, are you gonna throw the plate on the floor and yell at her like you did over a curtain? Grow tf up", "YTA. Very immature behaviour", "I've said this before and I'll say it again.\n\nSomeone who doesn't reply to any comments knows they're the AH before hitting post.", "YTA\n\nYeah I wouldn't talk to you either. That much of an anger reaction is not okay. For me personally it would be terrifying. Any kind of destruction in anger is already starting red flag territory. \n\nA lot of people have already said you need therapy, and I'm kinda gonna add my vote there. Not in a \"there's something wrong with you\" aggressive way, but honestly someone professional might be able to help you learn how to express yourself without extreme outbursts.\n\nAs for whether or not she should have decorated in there. Yeah you can assume all you want about something, but if communication didn't happen, you can't get pissed about it. And it certainly is not \"common sense\". Common sense is not crossing the road in front of oncoming traffic. If I had a theme going on throughout my house I'd probably decorate a room that was strictly for my partner's hobby as well. Though I may ask first, but that's cuz my relationship clearly has more communication than yours. Maybe that should be worked on.", "YTA. \n\nYou didn't communicate. \n\nYou destroyed property.\n\nYou scared her and made her cry. \n\nOn what planet is that an appropriate reaction?", "YTA. You claiming the room for your band is NOT the same thing as \u201cdo not decorate this room at all.\u201d Moreover, your reaction was extreme and unhinged - you were furious and screamed at her about something that could have been easily removed? You do know that curtains are not permanent right? Like you could have SPOKEN to her like a normal person and asked her if perhaps they could be used in another room\u2026", "YTA.\n\n1. Assumptions make an ass out of u and me.\n2. Way to go from 0 to 60, dude. WTF is actually wrong with you? You couldn't just take down the curtains and politely explain that you want to decorate the band room yourself?  \n\n\nETA: The reasonable interpretation here is that you are not a safe person to live with, and she should GTFO.", "Yta\n\nJesus what the hell\n\nShes not a mind reader.", "YTA. \n\nTwo things here. \n\nIt being your band room in no way translates to she\u2019s not allowed to decorate there. This is your fuck up for not communicating. \n\nYou ripping up the curtains in anger is abusive. There is literally nothing she could have done that would justify this behaviour. You need to have a long hard look in the mirror about your behaviour before you hurt someone.", "YTA Big time!", "YTA.  You are a terrible bf.", "YTA. You completely overreacted. You expected her to read your mind? And now you\u2019re mad that she did something presumably because she thought you would appreciate it.\nApologize to your girlfriend and do better.", "Obviously yta", "YTA. You realize destroying property and making someone cry is not a normal way for an adult to approach a communication issue.", "YTA. You made an ass of yourself just like the saying about assuming goes.", "YTA, you went over board.", "YTA. Reread what you wrote aloud.  The answer is obvious", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t just yell and rip things out of anger. You\u2019re old enough to know better. You need to learn to control your emotions better.\n\n\nYou said it was your band room- you didn\u2019t say it was off limits.", "YTA, first the way you handled the scenario makes you a huge AH, but also you never said you told her NOT to decorate/paint your room so you\u2019re doubly the AG", "How the hell would painted curtains impede your band practice in any way? She just wanted to do something nice for the room, and you go roaring in there and rip the curtains down? What is wrong with you? I am talking flowers, candy, a spa weekend just to start your apology to her.", "YTA and should probably look into anger management programs in your area", "You\u2019re the asshole. Why the fuck would you get so aggressive with her? over some curtains?", "YTA. We all know the reason why you freaked out. You didn\u2019t want your band mates to see the \u201cgirly\u201d curtains and think that you have no say in your own house. Tell me I\u2019m wrong!", "YTA. Yelling and ripping things in the house is violence. Imo that's a deal breaker. If you want to keep your gf apologise sincirely and work on your anger isues. Find a good therapist and let her see that you are really trying.", "YTA, and a massive one at that. You didn't tell her that you wanted that room left alone and then flew into a rage so bad you made her cry because she couldn't read your mind. I'd go further and argue it's a massive red flag that I hope she recognizes and leaves your sorry ass.", "YTA- you threw a tantrum when your gf crossed your imaginary boundary. As a woman I would be concerned about the out of proportion anger you display over something trivial that you failed to communicate.", "YTA. I'd leave you immediately for that behaviour.

Just because you thought \u201cthis is my band practice room\u201d meant \u201cshe can\u2019t decorate it\u201d, doesn\u2019t mean she knew that. You need to clearly communicate your expectations and not assume anyone can read your mind.", "YTA... Despite popular belief people aren't mind readers. If she didn't know to not paint them you're the asshole for throwing a hissy fit and tearing then up. I hope she smartens up and leaves you..", "YTA for overreacting to something so minor it could have been fixed with a simple conversation. \u201cSweetie I\u2019m going to take these down, I want a different vibe for my music room\u201d. Instead you get mad and destroy them? Maybe you need some more growing-up time before you live with a partner", "YTA. While it's important to establish boundaries for creative expression in shared spaces, ripping the curtains in anger was a massive overreaction. Especially since your boundaries weren\u2019t as clearly communicated as you thought. Apologize to your girlfriend and reestablish boundaries that respect both of your interests. But in general, just don\u2019t go nuclear so quickly. If you can\u2019t control it, you have anger issues you need to address.", "On what planet would you not be an asshole for this?! Even Klingons would know YTA!", "YTA. \n\nThere's absolutely nothing she could have done, no matter how wrong, no matter how well communicated, that should ever lead to you destroying things in anger.

Ripping the curtains off? Seriously? She was just doing something nice.", "YTA and I hope she never does anything nice for you ever again.

You've got an anger problem if you think destroying things when pissed is appropriate, because it seriously isn't. YTA just for that. \n\nCommunication is important. Using a room for a specific purpose doesn't automatically mean that you own that room and nothing can be done to it without your permission. You establish these things, together.
