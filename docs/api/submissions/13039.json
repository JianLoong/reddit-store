Recently, she has gotten into the original Star Trek show, as well as the Next Generation. Ruby is also a big reader and has started to collect a few of the old Star Trek books that she finds in used bookstores and thrift stores. These books usually cost anywhere from 50 cents to a couple of dollars. \n\nMy nanny, Tessa (f22), hangs out with Ruby most days after she gets out of school. Tessa has been our nanny for over a year now and she and Ruby get along great. Tessa is big into to thrifting and will often keep an eye out for the books Ruby wants. This is not typically a problem and Ruby always pays Tessa back for the books using her allowance.\n\nThe problem occurred when Tessa went on a family vacation out west. Apparently she went thrifting during this trip and found some books for Ruby. She texted Ruby asking her if she wanted the books and Ruby said yes. \n\nWell Tessa returned yesterday with a stack of about 35 books and told Ruby they cost $50. Ruby doesn't have this much money and told Tessa. Tessa then asked me if I would cover the cost. I said no as Tessa had never asked me about buying Ruby the books, nor was I aware of the conversation between the two of them. Tessa got upset and I asked Ruby to show me the text which made no mention of price, or even the amount of books she was buying. Tessa only said that she found \"some\" books for Ruby. Ruby is on the autism spectrum and does not read between the lines. You have to be very literal with her. \n\nPreviously, Tessa has never bought Ruby more than one or two books at a time, so I told her that she should have clarified with Ruby regarding the amount, or double checked with me before purchasing, and that I would not be paying the $50. Tessa said she could not return the books because they came from the thrift store. I stood firm in my decision and reiterated that she should have asked me first. \n\nTessa left and Ruby is very upset. I know Tessa is a student and does not have a ton of money so am I the asshole for not paying Tessa for the books?\n\nEDIT: Because some people are asking- I am a single parent to Ruby and while $50 dollars will not make or break the bank, it is definitely an unexpected expense. I provide Tessa with an extra amount of money each month to spend on whatever she wants to do with Ruby (movies, the mall, etc).

If she wants something extra expensive which is beyond the scope of her normal allowance or she's run out of this month's allowance, you'll pay for it (assuming you have the funds for it), but that amount comes out of her next month's allowance to make up for the extra you had to pay this month. This will allow you to salvage the relationship with Tessa as well as making your daughter happy, while keeping your pocketbook safe. \n\nI'd also lay out to Tessa that she needs to be clear in the future about what all she's buying and especially how much it costs, BEFORE buying it; it's not right to leave things so vague and expect people to just be on board automatically, even if Ruby wasn't autistic (I say this as an autistic 22YO).

Definitely sit down with Ruby and talk to her about this and her role in agreeing to the purchase without details. That being said, you will have to balance it by explaining that what Tessa did was coming from a good place but is not the way to handle this & in that someone with worse intent could try take advantage of her by trying to guilt her to pay for things she didn\u2019t agree to.

Since you give Tessa already a kind of monthly stipend to spend on whatever, why not take $50 out of next month's stipend and pay that to Tessa and then explain to Ruby this is why her \"fun budget\" for the upcoming month might be smaller?

That's an inappropriate amount to ask from someone who's not even a teenager, especially without involving a parent (who's also the boss).\n\nIf you want to maintain the relationship with Tessa, maybe pay her back $25 like you both went in on a gift.

So based off that information I\u2019m making the assumption that this isn\u2019t a full-time nanny which of course would be a luxury.", "They can definitely be a necessity if you have a child with disabilities. Ruby is on the Spectrum. The nanny probably is needed.\n\nWhen we were kids we had a nanny and she was a necessity. My dad worked insane hours and my mom\u2019s job didn\u2019t let out until after we kids were home. And my youngest sister was a baby. As long as my mom\u2019s job made more than the nanny cost, a nanny was needed no matter how tight things were.", "Yeah that would need to be clarified. On first pass thought of it as a babysitter that was there often but not necessarily a full time nanny, so that would change things.", "No but it\u2019s inappropriate to ask a child for money you know they don\u2019t have", "Yep. I see it now. I still don\u2019t think this is a bad thing, since it\u2019s following a pattern that has been accepted in the past. But I get your point.", "Yeah, not sure it went down like that, but ok.", "I think we agree in general.  It *is* possible that an unexpected $50 expense would be an issue, I just don't see this as a likely scenario.", "Yeah, that\u2019s the correct answer if you are an AH who doesn\u2019t care about your child.", "Gross.", "How the fuck would she know how much allowance the kid has saved up?", "Yeah actually, if you pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition and then are stingy with your paid help over 50 bucks, I\u2019m also going to think you\u2019re an asshole.\n\nShe never said it was a gift. She regularly buys books for the child and the child pays her back. It\u2019s still thoughtful and beyond the call of duty. Yes, she should have confirmed the amount but it was an honest, minor mistake.", "\"They put their kid in private school, they must be fine.\" It's an assumption and completely baseless. Plenty of people stretch their budgets to the breaking point to provide for their kids.\"\n\nIf you can stretch your budget to afford a luxury then yes you are doing fine. Even if you have to reaaaaally stretch your budget. People that are not doing fine wouldn't even consider private school unless they were on some kind of scholarship. \n\nEven a $2k to $4k a year private school, your are doing fine. No one needs to pay for private school, if you are choosing to do it well that is up to you.", "I agree with you, honestly. I just wanted to point that out before others did because it's already causing so much debate.", "I prob just know a lot of broke people aha", "Exactly- she\u2019s a child what 14 y/o has $50 laying around. Seems nice enough but could be taking advantage of a child with autism is the other option.", "Yeah, I know I'm making an assumption but with these posts it's hard not to have to infer to some degree, especially when the OP doesn't respond in the comments to add more context.  You could be correct, but without any more info (the OP never responded to your request so we have no idea what their financial situation is) I'm just making a guess based on what info I have.\n\nEdit: I just saw that OP added an edit that said that $50 would not make or break them.  So I stand behind my original assessment.  The $50 to me would be worth it.  Dying on this hill for me would not.", "How would she be \u2018taking advantage\u2019 exactly? She brought her 35 books. That\u2019s a cost of about $1.50 a book. What would be in it for the nanny exactly, you think she skimmed a quarter off the top? Use some common sense.", "Why you so upset? Nobody said the mom had he enrolled in private schools- it was an example. \nNobody said it was an outright scam or lie but the way she went about it was deceptive at the least. Buying someone a few books doesn\u2019t mean 35, use some common sense."]}
