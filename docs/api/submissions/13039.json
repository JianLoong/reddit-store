Recently, she has gotten into the original Star Trek show, as well as the Next Generation. Ruby is also a big reader and has started to collect a few of the old Star Trek books that she finds in used bookstores and thrift stores. These books usually cost anywhere from 50 cents to a couple of dollars. \n\nMy nanny, Tessa (f22), hangs out with Ruby most days after she gets out of school. Tessa has been our nanny for over a year now and she and Ruby get along great. Tessa is big into to thrifting and will often keep an eye out for the books Ruby wants. This is not typically a problem and Ruby always pays Tessa back for the books using her allowance.\n\nThe problem occurred when Tessa went on a family vacation out west. Apparently she went thrifting during this trip and found some books for Ruby. She texted Ruby asking her if she wanted the books and Ruby said yes. \n\nWell Tessa returned yesterday with a stack of about 35 books and told Ruby they cost $50. Ruby doesn't have this much money and told Tessa. Tessa then asked me if I would cover the cost. I said no as Tessa had never asked me about buying Ruby the books, nor was I aware of the conversation between the two of them. Tessa got upset and I asked Ruby to show me the text which made no mention of price, or even the amount of books she was buying. Tessa only said that she found \"some\" books for Ruby. Ruby is on the autism spectrum and does not read between the lines. You have to be very literal with her. \n\nPreviously, Tessa has never bought Ruby more than one or two books at a time, so I told her that she should have clarified with Ruby regarding the amount, or double checked with me before purchasing, and that I would not be paying the $50. Tessa said she could not return the books because they came from the thrift store. I stood firm in my decision and reiterated that she should have asked me first. \n\nTessa left and Ruby is very upset. I know Tessa is a student and does not have a ton of money so am I the asshole for not paying Tessa for the books?\n\nEDIT: Because some people are asking- I am a single parent to Ruby and while $50 dollars will not make or break the bank, it is definitely an unexpected expense. I provide Tessa with an extra amount of money each month to spend on whatever she wants to do with Ruby (movies, the mall, etc). If she wanted to spend this fund on books for Ruby, that would have been totally fine- but she had already used it up.", "created_utc": 1679618877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1203nq3/aita_for_not_reimbursing_my_nanny_for_books_she/", "score": 1244, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wants something extra expensive which is beyond the scope of her normal allowance or she's run out of this month's allowance, you'll pay for it (assuming you have the funds for it), but that amount comes out of her next month's allowance to make up for the extra you had to pay this month. This will allow you to salvage the relationship with Tessa as well as making your daughter happy, while keeping your pocketbook safe. \n\nI'd also lay out to Tessa that she needs to be clear in the future about what all she's buying and especially how much it costs, BEFORE buying it; it's not right to leave things so vague and expect people to just be on board automatically, even if Ruby wasn't autistic (I say this as an autistic 22YO).

Definitely sit down with Ruby and talk to her about this and her role in agreeing to the purchase without details.

Since you give Tessa already a kind of monthly stipend to spend on whatever, why not take $50 out of next month's stipend and pay that to Tessa and then explain to Ruby this is why her \"fun budget\" for the upcoming month might be smaller?

I honestly think that what she did was insane. And she expected your autistic daughter to be able to just give her THAT MUCH MONEY without so much as talking to you? That's an inappropriate amount to ask from someone who's not even a teenager, especially without involving a parent (who's also the boss).\n\nIf you want to maintain the relationship with Tessa, maybe pay her back $25 like you both went in on a gift. She should also run it by you when your daughter gives her money.

She likely was very excited and is now hurt because of the reaction. *She still should not have expected you to cover an expense that was unexpected and not a necessity.*\n\n-*Ruby should have asked Tessa what the cost was if she's used to reimbursing her.* That's just something that is a natural part of learning about handling money and budgeting. This is a good opportunity to teach Ruby about being clear about unknown expenses/budget communication in an age and developmentally appropriate way. Since she is a special needs child, it will also help in the future with social awkwardness around discussions of money and being stuck in a place you didn't expect to be because it was too uncomfortable to talk about funds.

But it's even harder to find a nanny that you can trust with your child and who is willing / able to deal with a special needs child at all. You could even ask Tessa and Ruby to work out a payment plan or a situation in which Ruby gets X amount of books over time until she is able to reimburse Tessa out of her own pocket money. There is no reason for this to cause a perpetual rift. \n\nThis is clearly an issue of communication and not ill intent on anyone's part.\n\n**OP, who is Ruby's favorite Trek character?** \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd96\ud83c\udffb", "YTA.. single parent with a nanny and $50 dollars is an expense.", "How can you afford the nanny but not the extra one time $50?", "Pay the 50 clarify that she needs to be clear about pricing in the future and deduct it from their future fun funds if you have to", "YTA.

Do you really think quality childcare with an actual bond is super cheap to come by?", "How many other items is the nanny doing unpaid\u2026..   well you just pissed away all that.  The book hunting actually costs far far far more then $50.  This was an employee giving you free labor to do a special service for the daughter.", "\u201cbaits\u201d", "do you have a kid because it seems all the parents commenting all say good childcare is extremely hard to find and especially as her child is autistic. her daughter has a well developed relationship with her nanny that firing her over something like this (it being the first time ever she has done this too) is irrational and ultimately going to make her life harder as well as really upsetting her autistic child which autistic children tend to be not trusting of new people or people in general so finding a nanny she likes and also routine and consistency in life is very important for an autistic child so disrupting her whole routine by taking away such a huge part of it will be sooooo hard on her kid and its not like she will understand why she isnt coming to see her anymore bcz to her daughter im sure she sees her nanny as her friend and losing a friend is hard on any child and if 50$ can prevent her child from going through a really stressful and upsetting time (possibly even traumatizing if she thinks her friend abandoned her) i think most parent would do it and this is me just mentioning one reason for her not firing her when its also in the moms best interest as well but her first priority is her daughters well being and the nanny is clearly a positive in their life", "Bait??? What bait???? She bought book for a 12 year old whose hobby is to read books that are hard to find.......Okay, i want to know at what point do you think that this was absurd and eason why it would be okay to fire a good nanny that cares of an autistic child who has a single parent to take care off", "I'm now in a position where I do have a nanny. If you can afford the luxury of a nanny, you can afford $50. Good childcare is worth the unexpected $50. OP should communicate with nanny , set boundaries for the future, and eat the $50.", "If the nanny had bought 1 or 2 books, like OP states she usually does, rather than 35, then it would be a sweet gesture. Buying someone 1 or 2 books and asking for a few dollars in return is one thing, but buying over 30 without confirming how many were wanted, and then asking to cover the price when she didn\u2019t initially state she was going to buy 30+ books isn\u2019t really fair? Especially if she ran it by the autistic child, rather than her mother. I\u2019m autistic and 27, I base a lot of my understanding of people on patterns of behaviour, if someone always bought me 1 or 2 books I\u2019ll always assumed they\u2019ll follow the behaviour/routine. If she didn\u2019t state how many she was buying, OP\u2019s daughter probably assumed it would just be the one and she could afford it herself. \n\nAlso it\u2019s a respect thing! My best friend has my 2 year old godson, he\u2019s adorable I love buying him stuff but out of respect I don\u2019t buy massive giant presents that take up loads of room. I always check what I\u2019m getting him with my friend first to make sure she actually wants a large, flashy toy in her house or even has room for it. If someone showed up to my house tomorrow with 35 books I didn\u2019t want and didn\u2019t plan on getting, I\u2019d be pissed trying to fit 35 random books onto my shelves. \n\nEdit : spelling", "A single book would have been thoughtful enough- $50 is well past the \u201cI should check in with Mom about this\u201d price point unless it was previously agreed upon as higher than that", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or wrong and we don\u2019t know if Tessa and Ruby had any verbal conversations about it prior to it happening either. We don\u2019t know if there was ever a conversation like \u201cplease buy every one you find so I can build my collection\u201d and when she did find a bunch, she bought them all. \n\nI guess the only option that makes sense then is to tell Tessa she\u2019s not allowed to buy things for Ruby anymore. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t want them, but does Ruby? I feel like it makes sense that if she wants them then she can earn the money to pay for them. I\u2019m mostly concerned with what the actual question is, which is AITA for not paying for the books. I imagine not paying for the books is going to damage the relationship with the nanny, regardless of who is right or wrong. So I guess it\u2019s up to OP as to whether they\u2019re willing to risk losing their nanny over $50.", ">Mind you, I can understand how this would be strange and unwanted for a non-bibliophile\n\nI keep reminding myself that. I'm notorious in my friend group for blowing through 300-400 page novels in a couple of days (or less). I was a tween/teen when Harry Potter books came out and I had those midnight releases read within 24 hours *every time*. \n\nSomeone who isn't into books is going to look at that stack and go \"what the fuck, my kid will be reading all year\" whereas I look at it and know I'll have them done in 2 months tops (especially if they're the Star Trek books I'm thinking of). A 12 year old will probably be a bit slower than my autistic adult ass, but if it's her special interest I wouldn't bet longer than 3-4 months.", "As an autistic adult, I second your THIS. I mean, finding *friends* who understand special interests and keep their eye for things is rare. \n\nI went undiagnosed as a child and my parents were lucky my main babysitter/nanny was my aunt who was an elementary school teacher who was initially interested in being a school psychologist. I think she's part of why I wasn't diagnosed with either ADHD (I got that at 18) or autism (discovered in my 30s) as a kid. She gave me the tools I needed and I did okay until I was on my own. \n\nIf the internet was so shady and I could believe OP was serious, I'd be willing to fork over some cash toward the $50 because it is *not* worth losing Tessa over.", "I wanna see you pay $50 on something you don't necessarily need and didn't expect. $50 might not be that much for some, but for others it's a whole week of food they can't get because of that. Also Op pays her her normal pay and extra pocket money she can spend on the kid. She already gets extra money. And Tessa could also just gift the $50 to the kid, because it's been apparently years she knows her by now. A little act of kindness to show her that she cares about her not just as a babysitter that gets payed. If she only askes the kid \"do you want those books?\" without any mentioning of the price or clarifying it I would assume it's as a present in the first place", "years? it\u2019s been just over one.", "This. What\u2019s wrong with you people?\n\nOh, wait, it\u2019s Reddit.", ">Tessa (f22), hangs out with Ruby most days after she gets out of school\n\nMost people would call that a babysitter, OP calls it a nanny - know one should call it a \u201cluxury\u201d that\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s childcare.", "good for you genuinely<3. \n\nthe nanny asked the KID if she wanted the books, didn't mention the price or needing to pay back AND didn't tell op before hand! how delusional do you have to be to think op should pay? even if op can afford the 50 this is on the nanny for being a moron.", "Sure it\u2019s disrespectful and irresponsible of the nanny. But it sounds like otherwise they really like her and it\u2019s a great fit and this was an atypical purchase/situation and maybe the nanny just made a one time mistake with it because it was a super deal and Star Trek and got excited and lost in the details while this was all going down with the texts and all. Sooo, the question comes down to \u2014> Is it the hill to die on if the mom/?? Because if it\u2019s not, then pay the 50 - tell her not to do so again and move on. If that\u2019s the hill then yea, this nanny might quit any day if the mom stands her grounds on THIS, so then they\u2019ll have to find a new nanny and spend a lot more than $50 and a lot more fine/energy looking for one.", "I never read faster than when I was a child/teenager. Our library had a seven book limit and my mum took me weekly. 35 books would have been six weeks of reading, max. \n\nI wonder where that skill went. These days it\u2019s more like a couple books a month, and that\u2019s in a good month.", "As an employer and a Director of HR for 45 years, I\u2019d like if you would kindly reread your post, except within the context of today\u2019s post-Covid job market. \n\nAre you at all familiar with the term \u201cquiet quitting?\u201d That\u2019s pretty much what would happen to my \u201cTessa\u201d if I attempted to counsel her in this situation. At least up until she texts saying that she\u2019s not coming back. No notice. And it\u2019s not just the twenty-something\u2019s, just yesterday I processed the termination paperwork for a 43 year old Director who went MIA for a week and then texted asking when he could drop off his keys and pickup his paycheck. And oh, the best part, he claims that we fired him because we suspended his cellphone and email access after not responding to texts or calls to his personal cellphone AND telling us that his company phone was in his office. It wasn\u2019t. Security protocols dictate that we secure the network. \n\nOh, no, that\u2019s not the best part. The best part is the security cameras. On his last day at work, when he supposedly had to leave early for a family emergency, he punched out, moved his SUV outside the staff entrance, and sat in his office, regularly checking the hallway to make sure the coast was clear, then he\u2019d run an armful of his personal possessions out to the SUV. Multiple trips over almost two hours. I\u2019m absolutely convinced that he told his wife that he was fired and that he\u2019s counting on unemployment. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to hold it in when we\u2019re in front of the Administrative Law Judge at his UI appeal. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019m sorry, I digress. The point is, in this labor market, especially with that generation, employees bolt at the merest of slights. Tessa **will** bolt. Most likely without notice. Every \u201creal\u201d employer today knows this. We have to learn to pick and choose our battles. \n\nFrom an HR perspective, OP has already explained her expectations to her employee, nothing more needs to be said. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t choose to fight this one, I have much more to lose. \ud83d\ude15", "I totally get that, but I still think if a household has $40k+ of disposable income to set aside for a nanny (which many households are unable to do regardless of need), then $50 for 35 books for the child is reasonable. It's a little annoying, but OP should choose their battles and communicate a limit for the future. A nanny that goes beyond their paid time to help enrich your child's hobbies is not something I'd want to lose over $50", "Also, a year with a child that age is 10 percent of their life. Again, what's your point?", "Yes, over one singular  year means \"years\" plural.", "Yea the nanny shouldn\u2019t have done any of that - I\u2019m pretty sure almost EVERYONE agrees on that, certainly the people on this specific thread,  it\u2019s not about who is right or wrong anymore, it\u2019s whether or not the mom should die on this hill, over $50 cuz the nanny did something dumb and technically inappropriate. \n\nThe nanny was wrong period. She shouldn\u2019t have texted this girl about the books and buying them without asking the parent for permission, that\u2019s a glaring mistake on her end. BUT, it happened, there\u2019s no going back, the books have been purchased and she\u2019s asked the girl for the money** and then the mom for reimbursement, when she realized the kid has spent her allowance for the month already. If the mom wants to \u201cteach her a lesson\u201d and get all strict about it now, then fine, it\u2019s her right. But is it worth it to destroy the relationship and lose this nanny? I would say no. Just make it a verbal lesson by telling her not to do it again but give her the money this one and only time. \n\n\n\n**which is honestly the weirdest thing about this whole situation I\u2019m surprised not everyone is calling attention to this particular part...a grown woman who is working as a nanny, with a girl on the spectrum, is asking for money from the girl she\u2019s supposed to be watching. I feel like she should know way better than that, and go straight to the mom for anything money related if anything. she\u2019s supposed to be THE RESPONSIBLE ADULT guiding this kid and finances and payments/reimbursements is something she handles with the mom, not the child.", "Well, hopefully OP can find another trustworthy moron that genuinely cares for her daughter.", "It\u2019s not following a pattern that\u2019s been accepted in the past though, buying books is a pattern yes, but if the nanny *always* just got me two and vaguely asked me if I wanted some books she thought I\u2019d like without telling me how many she was buying, I\u2019d assume it was 2 as it always has been! The issue isn\u2019t buying the books, the issue is the amount and how the nanny wasn\u2019t up front about it in the first place.", "Also OP says that Ruby is neurodivergent. Have fun finding a new nanny who:\n\n- is willing to take Ruby on\n- someone Ruby likes\n- as cheap as the current nanny", "My parents paychecks were spent like this:\n\nMom: 90% nanny 10% emergencies (Drs, medical bills, etc.)\n\nDad: mortgage, food, gas, electric, car\n\nThere were months they needed to decide between having food and paying bills. There wasn\u2019t an extra 100$ for me to get the American Girl doll I asked for from the time I was five until I was 12. My mom admitted to me a few years ago that she felt so guilty because she knew how much I wanted one and she couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nThey would have paid the 50$, if only to keep a good sitter. But it would definitely have caused them financial distress. It may be reasonable, but having a nanny doesn\u2019t always mean someone is financially secure. It could just mean that the 10% is worth the 90%.", "idk if someone trustworthy would pull this crap tbh. it would be a whole different story if she would have just asked. ik id pay her the 50 if i was asked before hand but you dont ask a 12yro without mentioning money, thats something you ask the parent", "Not to mention what another poster has said, is OP paying Tessa for shopping excursions on her daughter\u2019s behalf? At her hourly wage, after how many trips, how much do you suppose that might be?\n\nSo, over at r/askHR, we require posters to identify their state so that we can help identify their state laws. Regardless, what would you think that your state\u2019s wage and hour division would think about this. Tessa has texts authorizing these shopping trips.

I would also say it's a testament to the systemic lack of affordable childcare (assuming you're in USA) ... still, a salaried nanny providing one-on-one personalized care is a luxury service. OP said herself this wouldn't break the bank. The nanny has apparently had the same arrangement for buying books for OP's kid in the past-- it's just this time she exceeded a price limit that wasn't previously communicated to her. Punishing your employee, who is a student likely living paycheck-to-paycheck, over this misunderstanding is an AH move", "This doesn't sound like an untrustworthy moment so much as an overzealous but thoughtful situation. The daughter absolutely loves these books. They aren't always an easy thing to find. On vacation, in a completely different area, she stumbled across a literal treasure trove.

While it would have been a good idea to text OP, I can completely understand getting carried away in the moment on such an amazing find.", "It wasn\u2019t unusual when I was growing up. We weren\u2019t the only ones who did this. These days most people use babysitting groups instead.\n\nAn arrangement with a 12 year old. Tessa should have thought before asking a 12 year old for 50$. I do think the mother should pay - my parents would have - but I think they\u2019re both in the wrong. I\u2019d say ESH."]}
