{"id": 13039, "submission_id": "1203nq3", "title": "AITA for not reimbursing my nanny for books she bought for my daughter?", "selftext": "\nMy daughter, Ruby, is 12. Recently, she has gotten into the original Star Trek show, as well as the Next Generation. Ruby is also a big reader and has started to collect a few of the old Star Trek books that she finds in used bookstores and thrift stores. These books usually cost anywhere from 50 cents to a couple of dollars. \n\nMy nanny, Tessa (f22), hangs out with Ruby most days after she gets out of school. Tessa has been our nanny for over a year now and she and Ruby get along great. Tessa is big into to thrifting and will often keep an eye out for the books Ruby wants. This is not typically a problem and Ruby always pays Tessa back for the books using her allowance.\n\nThe problem occurred when Tessa went on a family vacation out west. Apparently she went thrifting during this trip and found some books for Ruby. She texted Ruby asking her if she wanted the books and Ruby said yes. \n\nWell Tessa returned yesterday with a stack of about 35 books and told Ruby they cost $50. Ruby doesn't have this much money and told Tessa. Tessa then asked me if I would cover the cost. I said no as Tessa had never asked me about buying Ruby the books, nor was I aware of the conversation between the two of them. Tessa got upset and I asked Ruby to show me the text which made no mention of price, or even the amount of books she was buying. Tessa only said that she found \"some\" books for Ruby. Ruby is on the autism spectrum and does not read between the lines. You have to be very literal with her. \n\nPreviously, Tessa has never bought Ruby more than one or two books at a time, so I told her that she should have clarified with Ruby regarding the amount, or double checked with me before purchasing, and that I would not be paying the $50. Tessa said she could not return the books because they came from the thrift store. I stood firm in my decision and reiterated that she should have asked me first. \n\nTessa left and Ruby is very upset. I know Tessa is a student and does not have a ton of money so am I the asshole for not paying Tessa for the books?\n\nEDIT: Because some people are asking- I am a single parent to Ruby and while $50 dollars will not make or break the bank, it is definitely an unexpected expense. I provide Tessa with an extra amount of money each month to spend on whatever she wants to do with Ruby (movies, the mall, etc). If she wanted to spend this fund on books for Ruby, that would have been totally fine- but she had already used it up.\n\nEDIT 2: I definitely didn't expect this post to blow up overnight, so I'm going to add a bit more context. For those of you who are asking how I can afford a nanny for Ruby and still have $50 be a large unexpected expense- I do not pay for Tessa's services. Because Ruby is on the spectrum, she is entitled to benefits from our state, including care. The agency I work with pays Tessa. I am not involved in that process at all.\n\nUPDATE: I appreciate everyone's valuable insights into the situation. I have seen a few comments hinting to me about the fact that I don't support my daughter's reading habit. Please know this is DEFINITELY not the case. We are both big readers and frequent patrons of our local library. I am always supportive of Ruby getting new books. \n\nI talked to Tessa and told her that I appreciate her for thinking of Ruby, apologized for the misunderstanding, and have paid her for the books. We had a chat about expectations in the future and I don't think this will happen again. I have also talked to Ruby and we agreed that I would hold onto the books and she would pay me for them as she wishes. It's important to me that Ruby learns how to handle her finances appropriately, and we have decided that she will get two new books every week (she reads very quickly). \nAfter reading through your perspectives on the matter, I agree that it is better in the long run to lose the money and salvage the relationship between the three of us, and had not considered all the implications of doing otherwise.

If she wants something extra expensive which is beyond the scope of her normal allowance or she's run out of this month's allowance, you'll pay for it (assuming you have the funds for it), but that amount comes out of her next month's allowance to make up for the extra you had to pay this month. This will allow you to salvage the relationship with Tessa as well as making your daughter happy, while keeping your pocketbook safe. \n\nI'd also lay out to Tessa that she needs to be clear in the future about what all she's buying and especially how much it costs, BEFORE buying it; it's not right to leave things so vague and expect people to just be on board automatically, even if Ruby wasn't autistic (I say this as an autistic 22YO).

Definitely sit down with Ruby and talk to her about this and her role in agreeing to the purchase without details.

I wouldn't fire her or ruin this relationship tho because finding a good nanny that works with special needs children is like winning the lotto. I would definitely take a step back and calmly talk about all this and set standards for everything going forward.\n\nAs for the already purchased books, Why not set up a payment system? Ruby can still get her books but only when she can afford to pay.

Tessa is foolish for thinking she can hold Ruby, a child, accountable for a financial decision like this. Tessa is ultimately the adult here and that means the onus is more on her to confirm reimbursement with you, not her child ward, especially when it concerns a purchase that might put her outta pocket (being a student and all).\n\nBut, I do think the people saying not to give up on this business relationship have a point. Since you give Tessa already a kind of monthly stipend to spend on whatever, why not take $50 out of next month's stipend and pay that to Tessa and then explain to Ruby this is why her \"fun budget\" for the upcoming month might be smaller? I would also of course reiterate to Tessa that purchases over a certain amount must be negotiated with *you* not Ruby, so learning experiences to be had here all around.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH.

If she knew beforehand she wanted to buy that amount of books she should have immediately called to confirm. Now if you guys come back and she approaches the situation and acknowledges that with a large purchase she should always confirm with the parents which is you. Speak over your terms and arrangements that for something like this keep it at a set amount like max $10-$15.

I have never, in three years with this family, spent $50 as a surprise. \n\nIf $50 financially hurt Tessa, then she should have realized that that is a LOT of money, especially if you already had plans for that money. I honestly think that what she did was insane. And she expected your autistic daughter to be able to just give her THAT MUCH MONEY without so much as talking to you? That's an inappropriate amount to ask from someone who's not even a teenager, especially without involving a parent (who's also the boss).\n\nIf you want to maintain the relationship with Tessa, maybe pay her back $25 like you both went in on a gift. She should also run it by you when your daughter gives her money. I think that's a little weird if it's happening often. \n\nThis is also a life lesson for Ruby that she doesn't have to pay for what she doesn't agree to buy/directly ask for.

She is important to your daughter and you can model for her how to solve a conflict and not hold a grudge", "NAH\n\n-Tessa didn't check with you, which she absolutely should have for something that much more expensive than what the arrangement between her and Ruby covers usually, but she clearly cares about your daughter and she was enthusiastic about her special interest. 35 Trek novels for $50 is a freaking *steal* (I am assuming that there were no repeats in the lot so these are all new books to your daughter) and Tessa must have been thrilled to find such a great deal and that went through the time and the effort to get them back to your daughter instead of just grabbing a few of them and calling it done. She likely was very excited and is now hurt because of the reaction. *She still should not have expected you to cover an expense that was unexpected and not a necessity.*\n\n-*Ruby should have asked Tessa what the cost was if she's used to reimbursing her.* That's just something that is a natural part of learning about handling money and budgeting. This is a good opportunity to teach Ruby about being clear about unknown expenses/budget communication in an age and developmentally appropriate way. Since she is a special needs child, it will also help in the future with social awkwardness around discussions of money and being stuck in a place you didn't expect to be because it was too uncomfortable to talk about funds. Money is a touchy subject, and it can definitely be something that I have found other ND people have difficulty discussing.\n\n-Being a single parent is hard, and I understand that this is an expense you did not account for and one that you do not feel comfortable with coming out of the blue. *You have every right to be upset about something that you were not consulted about being sprung on you like that.*\n\n\nI think as a one-off incident and then a discussion being had with Tessa about what is and what is not acceptable (for instance: communicating with you if there are purchases coming through that are above a certain amount just to keep this from happening in the future) this is still a salvageable situation. But it's even harder to find a nanny that you can trust with your child and who is willing / able to deal with a special needs child at all. You could even ask Tessa and Ruby to work out a payment plan or a situation in which Ruby gets X amount of books over time until she is able to reimburse Tessa out of her own pocket money.

But your use of the term furious is kind of worrisome. \n\nAlso your recommendation is that OP fire the nanny of her neruodivergent kid that takes special interest in the kids hobbies over what sounds like a miscommunication and overzealous but thoughtful moment.

Buying someone 1 or 2 books and asking for a few dollars in return is one thing, but buying over 30 without confirming how many were wanted, and then asking to cover the price when she didn\u2019t initially state she was going to buy 30+ books isn\u2019t really fair? Especially if she ran it by the autistic child, rather than her mother. I\u2019m autistic and 27, I base a lot of my understanding of people on patterns of behaviour, if someone always bought me 1 or 2 books I\u2019ll always assumed they\u2019ll follow the behaviour/routine.

I always check what I\u2019m getting him with my friend first to make sure she actually wants a large, flashy toy in her house or even has room for it.

I feel like it makes sense that if she wants them then she can earn the money to pay for them. I\u2019m mostly concerned with what the actual question is, which is AITA for not paying for the books.

Also, she expects a 12 y/o child to pay her back 50 dollars, when she KNOWS the child covers it from her allowance. A 12 y/o usually doesn't have that much money. This adds on the fact that the child wasn't informed about the fact that it was going to be 50 dollars beforehand.

My partner used to have a similar job through a company that provided caretakers, like nannies, to kids or young adults on the spectrum.

If he had made such a purchase, it would have been as a gift (and let's be honest, it was sweet of Tessa to think of Ruby when she saw the books, but they were in no way a gift to her), or if my partner needed reimbursement for something he bought, he would have to have communicated clearly with the family first.\n\nA lot of people don't seem to realize the nanny job is not paid by YOU. When my partner did this work, the family paid him nothing. They worked directly with the company and were not obligated to pay anything more. This type of arrangement is a social service, and it's a great resource to families like yours, but it is also an underpaid job, which I think is important to acknowledge. I've never known anyone in the field to be able to make ends meet with that job alone.\n\nSo your nanny got themselves into a pickle because they made an expense that they couldn't account for. Usually these types of social services will provide reimbursement for gas mileage driving the kid around and sometimes discounts on stuff like museum visits. But random thrifting probably won't be reimbursed \n\nI think you have two options:\n\nIf you can afford to pay the $50, I would recommend doing it to keep that working relationship positive, but also communicate that you can't do this again going forward. Make it clear that Ruby's allowance is small and she can't make big purchases like this expecting Ruby to reimburse her. I know a lot of other commenters are saying that the nanny was so sweet to think of your daughter, which is true, but what isn't sweet is that what she bought for your daughter weren't genuine gifts, in fact she wanted to get some money back for it all, so it could even be seen as taking advantage of Ruby just a little bit by not being upfront with her about the books. I know Tessa probably didn't intend it that way, but impact sometimes matters more than intent. It probably made Ruby feel guilty that she couldn't do anything to help resolve this and she probably felt bad that SHE couldn't pay, but she's only 12 and it's not fair to her.\n\nNow, if you truly cannot afford to pay the extra $50, then let Tessa know that the monthly allowance you usually give her to take Ruby to do fun things will have to be used up in advance to cover the cost of the books. So next month, instead of giving her extra pay to go do fun stuff out of the house, think of things they could do together for free.

For a purchase this big she should have been more clear and also asked the parent about making such a large book purchase. \nHowever finding caregivers for special needs children is hard. Depending on the needs of the child it can take months to over a year to rematch with a new caregiver. I'd pay the $50 to save the relationship with your caregiver. That is a great price on books for your child so it doesn't hurt you and you don't risk her looking for a different job. Caregivers are in high demand so she can easily find work elsewhere. Then make sure she knows this can't happen again and make a protocol for future purchases. Like if the purchase is under a certain amount, no authorization needed but if it is over she needs to check with you. Or that she already has a fun budget to spend on your child. If she goes over all purchases need to be approved by you or they will not be reimbursed in the future. Talk about communication needs for your daughter. If she will be continuing to buy books for your daughter and have your daughter pay her with her allowance than she needs to be clear on price and amount of books.

Tessa was being very thoughtful and you should appreciate that she thinks so much of Ruby that she looks for books for her. You\u2019re not the a h because that amount should have been cleared with you. However I would not let this damage the relationship.

Tessa should have confirmed the amount of books and the total price with you before purchasing them.

If OP was to say \"I really can't afford that, but let's work together on this\" and then say, look into re-selling some of the books on eBay, or having the nanny and her kid set up a bake sale or lemonade stand to raise the funds to pay for the books, that would be fine.

Buy tickets to a museum or a movie? The nanny has bought books for the kid before, the only difference here was the cost threshold went over some unstated line. And, it's fine for OP to say, \"hey, that actually crossed a budget line for me, let's set up more clarity in our agreements going forward\", but given that the books can't be easily returned, it feels way more appropriate to me for OP to bear the expense than the nanny, both because OP is clearly more financially able to do so than the nanny, and because costs associated with the kid are the parent's responsibility.", "Funny, our library says nothing published within the last year. \"older\" titles only.   \n\nCheck [worldcat.org](https://worldcat.org) for library availability.", "Yet, for many people, this kind of unexpected expense isn't something they can comfortably swing.\n\nExpecting her 12 year old autistic charge to pay for them is even more inappropriate.", "It's a lot to expect for a 12 year old to pay out of her allowance, in addition to not mentioning the staggering amount of books she was buying.", "This should be treated as a simple misunderstanding.

Something she had done - at least in kind, if not scale - without issue many times before.

Tessa was out of line and at the very least should have checked if the purchase was okay.", "NTA. she should\u2019ve cleared the price with you and ruby. she took it upon herself to get your daughter that many books. she wasn\u2019t asked to do this so you shouldn\u2019t have to compensate a random, and hefty, amount of money because she decided to splurge. she never asked you or ruby if you could cover it, so it\u2019s not your responsibility to pay that much. \n\nif i collected snow globes and someone asked me if i wanted one and i said yes, and then they brought back 7 and told me it was 100$ i would not pay them that money. they never actually asked me if i was ok with paying that amount. it\u2019s completely unexpected. \n\nit comes across as her intent being to gift ruby something but then telling her that it\u2019s not actually a gift and she has to pay for it. sneaking that price in and then being upset you don\u2019t want to pay it is ridiculous.", "NTA!!! She went above and beyond, which is sweet, but she\u2019s out of line to expect you to eat the cost of that. Had she asked, there\u2019s no way y\u2019all would have agreed to it AND what she purchased is 17-35 TIMES what she normally brings for your child.\n\nI don\u2019t really understand how someone can justify such a ridiculous purchase but I think it\u2019s because you used the word nanny and that painted a picture of who people think you are.", "So this is a bit hard. NTA but I feel simultaneously bad for the nanny and Ruby, and angry at the nanny. \n\nAt the very least, this nanny should have had to common sense to tell both Ruby and yourself the potential cost before making the purchase. \n\nIf this nanny is being provided as a service to your exceptional needs child, then I would think that there must be some policies in place to prohibit the exchange of money, both because she is a child, and because she has Autism.", "So I just want to point out because of the edits and most people probably not knowing this but this woman isn\u2019t a nanny. She\u2019s a DSP which stands for direct support provider. Two things about this that are relevant. The state pays her wages or a private company contracted with the state. It\u2019s possible this DSP actually makes more money than the mom here. Secondly at least with my company I\u2019m put in a very different tax bracket than most other people something like 25% of my wages aren\u2019t even listed as taxable income on my w2 and that is to account for any expenses incurred within the job. And according to my employers policy I\u2019m not to spend my own money and ask for compensation unless is was discussed with the parent prior to the purchase. My company will not compensate me for unapproved purchases and something like this without prior approval from the parent would fall under the \u2018gift\u2019 category and asking for compensation would get me fired. I obviously don\u2019t know this persons company policies but I imagine they\u2019re pretty similar. I am going to say NAH because this sounds like a misunderstanding but I\u2019m leaning towards the DSP being TA because she likely knows she is to be communicating with the parent and has disregarded that rule by asking only the daughter if purchases are ok.", "As a nanny of kids with well off parents, NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even do this and I know the parents would be able to afford it.\n\nI totally get the nanny wanting to do something nice for the daughter. She sounds thoughtful, and maybe just got carried away. \n\nHowever, going from usually picking up a few bucks worth of books to getting $50 worth is a huge jump. She definitely should have checked with Ruby about the cost, and then double checked with you, about whether or not you were ok with Ruby spending that much money. \n\nI also get that you as a single mom, and the nanny, as a student, are not in situations where taking a $50 hit is easy. \n\nMaybe the nanny can keep the books and Ruby can buy the books she wants from the nanny, instead of going to more bookstores together. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is evil in this situation. The nanny spent a lot of time picking out books for the daughter which is really sweet. However, a person can\u2019t expect a 12 year old to foot a $50 bill. \n\nMoving forward, explain this to the nanny and maybe have her check in about any purchases over a certain amount.", "NTA. Why would you try to charge a child for something? Seems rude to buy someone something (especially a child) and expecting reimbursement if she was the one who brought it up in the first place. She should\u2019ve asked you prior to getting the books if she wasn\u2019t going to gift them to your child. Everyone on here just assumes you have the $50 to spare, also that sounds expensive for thrifted books \ud83d\ude44 What if people went around buying unexpected gifts for other people just to asked to be paid back? Kinda derails the nice gesture.", "Honestly, the sitter should have checked before expecting that a 12 year old would have $50 at her disposal. I had a situation once where someone who was a professional photographer decided to take pictures at my mom's funeral (without asking my consent) and then proceeded to hand me the pics afterwards and demand payment. I was shocked but I paid for the photos even though I felt blindsided because I didn't want any drama.", "I realize this is an unpopular opinion, but NTA. Heavily NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is sweet that your nanny is dedicated to your child so much that she thinks of her when she's not working. It's great that they have such a lovely relationship. However, she should always ask you permission before purchasing something for your child with the expectation that the child would repay her. $50 is a lot of money to a child. Hell, it's a lot of money to me and I make a good living. \n\nHowever, I do agree with the other commenter who said sometimes it's better to salvage a good relationship than to be right. I would cover the cost - this time, and then make it clear that you'd appreciate a heads up for next time.", "I agree, NTA OP.\n\nI've worked with Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, such as Ruby, as part of my career for the past almost decade now, both as direct support to our clients and now as a case worker connecting our individuals and families to such services as OP describes Tessa is as a state funded care service provider (I'm assuming possibly respite services, if not IHSS)\n\nBut if this is a respite provider, this is one of the reasons there are policies these agencies have regarding money/gift exchanges, usually it's the other way around though, from family to provider.... But either way, as seen here, it can be messy. Some agencies allow for small gift exchanges of no more than like say $5 gifts, it's really dependent on the agency... But $50 would definitely not be okay and Tessa messed up by expecting this to be paid back, ESPECIALLY from Ruby, the client receiving this state funded service. And without consent from OP, Ruby's mother and legal guardian. This is just all bad on Tessa's part.", "wow reading the comments here is making me feel insane. How could you possibly think what the nanny did is okay. It\u2019s not about $50 it\u2019s about baiting a child. She didn\u2019t get her a gift? when you gift something you don\u2019t ask for payment.", "I'm so shocked that people say that she's an A/h because 50 is not that much and she's a \"cheap a hole\" These people are ridiculous! This is NTA, the nanny is an ah for doing this without talking to her first, that's a 12 year old child, not 15/16 teenager. I don't understand gringos, 50 is not something you can easily waste, especially since this service is being paid by the government, not by her own labor, she's a single mother ffs. Many of us didn't have an allowance, let alone 50 dollars!", "Sifting through comments for common sense is like panning for gold in Antarctica.", "This. It's like they completely overlook the fact that what the nanny did was wrong and only focus on the fact that she has a nanny. So she must have money that she can just blow it's so stupid. Doesn't make her an ah just because she doesn't want to pay the money that she wasn't aware was being spent?? You don't consult a child on this big of a purchase. \"Some books\" 35 isn't some. Whether OP can pay for it or not shouldn't be the main focus the focus should be why did nanny consult a child about that big of a purchase? Why didn't nanny talk to OP?? Most of all why did she only say \"some\" books when it was 35?", "You don\u2019t think there are waitlists for people looking for such care? Especially with how low paying such jobs usually are?", "She said it's a benefit from the state for her care. The nanny is paid by a seperate entity.", "My old thrift store has about 100 of those old ST books for about... $20. They've been there for months because nobody wants to buy them. It's sad.", "I know I would have quit, or more likely asked for a different client, one who had a heart and a brain....", "Per OP's edit the \"nanny\" is actually a government-funded caregiver. OP doesn't pay for the nanny, and I feel like if more people would have known that, they'd not be crapping on her so much about the $50 being an expense she considers too large.", "I think these commenters aren\u2019t putting any value on the relationships between nanny and child. I mean this nanny is thinking of this kid while she\u2019s on holiday. How does OP not understand how special and nice that is?", "Library book sales are the *best*!  I've found so many great gems I'd never have known existed at them, and it's also a great way to support your local library (and book culture in general -- when you're done with your own book, you can always donate it to a thrift store, shelter, school, or little free library and keep the circulation going!)", "You sure have a weird opinion of \u201cdecent person.\u201d I say a decent person checks with someone before they buy them something and go \u201cokay you owe me $50!\u201d"]}
