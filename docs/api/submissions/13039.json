Recently, she has gotten into the original Star Trek show, as well as the Next Generation. Ruby is also a big reader and has started to collect a few of the old Star Trek books that she finds in used bookstores and thrift stores. These books usually cost anywhere from 50 cents to a couple of dollars. \n\nMy nanny, Tessa (f22), hangs out with Ruby most days after she gets out of school. Tessa has been our nanny for over a year now and she and Ruby get along great. Tessa is big into to thrifting and will often keep an eye out for the books Ruby wants. This is not typically a problem and Ruby always pays Tessa back for the books using her allowance.\n\nThe problem occurred when Tessa went on a family vacation out west. Apparently she went thrifting during this trip and found some books for Ruby. She texted Ruby asking her if she wanted the books and Ruby said yes. \n\nWell Tessa returned yesterday with a stack of about 35 books and told Ruby they cost $50. Ruby doesn't have this much money and told Tessa. Tessa then asked me if I would cover the cost. I said no as Tessa had never asked me about buying Ruby the books, nor was I aware of the conversation between the two of them. Tessa got upset and I asked Ruby to show me the text which made no mention of price, or even the amount of books she was buying. Tessa only said that she found \"some\" books for Ruby. Ruby is on the autism spectrum and does not read between the lines. You have to be very literal with her. \n\nPreviously, Tessa has never bought Ruby more than one or two books at a time, so I told her that she should have clarified with Ruby regarding the amount, or double checked with me before purchasing, and that I would not be paying the $50. Tessa said she could not return the books because they came from the thrift store. I stood firm in my decision and reiterated that she should have asked me first. \n\nTessa left and Ruby is very upset. I know Tessa is a student and does not have a ton of money so am I the asshole for not paying Tessa for the books?\n\nEDIT: Because some people are asking- I am a single parent to Ruby and while $50 dollars will not make or break the bank, it is definitely an unexpected expense. I provide Tessa with an extra amount of money each month to spend on whatever she wants to do with Ruby (movies, the mall, etc).

Don't forget to thank the nanny for thinking about your daughter while on her vacation.\n\nEdit:  Typo", "I'm guessing if they can afford a nanny, they can afford a one time unexpected $50.", "I agree, I used to be a nanny and I\u2019d occasionally pick up little gifts for the kid\u2026 I would never expect to be reimbursed for them and therefore wouldn\u2019t spend that much on them. I get that they sort of had a system but $50 worth of books is a big assumption.", "If you can afford a nanny, the answer is yes.", "I'm going to go with \"yes\". A nanny, especially for a 12 y/o, is a luxury.  I was a latch key kid at that age. We have a nanny, and she is very expensive (and well-worth it). OP shouldn't be paying her nanny so little that the nanny is hard-up for $50. Even with as much as we pay our nanny and pay for her health insurance,  I'd reimburse her.", "My parents hardly ever gave me money, but every year I walked out with the biggest stack.  My parents never stringed if it was reading or educational.  To me, because it was books it seemed more reasonable.", "My last family actually made me the god mother ( I was with him from 2 weeks old ( premature) to 4 years, and were still close now even though I haven\u2019t worked for them in some time). I had and still have legal guardianship papers ( his parents traveled often for work and sometimes I\u2019d have him for weeks at a time and they wanted me to be able to take him abroad if necessary)\u2026 while I know this isn\u2019t typical, every single family I ever worked for considered me family and even though I was paid initially I stayed in contact with my kids thereafter\u2026. Working in someone\u2019s home, with their most loved, adored beings is unlike almost any other job.\n\nI feel most parents would actually really value this nanny who clearly is going above and beyond. I just can\u2019t imagine running into this situation as it\u2019s never been the case in my experience.\n\nMy families went above and beyond to show gratitude. Great salary, health care, holiday bonuses, stocked the house with groceries I like ( and we had very different diets) etc. I can\u2019t imagine them even flinching if I asked for anything to be reimbursed.\n\nFor reference, my closest family in nyc gave me and my husband an apartment. She was a school teacher- they weren\u2019t wealthy, but they had a duplex and because I started with the girls at 6am, taught, and then had them after school until 7 or 8 just wanted to make my life a little easier. They weren\u2019t  millionaire\u2019s,  but where they had wiggle room to show gratitude, they did.", "by the gods yes! And! if these are the star trek series books? even better of a steal! these are considered \"sci-fi classics\" by todays standards! You wouldn't likely find 35 books for $50 if you were looking at say 2nd and charles (amazing thrift store near me. love them but these are at least 5 bucks a book), or any discount store. \n\nif the seller knew what they could sell for? They would've upped the price even more so if they were in good/amazing condition. These books arent exactly in print daily or in walmart anymore. The nanny did amazing on this find! and if Ruby keeps well care of them she could potentially sell them at a later date (when shes say 18+ and wants to) for a decent amount", "A single mom that can afford a nanny, for 12 y/o. I sure as hell couldn't afford a nanny when I was a single mom with no child support. I struggled to pay my babysitter.", "Excellent! It\u2019s wonderful to learn new things.", "I meant is $50 worth all this drama, not if the books were worth $50.", "But thats guessing. Maybe the nanny is a necessary but carefully budgeted for expense. \n\nRegardless the nanny should not expect to be reimbursed $50 when it wasnt pre agreed with the parent. Yes its nice to pick something up for the kid, but thats excessive. \n\nIf i could easily afford to cover it i would, but id  make clear that if they were planning to buy things for my child that needed to be paid back in future, they need to run it by me first, not the child\n\n*edited error", "Not necessarily if OP is already setting aside an extra fund for Tessa to do things with Ruby", "Yeah, we love our nanny. She is someone that has full run of my home and is entrusted with our kids; we want her to be happy. When I had my first child, I was very young and very poor; I  struggled to afford a babysitter and even then, I treated my babysitter as well as I could. I'd stock things she liked, before buying treats for myself. The people who you trust with your kids ought to be treated well.", "So because she can afford a nanny, therefore she now has to fork out $50 when the nanny doesn't get permission and baits a twelve year old with stuff that she likes? I seriously don't get how people think that this is okay. I'd be furious if someone did this to a child of mine. Like if it was $10, fine, but $50? \n\nBut my recommendation to OP is to get rid of the nanny so that'll save her a lot in the long run.", "Yeah, like how some people on this sub have no empathy for a single parent whose nanny was inappropriate and overstepped.", "lmao sorry i see that now. they definitely should\u2019ve just paid for the books it\u2019s so silly", "All that is fine, I'm not saying that the nanny shouldn't have run this all by the parent.  The issue I'm having is that all this can and should have been an easy fix.  Pay the $50 for the books, have a conversation on how in the future she should contact the parent about larger purchases, and move on with life.  \n\nIt's a cost/benefit calculation.  Is a great Nanny, a happy kid, and your kid getting something they really like worth $50?  I'd say yes.  The only thing that would change my mind is if the parent legitimately couldn't afford it but I'd have to see something really convincing on that because if you can afford a Nanny, I'm sure a one off $50 expense isn't going to break you, or anything close to that.", "Nope. Especially when your kid is 12, there are much cheaper options for after school care then a nanny. If she has one, she is financially secure enough to cough up an extra $50 on occasion.", "My mom used to pay my sitter in food stamps. I totally get it. I just feel if you have the means to have a nanny you can spare 50 bucks especially to a college kid who probably is eating ramen right now. So many childcare workers are so checked out, a good one is worth it.", "She\u2019s a single mom who can afford a nanny for her twelve year old. She\u2019s doing fine. And it\u2019s not \u2018inappropriate\u2019 to thoughtfully bring books for her child that she\u2019d love.", "It's all good.  I'd be super excited to get 35 books for $50....especially star trek books (yeah....I'm a trekkie lol)", "Ooof. I don't know if it has changed since I was in college,  but I remember crying and crying when I found out that my academic scholarships counted towards income in the state I went to school. The Pell grant and loans didn't count, but my academic scholarships put me over the limit for food stamps. I adore my eldest, but damn I made some not awesome choices when I was young.", "???\n\nThis is like saying \"They put their kid in private school, they must be fine.\" It's an assumption and completely baseless. Plenty of people stretch their budgets to the breaking point to provide for their kids. If OP deemed the nanny necessary (especially as a single parent), chances are that $50 can mean a LOT some months.\n\nEspecially since the nanny ALREADY gets extra money to spend on items and activities for the daughter and blew through it/isn't using it for the books.\n\nIt's not inappropriate to purchase a *gift* for a child that she'd love. It is **highly** inappropriate to purchase several \"gifts\" for the child and then CHARGE THE CHILD MONEY FOR THEM.\n\nReminder that the nanny didn't ask ***mom*** for money, she asked the ***12-year-old*** for $50.", "Lol there is nothing 'thoughtful' about baiting a child with something that they want and then going 'oh yeah now you owe me $50'. This sub drives me bonkers sometimes. \n\nIf you want to 'thoughtfully bring books' for a kid, *ask their parents*. It's not that difficult. And OP being able to afford a nanny has nothing to do with whether or not they should fork out the $50 for something they didn't ask for or want.", "seriously! and the excitement of someone else picking them out, so you don\u2019t know what to expect, and you get kind of an inside view of someones perception of you", "I can\u2019t imagine living with the level of paranoia that would lead you to assume she was \u2018baiting\u2019 this child. Best of luck to you."]}
