My kids attend school and need their sleep (they have a decent bedtime) I\u2019ll also add I have a hard time telling people no (currently in therapy for that among other issues) \n\nBecause of those reasons, when she came to me saying she had a job offer she asked which of 2 schedules worked for me. Didn\u2019t ask if I would be the babysitter. I told her neither did. So we agreed to a schedule where I\u2019d watch him half the schedule and her parents would watch him the other.

My MIL then messaged me telling me she\u2019s going to straighten me out and that if my nephew is such a bother then I just won\u2019t keep him anymore. She also told me I\u2019m an awful person for screwing over my sister and she expected more from me . \n\nMy husband agrees with me but won\u2019t say anything to his mom and sister. AITA?

I\u2019ve read the comments and your responses and this is just ridiculous. The first thing I think you should do is find out when story time is at your nearest public libraries and you\u2019re going to start having regular appointments throughout the week. You and your laptop can sit where you can see story time while you get the chance to work on school a little while your little one is happily distracted.

I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re in the US because of the times you mentioned and I believe that all 50 states have programs connected to Medicaid and Food Stamps and similar programs that pay for daycare costs while you\u2019re working or going to school for low income households.

The kid lives in a house with 3 adults and he\u2019s already pawned off on you all the time?! You did not agree to parenting another kid. Just read your comments about diapers and leaving him until 2 AM, and my mind is blown. I grew up learning family helps family, but it\u2019s her fault that you can\u2019t trust when it\u2019s actually a childcare emergency because she\u2019s taken advantage of you so many times.", "NTA but your husband needs to stick up for you wtf", "NTA. Respond to MIL: \u201cdon\u2019t threaten me with a good time.\u201d And wtf is up with the veiled threat? Is she going to hurt you?", "NTA. Wow, you need to go NC with MIL and SIL.  Anyone who would threaten you isn't worth your time. That is just disgusting behavior from them. Tell your spineless husband either stick up for you or your walking. You have friends or family that is nice don't you?? Please get some help from them, and a place to go. It makes me so upset that they are so mean to you. Especially a lousy husband that cares nothing for you.", "Giving notice by caving does not show she's serious. Arbitrary deadlines that can be walked over mean nothing.", "Right? OP has mentioned in a comment that this isn't the first time husband has kept quiet about something and also not the worst. Seems like hubby is either a spineless coward or is taking advantage of OP just as much as his family. Definitely a massive red flag \ud83d\udea9", "Don't know where you live OP but in the states the government helps pay for child care. Tell your SIL to go apply as you have your own responsibilities and it isn't reasonable for you to be her full time sitter.", "lock the doors and close the blinds/curtains and ignore them. disconnect the doorbell if you have one. if they knock and yell turn up the tv/music and lock yourself in another room to study.  \n\n\nyour husband is a TERRIBLE husband. the inlaws match him", ">He thinks that it\u2019s \u2018childish drama\u2019 and that it just needs to be worked out.\n\nAsk him if he'll be ok if your mom or dad told him they'll \"straighten him out\" if he didn't do something they ask him to do?", "It does need to be worked out...by him growing up and talking to his family.", "Any opportunity for you and you husband to move? Being next door to this madness can\u2019t be good for the situation and even moving across town might be better.", "You and husband should move.\n\nThis will continue as long as you are both convenient and a total pushover.  The pushover part doesn't appear to be changing any time soon."]}
