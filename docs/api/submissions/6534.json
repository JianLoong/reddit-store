I\u2019ve read the comments and your responses and this is just ridiculous. The first thing I think you should do is find out when story time is at your nearest public libraries and you\u2019re going to start having regular appointments throughout the week. You and your laptop can sit where you can see story time while you get the chance to work on school a little while your little one is happily distracted.

I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re in the US because of the times you mentioned and I believe that all 50 states have programs connected to Medicaid and Food Stamps and similar programs that pay for daycare costs while you\u2019re working or going to school for low income households.

He probably goes to his mother and say she is right and he just don\u2019t want to get involved.\n\nThat is 2 faced behavior.

There is more than 1 POV and perspective in each situation/argument and not choosing a side is never choosing side \"A\" or \"B\" no matter what side you're on. \n\nBiggest example I can think of is with voting. The left says by not voting you are supporting the right...the right says that by not voting you are supporting the left. Its hypocritical and borderline bully like behavior to tell someone \"by not taking my side you are taking their side\" when someone does not want to be involved. You are forcing their involvement.
