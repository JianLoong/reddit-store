My kids attend school and need their sleep (they have a decent bedtime) I\u2019ll also add I have a hard time telling people no (currently in therapy for that among other issues) \n\nBecause of those reasons, when she came to me saying she had a job offer she asked which of 2 schedules worked for me. Didn\u2019t ask if I would be the babysitter. I told her neither did. So we agreed to a schedule where I\u2019d watch him half the schedule and her parents would watch him the other.

My MIL then messaged me telling me she\u2019s going to straighten me out and that if my nephew is such a bother then I just won\u2019t keep him anymore. She also told me I\u2019m an awful person for screwing over my sister and she expected more from me . \n\nMy husband agrees with me but won\u2019t say anything to his mom and sister. AITA?

I\u2019ve read the comments and your responses and this is just ridiculous. The first thing I think you should do is find out when story time is at your nearest public libraries and you\u2019re going to start having regular appointments throughout the week. You and your laptop can sit where you can see story time while you get the chance to work on school a little while your little one is happily distracted.

I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re in the US because of the times you mentioned and I believe that all 50 states have programs connected to Medicaid and Food Stamps and similar programs that pay for daycare costs while you\u2019re working or going to school for low income households.

Anyone who would threaten you isn't worth your time. That is just disgusting behavior from them. Tell your spineless husband either stick up for you or your walking.

NO is your best friend, OP.  No!  And don\u2019t ever ask them for anything because it will be used against you!  Just No.  You need to do this, not just for you but for your children.
