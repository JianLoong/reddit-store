No one should have to live life expecting people's faces pressed against the windows of their house.

I did this on our screened in porch as it is also all glass and then I just cut a hole at eye level to look out of! Works great as it's the perfect width so I only have to cut the length!

Sweet you was on your own property in a bit of a stressful situation, if the child got hurt it wouldn\u2019t be about what you was wearing or that you screamed in shock, it would be the fact he didn\u2019t properly monitor his child and they got hurt.", "Further, if this child is ND, then the father is teaching him that this behaviour is acceptable, a lesson he will take into adulthood. While it\u2019s somewhat easier to pawn it off as \u201che\u2019s a little kid\u201d it is much more consequential when he\u2019s a teenager or adult.\n\nTrespassing and anti-voyeur laws exist. When your child is ND, you have to work harder to ensure they grow up to function as capably as possible in society and not set them up to become criminals just because they like climbing up other people\u2019s stairs and gawking in windows.", "And a large dog. Usually they are a good deterrent.", "Or plastering his face into one of their young daughters rooms because he has not been taught any better.", "So because you have personal boundaries. Your the bad guy. \n\nThere is a reason this is called trespassing and it\u2019s a crime.\nMost people do not want others on their front porch at 7 in the morning much less them locking in the windows. \n\nAnd this may not be an issue for the 4 year old to do this but what happens when he thinks he can do this at 18 because he want taught that you don\u2019t go on other\u2019s property or look through their windows? \n\nDo you think if the 18 year old does it charges won\u2019t be filed? \n\nThe dad is doing his son a disservice. The son may be disabled but still needs to know right and wrong.", "This 100 percent. This may be ok for a 4 year old but not for an 18 year old.", "Honestly OP should talk to the rest of the families in their neighborhood using these concerns and showing concern for the boy. Basically flip the script.

I do it for my daughter. Just not on other people's porches....", "I think think this a case of the father not having any manners himself to pass along to his son.", "NTA. What's the rhyme?

Dad needs to learn to fucking parent before his kid gets blasted by the wrong person.", "NTA Window licking is not only gross but definitely not how you endear a child to the new neighbours.", "NTA, but only because it's your right to keep others off your property.\n\nYTA because you never did anything about the completely see-through door until now and you pranced downstairs without pants.

Congrats on alienating all your new neighbors.", "NTA. Get a stairgate.", "NTA. I would be explaining to the neighbors that if that kid takes a header off those stairs you don\u2019t want the liability for it. Guaranteed he would try to get as much as he could for it. Also him sticking his face into a window is being a peeping Tom not ok at all", "You need to post no trespassing.", "NTA. This is a great way for him to get some PT exercises into his daily life, IF he had asked the neighbors he knows well(which it sounds like is most of them), respected \u201cno\u201d if it came, and waited to get to know any new neighbors before asking them.", "Nta. Also, don't replace the door, which is  most like original. If it's how I'm envisioning, you can get a French door curtain to cover up the glass. Much cheaper, faster, and easier.", "NTA. The father said his child had only a \"motor\" delay, and you believed him.\n\nBut if you want the get on the right side of the rest of the neighborhood, discuss the situation from a position of concern, curiosity and \"seeking advice\".

Ask them whether the child is verbal and how they talk to it.", "NTA\n\nAt the very least, before the child every climbed your steps after you moved in, the dad should have come over, introduced himself, explained the situation, and *asked* if it was okay for his kid to walk up and down your steps.\n\nWe moved into a new house when I was a kid, and one day a bunch of official police \u201cdo not park here\u201d signs went up all over the street. And a neighbor we hadn\u2019t met yet came over, introduced himself, and explained that he hosted a big party for everyone who worked for his company once a year, and the police signs were to keep the street clear for his guests to park. \n\nHe was very nice about it, it was once a year, no big deal. But if he hadn\u2019t said anything, my parents probably would have been far more annoyed by the takeover of the street that Saturday.", "NTA however I have a mentally challenged daughter and I don't understand why she does some things but I appreciate kind hearted people.", "NTA. What's next? Can my child paint on your sidewalk to help with some skill? Can my kids PLAY on your porch? My kid fell on your stairs! My kid smacked into the door! HOW DARE YOU HAVE A DOOR!  It won't stop. Private property is private property. Screw the neighbors and their cold shoulders. You didn't buy your house to be friends with them.", "Have your dog take a dump on his steps, and then tell him he does it to improve his gross poop skills.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nWhat would've happened if you scared the kid when you screamed, he tripped on your steps and cracked his head open? You bet your ass the father would be suing the crap out of you.\n\nYou have the right to keep unwanted people off your property. FFS if everyone else is ok with it, then let him climb on their steps.
