It has a huge covered brick front porch reached by 5 steps.   Our front door is plate glass and wood and totally clear and faces a heavily trafficked sidewalk since we live downtown.  I\u2019m explaining this to show how big our porch is and how our door isn\u2019t right up on the street.  One morning I was rushing to get out the door with the kids and was rushing around downstairs with no pants on.  I was in the living room, looked into the foyer and see this four year old plastering his face against my glass door.  I screamed and grabbed the blanket on the sofa.  Kid then left.  I ran to put on pants.\n\nFive minutes later a grown man rings my bell and explains to me when I open the door that is his son.  His son is delayed in gross motor so while he walks him down the street to daycare he lets him climb everyone\u2019s stairs as therapy while he waits on sidewalk.  He\u2019s letting me know this because we are new and he heard the scream.\n\nI told the guy I want the kid kept off my stairs and porch as it\u2019s private property, I don\u2019t want the financial liability, or the privacy invasion (we do plan on replacing the door asap).  Guy got mad and said some rude things then left.\n\nThe street has lots of families.  They all know each other and socialize.  We\u2019ve gotten the cold shoulder apparently because of my reaction to the boy climbing my porch steps.  \n\nWas I wrong?  I think it\u2019s too late to apologize.

You are absolutely correct about liability and privacy. Wow. What is he doing.", "NTA\n\nIt's your private property.", "NTA. Your neighbor imposed without asking. You said NO. You are not TA for saying no.\n\nAnd whether wise or not, you were within reason to express that no in no uncertain terms to someone who took a substantial liberty, however polite he was in stopping by to explain the situation. I think you got some equivalent of the \"nice guy\" treatment. Just because someone is \"nice\", or even popular, does not mean you owe him anything.", "NTA. The father should be teaching his son to respect other people's property.", "NTA. I should think the scream he heard would have given him the message you had to put into words. The neighbourhood will forgive and forget as they get to know you.", "And when the child with the poor motor skills takes a header off your stairs and gets hurt, who's going to get sued? \n\nI'm sorry for the kid's difficulties, but your front porch isn't a physical therapy facility.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It would be different if he had asked permission first but instead he lets his kid tramp up and down your front steps and peep through your door like you weren\u2019t total fucking strangers. The entitlement is strong with that guy.", "NTA- it's one thing if he came to talk to you ahead of time, and just asked if it was ok.  (I personally would have still said no ) but to just assume it's ok for his kid to climb everyone's stairs and look in the door...nope!", "NTA. Your porch is not a jungle gym, and it's completely reasonable to want your private property respected. Just because the father uses it as a therapy exercise doesn't mean it's fair game for everyone. It's like going to a buffet and finding someone's been using your plate for weightlifting. Boundaries matter, folks.", "NTA. The father has plenty of options in teaching his child a wide range of skills--including respecting other people's property.\n\nThe boy doesn't need to climb everyone's stairs.\n\nHomeowner's liability is real.\n\nThe father is an AH for doing this to everyone without permission, and any neighbors who shun you for protecting yourself from obvious liability are also AHs.", "NTA. But being right is not always the best option, if you want to make friends in the new neighborhood. When living in society, you have to make compromises ir at the very least, explain why not. You enjoy your privacy, well and good, as it is your right. But, you could have handled the situation in a much more elegant manner.", "NAH\n\nEh, you don't want neighborhood kids on your stairs or porch.\n\nWish granted. \n\nApparently, the whole neighborhood now knows. \n\nIf this is how you really feel, do nothing. \n\nIf you don't feel this way, go talk to the neighbor knocked on your door. \n\nOnly you can fix this.", "YTA kids will do what kids will do. The neighborhood is obviously friendly with you being the exception. You were surprised and a little embarrassed. Why take it out on a child. You were the one running around pantsless in front of a glass window facing the street. You are lucky it was a 4 yr old.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
