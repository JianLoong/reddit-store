Between her and my step daughter, they were talking about a man that she has carpooled with for about two years. It started off saying that he was so depressed after she stopped talking to him for 3 days, that he got really depressed and lost 7 lbs in those 3 days. My stepdaughter said \u201cthat would be cringe, if it weren\u2019t for the relationship you guys had, that\u2019s cute\u201d. \nMy stepdaughter then told her that if he makes her happy, she should go for it. My wife then said there\u2019s too much at stake with our 4 year old son, and the house we own together. She said that they met at the wrong time, and maybe down the road they would get together. \n\nI was absolutely devastated. I texted her and told her that her bags were packed, she needed to find another place to live, and that our son would be staying with me. \n\nWhen she got home, we talked about what happened, and she admitted that it was an emotional affair, but nothing physical happened. She has been feeling depressed for some time, and liked the attention that she was getting from this man. Things that night ended rather amicable, and we agreed that we would go to counselling and work on our issues. \n\nThe next day, I wanted to hurt this man who was trying to get with my wife. I wanted to make sure he would stay away. I went to his house (got address from a mutual friend), not sure who I would find. His wife was sitting on the porch and I explained the situation and showed her the pictures of the texts I took. We talked for awhile, and I left. \n\nMy wife called shortly after and I told her where I went. She came home angry that I disrupted her work life. She said that people would talk. She felt like this was a direct attack in her in retaliation for what she had done. I told her this was not my intention, but that I wanted to hurt him and keep him away. She has decided that I was too spiteful and petty just to leave things how they were between us and has begun looking for apartments. \n\nI did want her to feel like there was consequences for cheating, but I did not intend to ruin her reputation at work. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1689724277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153elg9/aita_for_telling_my_cheating_wifes_other_mans/", "score": 445, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s funny the wife is mad now that OTHER people will talk about it. \n\nIf you were ever cheated on, you want to know. Most people have that reaction.  Who knows if you have but MOST want to know. This man is not an asshole. He told someone the truth about a situation that their spouses dragged them into. She deserved to know. \n\nWho was gonna handle it? The ones that emotionally cheated? Emotional cheating is sharing secrets and telling things.
