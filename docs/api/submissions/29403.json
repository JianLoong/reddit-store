How about NOT stressing her out with this huge responsibility and not stressing him out with the fear he'll be unable to arrive on time or be stuck there because she's freaking out?? I know I know, I'm bonkers on this one but let's make her be in charge of picking up the weekly groceries and let him be able to focus on having CANCER.", "NTA!

I get that she's got OCD but he's also dealing with a disease that can be terminal. He needs rest and care.", "NTA - OCD is a serious condition, but she is responsible for managing it. He has to focus on his own, potentially fatal, condition.\n\nFrom your other comments, it sounds like he did respond to her several times, just not *every* time. And she blamed him for not managing her condition properly while he was getting cancer treatment.\n\nHe needs a safe environment, reliable access to his treatments, and as little stress as possible. If his family can\u2019t give him that, then they should be grateful that somebody else is willing to.", "Edit: to NAH because this situation is just messy and honestly nobody is winning here. Sorry for my assumptions, I just assumed that Dani was already receiving some level of directional support hence being told to accompany you both, but seems not. Definitely not your responsibility and I misread the tone of the post. Parents should apologise.\n\n~~~\n\nYTA\n\nI can understand Lee is going through a quite a hard time, but Dani has OCD and I think actively disrespecting someone's OCD is bad. Or it could of at least been handled better.\n\nOCD to put it lightly, is traumatic. I don't speak from first hand experience, but a big part of OCD is \"Intrusive Thoughts\" which I would assume is why Dani was contacting you both so much. They NEED reassurance because otherwise very traumatic thoughts will constantly replay over and over in their mind until they \"Resolve\" it through rituals, reassurance, etc. \n\nIf you're unsure of what an Intrusive Thought is, think of the worst thing possible but you're 100% convinced it will happen to your loved ones and you can't escape those thoughts and they haunt you until you do x action. You have 0 control over it. Hence the diagnosis, people do experience mild Intrusive Thoughts without OCD. Keyword, mild.\n\nI don't think you're evil, you were just looking out for Lee and I'm unsure if there's another abbreviation that would suit this better (Will edit accordingly). But pulling Lee away from Dani and forbidding her from resolving her mental turmoil, KNOWING she has OCD. That's like pushing over someone you know is disabled and can't pick themselves back up and leaving them there. \n\nI would say you should probably apologise, if you don't want to, just try to be more compassionate, yeah?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's going to be having so many things to think about he doesn't need to be stressed out by someone else.  Stepmom is TA. Dani obviously isn't ready for this responsibility. You're supporting him by standing up for him, giving him a safe place, and providing comfort. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\nCancer treatment is often devastating physically. Plus psychologically straining as you willingly have poisonous meds injected into your body. Lee needs, and deserves, all the support possibly available.\n\nHis mom's thinking/planning is bizarre. Why she would use his treatment as a litmus test for Dani's ability to cope is beyond me. Dani also deserves all the help that she can get, but harassing her brother while he has treatment isn't support. She texted him roughly every 6 \u00bd minutes for four hours. No matter how ill she is, it's just not on him to meet her needs. \n\nI hope Lee decides to stay with you as long as he needs to and that his treatment is 100% successful.", "Nta? Lee isn't helping Dani? How about Dani helping Lee, you know, the person with freaking cancer? I'm glad you are there for him and got him to a safe place! Many virtual hugs to Lee!", "Honestly this makes the most sense and makes me question why Dani was even ordered to deal with a very ill person. Just seems like an amazing way to trigger OCD and an amazing way to cause stress to Lee who has a condition that is affected by stress.\n\nEveryone is getting hurt. I hope they're all okay.", "His dad is cool but he is out of town most of the time for work. Dani and her mum are verifiably CRAZY. Lee's very good at ignoring their nonsense but I CANNOT.", "I'm going to disagree, at least with the sister. OP is NTA but OCD is just....like this (I have OCD and her triggers overlap with mine) and it really sucks. but the treatment is actually learning how to ignore the compulsions because whatever you've convinced yourself of isn't actually Real", "Okay but her mental health isn't more important than his cancer treatments. Sure, he can respond to her texts but if you're answering the same texts again and again for 4hrs, you'd get tired too. He is getting a treatment. She clearly needs to find another way to get treated instead of making her brother be her guinea pig for it.", "I don't think the person sitting in a chair getting lethal poison injected into them should be responsible for helping Dani with her intrusive thoughts. Yes, her mental health is debilitating. I don't think it's fair to make someone else who is sick responsible for resolving someone else's mental turmoil. She can do that in so many other ways.", "As someone who has clinically diagnosed OCD with multiple themes and was in inpatient treatment and high risk outpatient treatment centres doing THOUSANDS of hours of therapy you are right about it being traumatic but you are so wrong at the same time because her doing that and then OP friend responding and \u201chelping\u201d her OCD actually feeds it and makes it worse like that is going AGAINST therapy/ treatment recommendations which is exposure therapy and NO ONE should be the ones in charge of it besides your therapist and you. \nSo she was actually making her OCD worse and feeding it and they were actually not feeding it! If she continues to feed it her OCD WILL get worse and manifest and spiral.", "OCD is rough, but so is cancer treatment. Dani's behaviour was inappropriate and her family's response was too.", "I would say NTA since the stepmother thought of this little plan.  It is stupid and deeply inconsiderate to put  Dani in this position and then call out the cancer patient for \"failing\".\n\nI watched my father die of pancreatic cancer for over a year.  I saw what chemo did to him in the brief time he was on it.  Expecting him to deal with anyone else's illness but his own was never on the table.", "I told their mum that, since she was the master planner, she set them both up for failure and she didn't take kindly to that.", "You should talk to his dad, because those actions are unjustifiable and intolerable, especially in this delicate and difficult situation.", "How about a middle ground opinion: Cancer is terrible in many ways. OCD is terrible in many ways. These are two individually sick people who should not be responsible for helping the other while they can't.", "I respect your opinion, but I don't share it. We talk about cancer, not about a trifle and I think it should have his place, for the difficult moment it is going through.", "That's the issue, she isn't ignoring the compulsions. (Fellow mild OCD haver, you have to willfully turn it off and I describe it as feeling similar to a random person forcing themselves to stay underwater because \"they can totally not drown\" since when you're trying to stop your irrational rituals/tics/\"requirements\" giving into your compulsion sorta feels to me like breaking the surface and taking that big gulp of air, even if it makes zero sense.)", "That's not how OCD works unfortunately. I wish it was, but it's just one of those things hence why I wasn't so keen on calling either an AH and wanted a different term.\n\nIf someone is incapable of texting back, they're incapable of texting back. If someone NEEDS reassurance, they NEED reassurance.\n\nBut for awareness, OCD is wildly misunderstood. People forget they're not neurotypical, it's a neurodivergeant condition that requires additional care just like Autism or ADHD. It's really hard to deal with, don't get me wrong and there's no definitive way of making it \"better\". There's no definitive therapy that works or anything. \n\nSo telling them to \"Deal with it\" is really harmful. If they have to, they'll have to, what needs must, but having an attitude of \"I don't care about your OCD\" (Not to say that's what OP thinks) erks me.", "Hence why I was wondering if there's a lesser term than calling either of you AHs. I don't think Lee is at fault, but neither is Dani. Unfortunately there are no \"other ways\" of handling OCD. There are very specific rituals/reassurance methods that they have and if it isn't accomplished then that's just that. Unresolved. Some people have OCD which involves rituals such as checking doors, taps, hobs etc out of irrational fear of robberies or house fires. For some others they need reassurance because they're convinced someone is going to die, so they constantly ask how you're feeling so that they know you're not gonna die sort of thing.\n\nI don't think you or Lee are evil at all. OCD is really difficult to work with and many psychologists aren't actually allowed to work with people with OCD because CBT methods often make it worse. If a psychologist isn't able, I'm definitely not expecting the average person to be able depending on the severity. (Sometimes it isn't too bad! Just a wildly misunderstood diagnosis). Unfortunately Intrusive Thoughts don't really \"Go away\". \n\nIt's just one of those things that could have been handled better (Giving her reassurance) but as you said, having treatment is really rough and he's in a hard place so it's not exactly his #1 priority. I guess I just tonally got the impression that neither of you cared which is pushing me more towards the AH route. However, if I misunderstand, I'll change it.\n\nI hope Lee is doing okay though and thank you for taking good care of him. I wish I could give some advice, but if you're both trying your best, then neither are AHs.\n\nEdit based on other comments: Dani doesn't have a treatment plan so giving reassurance may actually be detrimental. I assumed it was alright since the mother argued they should have given reassurance, and I'd assume the mother would know about Dani's mental health needs.", "Also... what are they going to do if he throws up? Starts running a fever? Thankfully neither have happened yet but Dani, IMO, cannot handle being around Lee while he's sick, and they made it clear that they are going to somehow make Lee responsible for her.", "Good to hear from someone with OCD! \n\nMy brother has OCD and my guess is it would be different depending on the person/type. From my own anecdotal experience with my brother, he needs reassurance. It may just be because my brother has a comorbid condition with Anxiety, Autism and Tourettes but he has many rituals and needs reassurance otherwise he tics like crazy and it causes him physical harm and makes him very... Aggressive. \n\nHowever, I would assume if the parent is making Dani tag along and is permitting her to ask these questions/telling Lee and his friend off for not answering... Then she does need the reassurance as part of her therapy for whatever reason? I guess it's a bad assumption to make, so that's my bad. Apologies to OP if that's not her therapy plan, in which case, they're doing the right thing.", "I think the problem people have when it comes to conditions such as OCD is that they expect people with OCD to act like neurotypical people. However they can't, they're neurodiverse and are often incapable of controlling their OCD. That doesn't apply to everyone with OCD, but it's actually one of the most common conditions that doesn't have a \"cure\" or definitive treatment method.\n\nIt's not so much about who's more or less important, it's just recognising someone's needs and trying to fulfill both. I defo don't think Lee should have been yelled at because if he's unable, he's unable. But the \"I'm not going to apologise\" is what gets me personally. I could be interpreting the tone wrong though.", "Truth hurts.", "I should've been clear that that's my feeling.\n\nI hope chemo goes well for your friend and yeah he needs a break from his family", "I was more arguing with your point that the family is \"psychopaths with zero rational capacity.\" She overstepped and was wrong, I'm not saying she isn't lmao", "She got reassurance. He messaged her back the first several times. When she kept asking the same things is when he stopped.\n\nI think the term you're looking for is NAH (no assholes here).\n\nNo one told her to deal with it, but essentially Dani and her mum were telling Lee to \"deal with it\" and respond back 38+ times.", "Lol I have ADHD so definitely not neurotypical. It can erk you but also while he's in a treatment, he shouldn't have to also be treating his sister's OCD. I think OP and friend are doing what's best for the friend. The sister's parents may do what's best for her. I understand there's no \"getting better\" but the brother shouldn't be forced to help his sister while he's in treatment. Its wrong.", "Why are you speaking on behalf of those of us with OCD when further up thread you say you don't have firsthand experience?", "I'll be the first to admit I am not a fan of Dani or her mum (they treat people around them like shit often) but I care about them as people. In the moment though they needed to be called out. I mean, imagine chemo being the least stressful part of your day because your \"family\" is prioritizing one member's health over the other's. That's not acceptable, IMO.", "He's not her nursemaid, her doctor, her partner, or her parent. He is in **NO** way responsible for reassuring her. None.\n\nHe is a *very* young, deeply ill, young man. Adding Dani's issues to his pile isn't the answer in any way shape or form. If she can't handle his 4 hour treatment he's honestly better off away from her.", "I don't think she has a therapy plan, which is part of the problem. I feel for her, I really do, but there are things that shouldn't be accepted. Like, there was literally no, \"how are you feeling, did the infusion go well?\" It went straight to, \"It was really unfair of you to leave Dani hanging for hours like that when all you had to do was text her back.\"", "NAH would make more sense! Thanks.", "He definitely doesn't need to be forced to \"help her\", it's moreso the mention of an argument and the \"I'm not going to apologise\" - It tonally just seems like a total disregard for someone else's feelings.\n\nHowever, I also realise that not apologising doesn't mean a total disregard, but can mean \"I'm not responsible for this person, and I don't want to become responsible or hold myself liable\" sort of thing.\n\nIt's one of those things that are hard to judge in a small snippet of texts. However, I tonally read it as a complete lack of care, however others might not.", "If they don't have a therapy plan in place then neither of you are the AH and they probably shouldn't have been forced to go outside to somewhere that would trigger their OCD. I just assumed that this was part of them becoming more comfortable with going outdoors and accepting that things happen. (Baby steps sort of thing). However, if they're not being seen by a specialist, I feel bad for all of you, really. Y'all aren't qualified, Lee is sick, Dani is probably terrified and you're being held liable and I'm assuming they didn't advise you on what to do and just argued? Yeah I change my mind, NTA, my apologies.", "Oh no need to apologize. Your thoughts are as valuable as anyone else's. But literally we walked in the door and they were still going on about how little effort it would have taken him to text or call her back. This was after they ranted on the phone to him for 10 minutes. Lee deals with it by ignoring them but I felt the need to be like, \"Excuse me? Are you even worried about him?\" Then eventually suggested if that's how it was going to be he can bunk at my place if he wanted, and again, their focus was that it wouldn't be good for Dani because she'd be worried about him while he's away.\n\nA very frustrating situation for all.", "I honestly wish you and Lee the best, it isn't fair you're both being thrown under a bus in favour of Dani's OCD. Ironically, this isn't even helping their OCD (clearly) so whoever's plan this was needs a bollocking really. \n\nMy heart goes out to all of you and I hope it doesn't ruin any relationships in the long term. You're a real homie.", "NTA. Lee's mom is the AH. She did that thing that neurotypical people often do, assuming that they know better and can force their loved ones into \"getting better\" by pushing them into things.\n\nUnfortunately, desensitization doesn't work like that. In order for desensitization to be effective, you need to go into it feeling calm and secure, and it needs to be relatively low-stakes. You need to have the tools required to calm down and remain secure throughout the process. Driving her seriously ill stepbrother to and from the hospital was NEVER going to help Dani *at all,* because it's just too much of an emotionally fraught situation-- there's no way to start from a calm and secure baseline when the task involves the severe illness of a close family member. \n\nThe big problem with these inept attempts at desensitization is that they invariably make things *worse* by increasing feelings of anxiety and trauma, rather than breaking through that anxiety and increasing feelings of security. \n\nSo not only was it ridiculous to think that Lee should be the guinea pig for Dani's mental health, but it's hurtful to Dani herself, too. \n\nIt's better for *both* Lee and Dani for Lee to be living somewhere else during such a stressful time. Environmental factors are huge in OCD. Dani's contamination fears will inevitably skyrocket, and she obviously doesn't have the tools and effective support (cough cough meddling mother cough cough) needed to handle them-- which means her symptoms will get worse, making things more stressful for Lee, and EVERYONE will be miserable. \n\n(Incidentally, the word you're looking for for difficulty leaving the house is probably agoraphobia.)", "NTA, it is not your friend's responsibility to care for his struggling sister while he is undergoing chemo. He should not be worrying about anything except his own recovery. You're awesome for making yourself and your home available to him during this difficult time. The sister needs to have her own treatment plan that doesn't hinge on her physically ill relative bending over backwards to reassure her (which by the way doesn't actually help OCD anyway - it sounds like she was compulsively checking on him, which is a symptom of her illness that she needs help managing). Hope he makes a full recovery.", "You're a good friend, and I suspect you'll be an excellent nurse.  Compassionate and assertive!\n\nNTA", "nta\n\nI hope Lee gets better and doesn't have to spend time with these emotional vampires.", "NTA keep your friend safe from those psychos. Tell him to block them for a while. They need a time out and he doesn't need the stress", "I would also argue that even if Lee DIDN'T have cancer, being required to respond to 40 texts in under 4 hours is insane. I don't have time to answer that many texts. So Dani and stepmom REALLY need to deal with Dani's OCD because it is not acceptable to expect everyone to respond simply because Dani needs them to...", "Yeah, desensitization through taking on tasks that increase anxiety needs to be done in a way where you can feel calm and secure to start out, and have all the tools needed to return to calm and security as much as possible throughout the attempt. The *severe illness of a close family member* cannot possibly provide that kind of context.", "Yeah realised was the mother's plan. I'm sorry for your loss. It's a really difficult situation because while I fully agree with you that people should prioritise their own health, especially with chemo, it doesn't make other people's conditions disappear. They happen simultaneously and often conflict and cause chaos for lack of a better term. But it's nobodies fault? Just 2 events happening at once that neither can control.\n\nI wished the stepmother was more responsible, however, I thought OP had a more active role with Dani, turns out not so, was all the step mother. It's just unfortunate especially since the mother seems to have preferential treatment with Dani. \n\nI hope you're doing alright as with OP and Lee.", "Exactly even a non medical professional like myself can understand that acclimation is a slow, gradual process. When someone tries that controlled exposure to allergens, it's done in a safe environment **under supervision of medical professionals**, and given controlled micro doses.\n\nThere's nothing gradual or controlled with Dani taking him, particularly with the \"puh-lease text meee **this isn't helping my OCD**\" plea.", "Yes...? My issue is how the person who I'm replying to worded their point lmao? I do think she's in the wrong", "Been a few years in the rear-view mirror, honestly.  Getting through the shiva--thank Yahweh for Chinese food and bourbon--was the hardest part.  I'm actually in a far better headspace these days due to job change and reconnecting with some family during the pandemic.  \n\nFunny thing it, my dad had OCD himself that was later managed with SSRI's.  So I get both sides.", "I'm \"yes, and\"-ing your point. \ud83d\ude09", "Because my brother has OCD and I'm sick of people treating people like crap (Not OP) because of their OCD. I didn't mean any offence to people with OCD, but it is a touchy subject for me being a carer for someone with OCD. \n\nIs it wrong for me to speak about it?", "OH my mistake"]}
