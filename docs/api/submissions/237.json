NTA.  \n\nYour family will always judge you for not going but honestly they aren\u2019t worth giving a shit about either it seems like.  And if you do go visit, you\u2019re likely subject to another berating anyway.  \n\nIf it\u2019s worth it to you to suck it up for an hour and go just to shut up the rest of the family then do it, otherwise no.", "NTA. Some people only hold hate just because you don't follow what they want. You don't need to feed them attention, it sucks even though he was your grandpa, he made that call by exiling you out of his life.", "NTA - family is a lottery, you get what you get. I'll never understand the \"it's family\" argument. You owe them nothing. Stay away, move on and be happy. If one day they want to apologise to you, then great.", "He cares more about what others think than his relationship with you. NTA. Go live a good & happy life without them.", "NTA- As someone who grew up with religion, I know how difficult it is to challenge family values. You have no attachment, and therefore you have no obligation. Why have a heart for someone so heartless to you?", "NTA I mean if he feels that way about you why would he even want ti see you?", "NTA. You lost him a while ago. No reason to relive that.", "You are NTA. This is why I really dislike organised religion. You sound like you have a good handle on your own needs. I'd hold the line, and don't worry about people calling you heartless; they are clearly either too religious, or too enmeshed, to appreciate your legitimate point of view."]}
