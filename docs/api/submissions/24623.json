My bio mom has been out of my life since I was a baby because she wasn't a good mom. My stepmom was a widow who had four kids. Three girls ages 6, 7 and 8 and a son who was 10. My stepsiblings were SO close growing up. They were BFFs and siblings and never had any problem hanging out with each other. I was not welcome to be part of that. They were never outright cruel to me, they didn't bully me, but they didn't want me to be part of their sibling group either. My stepmom and dad tried to make us one big nuclear family unit over the years. They went out of their way to try and create that but my stepsiblings, for their own reasons, never wanted that and never accepted me as part of their family. I was only included when it would be mean not to and it was never the same with me. More often than not they just didn't hang out with me though. As a little girl it was hard. I went through a bad patch when I was 9 and my bio mom was trying to see me and I had to talk to a social worker and someone in the courts and I felt so alone. My stepmom tried to encourage my stepsiblings to be there for me a little more. I heard her one night ask them if they would invite me to play or to do something with them. They never did it and seemed pretty reluctant from what I heard.\n\nAs we all got older they remained close and I was on the outside still. But as I closed in on my 20s I reached the point of acceptance, with the help of a therapist.\n\nI am now engaged to a wonderful man and we're planning our wedding. I asked my future SIL to be my bridesmaid because she and I have become best friends since meeting but she's also like the sister I desperately wanted as a kid but never had.\n\nI do have my stepsiblings on the guest list for my wedding. But as regular guests and I'm not even expecting them to show up if I'm honest, hopefully they at least RSVP. This came up with my dad and stepmom and my stepmom's family and stepmom and her family were upset that I was not planning to give my stepsiblings a role in the wedding. They were like at the very least the girls should be my bridesmaids. I pointed out we are not close and bridesmaids are supposed to be the people you are closest to. They said we're family all the same and family normally have roles in weddings. My dad was mostly silent but pointed out if roles were reversed and one of them was getting married, they might not even think to invite me. Stepmom's mom said they would be having the same conversation with them. And neither side excluding the other makes it right.\n\nI told them I did not think I could give in to their request. They did not take that well and told me I would be in the wrong not to.\n\nWIBTA if I don't give my stepsiblings a role?", "created_utc": 1692014791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qsukv/wibta_if_i_dont_give_my_stepsiblings_roles_in_my/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wedding is about having the people closest to you, the people who'd have your back through thick and thin, by your side. The last thing you'd want at your wedding and during your wedding festivities, is to have a group within your bridal party trying, again, to make you feel like an outsider, which is exactly how their presence will likely make you feel. You deserve more than that. No need to concern yourself with how your family feels. Worry about how YOU feel. It's your day.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd sadly, families get very entitled during weddings and they like to pretend closeness that doesn\u2019t exist. Weddings make family dynamics very visible and after years of you being left out, this is a very concrete proof that you did not grow up to be close with your step siblings and everyone will see.\n\nIt will be hard to be firm with your step mother and keep your step siblings out of the wedding, but it will also be hard to enjoy with your step siblings there. Don\u2019t change your mind and keep them out of the wedding.", "The only people who should be in the bridal party are those who are close and special to the bride and groom. \n\nIt's your wedding, your choice. \n\nYou've invited them and that is enough for people you aren't particularly close to\n\nNTA", "Yes, and dad send clued in on it with the 'they might not even think to invite her' to a step wedding comment.

Nobody can say I didn't at least send the invite. We're not expecting to hear back anyway.", "NTA. Youre bridesmade should be someone who will care to support you.", "NTA and I wouldn't even bother inviting them honestly. It sounds like they wouldn't even want to be in your wedding and your stepmother and her mom are getting upset for nothing.", "NTA. You are not close and they excluded you most of their lives. Why would they want to be in the wedding? Make your choice and tell them stepmom stop butt out.", "NTA. Your dad said it all\u2014if the roles were reversed, you may not even be *invited,* let alone *in* the wedding. \n\nstep mom is living in a fantasy land thinking that her children would want to be included, or even show up for that matter. Her insisting you include them is honestly cruel as she is obviously well aware of what you endured throughout your childhood when it came to your step siblings. Yes, she tried to get them to include you, but it was unsuccessful. It is not your responsibility to continue this delusion into adulthood that they care about you or want to be involved in your life. \n\nIt is so selfless and mature of you to even send them and invitation after all they\u2019ve put you through. Good for you. I wish you the best on your wedding day!", "Wait a minute I have read this story here before.", "They didn't try so why should you do as you please on your special day if they don't like it tough", "NTA even if you had offered them roles in the wedding it\u2019s likely they\u2019d have declined. Bring invited as guests is already generous if you.", "NTA. You owe them and step mom and the rest of stepmoms family nothing.", "NTA Your stepmom and her family are wrong. You're not family all the same. you are an outsider to your stepsiblings' little family unit. No reason to include them in the wedding party. Congratulations on your wedding; wishing you a lifetime of happiness.", "Nta. They don\u2019t care so why should you?", "NTA. \n\nYour stepmom and her family need to consider all the years of hurt that your stepsiblings exclusion caused you. While it may be true that if they'd excluded you from their weddings, your stepmom and her family might have spoken with them, it wouldn't do anything to change their decision--as they well know it.\n\nNow that you've come to a place of peace and acceptance about their right to choose not to have you in their lives, your stepmom wants you to disturb that peace? And how does she even know that her children would even accept a position in your wedding without turning you down. Remember, these are the same people who wouldn't even deign to play with you growing up with them every damn day.\n\nI think you need to have a conversation with your father and ask him to reign in his wife and her relatives. He knows how you were excluded and that it took you a long time to accept the fact that you aren't family to them. They shouldn't bring this up to you again.", "NTA. You deserve to have people who support you and you can rely on in your wedding party.\n\nI also generally don\u2019t get the obsession with family needing to be in the wedding party. I\u2019m close to my siblings and none of them were in mine. None of them expected to be either.", "You should have the ones you are closest to in the Bridal Party.  I am actually shocked they thought they deserved any role in the wedding.\n\nAn invitation to the wedding is more than gracious.\n\nNTA", "NTA, honestly they probably don't even want to be in your wedding. You should point out that the only people who want this is your stepmom and her family. \n\nDo you and your steps inline have the mutual understanding at this point that you're just associated because of your parents' marriage? Like y'all are polite and chitchat but you're never gonna be best of friends? If you do, you could probably just tell them your step mom is insisting they be part of the wedding party and you hope they understand that you're choosing other people as you aren't very close. \n\nIt kinda throws their mom under the bus but also makes it clear that you're shutting down the option so both parties aren't guilted into by your stepmom. That way they don't feel awkward around you if your step mom lies about you wanting them to be in the wedding.", "YWNBTA\n\nYour wedding is what it is: YOUR wedding. Don't let anybody pressure you into doing something that you don't want. This day is about you and your husband. Not about them.", "NTA. The steps have no interest in you or your life. And your Dad is right, they would not invite you to be in the wedding party, and maybe not even to the wedding. SM wants to show the world that you are all a happy family. It's your wedding. You choose your bridesmaids. Congrats!!", "NTA. Family participation in a wedding should be up to the couple, especially for the attendant roles.\n\nBeen to and in a dozen or so weddings, and the number where siblings were involved that way has been heavily outweighed by the ones where they weren't. Don't let step-mom snowjob you that \"family participation is normal\". It may be typical of weddings that she's experienced. But little to no family participation is just as normal.\n\nDo the step siblings even care about their lack of involvement? Between your expectation that they won't attend, and your dad's comment about role reversal, I doubt it. They may not even know that their mom and grandma are kicking up this fuss.\n\nThis may be something that can be worked to your mutual advantage. If they don't care, and wouldn't want to be in your wedding, this can be leveraged.\n\nTalk to your dad about him letting them know whats going on. Get him to rally them to do their part in shutting mom down too. Its as much in their interest to do so now, rather then having to completely rehash this same subject every time one of them gets married too.\n\nYes, your stepmom may be very hurt to finally accept that there is no relationship between you and her kids. But the longer she continues not accepting it, the more likely it is that she will do damage to her relationships with you and/or her kids.\n\nWeddings are just the tip of the iceberg for the trouble that could be caused, if she continues to push this theme.", "I find the 5 year rule useful. If you did not have any contact in the last 5 years (Mail, phone, social media, personal), you don't have a relationship. No invitation needed (unless you want to rekindle the relationship).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf neither of you cared enough to reach out in the last five years, not inviting them is fine even when you have an extremely large wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(For small weddings, many more will not get an invite)."]}
