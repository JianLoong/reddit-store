My bio mom has been out of my life since I was a baby because she wasn't a good mom. My stepmom was a widow who had four kids. Three girls ages 6, 7 and 8 and a son who was 10. My stepsiblings were SO close growing up. They were BFFs and siblings and never had any problem hanging out with each other. I was not welcome to be part of that. They were never outright cruel to me, they didn't bully me, but they didn't want me to be part of their sibling group either. My stepmom and dad tried to make us one big nuclear family unit over the years. They went out of their way to try and create that but my stepsiblings, for their own reasons, never wanted that and never accepted me as part of their family. I was only included when it would be mean not to and it was never the same with me. More often than not they just didn't hang out with me though. As a little girl it was hard. I went through a bad patch when I was 9 and my bio mom was trying to see me and I had to talk to a social worker and someone in the courts and I felt so alone. My stepmom tried to encourage my stepsiblings to be there for me a little more. I heard her one night ask them if they would invite me to play or to do something with them. They never did it and seemed pretty reluctant from what I heard.\n\nAs we all got older they remained close and I was on the outside still. But as I closed in on my 20s I reached the point of acceptance, with the help of a therapist.\n\nI am now engaged to a wonderful man and we're planning our wedding. I asked my future SIL to be my bridesmaid because she and I have become best friends since meeting but she's also like the sister I desperately wanted as a kid but never had.\n\nI do have my stepsiblings on the guest list for my wedding. But as regular guests and I'm not even expecting them to show up if I'm honest, hopefully they at least RSVP. This came up with my dad and stepmom and my stepmom's family and stepmom and her family were upset that I was not planning to give my stepsiblings a role in the wedding. They were like at the very least the girls should be my bridesmaids. I pointed out we are not close and bridesmaids are supposed to be the people you are closest to. They said we're family all the same and family normally have roles in weddings. My dad was mostly silent but pointed out if roles were reversed and one of them was getting married, they might not even think to invite me. Stepmom's mom said they would be having the same conversation with them. And neither side excluding the other makes it right.\n\nI told them I did not think I could give in to their request. They did not take that well and told me I would be in the wrong not to.\n\nWIBTA if I don't give my stepsiblings a role?", "created_utc": 1692014791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qsukv/wibta_if_i_dont_give_my_stepsiblings_roles_in_my/", "score": 258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not your responsibility to continue this delusion into adulthood that they care about you or want to be involved in your life. \n\nIt is so selfless and mature of you to even send them and invitation after all they\u2019ve put you through.

Family participation in a wedding should be up to the couple, especially for the attendant roles.\n\nBeen to and in a dozen or so weddings, and the number where siblings were involved that way has been heavily outweighed by the ones where they weren't.

If they don't care, and wouldn't want to be in your wedding, this can be leveraged.\n\nTalk to your dad about him letting them know whats going on.

You don't carry the onus of making these relationships work, and you never will.

I feel guilty inviting them, knowing we might have trouble with missing RSVPs and it costing us when my fiance would be supportive of not inviting them.", "Get your stepmum to chase them up. However, a missing rsvp always means no place at the reception. Remind stepmum of that. \n\nShe might say that they would have come if they were in the wedding party but it's almost worth trying a bait and switch and inviting the steps  to be attendants and them refusing.  It will cause an almighty row.beteeen mum and her kids.", "Certainly not. You were being nice just to invite them. Why would you want people standing up with you who never went out of their way to even have a relationship with you? Your stepmother is being very unreasonable.", "NTA.  Your wedding, your roles to fill as you see fit.  The bridal party is supposed to be close to the bride, and sometimes that is not blood or family related.  If your stepmom and all want to keep harping, go ahead and call up the stepsiblings right into the conversation to give their honest input.  They probably do not want the roles or even the offer of it.  \n\nIt's your wedding so do as you wish with it and the rest of the family can deal with it or RSVP no and save you money and headache.", "NTA\n\n>I pointed out we are not close and bridesmaids are supposed to be the people you are closest to. They said we're family all the same and family normally have roles in weddings.\n\nYes, because often times family *are* the people you are closest to. You and your stepsiblings might as well be strangers at that point! So stepmom and family need to stay out of it.\n\nBut figure out what you're going to do if your stepsiblings *do* show up. Are you interested in getting to know them as adults, or is it too little and too late for you at this point?", "I have 6 half siblings, all older than me (my family is kind of like if the Brady Bunch had a 7th kid) after they blended it.  I get along fine with all my siblings but we're not super close.  All of them are married, two of them more than once. I've never had a role in one of their weddings because, guess what, we aren't that close.  Your wedding is yours, do what you want with it.", "Nta.  Your wedding your choices", "Not sure give speeches should be in this list- what would they say?!", "Your fiance is a darling! Just the right one for you!!!!\nHe has your back and truly sees and understands the situation", "You don\u2019t have to invite them but I agree it would probably be easier to do so just to keep the peace. It is ultimately your call though. NTA and congrats!", "I had a small garden wedding, about 50 guests. My father participated in my wedding, but my older brother, younger brother, and sister did not. I had a maid of honor, my husband had a best man, that was it! No need to include people that don\u2019t even act like they like you. You were being generous just inviting them. NTA!", "NTA\n\nYou are inviting them to your wedding. Kudos for this after all that!!! You are not excluding anyone.\n\nYou are giving special roles to people close to you, and these are not your stepsiblings. \n\nYour stepsiblings are not close to you, and they know that. They worked on this for a long time. Your father pointed out this distance in the discusions. Sometimes step-families just don't work out.\n\nStepmother's family will just have to deal.\n\nThis is your wedding. You get to decide.", ">This came up with my dad and stepmom and my stepmom's family and stepmom and her family were upset that I was not planning to give my stepsiblings a role in the wedding. They were like at the very least the girls should be my bridesmaids.\n\nNo. Just no. You are not a doll your stepmom can dress up to force to play with her kids. NTA.", "Tip for Missing RSVPs, set a final deadline for yourself. Before that day any missing RSVPS get an email/text/carrier pigeon stating that if you don\u2019t hear from them by that date, you will assume they can\u2019t make it. \n\nAnyone reaches out after the date, sadly the venue cannot accommodate any changes.", "  NTA send the invite. Enjoy your day it\u2019s not about them and your father clearly has seen the exclusion of you over the years. It is what it is for all parties and if your step mom\u2019s family doesn\u2019t stay out of it they probably never considered you part of the family. They either want to attend because they care about you and want to celebrate and stay out of issues they should not be involved in. If your step siblings choose not to attend just basic etiquette they should RSVP. If they don\u2019t they are TA. And will affirm your feelings that you had growing up.", "NTA. You we thoughtful enough to invite them . You could have been petty and ignored them. You are not mean by not including them . Stepmom need to back off .", "Their all grown adults if they don\u2019t have the basic manners and decency to at least RSVP no it says a lot about them"]}
