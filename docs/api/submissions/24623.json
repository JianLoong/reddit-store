My bio mom has been out of my life since I was a baby because she wasn't a good mom. My stepmom was a widow who had four kids. Three girls ages 6, 7 and 8 and a son who was 10. My stepsiblings were SO close growing up. They were BFFs and siblings and never had any problem hanging out with each other. I was not welcome to be part of that. They were never outright cruel to me, they didn't bully me, but they didn't want me to be part of their sibling group either. My stepmom and dad tried to make us one big nuclear family unit over the years. They went out of their way to try and create that but my stepsiblings, for their own reasons, never wanted that and never accepted me as part of their family. I was only included when it would be mean not to and it was never the same with me. More often than not they just didn't hang out with me though. As a little girl it was hard. I went through a bad patch when I was 9 and my bio mom was trying to see me and I had to talk to a social worker and someone in the courts and I felt so alone. My stepmom tried to encourage my stepsiblings to be there for me a little more. I heard her one night ask them if they would invite me to play or to do something with them. They never did it and seemed pretty reluctant from what I heard.\n\nAs we all got older they remained close and I was on the outside still. But as I closed in on my 20s I reached the point of acceptance, with the help of a therapist.\n\nI am now engaged to a wonderful man and we're planning our wedding. I asked my future SIL to be my bridesmaid because she and I have become best friends since meeting but she's also like the sister I desperately wanted as a kid but never had.\n\nI do have my stepsiblings on the guest list for my wedding. But as regular guests and I'm not even expecting them to show up if I'm honest, hopefully they at least RSVP. This came up with my dad and stepmom and my stepmom's family and stepmom and her family were upset that I was not planning to give my stepsiblings a role in the wedding. They were like at the very least the girls should be my bridesmaids. I pointed out we are not close and bridesmaids are supposed to be the people you are closest to. They said we're family all the same and family normally have roles in weddings. My dad was mostly silent but pointed out if roles were reversed and one of them was getting married, they might not even think to invite me. Stepmom's mom said they would be having the same conversation with them. And neither side excluding the other makes it right.\n\nI told them I did not think I could give in to their request. They did not take that well and told me I would be in the wrong not to.\n\nWIBTA if I don't give my stepsiblings a role?", "created_utc": 1692014791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qsukv/wibta_if_i_dont_give_my_stepsiblings_roles_in_my/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This has upset my stepmom and her family. They want me to include them and feel like either me or them not including the other in the wedding is a big deal because we're technically family. I refused to do this and I might be the asshole because I know feelings are going to be hurt and people would be offended and I could ask and let them say no and at least I tried. I'm not doing so because I gave up on the idea of change happening between us.

Your wedding is about having the people closest to you, the people who'd have your back through thick and thin, by your side. The last thing you'd want at your wedding and during your wedding festivities, is to have a group within your bridal party trying, again, to make you feel like an outsider, which is exactly how their presence will likely make you feel.
