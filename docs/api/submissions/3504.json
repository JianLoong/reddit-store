She would constantly argue with him in my Instagram comments and it would get so bad I had to delete the entire post. We would have an argument every day about how she hates him and would always hang over my head about how I am choosing him over her when I told her to knock it off for arguing on Instagram. I was confused as to why she hated him so much so I asked and it was because she had a dream about how if I dated him, her and I would stop being as close. I felt bad so then I just gave in and called things off with him because she would throw a tantrum to the both of us. Right after, she dated a guy and she stopped talking to me often.\n\nSo a bit goes by and him and I talk again and we have been dating! He is the absolute sweetest and most patient person ever, I love him so much. He never treated me wrong. For slight context, I was in an extremely abusive relationship before him. Everyone including my family loved my ex and always defended him. My current relationship has been the sweetest and most loved I\u2019ve ever felt, which is why I get defensive when she bad mouths my boyfriend. \n\nShe apologized to him and we all hang out too. Then, her and her boyfriend broke up and she\u2019s back to hating my boyfriend. She would constantly say vile things about him and I don\u2019t know how to react to them. It was like walking on eggshells. So I started to drift away from her as the hostility was getting too much for me to handle. \n\nThen, she asks me why I haven\u2019t been talkative to her. I explain why, saying she makes me uncomfortable talking about someone who has done no wrong to me at all in a foul way and that she\u2019s my only social interaction since I do not have any other friends and my relationship with my family isn\u2019t good either (due to my ex\u2026 more context needed but you get the point for now). She blows up on me saying I\u2019m selfish for choosing him over her and that I should value my friends. We stop talking for a few days and she apologizes and says she feels bad. We make up and she goes back to always talking about him. Then the cycle of her dating someone and suddenly being fine with him comes again. There\u2019s more little stories but these are the main ones. \n\nI can\u2019t tell if I really am being selfish for choosing him over her and there\u2019s a point I\u2019m not seeing.", "created_utc": 1669723028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7s103/aita_for_choosing_my_boyfriend_over_my_friend/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your \u201cfriend\u201d engages in classic abusive behavior.  She accuses you of doing something shitty because it\u2019s exactly what she does in the same situation. She obviously has all kinds of issues, and it sounds like you would be much better off ending this one-sided friendship.", "NTA the point you are missing is that you are in an abusive relationship with your friend. They do not want you to be happy and actively sabotage your happiness.\n\nI am wondering if it will be easier for you to make more friends if you ditch this toxic person.", "NTA. What you're not seeing is that she's not your friend. When she has her own boyfriend, she's content and too busy to work on ruining your relationship. When she's single, she's doing her best to destroy your relationship so that you're single too. She doesn't like sharing you, and doesn't want you to be close to anyone except her. She is selfish and toxic. She is not friend material. That she cannot stop bad mouthing your boyfriend even though you have expressed your dislike of her behavior - says that she has NO respect for your feelings on the matter: only her feelings count. She will continue to walk all over you because you keep letting her back in: No more second chances, she isn't going to change.", "NTA, she's out of line, trying to control your life.", "You left an abusive ex, but kept the abusive \u2018friend\u2019. Dump her, and be happy with your boyfriend.\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour \"friend\" clearly isn\u2018t your friend!", "NTA I would high key recommend you stay away from her. She doesn\u2019t sound like any sort of \u201cfriend\u201d you need in your life.", "NTA, and she is not a real friend. Making someone else feel like shit just because you\u2019re single is low and also wildly irresponsible if you are a victim of abuse.", "NTA your friend is miserable... And misery loves company. She's that friend that hates that you're in a good relationship, and she'll try to get you to either break up with him, or cheat on him", "NTA. Sounds like she feels the need to make you single if she is single which is childish and probably means she needs therapy", "OP this is not what friendship looks like. Just like a boyfriend shouldn't mistreat you, a real friend will never try to take away your happiness. NTA and please continue cutting back your time with this person.", "NTA. Your 'friend' is clearly jealous, and is trying to gaslight you.", "NTA. She's one of those people who can't accept other people having something unless she has it too. She's toxic. I know it'll be lonely, but lose her.", "NTA. She sounds very controlling, trying to manipulate you to break up with your bf bc she wants more of your attention", "She got her reasoning from a dream and then became a self fulfilling prophecy. Why don't you talk to her about that?", "She's jealous ignore her, tell her if she can not respect and be civil to your boyfriend you will cut ties with her and block her", ">I felt bad so then I just gave in and called things off with him because she would throw a tantrum to the both of us. \n\nNTA for finally distancing yourself from this controlling \"friend\". YTA for dumping a wonderful guy to appease this \"friend\". To be honest I'm surprised he decided to go out with you again.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nYou need to cut her out and block her on everything. She's not your friend, she only keeps you around to control and abuse you. I bet she's the reason you don't have many other friends too.", "NTA and your so-called friend is both toxic and selfish to an alarming degree. Even if things don't work out with (what sounds like) your delightful current bf, go NC with that so-called friend anyway now.\n\nIf you have limited friends and are frightened to cut her off for that reason, don't be scared. You're still young and it is possible to make new friends right through your life, though admittedly it gets harder as you get older. Better a few real friends than a ton of supposed friends who will ghost you or who really aren't interested. Get involved in things that really interest ***you*** \\- maybe theatre groups, sports group e.g. yoga or martial arts, arts classes. You'll find a few people to be real friends with.", "NTA, sounds like she\u2019s jealous that you\u2019re not single when she is. \n\nThis is really toxic and controlling behavior. She wants you to break up with your boyfriend, not because of anything he\u2019s done, but because of a dream she had? That doesn\u2019t justify hating someone. She\u2019s the one causing distance in the friendship by bad mouthing your boyfriend for no reason. And to top it off, she basically ditches  you once she\u2019s in a relationship. Which is what *she* was worried about you doing. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to not have many friends, but it\u2019s better for your own sanity and peace to cut people like that out of your life.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think more context is needed in terms of your ex. Abusers pick people very carefully, including the ones surrounding the relationship like family and friends. Their goal is to gain the trust of others so that you\u2019ll have no one else to turn to. I\u2019m proud of you for getting out of that relationship, and I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re doing better. I hope one day your family comes around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or, so it seems. She has control issues. You can always do online friendships to start or Tinder search for friends (if you\u2019re old enough). I haven\u2019t had one friend for the past 6 years and I don\u2019t miss it, but then again I don\u2019t like people\u2026 Anyways, if you can and if you\u2019re comfortable, the online route could be the way to go. And, I wholeheartedly agree with you distancing yourself. She\u2019s a whole **BIOHAZARD**", "NTA: If she can't have or doesn't have a boy friend then why should you seems to be her attitude from what I can see. You just might actually have to choose between them because walking that fine line is going to just get harder and harder.", "Friendships are relationships too and this one also seems abusive and toxic. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nShe is the one pushing you away, instead of you in that dream of hers. \n\nYou are also not selfish for choosing the person that treats you right over someone who makes you uncomfortable and is extremely rude to your bf. She's TA, not you.", "NTA your friend has a problem with you being in a healthy relationship while she isn't. Hard to tell, but maybe that's because she either wants to compete with you or your boyfriend. But besides that, you shouldn't care too much about what she says. It's not even her opinion hence why she has a change of heart as soon as she has a new bf. \nSee your boyfriend more as a metaphor for relationships when talking to her, because that's what she does. I can imagine that the things she 'hates' about your bf are either far or picky-close from detailed.", "You're not the asshole here.\n\nRepeat this to yourself every day.\n\nYou are not the asshole here.\n\nYour friend is not your friend.", "NTA she's a control freak.

She is treating your bf bad because there is a chance that you\u2019re relationship with him will push her away. Instead her actions are what is causing you to push her away. It also seems that she doesn\u2019t want you in a happy relationship unless she is in one too. She has no issue with your bf as long as she has a bf. This friend is toxic and you don\u2019t need that in your life. You need to branch out and make other friends that are more supportive.", "NTA - Sorry but she is the one that is ruining your relationship with her. There are people out there that want the people they are close with to sit in the same misery they do so it can be then verse the world. And that is what your friend sounds like. She is the one making you choose, not him. So sorry home slice.... the boy toy it is.", "I would point out to her that she is not being a good friend to you by disrespecting you and your healthy relationship and that if she continues acting like this her behavior will be the reason you cut her out of your life for being disrespectful to him and by extension to you and it will be her own jealous fault.\n\nNTA\n\nShe is the selfish one. She should be happy you are not being abused and welcome him with open arms. \n\nYou have a right to a healthy relationship with a wonderful guy who loves you. Those are rare now a days.

She is the one with major toxic behavior here.", "I tried to when we had the argument\u2026 I didn\u2019t reply to her so she texted one of my family members to get me to reply and saying stuff about my boyfriend to make him look bad\u2026 :\u2019)", "This, what I thought first is that this 'friend' is not much better than the abusive ex, this is some really toxic behavior, and I'm sorry for OP that she feels it's somehow her fault that this friend is absolute trash", "would you mind explaining the gaslighting? i\u2019m not very smart and can\u2019t see it\u2026", "If you are talking about her doing it to me, I did and she blew up on me and said he would gaslight her into not replying to me.

I\u2019m worried about her contacting my family again (I replied in another comment but when we had the argument and I didn\u2019t reply to her she messaged my family to get me to respond and tried to make my boyfriend look like a bad guy) or doing something extremely petty like that, she\u2019s been known to do that after someone cuts her off", "You need to write a letter to all friends and family.

She\u2019s using you to fill her time at the expense of your own life happiness.", "Sort of like when someone is lying to you, confusing you, making you doubt yourself. I'm not sure if that's right, but it's what I think it to mean. Perhaps someone else could explain it better. :)", "Sounds like you lost a friend from her own doing. What do you think?", "Sorry, she obviously is a very manipulative person. Don't think she was ever really your friend. She sounds like someone you should avoid in the future. Good luck with your relationship, hope he's the one for you."]}
