Wife stays with baby full time.\n\nSo, my wife\u2019s been obsessed with getting a new buggy/stroller for the baby for a few days now. She found one she wanted yesterday and ordered it instantly with next day delivery. All good so far.\n\nToday comes around, I\u2019m at work and she\u2019s taking baby for their weekly baby activity. She gets a delivery update that her new order is being delivered between 1-2pm. This is the same time baby activity is also. She calls me in a panic saying she really wants the buggy/stroller before the weekend so we can\u2019t miss the delivery but she also doesn\u2019t want to miss the baby activity today. \n\nAfter a back and forth, she requested that I go home during my lunch break and see if I catch the delivery in time. I reluctantly agree. She says she\u2019ll bring me a sandwich for my efforts. I go home, get the delivery, go straight back to work. She thanks me and tells me she\u2019ll put the sandwich in the fridge for me.\n\nNOW IT GETS JUICY! I get home from work, I\u2019m hungry, tired, stressed, you name it. The only thing keeping me going is the thought of that chicken and bacon sandwich waiting for me. I open the fridge to find no sandwich. Hmmm. I look around - nothing. My wife walks in and I ask her, \u201cwhere\u2019s my sandwich?\u201d. She tells me she got hungry and ate it. Not even an ounce of regret or anything. I lose it and say that it\u2019s not fair how she expected me to do everything I did for her today and the one thing she did in return from me - SHE ATE. She got upset about my reaction and said it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, and that I can just make myself something else to eat. I just walk off and sit by myself for a while. \n\nAITA for reacting the way I did?\n\nEdit: Baby activity could have been rescheduled to the next day. \u201cLosing it\u201d is a bit exaggerated, I was quite annoyed with her is more accurate.

She just wanted a new nicer one.\n\nEdit 3: the sandwich isn\u2019t the point here, I would have done this for nothing in return. It\u2019s more the principal that I was promised something as a reward for sacrificing my only work break to help her.\n\nEdit 4: this was a deli chicken bacon and Mayo sub. From a small store, not homemade.\n\nEdit 5: my wife is not a bad or horrible person. This doesn\u2019t reflect her morals or how she is as a person/wife/mother.

You missed lunch because you were doing her a favor (neither she nor the baby NEEDED the stroller today - it could have waited; she just WANTED it today; alternately, the baby would have zero idea if they missed one activity nor would it have any impact on their life), and she promised you the sandwich to make up for the lunch you didn't get then she turns around and eats the sandwich AFTER she got what she wanted from you. \n\nPersonally, my petty ass would go out right now, pick up her favorite take-out for just you, then take it home and eat in front of her.", "NTA! That was really inconsiderate of her. If there was other food in the house, she should have eaten that.", "NTA. Promises were broken and reaction was precedented.", "NTA, dude she promised you a delicious sandwich, you thought about it all day, then she said she ate it and to make yourself something to eat. It was just a dick move on her end she could've had a different snack than the one item you were promised.", "NTA.\n\nNeither of you were home, so you both had to compromise. She didn't hold up her end of the compromise. You're not an asshole for just being disappointed for not getting something that was promised to you.", "NTA but I might be partial cuz I fucking hate it when people eat someone else's food without asking. It doesn't even have to be like which honestly makes it much worse. You don't give someone something then just take it back for yourself later and not say a word. Hella rude. I'd be pissed off too.", "NTA I don't think the main problem here is the sandwich.   \nIt's that your wife ate something that she promised to you.", "I\u2019m definitely getting Ross Gellar vibes \n\nAnd NTA", "You ate MY sandwich!?!! MY. SANDWICH???!!!", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't be skipping lunch for them anymore. What she did was rude and inconsiderate.", "NTA- not at all. Very inconsiderate of her, to say the least.", "NTA, I think I\u2019d be most annoyed at her reaction. I feel like if she was apologetic it would be one thing, but she doesn\u2019t sound it at all.", "She absolutely did not need to go to some nonsense baby activity that required you to accommodate her on your lunch break. She ate your sandwich and didn't even think to replace it. Bit self centred but I wouldn't get hung up about it.", "NGL that kinda seems like an AH move on her part unless you had nothing else to eat in the house.  Sorry.", "NTA. I felt that.", "NTA she was rude", " NTA she shouldn\u2019t have said she\u2019d get it for you if she was going to eat it. She should have offered to go get another.", "NTA. It'd be one thing if she hadn't made it and had forgotten, but she made the sandwich and then ate it herself? That shows a pretty glaringly obvious lack of respect for anything you contribute at her request. \n\nIt's not about the ~~greek yoghurt~~ sandwich. It's about she could have found her own alternative, dragged you into it on your lunch break, then intentionally screwed you out of it. Then blamed you for having feelings about it. That's a dick move, buddy.\n\nMight want to consider suggesting therapy. Something else is going on here and this is just her being passive aggressive with it.", "I'd be pissed! If it's a one off thing, I'd let it go. If this is a usual thing it needs to be addressed.", "In the words of Ross Gellar, MY SANDWICH?!\n\nBut fr NTA. She was pretty carelessly selfish here. Does she often ask you to bend over backwards for her and then underdeliver on her end of the deal?", "Nta at all ..... im pregnan5 myself and would never do this", "NTA. \n\nI would\u2019ve DoorDashed myself an entire gourmet meal and ate it in front of her. Dramatically.", "NTA. Probably could have handled it better, but NTA.", "Nta", "Info: what kind of sandwich was it?", "NTA but you wife is. It\u2019s really inconsiderate of her to eat the sandwich when she told you the sandwich was for you when she could have ate something else or should have gotten herself a sandwich when she bought yours. Then not even apologetic is rude. She also made herself a liar by eating the sandwich she promised you.", "NTA. She bought her own sandwich too and ate it and ALSO YOURS after you skipped lunch to get the delivery. When she could have rescheduled the activity to be home to receive the delivery herself. \n\nIt\u2019s not that big a deal in the long run but I would still be annoyed. When you\u2019re looking forward to something specific and it\u2019s been eaten it is very annoying.", "Echoing what others have said: NTA. She broke her end of the deal, and expected you to get your own food. After a long day without food, the brain jumps to anger and frustration faster than it typically would. If you had had lunch, you probably wouldn\u2019t have felt so strongly about it. You still would have been disappointed and annoyed (rightfully), but less so and calmer when talking to her about it. I agree with other commenters: she could have eaten other food, or gotten an extra sandwich for herself, or shown at least remorse at not keeping her promise.", "NTA!  You skipped your time to eat so she could use her 2nd stroller a few days earlier, which was not necessary stroller but just a want. Then eats your dinner she promised?! I mean don\u2019t get me wrong, I get excited for new purchases and can be impatient. But then she could have adjusted her schedule. Plus eating the dinner she promised you, would have set me off too. \n\nShe seems awfully selfish and focuses on her wants. Forget how it\u2019s inconsiderate and extra work for order people.", "NTA. \n\nIF she had said something like, \"I'm so sorry--I know I promised to you but I was so hungry and it looked so good! I owe you one,\" then my verdict would be NAH. But to have no regret and give you no apology? Is she always this uncaring?", "NTA. You did a really big favor and she promised you a sandwich for your troubles. I really don\u2019t understand, and she had bought two and ate both???? Does she have some kind of postpartum anxiety? Has she been especially baby-centric? You even have a stroller so the delivery wasn\u2019t that important. You really went out of your way to be a good spouse. You deserve more than sandwiches. Did she even thank you for getting the package? :(", "NTA. She had her own sandwich then ate yours and told you to make yourself something instead of apologizing for eating it and offering to make you something.  I\u2019d be really disappointed. Using a lunch break to rush home as a favour is inconvenient and tends to make one feel behind for the rest of the day in my experience, then getting home to find no promised treat and just more work to do would be disheartening for sure.", "NTA. \n\nSir, you are not wrong. You were promised a sandwich. I was thinking of a N A H vote because I have eaten many items that are meant for wife. So many in fact that I have then run out and replaced said item. Fudgy the whale from carvel to be exact while she was pregnant with our kids.", "NTA, and it kinda does reflect on her morals. Not sure how you think it doesn't.", "I\u2019m guessing it looked like this\u2026\n\nWife : \u201cHey babe. Would you be a dear and accept delivery on this during your lunch break today? I have x activity with le bebe and can\u2019t split myself in half.\u201d\n\nOP : \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nWife : \u201cGreat. On my way home from activity, I\u2019ll pick up a sandwich for you because I know it\u2019s an inconvenience.\u201d\n\nOP : \u201cStellar. Thanks babe.\u201d Goes to the house, confirms delivery is safe and sound.\n\nOP : \u201cOperation Baby Mover is a success.\u201d\n\nWife : \u201cFabulous. Chicken bacon deliciousness awaits you in the fridge.\u201d\n\nOP : (driving home prolly around dinner-ish time and arrives home) \u201cHey babe. Wait\u2026where\u2019s my sammy?\u201d\n\nWife : (brushing off crumbs) \u201cOh I ate it. My bad. I know I promised you a sandwich in exchange for helping me today, but whatevs. Sorry I ate your present. You\u2019ll live.\u201d\n\nOP : (hangry af and in disbelief)\n\nI\u2019m a woman, and I\u2019ll tell you that you are 100% NTA. It isn\u2019t about the reward. It is about the fact you were looking forward to something she said she got for you as a reward and then took it away. She baited you and that sucks. This isn\u2019t about a sandwich.", "Possibly. Depends on level of reaction. 1 - 10. 1 being super chill minor voice agitations. 5 being meanest you've ever been. 10 being on the sane side of murder.", "NTA, probably a NAH situation. I'm guessing you're both just dealing with the high stress of baby raising and juggling priorities while constantly tired.\n\nReal advice is to try and mend the relationship. If you felt like you weren't being consider well or loved, that's going to effect your relationship long term. But it seems like you both made some small missteps on that front. Try to love them well and don't be afraid to communicate as long as you're using \"I statements\" in lieu of accusations. \n\nAnyways goodluck with this part of parenthood and I wish you both well!", "You ate my sandwich?!

You entered into a verbal contract with someone who you should trust about all others to keep their word. They broke the verbal contract, they broke their word, they betrayed your trust. They. Ate. The. Sandwich. They. Promised. You.", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s a really bizarre thing to do on her end.  When I first read, I thought that she ate a leftover sandwich of yours, and was more \u201cmeh, whatever\u201d but the fact that she ordered it for you and then ate it is just straight up strange and inconsiderate.\n\nIs she normally this thoughtless? \n\nAlso, I might be making a mountain out of a molehill but I have alarm bells going off about the fact that she  bought two deli sandwiches and then felt the need to eat them in a short span of time. That\u2019s like some sort of compulsive eating or something.", "NTA You are supposed to be a team which is especially important during the newborn phase. She disappointed you and didn\u2019t even think it was a big deal.", "For me, it\u2019s not that she ate the sandwich, it\u2019s that she didn\u2019t seem to give two shits about it. She could\u2019ve eaten anything else in the house, but chose to eat the one thing she promised OP.\n\nNTA", "Nta. You were hangry! I get that way too.  Maybe she will do something nice  for you soon", "NTA\n\nMore about the principle of the issue. \n\nThat she promised you a sandwich, ate it, had nothing prepared to replace it knowing you would be hungry when you walked through the door.\n\nThen acted like it was no big deal. \n\nThe deal is her being dismissive of your needs while hers were being met.", "NTA. \n\nI know the feeling well of looking forward to s specific food item at home all day only for it to be eaten during the day. It's the most disappointing feeling. She should have gotten another sandwich at the store. You deserved that sandwich not just because of the extra work but you also skipped lunch doing it!\n\nI hope you walked out and got your sandwich.", "NTA. The sandwich was part of the deal, if she was hungry then she could have made something for herself or ordered out.", "NTA- if it food with bacon then it\u2019s a crime for her to eat it. Bacon is sacred.", "NTA. That was pretty selfish of her to eat your sandwich she\u2019d promised you.

Time for a get away even a little one", "NTA\u2026at all.\n\nThat was just straight up selfish and greedy AF on your wife\u2019s part.

My comment was based on the perception that he actually \"lost it\" on her over a sandwich.\n\nESH - but you more so I think\n\nRunning back home to be there for the delivery shouldn't be seen as a favor you're doing for her, it's just part of being a parent. Also based on how you worded it, it sounds like you greatly overreacted to the situation. Sure, it wasn't super cool of her to set that expectation for you and then not follow through, but also its a fuckin sandwich man you're a big boy, you can make something for yourself.\n\nThere would be no issue if you were like \"daaang girl you did me dirty, was it good?\" or something like that and stayed playful. If it really ruined your whole day to have to make your own food, I think that's on you.

Kindness and compassion first, I promise your life would be less stressful.", "YTA.\n\nComing home so that your child can go to baby gym without missing the delivery is not a favor for your wife, it is being a parent.  \n\nI think it was unfair of your wife to eat the promised sandwich, but it is not a big enough deal for you to \"lose it\" and then sulk.  Just order another sandwich.", "YTA - Pouting over a sandwich. \u201cThe one thing she did\u2026\u201d Dude, she spent the day taking care of your child and your home.

Your attitude is \u201cshe should be grateful because I took my valuable time out to meet her delivery.\u201d  Do you not think that her day might leave her hungry, tired, and stressed? Everything you did for her? You took your lunch hour to meet her delivery.  It wasn\u2019t shit.
