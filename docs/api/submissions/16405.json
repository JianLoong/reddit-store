Wife stays with baby full time.\n\nSo, my wife\u2019s been obsessed with getting a new buggy/stroller for the baby for a few days now. She found one she wanted yesterday and ordered it instantly with next day delivery. All good so far.\n\nToday comes around, I\u2019m at work and she\u2019s taking baby for their weekly baby activity. She gets a delivery update that her new order is being delivered between 1-2pm. This is the same time baby activity is also. She calls me in a panic saying she really wants the buggy/stroller before the weekend so we can\u2019t miss the delivery but she also doesn\u2019t want to miss the baby activity today. \n\nAfter a back and forth, she requested that I go home during my lunch break and see if I catch the delivery in time. I reluctantly agree. She says she\u2019ll bring me a sandwich for my efforts. I go home, get the delivery, go straight back to work. She thanks me and tells me she\u2019ll put the sandwich in the fridge for me.\n\nNOW IT GETS JUICY! I get home from work, I\u2019m hungry, tired, stressed, you name it. The only thing keeping me going is the thought of that chicken and bacon sandwich waiting for me. I open the fridge to find no sandwich. Hmmm. I look around - nothing. My wife walks in and I ask her, \u201cwhere\u2019s my sandwich?\u201d. She tells me she got hungry and ate it. Not even an ounce of regret or anything. I lose it and say that it\u2019s not fair how she expected me to do everything I did for her today and the one thing she did in return from me - SHE ATE. She got upset about my reaction and said it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, and that I can just make myself something else to eat. I just walk off and sit by myself for a while. \n\nAITA for reacting the way I did?\n\nEdit: Baby activity could have been rescheduled to the next day. \u201cLosing it\u201d is a bit exaggerated, I was quite annoyed with her is more accurate. She also bought herself a sandwich which she had and then a few hours later she had mine.\n\nEdit 2: we already have a stroller, nothing wrong with it. She just wanted a new nicer one.\n\nEdit 3: the sandwich isn\u2019t the point here, I would have done this for nothing in return. It\u2019s more the principal that I was promised something as a reward for sacrificing my only work break to help her.\n\nEdit 4: this was a deli chicken bacon and Mayo sub. From a small store, not homemade.\n\nEdit 5: my wife is not a bad or horrible person. This doesn\u2019t reflect her morals or how she is as a person/wife/mother. Was just a one off thing we didn\u2019t see eye to eye on.\n\nUpdate: please don\u2019t message me saying horrible things about my wife. I get she did something a lil bad but remember this was just something that happened. This isn\u2019t how she always is and she\u2019s never done something like this before.

You missed lunch because you were doing her a favor (neither she nor the baby NEEDED the stroller today - it could have waited; she just WANTED it today; alternately, the baby would have zero idea if they missed one activity nor would it have any impact on their life), and she promised you the sandwich to make up for the lunch you didn't get then she turns around and eats the sandwich AFTER she got what she wanted from you. \n\nPersonally, my petty ass would go out right now, pick up her favorite take-out for just you, then take it home and eat in front of her.", "NTA! That was really inconsiderate of her. If there was other food in the house, she should have eaten that.", "NTA. Promises were broken and reaction was precedented.", "NTA, dude she promised you a delicious sandwich, you thought about it all day, then she said she ate it and to make yourself something to eat. It was just a dick move on her end she could've had a different snack than the one item you were promised.", "NTA.\n\nNeither of you were home, so you both had to compromise. She didn't hold up her end of the compromise. You're not an asshole for just being disappointed for not getting something that was promised to you.", "NTA but I might be partial cuz I fucking hate it when people eat someone else's food without asking. It doesn't even have to be like which honestly makes it much worse. You don't give someone something then just take it back for yourself later and not say a word. Hella rude. I'd be pissed off too.", "NTA I don't think the main problem here is the sandwich.   \nIt's that your wife ate something that she promised to you.", "I\u2019m definitely getting Ross Gellar vibes \n\nAnd NTA", "You ate MY sandwich!?!! MY. SANDWICH???!!!", "[removed]", "NTA- not at all. Very inconsiderate of her, to say the least.", "NTA, I think I\u2019d be most annoyed at her reaction. I feel like if she was apologetic it would be one thing, but she doesn\u2019t sound it at all.", "She absolutely did not need to go to some nonsense baby activity that required you to accommodate her on your lunch break. She ate your sandwich and didn't even think to replace it. Bit self centred but I wouldn't get hung up about it.", "NGL that kinda seems like an AH move on her part unless you had nothing else to eat in the house.  Sorry.", "NTA. I felt that.", "NTA she was rude", " NTA she shouldn\u2019t have said she\u2019d get it for you if she was going to eat it. She should have offered to go get another.", "NTA. It'd be one thing if she hadn't made it and had forgotten, but she made the sandwich and then ate it herself? That shows a pretty glaringly obvious lack of respect for anything you contribute at her request. \n\nIt's not about the ~~greek yoghurt~~ sandwich. It's about she could have found her own alternative, dragged you into it on your lunch break, then intentionally screwed you out of it. Then blamed you for having feelings about it. That's a dick move, buddy.\n\nMight want to consider suggesting therapy. Something else is going on here and this is just her being passive aggressive with it.", "I'd be pissed! If it's a one off thing, I'd let it go. If this is a usual thing it needs to be addressed.", "In the words of Ross Gellar, MY SANDWICH?!\n\nBut fr NTA. She was pretty carelessly selfish here. Does she often ask you to bend over backwards for her and then underdeliver on her end of the deal?", "Nta at all ..... im pregnan5 myself and would never do this", "NTA. \n\nI would\u2019ve DoorDashed myself an entire gourmet meal and ate it in front of her. Dramatically.", "NTA. Probably could have handled it better, but NTA.", "Nta", "Info: what kind of sandwich was it?", "NTA but you wife is. It\u2019s really inconsiderate of her to eat the sandwich when she told you the sandwich was for you when she could have ate something else or should have gotten herself a sandwich when she bought yours. Then not even apologetic is rude. She also made herself a liar by eating the sandwich she promised you.", "NTA. She bought her own sandwich too and ate it and ALSO YOURS after you skipped lunch to get the delivery. When she could have rescheduled the activity to be home to receive the delivery herself. \n\nIt\u2019s not that big a deal in the long run but I would still be annoyed. When you\u2019re looking forward to something specific and it\u2019s been eaten it is very annoying.", "Echoing what others have said: NTA. She broke her end of the deal, and expected you to get your own food. After a long day without food, the brain jumps to anger and frustration faster than it typically would. If you had had lunch, you probably wouldn\u2019t have felt so strongly about it. You still would have been disappointed and annoyed (rightfully), but less so and calmer when talking to her about it. I agree with other commenters: she could have eaten other food, or gotten an extra sandwich for herself, or shown at least remorse at not keeping her promise.", "NTA!  You skipped your time to eat so she could use her 2nd stroller a few days earlier, which was not necessary stroller but just a want. Then eats your dinner she promised?! I mean don\u2019t get me wrong, I get excited for new purchases and can be impatient. But then she could have adjusted her schedule. Plus eating the dinner she promised you, would have set me off too. \n\nShe seems awfully selfish and focuses on her wants. Forget how it\u2019s inconsiderate and extra work for order people.", "NTA. \n\nIF she had said something like, \"I'm so sorry--I know I promised to you but I was so hungry and it looked so good! I owe you one,\" then my verdict would be NAH. But to have no regret and give you no apology? Is she always this uncaring?", "NTA. You did a really big favor and she promised you a sandwich for your troubles. I really don\u2019t understand, and she had bought two and ate both???? Does she have some kind of postpartum anxiety? Has she been especially baby-centric? You even have a stroller so the delivery wasn\u2019t that important. You really went out of your way to be a good spouse. You deserve more than sandwiches. Did she even thank you for getting the package? :(", "NTA. She had her own sandwich then ate yours and told you to make yourself something instead of apologizing for eating it and offering to make you something.  I\u2019d be really disappointed. Using a lunch break to rush home as a favour is inconvenient and tends to make one feel behind for the rest of the day in my experience, then getting home to find no promised treat and just more work to do would be disheartening for sure.", "NTA. \n\nSir, you are not wrong. You were promised a sandwich. I was thinking of a N A H vote because I have eaten many items that are meant for wife. So many in fact that I have then run out and replaced said item. Fudgy the whale from carvel to be exact while she was pregnant with our kids.", "NTA, and it kinda does reflect on her morals. Not sure how you think it doesn't.", "I\u2019m guessing it looked like this\u2026\n\nWife : \u201cHey babe. Would you be a dear and accept delivery on this during your lunch break today? I have x activity with le bebe and can\u2019t split myself in half.\u201d\n\nOP : \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nWife : \u201cGreat. On my way home from activity, I\u2019ll pick up a sandwich for you because I know it\u2019s an inconvenience.\u201d\n\nOP : \u201cStellar. Thanks babe.\u201d Goes to the house, confirms delivery is safe and sound.\n\nOP : \u201cOperation Baby Mover is a success.\u201d\n\nWife : \u201cFabulous. Chicken bacon deliciousness awaits you in the fridge.\u201d\n\nOP : (driving home prolly around dinner-ish time and arrives home) \u201cHey babe. Wait\u2026where\u2019s my sammy?\u201d\n\nWife : (brushing off crumbs) \u201cOh I ate it. My bad. I know I promised you a sandwich in exchange for helping me today, but whatevs. Sorry I ate your present. You\u2019ll live.\u201d\n\nOP : (hangry af and in disbelief)\n\nI\u2019m a woman, and I\u2019ll tell you that you are 100% NTA. It isn\u2019t about the reward. It is about the fact you were looking forward to something she said she got for you as a reward and then took it away. She baited you and that sucks. This isn\u2019t about a sandwich.", "Possibly. Depends on level of reaction. 1 - 10. 1 being super chill minor voice agitations. 5 being meanest you've ever been. 10 being on the sane side of murder.", "NTA, probably a NAH situation. I'm guessing you're both just dealing with the high stress of baby raising and juggling priorities while constantly tired.\n\nReal advice is to try and mend the relationship. If you felt like you weren't being consider well or loved, that's going to effect your relationship long term. But it seems like you both made some small missteps on that front. Try to love them well and don't be afraid to communicate as long as you're using \"I statements\" in lieu of accusations. \n\nAnyways goodluck with this part of parenthood and I wish you both well!", "You ate my sandwich?! MY! SANDWICH?!", "NTA. Offer her some takeout in a week or 2.

But I am serious about food", "nta \n\nid be pissed too. it\u2019s just the principle yk, you skipped out on lunch to do something for her that wasn\u2019t even necessary and then she took away the thing SHE offered YOU as a reward for ur kindness. she better get u 2 sandwiches man.", "NTA. You entered into a verbal contract with someone who you should trust about all others to keep their word. They broke the verbal contract, they broke their word, they betrayed your trust. They. Ate. The. Sandwich. They. Promised. You.", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s a really bizarre thing to do on her end.  When I first read, I thought that she ate a leftover sandwich of yours, and was more \u201cmeh, whatever\u201d but the fact that she ordered it for you and then ate it is just straight up strange and inconsiderate.\n\nIs she normally this thoughtless? \n\nAlso, I might be making a mountain out of a molehill but I have alarm bells going off about the fact that she  bought two deli sandwiches and then felt the need to eat them in a short span of time. That\u2019s like some sort of compulsive eating or something.", "NTA You are supposed to be a team which is especially important during the newborn phase. She disappointed you and didn\u2019t even think it was a big deal.", "For me, it\u2019s not that she ate the sandwich, it\u2019s that she didn\u2019t seem to give two shits about it. She could\u2019ve eaten anything else in the house, but chose to eat the one thing she promised OP.\n\nNTA", "Nta. You were hangry! I get that way too.  Maybe she will do something nice  for you soon", "NTA\n\nMore about the principle of the issue. \n\nThat she promised you a sandwich, ate it, had nothing prepared to replace it knowing you would be hungry when you walked through the door.\n\nThen acted like it was no big deal. \n\nThe deal is her being dismissive of your needs while hers were being met.", "NTA. \n\nI know the feeling well of looking forward to s specific food item at home all day only for it to be eaten during the day. It's the most disappointing feeling. She should have gotten another sandwich at the store. You deserved that sandwich not just because of the extra work but you also skipped lunch doing it!\n\nI hope you walked out and got your sandwich.", "NTA. The sandwich was part of the deal, if she was hungry then she could have made something for herself or ordered out.", "NTA- if it food with bacon then it\u2019s a crime for her to eat it. Bacon is sacred.", "NTA. That was pretty selfish of her to eat your sandwich she\u2019d promised you.

It is more than the sandwich it\u2019s that both of you need some consideration and appreciation for all that you do but you both tired and hungry! Time for a get away even a little one", "NTA\u2026at all.\n\nThat was just straight up selfish and greedy AF on your wife\u2019s part.

When it was suggested by another commenter that he go get her favorite takeout and eat that for dinner he responded something similar to that he wouldn\u2019t be alive after that, meaning she wouldn\u2019t tolerate him eating something she enjoyed without her also partaking in it.  Her actions throughout the entire day (not for just a minute of an over-stressed mother) showed no consideration for his time or his needs.  And it is not a pattern of behavior that shows a momentary lapse in judgement, which is why I think she is deserving of being called an asshole.", "Well I hope nobody is stuck coparenting with you \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "that\u2019s a fair point. the \u201coh you can make yourself something else\u201d after eating it sounded shitty as fuck to me but i get that it could be coming from a lot of different places & not be a recurring thing. \n\nalso though.. not sure what kind of \u201csolutions\u201d we can offer OP based on, as you said, her being an asshole 1 time.", "I've been a SAHM for nearly 30 years. If you don't figure out early how to carve breaks into your day via naptimes, tummy time, swing time, etc, you burn out quickly. Just because the child is present doesn't mean you can't take a break.", "She's a new mom.", "I don\u2019t see \u201cpromise\u201d in his post anywhere. Also, you are glossing over the fact that she is the stay at home parent. He may not know what\u2019s wrong with current stroller. Maybe it makes her life really difficult and this new one will make it easier. Baby activity is for babies and their parents. Likely her only socialization outside of her husband who is now screaming about sandwiches. I\u2019m thinking that the woman who just gave birth, is still recovering and breast feeding, probably gets hungry sometimes. If I were exhausted, covered in spit up, cradling a baby, starving as my body is akin to a workhorse, and there was a sandwich already to go? Would be pretty tempting. Also, read his edits, jesus. His life has not been ruined by a sandwich. His wife is not Satan in the flesh. She ate a sandwich.", "> Why would he make a sandwich if she told him she'd get him one?\n\nbecause it was lunchtime & he was hungry?! had the entire situation not happened i assume he would have gotten himself something for lunch while at his office. this 'well-deserved' sandwich was going to be waiting for him at home once he was finished with work (aka as 'dinner'). OP is ridiculous for 1) thinking that doing something that benefits HIS OWN CHILD is somehow praiseworthy & then lashing out 'I lose it and say that it\u2019s not fair how she expected me **to do everything I did for her today**' um, what? he got in his car & drove home & signed for a package. good grief *THE SACRIFICE* and 2) allowing himself to be hungry all day waiting with bated breath for this almighty sandwich and 3) getting so bent out of shape about it that he needs to made a damn reddit post about it.\n\ni wonder how many things his wife has done (besides, you know, being pregnant for 9 months & then pushing a kid out of her vagina) that he might ever consider to be deserving of some accommodation.", "See, I would argue that were getting sucked into the gimmick of the sub by going back and forth at all. I don't think either of us knows for sure and I just am not cool calling this guys wife an asshole for a bad day. My partner is selfish like this sometimes, but typically they are caring and considerate.\n\nI'd wager there's more logic to OPs wife than just \"I don't really care about my husband or my promises\" because we don't live in a cartoon world where there are always clear-cut villains.", "Only solution there is order take out if you don't want to cook, but that still sucks as he was looking forward to an already made sandwich and could just relax and eat right away. \n\nI am so greatful my parent doesn't ever do this.", "Tell him to have a nice talk with her. \"I was really looking forward to it... I felt like you didn't value me,,, etc\"\n\nAsk him to really examine IF there's any area that he's lacking it, which may have prompted her to act in such a manner. She's still wrong for it, but he's looking for solutions, not to place blame", "You are saying a break as a SAHM is the same as someone at work like an office job as the OP sounds like~ he has an hour uninterrupted. The guy is acting like he made SUCH A SACRIFICE. When the mom most likely shoves food in her mouth whenever she gets a chance between all the things you listed plus a billion more. Whoop dee doo he had to come home. Yes it\u2019s not cool she ate the sandwich he was promised. But she was probably sick of his crying over missing one freaking lunch break which she doesn\u2019t ever get.", "Then maybe wifey should communicate? Sigh.", "I respect that.  And honestly, I\u2019m coming from a place where my previous partner was very selfish and narcissistic and I honestly never was a priority, so the whole \u201ctoday is just a bad day for them\u201d scenario didn\u2019t exist.  It\u2019s interesting to see how our different life experiences effect our judgements.  And I\u2019m happy your partner is only occasionally selfish.  That is something I haven\u2019t experienced, but hope to.  You give me hope.  And also, thank you for this honest internet discourse where we were able to share our viewpoints without being rude or disrespectful to each other.  It was refreshing.  \ud83d\udc95", "The things I listed are good times to take breaks, not tasks that require active participation. \n\nSome days she probably does eat on the go; likewise OP likely eats at his desk some days. Other days she can sit down to eat while baby naps or has tummy time; likewise he probably has days he can sit in the break room or his car. It isn't, or shouldn't be, a competition. Both their jobs have struggles and benefits, good days and not so good days. \n\nIf a SAHP is NEVER getting a lunch break, they need to reevaluate how much they're trying to cram into a day. Every SAHP I've ever known (and we homeschool so I know a lot of them) has learned how to create breaks for themselves. It can take trial and error, cutting back on some activities, and sometimes getting advice from other parents, but it's something SAHPs NEED to learn how to do for their own well-being. \n\nThe fact remains she showed not even a shred of remorse, nor did she offer to replace the sandwich, cook or order him something else, or even let him know before he got home the sandwich was no longer there which would have allowed him to pick up a replacement himself. Any of those things would have rectified the situation. She just didn't care enough about him to bother.", "Um?? It's a choice to be a SAHM. Don't want to have to cram lunch breaks that are more of a one second breather before being tossed back into the mosh pit of taking care of a baby? Don't be a SAHM. Or, even better, don't have a child if you aren't ready for the relationship??\n\nHusband sacrificed HIS lunch to get something they didn't even need that urgently due to his WIFEs begging. Then, when he comes home, keeping it cool on the sole fact of a good sandwich, he arrives to be told SHE ate the sandwich. And it's not that she only got one, no, she bought one for herself already. And feels no remorse. Doesn't try to make up for it. If you don't see the issue, then sorry. But OP isn't unreasonable to be mad. He's emotionally stressed and hungry, that leads to spiked emotions and irrational anger. Hangry. You ever hear that word?\n\nI'm not saying being a SAHM isn't stressful even if you chose it, but it doesn't excuse mistreating the people willing to go home just for a stroller she won't need until when???\n\nEdit: oh, and did I mention she's a SAHM? More than likely NOT working? He brings the money in, and funds her and the babies lives (out of love, mind you) and she can't even save a sandwich for him??", "Let's take away your lunch and then leave you to fend for yourself for dinner after you were promised dinner would be there and see how you feel.", "Right. I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s up with the communication as well. If she is overwhelmed or tired or extra hungry she could\u2019ve been like \u201cI know I told you I\u2019d get you the sandwich but I was so hungry. I\u2019ve just been overwhelmed lately.\u201d And if she was tired and covered in spit Etc., she should\u2019ve told him that. Instead, she basically called him a jerk for looking forward to a treat when he got home. She could\u2019ve tried to see his point of view.", "Ya caught me on an off day. Trying to be authentic ok the internet is exhausting and ive mostly stopped engaging. I wanted to see if GPT4 could write a good response for this guy and it couldn't and I didn't want him to call her an asshole because of redditors lol.\n\nThank you for not making me regret getting sucked into redditing again.", "It\u2019s nice having a legit human connection on the internet sometimes.  It\u2019s honestly a hard thing nowadays.  So much vitriol and nastiness.  But I\u2019m glad we interacted.  It\u2019s made me a little less cynical\u2026today anyway.  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude09"]}
