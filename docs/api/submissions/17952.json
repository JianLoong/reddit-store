She must've been a fish in her past life, because she absolutely love swimming more than anything in the world. We live near a lake and she and her friends have basically spent the past six summers there every day, I even got her a cold water wetsuit so she can swim in the cold months.\n\nShe's obviously very good at it by now, and when she started high school she tried the swim team. She didn't enjoy it, since the teams are very structured and there's really only a few things they do, which ruined the fun for her. She does chess club now instead, which I was fine with, but not her dad.\n\nHe thinks we're letting a big opportunity pass her by, and should be supporting her skills. He's spent the last two years heckling her to try it, since she probably could go far in the sport. She's tried to explain to him that making swimming an obligation ruins the fun for her, but he won't listen.\n\nLast week a friend of her's dropped her off at my house with a bag packed. Apparently he more or less yelled at her that she's wasting her potential \"having fun\" and that she needs to grow up and act responsible. He said no college is going to want her because of her chess club, and that she cares more about goofing off than her future. She got upset enough that she left and came here.\n\nWhen I heard, I called her father once I was out of earshot and tore him a new one.

That goes for any sport really.  So her just being on a swim team will not mean anything to a college because she is just one of thousands applying with the same clubs/sports.", "NTA. As someone who worked in Admissions at an Ivy League school, I can guarantee that doing something she loves and can write about with enthusiasm is much more compelling than participating in organized sports, and her non-competitive swimming sounds like it could make for a great personal essay. \n\nAlso, what she loves is of much more value to HER, and that\u2019s even more important.", "Nta\n\nGood on you for standing up for your daughter.\n\nMy father was the same. Im in my early 30s now and last talked to him when I was 17. That's pretty much what's likely going to await him too if he keeps pushing her for his ego's sake.", "NTA - At 16yrs old most judges would allow her to choose the parent she wants to live with.  You have a good chance at getting full custody, if you want to go for it.  He's the one alienating her affection by trying to push into a sport she doesn't enjoy.  There is a huge difference between liking a hobby and playing the sport.  Swimming can come at a price of other social or athletic development that she might enjoy more.  There's no guarantee of a college scholarship even if she does well, and if her heart isn't in it she's not going to do all that well.\n\nYou made the right choice.  Don't let him bully you...and talk to a lawyer.", "NTA  she of age she can tell the courts herself how he is.... you are right she will go no contact with her dad... and swimming  is fun for her... she can get I to college by doing chess and whatever other activities  there are out there... \nDad is a major AH...", "My daughter did swim team and is an instructor/lifeguard. She wasn't crazy about competitive swimming, especially the shorter distances.\n\nYour daughter is right, swim team isn't the same as lake swimming, endurance swimming, or even the swimming you do for guarding.  (lol no cheap jokes please!)\n\nGood for you OP, for standing up for your daughter. You are NTA, but your husband definitely is.", "NTA. There are plenty of other things she can do to get into a good college. Forcing her to do swimming just because she\u2019s good at it will ruin the relationship with her father more than it will help her get into a good college.", "NTA. She gave it a try, it wasn\u2019t for her, and she\u2019s old enough to decide things like this for herself. Her father is not respecting her wishes and you\u2019re right to defend her.", "NTA\n\nBoth of my kids were on swim team in high school, and both only lasted a year on the high school team.  During swim team season, the practices are 3 hours per day (not including morning practice) for six days a week.  Meets could be as long as 5 hours at invitationals.  It's a lot.  And the highly competitive swimmers are on private teams in the off season, doing hours of swimming most every day all year round, plus additional strength training and stuff.  \n\nI've also known multiple families that spent thousands of dollars a year on travel sports (soccer, softball, baseball, etc..). Many of those families have done so with the expectation that their child would get college scholarships.  And very few of them do.\n\nYour daughter is as likely to get accepted to a decent college because she chose to practice chess as if she was a competitive swimmer.  There's no significance of one over the other.\n\nIf he takes you to court, counter file for full custody, adjustment of support, and to have support extend through your daughter's college years.  If he wants to play stupid games, he can win stupid prizes.", "NTA\n\nTake the threat of a lawsuit seriously. He has no chance of winning because your daughter is old enough to pick the parent, but he can really stick it to you financially.  You may want to suggest family counseling.", "NTA - Let him take you to court.  He has no case.  Seriously, does he think the judge is going to say \"He's right, your daughter should be miserable so he can have something to brag about\"  Nooo Waaay, for fucks sake.  If your daughter does not want to swim then she doesn't have to.  You hit the nail on the head that if he pursues this course of action he will be damaging that relationship.", "NTA\n\nIf a person doesn\u2019t have a passion for something it becomes a chore when there is a lot of work involved.  She tried the swim team, and hated it.  Enough said.\n\nDoes he think colleges will come recruiting her?  Guess what, it is HIGHLY unlikely.  Swim just does not bring in the $$$ and women\u2019s swimming even less so.  Just how it is.  People who compete do so because they have a personal drive to do it.  \n\nYou did exactly right, he Will completely damage his relationship with his daughter if he keeps it up.", "NTA. At all. Keep supporting your daughter!\n\nI wish more people realized that you don't have to monetize everything you love. She's allowed to love swimming without thinking about what kinds of scholarships it might get her. Like, yes, on the one hand, if you have a talent it would probably serve you well to use it as a career, but at the same time.... Then what do you do to unwind at the end of the day? You don't do something professionally and then want to go home and do it for yourself too -- at that point you've spent most of your energy on what someone else wants. \n\nLike.... My love in life was always art. But the worst thing about it was that people always wanted to push me to do it professionally. I didn't -- and still don't -- want to spend all of my creative energy on someone else's projects because at the end of the day, I'll come home and have no creative energy left for me. Sure, in a pinch I can open commission slots or something, but generally I do art for *me* and *me alone*. \n\nYour ex sounds really controlling. It's really really good that your daughter has someone watching out for her.", "NTA.  Call your lawyer first thing in the morning.  In most states your daughter is old enough to decide where she wants to live and if it\u2019s not with him because of this behavior, then make it so.  He wants to involve the courts and make threats then by all means you beat him to the punch.", "NTA, in most state at the age of 16 she can inform the courts where she wants to live.  She can also talk to the courts about the verbal abuse from her dad.  Talk to your lawyer.", "NTA and your ex is living in a fantasy world if he thinks someone that takes up swimming at age 16 is going to go far in the sport competitively. Your daughter can swim for fun, but whatever he was thinking in his head\u2014 Olympic trials, college scholarships\u2014 the opportunity for that in swimming passed your daughter years ago.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But even if she did want to, your husband doesn't understand how the sport really works on an elite level in 2023. It's already too late for your daughter to be a viable recruit to a college team. She cannot compete against people who've been training proper competitive swimming through puberty. That's just how swimming is, it's a very unfair sport. This isn't about her welfare, it's about his need for control.

He's clearly disregarding your daughter's wishes for what he wants. He's putting his own happiness before hers, and if he keeps it up he might run her off altogether.

Not everything needs to be for college applications. Maybe it'll look better that swimming is a hobby and chess is a club."]}
