{"id": 22003, "submission_id": "14xeug3", "title": "AITA For calling myself a Veteran even though I only served for a year?", "selftext": "As the title says, I was in The United States marine corps for a little over a year. A little back ground, I joined the military on Nov 8, 2021 and served until Dec 2, 2022. I graduated boot camp in early feb. 2022. After that I went to MCT and graduated from there in March. I then went to my MOS school and it\u2019s here where everything went down. It was sometime around May that I was assigned to be a MAT platoon (Marine Awaiting Training Platoon) Platoon leader. Basically my job was to make sure everybody was accounted for and we\u2019re going to where they needed to according to the plan of the day. Well one morning around 4am I was making my rounds making sure everyone was awake and accounted for and on their way to morning formation/ PT. There was one marine that didn\u2019t answer his door(which was a normal occurrence) so I moved on down the list of guy I need to wake up. After I finished the list I went back to that one marines door and knocked again. No answer. So I went next door to the room that shared a bathroom and woke those guys up to let me in. The guy who came to was a dude I had gone to boot camp with so he let me through without fuss. I go into my marines room fuming. My anger then turns to panic when I seen him lying in a pool of his own vomit and not breathing. I immediately started CPR and told the other marine to go and get duty. The NCO tells me to continue with CPR as he calls 911 a few minutes before they arrived I was able to get his heart started again, however that didn\u2019t last long, his pulsed stop and wouldn\u2019t come back. No matter how hard I tried. This was someone I was supposed to be responsible for and now he\u2019s gone. Turns out he intentionally overdosed on his medication for an injury he sustained. A few days later I was brought to medical for a physical and mental evaluation. It was there that I was diagnosed with PTSD. They started making me go to therapy twice a week with a therapist and delayed my training until I was fit to train. They also put me on a few drugs for depression and PTSD. After a few months of therapy and staying in the barracks most days, not being able to leave base for any reason other than medical. We would have to stand guard for 12 hours on 12 hours off, for weeks at a time. Well one night I had been awake for 48 hours prior because I had the night shift . And had to run errands during the day. My flashbacks and anxiety were at an all time high. And I ended up taking way too much of my prescription. I was rushed to the hospital. Few weeks after I got out of the hospital I was told I was being discharged from military service. I was given a General discharge under honorable conditions. Which gives me access to all veteran benefits I had earned up until that point. I\u2019m out now but I still feel like a fraud when I use my VA benefits. Am I really and asshole for using my benefits even though I only served for a year?", "created_utc": 1689139077, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xeug3/aita_for_calling_myself_a_veteran_even_though_i/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you'd been discharged for being shot after a year you would not question it at all.

If you\u2019re fully entitled to VA benefits, then you should feel okay to use them. Some people will give you cr@p because it doesn\u2019t sound like you completed all training, but you survived boot camp and you didn\u2019t go out of your way to dip out. People who voluntarily dip out of boot camp after only a couple of weeks but still want to be called veterans are the real problem. Reminds me of Adam Driver\u2019s story, who ended up getting injured right before his platoon was supposed to ship out on their first deployment. He has said that he feels less of a veteran because he didn\u2019t deploy while his buddies did.", "If you had stepped on a mine 6 months aftere enlisting you'd call yourself a veteran. The length of service is irrelevant. \n\nYou got injured rescuing a fellow Marine. The fact that the injury is not physical is irrelevant. This injury is severe enough to warrant discharge. The Marine Corps said so. You didn't get to decide for yourself whether you were still fit enough to serve did you? And now you don't get to decide whether to call yourself a veteran and get the associated benefits. That's for the Corps to decide.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  \n\nYou served the time they gave you.
