A few days ago was the birthday party of my cousin Hillery (F25). We aren't close at all but we see each other at family events and holidays. We never really disliked each other like most cousins, might just be because of our tremendous age gap though. Back in 2020, Hillery got sick. She thought it was corona initially and it was, but tests showed she also had cancer. I learned of this at Christmas that year and honestly got super emo. I now have made a point of asking about her health whenever I see her.\n\nAt Hillery's birthday party, I was there with my mom. My and Hillery's moms are sisters if you were wondering. It was Hillery's gold birthday (Feb 25), one she didn't know if she'd reach, so it was real celebratory. When I got the chance, I started small talk with her. I indirectly brought up her cancer to which Hillery responded, \"haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?\" I said no, and she explained that she\u2019d been cancer-free since early January. I was so happy because I\u2019m a pessimist and didn't consider that she could be better!\n\nI was confused why I hadn't known about Hillery since she found out 2 months ago, but I assumed she only told her unextended family so far. I asked her if anyone besides me knew she was free, to which she said ofc. As one would, I assumed she meant only her parents and friends. I then took an opportunity to make her party Xtra special. I understand what I did next might've not been my place. I stood up on my chair and said \"Can I have your attention? Hillery\u2019s cancer-free!\" There was silence with people looking at each other before they started awkwardly clapping on or cheering.\n\nThe room didn't hush up, and I soon understood that everyone already knew Hillery no longer had cancer. I asked Hillery and she whispered, \"Shelly I thought you knew!\" Everyone there knew... except my mom (and me prior to the party since I only would\u2019ve known from my mom). My mom confronted Hillery's mom about why she wasn\u2019t told about Hillery's remission. Hillery's mom told my mom that she didn't know how to tell her because she\u2019s \"difficult\" to talk with about serious topics. My mom gave her a \"what's that sposed to mean\" which began the typical sisterly bicker at gatherings. This was the first time one of their arguments involved Hillery though, and on her birthday!\n\nAfter a few minutes of the moms arguing, that was the end of the party, at least for me \u2018cause Hillery's mom kicked my mom out and we\u2019d come together in my range rover. On the way out, Hillery had a word with me and said she wished I hadn't gotten our moms riled up. As Hillery's mom was shooing me out, I asked Hillery for her number so I could explain myself. However, the last thing she said to me is that it's best if me and my mom never interact with her and hers again. Ouch, AITA? I hope this post belongs here because I inadvertently started an interpersonal conflict between two other people which ignited an interpersonal conflict with me and Hilary.", "created_utc": 1677639346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11es8g5/aita_for_ruining_my_cousins_birthday_party_by/", "score": 592, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s ***super weird*** that your aunt didn\u2019t want to tell her sister that her daughter was in remission. That\u2019s wonderful news. So why not share it? There\u2019s clearly a larger issue here, ~~so it\u2019s hard to say whether or not Hillery\u2019s statement to go \u201cno contact\u201d with herself and her mother was warranted~~\n\nThough, if it were me, and my cousin announced my medical news to the guests attending my birthday party, which lead to a fight between my mother and aunt, I\u2019d definitely go no contact too.\n\nETA: I just sat here and thought about this more.

I don't think it's normal to dislike most of your cousins. I think it's worth taking a little time to consider why you really dislike most of your cousins, and why they might dislike you. If nothing else, try thinking of them as people you might never be best friends with, but they are family who don't mean you harm, and you wish them well, from a distance.\n\nIt's never okay to publicly broadcast anyone else's private business.

The only thing that you possibly could have done, can do now, is to tell your mother that you will not bring her places if she is going to be rude to your hosts, and when she does start causing a scene, take her out of there as quietly as you can. Even if you hadn't made your announcement, she might have heard it from another person and still decided to cause the scene. All you could have done is told her to chill and brought her outside to calm down or go home.\n\nIs it fair that a 19 year old has to regulate her (presumably) adult mother in full mental health? No, but if you bring someone to a party, you owe the host a minimum level of concern for what that person does.\n\nFinally, this might be completely off base, but if your mother is a person who behaves badly under the influence of mood-altering substances, I hear good things about support groups for family members.", "This is a weird one.

If you're at someone else's party and want to start any sentence with \"may I have your attention please\" that is not followed by \"I propose a toast to (person whose event it is)\" that does not include their personal news, just don't.\n\nExample: I'd like to propose a toast to Hillary. Happy birthday, Hillery! Is fine but \"congratulations to Hillery on being cancer-free is not, because the party was not about her being cancer-free.", "I honestly can\u2019t believe you would ever, in a million years think it is okay to share someone\u2019s medical news! You\u2019re 19, not 5. I am 110% confident my 9-year-old would even know that this is a major no-no. Why would that ever be your news to share? \n\nHonestly, you just sound attention seeking and childish. You should be embarrassed and you should write your cousin a letter apologizing.", "This is some Michael Scott kinda shit", "I have yet to read an AITA story where op standing on a chair announcing something wasn\u2019t the AH.", "YTA- even is she hasn\u2019t told people, why the actual f*ck would you think it was your job to make the announcement????", "OP, where do I start? You clearly aren't now and never have been that close to your cousin. You had ZERO right to stand up and make an announcement like that at her birthday party. You give off those \"I gotta make everything about me vibes as well\"\nYou were so torn up about your cousin having cancer that you haven't bothered to check up on her at all. Get over yourself... YTA", "YTA\n\nWho the fuck thinks it's their place to make an announcement about somebody else's health like that?!\n\nAn you didn't even have her number! So you are probably almost strangers to one another...", "YTA. Why would you think you get to make any announcements about anyone\u2019s health.  You weren\u2019t trying to make her party extra special.  There are so many reasons she may not have told everyone yet.", "YTA and i dont get it. You didnt know your cousin was cancer free. You assumed only a few people knew. It was her Birthday. So instead of thinking your cousin wants to announce shes cancer free at her birthday party you thought she wants you to tell everyone that Message?", "INFO: Why do you think that \"most cousins\" dislike each other?\n\nI ask because that does not line up with my observations at all, so a) I'm curious and b) I'm wondering if your extended family is so full of drama and squabbling that this might be an E S H situation where the family always has someone on the outs that everyone else can exclude/judge/laugh at and it just happened to be you and your mom this time. (You'd be an AH either way for announcing your cousin's news to her own family at her own party; if you were left out of the good news on purpose it wouldn't excuse what you did, but it could mean everyone else also sucks.)", "YTA...u already knew it.  Yta x2 for dropping ur \"range rover\"  in the story.   Nobody cares. It's not the flex u think it is.", "I wasn't really thinking at the time whose place it was, I just thought it was something people needed to hear.", "I guess I just didn't think it through enough before speaking.", "I guess I just assumed that since she'd already told some people - and now shared it with someone like me that she's not close with - that she'd be ok if everyone knew.", "No... I don't have any disabilities or any diagnosed conditions in general.", "I\u2019m thinking this attitude is connected to the part where she acts like her mom and aunt fighting at a family event is just usual birthday fun. Her mom is that aunt that starts drama, *thats* why she thinks cousins normally hate each other, because they all hate *her*. She just never noticed the rest don\u2019t because she\u2019s clearly not good at paying attention to others.", "You realize that the world does not in fact revolve around you right??", "But why??? And why did you think they needed to hear it from you, of all people? This was not your news to share and I'm absolutely baffled that you don't seem to get that.", "Yes and not your place \n\nIt was hers", "Question: what does the type of car you drive have to do with your cousin and her being cancer free?", "Thanks for your answer.   I'm quite sure you've been roasted enough by this sub so I'll just provide a light YTA based on this ruling.   It was somewhat careless and thoughtless but I don't think the outcome can be blamed on you.  Sounds like a few decades of sisterly  rivalry had built up and the dam burst.  Seems like this blowout was long overdue and if it wasn't this event, something else would've been the catalyst.\n\nDon't know why everyone is picking on you for being a range rover woman.", "But why are you the one to tell everyone?", "But why did you decide to announce something that had nothing to do with you???", "Seems like you need to stop assuming and thinking then", "Still doesn't explain why you felt the NEED to announce to the group like a teacher bringing a student to the front of the room to congratulate for a 'job well done'\n\nIt's as awkward as fcuk", "Cool cool cool...\n\nSo then what the hell is wrong with you??!\n\n YTA! Regardless of fact you weren't close with this cousin... even if you 2 were as close as sisters, where the hell do you get off sharing HER medical information without her consent...?\nEven all of the above aside, she found out 2 months ago, if SHE hadn't made a big announcement what made you think it would be appropriate for YOU to make one??\n\nYour nonchalance about it is concerning but moreso annoying... YTA big time. Sounds like they've been looking for an excuse to go NC with y'all. Good job there!", "You do have them. You should figure out what they are.", "IKR \ud83d\ude02", "That single detail makes me wonder if this is bait.", "Ofc she has range rover!", "Michael Scott should be judged on the results of his actions, not his good-intentions.  And many times his intentions are purely petty.\n\nBut the best part of Michael Scott is how great a boss he turned out to be -  Jim.", "Well she is a range rover woman.", "I got a similar feeling when she said the original diagnosis got her \u201csuper emo\u201d.", "Attention. That's why.", "Yes!", "She spelled the cousins name 2 different ways.", "My first thought.", "They're a finisher car! A transporter of Gods, The Golden God", "Exactly"]}
