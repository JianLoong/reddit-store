A few days ago was the birthday party of my cousin Hillery (F25). We aren't close at all but we see each other at family events and holidays. We never really disliked each other like most cousins, might just be because of our tremendous age gap though. Back in 2020, Hillery got sick. She thought it was corona initially and it was, but tests showed she also had cancer. I learned of this at Christmas that year and honestly got super emo. I now have made a point of asking about her health whenever I see her.\n\nAt Hillery's birthday party, I was there with my mom. My and Hillery's moms are sisters if you were wondering. It was Hillery's gold birthday (Feb 25), one she didn't know if she'd reach, so it was real celebratory. When I got the chance, I started small talk with her. I indirectly brought up her cancer to which Hillery responded, \"haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?\" I said no, and she explained that she\u2019d been cancer-free since early January. I was so happy because I\u2019m a pessimist and didn't consider that she could be better!\n\nI was confused why I hadn't known about Hillery since she found out 2 months ago, but I assumed she only told her unextended family so far. I asked her if anyone besides me knew she was free, to which she said ofc. As one would, I assumed she meant only her parents and friends. I then took an opportunity to make her party Xtra special. I understand what I did next might've not been my place. I stood up on my chair and said \"Can I have your attention? Hillery\u2019s cancer-free!\" There was silence with people looking at each other before they started awkwardly clapping on or cheering.\n\nThe room didn't hush up, and I soon understood that everyone already knew Hillery no longer had cancer. I asked Hillery and she whispered, \"Shelly I thought you knew!\" Everyone there knew... except my mom (and me prior to the party since I only would\u2019ve known from my mom). My mom confronted Hillery's mom about why she wasn\u2019t told about Hillery's remission. Hillery's mom told my mom that she didn't know how to tell her because she\u2019s \"difficult\" to talk with about serious topics. My mom gave her a \"what's that sposed to mean\" which began the typical sisterly bicker at gatherings. This was the first time one of their arguments involved Hillery though, and on her birthday!\n\nAfter a few minutes of the moms arguing, that was the end of the party, at least for me \u2018cause Hillery's mom kicked my mom out and we\u2019d come together in my range rover. On the way out, Hillery had a word with me and said she wished I hadn't gotten our moms riled up. As Hillery's mom was shooing me out, I asked Hillery for her number so I could explain myself. However, the last thing she said to me is that it's best if me and my mom never interact with her and hers again. Ouch, AITA? I hope this post belongs here because I inadvertently started an interpersonal conflict between two other people which ignited an interpersonal conflict with me and Hilary.", "created_utc": 1677639346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11es8g5/aita_for_ruining_my_cousins_birthday_party_by/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s ***super weird*** that your aunt didn\u2019t want to tell her sister that her daughter was in remission. That\u2019s wonderful news. So why not share it? There\u2019s clearly a larger issue here, ~~so it\u2019s hard to say whether or not Hillery\u2019s statement to go \u201cno contact\u201d with herself and her mother was warranted~~\n\nThough, if it were me, and my cousin announced my medical news to the guests attending my birthday party, which lead to a fight between my mother and aunt, I\u2019d definitely go no contact too.\n\nETA: I just sat here and thought about this more.
