It's probably happening with other male coworkers but I can't speak on their behalf. I work in an office and have a normal friendly relationship with my coworkers. We joke at times and have gone for drinks after work. None of these people are my best friends or anything but I'm cool with them, including the women. Recently a new woman was hired and shortly after that we received a message from HR. They said that we were going to have some employee conduct & harassment meeting. They brought in a speaker and we watched some videos and did an online test like at a job orientation. Basically we learned to keep conversations work focused. Avoid or limit conversations after hours or not at the job. Obvious things like never make comments on physical appearance or do anything inappropriate. They even gave acted out examples. There was a video of a someone bumping into a coworker at the park and they showed the right and wrong examples. The right was just basic formalities and keeping it moving. The wrong was extending the conversation and asking about their day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't think anything of it because we have HR meetings like this from time to time. Never this extensive though. The new employee pretty much said that she asked for this meeting to happen. She said that she agreed with everything we learned and that it was good to know. Now I'm not here to judge her or say she did the wrong thing. I don't know what she experienced in short time she's worked here or at a previous job. I don't know the kind of life she has lived or what she's gone through.  I really don't want this to become people saying \"don't trust women\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was at a coffee shop after work and she came in shortly after me and tried to strike up a conversation. I kept it friendly and short and then resumed what I was doing. She seemed put off by that. And then literally the similar situation to the video I mentioned happened. I was at the grocery store, we bumped into each other, I said short small talk things and wished her a nice day. With my other coworkers, including women, I am more buddy buddy and we have inside jokes. My coworkers buy me birthday presents and we have a good time. Me and new coworker work in the same small department so she interacts with me a lot. She approached me and said that I am ignoring and isolating her. I told her I just don't want anything to be misconstrued. I keep it professional. If I'm ordering coffee/food for the group. I order ask what she wants. I just make sure to not bring up personal life stuff with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit\n\nI'll copy and paste a comment I left here\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I'm just lost at like her getting HR to show us how to properly interact with a coworker. And then me interacting with her in the way HR showed makes her upset. I get that she could have gone through something in the past. Just don't know what she wants from me. I'm doing what HR suggested. I'm obviously not going to give my coworkers I already have a bond/friendship with the cold shoulder to accommodate to one new person. She said she agreed with everything we learned from HR so I am just applying it. I'm not doing this out of some lame \"revenge\" desire.

Consider how you feel about the training and guidelines that were provided, how you feel about her for being the initiator of that process, and whether you might be taking it further than necessary to prove a point. \n\nThis is a common experience for women who raise any concerns re workplace behaviour, and it's a strong factor contributing to women putting up with inappropriate behaviour, particularly from influential men. The consequences of raising concerns often include ostracism from normal interactions, which often results in less opportunities etc. \n\nIf your immediate reaction to that is along the lines of \"then she should suck it up and tolerate the behaviour without involving HR\" I'm sorry to tell you you're part of the problem. There's a big range of reasonable behaviour between freezing someone out socially and being inappropriate/harassing. If you're unclear on why your behaviour might be perceived as inappropriate and you default to cold professionalism when someone raises concerns, chances are you're doing inappropriate stuff and either not realising or not caring. The other women who appear to be OK with the interactions may actually be uncomfortable but know you're going to make things harder for them if they raise concerns so they stay quiet about it to protect their career. \n\nI don't know whether that's what's happening here but if you feel angry at this comment, that's worth reflecting on cause you might be crossing more lines than you realise or are willing to admit, even to yourself.", "NTA.

Other people can be overbearing with friendliness, or indeed, actually use that to hit on or pressure coworkers.  \n\nBut this sort of one-size-fits-all attempt at preventing potential issues by just... suggesting that everyone basically act like near-strangers, is going to cause issues in the company in other ways.  \n\nI guess I kind of partly see it as cowardice on the part of the company and HR.  (Not even this particular company, but in terms of the trends over the years.)  Companies are so scared of being sued.  HR is often scared of dealing with actual issues or discipline, because they're scared that an employee who's reprimanded or terminated with cause will still try to sue the company (and even if they lose, will cost the company money going through the process).  \n\nSo it really comes back to money, doesn't it?  (And partly, to PR.)  HR has been told to avoid costing the company money in legal fees or settlements, most likely.

Yet, maybe the bosses\u2019 boss kept calling with threats, and a week after the incident this woman decided to go to HR. Then, the day after she went to HR, other employees who were friends with the bosses\u2019 boss began to file complaints about her, and even though she had given HR all of the information about what happened including police reports, emails, and a voicemail that some old lady who didn\u2019t understand how phones worked accidentally left on this woman\u2019s work phone where she was talking with another employee about how they were going to file false complaints about her, she was still fired. Then, maybe she went to HR, and she was told that it was an at-will state and she could be fired for any reason, and when she said it was illegal to fire someone as retaliation, HR said they would call her the next day.

However, when she went to gather the documentation again since she had given all of her original copies to HR, the place she worked had not only deleted the voicemail along with all of the emails she had in her work email, they had also gone into her personal email (that she was dumb enough to use the same password for) and deleted all of the backup documentation she had sent to herself.
