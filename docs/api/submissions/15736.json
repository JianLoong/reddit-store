I (f) have two kids Kylie (f28) and Chris (m25), both of them are married. My daughter has two kids (m5 and m2) I had helped her though both of her pregnancies as that was something she wanted. I stayed over at her and her husband's house for about a month for both pregnancies.\n\nMy son got married to a foreign girl Camila (f24), she's from latin america. They announced a couple months ago that they're expecting their first baby. Camila has no family here so we're really her only family in the country. I told her to count of me for whatever she needed with the pregnancy since I know that first pregnancies can be scary if you're alone. She thanked me and sometimes calls me to know if something's normal, or she tells me that she feels \"X\" thing and asks if she should go to the doctor and such. \n\nShe's now close to the 30 weeks now. We celebrated her baby shower last weekend with friends and family. The baby shower was held in my house, after everyone left my son, her and my daughter's family stayed over to have dinner together. I asked Camila if her mom will come to visit and help her though the delivery and postpartum weeks to which she said she wasn't going to since her mom works and it's not something that people use to do in Uruguay (her native country) because couple's trend to want some alone time after the baby's born there.\n\nI told her that sounds sad, to be all alone, I told her that here is rather common for grandma's to go and help around when a baby's born, that I did it for my daughter like my mom did it for me and etc. I told her that I could help her if she wants, I can go stay over at her house for a couple weeks before the birth so she can rest. I can cook, do laundry, clean and all those stuff so she doesn't have to. And then I can stay over after the baby is here to continue helping with the house and the baby. She told me it's not necessary since my son will have paternity leave so he can do all of those stuff. \n\nI told her that there are some stuff that he will not be able to do either (like helping with postpartum) and that they're both first time parents so both of them have a lot to learn and it's helpful to have someone who already did it around. My son agreed, he said that's true and that he won't be able to provide the same help and support that another mother can. We continued talking a bit more about that until she said its ok for me to help. They left after dinner. My daughter stayed a bit over because she wanted to talk to me. she said I was overstepping because camila was obviously very uncomfortable with me staying over and that will add stress to her. she said I'm not respecting her wishes of having alone time after the birth like she's used to. She also said I basically pressured her into telling me what I wanted to hear. Is she right about all of this? I just want to help them out", "created_utc": 1682519217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zj7zk/aita_for_pressuring_my_daughter_in_law_to_let_me/", "score": 5764, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My way better.\n\nHer: We will still do it our way.\n\nYou: Your way won't work. It won't I say. My way is superior.\n\nSon: Sure mom, your way has benefits.\n\nYou: See??? My way!! MY WAY!!!\n\nHer: Fine. Sure.\n\nDaughter: Voice of Reason.\n\nShe is 100% right. Even if you just want to help out, you were rude, insulting and badgering. What is your son to do here? Turn you down? Turn down the help?  Argue against notion that you have special experience? Complete AH. \n\nTry to LISTEN to your DIL moving forward.", "You sound pushy AND vaguely xenophobic", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is correct. When Camila responded to your query about her mom, that was your answer, esp considering she added \u201cbecause couples want some alone time after the baby is born.\u201d That was her way of saying no thank you, and you proceeded to steamroll her regardless.", "She said no, that should have been the end of it. You absolutely pressured her, and your son helped.  YTA", "YTA. You bullied your way to get what you wanted, and I hope to god that your DIL finds her spine soon and tells you to back off so her pregnancy experience isn\u2019t ruined.", "Help doesn\u2019t feel like help if you are crossing boundaries to do so. YTA.", "YTA I agree with your daughter you tried to bulldoze your way into their home after the birth of their child. A lot of new parents want time to bond with their babies one on one. You put your daughter in law on the spot and were way too pushy.", "YTA \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want you there when she\u2019s just given birth and she\u2019s made that very clear.\n\nBack off", "YTA-offering the first time is fine, but you keep pushing yourself on her. It honestly sounds somewhat disrespectful to keep harping on her needing help when she\u2019s stated her preferences. \n\nYou are not her mother. Frankly, most people would be extremely bothered by having someone in their home who isn\u2019t their direct blood relation or spouse\u2014lots of people don\u2019t feel comfortable being naked around their in-laws. If you\u2019re in her home she\u2019ll have to navigate not only having a new baby, but also work out the logistics of what she\u2019s comfortable with you doing, and communicating it so she doesn\u2019t offend you, plus constantly having to hold her boundaries when you push back (since you\u2019re not taking no for an answer now, there\u2019s no way it won\u2019t be worse if you\u2019re living there!)\n\nLet her experience motherhood the way she wants to, without having to manage your expectations as well. If they need help, they\u2019ll ask. But right now she\u2019s not only not asking, but is clearly telling you to stop offering.\n\nBack off, apologize for being pushy, and thank your daughter for pointing out the issue.", "Mild YTA. Based on your description of the conversation, it sounds like your daughter is right and you did indeed pressure your DIL into telling you what you wanted to hear. Your daughter was there during the conversation; I was not. If she says your pressured your DIL, there's a very good chance that you pressured your DIL.\n\nTime to take a step back. Tell your DIL that you will let her tell you what kind of help, if any, she wants, and when and how. Let her make those decisions. Give her the help she wants, not the help you think she needs.", "YTA. You wanting to help doesn't override the fact that SHE DOESNT WANT YOU THERE. just because your daughter was happy to have you around for two months doesn't mean your DIL should do the same.\n\nYou owe Camila an apology for over stepping and that you will provide help when she asks for it. You meant well but this isn't about you. It's about what will best make Camile comfortable in the run up to and just after giving birth.", "YTA. You are absolutely forcing yourself on her. I get you\u2019re trying to be helpful, but you should have taken her \u201cNo thank you\u201d as the end of it. They\u2019re new parents, yes. But because they are new parents, they deserve the time to get comfortable and figure things out for themselves. Just because your mom moved in with you and you moved in with your daughter doesn\u2019t mean you HAVE to do it for your son and daughter in law. \n\nIf you NEED do something, ask about bringing a meal over after they are home from the hospital. ASK FIRST. Don\u2019t just show up with a casserole. \n\nAlso. Your son can ABSOLUTELY help with postpartum stuff, if he doesn\u2019t, then that\u2019s disappointing. If you think your daughter in law being home alone with only her husband and their newborn is \u201call alone\u201d, then you need to look at the man you raised. They are a family, a unit. Let them be that while they figure things out.", "YTA.\n\nYou said your daughter WANTED your help.  Your DIL has CLEARLY said she does NOT want your help.  Even your daughter told you to back off.\n\nI think you\u2019re excited and want to be helpful.  And you can still be very helpful without staying with them.  Drop off meals, groceries, errands.  But be sure to keep your visits to a minimum or even drop off meals and don\u2019t visit.  Please don\u2019t ice them out or be frosty, they want to do things a different way and that is fine.  Her family is far, and she may need you, but if she feels you\u2019re being judgmental/frosty, she may not reach out when she needs to.  How you handle this could determine the relationship you have with your new grandchild and your son & DIL.", "YTA. It's fine to offer help, but it shouldn't be about what you want. It doesn't matter what you've done before or what you think is sad: it's her experience and her choice.", "YTA based on this you did keep pushing. Also maybe it's the way you want it done or how your family does it, but I wouldn't say it's common in the US for a mother or MIL to stay over and help out right after the birth. I have a very large extended family and never saw it happen from my grandmothers or any in-laws.\n\nIf they need you they can let you know but until then I wouldn't just plan on them being okay with you moving in for a month once they get home from the hospital.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m going to have to go light with this one but if she said no and you kept pushing for your way then that\u2019s not cool.\n\nSpeak with your son and let him make the discussion with his wife. Maybe she just said \u201cyes\u201d get you off her back but doesn\u2019t really want it? Maybe she needs it and doesn\u2019t know it? Maybe she will say no and regret it?\n\nEither way that is for the couple to decide. They are making their own traditions, not yours.", "YTA, you basically made her uncomfortable enough to eventually say yes. She probably did this because otherwise you would\u2019ve kept pushing it. I get you\u2019re trying to be helpful, but some people do prefer to do things solely with their partner.", "YTA. You could have just said it slightly differently (well if you change your mind let me know - I know I found it helpful when I had a baby) and not been as dismissive of her feelings. How far do you live? Could you stay in a hotel nearby so they have their own time with the baby? My mum helped me postpartum by bringing shopping I requested and coming in to clean when I asked her to but stayed away unless I specifically asked for help. I get on really well with my mum but I definitely wouldn't have liked someone staying in the house for weeks when I had a new baby. Plus, what postpartum things can a mother-in-law deal with better than a husband?? That just sounds sexist. There is nothing I needed my mother or mother-in-law for that my husband wouldn't have been more help with.", "YTA. The woman will ask for your help when she needs or wants it. Keep pushing and you could be shut out. Think about.", "Yes your daughter is right. It is nice from you to offer help, but the way you did it, sounds like you pressured her to take your help and do it your way. You even pulled your son but more important her husband and baby father on your side.\n\nShe has her own cultural background and knows how this things go by her family traditions. Don't try to turn this all around.\n\nI would suggest, you appologice for oversteping, and tell her, that she can call you anytime she needs help. But that you will not pressure her to let you in. So if she needs help, she can have it. But she will not feel forced to let someone in, if she is not ready", "YTA, though not a malicious one and you share blame with your son. I understand you were only trying to help. But it does sound like she felt outnumbered by you and your son and only agreed because she didn't want to keep having the argument. After making the offer, you should've stopped pushing for your position and just let her and your son decide by themselves (in private).", "YTA, you're trying to push your way of doing things when your daughter in-law has clearly said she doesn't want you around and you seemed to have lobbied your son into it too. Would have been better if you just told he she has the option if she needs it and left it at that.", "YTA a bit. Sounds like you\u2019re coming from a place of generosity and your offer is a lovely one I wish I\u2019d had when I gave birth. But that\u2019s just not what your DIL is up for right now and you should honor her wishes. That will show her you respect her as a person, not just bc she\u2019s your grand baby\u2019s mom/Son\u2019s wife\u2026and that\u2019s a great starting point for this baby and his parents\u2026and you!", "YTA\n\nShe doesn't want you there OP so back off. Obviously things work differently in her country. You are refusing to acknowledge that. \n\nLeave your DIL alone. She doesn't need your help or your company.", "YTA. I get it - you're excited about the new baby and want to show how invested and helpful you are. But, your DIL clearly doesn't want this. She said no, but felt pressured and agreed. Sure, they are both new parents, but they can figure it out just the two of them. They'll be fine (and exhausted, like new parents everywhere!) \n\nSuggested fix: Call your DIL and say, I think in my excitement about the birth of the new baby, I may have been a bit pushy. So, as of this moment, I am not planning on coming to stay with you and the new baby. That being said, I am still available if you want me to. Just reach out and I'll be there.\n\nCongrats on the new grandbaby!", "I understand that from your perspective your offer seems really reasonable and generous and it doesn\u2019t make sense why someone would turn it down, this is a big moment in someone\u2019s life and you just want to help. But \u201chelping\u201d somebody is only actually beneficial when they actually want/need it. Plenty of parents make it through this time without a grandparent living in the house or assisting at all. If that is what she wants (or what she thinks she wants, maybe after the baby is born she might\u2019ve decided she wanted help), she is allowed to feel that way, and it\u2019s not appropriate for you to tell her whether the way she feels is right. Some people prefer to figure things out on their own, and need that space. \n  \nContinuing to argue against someone\u2019s refusal of your help or explain why you think their perspective is wrong is pressuring them to agree. What was her other option? Escalate the conflict? Leave abruptly and cause a scene? You didn\u2019t actually change her mind, you just wore her down. And you shouldn\u2019t try to change her mind. You can hope that she eventually comes to that conclusion on her own, but this is her baby and her experience. \n  \n\nYou have to let her and your son, but especially her because your relationship with her is different and newer, set the boundaries for how you are involved in their parenting. They will be grateful for whatever they need from you that you provide, so long as you respect their boundaries about what they actually need. Insisting that you be involved without them wanting you to be there will only hurt your relationship with them, and your presence will be in their minds as the reason their new parent experience was stressful. \n  \nYou should privately apologize to her for steamrolling and not respecting her perspective. Tell her your offer to help however *she* needs it still stands if she ever wants it, but that you will not involve yourself without her asking. And then actually do that. If not, YTA, sorry.", "YTA. You asked. She said no. You kept pushing. She's not your daughter and her culture is different. Adjust your expectations.", "YTA. You offered, that's fine. But she said no and then you continued to try and talk her into it and didn't stop until she relented. That *is* pressuring.", "YTA - Unless your daughter has some ulterior motive for wanting to keep you away from your DIL, I think you need to take her word for it that you were pressuring DIL into this. \n\nIt also sounds like you are completely undermining your son's role as the father and his ability to parent his own child. Yes, both of them are first time parents - but he is her partner and that baby's parent. He might need advice on how to support his wife after she gives birth, but anything you can do for her, he can do for her. \n\nYou should be encouraging your son to be a full and active parent and a supportive partner, not reinforcing the stereotype that fathers are less capable parents.", "Sorry but YTA\n\nYou meant good, still it was pressuring and might have made your daughter-in-law uncomfortable", "YTA   Ditto others\u2019 reasons.  I don\u2019t have kids, but 4 sisters, several nieces and tons of friends with kids and grandchildren.  I don\u2019t know of anyone who needed live-in help for their first child.", "Yeah, YTA. Your intentions were good, but she very obviously does not want you there and now feels like she's not allowed to say no. \n\nCall her, apologise and let her know that you didn't pick up on her discomfort, but it has been explained to you now and you will stay home unless she explicitly asks you to come. Let her know that she's in control, and you'll provide whatever help she needs and only the help she needs.", "You are now EXTENDED Family and need to respect the boundaries of other adults.  If/when your DIL decides she needs help, she will be the one to ask.  Do NOT pressure her to do what YOU WANT!", "YTA. This type of insisting on getting your way (AND having your son support you over his own wife) is one way of completely destroying any type of relationship with your daughter in law. Keep it up and we'll see you in another sub whining about why your DIL keeps the grandkids away from you.", "Mild YTA you are overstepping her boundaries and the way she likes to do thkngs because you think it is better to have someone elsed in your house. I for instance found it insane to have my MIL helping around the house in a moment of full stress. Like ..i would only want to be with my husband and my baby. That is it. You should tell her that she cant tell you if she needs help and that you will be happy to...but dont be overbearing. Besides this is also something cultural it seems.", "YTA-You mean well but she\u2019s clearly stated that she doesn\u2019t want the extra help you\u2019ll provide and instead of accepting that you disagreed and told her what your son, her husband will not be able to do for her.", "Info: what exactly are you claiming your son can't help with, and why can't he help with it?", "YTA\n\nRespect her decision. Some people love to have always people around, others prefer to be \"alone\". She won't be alone, she will be with the father. \n\nThey are starting together a new family, a new adventure, they are both adults capable of making their own decisions as a couple and now as a family. And it looks like she thanks and value your help, calling and talking about the baby, but it's more like a privacy and not dealing with the background noise and crowding once the baby is born", "I know you think you're helping, but you're coming off as very \"mother knows best\" and YTA for it.\n\nWhen she said she didn't want your help you *badgered* her into it. You've now convinced your son that the things he *should* be responsible for are \"women's work\". The only thing you have to offer in the first few weeks is experience, and that can be provided over the phone. If they want more they can ask for it.\n\nYour DIL will be vulnerable, but more than that, she wants to build her new family. Becoming a mother on her own terms. She's been imagining her time, getting to know their new little one, forming the family with the three of them. And now you're going to be right in the middle of it.\n\nDon't do it. Don't go an insert yourself. Talk to your DIL. Let her know that you support her and you'll be there the moment she or her husband ask for help, but that you won't come unless you're called for. Don't be another stressor in her life at the moment.", "Soft YTA.", "Slightly YTA. I know you were truly trying to be helpful but I think you need to ask your son to talk to his wife in private about if she really wants you there or not.", "Very soft YTA. Your heart is in the right place, and you were only trying to help. But it\u2019s clear that your daughter-in-law was uncomfortable with the idea of you staying over after she gives birth and would really like to be alone with her husband and new baby for a bit. This is normal for many people, including many families in the U.S. Telling her it \u201csounds sad\u201d was just your opinion, and it wasn\u2019t asked for (it came off as kind of rude). The entire reason many families do this is so parents and baby can bond and learn to function healthily as a new family unit. \n\nAlso, why are you saying your son won\u2019t be able to help? He\u2019s the father, and he absolutely should be helping in any way he can. Saying he won\u2019t be able to and letting him believe it is just setting him up for failure as both a father and a husband.\n\nYou can still make it clear that you\u2019re available to help, but don\u2019t force your way in\u2014 especially not right after she\u2019s given birth.", "Very gentle YTA. I can tell your heart is in the right place, but now it\u2019s time to realize DIL is the mom and these are her decisions to make. Even though you\u2019ve had your own kids and helped your daughter with hers, that does not automatically make you the authority on parenting. She is the authority on parenting her baby, her choices come first, she says what is best - Not grandma. Your role is to be supportive in whatever way she wants you to, not force her to change her wants so they align with yours because \u201cyou know better\u201d. Work on this. It could really damage your relationship in the future.", "YTA. Everyone handles birth differently and you basically told her that the way people in her culture manage it is \"sad\". Some people prefer to be alone after birth, while others welcome some help - it's a very personal decision. You did basically pressure her into saying what you wanted instead of respecting her polite response about it not being necessary. You should apologize for this while making clear that you're willing to offer whatever type of support is best for her.", "YTA, your daughter is right. The worst of what you did was to get your son to agree with you that he is not as qualified as you are because he is not another mother. I can only imagine how your DIL felt\u2014her heart must have sunk at the thought that she is about to have a baby with a momma's boy. So do the right thing. Apologize, back off, and don't make excuses for why your son is not competent enough to do what his wife has every right to expect of him.", "Yea your daughter is right. In this instance, YTA. It's a shame your son didn't stand up for his wife here.", "YTA.  So is your son.  The both of you need to work on your listening skills and trust Camila.  If I were her friend, I'd be pulling her aside and making sure she was taking notes of the massive red flags that both you and her husband are throwing.  She told y'all she's got this, so she's got this.  There's also no reason why her husband can't help with postpartum.  If I were Camila I would be very concerned about how quickly my husband tossed me to his mother when I clearly said he can help.", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA \n\nYou\u2019re sweet to offer support, but that\u2019s it. Offer. Back off now and let her speak up if she wants anything. You are being pushy and cranky I don\u2019t like the way you talk about her being \u201cforeign.\u201d", "YTA. It\u2019s very presumptuous to assume that your DIL would be comfortable with you helping her with postpartum stuff. \n\nYour DIL pretty clearly told you twice that she is not interested in the level of help you were offering, and instead of showing her respect, you insulted her culture, and kept pushing. \n\nIf you have any interest in having a good relationship with your DIL moving forward, you should listen to your daughter, apologize, and start respecting her as a parent instead of pushing what you want/think is right.", "Seriously?! YTA - massively.\n\nShe was politely telling you to back off. She even made mention of the fact that in her culture, the parents like to bond with the baby.\n\nAnd I\u2019m confused about what kind of help you\u2019re planning to provide your daughter-in-law postpartum? Who wants their mother-in-law to see their mesh underwear?\n\nI didn\u2019t want my mom to stay with me. \nI didn\u2019t want my mother-in-law to stay with me. \nFor either one of my pregnancies. \n\nI wanted to figure it out on my own and have the embarrassing moments without an audience. It hurt my mom\u2019s feelings I think honestly, but I\u2019m so grateful she just backed the fuck off and let me figure it out.\n\nI was pressured by my husband to have my mother-in-law come for our second kid and it was shitty. Thankfully, she ended up only staying for two days instead of a week. \n\nAnd I love my mother-in-law it\u2019s not a slight.\n\nApologize. For real.", "Can I suggest just being ready at the drop of a hat to dash over? Maybe right now she doesn't think she needs the help. But when it's actually happening she might want it. I'd just reinforce you're ready to give them space or jump in if needed.", "NAH yet. I think you mean well, but some people are more private. You don't want to wear out your welcome and/or make things more stressful for them. I think you are ok to offer, but not push. Just remind her that you would love to help, but only if she would like you to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I (f) have two kids Kylie (f28) and Chris (m25), both of them are married. My daughter has two kids (m5 and m2) I had helped her though both of her pregnancies as that was something she wanted. I stayed over at her and her husband's house for about a month for both pregnancies.\n\nMy son got married to a foreign girl Camila (f24), she's from latin america. They announced a couple months ago that they're expecting their first baby. Camila has no family here so we're really her only family in the country. I told her to count of me for whatever she needed with the pregnancy since I know that first pregnancies can be scary if you're alone. She thanked me and sometimes calls me to know if something's normal, or she tells me that she feels \"X\" thing and asks if she should go to the doctor and such. \n\nShe's now close to the 30 weeks now. We celebrated her baby shower last weekend with friends and family. The baby shower was held in my house, after everyone left my son, her and my daughter's family stayed over to have dinner together. I asked Camila if her mom will come to visit and help her though the delivery and postpartum weeks to which she said she wasn't going to since her mom works and it's not something that people use to do in Uruguay (her native country) because couple's trend to want some alone time after the baby's born there.\n\nI told her that sounds sad, to be all alone, I told her that here is rather common for grandma's to go and help around when a baby's born, that I did it for my daughter like my mom did it for me and etc. I told her that I could help her if she wants, I can go stay over at her house for a couple weeks before the birth so she can rest. I can cook, do laundry, clean and all those stuff so she doesn't have to. And then I can stay over after the baby is here to continue helping with the house and the baby. She told me it's not necessary since my son will have paternity leave so he can do all of those stuff. \n\nI told her that there are some stuff that he will not be able to do either (like helping with postpartum) and that they're both first time parents so both of them have a lot to learn and it's helpful to have someone who already did it around. My son agreed, he said that's true and that he won't be able to provide the same help and support that another mother can. We continued talking a bit more about that until she said its ok for me to help. They left after dinner. My daughter stayed a bit over because she wanted to talk to me. she said I was overstepping because camila was obviously very uncomfortable with me staying over and that will add stress to her. she said I'm not respecting her wishes of having alone time after the birth like she's used to.

We understand she doesn't have any bad intentions while doing it but we still feel very stressed because we don't like people coming to our home without notice. My point here is that even if you have the best intentions you still need to listen to what your DIL is comfortable with. If you don't correct this she will build resentment towards you. You should apologize and tell her you will stay home but you're only a phone call away if they should change their minds. Otherwise, YTA.", "Im from the deep south and have had 2 c sections.

Wtf? Respect her own traditions, they had a plan...if they don't ask, dont mess with it.", "I am really glad you asked....... YTA, clearly.", "YTA.", "YTA. For 3 reasons:\n\n1- She made her wishes clear and you ignored them because you thought your way was better. \n2 - You referred to her as a 'foreign girl'. There was no need to indicate she was from Latin America. The story would have been the same. if you had just said 'Daughter in law says they do things differently in her family'.\n3- You said there are things her husband won't be able to help with, putting (postpartum) in brackets. There is *nothing* her husband can't help her with. My husband was helping me clean the postpartum bleeding from our sofa. He helped me wit the ice popsicles I had to put in my pants to soothe the pain from the stitches. I asked him to check thee stitches often because I was afraid of infection. Sure, these are all things men may not want to do, or that women may be uncomfortable with letting their partners do. But this is nothing they *can't* do. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou not only over stepped, you steam rolled that poor girl.\n\nAlso, if your son is unable to help care for her physical and emotional needs after giving birth, you absolutely failed at raising your son to be a capable husband. You should have nothing to do with raising more children if failure is acceptable.", "YTA apologize and tell her: you are here if she needs it.\nBut no pressure", "YTA. Stop telling her things and LISTEN.", "YTA. \n\nIt was great that you offered, but then you needed to stop. You also seem to have a lack of understanding of how different people might have boundaries. \n\nFirst, there isn't a right way to help out new parents. They can go it alone, or move people in, or hire people, or bring in an entire village. As long as the parents like their plan, that is what matters. \n\nSecond, why can't your son do everything after the birth? You are not more qualified than him to handle the \"postpartum\" of his wife. He can be an emotional support to her as her chosen partner, he certainly will be able to notice mood changes more than you would, and she trusts him more to talk to. Your son is certainly capable of doing all the things needed in bringing home a new child. \n\nThird, it is actually pretty icky that your son agreed with you. Of course he wants you to come over and help because now he gets to do less. And now of course his wife had to agree because you both ganged up on her and her own husband made it clear he didn't think he was \"qualified\" to help. Which by the way, means the two of you have now planted the seeds in her head that her own partner can't step up to do the parenting and support required of...having a kid. \n\nFinally, the comfort of the mother is the most important thing here. She doesn't want help, end of story, and if that changes she now knows she can ask. Next is the comfort of your son (the mother does matter more here, mildly, because she is the one going through the medical stuff), and if the two of them end up struggling, they can reach out to you. \n\nSo if you truly don't want to be overbearing and an AH MIL, you will simply not follow up on staying over with them. You will just be quiet for a few weeks, and then do normal check ins as if this conversation never happened. You won't make a big deal out of it, you won't have a dramatic \"fine, I guess you don't want me around\" you will simply exist as a helpful mother and check on them, ask if they need anything, bring over some snacks- with permission- and drop it.", "\u2018Foreign girl\u2019. I\u2019d basically made up my mind there, but reading on just cemented it. YTA", "YTA. You aren't her mother. And for you to keep pushing until she said ok was being very overbearing.

Maybe unintentionally but still YTA\n\nHelp that's not wanted is not help. \n\nMake the offer, don't push, then wait to be asked. \n\nEven if she does wind up needing your assistance, it's a much easier pill to swallow something that was offered once and not insisted upon vs something that was shoved down my throat. \n\nTake a step back, apologize to your dil for your overstep and tell her you'll still be available whenever she needs you but you're not going to impose yourself.\n\nAlso, take in consideration what you are doing to your son's marriage. How would you feel if you were having a disagreement and your mil brought your husband into it and your husbanded sided with his mom in front of everyone? I'd be livid at my husband.", "YTA.  Your way of thinking is VERY flawed.  What you described is one way to do things, but not THE way.  I'm sure some women love and appreciate the help, but you talk as if it's the majority of women.  Myself, along with almost every single family/friend wanted time alone after baby was born.  And the very last thing we all wanted was our MIL at our home for multiple weeks at a time.  \n\nI love my MIL.  She is an amazing woman and I have zero doubt she'd be a great source of comfort and help, but there is no way on this green earth I'd willingly ask her to stay at my house for a few weeks after the birth of my first child.  As if there isn't enough emotions, exhaustion, hormones flying around....that would just make my anxiety sky rocket.  I married a very capable man who is my rock, and I am his.  We'd survive just fine.    \n\n\nI also have zero doubt you'd also be an amazing source of help, but to get to that level of trust with your DIL, you must first respect her boundaries.  Respect those boundaries lovingly, and you could very possibly become the MIL all women dream of having.", "YTA.

I can't describe the guttural need to pack my things at my parents' and to finally go home with baby and husband after we got discharged days later. I didn't want to be around anyone. I was in pain and discomfort while riding the high of being a parent with my husband for the first time.\nI could not have enjoyed or appreciated guests or live-in parental figures - especially if they had a history of not respecting my preferences and boundaries during pregnancy.\nOP you may mean well but your insistence on doing things your way is concerning and will negatively impact your relationship with your son and DIL", "I think you meant well and want to help, which is kind, but it\u2019s time to back off now.\n\nPost-partum help is very much an individual preference.

Some friends of mine didn't let anyone see the baby for a literal month. THIS IS NORMAL for many. Just because Americans do it different doesn't mean the other way is \"sad\". I have literally never heard a Swedish person say they wished they had a bunch of random ppl in their house a day after delivery.

I love my mother but wouldn\u2019t want her or definitely not my MIL helping with the Uber personal things having to do with my lady parts. Ick. Lady needs to learn boundaries.", "Very true", "Both my sisters and my best friend did exactly the same thing.  Among my friends, it\u2019s more common than not to request no overnight guests or more than short planned visits to drop off casseroles for the first few weeks, while the new family settles in, recovers, and figures out their own routine (plus, OP going on about how they have a lot to learn, as if they need her to teach them how to parent the baby, was a massive red flag)!", "I love the part where OP told them as first time parents they have a lot to learn!  As though to say they need her there to teach them how to parent their baby.  Which suggests a lot of entitlement and is a red flag that she will try to micromanage their parenting, especially Camila\u2019s.  Yes, first time parents have a lot to learn, or rather to figure out, for themselves.  They need to settle in together and figure out how they want to do things, and the best way to manage things for their family, which may not be the way OP would manage things.", "\ud83e\udd23 so true.", "This so much! I live three hours away by plane from my parents and in-laws and they ALL came to stay in our small home for a month after my first baby!\n\nThey wanted to help, but required me to micromanage everything (\u201cHow small should I chop these carrots? Is this right? Can you check?\u201d) and my husband went into hospitable host mode and checked out of tending to me and bub. I was so relieved when they all left!", "Even something hands-off, like \"Give me a list of your favorite dishes, I'll drop off meals on the doorstep every day the first week.  I'll text to let you know it's there, no point in risking waking the baby with the doorbell.\"", "It's not impossible. Because the point of that conversation wasn't to debate whether OP knows more about being a mom.\n\nOP wanted to come over and \"help\" with the baby. His wife already said no a bunch of times. OP  **wasn't listening** and kept coming up with new arguments for why she should get to help.\n\nIf someone isn't listening to you then why should you put in the effort needed to fully respond to each of their arguments? \n\n\"No thanks mom. We'll be fine mom. I know mom, but we'll be OK. We're good mom. We'll figure it out mom.\"\n\nIt's *his* mom. *He's* the main reason his wife has to deal with OP. *He* should be taking it up on himself to say no 1 million times when she's like this. Sitting on the sidelines and agreeing with OP's points is a dick move.", "I know many Americans prefer to have alone time at home right after the baby.  Many even insist visits be delayed for a month or two after the birth to allow the family to settle in.  Both my sisters chose to be alone with their husbands and babies after birth, and my mom and I would do planned visits for a couple hours where we would bring food for them and maybe fold some laundry, wash some dishes, change a diaper, or watch baby long enough so they could grab showers.  But neither wanted even our own mother to come stay with them.  So, OP is just not correct about that.", "My grandmother came with my younger siblings\u2019 births to care for us and the house for the first week or so.  New baby was mom\u2019s sole responsibility unless she asked for help - she didn\u2019t have to get up to send us off to school or worry about making dinner or anything like that.  And it helped us not feel left out, since grandma was very much a party as far as we were concerned.  But grandma was also great about heading to her room as soon as the dinner dishes were done and giving us some family time - and no doubt she really enjoyed the break!", "This would be an absolute non-starter with both/either mother or MIL for me. If I need my hoohah inspected that is quite literally my intimate partner\u2019s job.", "Some people just don\u2019t get this. Even my own husband was confused on why I was okay with my mom staying with us postpartum but not his mom. Uh, because I\u2019m okay with my mother, the woman who birthed me, seeing me with my boobs out breastfeeding or being around me when I haven\u2019t showered in days. I don\u2019t feel that way about *your* mom.", "It really is. Every post makes me appreciate my MIL even more. She's warm and loving and respects all boundaries - even regarding religion which is something a lot of people struggle with because even non-judgemental religious types will often try to convert you because they're honestly worried about your soul.", "My wife, who is really attached to her mom, told her no visiting for two weeks. I was shocked. Then after her mom, her dad and stepmother came. They arrived on the day we found out my son needed surgery, but had to stabilize over night before it could be done. He was 4 weeks old exactly on the day he had surgery. Her dad acted like a guest who expected to be taken care of rather than step up to the moment and support his daughter.", "No. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen in a long life dealing with women like this for many, many years. She may be the exception but this is who these women are the vast majority of the time. Even her own daughter had to tell her to back off.", "YTA.  She\u2019s not your daughter and you\u2019re being pushy, conceited and condescending", "YTA for all the reasons everyone else has mentioned\u2026.You\u2019re being very pushy and insufferable\u2026 You need to respect boundaries", "YTA. After baby is born make sure you check out r/JNMIL. You\u2019ll probably be featured there if you keep this up.", "YTA\n\nHas anyone told you that \n\n1) It's not your pregnancy\n\n2) Not everyone suffers from post partum depression (which is what I guess you are alluding to.) It affects 1 in 10 women. And since you aren't a doctor or someone she wants around you shouldn't force yourself into her situation. \n\n3) Stop trying to raise her kid.", "And I'm sure the 'told you so' is ready and waiting in the arsenal too", "It really annoys me she said her son couldn't do certain things like helping with post partum. What are you going to do, lady? Change her pads? Wipe for her? Because I can't think of anything else he couldn't help with. YTA and you're a huge asshole for telling your son he's not capable of helping his partner. Boo", "My big hangup is that she said there are things her son isn't able to do, like \"helping with postpartum,\" whatever that means. If what she says is true, why did she raise a man incapable of being able to learn?", "There has not been a more perfect reply in this sub for a good while. OP YTA, and son too for not backing his wife. (Perhaps pressure is a tool OP has used in her household before?)", "I\u2019m Canadian and also find it strange to read of having so many visitors in the hospital in the US. I always thought our cultures were so similar but when I was pregnant I joined online mom groups and was shocked by stories from American moms of people coming to the hospital when mom went in labour, people feeling entitled to attend the birth (!!) and everyone and their dog visiting after the birth. Totally foreign to me. This is a hospital, not a social club, I would be horrified if people tried to push themselves into such a private thing for my husband and I. Nobody even asked because that\u2019s just not something that is done here unless the pregnant woman specifically requests it. \n\nAnd also yes ditto with not wanting anyone staying at my home after. I don\u2019t know anyone who has done this unless there was some illness or complication. It\u2019s fine to make the offer to a new mom, but pushing it and acting like it was necessary is where OP rubs me the wrong way. \n\nPersonally I didn\u2019t even allow extended family or friends to visit until 3 weeks later, which they all understood and respected because I just had a baby (and also recovering from a c section). Anyone outside of immediate family met the baby at the baby shower 3.5 weeks later, although since covid it\u2019s become more popular to have the American-style baby shower where you do it before the baby is born.\n\nNew moms deserve whatever space they want, pressuring them in any way to attend the hospital or stay at their home when they have already expressed not wanting that is major asshole territory to me. It\u2019s the opposite of helping or being supportive.", "Exactly.\n\n>I told her that there are some stuff that he will not be able to do either (like helping with postpartum)\n\nUh...... but why not? Is he suddenly allergic to her body until he can stick his dick in it again? The only thing he won't be able to do for her is breastfeed.", "The 'you both have a lot to learn' comment sent me - this lady can't even learn social cues.", "Actually, tell her your offer to help was exactly that \u2026 an offer, that she was free to decline, and apologize for not respecting her refusal the first time.  Then, ask her what, if any, support from you she would like or appreciate.  It may be to bring a meal or two over or to run to the store when she needs it.  It may be nothing.  Then agree to do that and let her know that the offer for assistance remains open if she requests more assistance when the time comes.  And then stick to that and do only what she is asking of you.", "It\u2019s not an impossible spot at all. That\u2019s not what his wife wants. Period! It\u2019s that simple. The son hasn\u2019t even been put in the position yet to see how it will all play out. The MIL could\u2019ve just left the invitation open \u201c if you need my help, I\u2019m just a phone call away\u201d instead of making it seem like it\u2019s so impossible for them to do it on their own. \nHonestly with her pushy attitude it sounds like if she were there she would be imposing more of her opinions as far as what the DIL should do.", "When our grandchildren were born ( twins), we contributed to paying for a baby nurse to help them out and get them on a sleeping schedule. We would help out some and visit frequently, but we didn\u2019t take over. I think it worked out better that way. My DIL had her mother not that far away, as well as other family members and friends, who were quite adept at taking over. I was happiest when our visits didn\u2019t coincide. NTA for offering help but OP needed not to push so hard after that.", "My mom was an RN and I would have been uncomfortable with her examining me.", "Often they're stuck on thinking it's about equal time with the baby when it has nothing to do with the baby. You can take care of the baby. Who is taking care of you?\n\nThe fact this op is pressuring everyone to allow access to her dils vagina is horrifying.", "THIS!!!!!!!!!", "I don't know if you blog, but you should. \ud83d\ude05", "Yeah no doubt. And saying that there are aspects of post partum care that the mom can handle that the husband can\u2019t? What??? He put the baby in her, he\u2019ll presumably be at the hospital to watch her give birth, so what exactly is going to be happening when she\u2019s at home that he won\u2019t be able to help with? More than anything, he\u2019ll be helping her by bringing her things/letting her rest. What\u2019s MIL going to do, hold the fucking peri bottle for her DIL? Lmfao. Such an old fashioned sentiment, and so damaging to assume that men are incapable of helping their wives postpartum.", "I said \u2026 \n\nI said \u2026\n\nI said \u2026 \n\nI said \u2026 \n\nShe said OK.", "I would suggest \"I'm sorry, I kept thinking about our conversation... And I was so worried about not accepting my help because you didn't want to be a bother that I didn't realize I kept trying to help with what I believe you need instead of what you actually need. So, how can I help? Giving you space IS an option, whatever you need\"\n\nYTA. \n\nKeep in mind that I did have my mother nearby and helping, but I wouldn't have wanted her living with us. I truly love my MIL, she's the best. That said, our relationship wasn't close enough for me to feel relaxed and comfortable with her in our house for extended periods of time, she simply didn't know MY systems, moods or traditions.\nShe respected our needs over her wants and has now stayed overnights for visits and is always welcome.", "> What is your son to do here?\n\nTurn her down.\n\n> Turn you down?\n\nYes.\n\n> Turn down the help?\n\nYes.\n\n> Argue against notion that you have special experience?\n\nNo. But turn her down anyway.\n\n>Complete AH. \n\nAgreed.", "This is so accurate", "Oh, OP would definitely be interfering and overbearing.  I got that from her saying they would have a lot to learn.  Ummm, they will have a lot to figure out and decide the right way for them, but they don\u2019t need granny there trying to micromanage their parenting.  Not to mention, a lot of these grandmothers followed parenting ideas and techniques that are now discredited and aren\u2019t recommended.  The fact that you had babies over 20 years ago doesn\u2019t mean you are a guru!", "Oh good! Maybe she could make her a postpartum care package too, I bet that gesture would go a long way. And leave the door open if DIL has questions or does need help.", "I would MUCH much rather have my husband help me pee or shower than I would my MIL, or even my own Mom. I'm a bit weird about physical touch and vulnerability and I'm by far the most used to my husband helping/touching me.", "I stopped reading after that, it was all the information I needed", "I think I\u2019d cry having my own mother do it. I\u2019d want to crawl in a hole and die if my MIL was the one doing that. Nah, the one who helped make the baby and that situation can help me clean my vag while it\u2019s healing. \ud83d\ude02 If he doesn\u2019t want to do that, ain\u2019t no baby coming out of there.", "Exactly, I didn't need help from anyone in that area \ud83d\ude43", "I'm 38, but same, 3 kids. No help on any day. I didn't want any, I can't imagine having someone in my space while I'm learning about my new baby. If I'd had a c-section, maybe. If I was somehow unable to do things, maybe. But other than that, it was honestly normal housework whenever we felt like because who cares, husband cooked dinner, and we otherwise slept and enjoyed our baby. A third person \"helping\" would have been the most unhelpful, intrusive thing at that time.", "My MIL showed up two days after my daughter was born,  along with her two 20+ sons and granddaughter. She cooked a total of one meal, complained my week old daughter was spoiled and kept turning off the air conditioner. I feel like if my daughter or future DIL want me there after they give birth, then they can ask. In no way do i want them to feel pressured.", "Wouldn\u2019t even have to finish the sentence, it will always be my mom I\u2019d want helping me with stuff like that. She gave birth to me for crying out loud, the woman has seen everything and seen it all at every stage of my life.", "Touche", "Omg. I\u2019d jump out the window if my MIL spent WEEKS at my house before and after birth. \ud83e\udee0", "Right?! Also like, Latin America isn't even... that wildly foreign, let's be real here. I mean, I guess if you live in like, Idaho.", "I'm a white American and immediately cringed at \"foreign girl.\" You have even more reason to react negatively based on personal experience, but that has no bearing on whether or not OP is racist or xenophobic. (Which she is, along with being a garden-variety AH on top of it.)", "My mother in law IS a trained OBGYN and she is not coming anywhere near my personal bits!", "And I can say from (eye witness) experience when grandma move in it doesn\u2019t always end up so \u201chelpful\u201d. \n\nMy mom stayed with my sister for a few weeks before my nephew was born and stayed until about a month after, when my sister got so tired of her she chewed her out and my mother left in a huff.\n\nNo offense to OP, but being this type of pushy MIL builds resentment. Either the DIL will smother it but always feel uncomfortable, or it would come to a verbal sparring match. \n\nWhy not wait until she reaches out and asks for help?", "Wait until you find out Chinese people will call you 'foreign person' even if you aren't in China. I don't see the problem personally.", "Pretty sure she wouldn't be allowed anyway because family can't treat family, not officially anyway. Too much room for under the table stuff, and also family is too personal and doctors need an element of detachment from their patients to be able to properly diagnose and treat.\n\nLike I can ask my sisters what they think of xyz, but they aren't allowed to fix my teeth or actually cut me open. Although I get lots of unsolicited health advice regarding my personal vices. Bloody dentists and their war on sugar \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8"]}
