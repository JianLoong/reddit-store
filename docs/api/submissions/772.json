It's none of their business unless you make it their business. You're free to sleep with, date, and do whatever you want, because You. Are. An. ADULT.", "NTA.  Tell them plainly that your personal life is yours and not theirs to share.  They had the opportunity to have these conversations years ago and lost out.", "NTA because your parents are wayyyyy too involved with their adult offspring's life. But in the future it's easier not to lie, even as an experiment to learn their reactions. If you go back now and say \"none of that is true, I was just so annoyed by your inappropriate meddling,\" you will sound less trustworthy than you actually are.", "Having been through this exact same thing, I left when I was 18 and never spoke to them again. It does not get any better if you maintain a relationship, they don't respect you, or your boundaries. No one will be good enough and they will try to berate you and every single person you are interested in.\n\nTrust me.\n\nYou need to find your own way in life, it's hard, I know. The way you've been brought up makes you fear everything. You'll get there honey, but allowing your parents to continue to abuse you won't help you find your true independence.", "NTA. this is not overprotection, this is straight abuse. they deserve that lie. It should keep them awake and stressed for knowing they no longer can control and abuse you. Sometimes the best solution is to cut the bs out of your life and go NC with them. Ask yourself if you can continue doing this for the next twenty years being under them? And don\u2019t let them fool you that this is love or their way how they can show their love to you, it is not. This is abuse and your mental health will take any longer if you keep this up. Stay away from them and be safe as they may turn physically abusive and threaten you. Move out somewhere else and cut contact.\n\n(QUESTION: are you Arab/Muslim? is it culture or it\u2019s just them)\n\nNTA.", "NTA. However you want to create distance with them is fine. If you do it by lying to make them back off, so be it. Your parents have a very unhealthy attachment to you and are trying to maintain control over you even though you're a grown adult. I'm glad you've moved out and are living your own life!", "NTA\n\nlook as an adult i should say 'lying is almost never the right answer blah blah' but\n\n1. you were damned either way and \n2. frankly your parents deserved it\n\nwas what you did the \\*most\\* healthy/mature thing? probably not. But honestly? after what you've described, you deserve to be a little immature. Your parents may have had good intentions but they were MAJOR AHs. They clearly cannot handle that you are an adult, with your own life and desires and goals. \n\nThat they would frame you as \"betraying\" them for not talking about your (non existent) relationships is super AH-ish of them, since its pretty clear if the relationships had been real, and you had told them, they would have punished you severely for that too. \n\nI'm sorry OP, your parents probably aren't necessarily bad people, but they ARE bad parents. A parent is supposed to educate, support, and help their kids prepare for being an adult. It sounds like you did that all on your own, so give yourself a hug. \n\nit is wild to me in this day and age you still have grown ass adults acting like sex\\*\\*\\* is \\~bad. So what if you \\*had\\* been f\\*\\*\\*ing around? you apparently graduated, had a career, seem to have made reasonable choices, do you know how many parents would be SO thrilled to have you as a kid? \n\n\\*\\*\\* sex between consenting adults", "NTA. It would have been better for you not to lie, but your parents are way too overprotective. I think you need a good deal of separation from them.", "NTA.  I laughed. You went straight for the right answer the first time. Excellent! Saved all us from posting same advice. You rock", "Probably shouldn\u2019t lie if you want to have a relationship with them in the future, but NTA. Those people did a number on you and I suggest you find a good therapist. And for the love of everything wholly in this world please do not fall in love with and marry the first man to show you some attention. Predators can sense an inexperienced young woman who\u2019s having issues with her parents.", "NTA, but good heavens, keep these people at arm's length.  They're entirely too overbearing.", "I\u2019m just gonna say ESH. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have lied to your parents about supposedly dating and having relationships when you didn\u2019t. Especially since I really doubt they would believe you if you decided to be honest about it later.\n\nBut I can understand why you did it, especially given their reaction to the lie. It\u2019s an A-hole move, but not unwarranted. Expressing feelings of betrayal is not a healthy response to finding out their 25 year-old is supposedly sexually active. And their attempts at inserting themselves in your sex life and giving unsolicited opinions on it is invasive at best, emotionally abusive at worst. I would also take a guess that neither of them would be accepting of any boundaries you set in place regarding information about your life either, so there\u2019s so surprise that you limited your contact with them.\n\nAt this point, I would recommend working through your reaction and theirs in therapy, and give yourself the time you need to work through the emotional complexities that come with, and are associated with this situation. And I would also recommend you actually talk to your parents, that is, if you want to have further contact. Express how you felt uncomfortable talking to them about the topic in the first place, and that while it was not your intention to mislead them, remind them that you needed the space to independently mature and reach your own perspectives on the topic before discussing it with them. \n\nBeyond that, keep your distance. Their attempts to influence you through guilt-tripping and shaming is blatant emotional manipulation, and it\u2019s an outright attempt at getting you to remain in conformity to their strict standards.", "NTA. It's never good to lie because of unintended consequences, but totally understandable in this situation, so at some point you may want to correct the truth. parent relationships are tough.", "NTA, I understood why you said it.. but I have to ask: what's your plan going forward? Are you going to cut your parents off, are you going to take some distance, are you going to rub it in their faces somwhat more?\n\nThose questions are not a moral judgement from me btw. Enjoy their reactions: that's what I'd do. But you can't really take this back or make them treat you like before, if you still want a relationship with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
