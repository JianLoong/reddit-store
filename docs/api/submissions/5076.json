AITA?\n\nEdit to add: Okay, I sincerely understand those who are calling me an asshole but seriously, look at it from my perspective. My uncle has been putting me down for YEARS and making cruel comments, pretending to be straight to fit in with his stupid heteronormative family and making my family life hell, but when I catch him sticking his tongue out at a guy I'm supposed to have a friendly chat and explain to him how nice it is to be gay and support him coming out to my family?

That in NO WAY exonerates him, but realize that his homophobia that you hear directed at you, I guarantee you, it's a thousand times harsher and louder in his own head directed at HIMSELF.

To out somebody that way is just wrong.  Your uncle had to hide who he truly is his whole life to your family. You forget that generation was completely different back then.  I know I am part of that generation.  You risked your job, life, family basically everything if you were gay.  It was safer to be \" normal.\"  You should have talked to your uncle to see why he hides his identity. I bet you would he really surprised at his answer.  My BF was  a gay male he committed suicide at age 18 because he was shunned so badly by his family & school was a nightmare for him. I was his only friend & couldn't protect him enough.
