She was asleep she later told me. We continued to hang out as I thought maybe it was a one off thing. \n\nShe invited me to a preseason football game (she had free tickets) and canceled morning of bc she got in a fight with her husband.

I ordered extra food and made a cute gift bag for her daughter. She didn\u2019t show. I had to text her an hour into the party to find out if she was coming and she said no her daughter was sick. \n\nI have limited our relationship after this and hadn\u2019t seen her in months. Today she reached out to get coffee. I told her a time. We agreed. I had my daughter with me. I waited 30 minutes. My daughter stared crying and I left.

You know that saying, \u201cFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me\u201d? Why the heck would you keep hinging things and getting your daughter\u2019s hopes up dependent on your friend miraculously attending?\n\nIf you were invested in this relationship, then it would be trivial to start reaching out earlier to be sure. Instead of waiting one hour after the event was supposed to start, call them one hour before to check if they\u2019re still going to follow through.\n\nThat would also be a good opportunity to remind them to communicate. For example, I generally dislike phone calls. If I kept getting phone calls reminding me to text if I was going or not, then I\u2019d probably start texting earlier to preempt the phone call.\n\nAs for your daughter, and events in general, surely you should know not to assume your friend will attend. Plan events so you can enjoy with or without them.\n\nI say this having an aunt who is so bad at time management, she\u2019s been over an hour late to parties *in her own house*, not because she wasn\u2019t home, but because she didn\u2019t start getting ready until just before the party started. The rest of the family developed coping mechanisms: Give her an earlier time. Make sure her husband knew, and make sure he was in charge of getting their son ready and available on time. And yeah, plan events with or without her, and don\u2019t wait up.\n\nAt this point, you have to take some responsibility for letting this happen over and over again, and also for setting up your daughter to be disappointed.", "Have you ever communicated your problems with her tardiness and communication?

It would only be received well if I tell her kindly but I\u2019m not sure I need to \u2018teach\u2019 her how to treat people other than just stop accepting the treatment.  Her family all live in a other state. Her husband is often gone for weeks at a time for work and she has illness and a young daughter so all of these have factored into how much I was willing to accept but I do feel ready to wash my hands of her at this point.", "I can assure you my 1 yr old wasn\u2019t disappointed", "I do agree to an extent about we teach people how to treat us. I in no way was hinging anything on her being there. I was in my mind giving her another chance to be better after she missed my sons birthday and we haven\u2019t spoken in months. She reached out to get coffee. \n\nThis coffee shop is a place I enjoy going to regularly with just my daughter so I wasn\u2019t worried if she didn\u2019t come. I knew I would have a nice time. And we did. I finished my coffee and a muffin before my daughter started to get fussy. \n\nI do still feel disrespected she was 30 minutes late. I don\u2019t feel like I need to mother my friend and follow up continuously. She\u2019s an adult. She should come on time or let me know otherwise. \n\nI felt bad when I wrote this post knowing that the relationship was likely over and she doesn\u2019t have many friends.", "During the coffee date I said I was bummed that the football game didn\u2019t work out and I was looking forward to it but she told me she was ready to divorce her husband and I focused on that. \n\nIn that situation, it was the second time she\u2019d canceled last minute but she did communicate with me, just the morning of. I felt her situation was legitimate and my focus was on being a good friend and helping her.

I have friends that get overwhelmed with Kids and other circumstances like that, so I usually don't set a time with them, but say oke text me when you're ready to go and make sure your travel time is less or equal so you still know you'll be there at the same time or meet at home so you don't have to wait. Whatever you choose to do, you really need to talk to her and explain that if she wants to continue hanging out, she needs to respect your time and situation aswell as her own.

Either way you\u2019re NTA.", "Ah, lol. Guess I missed that part and misinterpreted your daughter crying. Good on you for stepping away.
