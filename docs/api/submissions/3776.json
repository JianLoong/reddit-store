If she's going to be late, she MUST text you before she's late, otherwise you wait 15 minutes then GO.\n\nIf she's cancelling she must cancel with REASONABLE notification(and before event starts).  It's a little harder to make consequences here, but perhaps one would be reimbursement for lost money(ie cost of food and gift bag).  You may feel more comfortable NOT giving consequences because the reasons for cancelling may be such reasonable OR it is hard to design for unknown events.  However, you can still say This is my boundary.  And if she crosses it you then explain what the consequence is at that point(ie no longer inviting her to Son's birthday parties).   \n\nI fear she may simply be a person who doesn't respect other people's time(either you specifically for some reason or anyone's).  You deserve to be treated with respect so if she doesn't change her behavior, letting the friendship die is not an unreasonable choice.  \n\nDon't ghost her tho, if she calls, be clear that you can't make the time.

It drove me crazy. I hate being late to things, especially if it's an event we are going to out of town. The later we are the less time we get to spend at the thing we were doing. But we also always had to leave the moment she was ready to be done no matter if the rest of the group wasn't ready to leave. If we didn't she threw a tantrum like a child. I'm really glad we aren't friends any more. She is an immature, bitter woman with no self control and a huge temper who has basically imploded every friendship she has at this point.

And when I'm not sure I make an educated guess as early as possible (1-2 days beforehand) so that the other person can make plans with someone else. Not letting you know is simply disrespectful and kind of mean. Texting at least a quick message takes literally seconds. There is no excuse for not letting you know - especially for *repeatedly* not letting you know. You say you feel bad for her, which is understandable, I guess.

Why is her time more important than your time?", "Or have her meet somewhere convenient for you where you\u2019d spend time regardless like your home or a park. If she comes, great.

And while I certainly don\u2019t feel entitled to anybody\u2019s time or mental energy part of coming to terms with this for me has been realizing that if I am corrected or told by a friend that I have been acting in a way that is harming or hurting them and I refuse to acknowledge or change my actions that\u2019s on me and that makes me a bad friend. But if I am never made aware or given a chance to change and just expected to \u201cbe nice to people and know that nice people don\u2019t do ____\u201d before being dropped that really isn\u2019t on me and that makes that person a bad friend to me who doesn\u2019t even care about our friendship enough to give me an opportunity to preserve it. And honestly a friendship that is so conditional that you feel you need to teach people by being passive aggressive (you left even though she was pulling in. You could have taken that opportunity to clearly communicate to her that you are upset that she is always late and that you need her to be on time. Communicating your boundaries is your responsibility and you can\u2019t expect people to change or be motivated to change by enforcing boundaries that only you know the terms of.

I have friends who don't mind and I just visit them at their house with a vague time, and its understood the time will be approximate ie \"when I get there, I get there\". I also have friends who are very fussy about their time. Those friends I try very hard to be on time for and am rarely more than 10 minutes late. If I'm late, I text them to let them know BEFORE I am late. I don't leave people sitting in a cafe or restaurant waiting for me. I wouldn't expect someone to wait longer than 10-15 minutes without any communication. Even I wouldn't.", "NTA\n\nHowever, I just want to hop on the top comment to recommend you don't cut contact.\n\nOftentimes, when people show up late or have last minute excuses there's something else going on. And the whole \"argument with her husband\" thing, though small, just rings an \"abusive relationship\" bell in my head for some strange reason.\n\nI used to be late to everything because my ex would get on a power trip about me \"Not telling him how long it takes to get ready\". It all came to a head when we took a nap before my uncle's funeral. I realized that we would be late if we didn't get up right then, get dressed and go.\n\nHe ended up throwing an ottoman at my head. 12 stitches later I missed the funeral. \n\nJust let her know that if anything is going wrong at home, she's got a safe place to vent with you.", "After the first time when she ghosted me at the brunch place we talked after and I said that it wasn\u2019t cool and I needed more notice if our plans were changing. I said I understand things happen and we sort of moved on until the football thing happened a few months later. Then I said I was disappointed that we weren\u2019t going to the game but the conversation was mainly focused on her marriage. I think I could have said more looking back. But it just felt like she needed to talk about their fight and then we moved forward again. Then my sons birthday. She knew her daughter was sick well before the party but I had to reach out to her an hour in to see if she was coming when I finally was able to take a minute away from hosting duties. I didn\u2019t tell her I was hurt after this. Maybe that was a missed opportunity but I hadn\u2019t planned on talking to her again after that.  She reached back out a few months after.  We texted a bit and then that led to us meeting up or almost meeting up for coffee earlier today. Now I think I\u2019m truly done. Whether she fully understands why I don\u2019t know but I won\u2019t be responding to any more requests to meet up after today.", "There\u2019s nothing passive aggressive going on. I left bc my daughter was crying after we waited and finished my coffee and muffin and were just walking around. She was fussy and tired. \n\n I texted my friend that we had to go when I saw her pulling in bc my daughter was crying. It\u2019s not like I saw her pulling in and was like \u2018time to go!\u2019\n\nAlso lots of assumptions being made. I have mentioned to her I was disappointed about the football game not working out. I also mentioned to her I would like more notice when possible to help me plan better after the first time she ghosted me at the brunch place. I have had time to think it over and I am done with this friend. I deserve to have my time respected. I felt guilty about hurting her feelings before but I think I\u2019m better off after having some time to process.", "She\u2019s an asshole. Forget she ever existed.", "I understand that you feel that you have communicated to her and you have every right to decide who you want to remain friends with. But you did not actually tell your friend \u201cwhen you are late or you change or cancel our plans at the last minute it makes me frustrated with you and it makes me feel like you do not respect my time. If you cancel our plans or are late without a good reason and plenty of notice in the future I will be reconsidering whether I would like to continue being friends with you\u201d. That would be clear communication. Mentioning that you were disappointed about plans working out one time, and then telling her that you\u2019d appreciate more notice might be what you consider clearly communicating to her that you feel disrespected but to her and to a lot of people these things could easily be considered to be isolated incidents that were resolved and forgiven.\n\nI agree you absolutely deserve to have your time respected but I just think YTA for dropping your friend for violating a boundary that you never actually communicated to her, probably because you didn\u2019t want to have that uncomfortable conversation. You absolutely have the right to not be her friend anymore but I just don\u2019t think you\u2019re any better of a friend to her than she was to you in your mind. I think you\u2019re probably both better off tbh because you have different expectations of the friendship and that never ends well. That\u2019s my opinion which is why we are both here right.", "So an ultimatum would have been better in your opinion? Interesting take\u2026\n\nPart of being a good friend is being self aware and idk giving a shit about your friend. I\u2019d be so embarrassed to be 30 minutes late. I would have called or texted and apologized for making the person wait. \n\nEx: If another adult hits me I\u2019m not going to treat them like a toddler and say hitting is bad. Use your words. These are all adults in this situation and her lack of emotional awareness is no longer a concern of mine.", "holy crap. OP don't listen to this. you're adults, not kids. you shouldn't need to use flashcards and draw out black and white a frowny face to clearly communicate you're disappointed. the social norm for being 30min late and no show for a specific meetup is to apologize and expect the other person to be somewhat annoyed being it's reoccurring. the fact you already further communicated this is sufficient. if that's not clear enough then either they have problems or are just not respectful of other people and their time. claiming ignorance or that it's not clear is just an excuse to be a bad person", "Ultimatums are only bad if you\u2019re using them to manipulate people into changing their behavior. In this case you\u2019d be issuing an ultimatum on a boundary that you have set for yourself \u201cmy time deserves to be respected and I feel blank action is disrespectful of my time. I cannot control what you do but I can control my response to it, so here is a heads up that my response will be to end the friendship\u201d is not manipulation it\u2019s a very healthy boundary to have. \n\nIf another adult hits you and you tell them \u201cit\u2019s fine I would just appreciate more notice next time before you hit me\u201d and then they hit you again and you\u2019re like \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that you hit me\u201d and then they hit you again and you were like \u201cthis friendship is over\u201d, obviously you are not to blame for being hit that is totally on them but you can\u2019t say that you were clear to them that hitting (which is a bad analogy because if you\u2019re hitting someone you are always intending harm but same can\u2019t be said about poor time management) is a red line for you. \n\nI think if you wanted to consider the possibility of any sort of personal reflection you might want to look into codependency as it sounds like you have a poor understanding of boundaries. I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t have a right to be treated well but simply that if something is a problem for you it is on you to communicate that clearly to someone the first time it happens and absolutely enforce that boundary if it continues past that point. \n\nBut yes you will hurt people if you let them mistreat you (by which I do not mean abuse I mean things like that where some people might have a problem with an action and another may not because it\u2019s a matter of subjective option) and downplay it and pretend to forgive and forget it until you decide you have had enough.", "NTA.\n\nThat isn't a friend, and you shouldn't feel guilty.", "NTA"]}
