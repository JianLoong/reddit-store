If they told you they were running 30 minutes late, or were not going to turn up at all, then you could change your arrangements. But, no, they do not do that. They just leave you hanging whilst time slips away. Then they show zero remorse and are perfectly happy wasting your time and act surprised if you get upset.  I made friends with a really nice woman, clever, funny, interesting and a flake. Despite her other qualities, I stopped making any more arrangements with her to meet up. My life is far too short to hang around, alone waiting for someone.", "NTA. Based on her previous behavior, it was reasonable to assume she wasn\u2019t going to show up after 30 minutes. If she was going to be late she should have told you.", "NTA\n\nShe is not respecting your time and leaves you sit for hours without any word.

She's not a friend.", "op=NTA\n\nbut I feel you haven't specifically communicated on this issue.  \n(ie after football cancellation, you talked about her husband issue not her cancelling issue)\n\nYou need to set some clear boundaries if you want to TRY to keep the relationship.  If she's going to be late, she MUST text you before she's late, otherwise you wait 15 minutes then GO.\n\nIf she's cancelling she must cancel with REASONABLE notification(and before event starts).  It's a little harder to make consequences here, but perhaps one would be reimbursement for lost money(ie cost of food and gift bag).  You may feel more comfortable NOT giving consequences because the reasons for cancelling may be such reasonable OR it is hard to design for unknown events.  However, you can still say This is my boundary.  And if she crosses it you then explain what the consequence is at that point(ie no longer inviting her to Son's birthday parties).   \n\nI fear she may simply be a person who doesn't respect other people's time(either you specifically for some reason or anyone's).  You deserve to be treated with respect so if she doesn't change her behavior, letting the friendship die is not an unreasonable choice.  \n\nDon't ghost her tho, if she calls, be clear that you can't make the time.  If she asks, tell her that her decisions/choices colored your choices.   She doesn't value your time, you do and will no longer have your time stolen from you by her neglect.", "Habitually being late is annoying as hell, but it's the failure to communicate that would cross the line for me.

He\u2019s 80 now. Also he has the opposite problem where he\u2019ll show up 1/2 hr earlier than he needs to lol. \n\nSo sometimes, this is a good solution.

I wouldn\u2019t bother anymore.", "Yeah I had a friend who was habitually late because \"if people want to see her they'll wait for her and she doesn't want to feel rushed\" this can mean that planned outings were frequently delayed by one or more hours because she couldn't be bothered to get off her phone to get ready on time. It drove me crazy. I hate being late to things, especially if it's an event we are going to out of town. The later we are the less time we get to spend at the thing we were doing. But we also always had to leave the moment she was ready to be done no matter if the rest of the group wasn't ready to leave. If we didn't she threw a tantrum like a child. I'm really glad we aren't friends any more. She is an immature, bitter woman with no self control and a huge temper who has basically imploded every friendship she has at this point. What's worse is her husband enables her every behavior even when she physically abuses him. By her own admission she has struck him by throwing things at him. And yet she claims \"she used to be abusive but got better\"", "What I tried doing was giving them the time, but then I'd figure that they were gonna be late so I'd just show up late too. Then it got to the point where they'd text me and be like \"hey, sorry I didn't show up\" and I'd say \"that's okay, I didn't show up either\" so it worked out.\n\nAnyway, we aren't really friends anymore."]}
