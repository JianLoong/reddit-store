The issue arose when I told my sister (27F) about the menu plans, and she completely lost it, claiming I'm being unreasonable and forcing my beliefs on everyone.\n\nI tried explaining that it's my wedding and I want it to reflect my values, but she insists I'm being inconsiderate to our meat-loving family. Now, she's threatening to boycott the wedding altogether if I don't include at least some non-vegan options.\n\nI love my sister, but I don't want to compromise on my principles for my big day. AITA for sticking to my vegan guns, or should I make changes to keep the peace?", "created_utc": 1702808647, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kegoa/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_overreacting/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You absolutely should not change your plans. It is not as if vegan food is poisonous. If they need meat that much, they can make themselves eggs and bacon for breakfast.

You really can't make allowances for such people.", "NTA vegan food is not all bland and boring like some people think. My daughter is vegan, and when I'm out with her, I eat vegan food.

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing a buffet or whether it\u2019s plated meals, but you should definitely take other restrictions into account.

It can be yellow too?! I'd never seen that before. I knew it wasn't cantaloupe or honey dew but was confused what the yellow fruit was until I looked it up. It's watermelon and it tastes exactly the same but the texture is softer?? Hard to explain. I thought it was so cool). And there was this one cheese that for the life of me I don't know what it was but I legit dream about sometimes lmao. It was like cheddar but super soft and had all these herbs inside.. it tastes like Pringles sour cream and onion not gonna lie. Add that to a cracker and it was amazing. And of course that's not getting to the pizza! They had a caterer who made them right then and there with fire (obviously he made whole pizzas then and there not individual slices haha) apparently he was known for being vegan friendly and all the options were fantastic. They had 4 pizza options (one having 2 out for a total of 5 pizzas I'll get to that in a moment). The first was what looked like a sausage pizza with some form of green leaf? Apparently it was a meat substitute, not sure what. My husband got that one and he liked it a lot. The next was a pizza with various peppers and onion on it, that's the one i got and my mouth still drools over it. The third I think was a classic Veggie pizza and then the 4th and \"5th\" were simple cheese pizza. My friend later explained they knew a lot of their guests weren't used to vegan food or might be particular about their toppings so they made sure to have two cheese pizzas out for those who were looking for something familiar. They'd just lose out on the pepperoni which is no big deal, certainly not something to squabble over!). The cheese admittedly did have a different texture in my opinion but I don't know if that's because it was vegan cheese or because it was my first time having pizza prepared that way. Either way it was just like going to a fancy restaurant and ordering food on my own; you try it and maybe it's not for you the way they specifically prepared it but you can't deny it wasn't good for most! And my goodness was it good for me and my husband!!\n\nThose who truly love you can survive without animals for one night. Like, don't get me wrong I know there's obviously a LOT more to vegan and vegetarian food than salads but that's legit essentially what you're asking of them \"come celebrate our love and eat a salad with us at dinner\". Now I'm sure you'll have options that aren't just salad haha but this is to say- they won't die if they ate a salad without chicken or dairy based ranch. Maybe they won't love it or think it could be better with X in it but the point is to be there for you on your special day- not to critique your menu like it's a 3 star Michelin contender. Frankly speaking if they don't like it they can shuffle it around their plate like any considerate 4 year old and get themselves chicken nuggies from McDonald's later like the grown adult they are without demanding you adjust your wedding to their desires (Note I didn't say needs! Meat is NOT a need) \n\nAs long as you're providing an actual MEAL (not just salad lmao) you're aces in my book. Everyone else can stand to be a little more open minded. Conforming to your beliefs would be allowing you to enter their home and get rid of all their animal products in the lead up to the wedding so all guests in attendance would be \"vegan\" too. This isn't that. This is just choosing your favorite foods for your wedding like any bride and groom does. Ya know what I had? Steak, mashed potatoes and corn, and my husband's selection was salmon, risotto, and Asparagus. We chose our favorite meals to end our favorite night. (We also had a vegan option for our guests, It was a mushroom pasta with this velvety sauce? I can't for the life of me remember the name if it. I didn't get to try it as our meals were selected in advance and we just went with the caterers suggestion for the vegan meal. But the two who did choose it really liked it and complimented it after the fact). .\n\nYou are no different than me even if we differ on meat and no meat. You're just a bride and groom picking out their menu. No one got involved with our menu. They were simply given options and told to talk to us if they had any dietary restrictions (which thankfully no one had to as we preemptively had a vegan option available). Sometimes people show up having no idea what meal they'll be getting. Your family has no right to say you need to include meat when generally they'd just show up and eat what was given at any other wedding. If she doesn't come then that sucks for her more delicious food for you. She doesn't deserve to be there if she's gonna act like a spoiled child over a lack of chicken nuggies.", "OMG what a drama for what they'd be eating ONE SINGLE DAY !  NTA.

I did point that out in my first comment.\n\nB, you can't win an argument when your argument is wrong. It has nothing to do with a persons dietary choice. Vegan food is 'normal' food. Food is food\n\nC, if guests don't go because thy can't embrace a few veggies for a single meal, then they are not worth it. They are there to celebrate a couples relationship. Not get their steak fix.\n\nD, your allergens argument is relevant for all menus not just vegan and veggie ones. Yes, a guest may be allergic to a single dish, but you generally tell people of that beforehand so an alternative can be provided. I mean its just common sense, I should not have to point that out to you.\n\nEDIT: spelling", "Yes, I'm a first aider, and I have an epipen for a shellfish allergy. \n\nIt's why allergens should always be clearly labelled and separated. There is nothing in OP's post to suggest that this won't be the case.", "But people who are vegan think fish\u2019s lives matter. They\u2019re not gonna use their money to buy a bunch of fish carcasses.", "I think most people with common sense don't eat strange things for that reason.", "I don't care what you eat or why.\n\nnot wishing to speak for the OP, but generally vegans do not wear leather or fur. the whole point is that they are indeed against *all* animal cruelty by humans.", "The ones I choose not to answer are truly not worth my time really!!!", "I'm the best cook I just don't want to be fed carrots that I don't like, when I won't be feeding you meat that you don't eat at my wedding where I HAVE INVITED YOU!!!", "Never been invited to a vegan wedding,", "No, maybe you would be stronger if you had some meat in your system maybe even improve your sex life\ud83d\ude44", "Gosh I swear we must also start a movement where we call out vegans for eating all the plants that are meat to be consumed by cows\ud83d\ude44", "Then they shouldn\u2019t be surprised when people object and won\u2019t come.", "Ohh yeah right\ud83d\ude44 so did the invitations also say, DO NOT WEAR LEATHER AT OUR WEDDING??", "How do you know you don't like carrots? Have you ever tried them?", "You can, it doesnt make sense but the great thing about free speech is it doesnt have to. The better argument for a meat system is there is less wasteage as well as many useful byproducts. That said its not the basis of the argument here which is a a person is allowed to cater a wedding to suit there personal beliefs", "was your ex a vegan or something, why are you so mad about this", "One of the most ignorant comments here", "Why are you so mad about me putting my views across regarding this, and also when did it become a norm for society to label people with different views and lifestyles ad angry? Having a different view and putting it out there isn't anger geezzz\ud83d\ude44"]}
