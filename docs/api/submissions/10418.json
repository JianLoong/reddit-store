My sister (14f) is a freshman, and recently came to me while our parents were gone, in the middle of a panic attack, holding a positive pregnant test. She says it's this boy in her class I've seen over here once or twice, she swears it was consensual and I believe her. She knows she isn't ready to be a mother, but she still wants to have the baby and give it up for adoption.\n\nAt this point she I'm completely on her side, we hug and cry it out for a while, and I tell her we'll make a plan on when to tell our parents. I kinda told her, no they need to know, you're pregnant. She starts to explain her plan. She'll hide the pregnancy, find a way to get at least our parents out of this house when she goes into labor, give birth here, and she'll call a friend to drive her somewhere to give up the baby.\n\nAfter a minute to process this, I told her her plan is never going to work. First off, our parents have had two kids I doubt she could ever hide a full pregnancy from them. Second, her physical is in a month, good odds the doctors will know. Third, the idea that she give birth by herself for however long our parents are out is insane, this shit can take days! And obviously giving birth can kill you in a hospital, it's not something you can just do in the tub or your bed. Plus she'll have to get checked out after. I told her this is crazy, we have to tell them.\n\nI offered to do it together, alone or have her do it, but she has a week or I'll have to. I agreed not to tell them who (she's afraid dad will kill them) but everything else. She's saying she'll hate me forever if I do this, and hasn't talked to me since, I'm not sure I did the right thing.", "created_utc": 1676859781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116v8zj/aita_for_telling_my_teen_sister_her_plan_to_give/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get some adults involved. This is insane. She may hate you in the short term. But there are a million health complications that could result in her death or injury by carrying an unchecked pregnancy.", "NTA. Pregnancy and labor are much more dangerous for teens. This will be a high risk pregnancy.", "NTA\nShe is in a panic, I understand...but her parents ARE going to find out. Especially around 5months+ when she starts showing!\nAlso, giving birth isn't as simple as her just pushing it out. You and her aren't equiped for her to give birth at home with no one else. Plus, there is a LOT of blood with it. Parents will notice excessive laundry or bloody laundry....\n\n\nThat isn't even including any potential unseen complications!", "I\u2019ve worked in an emergency room and on a labor and delivery unit as a tech. Your sister needs consistent pre-natal care, checkups, and to at least have someone with experience overseeing the birth. Labor and birth are incredibly dangerous in a \u201cperfect\u201d setting, and even more so in a home birth with no experienced professionals. Not only that, but if something were to go wrong at any point, her best bet is in a hospital. Hospitals will have social workers and resources available to discuss her options, as well as being able to monitor her and the baby to ensure the health and safety of them both.", "NTA. Tell your parents. Her plan will never work but if she is intent on carrying it through it can and will be extremely dangerous. And yeah, the doctors will 100% know", "this goes beyond finding out if you're an asshole. your sister needs professional medical help and your parents need to know", "NTA she\u2019s 14 yrs old while I can understand not wanting to betray her trust your parents have to know!!! You need to tell her that you can go to them together or you\u2019ll tell them yourself she won\u2019t understand now but she will eventually\u2026 good luck to you and your family", "NTA\n\nHer plan is the plan of a child. She needs to go to the doctor immediately and, assuming your parents won't hurt her, they need to be told.", "NTA. Please let an adult know, she\u2019s young and scared and not thinking about it fully", "NTA You need to tell them. There is no way her plan is safe. She maybe angry at you now, but hopefully she will see you are trying to do what is best.", "NTA\nDoing the right thing is rarely ever the easy thing.", "NTA. Q4 is too young to go through that alone IMO. Hopefully your parents can handle it the right way though.", "NTA and realistically she'll get over it, better to have her hate you than put herself in a vulnerable position and risk death, plus how would she know where to give baby up? Prenatal? Doctor appointments and she doesn't even know if she'll carry small", "No I'm not even gonna bother reading this the title says all I need to know NTA", "NTA Unless you think your parents are going to harm her, you should tell them as soon as possible. Her plan is totally unrealistic and could easily result in the deaths of both your sister and her unborn child. Even if your parents were completely crazy and unsafe to tell, that would just mean that you need to carefully think about what other responsible adult in her orbit to go to first. The human brain is far from mature when you\u2019re 14, and your sister\u2019s idea that she can handle treating pregnancy and childbirth as she would a scheme to sneak out after curfew to go to a party just shows how I\u2019ll-equipped she is to handle this situation on her own.", "NTA.  Her plan is how you know she isn't ready to have  a baby.  The fact that her plan didn't include anything about prenatal care is also how you know that she understands nothing about pregnancy or child birth. These are also very important reasons why you need to tell your parents.  Giving birth can be a traumatizing experience for grown women who wanted to have a baby. So imagine what it might be like for a teenage girl who accidentally got pregnant.", "NTA. Remind her you love her and pregnancy is all about dealing with stark reality, not imagined fantasy.  Sadly, she is not autonomous at this stage of her life and needs pragmatic and loving support.  I truly hope this situation bring out the best in all of you.  Good luck.", "Please tell. My sister made it to 5 months secretly at 15. The pregnancy was so high risk, the doctor perform a late-term termination. I can\u2019t imagine if she made it further. NTA.", "NTA.  You're doing what you can to keep her safe.  I'm sorry you and she are in this crappy position, but you're absolutely doing the right thing.", "NTA. Her plan is just completely unrealistic and just overall a bad idea. I get betraying her is gonna suck, but your parents need to know. And yes, that likely means she's gonna be very upset with you for the foreseeable future, but hopefully, with time, she will understand *why* you told them.", " NTA.  You are doing the right thing.", "NTA\n\nWorst plan ever. She\u2019s thinking like a scared 14 yr old.

An unassisted birth is insanely dangerous. She could easily die, the baby could die, she could be injured or lose her future fertility..this is simply not an acceptable option. And if she is going to have this baby, she owes it proper prenatal care. I\u2019m not sure what the point of giving up a baby for adoption is if you are going to neglect it in utero and during birth. She is a child herself and needs an adult to think through this with.", "NTA. I think you're the only one thinking logically here and that is understandable given your sister's age. The only thing I may suggest is not waiting a week to sit down and talk to them with or without your sister. The only reason I suggest this is your parents may not react favourably if they know that you've known for an entire week what is going on and not told them. \nEither way telling them today or in a week isn't an AH move if your sister doesn't tell them. Her plan is plain dumb and she is going to need so much support throughout the pregnancy if it goes ahead, but especially if she goes through with giving it up for adoption because that isn't as easy as she thinks it will be. \nYour sister may not talk to you for a while but in time she will come around and see you did the right thing if she doesn't tell them herself. You would only be the AH is you go along with her crazy plan.", "nta, she's only a teen, she's going to make rash decisions. but you putting her through and explaining everything is the right thing. in a few days or so, she'll understand.", "NTA Your sister will need prenatal care for herself and the baby. There is more to a pregnancy than just the delivery. Let her be angry for now, you are doing the right thing. Imagine how bad it would be if something tragic happened at the birth or your sister made a tragic choice out of fear and immaturity and you could have prevented it. You see Dateline episodes about girls who hid their pregnancy.", "She needs medical attention. There is no way to predict how the pregnancy will go and she could get into some real health issues if she isn\u2019t being monitored by a medical professional.", "NTA! OP I get your sister is scared anyone would be just make sure to be there for her no matter what. She needs medical care throughout the pregnancy teens especially young ones are in a high risk category in pregnancy she will also need counseling throughout and after the pregnancy heck even if she chose to get a abortion she would need counseling it sucks she is in this position it\u2019s not a easy one. \n\nCould you possibly take her to talk with a Doctor at somewhere like planned parenthood about what to expect what her choices are the risks involved basically everything pregnancy related before going to your parents? Just in hopes it will maybe make her more comfortable to tell them", "NTA \n\nGod I feel for your parents your sister is gonna put them through hell", "NTA\n\nHer plan is dangerous for so many reasons. She needs prenatal care while she\u2019s pregnant, and obviously planning to deliver at home is ridiculously dangerous. As angry as she is and may continue to be with you, you have to tell them if she won\u2019t for her own health and safety, not to mention the health and safety of her unborn child. \n\nHugs to you, I know this is a difficult situation for you to be put in.", "NTA. What other option was there?", "NTA / she is 14 you need to tell your parents.", "Which moms are most likely to kill new borns? One who hide their pregnancy. \n\nAdditionally,  as your sister is so young the dangers to her are very real.\n\nLucky she has you.", "NAH. She has no idea what she\u2019s doing. She has no idea how dangerous pregnancy can be, and more dangerous with no prenatal care. \n\nChildbirth is painful and more difficult for young teenagers.\n\nShe needs help. She clearly is afraid to tell your parents. Does she have good reasons to be afraid?", "NTA. Her plan is potentially dangerous. You\u2019d be TA if you didn\u2019t speak up. You should give her more time though, she\u2019s clearly young and panicking. There\u2019s time to fix this without rushing an outcome in the next week.", "Nta... and this is why 14 yr old children shouldn't get pregnant. Tell your parents she isn't old enough, nor mature enough to realize what she needs. Prenatal care (which she didn't mention/ realize), along with other help and supports is she chooses adoption. Not to mention how it may affect school....", "OP explain to her this is not **Euphoria** where she thinks she can hide the pregnancy like they did in the tv show.  She's not living in reality and if she hates you for a while then so be it.  The boy's parents need to be alerted to what's happened as well because he's also a responsible party, assuming he's the same age and she's being honest about it.  If he's older then there's a whole host of other issues your parents are going to need to deal with.  The sooner the better though before your parents blame you for withholding the information for too long.", "NTA. Your sister can hide an abortion, but not a full pregnancy and birth.", "NTA, this may go without saying but please don't tell your parents the news if it would actually put her in danger (if you think they would kick her out, force her to keep it, force her to abort, etc).\n\nThat being said her plan is terrible! What matters the most right now is supporting your sister. If it's genuinely best for your parents to not know then she can go to a hospital anonymously using public transportation or having a friend drive her and better have the adopter or agency lined up beforehand. \n\nI hope that your parents wouldn't punish her harshly and that she can have a safe birth and pregnancy.", "I agree with getting an adult involved but don\u2019t let anyone change her decision on adoption.  It wouldn\u2019t hurt looking a safe haven location in you area just in case.", "NTA\n\nAt 14 she is very likely to lack the emotional maturity to understand the weight of these decisions.\n\nAnd that's not something you should be risking.\n\n\nAlso, fuck is wrong with kids these days, the fuck you having unprotected sex at 14 for? The fuck you need to have sex at all at 14 for... Oh, wait, restrictive sex education programs because religion. Cool & normal.", "Definitely NTA. Your sister will need to have lots of medical care to have a safe pregnancy, especially that young! She is at an increased risk for complications because of her age. Also, having a planned home birth is reasonable when you can take measures to help minimize the risks of infection, bleeding, and other complications. This however isn\u2019t that. She is in no way prepared to minimize those risks. Pregnancy also comes with a lot of hormonal changes that can make emotions pretty extreme. She will need a solid support system. If she followed through with her plan it would endanger her life. You are doing the right thing by telling your parents, this isn\u2019t something you both can handle on your own.", "NTA - The best thing for her health is to have prenatal care throughout the pregnancy and give birth in a hospital. The best thing for the baby\u2019s health is prenatal care, birth in a hospital and an arrangement with an adoption agency before birth. Just dropping off a baby at a safe drop site is an option but it\u2019s not the best option for the baby. If you feel that telling your parents is safe, you should encourage her to do that. Good luck!", "NTA. Your sister is thinking like a 14 y.o. You need to tell your parents immediately. You know them best so you can decide the best way to do it but it does need to be done. Luckily, she confided in her big sister so you have to be responsible one. Good luck.", "NTA. Generally I\u2019m against siblings squealing, but her and the child\u2019s lives are at stake. My sister in law tried that and hid her pregnancy until 8 months along, then there was little time to make plans, plus she never received pre-natal care. Your parents need to be told asap.", "NTA\n\nYou are doing the right thing. She has no clue what's getting ready to happen. There's prenatal care to think of as well. One week. Hold firm.", "NTA.   I bet in the end when she\u2019s facing the reality of birth she\u2019ll be thankful you told them.  If they find out on their own she\u2019d be likely to throw you under the bus.  Plus like everyone else is saying she needs to be under medical care, the sooner the better.  At 14 she\u2019s living in a dreamworld where everything will just work according to her plan.  Good luck", "NTA she is 14 she isn't thinking clearly about her safety and health. Giving birth at home unassisted with no medical professionals is very unsafe for both her and the baby. 100% your parents need to know and be involved unless they would be a threat to her health and safety but if thats the case thats a whole other issue. She won't hate you forever, she will forgive you. She is a child and she can't and shouldn't go through this alone without her parents support.", "NTA. Her plan was unsafe for her and the baby. Additionally, she needs parental care. It would be irresponsible not to tell them.", "NTA she is a lucky girl to have such a loving and smart sister, some day she will understand that. You did exactly the right thing.", "NTA - there\u2019s an episode of *Call the Midwife* where a teen hides her pregnancy and gives birth in secret and almost dies as a result. It\u2019s not just complications with the birth itself that could put your sister at risk, she could easily get an infection or have issues with her blood pressure, there\u2019s so much that could go wrong in this situation. Regardless of her reasoning for wanting this to stay secret, your parents do need to be made aware of the situation.", "NTA your sister needs support from a midwife. Giving birth alone is not safe, but it\u2019s actually fine to give birth at home, providing its with the appropriate support.", "NTA. She absolutely will need support. HOWEVER I think she should have the right to labor and birth at home (with a qualified midwife) if she prefers that option and is deemed low risk. Her age alone isn\u2019t a risk factor against that.", "Pregnant 14 year old. Gross.\n\nNTA btw", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Normally I would encourage you to support your sister with her wishes\u2026being pregnant, when you don\u2019t want to be is terrifying.  But she is 14.  Being pregnant at 14 is highly dangerous.  It is an automatic high risk classification in most areas.  She has no idea what is coming,  I know she thinks she does.  But trust me, I\u2019ve given birth 3 times, first at age 30.  I thought I knew.  I DID NOT.  I was fully supported and loved by my husband, had top notch medical care and it was frightening at times.\n\nYour sister has threatened you with hating you forever.  I\u2019m truly sorry, but it is worth risking her never speaking to you again and revealing her secret.  If she were drunk and about to drive, you would do what you had to in order to stop her.  If she had a bottle of pills she was threatening to take, you would do whatever you had to in order to stop her.  Attempting to bring a pregnancy to full term in secret at age 14 is just as dangerous as tripping while carrying a loaded gun.  The normal rules of civility and sisterhood have to go out the window.

Thankfully, you're that adult, and she trusted you enough to tell you. Of course her parents need to be told.

The question is not whether to tell your parents; the question is what the best setting is.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is willing to put herself and her baby in terrible danger.  It seems like her embarrassment and shame is overriding the logical parts of her brain.  She also doesn't seem to understand how dangerous birth can actually be.
