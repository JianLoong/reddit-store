Combat isn't always the first choice in human behavior.   Sometimes tact works better.", "Your choice.  For several hundred years, humans have successfully changed societal behavior in positive ways without being combative about it.  If you choose that path, fine.  However, it seems to me that sharing opinions rather than open combat is a more successful way of changing behavior.  Do you think that Hillary Clinton got where she is by bashing everyone she disagreed with?  She's probably one of the all time most important women in history.  Is there a person alive today that doesn't respect her?", "Maybe you misunderstood the old phrase.  It is a comparison of how to do things, not when to do them.  Opening a door may be different for you, but is it different for everyone?  The point that I am trying to make is that we all might be better off if we avoided jumping to conclusions.  If jumping to conclusions is what you prefer, then that's your choice.  I'm just sharing my thoughts.  What you think or what you do is your choice and makes no difference to me.", "I get what you're saying ..But he was saying that as in regards to the large/heavy item you were carrying. Was it the most PC comment to make? No...But I am a big believer that internet matters. And his intentions were from kindness", ">People like that will never realize their behaviour is unacceptable if people always shut up and let it go.\n\nFair point.  To me, his intent is what matters the most and he was just trying to be helpful, but you're right...no need to let him continue down this road.

Why?", "This is really stupid and kinda really gross, and I hope OP doesn't read this without realizing the subtle backwards negging you're trying to do.  \n\nYou've basically ignored the fact that Hilary Clinton is a one, a woman, and two, in politics. Part of playing the political game is, in fact, not being outwardly \"combative\", whatever way you're defining that. This is just how politics works and trying to compare that to the everyday tribulations of a woman experiencing sexism is weird. Especially when you consider that that even when women are not \"combative\", they are still subject to the same behaviors or even worse. \n\nYou're also strongly suggesting that OP was not just combative, but *too* combative. Which I think is pretty ridiculous considering all she did was answer a [rude] question. \n\nStop all of this, please. \n\n>Is there a person alive today that doesn't respect her?\n\nYes, plenty. Duh.", "Is this a serious reply?", "Nope. Societal behavior changed mostly by older generations dying and by merciless shaming of antisocial behavior.\n\nOp is doing right.", "No, it's *your* choice to educate yourself, and not be a sexist pig.", "And girls cannot carry large heavy items?", "I see where you're coming from! And I do think intent matters, at least to a certain point. I'm just not sure about this guy OP writes about... the comment later about her not smiling really just reads as textbook sexist to me. His good intentions don't matter to me if he's coming from the POV that women are weaker or whatever.", "Kinda but it would have hit better had you said it to the boomer \ud83d\ude02", "I didn't say not to say anything about it.  I said not to say anything about it in public.  The point was made with the phrase \"praise in public, criticize in private\".  You should certainly have spoken to him ... but, in private.  Just my opinion.  You are the decider.", "I am not suggesting anything.  I wrote exactly what I think and if you try to say there is a suggestion there, read it again.  There are lots of people who don't agree with Hillary's politics.  But, if there is one person who disrespects her, it's someone who knows nothing about her life and what it took to get where she is.", "If you take a moment to read, the most influential women in history became influential by using their brains...  Hillary Clinton, Justice Sotomayer, Justice Kagan, Justice Jackson, Justice Barrett rose to power without using rude behavior in their daily lives.  You can use rude behavior to win the battle, but winning the war is going to take more.", "You're totally missing the point. It's not that they can't. He sees it as respectful to do it if he's around instead of a lady doing it. If he grabbed your ass and told you to go get in the kitchen I could see your argument. Also, I know a few women from a different country, that if they get to the door first will actually wait there for a man to open it for them. I thought this was sexist and ridiculous too... but that's how they were raised as what is respectful. I don't see the point in cussing people out for this", "Yep.  We agree.  People should be kind until they can't be, in my eyes.  No need to embarrass this guy, but I wasn't there to hear how things were said either.", "Love that dick comment, I use it all the time \ud83d\ude02", "Telling someone they're wrong is not \"rude.\"", "I don\u2019t see it as respectful to get something taken out of my hands and being belittled because of my gender.", "Public statements of misbehavior are rude.

There was nothing wrong with him helping you. But he should have approached you better. And respected your choices.\n\nThing is, there's a difference to being chivalrous and being sexist.\n\nChivalry would have been to ask if you'd like some help. Sexist is to assume and insist you NEED help.\n\nThen the comments about smiling is sexism 101.", "NTA\n\nIck. A \"smile, it makes you prettier\" moment if ever I saw one.

I'm normally very nice to people in retail (its where I started) but I lost it. Use of the word 'Girl' imples that females want to be perceived as attractive to men, (youthful, pretty, deferential etc.).  Only men who are sorry to see the world change think calling a female aged >18 is a compliment. \n\nI explained to him I've driven all over the world, see roads, he can't imagine, solo and I am nobody 'girl'!\n\nWho does he think prepares all the fold up tables in food service? hotels? restaurants? all the underpaid women.  Now it may give him some notion that he has something either women want or women envy, when in fact, that's not the case.\n\nCondesention is the tool of the sexist.  You point out he's an AH and he tells you you're confused, he's a GOD, you just don't notice his qualities and that's a flaw in you!  He is afraid of the world when his automatic privilge is gone, the new world where a man has to show his skill / talents and the old world one may saying another man is management material - thats gone.  \n\nTypically I reply with worlds like 'HoneyBun', 'Snookums', 'Sugarpuff' -equivlants to 'Girl' - they generally get confused at this point.  Eventually they realize you're mocking them", "What Boomer? We\u2019re second wave!", "What the fuck?", "Him lending the tent doesn\u2019t give him the right to be a sexist. Him not wanting for me to carry a table because of possible damages is okay as long as it is phrased like \u201cplease let me to it. I am paranoid about damages.\u201d Or \u201cdo you need help?\u201d\nAssuming I lack strength because I lack a penis is neither nice nor acceptable. \n\nYes him lending the tent was nice. But that doesn\u2019t entitle him to any behaviour he likes. He still can be nice about one thing and a sexist on the other hand.", "What do you mean?", "I was responding to the comment above. If he didn't help everyone would say he's lazy. Since he does help (and admittedly three in an unnecessary comment) he's sexist. People can't win in these situations. The males in my family jump up and do the heavy lifting so the women don't have to and we're appreciative of it. Doesn't mean we can't means they don't want us to.
