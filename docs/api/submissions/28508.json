Joe is in his late 60s and is retired. Living with us since I was in middle school. \n\nWhen I was in highschool, Joe would buy me clothes from wish.com, which were quite skimpy. I always denied him when he asked me what I wanted, but he would buy it and give it to me anyways. Same thing with my little sister. I told some teachers at school and they advised me to tell my dad and tell him \u201cNO\u201d much stronger next time. \n\nMy dad told him to cut it out, but my mom was sympathetic. Joe stopped, but every once in a while he would buy misc items or snacks/candies/treats and give them to us. \n\nThe older I got, the more I learned that Joe was a bad father to his four kids in the past. Abandoned them, and now he feels guilty about it. He also has a hobby of talking to foreign women online and giving them \u201cadvice\u201d and occasionally money. \n\nMy mother brought him up today, and commented at how ungrateful I was when Joe gave me gifts. Keep in mind I always denied to idea of the gifts, but if they were bought, I always said thank you. I\u2019ve never been impolite to the renter either.\n\nI told my mother that I did not ask for the gifts and I didn\u2019t want them. She kept saying it was rude of me and that he just \u201cloves you and your sister\u201d. I told my mother \u201cwe don\u2019t know him, he just feels guilty about his past and wants to make it up with us\u201d. My mother said \u201cwhen you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll understand, when you love someone you want to give them gifts\u201d.\n\nI found this incredibly creepy and walked out of the room. My mother is still strong on her position and said I should give Joe more attention.
