I (19m) was dating a girl (18f) let\u2019s call her jess. Jess has a sister 17F let\u2019s call her Nicky. At the time I was debating on proposing to my then girlfriend. After some time I set up a 4 day trip to my hometown/a beautiful spot in the mountains so I could propose. I won\u2019t go to far in detail on the story just know she said yes. Before we left on the trip i decided to test Jess\u2019a sister Nicky. Nicky was always in her room and wouldn\u2019t take care of animals she just \u201chad to have\u201d she was a big fan of keeping her dog in a kennel. I\u2019m very against the idea of just keeping any animal kenneled and it drove me crazy. A lot of the time when I\u2019d come over the dog would have used the bathroom in its kennel, have no food or water, and would be absolutely miserable if Jess hadn\u2019t been able to care for it since she\u2019s a busy person with school. I would let it out/ clean its kennel, feed it ect. So Jess could focus on school. When we left I decided to place a small piece of string on the door of the kennel (after feeding it, watering it, and letting it out) the string wouldn\u2019t keep the door closed and would break if the door was opened with even a tiny bit of effort. \n\n      After the 4 day trip I took my now fianc\u00e9 home, and when we got there I checked on the dog. I was disgusted. The string wasn\u2019t broken, the dog was sleeping in a kennel full of its own feces and the bowls bone dry. I yelled for nicky until she came out of her room, I blew up, I was so mad I don\u2019t remember verbatim what I said but it was along the lines of \u201care you serious right now? We were gone for 4 days and you couldn\u2019t spend just 30-40 minutes a day to take care of (enter dogs name)? You\u2019re the laziest piece of shit I\u2019ve ever seen. You are a despicable and absolutely disgusting!\u201d We went back and forth and I left because I just couldn\u2019t handle it any more. Now heres where I may be the asshole. I called the police/animal control. The dog was removed from the house and put into a no kill shelter. Jess is saying I went to far saying that her sister should be kenneled, but I don\u2019t think I did. She\u2019s threatening breaking off our engagement and im not quite sure what to do. I don\u2019t think what I did was wrong but maybe it was?\n\nEdit: Added paragraph spaces so it wasn\u2019t a wall of text.", "created_utc": 1700555915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180ch9p/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriends_sister_a/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did good for that dog and while you said some harsh things, they're all true. I can understand that Jess may be angry at you for lashing out to her sister, and for that I think you should apologize to her and try to explain what you did in the past for that dog, why you did it and your feelings about animal cruelty as clearly as possible. What Nicky was doing to that dog (and maybe other animals) was horrible and there is no excuse to mistreat any living being that way. I'd be ashamed if any of my siblings did anything like that and even though I might get angry if someone lashed out to them, I know I would understand the reason behind it. In any case I wouldn't threat my relationship with my fiance for that. Seems kind of childish or even kind of a red flag to me since an engagement (and love) is not something to weaponize or hold above someone's head just because someone got angry about something bad someone else did, no matter how close that person is.", "NTA at all!! I\u2019m not a fan of big dogs and my husband brought a German Shepard home, she\u2019s not my favorite but I would never not walk her, feed her, and clean up after her.. how can she do that?! That\u2019s a sick human", "No you did the right thing. In a round about way, it's probably a good thing too as it has shown your partner in an unflattering light. NTA.", "nta, you did the right thing by reporting the animal abuse. sounds like nicky needs a wake-up call about responsibility. jess needs to understand the severity of the situation.", "Nta because you saved the dog. Idc about anything else in this story. Thanks for saving it", "NTA you did the right thing.\n\nMight be worth rethinking your relationship as she is fine with how her sister treated the dog.", "NTA\n\nThey were abusing an animal.", "Absolute hero not an arsehole , I salute you sir", "Nta but dont marry so young dude", "NTA Nicki needs to be put in a animal control shelter as well. And not the no kill kind either. You should have told her that as well. It\u2019s never too late", "NTA. If your gfs sister can't take care of pets then she shouldn't have them at all. They're not just inanimate objects, they're living, breathing beings with emotions and needs. Calling animal control also does not make you TA whatsoever, that poor baby deserves a loving family. You did the right thing", "I used to have 2 dogs and they always slept in the bed with me", "Everything you said and more! \nIt speaks volumes about who Nicky is that she can treat this poor animal so despicably! \nI guess I can understand why Jess wouldn\u2019t want to believe the worst about her sister! Is you saying \u201cher sister should be kenneled\u201d the thing Jess is most upset about and what are her feelings about what Nicky did??\nI can\u2019t believe that you and Jess can\u2019t work this out. In time, when things calm down and more rational heads prevail, sit with her and talk this through. For now you\u2019re NTA!", "I can\u2019t even imagine my toebeans to be in kennels for so long, in fact theyre sleeping in the people bed with me as I type this out \ud83d\ude2d I just wish that was the case for all the beans in the world \u2639\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nIf there's one thing I feel worthwhile in burning down a meaningful, important relationship over, it would over the health and welfare of a defenseless dependent - whether that's an animal or a person. If I've taken on the obligation to care for an animal, I take that seriously. The sister deserves everything you said to her, you were totally correct.  Your girlfriend's willingness to look past it -- I would have a hard time working through that after seeing the state of that dog. I would also, if I'm being honest, blame myself as well for leaving the dog there and the GF for supporting that as an option. I struggle to believe she thought her sister would treat this dog even remotely how it deserved based on what happened. Maybe that's a blindside to the GF, but I just don't think so.\n\nThis is a cataclysmic fuck-up, to me. Such terrible abuse of something I have committed to care for, and trusted someone to honor that commitment for me. I would regret my own mistake in trusting this person, and would struggle to *ever* forgive them. Anyone who defends is terrible as well. If your girlfriend thinks that her sister deserves anything close to apology, she is wrong. And I would, personally, be willing to hold that hard line until the end of days. \n\nGF's sister tortured that animal. That's just a **fact**. If someone is willing to defend that, minimize that... do you *want* to marry them? To be with them?", "NTA- i despise animal cruelty.", "NTA I\u2018m glad you saved the poor dog. It\u2019s really none of my business but I just wanted to give you some advice. I think you\u2019re way too young to get married. If she\u2018s really the one, waiting a few more years should be no problem for you relationship.", "NTA.\nAnimal abusers are not worth caring about.  Nicky is sick in the head.  Get her into a hospital.", "NTA. People who abuse animals are not right. Thank you for protecting the dog.", "You handled the situation poorly, and you know it. Still NTA, but just barely.", "Update: hey guys sorry it\u2019s been a long night but I appreciate all the support on the post. Last night it was a barrage of phone calls from Jess and her mom. (Jess saw the post) She and I have been discussing it and we will not be getting married and will be splitting up. After some thought and some general discussion with my father/best friend I decided it was best for me. This really sucks we have been together since middle school and I do love her but if she\u2019s okay with something like what Nicky was doing, what does that say about her character? Also, I decided to get the dog from the shelter. I called them up this morning and am supposed to go pick them up later this evening. I\u2019m about to go to the store now and buy toys/food/ a soft BED for it to sleep on. The dog has been neglected since it was just a pup and it\u2019s only a year old now so I hope I can give it a better life and a long one at that. I live in a smaller town and we have a beautiful lake with a few mile track around it, I only live about a block away so we will be going for lots of long walks. My best friend said she would be happy helping when I\u2019m at work since I work long shifts and has even offered to set up a spot for him at her house. Unless something crazy happens this will be the only update. Also, for those of you wondering the dog is a German shepherd.", "YTA. You could have had a discussion with your fiance but you don't respect her enough to do so. You're too busy living in your fantasy as some hero to dogs. Weirdo.", "YTA", "NTA.", "YWBTA if you married this person. If you really are 19, just wait ffs.", "NTA but... \n\nI\u2019d really rethink a relationship with Jess. She is complicit with Nikki neglecting the dog. Is this someone you want to spend your life with? Potentially have children with?", "NTA but am I the only one who laughed out loud reading OP\u2019s comment on how his gf\u2019s sis should be \u201ckenneled\u201d", "NTA. This is a clear case of animal cruelty. I\u2018m so glad you stepped up and put an end to it. I can understand that your fianc\u00e9e has a hard time coming to terms with how messed up a person her sister is but I\u2018m sure she will realise you did the right thing once the situation has calmed down a bit. And if she doesn\u2018t, I\u2018m afraid that would also be very telling.", "NTA. Before you make any decisions on your relationship, think about what *other* types of abuse is your girlfriend would be willing to look past. Would you want to be married to someone who might abuse or allow others to abuse you, and/or any pets or children you might have together?", "NTA.  Animal abuse is among some of the lowest behavior one can display. And they shouldn\u2019t get away with it just because of who they are.  She should be kenneled and left in her own wast, with no food or water.  See how ok she thinks it is then.", "NTA my dog has never stepped foot into a kennel/crate", "NTA. Thank you for reporting the abuse. It was absolutely necessary. I dumped my girlfriend of 3 years when I called the SPCA on a neighbor and saved a starving dog and cat. After finding out their condition, one minute later my ex said I should have minded my own business. Dumped her on the spot and never looked back.", "NTA any one that supports this behaviour or does it needs kenneling them selves", "NTA! Good for you speaking out for that poor animal. If your Fiance wants to break off your engagement because of it, good riddance. That's not someone you want to be married to", "No its best the engagement break off. You want to marry a family of animal abusers?? Even if your fiance didn\u2019t do it herself she knew what was going on and didn\u2019t give two fucks and got mad at you when you literally saved this dogs life\n\nNTA do you wnat to marry a person like that?", "Don\u2019t marry into that family at all.", "Normally I\u2019d advise going off like that, yelling, and calling authorities with no warning but I think this is one of those instances where you\u2019re allowed to flip tables. \n\nYou\u2019re also v young. My suggestion is to never marry before you finish college. Is that crazy advise? Maybe?\n\nEither way Jess doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s missing. You\u2019re better off with someone who defends a dog abuser. \n\nDating since middle school is rough but on the other hand it\u2019s really a small fraction of your life. It will sting the first year but give it time :)", "The sister would not have listened bc she doesn't think she is doing anything wrong and the dog would be stuck in a f*cked up dangerous situation. He had to call someone or take the animal....", "Ew dog hater", "Found nicky", "Wrong answer", "Ew dog lover"]}
