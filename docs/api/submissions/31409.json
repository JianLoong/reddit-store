I (19m) was dating a girl (18f) let\u2019s call her jess. Jess has a sister 17F let\u2019s call her Nicky. At the time I was debating on proposing to my then girlfriend. After some time I set up a 4 day trip to my hometown/a beautiful spot in the mountains so I could propose. I won\u2019t go to far in detail on the story just know she said yes. Before we left on the trip i decided to test Jess\u2019a sister Nicky. Nicky was always in her room and wouldn\u2019t take care of animals she just \u201chad to have\u201d she was a big fan of keeping her dog in a kennel. I\u2019m very against the idea of just keeping any animal kenneled and it drove me crazy. A lot of the time when I\u2019d come over the dog would have used the bathroom in its kennel, have no food or water, and would be absolutely miserable if Jess hadn\u2019t been able to care for it since she\u2019s a busy person with school. I would let it out/ clean its kennel, feed it ect. So Jess could focus on school. When we left I decided to place a small piece of string on the door of the kennel (after feeding it, watering it, and letting it out) the string wouldn\u2019t keep the door closed and would break if the door was opened with even a tiny bit of effort. \n\n      After the 4 day trip I took my now fianc\u00e9 home, and when we got there I checked on the dog. I was disgusted. The string wasn\u2019t broken, the dog was sleeping in a kennel full of its own feces and the bowls bone dry. I yelled for nicky until she came out of her room, I blew up, I was so mad I don\u2019t remember verbatim what I said but it was along the lines of \u201care you serious right now? We were gone for 4 days and you couldn\u2019t spend just 30-40 minutes a day to take care of (enter dogs name)? You\u2019re the laziest piece of shit I\u2019ve ever seen. You are a despicable and absolutely disgusting!\u201d We went back and forth and I left because I just couldn\u2019t handle it any more. Now heres where I may be the asshole. I called the police/animal control. The dog was removed from the house and put into a no kill shelter. Jess is saying I went to far saying that her sister should be kenneled, but I don\u2019t think I did. She\u2019s threatening breaking off our engagement and im not quite sure what to do. I don\u2019t think what I did was wrong but maybe it was?\n\nEdit: Added paragraph spaces so it wasn\u2019t a wall of text.", "created_utc": 1700555915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180ch9p/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriends_sister_a/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did good for that dog and while you said some harsh things, they're all true. I can understand that Jess may be angry at you for lashing out to her sister, and for that I think you should apologize to her and try to explain what you did in the past for that dog, why you did it and your feelings about animal cruelty as clearly as possible. What Nicky was doing to that dog (and maybe other animals) was horrible and there is no excuse to mistreat any living being that way. I'd be ashamed if any of my siblings did anything like that and even though I might get angry if someone lashed out to them, I know I would understand the reason behind it. In any case I wouldn't threat my relationship with my fiance for that. Seems kind of childish or even kind of a red flag to me since an engagement (and love) is not something to weaponize or hold above someone's head just because someone got angry about something bad someone else did, no matter how close that person is.", "NTA at all!! I\u2019m not a fan of big dogs and my husband brought a German Shepard home, she\u2019s not my favorite but I would never not walk her, feed her, and clean up after her.. how can she do that?! That\u2019s a sick human", "No you did the right thing. In a round about way, it's probably a good thing too as it has shown your partner in an unflattering light. NTA.", "nta, you did the right thing by reporting the animal abuse. sounds like nicky needs a wake-up call about responsibility. jess needs to understand the severity of the situation.", "Nta because you saved the dog. Idc about anything else in this story. Thanks for saving it", "NTA you did the right thing.\n\nMight be worth rethinking your relationship as she is fine with how her sister treated the dog.", "NTA\n\nThey were abusing an animal.", "Absolute hero not an arsehole , I salute you sir", "Nta but dont marry so young dude", "NTA Nicki needs to be put in a animal control shelter as well. And not the no kill kind either. You should have told her that as well. It\u2019s never too late", "NTA. If your gfs sister can't take care of pets then she shouldn't have them at all. They're not just inanimate objects, they're living, breathing beings with emotions and needs. Calling animal control also does not make you TA whatsoever, that poor baby deserves a loving family. You did the right thing", "I used to have 2 dogs and they always slept in the bed with me", "Everything you said and more! \nIt speaks volumes about who Nicky is that she can treat this poor animal so despicably! \nI guess I can understand why Jess wouldn\u2019t want to believe the worst about her sister! Is you saying \u201cher sister should be kenneled\u201d the thing Jess is most upset about and what are her feelings about what Nicky did??\nI can\u2019t believe that you and Jess can\u2019t work this out. In time, when things calm down and more rational heads prevail, sit with her and talk this through. For now you\u2019re NTA!", "I can\u2019t even imagine my toebeans to be in kennels for so long, in fact theyre sleeping in the people bed with me as I type this out \ud83d\ude2d I just wish that was the case for all the beans in the world \u2639\ufe0f"]}
