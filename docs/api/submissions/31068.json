Now that want you to be the bad guy and \u201cuninvite\u201d him so he doesnt figure out the real reason he cant go?", "Let\u2019s see. Invite extended? Don\u2019t make it look like you don\u2019t welcome that child. Let the parents say no to the child. You can\u2019t go against them. Just be truthful. Dude is way too sensitive reading more into it than was there. You just wanted to invite the child and no other reason. Ex-partner and hubby dude of hers need to tell the child no. Not make you the heavy. Voting it would make you look like a wimp to cave in to such a request to them and an A-hole to the kid. Keep your backbone. Again, don\u2019t lie to the kid. Warn ex that you will not lie for either of them. And are sorry that they are making it out more than what it is and it\u2019s punishing their kid and yours by not allowing it.", "As others have said already, NTA. But make sure you're not used as scapegoat either. I'd believe that if you explain the situation to your kid, he will explain it to the other kid, so it's not like you have to talk to the other kid or face the other parents about who's going to say what, nor anything. They're 10, so it's not like they need full IRS paper trail to understand the situation. \"I wanted kid B to come with us to Disney, but the other set of parents said he wasn't allowed to go. It sucks, but cheer up, next time he will be able to come with us, for sure\". Done. Gives the kids hope for the future, saves some face for proud dad (he will have to come with another plausible excuse to say no if he doesn't want to accept its a money problem) , and it will be clear that OP is not the bad guy.", "The whole situation is the ah\u2014\nYour compassion and inclusion mean you\u2019re nta, sounds like the new hubs pride is the ah\u2026.. if they want him uninvited, then y\u2019all all need to sit down and explain it\u2026. Otherwise, your son could resent you because he falsely thinks you don\u2019t like his de facto best friend. \n\nBlended families mean everyone\u2019s on the same level, and you\u2019re trying to treat your son and his brother equally. That\u2019s very commendable! \n\nAlways more love in life, not less!!! \n\nGood luck but don\u2019t let them use you as a scapegoat so they don\u2019t have to explain they don\u2019t want you to pay \n\nOr \u2014- last resort to make all happy\u2014- reschedule for the summer", "It sounds like *they* turned down the invitation, so you are not \u201cuninviting\u201d the kid at all. \n\nBut it also sounds like they *want* you to uninvite the kid so that you will be the bad guy instead of the kid\u2019s father. That\u2019s not fair to you. If they don\u2019t want the kid to go to Disney, they need to own it. \n\nBut in the future, you should probably discuss this type of offer with the kid\u2019s father and your ex before you tell your son. \n\nGood luck.", "The problem is your son got excited and invited his step-brother before everything was agreed on. You could try again, telling them that you're sorry this got out before it was agreed on. But you're not going to be the bad guy in this. You need to talk to your son about it. In fact, your ex should sit both boys down and talk to them about blurting stuff out before the adults get a chance to talk it out. \n\nNTA. Your son is only 10. It's not like he was taunting his step-brother. He was excited. He was thrilled! But at this point, all t**hree of you** have to sit down and explain it to the boys.  Be prepared for tears. And be prepared to explain to 10 year olds about pride and stubbornness instead of just doing something nice in a way that they understand.", "NAH - You don't need to rescind the invitation, however, it is 100% his decision whether he allows his son to go or not. He has not known you for long, so he may not fully trust you either. Don't force the issue.", "NTA - your ex and her husband should be telling their son they can\u2019t go, not you, since they are the ones not willing to let their son go. Personally I think it is a bit selfish of them to not let their kid go since you offered to pay for him and the only reason the husband won\u2019t let him go is pride. He\u2019s putting his own insecurities ahead of his child\u2019s happiness. It sucks that your son told his step-brother too soon, kids get excited sometimes. But you are more than willing to still take the kid, dad is the one with the problem.", "Nta.  No longer your responsibilty.
