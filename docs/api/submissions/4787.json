{"id": 4787, "submission_id": "zmm4ph", "title": "AITA for yelling at my girlfriend for being 45 minutes late to work after having just lost a job?", "selftext": "My 23M girlfriend 22F recently lost her job as a chef at a higher-end restaurant because of reasons unknown. she told me that her higher-ups were corrupt and we\u2019re looking to get her out being one of the only other female chefs in the building. \n\nI don\u2019t know too much on that story I just know she got fired, I paid her rent for her because she was unable to pay after being fired and we both started looking for a new job for her. We end up finding a job that she can make $18 an hour working at a warehouse that\u2019s closer to home.\n\nFast forward to today only maybe three or four weeks since getting the job - I am home from work during the week which is rare so I decided to take her to work because of the snow and bad weather. her alarm goes off probably around 740 and she decides she wants to lay in bed until 815. \n\nShe has to be at work at 8 so I start expressing my concern about her being late to work and she tries to tell me \u201cOh it\u2019s fine her boss likes her and she could be late.It doesn\u2019t matter to me. \u201c This is very disrespectful because being late is typically a way that you can get fired and she\u2019s OK being late after I had just paid for her rent after she got fired once already, so I find it disrespectful that she would be OK being late and possibly risking her job. Especially just after losing one. \n\nSo we get into an argument that turns into some yelling and she gets upset saying I shouldn\u2019t even care and it\u2019s her life and her decisions and that I don\u2019t need to worry about it. She then starts getting upset and crying because I told her to get her head on straight, she started making me feel bad for caring so much when I really just don\u2019t want her to have to struggle to find another job but it does bother me that she\u2019s willing to risk one job already after maybe three weeks of working there. \n\nIt just makes me feel like she believes I\u2019m just somebody to fall back on it and she can just do whatever.  She feels as though I am rubbing it in that I paid her rent but in reality I\u2019m hurt because she\u2019s risking her job right in front of my eyes after just losing her job and me have heaving to keep her afloat.

She probably did something at her job that got her fired.\n\nWould she be acting like this if she lived alone?", "NTA. She's ridiculous if she thinks they won't fire her.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to grow up before she gets fired again. Her \u201cdecisions\u201d are not good as she used to be a chef at a high end restaurant but most likely blew it. I can\u2019t tell if you live together but if you do then her decisions definitely affect you. You should make it clear to her that you paying her rent was a one time thing. She obviously just wants you to \u201ccare\u201d when it\u2019s convenient for her (paying rent). I hope she\u2019s supposed to pay you back.", "NTA\n\nAs both an employer and an adult human, You Tell Her! I don't even care if I get blasted here this time, I am in complete agreement with you on this one, OP. Your GF needs to grow tf up. I think it absolutely is within your rights to say something to her, if you're the one paying her way. If she doesn't want to work anymore and/or you *want* her as a \"kept woman,\" so to speak, that's a conversation you two can have together. But until then, quit bailing her out if she's just going to be a sloth.", "NTA but let her know in no uncertain terms that you are not paying her rent next time.\n\nCould it be that she's expecting to live in your house/apartment? \n\nCould it be that she's expecting to be a SAHM?", "NTA, because it genuinely sounds like she has issues getting to work and doing her job. I\u2019m having doubts that she lost her previous job because they were \u201ccorrupt\u201d. Sounds a little delusional.\n\nThat being said idk you can force her to get to work on time. What I would do is tell her that if she gets fired again you won\u2019t be covering her rent this time.", "NTA- the fact is, you paid her rent and she's going to look to you to do it again when she gets fired again. So, aside from just wanting her to have financial stability in her life, you don't want to be paying her rent. I would just say- what's your plan for rent when they fire you for being late. Tell me what it is and I'll back off.", "NTA\nShe does need to get her head on straight", "NTA. Just make her pay you back and if she\u2019s still complaining consider whether that hassle is worth your time", "Definitely NTA. A couple of points here, one, it doesn\u2019t matter if her boss likes her, she shouldn\u2019t be showing up 45 min late. It\u2019s she\u2019s doing that now she\u2019s likely done it before and that\u2019s probably what got her fired in the first place. \n\nTwo, relationships are partnerships and you\u2019re supposed to make each other better. Your concern is warranted and she should be happy she has someone who cares enough to try to push her. I\u2019ve dated people who couldn\u2019t care less what I do and those relationships generally turn out poorly. You may have delivered the message in a less than ideal way (yelling) BUT the message is the same nonetheless. I would sit her down and talk to her and say exactly what you said here. You care about her and don\u2019t want her to struggle.", "NTA, her actions affect you.  Her decisions are affecting you.  You are spending money on her that could go to something for you.  Gf is acting selfish and self centered.  Time to reassess this relationship.", "That's exactly it. She's comfortable right now. Comfortable enough to sleep in past clock in time at a new job, comfortable enough that she knows you will pay the dividend of rent if she loses this job too. \n\nI'm suspicious that she didn't actually lose her last job due to the reasons she specified considering her apathy regarding the new job. \n\nNTA and don't back down. If she wants to be out of a new job, consider telling her to start looking for a new boyfriend or sugar daddy too.", "NTA. She's right in that it's her life and her decisions. But it sounds like you share living space, which makes it pretty vital that she maintain employment. I'm very I guess anal when it comes to relationships and finances. If we live together you need to make damn sure you are making an effort to contribute financially (I understand life happens, but the effort is what's important to me.) If you're not, one of us will be moving out. If we are not living together and life happens, I am not going to help you if it gets in the way of maintaining my lifestyle, & no way will I help you if you're not trying to help yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Depending on the shouting situation you could be TA.

Ok, she gets fired again and needs more money. IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM! Actions have consequences, and that seems to be something she needs to learn. Most places, you're on a probationary period for some time, usually 90 days. In that time period, they can let you go for any or no reason. She's skating on thin ice because she doesn't want to get her ass out of bed. That's irresponsible af! There's an unspoken agreement when you get a job: \"We'll hire you and pay you to do a job. Part of the deal is, to get paid, you actually have to be here on time and do the damned job!\" Her excuse is just that, an excuse, and you know what they say about excuses.

She clearly expects you to bankroll her mistakes, stop doing that.

She maybe depressed and is struggling. She may hate the job but doesn\u2019t want to admit it so she\u2019s trying to do little things to get fired. The fact she talks about the restaurant owners be corrupt could be true, could be she was being harassed and didn\u2019t know how to say anything or was embarrassed. Or she just likes to make up crazy stories to seem more interesting\n\nNow I can only go on the little bit of information given, but you need to take a hard look at your relationship and her behaviour. Is she normally like this or is it new? If she\u2019s normally like this, flaking out and jumping from job to job you need to decide if you can continue to live like this knowing you\u2019ll be paying full rent and bills on a somewhat regular basis. \n\nDoes she have ADHD? We\u2019re prone to time blindness and can sometimes be self destructive but it doesn\u2019t really sound like it from the little bit you\u2019ve shared\n\nIf this is new behaviour, then you need to carefully find out what\u2019s going on\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to figure out what your ok with, are you ok with her bouncing between jobs, possibly having months or a year between them? Where do you see this relationship going? Do you want kids? Do you want to be able to travel as often as possible so having a decent paying job where you can save and travel to exotic places every other year?\n\nYou need to put you and your needs/wants first. If she can be apart of that, great, but if she can\u2019t/won\u2019t or is unable to for whatever reason, then maybe this relationship has run it\u2019s course\n\nNTA, and while yelling at her may not have been the best idea, you sound like you\u2019re very frustrated. Apologize, tell her \u201clook I\u2019m sorry I yelled, but it\u2019s frustrating that I helped you find a new job and then you seem to be trying to get fired. I want us to build a life together (if that\u2019s what you want) I want to be able to travel the world with you. But if you keep bouncing between jobs we can\u2019t have that life\u201d (edit as needed) see what her response is and then you can adjust accordingly\n\nBest of luck", "ESH.\n\nYou need to communicate what you actually mean to her: I don't want you to struggle finding another job.
