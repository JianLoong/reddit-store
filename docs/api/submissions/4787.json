We end up finding a job that she can make $18 an hour working at a warehouse that\u2019s closer to home.\n\nFast forward to today only maybe three or four weeks since getting the job - I am home from work during the week which is rare so I decided to take her to work because of the snow and bad weather. her alarm goes off probably around 740 and she decides she wants to lay in bed until 815. \n\nShe has to be at work at 8 so I start expressing my concern about her being late to work and she tries to tell me \u201cOh it\u2019s fine her boss likes her and she could be late.It doesn\u2019t matter to me. \u201c This is very disrespectful because being late is typically a way that you can get fired and she\u2019s OK being late after I had just paid for her rent after she got fired once already, so I find it disrespectful that she would be OK being late and possibly risking her job. Especially just after losing one. \n\nSo we get into an argument that turns into some yelling and she gets upset saying I shouldn\u2019t even care and it\u2019s her life and her decisions and that I don\u2019t need to worry about it. She then starts getting upset and crying because I told her to get her head on straight, she started making me feel bad for caring so much when I really just don\u2019t want her to have to struggle to find another job but it does bother me that she\u2019s willing to risk one job already after maybe three weeks of working there. \n\nIt just makes me feel like she believes I\u2019m just somebody to fall back on it and she can just do whatever.  She feels as though I am rubbing it in that I paid her rent but in reality I\u2019m hurt because she\u2019s risking her job right in front of my eyes after just losing her job and me have heaving to keep her afloat.

Her \u201cdecisions\u201d are not good as she used to be a chef at a high end restaurant but most likely blew it.

Tell me what it is and I'll back off.", "NTA\nShe does need to get her head on straight", "NTA. Just make her pay you back and if she\u2019s still complaining consider whether that hassle is worth your time", "Definitely NTA. A couple of points here, one, it doesn\u2019t matter if her boss likes her, she shouldn\u2019t be showing up 45 min late. It\u2019s she\u2019s doing that now she\u2019s likely done it before and that\u2019s probably what got her fired in the first place. \n\nTwo, relationships are partnerships and you\u2019re supposed to make each other better. Your concern is warranted and she should be happy she has someone who cares enough to try to push her. I\u2019ve dated people who couldn\u2019t care less what I do and those relationships generally turn out poorly.

Gf is acting selfish and self centered.  Time to reassess this relationship.", "That's exactly it. She's comfortable right now. Comfortable enough to sleep in past clock in time at a new job, comfortable enough that she knows you will pay the dividend of rent if she loses this job too. \n\nI'm suspicious that she didn't actually lose her last job due to the reasons she specified considering her apathy regarding the new job. \n\nNTA and don't back down. If she wants to be out of a new job, consider telling her to start looking for a new boyfriend or sugar daddy too.", "NTA. She's right in that it's her life and her decisions. But it sounds like you share living space, which makes it pretty vital that she maintain employment. I'm very I guess anal when it comes to relationships and finances. If we live together you need to make damn sure you are making an effort to contribute financially (I understand life happens, but the effort is what's important to me.) If you're not, one of us will be moving out.

We\u2019re prone to time blindness and can sometimes be self destructive but it doesn\u2019t really sound like it from the little bit you\u2019ve shared\n\nIf this is new behaviour, then you need to carefully find out what\u2019s going on\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to figure out what your ok with, are you ok with her bouncing between jobs, possibly having months or a year between them? Where do you see this relationship going? Do you want kids? Do you want to be able to travel as often as possible so having a decent paying job where you can save and travel to exotic places every other year?\n\nYou need to put you and your needs/wants first.

She may be overwhelmed with stress and using unhealthy coping mechanisms - which can be hard to control when you\u2019re depressed and feel like everything is meaningless (she might have gone from a job she loved to one that she doesn\u2019t care for but picked just because it was convenient, which can contribute to depressive feelings) - then she feels attacked by the yelling, which in turn triggers her defense mechanism of \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d when she knows it\u2019s really not but still can\u2019t force herself to get out of bed. \nI\u2019m in a very similar situation (I quit my job due to workplace bullying that was affecting my mental and physical health) and am very lucky my partner is supportive and helpful and honestly it\u2019s helping a lot but sometimes I still struggle to get out of bed or be as proactive as I should because it just feels so overwhelming. If this is the case for her as well, I highly doubt she actually thinks it\u2019s okay and was just saying that as a defense so you\u2019d stop yelling.  \n\nI second gyuzzy\u2019s comment that you guys should have a calm conversation when you are not as emotional. First I would apologize for yelling at her (apologies lower defenses and increase the chance of her being vulnerable enough to tell you what is really going on), explain your concerns in a way that is not attacking her and comes from a place of love and support, tell her that her behavior concerned you and you\u2019re worried that she is struggling mentally and that you just didn\u2019t want her to have to struggle to find work again, and ask if there is anything you can do to help. Don\u2019t forget your own boundaries (she shouldn\u2019t *expect* you to provide financial support) and be honest about what you are and aren\u2019t willing to do but make it clear that it comes from wanting her to be the best version of herself she can be. Hopefully something like this will lead to a more honest and vulnerable conversation. \n\nOf course, there is always the chance that she just doesn\u2019t care and is entitled and spoiled but you won\u2019t know that until you really talk to her.

You\u2019re in a relationship, this is stuff you\u2019re supposed to deal with in a neutral, calm manner. Something I always say is to never let anger get the better of you, because you\u2019ll end up saying some hurtful things and whatever point you wanted to make gets lost.

It may sting, but maybe she has to lose her place and move back with her parents to wake up (literally and figuratively). \n\nTake it from me, I had a deadbeat husband.

The reason she said sounds bullshit. What kind of corruption can go on in a restaurant that would require fitting a chef?!\n\nNTA. I'd say you better run but you do you.

I knew I was gonna have a time frame, however brief, where I was NOT GETTING PAID because of it (training for the new job was 4wks, unpaid, with a bonus at the end which was still gonna be less than a real paycheck for like half a month for me). I worked my old job until the bitter end so I'd get those paychecks during my month of training, left deposit slips so my bf could go and manually deposit my checks mailed to our house, I had a strict $10 limit for any Christmas gifts I bought that year, etc etc etc. \n\nI very nearly pulled it off. My mom helped me out with like, $150. My partner was so dn impressed with me. I was so damn impressed with me. That was my biggest fear with changing jobs.
