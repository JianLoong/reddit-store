You did zero wrong", "NTA - you're co-workers, on a flight paid for by your company...there very little social obligation at this point, and certainly not enough to justify their attitude or unreasonable demands", "NTA!

Your flying first class didn't harm her in anyway whatsoever except to make her jealous. You did nothing wrong.

I travel a lot for work and have been lucky before to be bumped to first class. One time I was traveling with my boss and I got bumped to first class and left my boss in coach. It is luck and sometimes you need to just accept it.

Fair is somewhere to get cotton candy and play games.", "Well, I would have bc I have anxiety and I wouldn't want to fly alone.

She should\u2019ve been happy for you, instead, she chose to act like a petulant little baby.", "Idk, I guess it depends on the flight. I wouldn\u2019t tell my partner to reject the offer, but I would be probably be hoping to myself that he\u2019d sit with me.

I do sometimes save the chocolate for my husband or kid though lol", "> Seriously why are these people so co-dependent? \n\nReddit always makes me appreciate being such a hardcore introvert and skilled at occupying myself, because seriously so many Redditors can't be alone for more than 4 minutes without pouting, getting mad or having a panic attack and I just wonder how they manage in the world", "NTA. This is a crab bucket mentality where if she can't have it, no one should.", "NTA. Your co-worker is TA.", "NTA.  \n\nI got upgraded to business class when I was travelling with my boss.  I asked whether he could be upgraded too but they said it was full.  I did order his favourite alcohol and asked the air hostess to take it to him. He was very amused and raised the glass to me.  He was laughing when he told the passengers around him that I worked for him.  He is pretty senior in the company so hats off to him for his reaction.  He was a good boss.", "NTA, the only time you should be turning down an upgrade is if you're leaving a minor child in coach.", "NTA. Your spouse says this, maybe. Your co-worker? Hell no.", "NTA. She's just jealous. And no, she would not have given it up. I would encourage my co worker to take such a perk.

I traveled a LOT with coworkers and this happened frequently. Take the win! And we also never sat next to each other on a flight because no. I\u2019m going to see enough of them over the x many days we have to travel together.", "I am screaming NTA!! I travel for work and never in my 14 year career have I or any of my co-workers gotten upset for someone taking the first class seat.  If you get bumped then you\u2019re lucky and we\u2019re jealous! Never would I expect someone not to take it.  Because I travel so much I\u2019m in priority boarding and some of my newer co-workers are in the group that boards 3 or 4 groups after me.  I don\u2019t wait to board with them.  I just get on the plane.  This is so insane and your coworker is just mad she didn\u2019t get bumped but you did nothing wrong.  Who turns down first class?! NO ONE!!", "NTA-Both my coworkers got bumped to first, while I was in coach. They waved me past like a peasant when I boarded. We laughed about it.

Like coworkers might not want to sit next to each. Sure John to the left might be fine to have a cup of Joe with in the break room, not on the 8 hour flight with him snoring in his socks. While Martha to your right is fine to talk to about cats, but on the plan she's an anxious mess who takes everything you say negatively. \n\nSo yeah, for the sake of my employment it should honestly be standard practice NOT to book coworkers next to eachother.\n\nEdit: Well...John being in *just* his socks could be misleading .-.", "Seriously...coach with that middle seat empty is all the luxury I can imagine.", "I guess that depends on the age/maturity of the children. Also, leave a spouse with a small child, prepare to owe them big time", "haha sounds just like me and my friends", "I would totally offer it to my partner first and if they refused THEN take it. Cause either way I'm getting extra room", "I feel silly now, my reasoning for applauding (once, normally don't care) is relief - we had a 24 hour delay because of poor weather, then FURTHER delays that almost cancelled the flight \\*again\\*. Entire flight full of people were clapping when we finally landed esp. since for most the location meant it was a flight home, haha.", "I absolutely hate sitting next to strangers on a plane.

She said she was fine with it. You can't read her mind. If she later regretted it that was her problem, and she should have kept it to herself.", "Get out of town. Why would you reject a first class upgrade to hang out with a coworker? I've literally boarded the same flight as my *boss* and i got upgraded and she didn't. I assume it's because you travel more, booked earlier, or have the airline's credit card or some other nonsense. Doesn't matter. This is a coworker not a spouse. I was traveling for work the other day and hubs came with me (hey, a week in San Fran is a week in San Fran). I got offered an upgrade and he did not. He very rightly encouraged me to take it and I very rightly declined so we could sit together. Because we're *married*, not coworkers. If it had been just a colleague I would have snapped it up in a heartbeat!  ETA my verdict: NTA", "The part I hate about this is that you and your coworker were ever planning to sit together on a flight. I\u2019ve been on tons of flights with coworkers and I\u2019ve never sat with them. That sounds exhausting and awkward.", "NTA, at all. How absurd for her to expect you to give up a perk as if you owed her something!", "You flied by yourself too...\nNTA", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t flying by herself. She had a plane full of people to talk to in Coach. I\u2019m most certain that she would have taken the upgrade had it been offered to her rather than you. \n\nI hope you enjoyed first class.", "NTA even if my bf and I were flying together and I got bumped instead of him you bet I\u2019m taking first class and leaving him to be squished. He\u2019s be miffed but would do the same as me except I do fit better back there then him.", "Is there a reason you were expected to or supposed to sit with her?\n\nShe's not your spouse. She's not your family. You don't indicate that she's even your friend. She's just someone you work with.\n\nHopefully you enjoyed your flight and don't care what she thinks. I know I wouldn't.\n\nNTA", "She\u2019s your co-worker. Not your family, not your SO and not your bestie. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong and OF COURSE SHE would have opted to stayed in coach (with you) because she was never opted a bump in the first place!", "Personally when I fly I'm clutching the seat for dear life at take off and landing. I hate flying. My poor husband has to deal with me clutching his hand like it's a lifeline because of how much I hate flying. But I'd still understand if he took a first class spot and left me in coach.lol", "NTA.\n\nNo one would have refused an upgrade.\nIt\u2019s like refusing a lottery ticket because other people didn\u2019t win.", "NTA.  I traveled a lot with a group of consultants.  When one of us got bumped to first class, we took it.", "Nta", "NTA she should get over herself. And she ABSOLUTELY would\u2019ve taken first class if the roles were reversed.", "Nta\nCall her a jealous peasant every time she brings it up", "Love that analogy! I think we live in an age of consolation prizes and participation trophies!", "I just spent four weeks traveling for work and they went out of their way not to book us together. And when we all got to the airport, invariably we sat in different parts of the boarding area because we'd spent all week talking to each other and had had enough.", "NTA. She\u2019s your coworker not your child", "She's your co-worker not your husband. Of course you accepted the upgrade. NTA", "NTA and you have an entitled and jealous colleague my oh my", "LOL that old gal would have LEFT you standing there had it been offered to her.  NTA.", "NTA.  You don't owe the coworker your company for a flight.  I was once traveling with coworkers and one of them made a huge fuss to try to get the gate staff to upgrade her to business.  Not successful. As we entered the plane, I was approached and offered a business seat because someone wanted to swap seats so he could sit with his wife. I went off to business class while my colleague was reduced to mindless gibbering.", "Congratulations, you're NTA. Anyone decent in this situation would have been (or at least tried to be), happy for you.", "Right? This has actually happened to me and I definitely took the upgrade. My husband did not care, especially since I shared my (delicious) meal with him. It was a flight we both slept through mostly anyway!", "Yep my husband & I have both been upgraded without each other before. No one cares, just enjoy it while you can!", "Info: is this coworker a friend or merely a colleague", "Unless someone is fucking you (well) they have no business asking you to give up a first class seat. Even then they better have a good reason.\nNTA.", "I would\u2019ve 100% shared it with her. As in, you sit in first class half of the plane ride then you switch seats. The flight attendants shouldn\u2019t protest at that and it\u2019s not forbidden to change seats", "NTA", "NTA.... sure I might have felt some envy but I would not have wanted them to miss the opportunity.  (Unless I got a thoroughly unpleasant seat mate in the seat you gave up.;(", "NTA I don't understand this about OPs colleague. Is she an actual toddler or a differently abled person who cannot be separated from her caregiver? Or are they \"harmful toxins\" in First Class? (I'm being sarcastic here.)\n\nIf not, why this co-dependency? Why should OP not accept the upgrade?\n\nWhat the colleague would have done is immaterial.\n\nFor example, I would make an exorbitant amount of purchases if I receive a million dollars. Does that mean I am getting that money or that I can even dream of those purchases? No. Ridiculous.", ">If I was offered to upgrade but  I couldn't sit next to my SO, I probably wouldn't take it because I'd rather talk to him instead. It's a good way to pass the time, so yeah same", "I thought they outlawed child labor. Your coworker sounds like a huge baby and I don\u2019t believe for a second that she would have stayed with you in coach if she\u2019d been offered an upgrade. And even if she would, that\u2019s stupid. If she can\u2019t make it through a flight all by herself - like a big girl - I don\u2019t know how she manages a job or home life. I have a flight coming up where my husband and I aren\u2019t even sitting together because we didn\u2019t want to pay extra for seat selection. I think I\u2019ll live. She needs to get a grip. NTA.", "NTA - she is just jealous. I am too. It seems like a once in a lifetime opportunity. I've never even heard of this. I have flown many times but granted I always choose the cheapest airlines, I guess they don't do this.", "Oh please if it was me I would go straight to First Class no matter if you're my coworker you're my girlfriend or you're even my best friend the moment they say that I'm going to be upgraded to First Class out of the blue straight goodbye NTA", "NTA.\n\nEveryone should have an opportunity to fly first class especially if you don't have to pay for it.", "NTA. Also it\u2019s very likely that your coach seat would have already been re-assigned to a standby passenger.", "NTA. She should have been happy for you."]}
