You were on a business trip.  Anything that makes your life better on a business trip is yours to take.  You could have different status than her.  You could have a credit card she doesn't have.

Always take the upgrade.", "NTA. I've been abandoned on another continent by a colleague when our flight was cancelled. We still laugh about it sometimes.", "NTA. You were able to get jumped to first class. That\u2019s not something that happens a lot unless someone purposely flies first class. I would be jealous but really the coworker made a big deal out of nothing but jealousy.", "NTA. She absolutely would not have stayed in coach if she had been bumped. I hope you had a lovely flight.", "It makes sense if you're married or first-degree relatives - it's fair for my sister or spouse not to want to be on their own for hours, though I'd also hope they'd want me to take my good fortune and snag her some cookies or whatever).

She takes the ticket and enjoys herself while you kick yourself for being a pushover.", "NTA. I admit it's awkward, but them's the breaks. Also if you're in the US, the airlines have a complex and specific system for who gets upgraded it's not 'random' in any sense, if you were upgraded it's because you 'deserved' it from their perspective.

I've had situations when family members were bumped to business class on LONG flights and I got stuck in coach. You know what I did, I said WTF, HOW'd THAT HAPPEN???

But I would save the snacks and if the flight was long enough, swap with hubs for a bit too", "Lol, in my family my bro was often upgraded to business or first class because he traveled ALOT.

Though a couple of times he was kind enouch to switch seats with me :)", "Heck no!  NTA I\u2019m always happy for others getting a great unexpected opportunity.", "NTA. The coworker is not your lover or family to stay in couch for them. \n\nEven when that happens in my family the one(s) who got the upgrade  take it and bring back some  snacks  and drinks .", "NTA", "Nta you're co workers not a married couple.  When I fly, I read or watch on my phone. It's not like you were going to be interacting the whole flight.", "LOL what? My coworkers and I have always sat separately... you're already together all day at work, why do you need to sit next to each other on the flight?", "NTA. I\u2019ve flown with coworkers before and we don\u2019t even bother to align our seats. I\u2019ve definitely had one or the other of us get upgraded.

You did zero wrong", "NTA - you're co-workers, on a flight paid for by your company...there very little social obligation at this point, and certainly not enough to justify their attitude or unreasonable demands", "NTA! Places I have worked, we never sit together on planes. If one of us gets upgraded we congratulate them. Giving up your seat would be ridiculous.", "NTA \n\nI would have a hard time saying no if I was with my SO. Coworker? Pffft.

No way", "NTA    'She told me she would have stayed in coach if the roles were reversed'  I highly doubt that.  Your flying first class didn't harm her in anyway whatsoever except to make her jealous. You did nothing wrong. Turning down an opportunity to travel first class for no apparent reason would have been weird. Especially when she only told you she was upset afterwards. She expected you to be a mind reader?    Don't worry about it, you did nothing wrong, it's her problem not yours.", "NTA. I was in the same situation - got bumped to business on Air France from Paris to LA. I looked at my colleague, who said, \"Take it or I will.\"\n\nYou look at for yourself at let your colleague believe she would have sacrificed an upgrade just to sit next to you...lol.", "Nta. If I was traveling with my husband and I was bumped to first class, I would jump on that shit in a heartbeat. And I love him! A mere coworker? Hell no, they are fine in coach.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is an adult. She can manage to survive flying on her own. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were fine to accept the upgrade.", "NTA - a work trip with colleagues is not a vacation with your SO.

There is no rule of work travel etiquette that would require anyone to decline an upgrade.", "Unless you were planning on working during the flight - NTA", "NTA\n\nShe's not your spouse, or sibling, or friend.
