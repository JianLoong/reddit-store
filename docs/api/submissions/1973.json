You were on a business trip.  Anything that makes your life better on a business trip is yours to take.  You could have different status than her.  You could have a credit card she doesn't have.  You could have been in a seat that the last flight crew marked as broken and so they had to bump you.\n\nYour sister is wrong.  Your husband is right.

She's an adult, does she have an anxiety disorder of some sort in which she needs a companion (still wouldn't be your problem, but a consideration)?\n\nFourth, your sister is jealous so ignore her comment.\n\nYou're overthinking this.", "NTA.

You were able to get jumped to first class. That\u2019s not something that happens a lot unless someone purposely flies first class. I would be jealous but really the coworker made a big deal out of nothing but jealousy.", "NTA. She absolutely would not have stayed in coach if she had been bumped. I hope you had a lovely flight.", "It makes sense if you're married or first-degree relatives - it's fair for my sister or spouse not to want to be on their own for hours, though I'd also hope they'd want me to take my good fortune and snag her some cookies or whatever). You can't abandon your kid, even if they're sixteen. Other than that, all's fair in love and on airplanes haha."]}
