I also question whether she really would have stayed or if it\u2019s just a handy way of making you feel cruddy", "That's some bool-chit right there.\n\nHaving witnessed a melt down on an intercontinental flight a few weeks ago where the husband upgraded himself and left the wife in coach... your co worker is horrifically entitled and deserves ZERO leeway for this.\n\nA co worker is not a spouse or a family member.  You were on a business trip.  Anything that makes your life better on a business trip is yours to take.  You could have different status than her.  You could have a credit card she doesn't have.  You could have been in a seat that the last flight crew marked as broken and so they had to bump you.\n\nYour sister is wrong.  Your husband is right.  Your coworker owes YOU an apology for being entitled, not the other way around.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nFirst, it's a load of hooey for your co-worker to express what she would have done in the imaginary scenario she wasn't presented with.\n\nSecond, this is work, not a girl's trip. Was there as expected that you would be working together during the flight?\n\nThird, fly by herself?? She's an adult, does she have an anxiety disorder of some sort in which she needs a companion (still wouldn't be your problem, but a consideration)?\n\nFourth, your sister is jealous so ignore her comment.\n\nYou're overthinking this.", "NTA. Always take the upgrade.", "NTA. I've been abandoned on another continent by a colleague when our flight was cancelled. We still laugh about it sometimes.", "NTA. You were able to get jumped to first class. That\u2019s not something that happens a lot unless someone purposely flies first class. I would be jealous but really the coworker made a big deal out of nothing but jealousy.", "NTA. She absolutely would not have stayed in coach if she had been bumped. I hope you had a lovely flight.", "It makes sense if you're married or first-degree relatives - it's fair for my sister or spouse not to want to be on their own for hours, though I'd also hope they'd want me to take my good fortune and snag her some cookies or whatever). You can't abandon your kid, even if they're sixteen. Other than that, all's fair in love and on airplanes haha.", "NTA why wasn\u2019t your co-worker just happy for you? I would have high-fived a traveling companion that got bumped!", "NTA. What a stroke of good luck OP. You did nothing wrong.\n\nYour sister is an asshole though.", "I feel bad for Elaine but NTA. I hope that the supermodel that you sat next to, doesn\u2019t see you scratching your nose.", "No reason to feel guilty. She is a co-worker and I assume you were traveling on business not as friends on vacation. Hope you enjoyed the upgrade.", "ESH\n\nI would have declined 1st class and remained with my coworker. \n\nI also would not have had any hard feelings if my coworker took the opportunity.", "NTA", "NTA. Of course she said that because it wasn't her bumped. She would have totally taken it.", "NTA I bet if you would have said that you don't take the upgrade, your co-worker have right away voiced in \"then i take it!\". It is easy to say \"i would have...\" if it is just imaginary. \n\nYou are just co-workers. You don't need to sit together and cuddle during the flight. You either sleep, read or watch movies. So who cares who sit next to you. But first class, who doesn't want this offer?", "NTA\n\nI used to fly with coworkers all the time when I was a road warrior and it was pretty common for someone to be bumped up.  Enjoy it when it happens.", "NTA she absolutely would have taken first class", "NTA unless yall were planing on working on stuff , I guess, but thats your coworker not your friend or family that you're on this trip together. Its business. They're just jealous they didn't get bumped up either.", "NTA don't stress over it, and ignore her if she wants to be petty.", "She was going to take that bump, don\u2019t have any doubts about it. NTA", "No one is choosing coach over first class, her little \u201cI would\u2019ve done xyz for you\u201d is a load of bologna. NTA", "Lol! NTA - I\u2019m often sitting in different places than colleagues and often they are in business and first. No big deal and I\u2019m not gonna pout about it.", "NTA - you don't owe your coworker your traveling time.", "NTA, OP. You were visited by the upgrade fairy. It would be a waste to throw the unexpected gift back in her face. You owe your coworker *nothing*, you aren\u2019t her keeper, handler, or emotional support human.", "NTA\n\nyou are coworkers not in a relationship.  \n\nGetting bumped up rarely happens, so you jump if you get a chance.\n\nI bet you, she would have taken the seat in a heartbeat.\n\nI can see it now, you give up the seat, and then they call the next single person in line - your coworker.  She takes the ticket and enjoys herself while you kick yourself for being a pushover.", "NTA. I admit it's awkward, but them's the breaks. Also if you're in the US, the airlines have a complex and specific system for who gets upgraded it's not 'random' in any sense, if you were upgraded it's because you 'deserved' it from their perspective. It's a bit more informal outside the US, but you still probably had a slightly better status as a frequent flyer or something.", "Nta, if she would have stayed in couch then she wouldn\u2019t have made the statement \u201cI don\u2019t know why you got upgraded and not me.\u201d She\u2019s jealous and can get over it.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. I've had situations when family members were bumped to business class on LONG flights and I got stuck in coach. You know what I did, I said WTF, HOW'd THAT HAPPEN??? But then I sat myself down in economy.  I'm like why no one enjoy business class if one has the opportunity for it? NTA", "At my former job, the corporate travel department would not book seats together unless they were specifically requested. They said it was less drama in the long run, plus we would likely be spending a ton of time together anyway, so this was a way to give us a break. And while I admit I might be jealous if my coworker got upgraded and I did not, I certainly would encourage them to take it.", "i have a friend who travelled in first class while his girlfriend stayed in coach. weird right?", "I 100% agree with this. I'd have insisted my co-workers take first class. Also because I don't particularly like chatting while flying, so that would've been a nice way to ensure we weren't sitting together lol.", "Holy crap.  I would never do that to my wife.", "Multiple times when I was growing up, my family (of four, I'm the older of two) would go on a trip and get only two or three upgrades, and I'd tell the others to go for it. They did indeed bring me back delicious first-class snacks.", "Listen. I ADORE my husband and kids, but if I get offered a first class upgrade...I'm taking that sucker. But I would save the snacks and if the flight was long enough, swap with hubs for a bit too", "Lol, in my family my bro was often upgraded to business or first class because he traveled ALOT. Whenever I flew with him I got stuck in coach and didn't complain (well not much anyway), but never would have asked him to switch to economy. Though a couple of times he was kind enouch to switch seats with me :)"]}
