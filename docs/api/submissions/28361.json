I spoke to him first, telling him that I wasn't doing this in and out bs, and he better make sure he wanted to stay, because if he walked out I'm done and will be going for child support. He said that's fine and he wanted to be in their lives. So I talked to my kids, and they also wanted it. So I said fine. \nHe hung out with them 1-2 days A MONTH. That's it, which was fine, as long as he was consistent. After about 4 months he stopped texting me back, and reblocked me on everything. So I did what I said I was going too, and took him for child support. \nHis family was mad, and acted like I'm the person at fault and that their precious baby shouldn't have to take responsibility. \nWell our final court date was Wednesday, and I got my child support. \n    Yesterday, I ran into his dad, and he wanted to talk to me.

I used to give them a ride to school every morning, and I had them 4 days a month, even after I had to move 2 hours away for work.\n\nI'm not a stickler for marriage, but I think kids deserve to have 2 parents in their life if at all possible.  If not, then the money doesn't make up for it, but it doesn't hurt.  If you don't need it at all, stick it in their college fund.\n\nAt minimum, I consider child support a form of birth control.  IDK if the other kids are younger, but if so then maybe if he was already paying child support to you he'd have been more careful with the next person.  Fewer kids with absent parents is a goal.", "Oh hell to the NO are you TA!\n\nHe owes your children a financially stable life. You make the babies, you have to support them.

If he or his parents had an ounce of humanity in them, they would pay the child support gladly, knowing that it is there to help his children. But, considering that he has been a delinquent parent for a decade, I guess that has never occurred to him.

You and your kids have been minding your business for a decade, he wants to swoop in and play daddy. You said it yourself, he\u2019s been coddled too long.

I wish I never would have been forced to go to his house. He only saw me and my sister when it was convenient for him and that\u2019s not fair to children. Especially when they don\u2019t understand it makes them think they did something wrong.

You should value yourself more for what you have already done for your kids.", "NTA this is for your kids. Make him pay his end of it. He can control his actions.

The state is actually the one charging your partner for that child support, not you, and I can promise, whatever state you are in - they don\u2019t care about his circumstances at all. He has kids? He has to pay. He\u2019s on that birth certificate? Pay. Positive paternity test? Pay. \n\nSo, frankly, you don\u2019t even have the chance to be an asshole here. It\u2019s not your choice. Maybe he should\u2019ve been more careful.\n\nEdit to add: he is VERY lucky he doesn\u2019t have 10 years of back pay added to his account - which is what some states can do, or some people petition for.

What assurance do you have that he would continue and that it would be good for your kids. None. \n\nI disagree with you filing for support because he failed to follow through visiting the kids and also disagree with dropping it in exchange for grandpa taking them.

Why the emphasis? Because the money that gets paid as child support is not for you, it's for your child. Of course it's first and foremost to supply your child with food, clothes, toys, school supplies and hobbies. But even if you're able to supply all that by yourself (via the money you make, or via the support from other sources doesn't matter here), I absolutely guarantee you that your child will want to make use of that money, and even more important, _has a right to that money_. If you get by on your own - and don't get me wrong, that's great! - you file for child support anyway, and put that money away on a savings account and the whole sum goes to your child once they come of age. Whether they decide to spend it on college, their first car, a wedding or mortgage, the work & travel year they've dreamt of or on pokemon cards is your child's decision then. Currently, you're missing out on a huge sum of money that your child has a right to have. A quick calculation to explain: Imagine the child's other parent had paid only 50$ per month as child support since that child was born, for the past 10 years. 50x12 = 600$. 600x10 = 6000$ that your child is missing out on at this point - money that the child's father in this case _owes them_. \n\nIf child support for two kids is 700$, and we assume that it's evenly distributed, it means he owes _your child_ literally _350$ per month they have lived_. That amounts to 42k!! at this point, and will amount further to additional 33.600$ until they come of age. That's other people's study loan and more. That's a luxury car, or the mortgage for a house.\n\nGet a lawyer and see if you can get the past 10 years' worth of money out of him, and make sure he pays the full sum on time from now on until the child comes of age.
