His parents, never were, but his mother likes to play grandma of the year. \nLate last year he told the family member we do talk to he was wanting to make amends. I spoke to him first, telling him that I wasn't doing this in and out bs, and he better make sure he wanted to stay, because if he walked out I'm done and will be going for child support. He said that's fine and he wanted to be in their lives. So I talked to my kids, and they also wanted it. So I said fine. \nHe hung out with them 1-2 days A MONTH. That's it, which was fine, as long as he was consistent. After about 4 months he stopped texting me back, and reblocked me on everything. So I did what I said I was going too, and took him for child support. \nHis family was mad, and acted like I'm the person at fault and that their precious baby shouldn't have to take responsibility. \nWell our final court date was Wednesday, and I got my child support. \n    Yesterday, I ran into his dad, and he wanted to talk to me.

If not, then the money doesn't make up for it, but it doesn't hurt.  If you don't need it at all, stick it in their college fund.\n\nAt minimum, I consider child support a form of birth control.

I wish I never would have been forced to go to his house. He only saw me and my sister when it was convenient for him and that\u2019s not fair to children.

He has to pay. He\u2019s on that birth certificate? Pay. Positive paternity test? Pay. \n\nSo, frankly, you don\u2019t even have the chance to be an asshole here. It\u2019s not your choice. Maybe he should\u2019ve been more careful.\n\nEdit to add: he is VERY lucky he doesn\u2019t have 10 years of back pay added to his account - which is what some states can do, or some people petition for.

What assurance do you have that he would continue and that it would be good for your kids.

Why the emphasis? Because the money that gets paid as child support is not for you, it's for your child. Of course it's first and foremost to supply your child with food, clothes, toys, school supplies and hobbies. But even if you're able to supply all that by yourself (via the money you make, or via the support from other sources doesn't matter here), I absolutely guarantee you that your child will want to make use of that money, and even more important, _has a right to that money_. If you get by on your own - and don't get me wrong, that's great! - you file for child support anyway, and put that money away on a savings account and the whole sum goes to your child once they come of age. Whether they decide to spend it on college, their first car, a wedding or mortgage, the work & travel year they've dreamt of or on pokemon cards is your child's decision then. Currently, you're missing out on a huge sum of money that your child has a right to have. A quick calculation to explain: Imagine the child's other parent had paid only 50$ per month as child support since that child was born, for the past 10 years. 50x12 = 600$. 600x10 = 6000$ that your child is missing out on at this point - money that the child's father in this case _owes them_. \n\nIf child support for two kids is 700$, and we assume that it's evenly distributed, it means he owes _your child_ literally _350$ per month they have lived_. That amounts to 42k!! at this point, and will amount further to additional 33.600$ until they come of age. That's other people's study loan and more. That's a luxury car, or the mortgage for a house.\n\nGet a lawyer and see if you can get the past 10 years' worth of money out of him, and make sure he pays the full sum on time from now on until the child comes of age.

I went hungry a lot growing up and I still deal with food insecurity issues that resulted from that in my middle age.)", "So the grandpa wants you to drop child support because his son is a deadbeat, and is willing to to be generous enough to keep his grandkids 4 days a month.  Obviously mental illness runs in the family, because that\u2019s just insane. \n\nNTA", "NTA - He had the kids, he has to pay for them.  If he was dumb enough to have more kids, that is not your problem.", "NTA. Do not, ***do not*** drop your child support. Real life experience: For whatever besotted reason my mother chose not to pursue child support from my father. The entirety of my childhood was living on the edge of financial destruction. My mother worked two and sometimes three jobs to make enough money to support me and my brothers. \n\nThere was no health insurance, no life insurance, no extracurricular activities, few birthday parties, carefully chosen but few Christmas gifts, there just simply wasn't money for those things. She waited tables for a living and no matter what my mother went to work, because when she didn't there were no tips and no tips meant that she couldn't buy food for her children. There was just enough food for one day in our house most times. I saw my mother go without health care because she couldn't afford to be off her job or her kids did not eat. If he's making $2200 a month then you should be getting a percentage of that to care for your kids and I don't care how sad-eyed his parents want to be about it. They raised an irresponsible human being, but their lack of quality parenting doesn't mean that your kids should go without.", "Nta.  That money is to help your kids.  Help them right on to the luxuries in life or save for their college.  Drop it and the fil will immediately drop his end as well.", "NTA & see if you can get retro CS.", "Do not drop CS, that is for your children.  Tell his dad he can just help pay if he's so worried about it.  NTA.", "Nta , u should of filed sooner.", "NTA. He should have been paying child support the entire time, frankly you kinda did your kids a disservice not getting it earlier because he's pissing that money away on a frivolous life not dealing with his responsibilities. That money could have gone in a college fund or maybe a better school, whatever.\n\nRegardless, he should be paying child support AND being in his kids life, it shouldn't be either or and he's a poor father for not wanting to provide both.", "NTA\n\n> I'm not sure why I should drop my child support \n\nYou shouldn't. Honestly, you should have filed for child support from day 1. Sure, you may not have needed it, but it's not _for_ you, it's _for_ the children. And having some extra as a buffer (and school trips, and saving for college, and everything else) is a good thing.", "NTA. Stand firm.  And even if you're a people-pleaser, are you really dealing with anyone you could call a person, anyway? Make him support his kids!", "NTA for following through on the child support. But missing years of child support that those kids are entitled to because you\u2019re a people pleaser? That\u2019s not really a good thing.", "No. Don\u2019t drop it. They cost more than the time he \u201cmight\u201d see them anyway.\n\nYou have kids? You choose to be financially beholden to them til 18. \n\nOr longer in his parents case.\n\nSpoiled brat!", "YTA for not getting child support until now. If you didn't need it, the least you could do is put it into a savings or college fund when they're older.", "NTA!   And don\u2019t drop the support. You need that protection.  Children have 2 parents.  He\u2019s shirked his responsibility long enough.  His parents created this problem by covering his bills.  They can\u2019t afford to pay.  To bad.  Keep the support active.  And make sure the order is enforced by a state agency.", "NTA, he was warned about CS, played games & now gets to pay the piper, besides they are his kids.", "Repeat after me\u2026. \u201cThat\u2019s not my problem\u201d. He made choices, and he\u2019s had plenty enough time to get it together. You\u2019re job as a mom is to make sure your babies have everything they need, and are safe.  He\u2019s not there for them emotionally, physical, or mentally the least he can do is be there financially. You don\u2019t own anyone anything. You\u2019ve already been doing it all on your own.", "You are depriving your children by not making their dad pay you child support. You are depriving them of their mom and their time with you and their financial security.

People please your children, they're the ones that matter.", "NTA they are his kids and he has a financial responsibility to them even if he can\u2019t be bothered to be a present dad", "I worked for child support in my state for a little while. To ease your mind on being a people pleaser and against what his parents are saying the workers look at income for both parents, expenses, schools, medical, child care, etc. The calculations can get intense.  So they won't have made him pay in any unfair way. \n\nKids are expensive, if he gives the seed he should pay for the deed. \n\nAlso the minimum wage in my state is $7.25 /hr. When I worked at child support years ago,  working a full time minimum wage job the child support for 1 kid is $325 per month ... so $700 for three kids over 2 moms is so light weight. And if he really has hardships there are free appeal systems through the child support office and he just has to show proof it's affecting his rent/mortgage or legitimate bills. \n\nDo not let angry, inconsiderate irresponsible people make you feel you and your kids deserve less.", "OP is a people pleaser. So focus on pleasing those people who are your kids.", "Child support is for the kids. OP is denying her children.", "Bingo!", "If this asshole is mature enough to fuck without a condom he\u2019s mature enough to live with the consequences. NTA and fuck him and his parents.", "Came here to say this...", "They apparently told him, he just needs 50/50 custody so he doesn't have to pay me. LOL he couldn't even take him 1-2 days a month. Also, were in 2 states, albeit we are directly on state border, but that makes the whole school thing hard.", "All of this!!! Especially echoing: go after back pay. Most states allow that", "OP, he doesn't owe YOU child support, he owes HIS CHILDREN child support.", "New slogan for every condom box, either 5 bucks for this or 18 years of child support", "Agree. The irony - IRONY - of the dad who is paying most of his son's bills telling OP to drop child support is unbelievable. Dad is basically saying that even though they pay their son's bills that they don't want him to pay for his kids...", "That's a great idea I never thought of this.", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46", "Agreed. \n\nIf he didn\u2019t want kids he should have taken the necessary precautions. Kids do not ask to come here, we bring them here, it is our responsibility to care for them. \n\nI have zero tolerance and zero respect for sperm donors aka deadbeat dad\u2019s. He does not get a hall pass. He can sell his house and move back in with his parents, he can get a second job especially since he has so much free time on his hands because he does not spend time with his kids.\n\nAnd if you run into his Dad again and he makes the same ridiculous proposal, look him dead in the eyes and ask him if he is proud to have raised a deadbeat sperm donor! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNTA. Not by a long shot.", "I did file about 7 years ago, the previous state dropped the ball and I couldn't do anything about it. For the first 3 ish years it was less people pleasing and more scared they'd try to take them, because they tried to scare me with that and I was young and scared.", "Sometimes I think for piece of mind is better than money for people who have that option.", "Period", "We thankfully are okay not well off, but we are comfortable, but it would be nice to have that money for a nice Christmas cause they're getting to the stage they want big expensive things, and they do sports and orchestra, and itd be nice to have the help.", "I understand the sentiment but this is not true. Child support is owed to the custodial parent to compensate them for a portion of the expense that they have caring for the child. It is definitely intended to be for the benefit of the child, but it is owed to the parent.", "Actually in the US this does nothing. Judge will not take him off of support even if he gives up any rights.", "Having been in OPs place I will give my answer.\n\nMy child's father would show up in their life at certain times.  \nWhen they had a new girlfriend they wanted to impress as a \"good dad.\"  \nRight before filing taxes every few years so he could try to claim her.   \nEtc etc.\n\nHe never had any custody, and eventually lost his visitation rights after having a bad experience in front of her, then never showing up at court when I wanted to change the visits to supervised. (the supervision would have been his own mom)\n\nI fully believed she should know that side of her family, and took her to see his parents & his brother & his wife.
