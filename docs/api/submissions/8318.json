The ring wasn\u2019t willed to anyone nor did she verbally say who she wanted the rings to go to (as far as I\u2019m aware) but my uncle thought that he had it because he was the oldest brother.

Over Covid lockdowns we were having a clear out to see what we could donate to charity shops and we found the rings with some of my grandmas other stuff in the attic. I asked my dad if he could have the engagement ring because I think it\u2019s pretty (emerald and diamond). I paid to have the ring cleaned, re-plated, and have the settings checked. I now wear the ring fairly regularly because since starting my career after uni I\u2019ve started to wear more jewellery because it think it\u2019s a simple way of looking more put together and polished.

Over the weekend Becky had her engagement party, I wore the ring not thinking much of it because it went with what I was wearing (green velvet jump suit). Of course Becky and my uncle recognised the ring right away accusing my dad of stealing from under them when my grandma died (he was there first and my parents did the majority of the packing cos she lived closer to us) and accusing me of wearing it just to spite them and telling me that I ruined the evening and demanding that I give the ring over. I told them I didn\u2019t know they were looking for the ring and if they had mentioned it to me or my parents we could have told them I had the ring.

Just because your aunt doesn't have children and doesn't have plans to get married doesn't mean she has no right to have memento of her mother, by the way--getting married is not the sole determinant of a woman's value or place in the family, and as you yourself has demonstrated, you don't need to be married or engaged to wear a ring. The siblings could have collectively agree to follow the pattern established by the previous two generations (whatever that was), or decide that the ring is passed down mother to daughter, and give it back to your aunt, who could then decide what to do with it, or you could agree it goes to the oldest child, or the first grandchild to get engaged who wants it, etc., but they should have decided it together, and it's shady that your dad basically just took it. \"Finders keepers\" is not usually how this sort of thing gets decided.", "ESH.

When there isn't a will present to distribute an estate, your dad and all his siblings were equally entitled, so all contents of the estate (including the rings) should've been cataloged and appraised, and then those items should be distributed evenly according to their values. If your dad removed those rings (which I'm assuming carry a high monetary value) without notifying the rest, he could be sued by his brother. None of this is your fault, but depending on how badly your uncle wants that ring, things could get messy.", "NTA but your father, aunt and uncle need to reach a decision on this as there was no will.

No one just took anything and did you know they were looking for the ring? I actually found my grandparent\u2019s wedding rings and I told people immediately when I did and their children discussed who would get them and they came to a decision together.

Sorry but finders keepers isn\u2019t the way to go here.", "NTA because your father gave you the rings. I am concerned that the rings were not his to give. Usually jewelry is sorted and dispersed at the time of the will along with any other inheritances. But not sure anyone could claim it at this point.", "ESH no one really has a right to the ring. If she died without a will, technically the ring should have been sold and assets divided according to local inheritance laws.

Your uncle just assumed he had it when he should have checked. From your post, it appears at least your dad and his brother both knew what the ring looked like, what it signified and how it was intended to be used, but your dad didn't say anything when you guys found it, he just let you have it and use it as regular every day jewelry.

You are very dismissive of your aunt here. It doesn't matter that she's not married or doesn't have kids. She is your grandmother's only daughter and has way more of a connection to her than you do. She deserved a say.\n\nSo your dad should have at least told your aunt before giving the ring to you. He should have told both siblings and is far more in the wrong here.", "Legally I think you are likely in the clear since I believe possession here determines who gets to keep the ring.  Because it was not willed to anyone in particular you are just as entitled to it as your cousin.  However if your Uncle wanted to pursue it you may have to pay 50% of what the ring is worth less the money you\u2019ve spent on it.  I\u2019m not an estate lawyer though, only anecdotal through my own experience.\n\nHowever morally it\u2019s more ambiguous.  Technically yes, you have just as much right to the ring, and there is nothing wrong with asking for it and wearing it.  It wasn\u2019t up to you to determine where your grandmothers things ended up.  Your dad, on the other hand, should have spoken to his brother before just letting you keep such a valuable heirloom.  He is definitely in the wrong IMO.  \n\nYour uncle is also in the wrong for attempting to do the exact same thing your father did.  He should have talked to your father, his brother, before unilaterally gifting the ring to your cousin.  It was no more his to give away than it was your dads.  Now, your uncles claim may be that his daughter, your cousin, was the first to get engaged.  It\u2019s a valid claim.  It would also be valid to say that the ring should go to the eldest granddaughter.  Also your aunt has a valid claim on the ring- it was her mothers.  Just because she has no plans on getting married doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t wear the ring.  After all, *you\u2019re* wearing it.  \n\nSo I guess what I think is the fair thing is to give it to the aunt.  She can either decide to keep it and wear it and will it to a niece or great niece or she can gift it to whomever she wants.  If you just decide to keep it you are going to really poison the family pot, so you need to decide if that is worth it to you.  \n\nESH", "You have the ring. It's yours.

You have it because you cherish it. They want it because they feel entitled.", "NTA If the ring was actually important and he planned on passing it down to his daughter, he shouldn\u2019t have gone 19 years without checking its location or laying eyes on it. It sounds more like he randomly remembered the ring when his daughter got engaged and wanted it more for the gesture of passing down an \u201cheirloom\u201d rather than actually caring about the ring. He just wanted it for the optics, but the ring itself doesn\u2019t sound particularly sentimental. \n\nWhen heirlooms are actually important and sentimental, you don\u2019t just forget where they\u2019re located and *assume* it ended up with you. You ask about it, make sure you find it after the persons passing, and keep it somewhere safe. He didn\u2019t care about his moms ring.

Nothing was said about grandma's estate for 19 years, while her \"stuff,\" some of it, was stored in your attic after your dad cleaned her house out when she died. Your dad forgot it was there, your uncle never talked about it, so there was no reason to think he would care. At this point, it is possible your uncle could make claim that he is owed half the value as the ring could be considered part of your grandmother's estate, but it doesn't follow that he gets the ring. It could mean you pay him half the value of the ring, possibly minus the amount you spent to restore it, but unless there has been some accounting of the full estate, what other valuables were there, and who got them, I don't see how this would work.

If it went missing people in my family would care but I wouldn't consider myself a narcissist for not checking up on the ring every time I go over to my mom's house.  I probably wouldn't announce it to my whole family if I couldn't find it. We don't know how close the brothers are.  It's just a ring.

His own argument is that he intended to do exactly what he is claiming his brother did but that he's owed it simply by dint of having been born first.  I don't think that gives him any moral high ground claim to the ring.\n\nShould the ownership of the ring have been discussed when the house was being cleaned?  Certainly.  But since both tried to claim the ring without informing the other, it seems to me that it should probably go to the one that did the most work clearing the house as they earned it through sweat equity.", "Honestly, I think the fact that the uncle never actually had the ring is interesting. I wonder if he was well aware he never actually was given the wrong and trying to quietly pass it on, but those plans went up in smoke cause your dad found it first. If he had been given the ring, it wouldn't have been with your grandma's things still, and if there was a verbal agreement the people involved were idiots not to either write it down or move the property", "I wasn\u2019t really responding to the OP but the idea that the aunt should get all the jewelry because she\u2019s the only daughter.", "OPs uncle can\u2019t have cared too much if he never confirmed he had possession of it.

I got one piece of costume jewelry, and that was it. My dad, who was so good to her didn\u2019t really get much because of this. If they had put some stuff away in storage, and my dad came across something valuable but unclaimed, I could see him just quietly giving it to me or my mom since Aunt already got so much and refused to give anything up.

His intent to do that 19 years ago doesn't give him a claim to it now.  And uncle simple wanting it doesnt entitle him to it, then or now. \n\nWhether uncle thought he had the ring this whole time is irrelevant.  He doesn't get it now just because, and OP/dad had no moral or ethical obligation to hand it over because of arbitrary rites.", "Chances are the siblings 19 years ago all went to grandma's house and started splitting everything up, and no one realized the ring was in the stuff op's father took.  I don't think anything was \"plundered\" because it sat in storage for 17 years until covid cleaning. I think it's a nah situation,  but if I were op I would certainly not give it up now that she put money into it unless she recovered her investment + her father's share of its value.", "You don't get to plunder everything but if you are the one dealing with the estate of the deceased then you should be entitled to more than the siblings that don't help at all because otherwise you are expecting a person to do weeks if not months of work and effort to make sure all the legal paperwork has been completed with the gov and the bank and everything is done right just to equally split the stuff with people who didn't help with the stuff in the first place? The young brother got the ring because he put in time and effort with the estate when big bro didn't. Should everyone been informed of the ring yes but if the siblings helped with the estate before or after the will then they would probably have known about the ring.

He should gave told his brother as soon as he found the ring - whether that was last week or 19 years ago. It belongs to both of them.

My parents did most of the packing because we were geographically closer to where my grandma lived at the time of her death. So my parents could pop over to do the packing in the evening after work, and my uncle joined them on the week end. From what I have been told all parties agreed to this. She was living in assisted living so they needed the flat for the next tenant so they only had 2 weeks to clear the flat. My uncle lived a couple of hours away (still does) and my aunt was living and working abroad at the time so wasn\u2019t in the country.\n\nSo the parents did most of the packing because they lived closer, uncle came down on the weekends, aunt didn't help because she was in another country. She hasn't mentioned the scope in which uncle was helping - maybe he was micromanaging or sitting on his ass, we don't know, but it seems like he was helping in some regard.", "They were basically saying that you were attacking their character instead of their argument, but I think the rest of us agree that calling ops dad \"daddy dearest\" is weird and they're projecting.", "Yeah, uncle hasn\u2019t missed the ring, or asked about it in 19 years until his daughter got engaged. Doesn\u2019t seem like they gave it much thought either way until this proposal came up. I do believe that things like this should be discussed and divided among siblings if they aren\u2019t specified in the will. However, it seems that OP\u2019s dad did the majority of work when it came to dispersing the personal property, and that his sister (who didn\u2019t plan to marry didn\u2019t want the ring), and the uncle hasn\u2019t even mentioned the ring in 19 years.

Now, if the family agreed the fee would be keeping certain valuable/sentimental items, that would be different. But it doesn't sound like that was the case for OP's family. \n\nEstates are not something to mess around with - the safest thing is to follow the letter of the law, and even then, you have to hope no one feels slighted. I've witnessed more than one messy estate, including several instances of family being torn apart - including being cut off from a few family members myself after I accidentally got entangled in a mess for a non-mutual relatives estate (Think OP being given something after the fact).

If my parents had just died I really wouldn't give a shit about the price tag, neither my sister nor myself would sell an heirloom so it wouldn't matter.  I can easily see this happening too.    My mom has pretty much divided everything up between us already just by asking us but I doubt she's put down in her will who is getting what jewelry or furniture or whatever, she probably expects that we can work that out for ourselves.  I mean do people seriously list out every single belonging they have over a couple hundred dollars?  \n\nIncidentally my grandma divided her stuff pretty much the same way and we had no conflicts, only she always had us put a note on something if we wanted it.

Luckily, my personal experience was pretty smooth with little conflict.\n\nBeing an executor is much different from being \"someone who cleans out the house of the deceased\".   An estate does not necessarily have to go through the probate process.  It depends on the laws of your state and there are written guidelines to help you figure it out.  The executor is named in the Will of the deceased or appointed by the Probate Court.  Generally speaking, an executor is paid a percentage of the money coming into and out of the estate, from bills paid and items sold.\n\nFrom what I've seen, a Will MAY list individual items to be given to certain people, it may also just instruct that everything be divided equally or in some other way amongst the heirs/beneficiaries.  The person handling the estate can make a detailed list of items with estimated values and the beneficiaries/heirs can indicate what items they are interested in.  If no one wants a particular item, it can be sold and the money divided.  If more than one person wants an item, then some negotiating must occur.\n\nWhile the OP's dad may have been an AH by taking the rings, his brother is the AH for just assuming the rings belonged to him.  Neither of them handled the issue properly.   And for this spat to occur almost twenty years after Grandma's death is absurd.\n\nOP is NTA in any way, shape, or form.", "Then I guess the dad's an idiot for even working on the estate in the first place but I guess your right I just would never do that then. It doesn't sound worth it to do that job", "I said he should have informed brother of finding tbe ring, not given it to him. Reading is your friend.\n\n\nThen they decide together who gets it and if they can't agree it gets sold and they split profits.", "For my dad's we are going through probate as he didnt have a will. When you start probate you have to notify of the death and show that you made your best effort to contact heirs and anyone they might owe a debt to. From that notification there is a timeline (i want to say 4-6 months) someone has to make a claim/contest etc. The estate is valued and split between heirs. For us, my mom gets 50% (legally separated, not divorced) and then the other 50% is split between my sisters and me. Things like his motor home and car have to be sold or if someone wants them, they get the value counted towards their portion. Now take this all with a grain of salt, as rules for this change state by state and country by country. You would have to look up your area if someone can make a claim over a decade later. I think they would have to prove that it was purposefully withheld or proper notification of death/estate items weren't made.", "> The uncle just assumed he had the ring so clearly he never discussed it either, but he\u2019s entitled to it?\n\nTheir comment doesn't say that. Only that proper procedure was not followed.", "I highly doubt this person is a accredited as they are portraying here.", "This wouldn\u2019t be settled in a criminal court. \n\nIt would be settled in a civil court - possibly small claims - no lawyers needed. \n\nInheritance theft isn\u2019t quite like other theft, but OPs dad *did* inappropriately take possession of the item, and *did* permanently deprive someone of the asset. Proofs in the pudding. \n\nNot that it matters, apparently OP has an aunt (GM\u2019s daughter) and the ring *should* probably have gone to her in the first place.\n\nBut, again, OPs dad is a thief, whether he took the jewelry with intent or failed to disclose it when the ring was found.\n\nYou can disagree all you like. It\u2019s not going to change my opinion on the matter."]}
