The ring wasn\u2019t willed to anyone nor did she verbally say who she wanted the rings to go to (as far as I\u2019m aware) but my uncle thought that he had it because he was the oldest brother. Any way it turns out that after my grandma died in the process of clearing out her flat and stuff my dad ended up with the her engagement ring and wedding band. Over Covid lockdowns we were having a clear out to see what we could donate to charity shops and we found the rings with some of my grandmas other stuff in the attic. I asked my dad if he could have the engagement ring because I think it\u2019s pretty (emerald and diamond). I paid to have the ring cleaned, re-plated, and have the settings checked. I now wear the ring fairly regularly because since starting my career after uni I\u2019ve started to wear more jewellery because it think it\u2019s a simple way of looking more put together and polished.

Over the weekend Becky had her engagement party, I wore the ring not thinking much of it because it went with what I was wearing (green velvet jump suit). Of course Becky and my uncle recognised the ring right away accusing my dad of stealing from under them when my grandma died (he was there first and my parents did the majority of the packing cos she lived closer to us) and accusing me of wearing it just to spite them and telling me that I ruined the evening and demanding that I give the ring over. I told them I didn\u2019t know they were looking for the ring and if they had mentioned it to me or my parents we could have told them I had the ring. I don\u2019t want to give her the ring because I consider it my ring (it ended up with my dad and he gave it to me); I paid for it to be resized/cleaned/re-plated/settings fixed; it\u2019s my favourite/most worn piece of jewellery (because I like how it looks and the sentimental value of it being my grandmas because I don\u2019t really remember her so it helps me feel connected to her); and my Grandma expressed no preference to who the ring went to.

So I completely understand why your uncle is upset and feels slighted. \n\nIn general when there is no will, and no clear directive on who gets what, the valuables get itemized and divided between the heirs with some horse trading.

Just because your aunt doesn't have children and doesn't have plans to get married doesn't mean she has no right to have memento of her mother, by the way--getting married is not the sole determinant of a woman's value or place in the family, and as you yourself has demonstrated, you don't need to be married or engaged to wear a ring. The siblings could have collectively agree to follow the pattern established by the previous two generations (whatever that was), or decide that the ring is passed down mother to daughter, and give it back to your aunt, who could then decide what to do with it, or you could agree it goes to the oldest child, or the first grandchild to get engaged who wants it, etc., but they should have decided it together, and it's shady that your dad basically just took it. \"Finders keepers\" is not usually how this sort of thing gets decided.", "ESH.

When there isn't a will present to distribute an estate, your dad and all his siblings were equally entitled, so all contents of the estate (including the rings) should've been cataloged and appraised, and then those items should be distributed evenly according to their values. If your dad removed those rings (which I'm assuming carry a high monetary value) without notifying the rest, he could be sued by his brother. None of this is your fault, but depending on how badly your uncle wants that ring, things could get messy.", "NTA but your father, aunt and uncle need to reach a decision on this as there was no will.

No one just took anything and did you know they were looking for the ring? I actually found my grandparent\u2019s wedding rings and I told people immediately when I did and their children discussed who would get them and they came to a decision together. So there were things I would have liked to have that other people got, it\u2019s the way this stuff works out. Sorry but finders keepers isn\u2019t the way to go here.", "NTA because your father gave you the rings. I am concerned that the rings were not his to give. Usually jewelry is sorted and dispersed at the time of the will along with any other inheritances. But not sure anyone could claim it at this point.", "ESH no one really has a right to the ring. If she died without a will, technically the ring should have been sold and assets divided according to local inheritance laws.

Your uncle just assumed he had it when he should have checked. From your post, it appears at least your dad and his brother both knew what the ring looked like, what it signified and how it was intended to be used, but your dad didn't say anything when you guys found it, he just let you have it and use it as regular every day jewelry. Now you have put time and money into it as an individual piece rather than a family heirloom which isn't really an AH move, you didn't know what was up, but basically ends the tradition, which is apparently sad for the rest of the family.\n\nI like the compromise forming about using the wedding bands in some way, but is there any further option?
