When Becky\u2019s Fianc\u00e9 asked my uncle\u2019s permission my uncle offered my Grandmas engagement ring (she died when were 3) because he thought that he had the ring. The ring had already passed through 2 generations to get to my grandmother so he wanted to continue the tradition. The ring wasn\u2019t willed to anyone nor did she verbally say who she wanted the rings to go to (as far as I\u2019m aware) but my uncle thought that he had it because he was the oldest brother. Any way it turns out that after my grandma died in the process of clearing out her flat and stuff my dad ended up with the her engagement ring and wedding band. Over Covid lockdowns we were having a clear out to see what we could donate to charity shops and we found the rings with some of my grandmas other stuff in the attic. I asked my dad if he could have the engagement ring because I think it\u2019s pretty (emerald and diamond). I paid to have the ring cleaned, re-plated, and have the settings checked. I now wear the ring fairly regularly because since starting my career after uni I\u2019ve started to wear more jewellery because it think it\u2019s a simple way of looking more put together and polished. My uncle, aunt and cousin (we\u2019re both only children) have been hunting around their house for the rings since late October and Becky\u2019s fianc\u00e9 proposed with some costume jewellery. My parents and I didn\u2019t know about any of this at the time. Over the weekend Becky had her engagement party, I wore the ring not thinking much of it because it went with what I was wearing (green velvet jump suit). Of course Becky and my uncle recognised the ring right away accusing my dad of stealing from under them when my grandma died (he was there first and my parents did the majority of the packing cos she lived closer to us) and accusing me of wearing it just to spite them and telling me that I ruined the evening and demanding that I give the ring over. I told them I didn\u2019t know they were looking for the ring and if they had mentioned it to me or my parents we could have told them I had the ring. I don\u2019t want to give her the ring because I consider it my ring (it ended up with my dad and he gave it to me); I paid for it to be resized/cleaned/re-plated/settings fixed; it\u2019s my favourite/most worn piece of jewellery (because I like how it looks and the sentimental value of it being my grandmas because I don\u2019t really remember her so it helps me feel connected to her); and my Grandma expressed no preference to who the ring went to. They argue that Becky should get the ring because she\u2019s the daughter of the eldest son (my aunt is the only girl and currently has no children or plans to get married) and Becky got engaged first so she should get the ring for that.", "created_utc": 1674738776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lrhpz/aita_for_not_giving_my_newly_engaged_cousin_my/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't just get to claim it for yourself. Plus, integrity is a thing.\n\nWhen my grandpa died, my mum was the first one in his home. While sorting his stuff, she came across a golden bracelet she'd never seen before, it turned out to be rather expensive(massive gold). For about a week, she called me every day to discuss what to do with it. She could keep it, her sister would never know, and she was already going to take a hit in the division of the estate. After some daydreaming about just selling it and keep the proceeds(very strained relationships all around), she added it to the rest of the jewelry. Because she's just too honest to steal from her sibling.\n\nOp's father is not some lucky guy who found a ring. He stole a family heirloom(two, actually, he took the engagement ring AND the wedding band) and hoped nobody would find out. He'd have gotten away with it, if OP hadn't worn it in front of the very people he stole it from.", "We found both Grandmas and Gandpas wedding bands at the same time that I got cleaned and replated at the same time.
