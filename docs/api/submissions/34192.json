{"id": 34192, "submission_id": "18wvaeb", "title": "AITA for refusing to let my boyfriends kids in my room?", "selftext": "Been with my BF for 3 years. Was introduced to his 3 children 6 months or so ago. Great kids but all of them lack boundaries and it's obviously a parental issue more so than their issue. They are 13(male), 12(female) and 8(male). The 2 younger ones have ADHD as well and are off the walls 24/7.\n\nWe started doing weekend sleepovers 2 months ago and it's honestly been hell. For no other reason outside of the fact that I literally have zero space to decompress because the kids follow you everywhere you go. They have no clue how to entertain themselves. Given that they are literal children, I don't blame them. But my one hard limit is the kids being in my room. I don't like anyone in my bedroom. That's my private space. But there have been multiple times when I have been in the bedroom and one or all of the kids will come in and just take over my bed completely. Laying down with their tablets. Or if I'm watching TV in there, more often than not they will come in and take over my TV or just talk 24/7 so I can't focus on anything other than them and their questions. Despite the fact that usually when I do watch TV in my room, it's because they have taken over the TV in the living room and there's no place to sit. I've told my BF I don't want anyone in my room and that it makes me uncomfortable but it's almost as if he thinks it doesn't apply to his children because just days after telling him this, him and I were watching a movie around 7pm (when the kids have their downtime and had a movie on for themselves in the living room) and all of his kids came in to my room and immediately climbed in to my bed so I was stuck in a 2ft square in my own space because I couldn't move otherwise. That and they bring their tablets with them. So I'm trying to watch a movie and all 3 of them have their tablets on my bed with the volume up and I have never been so overstimulated in my life. And it happens all the time. If we are in my room, they are too. If we are in the kitchen, they follow us. If we go outside, they are right behind us (but we can't get them to go outdoors by themselves).\n\nYesterday I had a terrible day (family stuff). My BF had his kids over and I was just needing space away from their chaos. I said I was going to my bedroom to get time alone. BF comes in maybe 20 minutes later to check on me and not even 2 minutes following that, his kids are in my room and on my bed. The youngest doing flips and moving the bed from the wall. I told them to get out 6 times before they actually listened. My BF said they just want to be around us and I said I don't care. My bedroom is off limits from this point forward. He said he doesn't think he can do that because he enjoys having his kids near him and doesn't want to shut them out and asked me to reconsider or \"make a schedule\" of when they could be in my room with us. I refuse. He says I'm being unreasonable and that by being with a single parent, I need to learn compromise.\n\nETA: I'm 30. He's 32. The only issue I have is with the kids being in my bedroom. I don't hide away in there or anything like that (kinda sounded like that in the post due to poor wording). I usually only slip away to my bedroom between 6-7pm but they almost immediately follow me because their dad does. Admittedly, if they would just sit down and not do flips or jump on my bed or shift the bed away from the wall or even wipe their feet before getting in to my bed, I would probably be willing to compromise. However, they've been told several times that my bed is not a jungle gym and to stop jumping/doing front flips. The youngest does not listen at all because of the overwhelming amount of energy he has. He is constantly doing flips over everything- not just my bed. Not a single one of them wipe their feet so there's constantly dirt and when I remind them, it's met with a \"sorry, I forgot\" and then still don't wipe their feet. They're great kids. I get along with them really well. But it doesn't change the fact that my space is disrespected and they have no business being in my bedroom. We do not live together. This is happening at my home. He has been bringing the kids to my house every other weekend because we have been tiptoeing around the idea of moving in together.

Acting this out like this, afraid to go outside? ADHD isn't an excuse, I've been tired for years of hearing about this being the problem with kids that act out. Parent them ffs. They're literally being raised by tablets.\n\nI digress.\n\nMoving in together is not going to work, nor is this relationship. The kids have no respect for you and I doubt they ever will, they treat you like a sibling or play thing. \"Thanks but no thanks\" and a clean break. I sincerely doubt you are willing to parent them. You're not the asshole for not being willing to compromise. \n\nHowever, YTA for dating for 3 years and just now bothering to get to know the kids. In spite of how frustrating this story is to read for you, I feel bad for dad here. I don't think you were on board to begin with.\n\nEdit: It's 100% on OP for not meeting the kids for 3 years. That's wild. Who would honestly stay in a relationship that long with three mystery kids?? \"He didn't bring them around\"? Give me a break Reddit!", "Nta, kids should have boundaries and not be able to do what they want. But I dont think you and your bf are compatible, based on his reaction. \n\nIf they HAVE to be in the room with their tablets, couldnt they at least use headphones so youre not overstimulated?\n\nIts wild to me how people say this comes with kids, but growing up with 3 siblings, we understood privacy. We werent allowed in our parents bedroom without their permission.  We respected each others space. This was in the 90s. I dont understand what has happened since that most parents say \u201cthey just burst in\u201d and they go wherever, and theres no such thing as privacy. Im not saying shut away, but they should know if youre not feeling good mentally, you need time alone to decompress. \n\n\nWhy are people raising their kids to do whatever they want with no boundaries? Thats not how the real world works. Boundaries exist. Create them and utilize them.", "NTA - my parents never wanted us (5 kids) in their room growing up. It\u2019s beyond reasonable to have a boundary around your privacy; have you talked to the kids about it? I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t want you interfering with their privacy either.", "No rating. You sound a lil nuts, thinking youd have solo time when family visits. Especially if you retreat to your room and for some reason, believe no one in the house will look for you. Youre treating these kids like baggage. Having adhd has nothing to do with the attention seeking. You spend all your time with them when theyre there. Freaking learn! Alone time is when theyre asleep, thats it. Regardless of age. Sometimes after dinner, depending on routines (homework, sports, separate tv rooms, etc. but thats an hour or two max) try planning an entire weekend WITH THEM. And you can try sending them to a candy store w some $ or invite them to bring their bikes to go on a ride without you if you need an hour solo (dad can join them cycling). But yes, having kids or many kids, a weekend together is a weekend TOGETHER. Its a ton of logistics on their side - maintaining laundry and org for the following week and taking the weekend to see you at home. Like premake some cookies and have a decorating party together - each get a tub to take home. The premaking prevents any mess of baking together. The decor part is also social. Having a vote on 2 movies, one u all watch together in the bed, and the second the kids watch in the living room following it. Adults optional. Just make your bedroom no boys allowed. Until further notice. If youre really expecting to have solo movie time each day. There are nature scavenger hunt lists you can find online. And have them go outdoors and do it. Prize can be ya make a center piece with it all etc. a wreath, something that decorates the place and they can see a part of the family in ur place. Ipads dont really count as spending time together even if ur all piled together doing it.", "NTA. Setting boundaries is heathy and necessary for all children. It doesn't matter if they're your own kids or your partner's kids. They have to learn respect for other people's physical and emotional sovereignty. \n\nYour boyfriend is TA here. You may be irreparably incompatible due to this. He refuses to take ownership of his responsibilities of parenting his children. He refuses to respect your needs. That's certainly not someone I would want to be with.", "You're NTA, but neither is he. If he wants to compromise, he should stay in the living room with them while you go into your own room. And he can get you a lock. But his feelings are as valid as yours, he obviously doesn't want you to be locked away, but if it's only for an hour then he should be able to spend an hour without you. You don't have kids and you have had all this time and space to yourself, now his children are coming over, taking over the place and going nuts, and it is probably an adjustment for you. At the same time, he loves you and his kids and wants to spend time with all of you and relax. There are different ways of resolving this, you just have to decide what is the least stressful way in the long run. If you love him and are otherwise happy in your relationship, this is likely something you will have to get used to at some stage. But if it's not for you, you can always find someone who is just as great minus the kids.", "I work part time from home so when my kids were young was with them 24/7 in the summer.  I remember getting so over stimulated, I'd go upstairs to our room to just ger some alone time.  Within 10 minutes they would have all followed me up there, and would all be on the bed..  My husband would be downstairs--alone.  But I never told them to leave...I mean, they wanted to be with me, right?  I am their mom.   Now the older two are away at college and I am lucky if I get to talk to them once a week!\n\nI don't think you are the AH, but if you are getting that over stimulated from a weekend visit I think you need to really consider whether this is the relationship for you.  I mean what if something changed and your boyfriend had to have them all the time?  What would that be like for you?", "Changing to NTA with the new information that this is YOUR house not a shared one. He\u2019s right that if you\u2019re serious with someone who has kids, you\u2019re going to need to compromise (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s his bedroom too?). But he\u2019s also not asking you to compromise, he\u2019s asking you to completely sacrifice your bedroom as a personal space. \n\nYou two are not compatible. Time to move on.", "So they have a room of their own? Make it so they are on the floor only. Get them headphones so you done hear the tablets. Tell your BF you need an hour to YOURSELF and he has to stick to it! Demand boundaries! I get it we all need alone time.", "You've been with your boyfriend for 3 years and only met his children 6 months ago? What?", "NTA. your compromise as a non-parent is agreeing to let them stay in your home. they dont need to be harassing you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand letting someone who isn\u2019t the couple into their bedroom. Kids always get the whole damn house/apartment, why can\u2019t the person who pays for it get 100 sqft to themselves???", "NTA. But don't be a doormat. He's refusing to hear you. He's constantly disrespecting you. He's making sure you are constantly tired, can't think properly and have no room for yourself. In short, he's wearing you out mentally.\nRun", "NTA but you have a boyfriend problem, not a kid problem. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t respecting your boundaries and you aren\u2019t enforcing them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for you to be able to request your bedroom be a kid free zone for several hours. At the very least the kids should be required to knock and ask for permission before entering, that\u2019s just common courtesy and they\u2019re old enough to understand. Unless your boyfriend is willing to work with you I think you may have a difficult decision to make.", "ESH\n\nYou have a right to have a place of peace, but BF is also right that you have to be willing to compromise in all things if you want to date a single parent. Especially one with three kids all close in age. And it doesn't seem like you want to be alone cause it seems like you are ok with your BF being in your space. Your issue seems to be with the kids. Sometimes deal breakers are deal breakers.", "NAH but I think you two have found the end point of your relationship. Its fine to not be okay with kids in your private space. Its also fine for his parenting ethos to be that his kids have free access to the house. However those two things are not compatible and that means the relationship either goes to being casual, or you breakup altogether", "Doesn\u2019t sound like living together is gonna work out", "YTA. His kids will always come first rightly so so you have to deal with that, don\u2019t date someone with 3 kids if you aren\u2019t prepared to deal with this.", "ESH\n\nThem for not respecting your boundaries.\n\nYou for dating a man with 3 young kids and expecting to not have to deal with those 3 young kids.\n\nIf you don't want to deal with kids, don't date a guy with 3 of them. I am not talking about just the bedroom situation. Your post makes it very clear how you feel about them in general.", "They do sound like nice but exhausting kids.  \n\nI think you need to get a lock for your room.  If your BF is bringing them over (and it is weird that he doesn't have you to their house), he needs to back you up on the no kids in the bedroom rule.  If he won't back you up, then he needs to stop bringing the kids over.  Because you will never feel comfortable moving in with him if he won't respect your need for some quiet time.\n\nI was going to go with E S H, but the more I think about it, the more it sounds like a boyfriend problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA - whether these are you bio kids or not, that is a perfectly fine boundary to set.  Sounds like they're not used to have boundaries set or enforced, and that is on your BF - you two need to agree to it and then you need to call him on it when he doesn't enforce it.", "YTA. I don't know why people date parents when they can't tolerate children", "[deleted]", "He has 3 kids! Either you can deal w it or not", "NTA\n\nset boundaries and for heavens sake get a lock for your door", "NTA, and based on your replies in the comments it seems your boyfriend is making you sacrifice your boundaries and peace of mind for his simple convenience.\n\nThe fact that this isn't a new topic and that he seems to almost willfully go deaf to your actual concerns and refuses to parent his children into respecting boundaries and behaving themselves at someone else's place is worrying.\n\nI'm pretty sure that if you move in with this man he is going to make you parent his kids for him while still not giving your boundaries consideration.\n\nI'd say breaking up would be for the best because your lifestyles aren't compatible and your BF isn't willing to make any effort.\n\nBreaking up with him means no more kids stomping into your room and on your nerves as a result, and not having to deal with a guy who willingly lets his kids do that will hopefully also let you decompress even more.\n\nThese weekends with the kids are a snap-shot into what living with him will be like. Take a good long look and decide whether this is what you want to go into. And do also consider that if circumstances change, then your BF might end up having the kids even more, meaning you get even less breathing room.", "NTA. Children have absolutely no business digging around in an adult bedroom. I think the first red flag to me though with this whole thing was that you\u2019ve been in a relationship for three years and have just met the kids six months ago. There\u2019s a reason he chose not to introduce them earlier. Yeah, I know it feels like bait and switch. That\u2019s a red flag. Carefully consider if this relationship is actually worth to you.", "NAH... It's your bedroom. Announce that you are going to your room to be alone & then lock the door.  Seems like they are really following their father, so he can't come in either during the time you set. If he can't adhere to this compromise,  maybe living together isn't the best idea.", "NTA. However, your partner is.\n\nIt seems as if he is forcing a good relationship into you and his kids, maybe you could ask him what his intentions are.\n\nYour house, your limits. And even if it was shared, kids are overwhelming and you are in your right to ask the bedroom to be off-limits.\n\nThings to consider: Do you want to be kind of child-free? If you and him had kids, would you treat them the same way?", "NTA. If you are going to be with someone that has kids it\u2019s INCREDIBLY important you set personal boundaries. My partner has 4 kids and there are special rules when they stay at my house. The biggest one being you don\u2019t come in my room without permission. I generally lock the door, but if I don\u2019t so my partner can come in, and they follow her they have to leave on the first request if they start getting wild. If they can sit quietly I generally don\u2019t mind but sometimes I just want time alone and that\u2019s completely reasonable. If your partner isn\u2019t going to handle his kids and support your boundaries you really need to think about whether you want to continue the relationship because a life of poorly behaved kids with a partner who doesn\u2019t handle them is going to be a nightmare.", "NTA and you should tell him to stop following you when you want some time to yourself knowing that the kids will follow him", "YTA these are kids they are showing their love for you.

If you are that uncomfortable around the kid crew, why did you board this boat?\n\nBF for sure has had to recognize the limits of ADHD, so you're just asking him to understand your need for decompression time.\n\nSome days my tolerance for chaos is better than others.  When this limit is reached, and I withdraw,  I don't want constant questions about what I want, or what someone else wants, being jostled, or noise.\n\nI want not so much to be left alone, but quiet time.

If the kids were younger and preschool age, I could argue that YTA. But even an 8 year old should be able to understand boundaries regardless of ADHD.

The kids have ADHD but your boyfriend's parenting is the problem. He's letting them walk all over you instead of disciplining them. Even kids with ADHD have to learn manners and consideration. They can do it, it just needs more effort than usual, as well as patience, gentleness, and consistency. You may have to let certain things go that they can't manage, but he's not enforcing even a basic standard of behavior. Instead of parenting his children, he's letting them run riot in your home and telling YOU to accept it. \n\nLooking at some of the details, his kids are on too many screens. (Three iPads going at top volume at the same time, in the same room, how do they even hear their own game? It's chaos.) Kids with this sort of ADHD need to be taken outside to run around for HOURS every day. Not just playing on swings but sprinting laps, playing soccer, kicking balls, hiking, and so on. If they are still doing flips at 7 pm then they have not done enough vigorous exercise during the day. They need morning sunlight to set their circadian rhythm and they need vigorous exercise to generate dopamine.\n\nI would argue that 7 pm is still family time and you should all be watching one movie together, not you and him in one room and them in another. Yes, watching the same movie as an 8 year old is very boring, but I do agree if you are going to be with your bf then you need to accept that many of your Saturday nights will be spent watching Despicable Me and things like that. Or you can play cards or a board game together, if you can remain calm and not snap at them when they break the rules (which they will, most kids do, even the ones who don't have ADHD). Then they should go to bed, say 9 pm  or 9:30 pm (I know you would prefer earlier but kids with ADHD often have a delayed sleep phase and if you try to put them to bed at 8 pm then you will just end up dealing with constant up-and-down until 10 pm), and THEN you and your boyfriend watch your own thing alone together. \n\nYou yourself, for your mental health, need your own downtime that you can rely on, and that is one reason that the privacy of your bedroom (keeping it off-limits to the kids) is important. At this age, they should be learning that an adult's bedroom is not their playground, and to respect boundaries of privacy of adults. \n\nWith ADHD, in my opinion, you need to work on one or two things at a time, because kids with ADHD only have so much attention and, if you try to fix everything simultaneously, they will get overwhelmed and feel like failures. But even if you just pick one thing to work on, you need him to buy in to the idea that he needs to parent his children, because he has to do the majority of the disciplining, and it sounds like he's not willing to do that.

Maybe have all people remove shoes at the door and wear house shoes so the dirt does not get in the whole house or on your bed.  These are solvable problems but you will have to have your bf agree and back you up.  Talk about this between the kids visiting.

They\u2019re bored and the adults aren\u2019t doing anything other than locking them out and handing them devices or leaving them to their own devices. They\u2019re kids.

Unless you want the rest of your life to be like this. Too much baggage and your bf doesn\u2019t understand what boundaries are.", "NTA, it's just too much. And you need to figure this out before moving in together. You deserve to have a space in your home that you can retreat to and is off limits - possibly to your  boyfriend as well at times. Unless you guys have a spare room floating around, your bedroom makes the most sense because it doesn't restrict the kids or your bf from using any area of the home that they'd need. You need to have a serious sit-down with your bf and explain. You've welcomed his kids into your home and your life, and you enjoy them and think they are great, but it's healthy to have boundaries and you have boundaries in your home. \n\nOne of those boundaries is the bedroomn being a kid free zone. It is important to you to have a space where you can have quiet and a moment to yourself whenever you need it, to leave things knowing they won't be disturbed, and to get some privacy when important. That you're not shutting the kids out of any other area of the home, but that it is YOUR house and you need at least ONE space that, even when the kids are over, you can retreat to. It's not a discussion, you're telling him what you NEED for this relationship to work. He's either going to understand or he's not going to care about how you're feeling. And that will determine, really, whether or not this relationship is going to work. If he understands, you have to help him put some boundaries in place. Doesn't sound like he has a lot of experience enforcing this, and the kids are likely unfamiliar as well. Help him. Hopefully he understands that respecting other people's boundaries is an important lesson to teach your kids. Draw up a few very simple house rules (shoes off when you come in, no going in my bedroom unless I personally invite you, turn off lights when not using them, use headphones on your tablets) - I mean, whatever you want but I'd start small and basic with just a few easy ones - but include the bedroom rule.\n\nThey are also not babies. You should be able to explain to them that you really need to have a space in your home that's just for you to have time and space to yourself, and that although they are welcome anywhere else in your home, that is the one space that they cannot enter without being specifically invited in.", "NTA.  But probably not ready to date someone with 3 kids.  Or at least to have them stay over.", "Wtf did I just read?! They do not sound like great kids tbh. They don't listen, disrespect your space and don't know how to play by themselves. But to be fair, this is more of a partner issue than a kid issue. I'm guessing he's never set rules for them, limited screen time or enforced small punishments? It sounds like you've become a doormat and are letting this man and his spawn steal your space, time and peace. Time to have a serious talk!", "They obviously feel very comfortable with you if they lay on your bed with their tablets. It's a sign they want closeness. \n\nYou might want to try saying, let's go hang out on the couch together instead because bedrooms are private and then move and keep your door shut. \n\nThey also obviously need something to burn off their energy. Some behaviour belongs outside and if that isn't an option, then maybe a punching bag and gloves or someway to get the wiggles out. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI would tell your boyfriend that on weekends when he has his children that he should stay at his place and not yours. You should then Visit and then sleep at your home. You definitely are not ready to for cohabitation while his children are young.

They\u2019ll leave on their own.", "NTA for being overwhelmed and wanting your own space to cool down. I have 3 kids (ages 3 -10) 2 so far with adhd. I am familiar with the chaos they can bring and how overstumulating it can be. I have locked the door to my bedroom for some quiet time plenty of times.\n\nI'm also very physically affectionate with my kids. I like being able to cuddle up on the bed and watch a movie. I would not be okay with being with someone who wanted to completely ban kids from the bedroom. My husband and I have fought over this. So I get where your boyfriend is coming from.\n\nHowever, there needs to be boundaries. If they can't sit still or they get too loud they have to leave. If they wanna watch their own thing, headphones, or they can leave. And if you need alone time, they need to leave. (They will probably never remember to wipe their feet though so just try to remind them.) And your boyfriend has to get on board with enforcing these boundaries.\n\nAnd you can try explaining to the kids how all the chaos makes you feel. They might try harder to listen then. I've explained to my kids using an analogy with something that over stimulates them, wet socks, long sleeves, itchy tags.\n\nBut if your boyfriend won't help with the boundaries...\n\nDo you ever plan on having your own kids? He won't be much different of a parent with your kids as he is with his current.\n\nAnd if you never want kids, what happens if the kids end up with him full time?", "OP It's time to set some serious boundaries with him and the children. A grownups bedroom should be off limits to children for various reasons. His children may be great kids, but they do need to learn and understand boundaries if your relationship is going to work out. Children are extremely smart, and they need structure and discipline along with rules that need to be followed. If they do not learn boundaries at home, they tend to not think about boundaries elsewhere and this reflects badly on the parents. I understand that your bf likes them being around and he probably doesn't want to give them boundaries because he doesn't see them that often, but at their ages they'll only get worse if things don't change. There is nothing wrong with compromising when it comes to children, but what he's saying is not compromising, it's letting the kids run the house and that's not something to compromise about. Everyone, including adults need some down time to decompress, and in order to do that you need a private, quiet space of your own. Your bedroom should be off limits to others and the children need to understand that and be respectful of it, apparently so does your bf. Get creative with the kids when they are there and do some serious outdoor activities with them to let them burn off some of that energy, but also teach them to respect the privacy that you need as an adult and your house. If your bf doesn't understand that then you should rethink moving in together.", "NTA. You say that the children follow their Dad into your room. Perhaps he needs to realise that when you go for space, he needs to stay with the kids. \nI would also recommend a simple latch on your door, so that the children Can't follow you into your room. Your OH may complain, but you need some way to protect your personal space, otherwise your only down time will be in the bathroom.", "NTA - Time to set clear boundaries. But first my advice. Don't move in together. \n\nThere are so many things wrong here. First do what you have to end the time at your home. Screw the bedroom issue that's small potatoes. They shouldn't be at your home. He doesn't live there. \n\nSecond you need to understand what you're getting into. These kids are unmanaged, undisciplined and unmedicated. Now I know not everyone goes the medication route with ADHD and that's fine. But with it or without it you have to put in time, effort and therapy to find out what works for each kid. It's not cookie cutter and you can't ignore it and hope it resolves itself. \n\nIt doesn't sound like their mom or dad is doing this which means you have a life of issues ahead of you. These poor children need guidance not devices. But I digress.\n\nCommunicate with your boyfriend. Let him know your house is off limits for the time being and it's not up for discussion. That time has passed. That you'd like to see some real progress in his children's behavior before you even consider moving in together. That they aren't bad kids but need guidance and you don't feel he's doing that.\n\nHonestly if he only has them every other weekend. That's 4 days a month. He should be one on one with them giving them quality dad time. I hope you see that too.", "His kids are way too old to behave like this. He needs to actually parent them, especially if they have ADHD. He is doing them a huge disservice otherwise. If my 8 year old who also has ADHD behaved like this, I would not allow him into my room while I was trying to decompress either.

That being said, it\u2019s completely understandable for you to want alone time, and you deserve it. It seems the issue of the kids following only happens because their dad goes in the room with you. Can\u2019t he just give you that time off? It seems he only has the kids every other weekend so can\u2019t he just entertain them during that time and give you alone time?!? As for entertaining them, I have 2 AuDHD kids one more autistic presenting and the other is more ADHD presenting; I\u2019d recommend you make \u201cI\u2019m bored lists\u201d with activities they are allowed to do in your house or out if you have a yard and you can just refer them to the list when needed so it\u2019s less of a mental drain on you.", "NTA Part of the problem is your boyfriend leaves the kids alone to follow you into your bedroom. He needs to stay out there with them. Also, he needs to take those kids out of the house to get rid of some of that excess energy - a park, a trampoline place where they can do flips safely, up and down the sidewalk on their bicycles. There needs to be balance and boundaries. He needs to respect them.

Because they sound like my adhd kid pre-medication", "I don\u2019t understand why you allow the kids to misbehave in your bed. You need to have a conversation with your bf about what is appropriate behavior and if you are allowed to enforce the rules you set up. \n\nSit down with all of the kids and tell them you are willing to compromise and they can share time but there are rules, and they will be enforced. Wiping feet, taking off shoes, and perhaps even washing hands. No flips, or other activities that move the bed too much. If you are watching something they can\u2019t be doing things that interrupt and make it difficult to follow. And on for what ever else. \n\nI\u2019m sure others will disagree and say it is parenting, but I don\u2019t think it is. I have always had basic, common sense rules at my home. When my kids were growing up their friends were never turned away, but they also knew some behavior wasn\u2019t tolerated. They could play and whatnot but they needed to help pick up before they left. Enjoy snacks and such, but trash and dishes needed to be taken care of (dishes just returned to the kitchen). And what ever else. But the same things were expected at friend\u2019s homes as well. \n\nYou also need to talk to your bf about general rules of your place. He coparents with his ex so the kids have to have different expectations and rules at both homes. The same should be for your home as well. Do both of their parents allow the obnoxious behavior of being out of control all the time? ADHD is real, both my ex and I have it, though his was undiagnosed until after we divorced. All three of our kids have different levels, as well as symptoms from the disorder, my oldest being the most severe. It was hard, but he was constantly reminded that instead of action A, which wasn\u2019t allowed, we needed to do action B. If the kids aren\u2019t being treated for their ADHD I would question why. Not because I think all people that are neurodivergent need to be medicated, rather that helping children redirect behavior, learn what is appropriate behavior, and teaching them coping methods for their disorder will help them go further in life not just now, but for their entire lives. There are soooo many issues that can be a huge negative impact in life, not only now, but as an adult. Some traits are outgrown but there are a lot that aren\u2019t and they can have devastating consequences as an adult  \n\nI hope you realize you can\u2019t move in together until these issues are resolved or everyone is going to be unhappy.

We watch family movies together in our bed a couple times a month but it's always planned.", "It\u2019s nerve wrecking to say the least even more so that I\u2019m naturally the biggest introvert.! Can\u2019t even imagine being pushed to this limit", "It sounds like this works well for you. OP's boyfriend needs to read this.\n\nI don't understand why they all spend so much time at *her* place. With three kids, the boyfriend likely has a much bigger home, where the kids would have their own spaces and their own things. Why don't visits occur at his house and when OP needs time alone, she can go home?", "I agree this is NTA and a boyfriend problem but I also feel like it's a logistics/expectations problem. I don't think it's a realistic expectation that they are going to get couple time while the kids are awake. Turning on a movie for me and my husband in one room and a different movie for the kids in another room would NEVER work in my house. It feels like it should, but it doesn't. Maybe I could train my kids into it, but we generally just have our couple time after the kids are in bed. I can't tell how much custody the boyfriend has, but if they're only seeing him on weekends, I would say they SHOULDN'T separate him from the kids while they're there.\n\nAlso, the easiest way to keep kids out of a room you don't want them in is to lock the door. If there's some really good reason why you can't, then you train them to respect signals, but it's a lot of work. The door lock works a lot better.", "Yeah, if OP is asking for alone time and the boyfriend crashes that 20 minutes later and the kids are following *him*, *he* is the one not respecting boundaries. And, obviously, he's not going to teach his kids any better.", "He sounds like a shit dad honestly", ">you have a boyfriend problem, not a kid problem.\n\nThis is wisdom right here.   \n\nI would add that there are going to be some practicalities that you have to understand, if his kids continue to come over.   They are going to come in,  there is no real private space.  And especially if dad is in the room, they are going to come in.   \n\nThat said,  you can still have some rules.  e.g. kids have to have headphones in if they are going to be bleep-blooping on tablets and phones.   \n\nAlso, you can lock the bedroom door to keep BF out .  Its fine to come check on you, but that can be \\*knockknock\\* \"you ok?\"  \"yep\" and BF moves along.  \n\nAll of which sounds like you and BF need to have a productive discussion about this.  I don't think  you are being unreasonable wanting private time/space/area.  You do need to understand the practicalities of this now that kids are in the picture.    Plus its a good thing that they like you.    \n\nNTA\n\nThere is also something else you need to make sure you are clear on.  BF kids aren't going to go anywhere.  If anything they are going to be around more and more as time goes on.  If BF's kids are going to be a serious problem,  you need to be honest with yourself and whether you can stand, or better yet, bond with his kids.  Cause if you can't........", "Yea, she's NTA about wanting some alone time but a little TA for giving BF a pass here and blaming the kids. It's totally normal for little kids to want to be around the adults, that's not an \"issue.\" BF needs to be a dad to his children and support his partner in getting her alone time but occupying the kids while she's decompressing", "Yes. I was surprised that the older two are 12 and 13. Usually by that point kids are pretty well set to do their own thing. I don\u2019t mean the \u201cmoody teen\u201d stereotype, just that they probably have plenty of things to entertain themselves somewhere else.", "I found that odd as well, but there might be a reasonable explanation?", "This. I\u2019m sure when I was a toddler things were different, but by 8 years old I definitely knew mom & dad\u2019s room was off limits. I could knock if I needed them of course, but there was no busting in and hanging out in their room just to hang out in their room. \n\nThis is a totally reasonable boundary, and I also agree OP and boyfriend may just not be compatible.", "It's not uncommon to delay introducing the kids until a relationship is well established. Seeing partners come and go isn't healthy for them either.\n\nI think in this case, though, the boyfriend was hoping the kids would chill out a little as they got older... or that OP would be too far into sunk costs by then.", "This! I was going to say she can always lock the door. Seems to me they follow the dad where ever he goes. So I\u2019d lock them all out lol.", "I think she can tolerate children but the kids  constantly around her probably is tiring", "What the hell? These are not toddlers. Children need to learn to manage their own time without being entertained constantly. Hovering and engaging kids constantly and not giving them alone time is not good parenting.\n\nAlso, If OP wants alone time in their own home, they are entitled to that. \n\nThe whole family has boundary and entitlement issues. Just because OP goes to the room doesn't mean the kid's dad has to. He should be spending time with them without OP there. He is the one they are there to see. If he didn't abandon them to the room, they wouldn't follow. OP is not a parent and has no responsibility to them other than basic kindness and a safe space.\n\nNone of their behavior is age appropriate and their dad is not behaving as one would expect from a responsible adult. He is acting as another toddler OP has to manage and  give attention to.", "Did you even read what OP said properly? Cause you\u2019re reaching with your statement. She have no problems with the kids. She needs alone time in her house and nobody respects her boundaries.", "Is it to much to ask for alone time everyone needs it", "I don't understand his need to follow her to the bedroom, knowing she needs to decompress a bit. He enjoys being with his kids, and that's great!  Be with your kids and leave your girl alone for a bit. Lol... she doesn't dislike the children,but she isn't a mother, right? That's gotta be a lot to get used to, as a single woman.", "This should be the top response.", "I feel like this is something that differs from family to family. We basically went into our parents' room whenever growing up. The door being open was permission. \n\nWhich makes me wonder if these kids have no boundaries, or just different boundaries.", "I coslept with my kids when they were babies to young toddlers, but by the age of 8, they stopped coming into my room without permission.  I have no tv in my room, so it's not a hang out zone.  Their own bedrooms/beds (when 2 had to share a room) are their own space and no one else can be there without their permission.  The kitchen, living room, and rec room are all public, sharing spaces in the house and you don,t get to complain if other people are hanging around you there.  Bedroom and bathroom are private spaces.  Easy and important rule to teach.", "Asking to come into your room? Planning a movie? Wow you sound like such a fun parent...", "Same. Im a complete introvert and my gf is not. Having a partner that gets you and knows you need alone time is huge. I can spend an afternoon in my room reading, and then come out to cook dinner for everyone and build legos with the kiddos because my boundaries are respected and I get the time I need.", "I was on the fence about the whole thing until I got to the part about them NOT living together and her bf is bringing his kids to her place. As OP kept saying \u201cmy bed/room\u201d, I was thinking wow, OP thinks of their bedroom as just her own! Whelp I was completely wrong!!\n\nOP, it is *your* home and you have every right to dictate who can go where. I don\u2019t find it unreasonable at all that you want your bedroom off limits; everyone needs a space for themselves, and you\u2019ve designated your room as that space. If your bf can\u2019t even support this one rule now, he will likely bulldoze any future boundaries you try to set. \n\nYou\u2019re right that the poor behaviors are the result of parental shortcomings. It can be difficult, but have you tried just sitting down with the kids and explaining to them the importance of boundaries and that your room is off limits? Sometimes, all it takes is another adult to calmly and politely explain a different point of view. I\u2019ve done that with my cousin\u2019s kids, but I try to explain it in a way that doesn\u2019t undermine their parents. Simply put, they need to know that different places require different rules and the expectation is to respect those rules. \n\nNTA and good luck!", "I don't think she's looking for couple time while the kids are there. It sounds like she is looking for a few minutes of decompression and her bf follows her and is in turn followed by his children. Her bf should set the expectation and also abide by it, that when OP excuses herself they entertain themselves until she returns. With four guests over, three of them children, it makes sense to me that she would need a few minutes respite to stay regulated.", "It almost sounds like the BF has a problem with the concept of spending time alone.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to be alone.  His kids don\u2019t want to be alone.  Someone says they want to be alone and they aren\u2019t left alone.\n\nI wonder if he has some sort of association between \u201ctime alone\u201d and \u201canger\u201d or \u201carguments\u201d or something.\n\nThe whole check on her after maybe 20 minutes is insane.", "Kinda agree, yeah. If the kids are constantly bouncing off the walls with energy, they obviously need more stimulation and he should be aware of that. More activities, more sports, more play dates, more running around in the woods. And the fact that there are three of them but they can't ever entertain themselves is weird too. Do they not how to play? Dad seems unbothered by all this, which makes him a lame parent. Not to mention he's obviously not teaching them manners, house rules (no flips inside, is that so hard?), boundaries, listening to No, how to be a good guest...", "Yeah just from her description he sounds like a loser.", "Yeah. Sounds like the kids are starved for attention", "Yep. He can't even give up *her* bedroom to spend time with his kids. He says he wants to be around them and that's why he doesn't want to limit them from the room. But clearly that's not it, because he'd simply spend time with them in the other rooms of the house if that were the case. \n\n\n\nI'm also laughing that they put a movie on at 7pm and expected them to leave them alone while they were in another room. I'll give OP the benefit of the doubt as she's only known the kids for 6 months and is new to having children in the house. But come on, this guy has been a parent over a decade. He had to have known they were going to interrupt them.", "Yep. I\u2019m so over these posts like \u201cmy partner is a shitty parent, how do I tell him to parent his kids?\u201d \n\nYou don\u2019t. You\u2019re the interloper in this situation. You can see that living together isn\u2019t gonna work. \n\nAlso it\u2019s silly to be like \u201cit\u2019s 7, you\u2019re to stay out entirely\u201d like\u2026..these are kids. You get your actual, uninterrupted alone time, when they\u2019re in bed. \n\nSick of poorly suited adults playing house.", "And I dare say worse as teenagers!", "OP TRUST me when I say, this will get old REAL fast.  You sound like someone who values your personal space and time to \"reset\". You need someone who allows you to have this.  Your BF, being the retriever type will never respect this of you, seeing as he doesn't now.  I would not move in with him, cuz you'll be dealing with this 24/7 rather than every other weekend.  Good luck.", ">They are just \"Velcro\" kids but so is their dad. I mean, he's very much so a golden retriever BF and follows me everywhere too so the kids get it from him.\n\nPopping in to say that this gets much worse when they move in.

You don't have to answer this question to me, but you really need to for yourself.", "Then you really need to sit down and have a serious talk with him about this and stop letting him blow you off. First and foremost, all weekends need to be at his house. Packing his kids off to yours half the time when they are already splitting homes is not good stability. When they have access to their own rooms and their own possessions, you may also find they are less on top of you. If you do move in together, either privacy in your bedroom must be enforced or you need your own retreat in the house to go when you are overstimulated - this is a valid need and should be respected. Likewise, I totally get the dirty feet in bed ick *shudder*.

I had to step-by-step explain why that\u2019s a huge breach in privacy to my DH. He finally got it and took her key back but I still have to explain certain family boundaries. They absolutely grew up sharing everything out of need. That\u2019s no longer a need so I\u2019m asking for boundaries. You will have to explain forever why you need a boundary. I took on that after realizing but being so invested in him and us and it ended up working out. His mom and sister love me now and I love them and we\u2019ve had great talks.
