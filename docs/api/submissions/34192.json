{"id": 34192, "submission_id": "18wvaeb", "title": "AITA for refusing to let my boyfriends kids in my room?", "selftext": "Been with my BF for 3 years. Was introduced to his 3 children 6 months or so ago. Great kids but all of them lack boundaries and it's obviously a parental issue more so than their issue. They are 13(male), 12(female) and 8(male). The 2 younger ones have ADHD as well and are off the walls 24/7.\n\nWe started doing weekend sleepovers 2 months ago and it's honestly been hell. For no other reason outside of the fact that I literally have zero space to decompress because the kids follow you everywhere you go. They have no clue how to entertain themselves. Given that they are literal children, I don't blame them. But my one hard limit is the kids being in my room. I don't like anyone in my bedroom. That's my private space. But there have been multiple times when I have been in the bedroom and one or all of the kids will come in and just take over my bed completely. Laying down with their tablets. Or if I'm watching TV in there, more often than not they will come in and take over my TV or just talk 24/7 so I can't focus on anything other than them and their questions. Despite the fact that usually when I do watch TV in my room, it's because they have taken over the TV in the living room and there's no place to sit. I've told my BF I don't want anyone in my room and that it makes me uncomfortable but it's almost as if he thinks it doesn't apply to his children because just days after telling him this, him and I were watching a movie around 7pm (when the kids have their downtime and had a movie on for themselves in the living room) and all of his kids came in to my room and immediately climbed in to my bed so I was stuck in a 2ft square in my own space because I couldn't move otherwise. That and they bring their tablets with them. So I'm trying to watch a movie and all 3 of them have their tablets on my bed with the volume up and I have never been so overstimulated in my life. And it happens all the time. If we are in my room, they are too. If we are in the kitchen, they follow us. If we go outside, they are right behind us (but we can't get them to go outdoors by themselves).\n\nYesterday I had a terrible day (family stuff). My BF had his kids over and I was just needing space away from their chaos. I said I was going to my bedroom to get time alone. BF comes in maybe 20 minutes later to check on me and not even 2 minutes following that, his kids are in my room and on my bed. The youngest doing flips and moving the bed from the wall. I told them to get out 6 times before they actually listened. My BF said they just want to be around us and I said I don't care. My bedroom is off limits from this point forward. He said he doesn't think he can do that because he enjoys having his kids near him and doesn't want to shut them out and asked me to reconsider or \"make a schedule\" of when they could be in my room with us. I refuse. He says I'm being unreasonable and that by being with a single parent, I need to learn compromise.\n\nETA: I'm 30. He's 32. The only issue I have is with the kids being in my bedroom. I don't hide away in there or anything like that (kinda sounded like that in the post due to poor wording). I usually only slip away to my bedroom between 6-7pm but they almost immediately follow me because their dad does. Admittedly, if they would just sit down and not do flips or jump on my bed or shift the bed away from the wall or even wipe their feet before getting in to my bed, I would probably be willing to compromise. However, they've been told several times that my bed is not a jungle gym and to stop jumping/doing front flips. The youngest does not listen at all because of the overwhelming amount of energy he has. He is constantly doing flips over everything- not just my bed. Not a single one of them wipe their feet so there's constantly dirt and when I remind them, it's met with a \"sorry, I forgot\" and then still don't wipe their feet. They're great kids. I get along with them really well. But it doesn't change the fact that my space is disrespected and they have no business being in my bedroom. We do not live together. This is happening at my home. He has been bringing the kids to my house every other weekend because we have been tiptoeing around the idea of moving in together.

Acting this out like this, afraid to go outside? ADHD isn't an excuse, I've been tired for years of hearing about this being the problem with kids that act out. Parent them ffs. They're literally being raised by tablets.\n\nI digress.\n\nMoving in together is not going to work, nor is this relationship. The kids have no respect for you and I doubt they ever will, they treat you like a sibling or play thing. \"Thanks but no thanks\" and a clean break. I sincerely doubt you are willing to parent them. You're not the asshole for not being willing to compromise. \n\nHowever, YTA for dating for 3 years and just now bothering to get to know the kids. In spite of how frustrating this story is to read for you, I feel bad for dad here. I don't think you were on board to begin with.", "Nta, kids should have boundaries and not be able to do what they want. But I dont think you and your bf are compatible, based on his reaction. \n\nIf they HAVE to be in the room with their tablets, couldnt they at least use headphones so youre not overstimulated?\n\nIts wild to me how people say this comes with kids, but growing up with 3 siblings, we understood privacy. We werent allowed in our parents bedroom without their permission.  We respected each others space. This was in the 90s. I dont understand what has happened since that most parents say \u201cthey just burst in\u201d and they go wherever, and theres no such thing as privacy. Im not saying shut away, but they should know if youre not feeling good mentally, you need time alone to decompress. \n\n\nWhy are people raising their kids to do whatever they want with no boundaries? Thats not how the real world works. Boundaries exist. Create them and utilize them.", "NTA - my parents never wanted us (5 kids) in their room growing up. It\u2019s beyond reasonable to have a boundary around your privacy; have you talked to the kids about it? I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t want you interfering with their privacy either.", "No rating. You sound a lil nuts, thinking youd have solo time when family visits. Especially if you retreat to your room and for some reason, believe no one in the house will look for you. Youre treating these kids like baggage. Having adhd has nothing to do with the attention seeking. You spend all your time with them when theyre there. Freaking learn! Alone time is when theyre asleep, thats it. Regardless of age. Sometimes after dinner, depending on routines (homework, sports, separate tv rooms, etc. but thats an hour or two max) try planning an entire weekend WITH THEM. And you can try sending them to a candy store w some $ or invite them to bring their bikes to go on a ride without you if you need an hour solo (dad can join them cycling). But yes, having kids or many kids, a weekend together is a weekend TOGETHER. Its a ton of logistics on their side - maintaining laundry and org for the following week and taking the weekend to see you at home. Like premake some cookies and have a decorating party together - each get a tub to take home. The premaking prevents any mess of baking together. The decor part is also social. Having a vote on 2 movies, one u all watch together in the bed, and the second the kids watch in the living room following it. Adults optional. Just make your bedroom no boys allowed. Until further notice. If youre really expecting to have solo movie time each day. There are nature scavenger hunt lists you can find online. And have them go outdoors and do it. Prize can be ya make a center piece with it all etc. a wreath, something that decorates the place and they can see a part of the family in ur place. Ipads dont really count as spending time together even if ur all piled together doing it.", "NTA. Setting boundaries is heathy and necessary for all children. It doesn't matter if they're your own kids or your partner's kids. They have to learn respect for other people's physical and emotional sovereignty. \n\nYour boyfriend is TA here. You may be irreparably incompatible due to this. He refuses to take ownership of his responsibilities of parenting his children. He refuses to respect your needs. That's certainly not someone I would want to be with.", "You're NTA, but neither is he. If he wants to compromise, he should stay in the living room with them while you go into your own room. And he can get you a lock. But his feelings are as valid as yours, he obviously doesn't want you to be locked away, but if it's only for an hour then he should be able to spend an hour without you. You don't have kids and you have had all this time and space to yourself, now his children are coming over, taking over the place and going nuts, and it is probably an adjustment for you. At the same time, he loves you and his kids and wants to spend time with all of you and relax. There are different ways of resolving this, you just have to decide what is the least stressful way in the long run. If you love him and are otherwise happy in your relationship, this is likely something you will have to get used to at some stage. But if it's not for you, you can always find someone who is just as great minus the kids.", "I work part time from home so when my kids were young was with them 24/7 in the summer.  I remember getting so over stimulated, I'd go upstairs to our room to just ger some alone time.  Within 10 minutes they would have all followed me up there, and would all be on the bed..  My husband would be downstairs--alone.  But I never told them to leave...I mean, they wanted to be with me, right?  I am their mom.   Now the older two are away at college and I am lucky if I get to talk to them once a week!\n\nI don't think you are the AH, but if you are getting that over stimulated from a weekend visit I think you need to really consider whether this is the relationship for you.  I mean what if something changed and your boyfriend had to have them all the time?  What would that be like for you?", "ESH. He\u2019s right that if you\u2019re serious with someone who has kids, you\u2019re going to need to compromise (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s his bedroom too?). But he\u2019s also not asking you to compromise, he\u2019s asking you to completely sacrifice your bedroom as a personal space. \n\nYou two are not compatible. Time to move on.", "So they have a room of their own? Make it so they are on the floor only. Get them headphones so you done hear the tablets. Tell your BF you need an hour to YOURSELF and he has to stick to it! Demand boundaries! I get it we all need alone time.", "You've been with your boyfriend for 3 years and only met his children 6 months ago? What?", "NTA. your compromise as a non-parent is agreeing to let them stay in your home. they dont need to be harassing you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand letting someone who isn\u2019t the couple into their bedroom. Kids always get the whole damn house/apartment, why can\u2019t the person who pays for it get 100 sqft to themselves???", "NTA. But don't be a doormat. He's refusing to hear you. He's constantly disrespecting you. He's making sure you are constantly tired, can't think properly and have no room for yourself. In short, he's wearing you out mentally.\nRun", "NTA but you have a boyfriend problem, not a kid problem. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t respecting your boundaries and you aren\u2019t enforcing them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for you to be able to request your bedroom be a kid free zone for several hours. At the very least the kids should be required to knock and ask for permission before entering, that\u2019s just common courtesy and they\u2019re old enough to understand. Unless your boyfriend is willing to work with you I think you may have a difficult decision to make.", "ESH\n\nYou have a right to have a place of peace, but BF is also right that you have to be willing to compromise in all things if you want to date a single parent. Especially one with three kids all close in age. And it doesn't seem like you want to be alone cause it seems like you are ok with your BF being in your space. Your issue seems to be with the kids. Sometimes deal breakers are deal breakers.", "NAH but I think you two have found the end point of your relationship. Its fine to not be okay with kids in your private space. Its also fine for his parenting ethos to be that his kids have free access to the house. However those two things are not compatible and that means the relationship either goes to being casual, or you breakup altogether", "Doesn\u2019t sound like living together is gonna work out", "YTA. His kids will always come first rightly so so you have to deal with that, don\u2019t date someone with 3 kids if you aren\u2019t prepared to deal with this.", "ESH\n\nThem for not respecting your boundaries.\n\nYou for dating a man with 3 young kids and expecting to not have to deal with those 3 young kids.\n\nIf you don't want to deal with kids, don't date a guy with 3 of them. I am not talking about just the bedroom situation. Your post makes it very clear how you feel about them in general.", "They do sound like nice but exhausting kids.  \n\nI think you need to get a lock for your room.  If your BF is bringing them over (and it is weird that he doesn't have you to their house), he needs to back you up on the no kids in the bedroom rule.  If he won't back you up, then he needs to stop bringing the kids over.  Because you will never feel comfortable moving in with him if he won't respect your need for some quiet time.\n\nI was going to go with E S H, but the more I think about it, the more it sounds like a boyfriend problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA - whether these are you bio kids or not, that is a perfectly fine boundary to set.  Sounds like they're not used to have boundaries set or enforced, and that is on your BF - you two need to agree to it and then you need to call him on it when he doesn't enforce it.", "YTA. I don't know why people date parents when they can't tolerate children", "Not reading all of it. NTA. I don\u2019t let my 3yo step daughter in my bed. Whether I\u2019m in it or not. I don\u2019t want to create a habit and don\u2019t want her getting in bed with us while we\u2019re sleeping. I don\u2019t let her in our room either. That\u2019s our space and she has her own space which she doesn\u2019t allow me in. Now my wife won\u2019t let the dog in the bed though because I won\u2019t let my step daughter in the bed. Dog sleeps in a crate at night so no risk of intruding so it\u2019s apples and oranges to me. Maybe I\u2019m an asshole but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for a 3yo to be in bed with two naked adults and I don\u2019t want her making a habit of trying to get in bed. She also bangs on our door crying just because she has to pee and she\u2019s fully potty trained all we have to do is tell her to go potty and she does it but holy fuck is it annoying.

Either you can deal w it or not", "NTA\n\nset boundaries and for heavens sake get a lock for your door", "NTA, and based on your replies in the comments it seems your boyfriend is making you sacrifice your boundaries and peace of mind for his simple convenience.\n\nThe fact that this isn't a new topic and that he seems to almost willfully go deaf to your actual concerns and refuses to parent his children into respecting boundaries and behaving themselves at someone else's place is worrying.\n\nI'm pretty sure that if you move in with this man he is going to make you parent his kids for him while still not giving your boundaries consideration.\n\nI'd say breaking up would be for the best because your lifestyles aren't compatible and your BF isn't willing to make any effort.\n\nBreaking up with him means no more kids stomping into your room and on your nerves as a result, and not having to deal with a guy who willingly lets his kids do that will hopefully also let you decompress even more.\n\nThese weekends with the kids are a snap-shot into what living with him will be like.

If they can sit quietly I generally don\u2019t mind but sometimes I just want time alone and that\u2019s completely reasonable.

I figured waiting a year was sufficient but he wanted to \"play it safe\" and not introduce me to the kids until he knew I was \"in it for the long haul\". They knew I existed. I bought them Christmas and birthday gifts despite never having met them. But after he introduced us all, something switched. After that the kids were always around and we never had any time alone. So it went from 0 to 100 immediately.", "It\u2019s her house haha she has the right to not want them in her bedroom. It\u2019s basic respect.", ">If you are that uncomfortable around the kid crew, why did you board this boat?\n\nKids are also able to learn boundaries...They care capable of controlling themselves and respecting spaces if asked...", "I've tried talking to all of them (BF included) about all of it. Nothing ever changes but there's a shit load of apologizing. They all apologize (including BF) for \"forgetting\" but then continue to do it anyways. I don't mind kids. I just don't want them in my room.", "Hers. Check her comments", "Mine", "They are great kids. I just outlined what my issue was because I only wanted judgement on the problem in the equation. They are all super intelligent. The boys are little comedians in training and constantly make me laugh. The girl is so artistically talented and can already draw portraits with precision. It's simply that they don't have any boundaries at all but I'm starting to realize that neither does their father. There's no such thing as a \"this is mine and this is yours\". It's literally like a \"everything in this house is all of ours and we need to share everything\".", "You don't know anything. If you have kids I feel sorry for them but my guess is you don't.", "I'm 30. He's 32. The only issue I have is them being in my bedroom. Its not appropriate (for me). My ex also had 2 children, whom I helped raise and still see often. But they never acted like this so I will admit that I am not used to this. It overwhelms me and quite frankly, pisses me off that I have to constantly push my bed back where it belongs because they are doing flips and jumping on it or having to vacuum off my bed before sleeping because of all the dirt.", "He doesn\u2019t sound like a good partner. What is he actually adding to your life at this point?", "Do they have a third home? Or does he have full custody?\n\nBecause I'm baffled that a father would be intentionally inflicting this level of chaos on his kids (whether shuttling them between their home with him and your home, or their home with him, your home, and their home with their mom).\n\nThat they follow you from room to room makes it sound like they're uncomfortable in your space. But kids who were uncomfortable wouldn't be jumping on your bed, especially after being asked to stop.\n\nI think it's time to uninvite them from coming over -- tell him you'll be happy to visit them at his place (if you will be) -- because this situation sounds really unhealthy for both you and the kids.", ">not sure why I wouldn't just be invited to his place- as it's bigger\n\nHave you communicated this to him?", " \u201cnot sure why\u201d. Talk to your partner. Tell them this isn\u2019t working for you. Communicate.", "You should include this in your post. This isn't even a shared home for the two of you. He's bringing his kids to visit your place and refuses to parent them.", "Teenagers can grasp \"do not enter my gf's bedroom\". Kids this age do not typically follow you from room to room.", "Teens and tweens following you from room to room is not normal. Since it's just your room, in a home that is exclusively yours, NTA and your rules win.", "then yall honestly need to break up or not have his kids over again. they are used to having a close relationship with their father, being able to sit in the room with him and lay in bed with him. you aren\u2019t okay with that and it\u2019s not fair to change that for the kids because you aren\u2019t okay with it", "We weren't allowed in our parents bedroom growing up, I don't blame you for that boundary at all. Maybe things would be going better if you were at their house so they have their own stuff & space?", "Fair enough but this just sounds like how kids act - theyre loud and invade your personal space.", "He has them every weekend and he comes here with them every other weekend.", "I have. He says my home is closer to everything.", "[removed]", "That's not really a valid reason, especially if his place is larger. Sounds like he wants them to wreck your place rather than his.\n\nAlso, it's clear that he has definitely fallen into the weekend Dad syndrome where he is not setting appropriate boundaries, not actively parenting like he should because he doesn't have them all the time. These are all issues that need to be resolved before you guys move in together.\n\nBut the first piece of the conversation needs to be that these weekends will now take place at his home, so that if you get overwhelmed, you can just leave.\n\nEdit: missing words", "Just a note - those kids are old enough to entertain themselves. The fact that they do not do so is a parenting problem. I am wondering if they are starved for adult attention and closeness. These are things for your boyfriend to address.", "So what??? That\u2019s just him prioritizing his convenience over your sanity.  Stop letting him do that\u2026", "Take this as a warning : he is not actually a real parent, or he would be helping his quite old kids to learn how to behave. He is instead looking to dump the responsibility of them off on you and outsource the work. He does not respect or value you.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
