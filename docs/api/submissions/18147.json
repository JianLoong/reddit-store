That's a different story for a different day) 3 times since he left. It's now almost summer 2023 and he hasn't visited this year at all, nor has he called in a few months. He works a very intense first responder job that's mostly seasonal in the PNW so I try to give as much space as possible for him to call. The problems with this started last summer when I found out he had been engaged and dating someone else for almost a year before leaving myself and the kids. I blew up but was clear about my need for space to process it. I was told my needs space was childish and if I can't be a grown up then they can't talk to me. At no point in my parenting with my ex have I felt respected and I don't want my daughter to feel that way or my son to treat someone that way. I told him unless he promises visits and starts paying the court ordered child support he would have to call my phone to talk to his kids. We haven't heard from him since and I don't know if we ever will again. Am I The Asshole for ruining my children's relationship with their father. If I would have bent more at least they would know his voice.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
