It was about 22 people over.\n\nMy brother (26 m) and his gf Brittni (24f) were there. Brittni is a transplant from Ohio, she\u2019s been here for a little under 2 years. She\u2019s been with my brother almost just as long.\n\nBrittni is vocal about hating shellfish, esp crawfish and shrimp. She has said they are bugs/water roaches and they gross her out. My family (esp my dad and uncles) teases her about not liking shellfish, but it\u2019s not malicious.\n\nAt the cookout I didn\u2019t see Brittni or my brother until everyone settled.

I understand why you didn\u2019t tell her, but given how much of a hard time she\u2019d been given about the issue I absolutely understand why she was upset. She is probably now  preparing herself to be pressured into eating shellfish for the rest of the time she knows your family. People will be total AHs about it because they already have been. Teasing people for their preferences is so rude- and now that she\u2019s eaten it once you know they will never let up. \n\nYou say the teasing isn\u2019t malicious, but does it make her uncomfortable? If yes, then they need to stop. We aren\u2019t required to like the food people think we need to like. And liking it in one dish doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to ever want to eat it again. You know they\u2019ll never let her forget this- we all know these kinds of people and they\u2019re awful. I hurt for her. I\u2019d be surprised if she ever comes to a family dinner again because she just doesn\u2019t want to deal with the teasing.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t intentionally do it as a gotcha, but she had a pretty decent reason to think you did, considering your uncle\u2019s comments and the general attitude you\u2019ve described coming from your family. I will say it was not great for you to not serve a shellfish-free main dish, since both entree options had shellfish.\n\nThat said, I see a lot of people saying she shouldn\u2019t care because she doesn\u2019t have a specific restriction and she couldn\u2019t taste it. That\u2019s really not true. It sounds like she finds the idea of eating shellfish gross, regardless of the taste. To people who eat crayfish normally, that seems weird, but food norms are very cultural. Think of something you wouldn\u2019t want to eat because you don\u2019t consider it normal food- crickets or horse meat or bull testicles, whatever it may be. How would you feel if you found out the dish you just ate had that as an ingredient, even though you couldn\u2019t taste it? For most people, that would be somewhat distressing. That\u2019s how Brittni feels about crayfish, so the fact that she enjoyed the taste really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her discomfort.", "NTA. You didn't see her until after she ate the pasta, so of course you didn't think to tell her ahead of time.

Were you supposed to place a little card next to each dish with a description of what it contains? I would be somewhat more sympathetic if she had a shellfish allergy. However, even if someone has an allergy, they (or their parent/guardian) would need to ask about potential allergens before eating any.", "NTA for not explicitly telling her about the crawfish, but as a good host I would have warned her. Frankly, it sounds like your family are assholes. They tease her but it\u2019s not \u201cmalicious?\u201d Are you certain she sees it that way? Especially when they talk about \u201cmaking her a real southern girl?\u201d  You could be hell of a lot more sensitive to her. She\u2019s already the odd one out and yes, your family are othering her. I\u2019m a new Englander married to a southerner and before that I was in a serious relationship with someone from another country.

In the strictest sense YNTA but I think your wider family owe her an apology.", "NTA, I lived in Louisiana for a couple years. I very quickly learned that most pasta dishes in the southern part of the state have a lot of spice and normally some kind of crawfish or seafood. If it was at a restaurant its usually mentioned but at an event in someone's house I would fully expect crawfish in most of the dishes just due to the  culture. Maybe next time give her a warning but it's not like this was done maliciously and she is being a tad dramatic.", "NTA.\nIn Louisiana especially there are a ton of food-centered gatherings, and crawfish is literally in everything. Lol.\n\nI have a few food restrictions, so it's common sense for me, I always ask what is in a dish before I eat it. \n\nIf she really wants to avoid eating certain ingredients, she needs to be the one asking what is in the dish. It's not your job to babysit her food choices.", "YTA.\n\nI'm our house cook, my wife bakes. In your description of what was available, I saw two main dishes, both of which had crawfish in them. Besides a bunch of side dishes, was there a main option for Brittni that didn't include crawfish? If not, why not? If not, why didn't you take into consideration all of the guests that would be arriving?\n\nAs a point of comparison, I have Jewish friends for whom not eating shellfish is a religious restriction and a Buddhist friend for whom eating any meat is a religious restriction. When we host gatherings they are attending, I make a point of including things that they can have so that they don't feel excluded or stuck with incredibly limited options.", "NTA who the hell goes to Louisiana and complains about crawfish.

And your Uncle's comment was probably indicative of the \"vibe\" she picked up on. She was polite enough not to make a big deal to you about it, she's not an asshole.\n\nAlso just noticed **both** main dishes had shellfish, another reason you're a bad host. And don't act like boudin was another choice for her, plenty of actual N.O people I know don't even eat it. <<I made crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, Cajun fettuccine, and husband made potato salad. We also had deviled eggs, cheese+fruit plate, boudin, and green beans brought by others.>>", "NTA for the the shellfish in the food but your father and uncle tease her about not being a \"real southern girl\" and being grossed out by shellfish and you don't see that as treating her as an outsider?", "NTA. You didn\u2019t trick her. She didn\u2019t bother to ask if there was shellfish in anything. I don\u2019t understand how she ate 2 servings without noticing the crawfish.", "NTA\n22 people, milling about, you busy with the food and everything else. It happened. As far as you tell us, it's not like you gave her something on purpose for a \"Gotcha!!\" moment.\n\nHad Brittni been allergic, then you should have made sure she knew what was in the dish. Now it was a matter that the thought of shellfish grossed her out and it turns out she actually likes it.", "YTA a bit.  Your dad and uncle certainly are.\n\nLook, she shouldn't say things like \"water roaches\" about food others like.  Though from the rest of your post I do wonder how far she was pressed on the matter of not wanting to eat it before she said that.\n\nHowever, this is a fettuccine dish, that's the base of the dish.  The shellfish is an add-in.  And a last-minute one because you had extra from your other dish!  So you're apparently fine with the concept of fettuccine without shellfish.  \n\nYou know she doesn't eat shellfish.  You could have portioned some out and set it aside for her.  This specific solution is an *easy* accommodation to make, it is not an unreasonable burden upon a host.  It's just being a good host.\n\nIt would have shown her some care.  Instead, all she gets is bullying.  In light of your uncle's comment, of course it feels like she was tricked - despite that you did not intend that.\n\n\nIn my family, macaroni salad is made with tuna.\n\nMy sister does not eat tuna.  Just doesn't like it.  No matter who was making the macaroni salad, we always set some aside for my sister which contained no tuna.\n\nIf we made macaroni and cheese and put tuna in it, again, we'd make sure my sister got a decent sized serving which did not contain any.\n\nIt's just not that difficult.  All it takes is a moment's thought.\n\nBrittni *is* being othered and singled out.  But she doesn't have to be.", "NTA\n\nShe had no seafood allergies so you didn't have to make it obvious.  There were other food alternatives,  like that sausage. \n\nSome  just have egos tied to beliefs. She believed she disliked something without trying it.

Now, if she had an allergy to shellfish, then that would be wrong. But she just doesn\u2019t like it- although she loved your pasta. You didn\u2019t harm her and you didn\u2019t do it intentionally.

Whatever someone's dietary needs/wishes/requirements/hated items are, it's on them to ask, and on the restaurant or home cook to let them know if a dish meets their requirements. She didn't ask; you didn't lie, and you didn't even see her until she'd had two bowls (I assume this was buffet style, like most cookouts). And from what I'm seeing online, the crawfish are very obvious in this dish.", "NAH.\n\nBased on what you wrote here, you did not hide it, you werent trying to trick her, you just forgot to mention it because you were busy. There was also plenty of other food for her to eat that did not contain shellfish, so its not like you set things up so she had no other choice.\n\nShe is being a bit dramatic since she seemed to enjoy it up until she learned what was in it, unless there is some other moral objection she has but hasnt shared. However, the comment from your uncle definitely could be interpreted as you guys trying to trick her. So, I kind of get where she is coming from too.", "NTA.

Firstly, there is a huge difference between a dietary restriction due to allergy/religious/moral beliefs and one because \"I don't like it\". The former reasons are real restrictions where the person has an objection to the food itself, whereas the latter is a childish indication of being unwilling to try new things. Brittni said she liked the food, and when she was told that there was crawfish in it, she had the same reaction a toddler would when they find out their food has vegetables in it.\n\nSecondly, it does not sound like op was intentionally excluding or tricking them. This is a party in Louisiana, for a Louisiana woman, and so op made Louisiana food. If I'm having a pig picking (a common large food gathering in my area) then the main food is going to be pig, whether or not my brothers gf likes pig or not. It's not her party, it's not for her and if she doesn't want to eat the food, she can bring her own, or not come.

Should OP be an accommodating host? Yes.

It sounds like OP was running around doing various things for the party and didn\u2019t even see Brittni before she already ate.\n\nSo while I will concede OP might not have been a polite host in the potential lack of accommodating a shellfish-free main, Brittni should still know that in a family that often serves shellfish and seafood dishes (especially in the South), that she needs to double check unless it\u2019s been made explicitly clear to her that the dish doesn\u2019t include the offending ingredients.", "Imagine being a *+1* to a family event with more than 22 people and having a big enough ego to believe the host went out of their way to trick you into eating a particular thing.
