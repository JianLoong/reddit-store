I initially thought that maybe it was food and it needed to be kept cold. however, when I opened the box, I saw a plastic bag with a fish in it. I was shocked and was lost for words. the friend who gave me the fish was telling me how she spent quite a lot of money on this fish and she hopes that I love it. \n\ndon't get me wrong, it was a beautiful fish, but under closer inspection, I realised that this was a salt water fish. I started panicking because I knew that I didn't have the proper equipments to properly take care of this fish, nor did I have the knowledge to do so.\n\nso I asked if she could possibly return this fish back to the shop because it wasn't possible for me to look after it. she got mad and started accusing me of purposely humiliating her infront of our friends. however, that wasn't my intention. I just didn't want the poor fish to stay in that bag any longer. plus, I also didn't want my friend's money to go to waste.\n\nAfter arguing back and forth, she ended up sending me the address of the fish shop and told me that if I really wanted to return it, I should just do it myself. \n\nwithin the next minute, I left the party and drove to the fish shop. thankfully, the pet store owner was kind enough to take back the fish and give my friend a refund.\n\nI thought things were back to normal, however, my friend is still angry with me for not being appreciative of the gift she gave me, and how it's the thought that counts. some of our friends agreed and said that I should've at least been a lil more considerate towards my friend, and that I really hurt her feelings.\n\nI personally don't think that I did anything wrong because its not that i was being ungrateful (I wouldn't have even cared if I had received nothing), I was just telling the truth and I didn't want the fish to suffer. when it comes to living things, I think my friend should've at least consulted me about this before buying the fish. just preparing a tank can take weeks so her giving me a fish out of no where caught me off guard.\n\nedit: yes, I know she had good intentions, but she shouldn't have bought a live animal without asking me. to her, it was just \"a fish\". things are still tense between us and I'm planning to talk to her later so I might update the situation if anything were to happen:)", "created_utc": 1667544548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylr6kj/aita_for_being_ungrateful_for_the_gift_that_my/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But this is a rare exception.\n\nI\u2019m sure she went in and picked out the prettiest fish with all the best intentions but no clue as to what it was or fresh vs salt water (live animals as gifts is a poor choice unless it\u2019s a passion you two share). Her feelings are hurt but you that was not your intention either. Perhaps sitting down with her and explaining that you were panicking and that the fish was dying in a baggie and why. That you appreciate the thought but you were also trying to save the fish\u2019s life.

She doesn't understand all this. Keeping the animal wrapped up in a present box for hours is quite creepy too.\n\nThe pet-shop owners are a bit to blame, they shouldn't sell a salt water fish so easily, without making sure the buyer understands the special care required.", "The gift was for YOU. It was not something that you wanted, needed or intended to care for. This is about you. Your birthday! She went with what she wanted instead of what would be wanted, valued and appreciated by you. She is making this about her when this is truly about you. You have the right to be honest with people about what you do not want or need.

I definitely think your friend overreacted because you cant be expected to buy a new tank for a saltwater fish, I can also understand that you left so soon to help the fish out, but I can maybe see why your friend was upset IF (big if) it SEEMED like you didnt appreciate the thought behind it and the cost of it. This ofcourse depends entirely on how you acted, your facial expression, comments etc. which could be misinterpreted. But all in all im on your side on this.", "True that. This is a perfect example of a friend not thinking beyond just \"fish\". Why she's mad when an ordinary person would have been embarrassed...her ego is getting in the way."]}
