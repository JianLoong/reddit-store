I was quite irritated but i tried to be civil and I told them to please leave me alone. Well they didn\u2019t. They kept following me and when i said it they made a comment like: \u2018oh look it can talk. Please keep your mouth shut. We don\u2019t feel like getting covid.\u2019 When they said that i\u2019ve had enough and told them to \u2018please leave me alone and get a life\u2019 they called me some more racist things but then max said: \u2018let\u2019s go to my house and disinfect our bodies\u2019 because of the covid comments.\nSteve agreed and i literally told steve: \u2018yes be a good little obedient slave and listen to your master or better yet retuurn to your own stinky country.

You stood up for yourself, good. but next time you know that you should take a dig at such people in another way", "Racist comments aren't just aimed at one person.

Their actions aren't excusable either but the double standard of them making racist comments but not being able to take it is stupid on their end.

Go to is just loudly yell at them to not be racists so everyone around you can see them for the assholes they are.", "NTA - you lashed out after being provoked, but more importantly you have the insight to know that what you said was wrong, and why it was wrong.

I wouldn\u2019t give it a second thought.", "NTA", "I'm going to go ESH, because of the situation.\n\nWas it wrong for them to do what they did, yes.

They definitely shouldn\u2019t have been racist, and I understand where you are coming from, but you can\u2019t just be racist, for any reason.

No matter how bad the slurs against you were, you don't ever use racist language.\n\nI admire your determination to stand up for yourself. It was a very ballsy move on your part. But you sank to their level, so everybody sucks.\n\nI would have preferred you kicking them in the balls tbh.", "ESH, two wrongs don't make a right. You're all just a bunch of racist.", "ESH you sunk to their level and that\u2019s not cool, but I can understand why it came to that. Use this experience as a live and learn", "Personally, NTA. Unless you meant what you said, in which ESH.\n\nIf I were faced with racism, I wouldn\u2019t just sit there and take it. Not that I want to attack someones race/ethnicity, but if someone is attacking you, I personally deem it okay to fight back just enough to deter them.", "ESH\n\nRacism is still racism when it's a response to racism. You should all be ashamed of yourselves.", "ESH but you a little less than the others. I don't want to sound clich\u00e9 but two wrongs don't make a right. You were upset that someone was being blatantly racist towards you but you knowingly said something racist back making you just as bad. It doesn't matter who started it first, racism is racism and is an awful trait to have. \n\nYou've learned your lesson and I hope next time someone is offensive towards you, you take the higher ground and either walk away, report them to the police or go for something witty like a classic \"your mum\" joke. \n\nDon't stoop to their level, be better than them.", "ESH you\u2019re no better than they are.", "ESH, but not gonna lie that was a savage comment.", "NTA\n\nI love the response, honestly. It sounds like someone needed to feel the same sting you were. It sucks that it came to that but sometimes people won't learn something hurts someone unless it hurts them first.", "NTA great comeback i would have never thought of that in the moment", "NTA. I don't understand the ESH here in the comments. You're a younger, smaller girl being harassed by two boys older and bigger than you who were escalating, I'm glad they ran away crying. While I hate racism what we're you supposed to do? Sounds like a scary situation.", "NTA\n\nWhile in itself an \"eye for an eye\" situation is not desirable, using the same force to retaliate as your aggressor is perfectly fine imo. You just responded to his attack, you didn't do it to be an asshole to them.", "NTA sounds like Steve can dish it out but can\u2019t take it.", "NTA - Kudos on you bravery.", "ESH. Yes, they were racist bullies, but don\u2019t stoop to their level. Tell them to sod off but leave racist tropes out of it.", "ESH\n\nThose two guys were psychotic.\n\nYou snapped and gave it back.\n\nThey were worse but it still sucks", "ESH sort of because it really is never okay to stoop to racist remarks. But you're a kid who got ganged up on by two older racists and you went low to make them stop. Your position is 1000% more understandable than theirs and it sounds like you already know it wasn't the best move. Don't lose any sleep over this. Those guys are massive assholes and are not worth worrying over. This moment does not in any way define you.", "ESH. I can completely see why you snapped, but as a POC yourself, you know how much this stuff hurts.", "ESH", "ESH - why did you reserve the racist comment for the black young man and not say anything to the white one? You said they were BOTH bothering you.", "ESH. Racism isn't an eye for an eye thing. Just call them assholes like a normal person lmao", "YTA, and all of you are assholes. Stop telling Black people to go back to their country. That Black person may even be a citizen of that country.\n\nThat said, I am always extremely surprised when I see members of oppressed groups act in a bigoted way.

You want to be better than this.\n\nThere are better ways to insult someone or respond to insults and stooping to their level isn't ideal.  That said, it worked.
