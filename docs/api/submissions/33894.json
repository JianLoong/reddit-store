Shortly after I agreed to do this for the family, the father of that family passed away. The mother doesn't have a license, and was overwhelmed with the death of her husband, and trying to raise two children on her own. So I just kept taking her kids to and from school for her.\n\n*Edit: She doesn't have a license because of some trauma she had when she caused a wreck as a teenager. She's afraid of even riding in a car, let alone driving it, and only rides in one reluctantly. Fortunately, we live in a city with public transportation, which she uses. She works in the opposite direction of our children's school, though, so it saved her a ton of time with me just driving them there, rather than her taking them there on public transportation.*  \n\nNext year, my son and her son are starting high school. (It's an all-boys' school. Her other kid, her daughter, is going to an all-girls' school.) Our sons will be going to the same high school, and I will be taking my son in the mornings. He will take the bus home in the afternoons.\n\nEven though I'm going that way anyway, and it wouldn't add any extra time to my commute, I just don't want to take her son in the mornings anymore. My regular commute is barely ten minutes each way, but I feel like that's 20 minutes of quality time with my own children that I've missed out on over the years, because it's just so awkward with someone else's kids in the car. My own kids don't really talk to me much until we drop off the other kids.\n\nMy kids think the other kids are \"weird.\" What my kids don't know, but I do know, because I'm their teacher, so I have the file, is that both of the neighbor's kids are on the spectrum, but barely. They just don't pick up on social cues. So yes, everyone thinks they're \"weird.\" I get it, because I'm an adult and a teacher. Kids don't understand it, though.\n\nStill, even though I could continue helping out a widowed neighbor with two kids who are on the spectrum by doing something I'm pretty much doing anyway, I just don't want to do it anymore. I want that quality time back with my own kids. I feel like I've done more than enough for that woman over the last eight years, considering that this all started with just a casual conversation between two guys who were just waiting for their kids to be dismissed from preschool.\n\n*Edit: There was some confusion about the kids. Only our sons are the same age. Her daughter is a year older than our sons, and I haven't been giving her a ride all year. My daughter is four years younger than our sons.*", "created_utc": 1703736019, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18skgp7/wibta_if_i_refused_to_take_the_widowed_neighbors/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is her responsibility to get her kid to school, she chose to have kids. Yes. It\u2019s harder on some of us, and that can mean extra hoops, expenses etc and while it feels frustrating and not fair at times, that is kind of life. That you\u2019ve given rides for 8 years is amazing and has saved her so much time and money! She ultimately should be grateful (mine is in before and after care, which is very expensive but is walking distance from my house even in snow so it\u2019s Nesc. ). But at this point , with the kids being older, it\u2019s actually going to be easier for her. They can bus, walk, ride bikes etc. and be so much more independent. It is going to be much easier to find a solution when they are 12+ than 5. \n\nGive her as much notice as you can. Expect maybe a small panic as she won\u2019t be expecting it and it could feel overwhelming at first hearing (not your fault. Emotions are real though but shouldn\u2019t be taken out on you).

Like can he not just ride the bus by himself?", "Having past trauma that she's been unable to get over while suffering from the additional trauma of losing her husband and parenting two kids with autism does not make her an asshole.", "It does if she doesn't get therapy to get over it enough to meet her kids' needs. Being able to drive your kids to school is a basic requirement, if you don't live somewhere your kids can get a bus. Sorry, but that's just how parenthood works. Either you overcome your weaknesses, or become TA for perpetuating them or causing your kids to lose out on basic needs like education. \n\nParenting is morally a very high stakes situation. People should think more about that before  having kids."]}
