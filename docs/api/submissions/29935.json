I dont know how old she is or her back story but that might play into it. She may have literally never experienced your parents type of insults. Im assuming theyre fairly cutting and hard to rebuttal if youre not on their level of elitist discourse. So this may be a learning moment for her that not all insults are as easily brushed off as she thought.\n\n- OP - I feel like the main thing with you is whether or not you properly warned her. Theres saying \"my parents are mean\" and then theres saying \"my parents will emotionally destroy you for sport\". You know how bad your parents are and im trusting you to judge whether or not you gave her enough info now in retrospect. I also think not standing up for her could go either way. Again, making assumptions, but im guessing that trying to argue with them is exactly what they want. They want you to get upset and then they can chastise you for your decorum or something. May be wrong but if you thought standing up for her would help would you have done it? Maybe this info could have also been part of her warning. Letting her know theres no saving her once shes in there.\n\n- Your Parents - Sound awful. Just like all around. Im sorry you have to deal with them.", "NTA. You warned her. Now treat her the way she should be treated. \n\nI feel your girlfriend would never have truly believed you about how bad your parents can be", "Well, she gave it a shot...  I would explain to her that you warned her and gave her the opportunity of not going and she wanted to go toe to toe with them...and lost.
