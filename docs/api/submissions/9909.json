Including 1) committing to finding a new therapist together (I see in your comments that you pulled her out of therapy as a minor -- you should have figured out a new therapist) and 2) enabling her a way to pay back the money as an alternative to honoring her commitment.\n\nYour child has an eating disorder and major anxiety. EDs are very hard to manage and take years to overcome, and coping strategies are important. If you force her to go, it's probably a crapshoot - she may be fine, or she may have a full blown ED relapse. Or she'll be unable to complete the trip and the guardian(s) involved will request her to be sent home.\n\nI had a life threatening ED that was triggered around your daughter's age that landed me in the hospital. I was away from home and didn't have the right support & resources. So I can say from personal experience -- consider offering her alternatives to going.", "Honestly, YTA just for having taken her out of therapy instead of working with her to find therapy that works better for her. \n\nYTA for a lot of other things too, but that's the one at the core of everything else. *Your daughter needs therapy.* \n\nShe also, frankly, needs somebody who will tell her that she can say no to you when she doesn't think something is good for her, because she has the right to make her own decisions now. That's something therapists are usually good at.\n\nThis wouldn't happen to have anything to do with why you took her out, would it?", "Let me get this straight. Your daughter has severe anxiety and an ED, neither of which she is working through because you took her out of therapy. She comes to you with her worries about relapsing according to your comments, and all you cared about was the money? The money she said she would pay back?\n\nIn what world aren't you TA.", "INFO\n\n> as the overnight trip came close, she began to get very anxious about it.\n\n> Every time someone brought the trip up, she would start sobbing inconsolably. \n\nAnd how did you address this change in demeanor with her mental health professionals?", "2 grand for an overnight trip? Seems like a lot. Her reaction was so strong here...and she offered to pay you back 2 grand....so she clearly does NOT want to go. Sounds like there is a lot going on here for her...that I'm inclined to think she should't be pushed to go.", "INFO: How much time is there between the agreement and the trip? How old is your daughter?", "YTA. 1. You know her history and issues and still dropped 2K on a non-refundable trip. 2. She's worried about relapsing,  which is a legitimate concern.  3. She obviously won't enjoy the trip or get much education out of it.  \nHOWEVER..she is legally an adult and did agree to go. Therefore,  you should come up with a payment plan and/contract to get your money back. And please get her back in therapy.", "After reading your comments, Jesus Christ dude, YTA", "YTA\n\nYou forced your daughter into a situation where she's is afraid it will trigger a relapse of her ED. You took her out of therapy last year.\n\nOf course you are TA", "YTA. When you found out she was feeling anxious as the trip approached, it\u2019d be better to talk through why she\u2019s feeling anxious or get her a therapist to talk through it with to potentially build up the strength to go. \n\nAs someone who has actively dealt with anxiety, depression and severe poverty\u2026 no matter how anxious I was I would force myself on a trip my mom paid for because she worked hard for it and I wasn\u2019t gonna let her down even if I felt like I wasn\u2019t gonna have a good time and guess what\u2026 all the anxiety leading up to it, wasn\u2019t nearly as bad when I got there and things typically were mostly fine and I had a good time. \n\nBut as the parent, I do wish my mom had been more helpful in the anxiety growing up so if she\u2019s being honest with you about that don\u2019t just force help her navigate through it or get a professional that can.", "YTA. You\u2019ll find out when they call you to pick her up. A kid without therapy and a parent who forces her to go to trips when she suffers from anxiety and depression just to teach her accountability? A recipe for success.", "YTA. I was in a similar situation when I was young. My mom had put down money for an overnight camp and she couldn't get the money back, but I had severe anxiety and changed my mind. She told me that we couldn't get the money back, so that needed to not be part of the equation anymore. If I wanted to go, I should go, and if it was going to make me miserable, going just meant that I was miserable and we were out the money, rather than us just being out the money. That was a really loving thing to do and I will appreciate it forever.", "YTA... You really consider your money is more important than your own kid's health huh. Taking her out of therapy, forcing her to go to the trip...", "YTA, if she's already this upset and crucially if she hasn't been able to overcome that in the past you're setting her and everyone else up for misery!", "~~INFO: Is your daughter in therapy?~~\n\nEdit: Found the other comments\n\nYTA\n\nYou are a HUGE asshole.   \n\nIf your child isn't making any progress with a given therapist, that may mean that the given therapist isn't making a successful connection with your child.  \n\nIt absolutely does not mean that your child cannot be helped through therapy.\n\nAnd of course given your other responses, it may mean that your expectations for her progress are unreasonable.", "I have a sister with a history of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and it sounds like to me that you have possibly gone years and years, like I have, wishing that your loved one would do just a little bit more to help themselves.

Your daughter needs professional guidance.", "YTA you should have just made her pay you back", "YTA and get your girl some therapy", "YTA - Forcing your daughter to go on this trip despite her mental health struggles will do more harm than good. It is essential to prioritize your daughter's mental and emotional health over any financial or other concerns. It is also incredibly appropriate and harmful to take your daughter out of therapy just because YOU think you're not seeing progress. You need to be a much better person and better parent.", "Yes.

Your daughter is obviously not ready to leave home and you should get her professional help. If she worries about relapsing her ED, that is serious stuff.

Her behavior is not normal.", "NTA you should make her go. I think she would find out she will be okay and it may ease some anxiety. \n\nI read some of your comments about her other concerns. She is going to have to continue to work through them. You said she doesn\u2019t like how one of her meds made her feel, well - there are a few hundred others for her to try. It takes time and effort but it will be worth it. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t start really putting in an effort now, she is not going to make it through some next critical steps in life like college, jobs, general travel. \n\nTherapy, therapy, therapy.", "NTA She needs to learn to follow through on her commitments. If she's that messed up she needs therapy to learn strategies to overcome her anxiety.", "NTA. One of the hardest parts of being a parent is teaching your kids to follow through on their commitments and the fact that it's so expensive honestly makes it an easier decision.", "NAH - and I don't think your verbiage was right. If she's 18, you're not FORCING her but encouraging her and she's CHOSING to abide by it or not so no force is to be had. People need to make sure they understand that.\n\nYou're doing what I wish someone had done for me, encouraging her out of her comfort zone. Growing up with crippling anxiety, depression and PTSD made me miss out on so many things as a child and teenager. It may seem harsh to her now, but hopefully it'll be a core memory she will enjoy later in life. Anxiety is a beast, and often best faced head on.\n\nI have read other replies and people have a point about not trying to make things worse for someone who is already mentally struggling but that isn't for us to judge from this distance. That is up to the parents to see what the limits are. I was enabled to fester in my anxiety and depression and it left me with no memories, missed opportunities, little to no friends and so much more damage. Meanwhile, I had a scenario where my mother was firm I did something even though I didn't want to, and I was mad as hell at the time but in hindsight, it was the right thing to do. You have to think long term, not right now. Especially for mental health situations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Upon further reading and people talking about EDs (Which I also have, before anyone gets snippy about commenting on it) , I still don't think OP is the asshole. Maybe a bit misguided and needs to really focus on getting their child help if they can't do it on their own (which is likely given the anxiety). But you can't avoid your triggers forever. You have to face the fact that anything at any given time has a chance to trigger something within you. Look at combat veterans with PTSD. They still have to live their lives knowing that the most unexpected, minute thing could send them on a spiral.", "NAH- Obviously if you paid that much money and she said she was going to go, you want her to go. However, if she's that anxious about it you have to understand she's not thinking clearly, she's probably having panic attacks about it and going into fight or flight mode.  I don't know how to describe how that feels but it's like her brain is telling her that the world will definitely end if she goes on that trip. Does she have any specific concerns to address (not knowing anyone in the group, unsure about accomodations, safety concerns?)\n\n\n I saw another comment where you said you took her out of therapy because it didn't help, honestly based on personal experience only, I'd see if she wants to try a psychiatrist to possibly talk about medication. It should all be her decision. It's possible it wasn't the right therapist or type of therapy for her too.", "NTA. I remember how hard a lesson this was to learn as a child. But it is an important one. You follow through on your commitments.", "NTA. $2000 is a lot of money and she shouldn\u2019t have made you fork out so much money only to pull a stunt like this. Ridiculous. And it\u2019s a given that she wouldn\u2019t pay you back for it despite her claims. The world is not going to cater to her anxieties.

If her parents have continued to behave as though they have authority over her, and they took her out of therapy shortly before she turned 18 so she has nobody who could point this out to her and encourage her to start thinking about whether she wanted to follow her parents' recommendations or not, she might genuinely not have realized. Age of majority is a pretty abstract term until you really begin to grasp that it applies to *you*. \n\nIn my experience, it's often up to parents (especially with kids who have a lot of other issues they are focusing on) to point out that their child is an adult now, and encourage them to start asking their parent for advice if they want it, but not for permission.

Even with the right help it can take years to fully recover from, and even from your own very biased telling, your daughter definitely hasn't recovered from it. You're worried about how she acts, and you're worried about college and her future, so why don't you work on helping her recover from the illness that's causing a lot of the problems? You wouldn't complain that she couldn't run a marathon if she had a broken leg (... would you?), you'd take her to the doctor and get it treated, knowing that marathon running would only be possible with two working legs. This is the same, except anorexia is much more likely to kill her.", "Wow. She talks consistently about fear of relapsing, but you pulled her out of therapy because she \"wasn't making any progress\", and speak callously about how she \"hasn't stopped eating like she did before.\" So... if she comes back from the trip and she *has* stopped eating like she did before, what are you going to do about it? Are you going to feel guilty or bad at all? Because it would be entirely your fault.\n\nYTA. Be a better parent and get your daughter back in therapy ASAP.", "Exactly what I said too", "Honestly, knowing her, she\u2019ll probably come back from this trip crying that she ate too much. I really doubt that she\u2019d ever stop eating again.", "If she came back from the trip crying that she ate too much, that would also be a type of relapse of her ED. She is supposed to be working towards having a more positive and safe attitude towards food and eating. Crying that she ate too much would be relapsing into disordered thinking about her food consumption. You \"really doubt\" that she'd ever stop eating again, and yet your daughter is consistently afraid of relapsing, and you don't seem to care that it is even a *possibility* that she might stop eating again and does not have any medical or therapy support to help her if that happened.\n\nYou are a horrible parent and have no empathy (or even genuine concern) for your daughter's mental health and well-being.", "Dude im 100000000000000% sure your daughter hates you", "You sure she hasn't become bulimic? That'll kill her too, and it'll destroy her teeth and her esophagus on the way, too."]}
