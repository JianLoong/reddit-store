She knows what it's like to be pregnant.  She was the one who was rude by picking on you in front of everyone over a non-existent dress code in your own home, and your husband is her willing doormat.  Explain to your hubs there really is such a thing as \"pregnancy brain\" and he knows how difficult this pregnancy is for you.  Your hormones are all over the place. You can't be expected to \"rise to the occasion\" and act civil when she chose to embarrass you as she did, knowing full well your situation.  Your SIL turned 16.

Sometimes women want to have sex a few weeks after giving birth too.", "My husband made a giant red circle on our calender and put in all caps \"SEX DAY!!!!!\" multiple exclamation points included, for the day exactly 8 weeks after I gave birth to our son.\n\nI knew he was trying to be sweet but after my traumatic and exhausting birth, and now trying to handle a poorly latching newborn, I was NOT looking forward to it.\n\nThen the day arrived and, despite being completely exhausted, suffering from horrible PPA and PPD and in terrible pain, I tried to perform \"the wifely duties.\"\n\nMy husband drops trou and I see his big ol' balogna wand (my husband would make a size queen very happy. I'm not a size queen) and I just start *bawling.* Like ugly, snot pouring out, scream crying sobbing. I was still in so much pain after my birth, my stiches hadn't fully healed (even though it was only a second degree tear) and I was so damn tired and covered in various baby liquids and soaked in milk.\n\nIt was just an absolutely unbearable moment and the thought of that giant thing going in there was terrifying. Cue total and complete meltdown. Thank god my husband has some semblance of decency and immediately put his clothes on and gave me a cuddle and some food and let me take a nap instead without whining, pouting or a word of complaint.\n\nI don't think we did it until a month or two after that and even then we did it like mormon kids: just the tip and no thrusting.\n\nPostpartum sex can be really awful, discombobulating and scary for awhile.", "I mean for the question in itself OP is NTA. She is sick, feels like shit mentally and physically, you can't expect her to go play dress up and be nice for guests she did not expect/wanted in her home.\n\nBut for the pregnancy, for so far it seems both are to blame.", "She\u2019s 3 months pregnant I don\u2019t think that\u2019s allowed in any state.", "Good question! I don't know.\n\nTo be entirely honest I have trouble remembering the English anatomy sometimes so I might even be mistaken about what exactly the pelvic floor is exactly, though I know I am at least very close", "I think you misread something. She has not currently been banging for 3 months. In order for her to be pregnant for as long as she is, she would have gotten pregnant WAY before the medically required 6 weeks postpartum. This means that whether she wanted to or not (this wasn't stated), she had sex almost immediately after giving birth, which is incredibly dangerous, and that sex led to pregnancy which is even more dangerous. And to top it off, she most likely has post partem depression. I'm honestly surprised that she hasn't been hospitalized.", "Also apparently you're way more fertile directly after birth too.", "Actually, pregnancy should be counted from last period, so that would put conception at almost exactly 6 weeks after giving birth.  but yeah, I suspect he had a countdown or something going.", "Most doctors advise 6 weeks or until you feel comfortable. Most will okay it before 6 weeks if you\u2019re up for it and no longer experiencing lochia.", "I would venture to say the apple didn't fall far from the tree here.", "Yeah three **MONTHS** not weeks.", "It can sometimes be a legal gray area where she agrees just because she thinks it\u2019s her job. So it\u2019s not real consent, but it also isn\u2019t rape in the legal sense of the word", "Gosh that\u2019s awful, I\u2019m sorry. Glad it didn\u2019t have to happen", "Wow. I'm glad your husband was so understanding and didn't make an issue of it. We definitely waited more than 6/8 weeks before resuming sexual activity.", "We tried for five years. Nadal. Zip. Nilch. \n\nI have had health issues, and after so long of unprotected sex, having schedules, no schedules, and everything in between, it was decided we couldn't have kids.  \n\nSo we kept having unprotected sex. We weren't trying, we were having enjoyable sex without the hassle of protection (not that it is a bad hassle, but certainly can be annoying) \n\nA few years later, we were definitely surprised when I was pregnant.", "Yeah it is just hard to imagine someone actively wanting sex only a few weeks after pregnancy, but it is possible", "Well I don\u2019t really get that vibe from OP. I more think she is exhausted and burned out.", "What? You don\u2019t think she should have access to healthcare? I do.", "In my country its allowed up to 24 weeks or longer if there are health concerns for the mother. It's the same in california, i havent googled anywhere else. This is 5 to 6 months pregnant.", "Some risks include placental abruption and schizophrenia. Yikes", "Mayo clinic advises waiting 18-24 MONTHS between pregnancies. OP was in single digit WEEKS.", "I'll be honest, I had ten and a bit months between pregnancies and it is *not* long enough. I'm barely halfway in and my pelvis *hurts* because my tendons never finished tightening back up. (They don't till you're done making milk! Un-fun fact there.)\n\nIt's also hell on your teeth and bones because you haven't rebuilt your reserves before being sucked dry again.", "And given OP\u2019s got fertility issues, it\u2019s highly possible that it\u2019s even more dangerous than it would be for someone who didn\u2019t. Depending on what\u2019s causing those issues.", "Oh had no idea, I thought it was four months. Thank you for the info :)", "It annoys me to see people stay and reproduce with such assholes. Imagine having the audacity to say child care isn\u2019t a man\u2019s job to a person who is three months pregnant while taking care of a four month old. And then berating her for not wearing nice clothes? I mean what?", "I\u2019m just thinking, what the fuck? To this entire post.", "Pregnancies are dated to last menstrual period, whic is often about 2 weeks before the sex that actually results in he pregnancy. So I envision he jumped on her right after her 6 week checkup.", "I was trying to do the math on this too and I think maybe she could have been 6 weeks postpartum when they had sex. If pregnancy math counts from the beginning of your last period, there is usually an extra two weeks in there between when you have your period and ovulate. Now she just gave birth so it's unlikely that she had a real period but if she is 12 weeks pregnant based on normal standards, she probably conceived about 10 weeks ago when she was about 6 weeks postpartum.\n\nStill really bad and scary but this thought makes me less nauseous. Poor op, regardless of when it happened that is very very early to be pregnant again and I can't imagine going through that", "That\u2019s only if you assume precisely 4 months and precisely 3 months.  Say son is a bit over 4 months - if your months include May through September, exactly 4 months is already 17 weeks plus 4 days.  And if OP is just shy of 12 weeks but generalizing to 3 months, you\u2019re at 6 weeks.  It\u2019s still too soon for a pregnancy, which OP concedes, but that doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t cleared.  It\u2019s also quite possible they jumped the gun, but OP would need to clarify - and may not care to share that.", "Maybe try to not generalise womens bodies after birth. Not one is the same - I know of women who had sex a couple of days after giving birth and I know of women who waited months. \n\nAll doctor\u2019s recommendations I have heard is dependant on whether there\u2019s been tearing or trauma requiring intervention. Most of the time they say \u201cwhen you\u2019re comfortable\u201d\n\nMy mum got pregnant again when I was 2 months. She hates my dad with a passion now, so if he\u2019d forced her, she wouldn\u2019t have shut up about it. She was perfectly fine with sex at that point. \n\nOP might have been okay with sex that soon after birth. We don\u2019t know, so everything beyond that is pure speculation.", "After my first kid, I felt similarly sore. After my second, I didn\u2019t even need Tylenol. Every birth is different.", "OP doesn't put weeks in, but I got 6 weeks from birth to conception (conception is actually in week 2 or 3 of pregnancy).", "It probably would have been ok after my second one, she just sort of wiggled out one morning before breakfast without much damage, but definitely not after my first one, I had stitches, bruising and at 4 weeks I was still bleeding as well.\nBut we don't know who initiated there and how she felt.", "This is the sort of thing that's killed countless women throughout history", "I'm not an expert here but isn't there such a procedure called a Cesarean delivery (C-section)? And wouldn't this leave everything intact?", "Coercion is rape, I found some more definitions \n\n>Sexual coercion is unwanted sexual activity that happens when you are pressured, tricked, threatened, or forced in a nonphysical way.\u00a0Coercion can make you think you owe sex to someone. It might be from someone who has power over you, like a teacher, landlord, or a boss. No person is ever required to have sex with someone else\n\n>Sexual coercion, for example, happens when someone pressures or manipulates you into having sexual contact when you don\u2019t want to.\n\nAnd if you search sexual coercion illegal, a bunch of laws and attorneys pop up.", "that\u2019s a great point i didn\u2019t consider!", "Those seem wildly different.", "Yeah, beyond the pale for sure. I truly can't fathom how people end up with such a neat little idea of what the world should look like, and then be legitimately surprised/unable to see why they're in the wrong when it doesn't conform to their self-centered ideals.   \n\n\nWhy can't we all just sit and have a perfect little dinner party, I don't see what the problem is???  \n\n\nYeah that's clear, monster in law and son. Very clear.", "I forgot about that. Everything about this is so messed up. Poor OP and poor kids. Repeated pregnancies close together combined with PPD and terrible spouse/in-laws is a recipe for disaster. I just want to be her fairy, fucking grandmother who goes in and tells spouse/in-laws to get lost or start supporting this poor girl and these kids. MIL, you want to see a \"scene\"?

They are very different but they're both risks.", "I like you, you're a good human.", "So if OP has been told by her doctor that she can have sex whenever she is comfortable and she wanted to have sex, it doesn\u2019t matter because she absolutely needs 6 weeks to heal? \n\nNah. That makes no sense. I\u2019d go after what I got told by medical professionals and if they said whenever you feel ready, that\u2019s what I\u2019d trust.
