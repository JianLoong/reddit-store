She knows what it's like to be pregnant.  She was the one who was rude by picking on you in front of everyone over a non-existent dress code in your own home, and your husband is her willing doormat.  Explain to your hubs there really is such a thing as \"pregnancy brain\" and he knows how difficult this pregnancy is for you.  Your hormones are all over the place. You can't be expected to \"rise to the occasion\" and act civil when she chose to embarrass you as she did, knowing full well your situation.  Your SIL turned 16.
