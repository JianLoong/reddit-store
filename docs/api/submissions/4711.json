Your MIL laid the groundwork for your reaction by opening up her pie hole in the first place.  If she didn't say anything, no one would have cared about how you dressed.  She knows what it's like to be pregnant.  She was the one who was rude by picking on you in front of everyone over a non-existent dress code in your own home, and your husband is her willing doormat.  Explain to your hubs there really is such a thing as \"pregnancy brain\" and he knows how difficult this pregnancy is for you.  Your hormones are all over the place. You can't be expected to \"rise to the occasion\" and act civil when she chose to embarrass you as she did, knowing full well your situation.  Your SIL turned 16.

Being pregnant already has to be hard on not only your body, but also your mind. 4 month olds need a lot of care.  It does sound like post partum depression. But, it could be even more complicated being pregnant again. \n\nI didn't even pay attention to what I wore when my kid was 4 months old. If I was pregnant with a 4 month old, I'd probably forget to get dressed. \n\nNTA", "Oh jeez honey, that is not OK, and it is *absolutely* his fault he chooses not to be a parent.\n\nI hope you are talking to your therapist about having zero support at home. I'm sure you're well aware that having to \"nag\" him to contribute is exhausting in itself. It may have been normalised to you, but there are men in the world who contribute equally - and a lot more who at least try to.", "Why on earth would have a second child with someone who refuses to parent the one you already have?", "100% he can help it, it\u2019s his choice. He has the mother of his children that he needs to put first, which he did not do for this event. Love, you should have been first priority that evening, and he should have told his family that y\u2019all weren\u2019t going to be able to make it. You are not only recovering from birth, you\u2019re pregnant again. And every single pregnancy can be worlds different for the same woman. I conceived when my baby was 14 months. Vastly different experiences, and I was so sick for half of it. I\u2019m sorry your partner isn\u2019t supportive of you. You deserve better, and you should demand it. Consider showing him this post and comment threads. If he has any sense, he\u2019ll want to do better for you and your kids.\n\nOn your health: please be as proactive as you can be. Start requesting regular labs to make sure all of your hormones are in check and producing like they should. Even after this next baby is born. So many women on here can share tales of how mystery crashes of certain hormones or vitamins that our bodies produce can destroy us. Feel free to dm me if you would like a big sister/mama place to vent.", "You shouldn't have to NAG him to take care of his own child!!!! He should do it willing. He took part in making both babies. Now, he doesn't even want to care for them unless you nag him. Where does his priority lie? You being the homemaker and childcare provider while he works? Unless you agree to that, then so be it. But if you didn't, why are you putting yourself and mental health through this.", "Yes?!?!?! My BIL does 50%+ WITHOUT ASKING and they both work full time. It's called parenting. It IS his fault his mother babies him, he is a grown ass adult and he needs to put his foot down and be a parent and a partner to you. Can you honestly imagine nagging your husband for the next 18+ years to be a parent? Hope you wanted 3 kids, because that's what you've got.", "So you spent 3 years trying to get pregnant with this person because ?", "It is his fault for not growing up and realizing that he shouldn't have been babied, though. At some point, you have to become an adult and realize it's time to stop blaming your parents.", "so you have two children and a third on the way. im so sorry you have to deal with that. he and his mother sound awful and they are both TA but you are NTA", "Right??", "This right here! DRs recommend at least 6 weeks to give the mothers body a chance to heal. I feel like there\u2019s no way within 4 weeks postpartum she\u2019s was feeling sexy and wanting anything to do with that. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this", "Right? I read that part and was going no. Why. No.", "Not necessarily. My sister got pregnant three months after having her son and she freely admits it was her coming on to him. We have no idea how she felt after first pregnancy and if he forced it", "You're accusing a man of sexual assault because his wife is pregnant too quickly after giving birth. Beautiful.", "Exactly. Like I do feel for the SIL, 16th birthdays are kind of big in a lot of cultures and this did make her bday dinner awkward, but it is absolutely not OP\u2019s fault. The family didn\u2019t need to accommodate her for the birthday, they should\u2019ve just stuck with the original plan and let OP miss it if she was feeling sick.", "That's called rape. Not \"forcing themselves\" and they should be reported", "It\u2019s usually 6 weeks to have intercourse because the placenta leaves a dinner plate sized wound in your uterus. They don\u2019t want the new mom to end up with an infection. 12 months after vaginal and 18 after C-section to get pregnant so you don\u2019t potentially wreck your body.", "This, plus a lot of people don\u2019t know that you can get pregnant that soon after giving birth, or that there may be heightened fertility immediately afterwards.", "i get that but why even risk it by having sex if you didn\u2019t want to get pregnant again? i know many people divorce pregnancy from just enjoying sex, but (hopefully) we all know that unprotected sex has the chance to lead to making a child.\n\ni\u2019m similarly shocked when i hear about people who say they weren\u2019t trying for a baby and were surprised with a pregnancy but they were actively having sex with no birth control. if that\u2019s not trying for a baby then what is?", "Ah, thank you! It just baffles me that people immediatly jump to blame the husband for OP being pregnant again, when no where I saw anything hinting at him forcing himself on OP or anything.", "On top of having to take care of a crying baby, being sleep deprived. Having a new born is hard enough, you're a rock OP! Hang in there \u2764\ufe0f", "exaclty abortion and foster care are still options", "Jesus Christ Reddit.", "not really lots of parents hate thier kids", "you can\u2019t just appericiate your way out of Post Partum *DEPRESSION*. people with depression aren\u2019t lazy or taking life for granted. they are sick and struggling. imagine you had asthma and everyone told you that there\u2019s plenty of air just breathe. life doesn\u2019t work that way. OP is getting help from a professional and trying to resolve their problems. grow up and stop diminishing people\u2019s problems.", "Everything about pregnancy sucks and people should be allowed to feel that way without being chastised.", "They also recommend not having pregnancies this close because it can be extra dangerous and damaging for the woman.", "My math says this pregnancy was conceived 4 weeks after OP gave birth. Having had two kids, everything down there was only sort of healed at 6 weeks after birth which is why they recommend no sex for at least 6 weeks. My bits cringed reading that. It's not impossible she was okay for sex at 4 weeks, but it's unlikely.", "It usually is reported but unless the wife is willing to cooperate with law enforcement, it goes nowhere", "\u201cTrying for a baby\u201d looks way different for people who have struggled with infertility compared with people who haven\u2019t.\nIf you went from carefully scheduling sex during ovulation, having hormone injections, having your guy wearing loose-fitting pants, taking your temp every morning before getting out of bed, etc. for months and finally, maybe, getting pregnant without having to resort to IVF then just raw dogging from time to time probably doesn\u2019t seem like \u201ctrying\u201d to get pregnant.", "> they were actively having sex with no birth control. if that\u2019s not trying for a baby then what is?\n\nIt's usually referred to as \"not trying not preventing\" (NTNP) but I get what you mean.", "I think she was saying it\u2019s ok if OP decided to get an abortion, because without the stress and misery of being pregnant again, it would be easier to focus on her 4 month old.  Yes PPD doesn\u2019t magically disappear but if she eliminates other stressors in her life, it can certainly help.", "No, it seems entirely appropriate and necessary. The premise of this subreddit is asking advice from total strangers anyway.", "That's fair, but not calling it what it is, downplays the severity", "\u2026about specific scenarios.
