Go forth, sister.", "So, I was groomed and SA when I was a teen, and the first person I told when I was in my 20s found a way to take advantage of me, of isolating me from my family and using me in other ways. This second person was 36 when I was 20 and yes, we were dating. \n\nThankfully, this second person drew me to my now husband. I don't know how I opened my eyes and managed to get out. \n\nWhen I had been married for a couple of years, I again felt victimized by a person of power, and that got me thinking. This new person didn't know about my previous abusers, what in hell did they see in me that they thought I would take the abuse? Was I that visibly vulnerable ? I went back to therapy, my husband helped me 200%, and then we got pregnant with our first. \n\nI didn't know their gender until the day they were born, but in those eight months expecting my child, I promised myself I would love them so much, so strongly, so intensively, that they would be vulnerable to no one. They would know from their first memory, that they could come to their mother, and I would believe them, support them, help in any way needed, but above all, be honest with them. \n\nI have a son and a daughter in their mid 20s now. My daughter's female friends come to me with their problems, and if I can't help them, at least they have the right words and tools to talk to their parents. My son's female and male friends have my phone number and ask for advice sometimes. \n\nI cannot list to you the ways my kids are everything emotionally, that I wish I could have been. They take international flights alone without fear. They introduce the ex-gf to the new gf and then proceed to get brunch together. They wear skimpy clothing because it's freaking hot outside. \n\nBy the way, we live and my kids were born in our third world country, labeled the second most dangerous in the world or something like that. \n\nI'm sorry I got so intense.

They deserve so much more. And yes, you decided to bring them into your world, it's your duty to provide for them. \n\nYou sound smart and educated, you can get a job anywhere you choose to go. You're choosing to stay because you think you're comfortable. That sounds selfish.
