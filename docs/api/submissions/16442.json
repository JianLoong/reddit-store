We where playing a drinking game and she asked me a truth or dare so I said truth. She then asked me to name a man I was attracted to (I came out a a lesbian when I was 16) she knows I am a lesbian so I told her I am not attracted to men. She couldn\u2019t wrap her head around it and kept insisting that I found at least some men attractive. I brushed this comment off because I could see how she would be genuinely curious about it. At this point I still believed she ment no harm. Then later she dared me to kiss my friend (a man) who had always been open about being sexually attracted to me. I told her I wouldn\u2019t be doing that. This dare hurt me because I previously had discussed my friendship with him to her because I felt sexualized in that friendship and I was at a point to end that friendship. However I discussed it with that friend and he gave a genuine apology and told me he would stop making sexual comments. And he never did again. So for my friend/coworker to insinuate such thing is just a big question mark to me. She then asked me who of the male friends attending I would sleep with if I had no choice. That question is already wrong on manny levels..no choice?! I said none because dying was always a choice. My friends laughed and we moved on. When everyone went home I felt really shitty so I typed op a message to my friend/coworker to tell her that she made me uncomfortable. I decided to send the text next morning since it was late and we had all been drinking. So next morning I send the text, she blames the alchohol and tells me she ment no harm. I told her alchohol is no excuse to disrespect someone and then she flipped because she didn\u2019t like me using the word disrespect. I explained that making someone uncomfortable and sexualizing them is disrespectful. I then said \u201ci know you won\u2019t understand this completely but trying to force lesbians to do and say straight things for your entertainment is not only disrespectful but also harmful\u201d she send me about 7 messages and I could read some of it trough my notifications and I can tell she\u2019s pretty pissed of. I haven\u2019t open them yet. \n\nSo am I the asshole for saying she disrespect me?\n\nAlso I know I probably shouldn\u2019t be friends with the man who sexualizes me but I\u2019ve known him since I was 6 and this behavior only started recently so I am still debating our friendship)\n\nEdit: no one was drunk it was a game night with some friends and a drink. However the coworker is a lightweight so I took that into account by sending the text the next morning.\n\nUPDATE:\nshe keeps denying and coming up with excuses here are some: \nHer: I wanted to proof a kiss doesn\u2019t mean anything \nMy response: why use me to proof your point and especially with the guy you know sexualizes me. \n\nHer: it\u2019s unfair to me that you say it\u2019s disrespectful I\u2019ve always been trying to be mindful.\nMy response: I appreciate your mindfulness but that doesn\u2019t mean you can never be in the wrong. I know this is new to you (sexuality and how you navigate it) but I think it\u2019s important to let you know when you are being disrespectful so you can learn from it. I am not mad and this is no personal attack. \n\nHer: I am blocking you I told you it wasn\u2019t disrespectful why can\u2019t you get that?!", "created_utc": 1683281910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138hcae/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_disrespected_me/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've been clear about your sexuality, about your boundaries and about what you didn't like; she forced you to do and say things that were not in line with that and she crossed your boundaries and it WAS disrespectful. \n\nShe's pissed off because you called her out and some people don't like that. If she can't genuinely apologize for her behavior and is blaming the alcohol, then you know what kind of a person she is; those are her true colours. You just expressed how her actions made you feel. \n\nAlso as a lesbian myself, this made me uncomfortable to read... so I can't imagine the genuine disrespect you felt in person.", "NTA -\n\nWTH!! Just reading it i feel uncomfortable! She was so inappropriate, disrespectful, and gross on so many level.She might want to blame alcohol for her behavior. That's only to dismiss her responsibility of her own behavior. NO! She didn't means to disrespect so she refuse to be accountable for her own actions? She isn't done learning how to behave, however she isn't an elementary schooler not knowing any better reproducing BS from home.\n\nShe showed you who she really is. Beleive it. You should be the one pissed of. She have no ground to be.I doubt it would be pleasant to have her around. She isn't friend material, and definitly not toward you.\n\nedit: spacing", "NTA. You repeatedly asked her not to make ignorant comments and then addressed it correctly the next morning rather than potentially getting into a drunken argument. If I\u2019d have been in your friend\u2019s position I\u2019d have been mortified for making you feel this way and so she doesn\u2019t sound great to be honest.", "NTA your friend sounds homophobic.", "NTA. Disrespect is the perfect word for it actually. She blatantly disrespected you. Even if alcohol was a good excuse (and it\u2019s not), she would still need to take responsibility for her behavior.", "NTA, absolutely not.\n\nPeople who throw tantrums to try and convince others they're not to blame are wild to me. The only thing you're convincing anyone of is that you're an immature baby who doesn't want to take responsibility for anything.\n\nEven if she only said those things because she was drunk, she still said those things and she needs to take responsibility for them. Acknowledge and apologize and show remorse. If you run someone over accidentally you still ran them over - things don't have to be intentional for them to be harmful.\n\nShe sounds like she thinks she's entitled to your forgiveness (she isn't) and gets to dictate how you feel about her actions (she doesn't) because she thinks you're calling her a bad person by pointing out she did a bad thing.\n\n(also your friend sounds like he's trying to change so I don't think it's wild to give him a chance with new boundaries in place)", "NTA - at all. I would not invite this coworker to anything anymore. I mean, you can talk to her about it and hopefully work through it, but I would be concerned about how she might affect my work environment, if I were you. If she says inappropriate things at work, you can report her to HR, but if she says them when you're out drinking with friends, you don't have that option and I would not want to give her any chances to bully me again, because let's be honest, that's what she was doing.", "NTA this was uncomfortable to read so to go through it? Yikes.", "NTA. She crossed a line. You define where that line lies and not anybody else. Also alcohol might be a reason but definitely not an excuse.", "She was disrespectful to you. \n\nNTA", "Her behaviour was disgraceful and disrespectful and alcohol is no excuse.\n\nShe sounds like she was fetishising the whole situation. How would she feel if you were asking those questions but of her sleeping with a woman? \n\nReally shitty way to spoil a night out. She is not your friend and not a nice person, lacking even the basic courtesy to sincerely apologise instead of getting pissed at you. NTA", "That's so creepy. Sounds like a homophobe in disguise to me. NTA. You need to spell these things out to people, or they'll keep happening.", "NTA, your coworker sounds like she\u2019s got some issues going on.", "NTA. She does not need to understand your sexual preferences, she only needs to respect them. Which she does not.", "Yeah NTA, if your friend wants to not be held accountable with ordinary words of accountability, she can police herself better.", "NtA.  She was disrepectful.  You spoke the truth.  Also, please realize she is not your friend and stop hanging out with her.  That is NOT how friends behave.", "YTA. I think you took the game a little too seriously. Sounds like you need to lighten up, don\u2019t play truth or dare if you can\u2019t handle it. Also to defuse the situation you could have just said Brad Pitt\u2026you didn\u2019t need to go all septic about it.", "To me the asshole is\u2026 the drinking game itself! Always a bad idea! (Especially if some people are susceptible on one side, and super taxing / unsubtle on the other side).\n\nGood you told her OP, but you could have told her in front of everyone! \u201cWe got it. Not funny Miranda!\u201d\nOr \u201c\ud83d\ude44 Brad Pitt\u201d - hopefully she would have get it\n\nBtw: loved the \u201cdying is always an option\u201d \ud83d\ude05 I think it\u2019s hilarious as an answer \n\nBtw2: even if you are homo/hetero, to me it is always strange not to be able to tell you is beautiful from the sex you are not attracted to. Many men can\u2019t say a man is beautiful because \u2018no homo\u2019. Yet many hetero women can tell a woman is beautiful\u2026 there might be homophobia behind this?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is your own fault.
