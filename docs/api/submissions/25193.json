You\u2019re friends are your friends, not necessarily hers. There\u2019s nothing in the marriage handbook that says she has to like them or be friends with them. And their opinion of her is based a lot on what you say about your wife. Don\u2019t get angry with her when she is doing what she likes while you have your friends over.

Ok, I'm taking a step back here to speak to these points with less ire: you said she recently graduated with her masters. So there are at least two degrees she's obtained that needed to be paid for. I don't know how those were financed, but it sounds like she was involved in the payments as that's most often the case with people who work while in school. So if nothing else, there's that to drive her to work for more than housing, and the amenities most people would list for today's Western middle class (i.e. phone, internet, cable/subscriptions, possibly car, various insurances, possibly vacations, side entertainments like eating out/movies/etc.) Additionally, as she is self-employed, she may want to contribute to a retirement fund. Not sure if you all have or are planning to have kids, but perhaps she wants to save for them as well?\n\n\"No one asked her to.\" Ok. Have you two talked about the way you want to live? Many people don't like to live with a great deal of unpaid debt gaining interest over their head and many like to have as much space as they can comfortably afford to live their everyday lives. So while you may not have asked her to do so, to live at a level she wants to live at (debts that have regular payments made and an end in sight, creature comforts in terms of type of housing and comfortable accessories), she may well need to work as she does, even if no one (i.e. you) didn't ask her to. If you very strongly feel like she is working unnecessarily on your behalf, you should discuss all the things you'd like to cut out of your current lifestyle so that she can work less. However, though I hope you already know that this is obvious, she may prefer to work more so she/you can have an do things that you wouldn't be able to afford otherwise.

That perhaps they give her a sense of satisfaction and purpose entirely separate from the monetary satisfaction? Have you considered that or talked to her about that? If she hates her Etsy shop and has secretly wanted to close it up, but has only been grinding so hard because she wants to help you out of your debt, cool, then maybe she will happily hear that you want her to work less and you all can rework the finances so that she sells less and you both live with less and your credit score stagnates instead of improving.
