You\u2019re friends are your friends, not necessarily hers. There\u2019s nothing in the marriage handbook that says she has to like them or be friends with them. And their opinion of her is based a lot on what you say about your wife. Don\u2019t get angry with her when she is doing what she likes while you have your friends over.

Ok, I'm taking a step back here to speak to these points with less ire: you said she recently graduated with her masters. So there are at least two degrees she's obtained that needed to be paid for. I don't know how those were financed, but it sounds like she was involved in the payments as that's most often the case with people who work while in school. So if nothing else, there's that to drive her to work for more than housing, and the amenities most people would list for today's Western middle class (i.e. phone, internet, cable/subscriptions, possibly car, various insurances, possibly vacations, side entertainments like eating out/movies/etc.) Additionally, as she is self-employed, she may want to contribute to a retirement fund. Not sure if you all have or are planning to have kids, but perhaps she wants to save for them as well?\n\n\"No one asked her to.\" Ok. Have you two talked about the way you want to live? Many people don't like to live with a great deal of unpaid debt gaining interest over their head and many like to have as much space as they can comfortably afford to live their everyday lives. So while you may not have asked her to do so, to live at a level she wants to live at (debts that have regular payments made and an end in sight, creature comforts in terms of type of housing and comfortable accessories), she may well need to work as she does, even if no one (i.e. you) didn't ask her to. If you very strongly feel like she is working unnecessarily on your behalf, you should discuss all the things you'd like to cut out of your current lifestyle so that she can work less. However, though I hope you already know that this is obvious, she may prefer to work more so she/you can have an do things that you wouldn't be able to afford otherwise.

That perhaps they give her a sense of satisfaction and purpose entirely separate from the monetary satisfaction? Have you considered that or talked to her about that? If she hates her Etsy shop and has secretly wanted to close it up, but has only been grinding so hard because she wants to help you out of your debt, cool, then maybe she will happily hear that you want her to work less and you all can rework the finances so that she sells less and you both live with less and your credit score stagnates instead of improving.

It\u2019s unfortunate people like that are the way they are. 0 accountability for any action. Always tries to justify things they\u2019re done. Because some how in their minds they just can\u2019t be wrong or the bad person. Even though they manipulate you into whatever it is they want from you or out of you. I also have an ex sorta like that. She cheated on me, and after we broke up started going out with my \u201cbest friend\u201d, and a few other things. But somehow Theyll always find a way to justify whatever they did. Im sorry you had to experience someone so assholy.

Man is too old to be acting like a whiny, clingy hormonal teen. Or I will take that back. I've seen 16 year olds treat their gf better, so that would be an insult to teenagers.", "Yes was going to say that.", "Clearly he isn\u2019t the one doing them", "Err is anyone else just getting a TEMU ad when they follow that link?", "Absolutely \ud83d\udcaf", "Probably part of the money is already going to a lawyer", "Right? My longest job search was 2 MONTHS. I had money saved for a year of expenses but still considered taking a part time job at the end so I wouldn't burn through my savings as fast. \n\nI couldn't imagine mooching off another person for 3 years and then bitching about them...", "Maybe I just surround myself with decent people, but I\u2019ve literally never heard the term gold digger use to describe a woman unless her partner was massively wealthy. \n\nNobody is going to give you shit for not dating a jobless bum except for another jobless bum.", "I guess that depends on your definition of a lot. \n\nThe vast majority don't.", "And why would we care about the misguided opinions of idiots?", "Oh my goodness tell me about it.

A very common occurrence among couples with communication problems.\n\nWe have no idea how big or little of an issue him not working is to her. I dont know why it keeps being mentioned? Anything more would be an assumption without more info.\n\nIf her issue is money, and she thinks self publishing books and podcasting is the answer, then a.) She should do research to have realistic expectations on returns for time spent and investment required and b.) She should actually finish and publish the first book before skipping out on an evening with partner+friends to work on the 3rd.  I have a strong suspicion that she has lost money on everything outside of her main job, but we have no idea. We know the books have not made anything. How many hours away from her partner did she sacrifice to write those 2 books? How realistic is making money from the 2 books she's written? She doesn't seem present for the relationship. She seems like a workaholic. Which is a very common way breadwinners have avoided communication forever lol.\n\nI fear for younger people being sucked into believing too strongly in \"hustle culture\" not understanding most of the options are on the same level as being a Cutco knife salesman. You'll pay up front and be lucky to be seen by friends and family. Self publishing can also fairly exploitative in the same way. 0 risk for the publisher/knife company and all risk on the author/salesman.\n\n\nI just started posting here and get downvoted like crazy, so I think I'll go back to only reading OPs as conversation starters with my partner.", "But it's his new phone, undoubtedly purchased and maintained by his workaholic wife.", "Often I can guess, but he stumped me with\n\n>I didn\u2019t tell her I incod them", "But it\u2019s a new phone\u2026that his wife is paying for.", "And we know jobs may be hard to find, but there are plenty of jobs available if you need money and don't turn up your nose at them.

I remember trying to read a New York Times \"best seller\" that was terrible. I was talking to my husband and I said I could write a better one, joking of course, he said do it. I never thought about actually doing it. I always had stories in my head but that's where they stayed. We were driving at the time, an hour later when we got to our destination I had the outline in my head. Having that kind of support is undescribable and that's coming from someone who's always good with words."]}
