I spent pretty much all day there so I was pretty tired from hauling around my kid who sometimes refuses to sit in his stroller. It was very busy so I went to go look for somewhere to sit to get me and my son sorted to go home. I came across a resting area with alot of tables that were all taken but I happened to notice a man get up and leave right as I got there. So lucky! I thought. I did a quick scan to see if anyone was waiting for the table, admittedly a bit haphazardly as I didn\u2019t want to hesitate too long and lose the table.\n\nSo I sat down, parked my stroller and put my son down to take a quick breather and sort our things to go home. When I looked up, I saw a heavily pregnant lady a couple feet away giving me the stink eye. I was willing to give her my table so I said\n \u201cHi, did you want to sit down?\u201d\nShe scowled at me and said \u201cNo, you obviously needed it much more than me.\u201d very sarcastically.\nThis is where I start to put together that maybe she was waiting for the table but perhaps I didn\u2019t see her? I\u2019m not sure to be honest so I continued with \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem at all, I don\u2019t mind moving!\u201d as cheerfully as I could.\nShe rolled her eyes at me and said \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t want you to do that\u201d again very sarcastically.\nAt this point I\u2019m annoyed and just say \u201cokay\u201d and go about my business. I was only there for about 5 minutes to pack up my things and she stood there scowling at me until her husband came by. She muttered something to him and they both gave me the stink eye and left. \n\nI feel bad because I still could\u2019ve just got up and gave it to her, she looked like she needed it but I wasn\u2019t about to grovel about it.

You have every right to sit down and you offered which is very sweet. She was just having a bad day. *hugs*", "Nta, it sounds like she wanted you to get up without her having to agree that she wanted the seat which is annoying, neither of you were entitled to the spot, you offered it to her to be kind, she said no- therefore, she didn\u2019t get to sit down.", "She said it was fine multiple times, there's no conflict here, move on with your life", "NTA, you offered her the seat, the moment she declined it stopped being your problem.", "You made a generous offer to share, pregnant lady rejected it.

You offered to move and she said no with a sarcastic comment.  You offered to move again and she did the same.

It reminds me of a time my husband and I and my 3 yo son were at the mall and a rude man took a chair from our table without asking. Didn't need the chair, but showed what an ass he was.", "NTA.  She sounds like a miserable human being, poor kid doesn\u2019t know what they are in for\u2026", "Nta", "Normally I default to giving pregnant women extra courtesy and attention, but not this time because that woman was rude, sarcastic and passive aggressive.

I\u2019m hurt. Like I can bearly walk. And a pregnant person asked me to move so she could sit. I said no.  She threw a fit. I ignored her because she was rude.  After a while someone else said why won\u2019t you move for her.  I looked at them and said. Are you my doctor? Or my friend?  Do you need my medical information?  No is a complete sentence.\n\nOther ppl offered her their seat she told them no.  Once I finally moved she realized I couldn\u2019t move my leg at all.  Everyone else was like :0  like I no one owes anyone a seat unless you want to.  If she would have asked me nicely I would have explained nicely but she was rude and entitled.  I\u2019ve also been pregnant. Sickly pregnant. But I never was rude about needing to sit.", "NTA. She didnt need to be so rude about it. Im sure there was a spare chair at your table that you wouldve been happy to let her have, and instead of asking to use it, she decided to be rude. Thats her problem.", "NTA - I am so bloody tired of pregnant woman thinking the world revolves around them just because they decided to have a baby", "Fuck that gal , NTA", "NTA. Pregnant women need to understand that their condition is not an excuse to manipulate people into giving them whatever they want.", "NTA\n\nYou offered her the table cheerfully, she declined.  Her passive aggressive games didn't work for her, today, so she was browned off about that, to boot.", "As far as I'm concerned, pregnant women and people lugging babies/small kids and strollers are on equal footing in terms of seating priority.

Her sarcasm was more important than sitting.  It\u2019s all on her.", "NTA\n\nPlease explain \"stold\" a seat from this woman when it applies to first come first served. That right there is toddler mentality in that \"if i see it it's mine\". You didn't steal anything, you simply got to the seat first and then not once but twice offered it to that snotty pregnant woman. I would have offered once then ignored her.", "NTA.\n\nmisery loves company. she didn\u2019t want the seat, she wanted the drama.", "NTA-!!! Worst case scenario she was perhaps waiting and you didn't notice, meaning you accidentally cut her. Maybe she hadn't been waiting any longer than you. You went ahead and offered to give her the seat even though you were in no way obligated to. She could've thanked you for your generosity and take you up on your offer. Instead she chose negativity and pettiness. She was in no way entitled to that seat. She chose to make a big stink about it, that's on her. Had I been in NY your place I may have found an excuse to sit there as long as possible or no looked around for someone equally \"deserving\" of the seat and offered it to them Infront of her. They say \"karma is a dish best served cold\" I know that doesn't really apply here but I like to remind myself that I've always been one helluva good waitress and sometimes karama needs a helping hand. She wanted to make a point out of something that may or may not have even happened.

He was 5 pounds inside of me \n\n Now it's like carrying around hyperactive deadweight that doesn't want to be anywhere else than.

You literally were giving up the seat. She wanted to be angry.\n\nSome people are so hell bent on being angry that they don't see that accidents happen", "Huh? You offered. You're not responsible for how others choose to feel about anything. Just like they're not responsible for your choices.", "NTA", "NAH you did the right thing by offering her the seat twice. She is overly hormonal and her body has been doing the equivalent work of running a marathon for months now.", "Because offering a seat wasn\u2019t enough after possibly missing her looking for one: she was looking for OP to grovel and beg forgiveness for daring to mildly inconvenience her \ud83d\ude01\n\nNTA", "Nta - you offered she was spiteful and left. Her problem.", "Neither of you are the AH here, it\u2019s sucks\u2026 it\u2019s hard when you have a small child being awkward on you but it\u2019s also hard being pregnant and you just happened to both be there, honest sounds like you should have made your 1 1/2 year old get in his stroller (which yes is hard but can be done, I have done it multiple times) and she should have accepted the seat you offered if she needed it\u2026 just a sucky situation that the closer we get to Christmas is going to happen more often", "NTA. she thinks being pregnant is hard, lugging around a 1 1/2 year old is EXHAUSTING. you need every second you can get and even still you offered up your seat. TWICE. and she turned it down. her loss is your gain, hun", "NTA.  What you were doing was equally as exhausting, although hopefully not as bad on the back.  Sorting things properly with a rambunctious child is not simple or quick.  You offered to let her have the table.  She said no.  End of story.", "NTA  she decided to be one instead of take a seat.  She obvi didn't really need or or she would have taken you up on it!", "NTA; her entitlement says it all. With that being said I do have a disability but I normally have my rollator with me so I don't have an issue with sitting. Still I'm petty so I'd never give up a seat unless I didn't need it.", "NTA. The woman was an asshole, ungracious and leveraging her condition to  try and instill guilt in you.  A very pregnant hustler.", "I have chronic vertigo, sometimes when shopping I jus5 have to sit for a few minutes otherwise I\u2019ll fall over.
