Move out! Move wherever you want. Your mom has been an adult longer than you have and will be fine living on her own.", "NTA. You say Mom did a great job. Well, her job is over; you're an adult and if you want to go, go. Emotional blackmail is not the sign of good parenting.", "NTA. You're an adult and get to live your own life.", "This is going to ruffle some feathers: as someone who comes from a culture where living your elderly parents is normalized, I'm quite sympathetic to your mom's situation. That said, you need to weigh that against your own desire for independence. You mentioned that she can't afford to live on her own. I recommend helping her figure out the logistics of how to do that. While some may argue it is not your responsibility to do so, I think you have to decide for yourself the right balance of supporting her and focusing on your own life path. I strongly believe it is possible for you to live independently while also demonstrating to your mom that you love her and are there for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
