Move out! Move wherever you want. Your mom has been an adult longer than you have and will be fine living on her own.", "NTA. You say Mom did a great job. Well, her job is over; you're an adult and if you want to go, go. Emotional blackmail is not the sign of good parenting.", "NTA. You're an adult and get to live your own life.", "This is going to ruffle some feathers: as someone who comes from a culture where living your elderly parents is normalized, I'm quite sympathetic to your mom's situation. That said, you need to weigh that against your own desire for independence. You mentioned that she can't afford to live on her own. I recommend helping her figure out the logistics of how to do that. While some may argue it is not your responsibility to do so, I think you have to decide for yourself the right balance of supporting her and focusing on your own life path. I strongly believe it is possible for you to live independently while also demonstrating to your mom that you love her and are there for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She will call you a \"bad daughter\" and more to keep this situation going. \n\nThis is what she wants for her... she doesn't care about what you want for you. \n\nGood luck with whatever you decide for yourself... it may be easier to just do it her way. She will die... one day... can you wait until then?", "she\u2019s 62, her life could be another 20 or 30 years. \n\nNTA \u2014 go be independent!", "Judging by your previous posts about her, it seems like your mother is dependent on you and is maybe emotionally blackmailing you (even if unintentional). \n\nNTA for wanting your independence but know that it will probably cause a bit of fall out. If you\u2019re from a culture where taking care of your parents in older age is normalised/expected just make sure you have the right support system should you choose to live alone.", "No, you\u2019re not the asshole for wanting to live alone and frankly, if you don\u2019t do that, what is your life going to be like when she does leave? Good parents want their children to grow and develop their own lives so that once the parents are dead, the kids can still have a life. so I know you say you have zero issues with your mom, but the fact that she doesn\u2019t want you to have your own life is a pretty big issue.", "What are you exactly expecting to happen here?\n\nYoure not an asshole for wanting to be independent and all that, but you dont have a solution for when you do it, your mom doesnt seem to have any alternatives to living with you, do you just wanna throw her out on the street or something?\n\nYoure not financially responsible for your mother, but the world is what it is, and if you dont help her she will have her life turn to shit without a plan, maybe delay your plan on being independent until your mom can get a job or you can help her find somewhere affordable to live", "I feel for you, but YTA. You said that your mom did an excellent job raising you. And that she also can\u2019t afford to pay for all her expenses. So basically what you\u2019re saying is that you want to let your mother be homeless? Kicked out on the street? And she has heart issues too?? Not gonna lie, that sounds rather heartless. \n\nI get wanting that independence. But you\u2019re gonna need to balance that with caring for your mother. Unless you don\u2019t care about her at all and have no problem letting her struggle on her own. \n\nAnd to the commenters saying this is emotional manipulation, it\u2019s not. This is just the mother pointing out her very very real concerns. \n\nI\u2019m close to your age, so I assume your parents would be similar in age to mine. All it takes is one fall, or one heart attack without anyone around in the house, for things to take a turn for the worse. One of my aunts had a stroke at home, and another fell in the bathroom. If they lived alone, they probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten to the hospital in time. As it is, my culture emphasizes a lot on at least one adult kid living with their parents especially once they hit retirement age. And there is a huge reason for that.", "NTA.  Your mom has put herself in the position of relying on you financially.  If you leave, she can't afford to live alone.  You'll probably need to strategize on ways to find her a roommate or relative to stay with.  You'll also want to make sure you're able to live on your own financially as well.  If you move out or anything did happen to your mom, that's 40% of your rent you'll need to be able to cover.", "If your amazing mother who gave you a great life and now has heart trouble winds up with no place to live so you can experience independence, then yes, YTA. If you and she can figure out a place for her to live independently, then no, you aren't.", "Take into account that your mom has heart problems and her reaction in part comes from fear. Fear from being able to financially support herself and fear of being alone and having a heart attack or stroke. People who are scared sometimes go on the attack. It sounds like she has been an amazing mom to you so this sounds out of character. She could just be scared.   \nThe \"I won't be here much longer also speaks of fear, not necessarily reality. Also sounds like she has made you her world.. is there anyone else but you in her life that she can turn to?  \n\n\nWhat are your options here, is there someone she can move in with, can you get a place with separate living so you are both independent but close? I don't think you are an AH for wanting to be independent. That is a problem but you don't seem to have any solutions. If you up and  left without a solution then yeah YWBTA.", "NTA. It sounds like she might qualify for low income housing and should check thst out.", "Nta as a single parent myself i would never do this to my kids to be honest I can\u2019t wait for my boys to move out I will be anxious and stressed that there out on the the world by themselves and the can always come home if needed but I\u2019m also looking forward to peace and quiet and much cheaper bills and having a house to myself I am a bit of a loner lol your mother is emotionally blackmailing you", "NTA but realistically what do you expect your mother to do? It sounds like she is both sick and can't afford to live independently. Where do you expect her to live?\n\nI have a pretty good mother, not perfect, but pretty damn good. I certainly don't want to live with her as an adult but if she was otherwise going to be in substandard living conditions I would open my home to her in a heartbeat and live with her for the remainder of her life.\n\nI'm just curious how if your mother was as great as you say you would be able to put her out when you say she cannot afford to live independently. Your NTA for what you want but I'm just not sure how you could do that to a person you claim can't support themself.", "NTA - it\u2019s time your mum learnt to live on her own as well, I have Suggested to my children that it\u2019s good to live on your own, learn to be self sufficient etc.  I think your mum needs to put on her big girl pants and start living her life and let you live yours, just because you live somewhere else doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t see each other. Move out and start living for you.  Being a mum myself and I have been a single mum I get How hard it can be to let go it\u2019s hard to think you will be alone, but she needs to make her own friends, look into doing something even if it\u2019s volunteering etc\n\n&#x200B;\n\ngood luck hope you can convince her and ask her to stop with the emotional blackmail because that\u2019s what it is.  She is a couple of years younger than me and I plan to be around for a while", "NTA\n\n  \nYOur mom is an AH, escape so you can have a life of your own.", "NTA but is there a retirement community she could move to that you can contribute to, so that she won't be alone and lonely, and you get to live alone.   \nI mean you have no obligation to do this but it might be a nice way to make sure you get what you want which is living alone, and she gets to live somewhere with company and amenities to older folks (she not even old but you know what I mean)", "INFO: Can we assume you are in a Western Culture when it is normal for adult children to live independently?\n\nYour mother raised you and you two are best friends.  Younger caused problems. you have no childhood trauma.  \n\nYour mother can not afford to live alone.   I think she understands that and is guilting you.  She would like to sustain the level of living the two of you share.  \n\nI have no idea how good your genetics are.  Your mother could live for another 10 yrs.   Then you would be sacrificing your own adult hood to care for her.\n\nNTA  but you and your mother need to have the tough discussion of how she can support herself if / when you move out.", "There are other solutions out there beside OP having her mom live with her forever.  Mom can get a roommate, for example.  Mom could move to a LCOL locale where she has friends or family.  Mom could look into subsidized housing.  If she\u2019s in good health, 62 is NOT that old."]}
