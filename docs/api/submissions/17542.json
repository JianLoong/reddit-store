I set up the savings account, and every month, my boyfriend and I have been adding little by little into it to afford things like nursery furniture, clothes, diapers etc.\n\n\nIm now 23 weeks pregnant with our baby girl. about a month ago however, my car was rear ended while i was driving. the car was totalled and my insurance company said they would pay me out the full value of the car plus compensation. they agreed to pay the \u00a35000 i purchased it for with another \u00a32000 for injuries etc. Last night i received this payment, and my boyfriend started talking about what he was going to do with \u201chis half of the money\u201d. \n\ni said pretty much all of that money will be going towards our daughter. he argued that since he bought half of the car, he should receive half of the payment. i said he didn\u2019t buy half of the car as half of his payment was a gift and i paid him the majority of what i owed back until he wrote the loan off on the condition it went towards our baby. therefore that\u2019s where this payment should go.\n\nhe said we should split the money 3 ways, as this would be the fairest option. a third to him, a third towards the baby and then a third for myself. \n\ni still argued no as we will need the money for the baby. he told me he\u2019s sick of saving money constantly and he deserves some cash to spend on things he wants since it\u2019s been almost 5 months since he has been able to do so. i said that\u2019s part of being an adult and having children.\n\nhe\u2019s still arguing im an asshole because he bought half of my car, but i don\u2019t think i\u2019m being an asshole here.", "created_utc": 1684396209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ks0e4/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_doesnt_own_half/", "score": 1170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like this situation comes up here often. One person comes into money and the partner tries to convince them that all or part of it should be theirs.

Like you said, he gifted you some money, you paid some back and then he wrote the rest of the loan off. He has no claim in your insurance payout.

You're having a child *with* a child. Being a parent obviously means budgeting and saving. That money isn't his (because a gift + a loan =/= ownership) and even if he was entitled to a portion of it, the smart thing to do would be to save it. He needs to grow up.", "NTA (and anyone saying No asshole here or everyone is an ah are IDIOTS) \n\n1. This brings up a MASSIVE problem, I understand the frustration of not having much playground money but - you guys are having a kid together, does he REALISTICALLY not understand how much this will cost? how the baby will get MORE expensive when they are born?  I think you both need to sit down and have a realistic conversation about finances and the baby, as well as your financial life going forward, whats your rent like? how is it split? whats your discussions for future emergencies? for future large purchases? etc. this is a MAJOR conversation to be had in any serious-long term relationship. \n2. in no way is \"half\" fair. outta the 7k, 2k is for your injuries, he's not entitled to that, He only gave 2k  out of the 5k, 1k was a gift, $500 was paid, and $500 was agreed to be put into the childs fund.  you \"owe\" him NOTHING. he is being obnoxious. \n3.", "After reading a lot of these comments. I am so grateful for my wife. If, after eight years of marriage, I had to calculate who owed who for their generosity, I'd be screwed. NTA, OP. If you want to do something for your bf, then do it.

He provided $2k of $5k. That's 2/5 ... but 1/5 was a gift, so the other $1k was the loan amount, of which you repaid half, leaving $500.\n\nIf you had obtained a bank loan for the purchase of that car and it was totaled with only $500 outstanding, the bank wouldn't be entitled to half of your $5k property settlement because you had owed that much at the time of purchase. They would get only the portion of the settlement needed to fulfill the terms of the loan and you would get the remainder.\n\nAt some point during the repayment process, you became pregnant with your boyfriend's child. He chose to forgive the remainder of the loan with the proviso that you would pay that amount into a fund for baby needs.\n\nAssuming you have already done that, every penny of the settlement is yours.\n\nIf you have not, use part of the settlement to fulfill that agreement. Once you have, the remainder is yours to apply toward your medical expenses and a replacement vehicle.\n\nThe most he could expect you to pay to him from your settlement would be that outstanding $500 (and any interest, if that was part of your agreement).\n\nThe man said that you should put the remainder of your loan repayment(s) into the baby fund and that is exactly what I would do.\n\nYou didn't marry the man (or at least not yet).

He gave you 2k. Gifted you 1k. You paid back 500. If you want to give him money, pay back the remaining 500. A gift is a gift. Does he want everything else he gave you back?", "NTA. That money needs to be spent on repairing your vehicle to a safe standard. If you choose to give some to you partner that would be nice, but it's not required and you would not be the asshole for keeping it all for the baby. \nFrankly ALARMING that your partner is sick if saving after 5 months. He realises household expenses will go up when the baby is actually here right?", "NTA Your bf is being selfish and not thinking about his child. And you need to put that money towards another car. You'll need it with a baby.", "He lent you the money, and later said the rest of what he was owed could be put in the kids fund.\n\nThat's lending; as opposed to paying part of the price and receiving some ownership of the car in question.\n\nHow does someone get those two confused?\n\nNTA", "NTA. He gifted $1k, leant $500 and wrote off $500. Personally, I'd have offered to honour the last $500 since the circumstances have changed. Regardless, he's high if he thinks he's entitled to half or even a third considering $2k of that payout was for injuries he did not sustain. \n\nKids are expensive. It makes the most sense for you as a team to use that money for the baby and on the repairs needed for the car. He'll still benefit in the long run by saving on baby related items.", "NTA and he sounds like he's not ready to be a father. Yes, even parents need selftime and care, including getting something nice from time to time but he went the worst way possible about it. Just be honest about it and talk it through.", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to get his head out of his ass. First of all, yes it should be going to your daughter.\n\nSecond of all, make it obvious how wrong it is.\nDraw up the math that went on, how his savings shrunk and grew, how his and your money paid for the car etc.\nMake it clear, on paper, that he isn't entitled to extra cash.\n\nIn case you feel very generous, i'd suggest you deal out 500 to him and 500 to yourself so you can all splurge on something small. The baby will be coming soon and then things will be infinitely more stressful and difficult. Maybe a small gesture could be good for both of you. Get yourself a nice massage or something.", "NAH\n\n  \nIt's understandable that your boyfriend may feel entitled to a portion of the money since he contributed to the initial purchase of the car. However, it's also important to prioritize the needs of your baby and ensure that the funds are used efficiently for the family. \n\n  \nInstead of insisting on a specific division of the money, try to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your financial priorities and how the money can best be used to benefit your family as a whole.

After all, everything else that was spent on the car was technically for your personal benefit (your car), and half of the money he expected back for his own personal use went to baby things. It was by his own suggestion of course, but in the long run maybe it just started to feel a bit unfair. \n\nHowever, I don't think this is your biggest issue. His attitude about all this is definitely a bit concerning, first of all with trying to claim half of the car even though he gave you a gift, and you only owed him a smaller amount still. Plus, he will need to make a whole lot more sacrifices than a couple of thousand pounds when *having a baby*. It sounds like he might not be entirely prepared for that reality.

Every dollar should be accounted for so you know where it\u2019s going and where you stand financially. When I first got married, my husband and I built a budget we thought was reasonable but didn\u2019t account for fun money because we were trying to pay off our student loans as fast as possible. It was miserable. We were so resentful of each other and just outright angry when one or the other of us would say hey I want to do or buy XYZ, because didn\u2019t the other person know we were trying to pay off debt?!?! So now we have fun money. We are allowed $100 each and we can spend it however we want without having to consult the other person, but once it is gone for that month, it\u2019s gone. If I don\u2019t want to cook dinner and want to go buy food, if it\u2019s not accounted for in our \u201cgoing out to eat\u201d budget, and I don\u2019t have it in my fun money, guess we are having sandwiches lol. If my husband wants a new game, but he doesn\u2019t have enough to cover it, he waits until the next month to buy it.

Having a large amount in the savings account for the baby and not having to spend the time and energy stressing about how you\u2019re going to afford everything over the next few months/years is a gift to both of you.\n\nMaybe offer a compromise, the lump sum goes to the baby account and in return he can decrease his contribution to the savings by a certain amount per month over the next year.  He can still save up for the personal things he wants and you get the security of knowing that the money you need will be available.", "Give him $500. Tell him that was what you owed before he wrote it off. So there's no resentment. Then tell him you'll take him to court for child support because he's acting petty and immature.", "NTA. Sorry to say but he doesn't sound like solid foundation for bringing a baby home. Keep that money away from him. If it's all you have you WILL need it. No ifs ands or buts. I have an 8 month old. That shit is expensive lol", "Ew is all I can say when I read his response and reasoning. First off, if he wants to get technical he didn\u2019t even pay for half, he paid 40% and half of that was a gift and you had already paid $500 towards the other half as a loan. If you were just going to use it for fun money one could argue that you could give him $500 for the loan (even though he was the one to tell you not to worry about it, so even then you\u2019re being generous) but the fact that he\u2019d rather spend it on himself instead of the baby like you intended is disgusting. If he\u2019s already tired of saving for a kid he\u2019s in for a rude awakening.", "ESH honestly, as I assume you didn\u2019t get him any $1,000 Christmas presents! Pay him back the money he loaned you", "I get you're freaking out about saving for the baby, but people cannot sacrifice everything in perpetuity. Try, and something will snap.

That....is not going to happen. \n\nUse the money buy yourself a new car and pay your medical bills. Because that's what the money is actually for.\n\nAnything leftover? Go on one nice day out date and save the rest.

And to his finaly argument...the only suspect amount he gave was 500 or 10% of your car...and even that techically was a gift.", "At first the title made me think y t a for sure but WOW this guy doesn\u2019t seem to understand he\u2019s gonna be spending a lot more than just this money on his own daughter. NTA, really think about whether this is the guy you want to raise your kid with", "This story is so weird. It's like you have two different boyfrienda: one very generous and the other miserly AF. I can't seem to unify them in my mind into one guy. Definitely going with NTA, but this is confusing as hell.", "NTA probably. It doesn\u2019t depend on how many other things he\u2019s been paying for and how many luxuries you\u2019ve been enjoying. Like is he covering all the other costs plus your car? Or is everything evenly split?", "OP idk if this about the car or just some crazy male pregnancy brain, maybe you\u2019re seeing his true colors. The fact that he cannot put the baby first is a big red flag.", "Me personally I would give him $500 and anytime he brought it up again I'd tell him to get bent.

He's in for a rude awakening with his fun money and expenses with a baby inbound. NTA.", "NTA", "What happened here?  Back in November he had a selfless attitude, now that you\u2019re pregnant he\u2019s looking out for himself?  NTA, but my god something is wrong with this man.

You repaid half of that before he discharged the rest of your debt. The cash he gifted you isn't relevant to the situation because it was a GIFT and it belongs to you.  If he wants to be an ass, give him \u00a3500 to officially pay off the rest of the loan (that he said you didn't have to pay him).

If the situation was reversed I doubt he would be generous", "Umm,  no.  He paid for 2/5 of the car, not half.  \n\nAlso, 1/5 of that was a gift.  So between a outright gift and your money that was 4/5 of the car.  \n\n1/5 was a loan which you paid back since he wanted $500 to be put into another account.  \n\nAnd even if it was a loan you'd owe him, at best $1000.  It wasn't a stock purchase it was an interest free loan.\n\nNTA.  But the idea of having 2 kids with that choade.", ">pretty much all of that money will be going towards our daughter. heargued that since he bought half of the car, he should receive half ofthe payment\n\nHis case to any ownership of the vehicle is shaky. As is his math considering even 2000/5000 is not half, and when you take out the money you paid him back and what was a gift, he's at most in for 500/5000, a measly 10%. Even if he was owed part of the payout, why are you the only responsible adult in the relationship who will use the money to care for your shared child? Personally, I'd put all of it in the baby fund, save maybe enough to go out to a nice dinner or something.\n\nFun fact for him - the child, unlike the car, IS half his NTA", "NTA. Priorities first.
