However due to recent events no longer want to let him have the car. Please bear in mind that I have paid for the car and the parts.\n\nRecently I went on vacation and left my nephew with a key to my garage so that he could work on the car while I was away (this proved to be a bad decision).\nI told my nephew that he was free to go round the garage when he wanted while I was away. \n\nWell one night while away he decided to take my 1968 nova that I had recently restored costing upwards of $50000 and thousands of man hours out of the garage and for a joyride around my private land.This ended in disaster as he went to fast and crashed into a ditch and rolled it causing a lot of damage to the point that the car is now likely scrap.\nMy nephew is fine by the way.\n\nI didn't discover that anything was wrong till I came back from my vacation and opened the garage to get one of my cars out and noticed my wrecked nova sitting there. As he was the only one with a key I knew it was him. I tried to call him but he would not answer his phone. Neither would his dad(my brother) so I went over to his house.\n\nWhen I got to his house he answered the door and immediately said that my nephew was really sorry for what happened and that he was only being a stupid kid. I told him that I was keeping the Mustang unless he paid for my car that he ruined and left.\n\nOnce I got home I received multiple calls and messages from my brother and his wife saying that I was being unreasonable and that it's not fair to keep his car and that he won't have anything to drive when he gets his license in a few days and that he was only being a stupid kid. My nephew has still not directed apologized to me he has just passed an apology through his dad. \n\nI'm still furious and I still think I am going to keep the car or sell it to go towards fixing or replacing the nova.\n\nI also should mention that the nova has a large amount of sentimental value as it was my father's and we were restoring together till he passed away. Everyone in the family knows this but I am starting to wonder if this is clouding my judgement.\n\n\n\nJust to answer a few questions\n\nI know it was definitely my nephew as I have checked my security cameras \n\nMy nephew and my brother towed the car back to my garage with my brother's truck. It wasn't very far away probably only a mile max.\n\nUnfortunately the car wasn't insured as I only finished it a few days before going on vacation\n\nI have considered taking them to court but even if I was successful they don't have enough money or assets to pay.\n\nI have considered reporting it to the police but I am on the fence as I don't want to ruin my nephew's future with a criminal record but I do think that he needs to face the consequences of his actions\n\nTo be honest the value of the nova may not be $50000 but that is what has been spent on it\n\nThe locks have been changed so he can't get in the garage anymore", "created_utc": 1686237718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144c54u/aita_for_not_letting_my_nephew_have_the_car_we/", "score": 3011, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He steals a 50K car, drives it without a license, cracks it up, hides in his room and has his dad apologize for him, the family won't pay it back, and they want to brush it off as a stupid kid mistake?  It's pretty clear you're not going to get anywhere trying to talk sense into your brother as they clearly don't hold him to any consequences, and don't value your stuff.  What lesson are they teaching him here? Felonies are okay if they're committed against family?  Keep the Mustang, file a police report so you can get insurance to cover it or sue them for it if that's an option and they have the money.  Obvious NTA.", "Is no one worried about giving this \"stupid kid\" another vehicle to wreck? Maybe this time he will take out a family or himself. No, he clearly needs more practice driving. Also, it's bold of them to assume he's even going to pass his driver's test. NTA. I wouldn't give him a free killing machine either.", "NTA Give your nephew, brother and SIL a choice. You either report him to the police for stealing and crashing your car and your insurance company can go after him for payment of damage and what not, as well as facing legal action for theft and criminal damage, as well as legal fees. \n\nIn the meantime change the locks on your house just in case he copied your key.\n\nYour nephews old enough to know that actions have consequences and that he knows that theft is wrong some candela with losing out on a car, because he stole and crashed yours.", "It's not his car. It's your car. You were proposing to give him a car, but he stole your car and wrecked it.

It is not a get out of jail free card.", "1. It's your car, paid for by you. His labour contribution can go towards repayment of the car he destroyed. \n\n2. He took your car without permission, drove and crashed it, and never let you know. And even now, he's yet to personally face you and take full responsibility for his mistake.\n\n3. His parents are also not taking responsibility for what their son did.\n\n4. He's proven that he can't be trusted with a car. So even if you can overlook all that he did, the roads are much safer without him there.\n\n\nNTA. Nephew and his parents are the a-holes in this story.\n\nEdit: He still doesn't have keys to your place, does he? Incase he and your brother decide to come get the car they think he's entitled to.\n\nEdit 2: Also, they are now flooding you with phone calls.

So now they call?", "NTA\n\nI am more pissed with your brother and his wife for also giving you the \"he's just a stupid kid\" excuse and making no mention of restitution.

He has proven himself irresponsible. \n\nChange the locks,send them a comprehensive invoice of parts used/your time for the crashed car.

They all need to learn actions have consequences.", "INFO: Why haven\u2019t you filed a police report yet?", "NTA, I admire your self restraint to not take him to court over it tbh.", "NTA, if it were me I\u2019d be far angrier than you seem to be in the post. Honestly sounds to me like you\u2019ve kept your cool reasonably well. \n\nYour nephew not even having the guts to look at you and apologize is what gets me, what is hiding even going to do?", "NTA.\n\nWhat he did was not a \"stupid kid mistake.\" It was felony grand theft and vandalism.\n\nYou absolutely should file a police report and an insurance claim and then sue your brother for any loss in value that your insurance doesn't cover.", "Your judgement is fine - the kid doesn't respect your belongings: why on earth should you want to give him anything you value? His father can buy him a car when he's 16, or he can damn well walk. \n\nNTA, and get your damn keys back.", "NTA. The kid wrecked your car, and expects that you'll give him another? And his parents went along with this? The entitlement is staggering, and the kid is lucky he's just losing a car and not going to jail for theft and destruction of property.", "NTA\n\nHoly No Brainer Batman.  Am I missing something?  You are gifting a car to your nephew that you purchased and he is helping to restore. Yes, you promised that to him so normally thats a done deal.  BUT ...... no where in the equation is the kid wrecking a different car from your garage.  \n\nNOPE not clouding your judgement.  You are soooo in the right here.  \n\nSPOILER ALERT - when you are done with the mustang and sell it, your nephew, brother and SIL are going to contact you asking for the money from the sale.", "NTA. Your nephew and his parents are pieces of garbage. I would demand payback not give him the car and press charges!", "NTA. Tell your brother that you will send him a bill of the repair cost for the nova and i and when he has paid it in full and the car is restored you might give the other to your nephew.", "NTA, hell no, even if he does cough up an apology at some point, that ship has sailed. Never ever give him that or any other car! \n\nHe didn\u2019t just wreck something highly valuable - both monetary and emotionally - but did so after taking it without being allowed and then, worst of all, did not even come clean or even show remorse. And your brother is condoning this behavior because he obviously raised his son to behave like that. \n\nBtw, you\u2019re not keeping *his* car, you\u2019re keeping *your* car that you meant to gift to him when you didn\u2019t know what a massive, irresponsible AH he was. The nerve and the entitlement of that family are amazing. They should thank you for not going after them for damages, not trying to get an expensive gift from you for their behavior.", "NTA...your brother should have been there to meet you and explain everything upon your return, not let you find it like that.  He should have also offered to pay for the damage.", "NTA your brother and his wife obviously knew what your nephew did, I find all of their reactions bizarre. Did they even attempt to punish the nephew? And this is far more than a stupid kid thing, he stole and destroyed your car, then just put it back? All 3 of them sound like idiots, keep the mustang or better yet, finish it and sell to finance fixing the Nova", "NTA\n\nThe fact that your nephew has never apologised to you directly.  Your nephew was never taught to take responsibility for his actions, or he never listened to his parents. \n\nThe parents are even worse than the nephew for trying to make this into not a big deal. \n\nI would call the police. Full Stop.  He needs to learn a life lesson on how to take responsibility for his actions.  Not giving him the mustang is quite generous of you and is a quite reasonable  and generous of you, when you could be calling the police.\n\nI have to agree he is a stupid kid in every sense of the word.  He literally bit the hand that feeds him.  You were offering him a mustang and this is how he repays you.", "NTA - When $50k is involved, it's not about stupidity, it's about responsibility.  Yeah, he's a stupid kid, but who's responsible for him?  Your Brother is backtracking sooooo hard because he knows that all you have to do is make 1 phone call and he's out $50k.  Since neither one of them is stepping up and claiming responsibility nor are they offering any form of solution, you're left to solve this on your own and they don't get to say a damn word about it.", "NTA sue their asses and press criminal charges if they don't back off", "NTA. I would not give this kid a car, he doesn't sound like he belongs behind the wheel at all. Though a foxbody mustang won't go anywhere near the value of a 68 nova, I would bill your brother (since nephew is just a stupid kid) for the repair/replacement value of the Nova.", "NTA.  Your nephew stole and wrecked the Nova.  You bought and paid for the Mustang and parts.  It's \\*your\\* car, and your nephew has forfeited any good will he had coming.  It's a hard life lesson, but you would be making a huge mistake giving him the Mustang.", "NTA- Don't you dare let him drive that mustang until you are made whole on the car he wrecked. This is such a no-brainer and I'm sorry you even have to ask the question. People around you can have a way of making you think you are TA when clearly you are not. Don't give in to it.", "NTA   Your nephew owes you an apology and money. You owe him nothing.", "Nta. Why are you not insisting that they pay to replace the damaged car? I would also point out that you nephew could be charged with stealing your car.", "NTA.  He stole and totaled a classic car.  He gets a free pass because he's family?  I'm restoring a Karmann Ghia, if my nephew stole it I'd murder him!\n\nFile a police report so you can at least get the insurance.", "NTA- You should have showed up to their door with the police!\n\nFile a police report to at least get your brother to help you fix the nova.\n\nTotally ridiculous your brother still expects you to give your thieving nephew a car after this.\n\nYour brother refusing to let his son face any consequences for his behavior is a big tell tell sign as to why your nephew thought he had a right to touch your car in the first place.\n\nIs this your older brother ?\n\nDon\u2019t give him a dam thing except a bill for the damage .", "Well, when you tell them they can pay or be sued for the damages their son caused, be sure to tell them not to be angry about it because he's a young stupid kid. That should make them feel better about it.\n\nNTA", "Give him the keys to the Nova.  \"There's your car buddy, good luck.\". NTA\n\nEDIT: I can't believe his parents aren't delaying him getting his license as punishment over this, both due to him stealing the car and driving with so little regard for himself or the vehicle.  They'll probably get their asses sued off in his next crash.  Hopefully he won't also die in it.", "NTA and you should press charges.", "NTA. Your brother is a softie and is making him a bad parent. This is evident because your nephew doesn't feel the need to apologize to you himself. So it seems your brother and his spouse constantly cover for your nephew and your nephew hasn't always experienced the consequences of his own actions.\n\nTime to teach your nephew a lesson: When you fuck around, you have to find out. What kind of lesson is your nephew learning if he still gets rewarded for bad behavior? He's going to grow up into one of those douchebags that just takes and takes and takes without any empathy for whom he's taking from.\n\nHonestly, you should have a stern talk to your brother about teaching his child a lesson so that he doesn't grow up an entitled little fuckhead.", "Oh god I\u2019m so sorry. I have a 66 mustang fastback I restored with my dad. If someone wrecked that I\u2019d be devastated.\n\nEditing to say of course you\u2019re NTA and if it were me I would sell the restored mustang to try to fix the nova. Fix it if possible or at least salvage some parts for a new one so that you retain the sentimental connection", "That\u2019s fucking insane. The kid wouldn\u2019t even face you or talk to you and he still wants you to give him a valuable car? His lack of awareness, consequences, and responsibility here is off the charts and setting the stage for a major road tragedy. I work in road safety\u2026 It\u2019s sad the types of people who get licensed and, frankly, end up murdering other innocent road users. NTA. He should not even be licensed.", "NTA  \nYour brother certainly is. And so is his wife. Entitled AHs. And they're raising a cowardly, entitled Ah as a result.   \n\n\nDO NOT give your nephew a damn thing. Not even if he ever apologizes.", "This kid isn\u2019t ready to drive anything. \n\nNTA.\n\nWhen the kid can handle apologizing to you and working out a plan to work on restitution, that\u2019s when his parents should be supporting him in getting a license.", "NTA  The level of entitlement is off the charts from your nephew and his parents.  They hid the incident from you until you returned from vacation, and your weasel of a nephew can't even grow a pair and apologize? Time for your nephew to learn about consequences of shitty actions.", "NTA. \n\nPart of parenting is teaching \u201cstupid kids\u201d how not to become stupid adults. Like facing consequences for terrible choices. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your brother has any intention of doing so. You could even ask your brother how he thinks your nephew is going to learn anything from this experience based on your brother\u2019s handling of the situation. \n\nHonestly, I would take the nephew/bro to court for damages. And I most certainly would not let him have the new car. \n\nSorry for your loss. Sounds like that car had a lot of meaning to you.", "NTA. \u201cI told him that I was keeping the mustang unless he paid for my car\u201d. \n\nThat\u2019s a valid consequence for the actions of your nephew. The nephew committed a crime. Ask your brother if he would rather your nephew be charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle.", "NTA - a stupid kid mistake is forgetting to do your homework, not crashing someone else's very valuable, sentimentally important car.", "NTA, wow, I'm at a loss at the nerve of some people!  He's very lucky you're not suing him.", "big NTA, and to be honest, i'm surprised his parents are still so keen on him having a car as soon as he gets his license now. if that had been my ass, my dad would've told me i don't get that nice car until i can prove i can drive safely in something else.", "NTA, if he can't acknowledge what he did wrong, it's hard to imagine he learned his lesson enough to handle such a car.\n\n> Once I got home I received multiple calls and messages from my brother and his wife saying that I was being unreasonable and that it's not fair to keep his car and that he won't have anything to drive when he gets his license in a few days\n\nMost kids don't just get a free car and kids continue to live completely fine if they need somebody to drive them places. It's really not a concern at all that he won't have a car to drive. He can save up for it if he wants one. The only real argument that you may have done wrong would be that you went back on your promise to give him the car, but given that he \"took\" a car from you by destroying it and not paying to repair it, it's not crazy that you could keep this car in return.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are VERY generous not to make a police report for his car theft.", "Natural consequences say that if he wrecked your car, you keep the Mustang. It\u2019s totally fair. He is choosing to act like a child and hide behind your brother, who is enabling him. That\u2019s terrible parenting- ignore your brother and his wife. You don\u2019t owe this kid *another* car.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you were so taken advantage of and the amount of manipulation they\u2019re trying to do is outrageous. I don\u2019t think keeping the mustang is enough, he\u2019s clearly not mature enough to be on the roads. I would call the police. if it was MY child that did this to my sibling while they were out of town, the police would have already been notified, as would my sibling. What a horrible surprise to come home to.", "NTA\n\nHe STOLE your car and damaged it to the point it\u2019s scrap. (Also didn\u2019t bother to say a word and wouldn\u2019t answer his phone?)\n\nKeeping the car you were planning to give him is restitution, nothing more.\n\nYes, he was being a stupid kid - that doesn\u2019t mean that he gets to escape all consequences, or that you should bear all of the loss in this situation.\n\nIf you destroy someone\u2019s loved item (worth upwards of 50k) it is completely reasonable  to not want to gift them something worth tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nHe\u2019s lucky you\u2019re not filing a police report.", "NTA and I am mad on your behalf! Did they think you wouldn\u2019t notice if they just put it back in the garage? They wouldn\u2019t answer your calls and you had to go to them in person for answers. They should have told you, apologized profusely, punished their son, and offered to pay you back. I am so sorry that they wrecked the car that you worked on with your dad and has so much meaning to you. Your brother and his family are the AH.", "NTA. Holy shit, he stole your car and fucking destroyed it. And didn't have even the barest level of respect for you by telling you himself. Sounds like every other family member is saying shit for him instead of him owning his shit. So all of the family members giving you shit....can give him THEIR cars to drive if they have such an opinion about it. It's one thing to fuck up....it's a whole other thing to avoid any responsibility for the fuckup whatsoever  and still expect a GIFT as though it is OWED.", "NTA - I wouldn't trust him to not kill himself in the Mustang at this point.", "You are so NTA, irresponsible kid, who can't even apologize like he did nothing wrong. Stick to your guns, he pays or you sell the mustang to pay for the nova.", "NTA.\n\nAs far as your nephew not apologizing to you directly, I\u2019d place that blame more on his parents. He may be scared to talk to you directly, knowing how badly he fucked up, and they\u2019re enabling him instead making him talk to you, just like they\u2019re enabling him \u201cbeing a stupid kid.\u201d\n\nAt some point stupid kids need to learn that actions have consequences. And if his parents want to enable him so badly, then they can cover the cost of the car for him.", "Ummm are you going to press charges??? NTA", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences, and in this case it seems pretty fitting that the teenager who just destroyed someone else's vehicle will lose his own in payment. Why should you be left paying for someone else's mistake?\n\nThe fact that it means he will get his license and be stuck without a vehicle to drive? I don't see any issue here - he is facing exactly the same consequence as if (or given his attitude here, more likely when) he crashes the Mustang out on the road. So he can do exactly what he would be doing in that situation and figuring out a way to afford a replacement vehicle.\n\nIf his parents object and expect you to hand over the keys to the Mustang, I see a few main choices - They pay every single dollar of the repair bill to fix what was damaged and bring the Nova back to the condition it was when you left it, and your nephew puts in every hour of grunt work needed to get there. Alternatively, you could look towards your insurance to cover the losses, which no doubt would require filing a police report about the theft, and the insurance company coming after the guilty party to get their money back. The last option is what you have already noted, which is just keeping the Mustang in lieu of a cash payment or until one of the above is done.\n\nOne of the biggest failures here I see as being your nephew's attitude - instead of owning his mistake and trying to make up for it, he has hidden away and is hoping it will just go away if he ignores it. A truly terrible lesson for his parents to teach him, and one I can only see biting him back in the future...", "He's a stupid kid and they want to put a car in his hands??? How the hell do they think it's gonna turn out?\n\nHe destroyed a car and there should be no consequences? What the hell is wrong with them?\n\nNTA at all!", "NTA This was one of the more upsetting posts because some of us understand vintage cars. \n\nYour nephew needs to get a job and start paying you for the damages. It\u2019s criminal what he destroyed and is lucky to be alive. Safety features in the Nova doesn\u2019t compare to what we see now. \n\nHe isn\u2019t ready for the mustang. He needs a shitbox  to get started.", "NTA he destroyed a $50,000 car of huge sentimental value to you and hasn\u2019t even had the guts to apologise to you himself. Get that key back and never let him in that garage again. Actions have consequences and he clearly needs a strong lesson on that.", "NTA. Sorry about the nova.", "NTA AT ALL. They should count themselves lucky you\u2019re not going after them for damages to your other car. The cheek of them complaining about not getting a car now\u2026", "he is a stupid kid, that is 100% accurate.  \nHowever that is in no way excuse to wrech a car that must be 100k at least (50k repairs plus man hours, plus the original value):  \nThey should be pleading for you not to sue them, not asking for a car", "Nta\n\nFirstly I'd say he has proven himself too immature for driving, he could have been killed easily in this scenario. I certainly wouldn't have any part in enabling him to get behind the wheel again until he proves himself mature enough, on your land he only risked himself, whose kids will he be risking on the road?\n\nSecondly you put a lot of trust in him and he abused that trust at the first opportunity. An apology direct from him isn't even the minimum needed but it would have been a good first step. \n\nThirdly your brother is failing his child by trying to remove consequences. Kid needs to learn fast at his age and no consequences do the opposite.", "NTA.\n\nThis kid isn't mature enough for a car like that, apparently. And you don't owe him anything after he broke your trust. Your actions are completely justified. If his parents think he needs a car, they can buy him an old beater at a police auction or somehting. Sometimes kids that age need to reap what they sow to learn to be accountable for their actions.", "NTA. They raised a \u201cstupid\u201d kid, did they?  Wait until he smartens up before discussing another car with him.", "NTA,  I am appauled by your brother, sister in laws and nephew's attitude.  First he wrecked the NOVA which he had no business driving.  Next that Mustang is yours, until you decide to gift it to him.  He's paid nothing and gained valuable knowledge in the restoration of classic cars.  This family sounds extremely entitled and certainly see nothing wrong or even show remorse at what he did.  Honestly until you had him the papers, it is your car to do with as you see fit, which for me would not be something I would put in the hands of an irresponsible teenager.", "NTA. hot take, but \"stupid kids\" like that shouldn't have ANY car.", "NTA Op has the patience and self control of a saint! LIKE Damn I would have flipped a coin whether to call the cops or kick a door in...

I agree with everyone else sue go to the police, and file charges. \nInfo: how old is he.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. He is darn lucky you didn't bring in the cops and make him pay for the car he stole and destroyed. You also could have him charges.with.car theft.", "NTA. Spineless and hides when he is the one who created the issue? If he manned up and apologised, that would be a whole other matter.\nAnd his parents as well, what kind of examples are they showing him? It\u2019s okay to destroy other people\u2019s property and not apologise and have no remorse?", "NTA. You are doing something for your nephew that his own parents can\u2019t provide for him, a CAR. That you paid for and are being kind and giving him. You are absolutely right to stand your ground on this. You trusted him and he broke your trust and now is costing you more money by destroying another one of your cars. \n\nIf his parents are so concerned about what he\u2019s going to drive, they can go and buy him a car. \n\nYou helped him out, he screwed you over. Now him and his parents can kick rocks.", "NTA. Your nephew is old enough to drive, and he's old enough to suffer the consequences of his actions. \n\nI don't agree with others that you should have gotten police involved. That feels too harsh here. \n\nThe biggest AHs here are your brother and his wife. They have shielded him from any accountability. As you note, he has not even apologized to you directly! \n\nFor your nephew to suffer the loss of the promised vehicle is entirely suitable for what happened. \n\nGoing forward, you have a few options. \n\n* Keep the Mustang for yourself or sell it to repair the Nova\n* Hold onto it and give your nephew an opportunity to earn it back over time - maybe by helping you fix the Nova? Maybe through other labor? I'm thinking something that will take a year or so. \n\nThere's a teachable moment here for your nephew, and his parents are clearly not going to help him learn anything valuable. If you want to be the better adult in his life, you can try to find a way to do that. \n\nBut whatever direction you choose, you are not the AH in this situation.", "> it's not fair to keep his car and that he won't have anything to drive when he gets his license in a few days and that he was only being a stupid kid.\n\nMaybe stupid kids shouldn't be driving at all. He took your car without asking, drove it without a license, and crashed it. Maybe he should have to wait another 6 months before he is allowed to take the exam again. Maybe he needs remedial driving lessons. What he doesn't need is a free car from someone he deeply wronged.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAnyone who wants to complain that it's unfair that he wont have anything to drive can just give up their car to nephew.", "Wow!

However due to recent events no longer want to let him have the car. Please bear in mind that I have paid for the car and the parts.\n\nRecently I went on vacation and left my nephew with a key to my garage so that he could work on the car while I was away (this proved to be a bad decision).\nI told my nephew that he was free to go round the garage when he wanted while I was away. \n\nWell one night while away he decided to take my 1968 nova that I had recently restored costing upwards of $50000 and thousands of man hours out of the garage and for a joyride around my private land.This ended in disaster as he went to fast and crashed into a ditch and rolled it causing a lot of damage to the point that the car is now likely scrap.\nMy nephew is fine by the way.\n\nI didn't discover that anything was wrong till I came back from my vacation and opened the garage to get one of my cars out and noticed my wrecked nova sitting there. As he was the only one with a key I knew it was him. I tried to call him but he would not answer his phone. Neither would his dad(my brother) so I went over to his house.\n\nWhen I got to his house he answered the door and immediately said that my nephew was really sorry for what happened and that he was only being a stupid kid. I told him that I was keeping the Mustang unless he paid for my car that he ruined and left.\n\nOnce I got home I received multiple calls and messages from my brother and his wife saying that I was being unreasonable and that it's not fair to keep his car and that he won't have anything to drive when he gets his license in a few days and that he was only being a stupid kid. My nephew has still not directed apologized to me he has just passed an apology through his dad. \n\nI'm still furious and I still think I am going to keep the car or sell it to go towards fixing or replacing the nova.\n\nI also should mention that the nova has a large amount of sentimental value as it was my father's and we were restoring together till he passed away. Everyone in the family knows this but I am starting to wonder if this is clouding my judgement.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Honestly his father should be thanking the Lord that his kid is alright and walked away. This should be a wake up call for him that his kid is not nearly responsible enough for a car like this yet.

But there are ways he could have tried to make amends. The fact that he didn't, and hasn't, signals that he isn't ready to drive the car he has worked on with you. He needs to repair that relationship with you before the Mustang is even on the table.\n\nIn other words, the worth of the car may be clouding your judgment some, but I think your gut is correctly telling you that your nephew has handled this poorly.

As he got older I noticed that if I didn't say or do the right thing he wouldn't talk to me. Or wouldn't respond whenever I said something that was roo much for him to handle. Especially when it was about him being responsible for himself. He's almost 20 now and we barely talk. He avoids me if he owes me money on a loan or if he was supposed to do something I had asked him yo do. So to make a long story abnoxious, fuck that. The least your nephew could have done was take your call. I'm sure if he have just talked to you about it when it happened you would have been able to work it out t with him. But this uncle doormat thing is a bridge too far. NTA", "NTA. It wasn't a \"stupid kid mistake\". It was a decision your nephew made and it blew up on his face. The fact your brother and sister-in-law are more upset at the fact that you're keeping the car that you and your nephew were working on instead of offering to help out however they can to replace the car that he told old really says a lot. They don't care that he ruined your beloved Nova. They're only worried about the fact that he doesn't get a car that they don't have to pay for. Sell the car. Put it toward another one that you will be able to enjoy. And until your nephew apologizes himself since he is the one that caused all this, don't bother trying making amends. If he's old enough to take a car and completely total it, he is old enough to take responsibility for himself.", "While it\u2019s really cool and noble of you to restore a Fox body mustang with your nephew, that car is a recipe for disaster for a young man.

This is the way we learn what we can and can't do.\nSo, I am emphatic to your nephew. Probably, I would do something equally stupid if I were him.

The kid didn't even apologize. He just shat all over you. He thinks you are a stupid person to be taken advantage of. Cut them all out of your life. None of them care about you at all. And I can't even believe you didn't file charges!!!!!!!", "NTA. Tell your brother to buy a car for his own kid and pay you back for the one his kid destroyed.", "NTA. Another Gen Z kid who never has to take responsibility for their actions. Ugh! Tell your brother to rack off and be a better parent.", "YTA - you've driven a wedge between you and your nephew, and a car. Hope it was worth it.", "As far as punishments go, this is a pretty good one too. OP spent a lot of time fixing up the car which was all flushed away by the nephew. Sounds like nephew has spent a fair amount of time fixing the mustang. It\u2019s fitting to have him experience losing that time put into a car as well. And he totaled a car so loses a car. You\u2019re already out a car. Why is it on you to further go into the relative red by giving away another car. You trusted your nephew and he broke that trust. And he cant even tell you face to face. Maybe you two could come to a different arrangement but you cant if he always hides.", "Uncle... They're shielding him not just from the legal consequences of his actions but from ANY consequences of his actions. That's NOT a good lesson at this age and moving toward independence and adulthood.\n\nHow many young people who would have been wonderful, contributing members of society have been absolutely RUINED by not facing consequences until far too late. How many of us learned to be better people as adults by facing our own consequences and being required to give more than an apology to make it right when we were younger?\n\nHe could have faced you, recognized his stupidity, asked forgiveness, and had a chance to work it off and earn your trust back over time, cresting a stronger bond in the future.\n\nIt's not just a material item, either. It was a labor of love that meant a lot to you and memories of your father who is gone. I'm so sorry.\n\nSometimes, you have to let a kid fall on his hiney, so he learns to rise after falling and look in the mirror to face the person responsible for his own folly.  They don't want to risk bruising his ego or feeling bad, regardless of the cost to others. NTA and I'm sorry you're being mistreated by \"family.\"", "Exactly. That boy is not responsible enough for a car and his parents should see that. Stealing a car and driving it without a license? He shouldn't be allowed to get his license at this time. Needs to grow up before he can have those privileges let alone a mustang.", "I'd keep the mustang, but offer the kid to a restore a 1985 Ford Escort 4 banger, because clearly he is not ready for a car with any kind of horse power.", "Also, the only way to prevent a stupid kid from being a stupid adult is solid consequences when they fuck up.", "that's completely irrelevant since he's not asking to be financially compensated for it", "I can't believe he spent $50000 to restore this Nova when in 1968 it costs less than $4000 new. I know antique cars cost more to fix, but gracious.", "Sounds like a pretty wealthy family with multiple expensive cars and land you can joyride on, so not surprising the kid is entitled.", "As a general matter, a car owner is not legally responsible for the damages a car thief causes. There might be some very unusual circumstances to change that, and some staes may have chipped away at that principle. Of course, the owner is usually left holding the bag for the damage to his property, which is a reason for comprehensive coverage in insurance.", "Read a comment a *long* time ago, and also didn\u2019t verify so this could be a load of crap, but they said one of the reasons that kids 16-25 are involved in more fatal wrecks than others could be in part because they are often given cheap, old, beater vehicles that have far fewer safety standards than even mildly older vehicles. True or not, it has definitely helped clarify the first vehicles I want my sisters and kids to drive.", "Five years ago, a \u201cstupid kid\u201d was going 30 over, blew a stop sign, and killed my mom. He walked out without a scratch and without any jail time. The guy was 16 and had received two speeding tickets prior to that. \n\nThe court didn\u2019t want to ruin his life, but he sure as hell ruined my family\u2019s.", "I don't really care about cars. I still have absolutely no trouble understanding that someone who put thousands of dollars and hours into restoring anything would probably be pissed if someone stole and destroyed that thing. I would expect some interpersonal consequences there. And that's ignoring the sentimental value of having worked on it with your dad.", "Or someone else's more likely.", "It's not extortion when you demand compensation for damages.", "Aww. The good thing is that will give u time to find parts", "No it isn\u2019t. But when you threaten to call the police if they don\u2019t meet your demand for compensation, it is.", "For the farm kids? It was! My uncle had 2 old pickups he used to move equipment from field to field. My cousin and I raced them until I missed a turn at a T intersection. Guess who didn't make much that summer?", "I am curious, which state is this? I've not heard of anywhere in the US where that applies because you only need a license for driving on the road."]}
