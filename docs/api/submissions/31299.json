{"id": 31299, "submission_id": "17yup9p", "title": "AITA for not attending my friend\u2019s 30th birthday celebration and then ruining it?", "selftext": "Last Friday I (28F) was supposed to attend my friend Emma\u2019s 30th birthday dinner and party.\n\nIn the night leading up to Friday my BF (27M) was woken up  with asthma. In the morning he had a temperature but was otherwise relatively ok so we took it as nothing too serious. As he wasn\u2019t fit to go to Emma\u2019s celebration I texted her that only I would come.\n\nAt work I texted BF a few times and he said he was fine. However, when I got home he didn\u2019t look well at all and I could tell his breathing wasn\u2019t fine. In hindsight I realise I should\u2019ve cancelled on Emma and taken BF to urgent care as soon as I got home, but I didn\u2019t. Because BF claimed he was fine and only needed some Panadol and Salbutamol. And as he should know better than I how he\u2019s feeling and is medically trained I stupidly took his word for it.\n\nSo I started getting myself ready for the celebration. About 45 min later our child (6F) shouted that BF was being sick. He\u2019d been sick all over the floor and was struggling to breathe. He said he wasn\u2019t feeling that well. I decided he needed to go to urgent care so I called my parents to have them come get our child and dad offered to drive us.\n\nI needed to clean the floor but as I started BF decided to get up but got dizzy and ended up on the floor. He was starting to panic and as I tried calming him down I realised we couldn\u2019t drive him so I called for help. Shortly after my parents arrived.\n\nThen the ambulance arrived. BF was burning up so they stripped him down and started treating him before taking him to A&E. In the ambulance I texted Emma. I didn\u2019t want to be dramatic so I wrote \u201cSo sorry but can\u2019t come. BF is not doing well. Have lots of fun\u201d.\n\nAs we got to A&E he was given more treatments but as he wasn\u2019t improving they had to take him to the ICU. After a couple of hours and they started to talk about sedating and intubating him. Up until then I had been at his side but at that point embarrassingly sort of broke down. So FIL went to be with BF while I went outside crying with my dad.\n\nWhen I had calmed down I found that I had several missed calls from Emma, her BF and some friends. The texts read that I was an AH for prioritising my BF having a cold over Emma. Emma\u2019s also said I was rude for cancelling so late, that I should\u2019ve done it in the morning as never intended to come and that I was a coward for ignoring her calls. No one even asked how BF was doing.\n\nI got so mad I sort of lost it and sent this text in our group chat: \u201cBF is in the ICU and might die so I don\u2019t give a fuck about Emma\u2019s party. Please just leave me the fuck alone\u201d. Then I turned my phone off. Next morning my phone was blowing up with texts from worried people. And one from Emma saying \u201cThanks for ruining my party\u201d.\n\nMy other friends have said the party wasn\u2019t ruined but as several of the guests know BF the mood got a bit dampened. Emma told our friends that she won\u2019t talk to me until I apologise. But I don\u2019t want to and think it\u2019s she that owns me an apology. AITA?\n\nEdit: Lots of questions about how BF is doing so I\u2019ll just add it here. He\u2019s thankfully doing a lot better. He\u2019s still in hospital but will hopefully be able to come home in a couple of days.", "created_utc": 1700391349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yup9p/aita_for_not_attending_my_friends_30th_birthday/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If Emma had just accepted your apology for not coming, her party wouldn't have been 'ruined' because you wouldn't have 'blown up' at them telling them what's actually happening. Emma is not a real friend, she didn't give a shit about your boyfriend, she only cared about her party. \n\nGood friends for example: for my friends bachelorette, the night before, all of the bridesmaids hung out and made flower crowns. When I got home, my husband was curled up on the couch in pain. I called my mum and dad, they took him to the hospital (I don't drive and stayed home with our 18 month old). He ended up getting his appendix removed the next morning. I told my friend that I couldn't make her bachelorette party and she was fine with it. They actually even checked in during that day and that night, PLUS the over the next few days to make sure he was doing OK.", "NTA. That's not party ruining. I literally ruined my besties hen party because my sister called me partway and I texted her to find out what was up. Then end up wandering around outside the cafe trying to get her to co-ordinate an ambulance. And then end up being driven by my other best friend to the other side of the country to see my mum in ICU because she'd had a stroke. Like obviously none of that is anyones fault but it did objectively ruin my best friends hen party, she didn't feel like celebrating once all this shit went down and everyone made plans to go home. And she was nothing but a sweetheart about it. How your friend could act like such a self absorbed twit is beyond me. Emma needs to grow tf up.\n\nHow is your bf by the way? Recovering I hope", "NTA and this is how your friend lost a friend I guess. (She doesn't sound like that big of a loss to be honest). Apart from the last sentence I see nothing wrong with what you did and I'd go as far as to say that the word were probably warranted anyways\n\nPs. I hope your bf is feeling better!", "NTA\n\nHow on earth did you ruin her party?\n\nYour BF is seriously ill, what were you supposed to do? Leave him on the bathroom floor in a puddle of vomit, with your child and go to her stupid party.\n\nShe owes you an apology for her nasty text. Do not apologise to her.\n\nYNTA", "I\u2019ll be frank, you\u2019re an idiot if you think YTA in this situation. Real friends would not do that.

Tell that selfish bitch to shove it.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry you went through that and I hope your bf is feeling better. \n\nEmma obviously took things personally and created a mountain out of a molehill (as I\u2019ve done many times myself), but when you explained further, she should have apologized instead of sticking to her mountain. \n\nLet her be. She\u2019ll either come to her senses or not, but you\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA - unfortunately you were dealing with a suddenly escalating medical situation - there was no time for messaging your \"friend\" about her party. It sounds like when things crashed it all happened quickly, and you had not only your partner to support but your (probably terrified) child too. They were rightfully your priority.\n\nI wouldn't have blamed your friend for messaging you to find where you were, maybe being a bit concerned about you for not showing up, but there was no need for them to be unkind and try to undermine your partner's condition. She sounds super immature, despite her age, I would seriously reconsider the friendship, hope your partner is doing well.", "I hope your bf is ok now. NTA. An emergency takes precedence", "Yeah that\u2019s a hard NTA. Hope your partner is ok now. Fuck Emma", "You're NTA. \n\n>they had to take him to the ICU.\n\n>Emma saying \u201cThanks for ruining my party\u201d.\n\nYour so called friend is an egotistical piece of work. She's turning *30 years old* and she is so lacking in empathy for others that her concern here is the mood of her party. That is incredible.\n\nI hope he is recovering.", "NTA.\n\nThe only thing you could\u2019ve maybe done differently is be clearer when you said \u201cBF is not doing well.\u201d If my friend missed an important celebration and that was the only thing I knew about it, I could see being pissed off about it at first. \n\nHowever, you were in an AMBULANCE at the time and in no way should you have been worried about your friend, her party, or her reaction. She in no way should have complained about it to other people such that they were sending you messages about it. Once she/they realized the severity of the situation, they all should have fallen all over themselves apologizing for their horrible behavior and asking how they could support you and your BF. \n\nYou could maybe forgive her initial reaction since she didn\u2019t have all the info, but even after she knew and STILL blamed you for detracting from her birthday and thinks that you owe HER an apology? She\u2019s not just an AH she\u2019s totally delusional.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's 30 ffs. He is in icu!", "Hope your boyfriend is okay.\n\nIt's okay to drop Emma as a friend. It's one thing to be angry when she thought that you skipped the party because your SO had a common cold but once she learned the truth, she should have aplogized and asked about him.

Btw, is he good??", "You need new better friends asap", "NTA. \n\nYou couldn't come, you text Emma to let her know, she should have gone on with her night and then the next day spoken with you about what happened and then decided if she was upset or not.

You did fine in being short about the details but cancelling. You don't ruin a party by cancelling, Emma ruins her own party by not just moving on with her party and enjoying herself. \n\nShe ruined her own party further by having her friends reach out to you and give you a hard time, without any of them having the facts. If I had a friend like Emma bitching about  another friend in a similar situation, I'd never text them. I'd nod along with Emma and tell her to forget about it and have a good time, and if I knew you well too, I'd text you to ask if BF was okay and leave it at that. \n\nAll these people behaved badly, except for you.

How could she not care or even pretend to care about how he was doing.", "That\u2019s true! I wouldn\u2019t have written that had she just been fine with me not coming.

Still in hospital but will probably be able to get home in a couple of days.", "Agreed!", "I guess she thinks I ruined it because some people at the party got worried after my text, and talked about it instead of giving her 100% attention or something.

But as it\u2019s starting to calm down now I think I\u2019ll see it clearer.", "Exactly, it all happened quickly when it got so bad. And yes, our child was terrified and crying. It was extremely stressful before my parents arrived because it was quite impossible to take care of them both. So as you say, I didn\u2019t really have the time to text her before I did.", "That\u2019s what I thought too. \n\nHe\u2019s soo much better now, and will be completely fine.", "I agree she absolutely is. Honestly I find her behaviour bewildering and I didn\u2019t think this of her.

I just wanted to write something quickly that wasn\u2019t too dramatic.

But I can get that she got disappointed at me for not coming if she thought it was a cold. And even though I think she could have handled it nice and asked instead of sending rude messages and complaining to our friends about me not showing up, I would happily have accepted her apology had she offered one instead of saying that I ruined her party. \n\nLike the other two friends she got to text me did. Following morning I saw that they had written as soon as they saw my chat message that they were so sorry and were extremely worried about me and BF.
