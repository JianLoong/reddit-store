In the morning he had a temperature but was otherwise relatively ok so we took it as nothing too serious. As he wasn\u2019t fit to go to Emma\u2019s celebration I texted her that only I would come.\n\nAt work I texted BF a few times and he said he was fine. However, when I got home he didn\u2019t look well at all and I could tell his breathing wasn\u2019t fine. In hindsight I realise I should\u2019ve cancelled on Emma and taken BF to urgent care as soon as I got home, but I didn\u2019t. Because BF claimed he was fine and only needed some Panadol and Salbutamol. And as he should know better than I how he\u2019s feeling and is medically trained I stupidly took his word for it.\n\nSo I started getting myself ready for the celebration. About 45 min later our child (6F) shouted that BF was being sick. He\u2019d been sick all over the floor and was struggling to breathe. He said he wasn\u2019t feeling that well. I decided he needed to go to urgent care so I called my parents to have them come get our child and dad offered to drive us.\n\nI needed to clean the floor but as I started BF decided to get up but got dizzy and ended up on the floor. He was starting to panic and as I tried calming him down I realised we couldn\u2019t drive him so I called for help. Shortly after my parents arrived.\n\nThen the ambulance arrived. BF was burning up so they stripped him down and started treating him before taking him to A&E. In the ambulance I texted Emma. I didn\u2019t want to be dramatic so I wrote \u201cSo sorry but can\u2019t come. BF is not doing well. Have lots of fun\u201d.\n\nAs we got to A&E he was given more treatments but as he wasn\u2019t improving they had to take him to the ICU. After a couple of hours and they started to talk about sedating and intubating him. Up until then I had been at his side but at that point embarrassingly sort of broke down. So FIL went to be with BF while I went outside crying with my dad.\n\nWhen I had calmed down I found that I had several missed calls from Emma, her BF and some friends. The texts read that I was an AH for prioritising my BF having a cold over Emma. Emma\u2019s also said I was rude for cancelling so late, that I should\u2019ve done it in the morning as never intended to come and that I was a coward for ignoring her calls. No one even asked how BF was doing.\n\nI got so mad I sort of lost it and sent this text in our group chat: \u201cBF is in the ICU and might die so I don\u2019t give a fuck about Emma\u2019s party. Please just leave me the fuck alone\u201d. Then I turned my phone off. Next morning my phone was blowing up with texts from worried people. And one from Emma saying \u201cThanks for ruining my party\u201d.\n\nMy other friends have said the party wasn\u2019t ruined but as several of the guests know BF the mood got a bit dampened. Emma told our friends that she won\u2019t talk to me until I apologise. But I don\u2019t want to and think it\u2019s she that owns me an apology. AITA?\n\nEdit: Lots of questions about how BF is doing so I\u2019ll just add it here. He\u2019s thankfully doing a lot better. He\u2019s still in hospital but will hopefully be able to come home in a couple of days.", "created_utc": 1700391349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yup9p/aita_for_not_attending_my_friends_30th_birthday/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If Emma had just accepted your apology for not coming, her party wouldn't have been 'ruined' because you wouldn't have 'blown up' at them telling them what's actually happening. Emma is not a real friend, she didn't give a shit about your boyfriend, she only cared about her party. \n\nGood friends for example: for my friends bachelorette, the night before, all of the bridesmaids hung out and made flower crowns. When I got home, my husband was curled up on the couch in pain. I called my mum and dad, they took him to the hospital (I don't drive and stayed home with our 18 month old). He ended up getting his appendix removed the next morning. I told my friend that I couldn't make her bachelorette party and she was fine with it. They actually even checked in during that day and that night, PLUS the over the next few days to make sure he was doing OK.", "NTA. That's not party ruining. I literally ruined my besties hen party because my sister called me partway and I texted her to find out what was up. Then end up wandering around outside the cafe trying to get her to co-ordinate an ambulance. And then end up being driven by my other best friend to the other side of the country to see my mum in ICU because she'd had a stroke. Like obviously none of that is anyones fault but it did objectively ruin my best friends hen party, she didn't feel like celebrating once all this shit went down and everyone made plans to go home. And she was nothing but a sweetheart about it. How your friend could act like such a self absorbed twit is beyond me. Emma needs to grow tf up.\n\nHow is your bf by the way?

I hope your bf is feeling better!", "NTA\n\nHow on earth did you ruin her party?\n\nYour BF is seriously ill, what were you supposed to do? Leave him on the bathroom floor in a puddle of vomit, with your child and go to her stupid party.\n\nShe owes you an apology for her nasty text. Do not apologise to her.\n\nYNTA", "I\u2019ll be frank, you\u2019re an idiot if you think YTA in this situation. Real friends would not do that.

Tell that selfish bitch to shove it.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry you went through that and I hope your bf is feeling better. \n\nEmma obviously took things personally and created a mountain out of a molehill (as I\u2019ve done many times myself), but when you explained further, she should have apologized instead of sticking to her mountain. \n\nLet her be. She\u2019ll either come to her senses or not, but you\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA - unfortunately you were dealing with a suddenly escalating medical situation - there was no time for messaging your \"friend\" about her party. It sounds like when things crashed it all happened quickly, and you had not only your partner to support but your (probably terrified) child too. They were rightfully your priority.\n\nI wouldn't have blamed your friend for messaging you to find where you were, maybe being a bit concerned about you for not showing up, but there was no need for them to be unkind and try to undermine your partner's condition. She sounds super immature, despite her age, I would seriously reconsider the friendship, hope your partner is doing well.", "I hope your bf is ok now. NTA.

She in no way should have complained about it to other people such that they were sending you messages about it. Once she/they realized the severity of the situation, they all should have fallen all over themselves apologizing for their horrible behavior and asking how they could support you and your BF. \n\nYou could maybe forgive her initial reaction since she didn\u2019t have all the info, but even after she knew and STILL blamed you for detracting from her birthday and thinks that you owe HER an apology?

Following morning I saw that they had written as soon as they saw my chat message that they were so sorry and were extremely worried about me and BF.

Told. Her. Friends. That. He. Had. A. Cold.", "I once read that those born without a brain can live no more than a few hours. Emma broke the system by living to be 30)))", "What did the friend do that was so terrible?", "As I understand it, including \"YTA\" in a top-level comment counts as a vote. I suggest changing it to \"Y T A\" and adding an explicit \"NTA\".", "No because if she would have told exactly Emma would have accused her again of trying to ruin her party. Not to mention when you are in a crisis you don't have the head to think about what people doing ok would Interpret your message.", "Op replied he's better in a comment", "Bf wasn't an ah . He didn't know he'd be getting so bad and didn't want to ruin her evening.\n\nIf he knew he wouldn't have kept the son with him at home.", "I completely agree, and I am slightly cross with him for it. But of course I\u2019m mostly happy and relieved he\u2019s doing better.", "Lacking empathy that her friends boyfriend had a cold (as she thought).  Yall don\u2019t even read the post. You just go OPE OP is a woman. N t a.", "Man your friends must love how self-centered you are.", "Fun fact: people\u2019s medical info is no one\u2019s business. All they needed to know was that he was sick and that\u2019s it.", "Well I actually didn\u2019t tell her that. That\u2019s her interpretation of what I said.\n\nIn the morning I told her that BF had a temperature and therefore couldn\u2019t attend, but that I would. Later I told her I couldn\u2019t come as BF was not doing well - I didn\u2019t say anything about a cold.\n\nAs I told her I would attend despite his temperature in the morning I assumed she would understand that he had gotten worse since then. But I admit the text was not that eloquent.", "Your comment\u2019s about as useful as a chocolate teapot here mate, no one held you at gunpoint and made you read the post.", "I think you are insulting the 13 y o . There are quite a number of them who aren't selfish absorbed ah with no empathy", "No 13-year-old I know is this selfish.", "NTA and you didn't ruin anything. She was an ah for making such a scene about you not coming to a party in the end and you just set the record straight with the ah s berating you.\n\nYou don't owe anyone an apology at all they owe you one for speaking without knowing the facts and berating you", "Is she so dull that your attendance was necessary for her party's success? Or is she so insecure that she needs a posse around her? The blow up over your absence, even when they thought it was a cold, is obsurd. You are NTA. Some people have their narcissism barometer turned way up. Take care of you and your family. The rest can sod off.", "Oh my goodness fuck, Emma! What a self-absorbed brat. Glad your bf is doing better!", "Have you missed the last couple of years? Been in a coma through covid? If a friend cancelled late because of \"a cold\" I would assume that it turned out to be worse than that.", "To the boyfriend being in the *fucking ICU*.", "No it wasn't. They were reading into you not responding Thing that weren't real and insulting you.\n\nYou only told them the truth which if they know you and you don't cancel stuff just willy billy usually they should have known this was serious", "It wasn't over the top though, imo. Your bf was in ICU - and your friends were whinging about a party being ruined. It would have been hard NOT to use the f word in that situation. Seriously you should not have been expected to be thinking \"oh I must explain this to Emma\" while the doctors are talking of putting tubes down your bf's throat.", "Gees she actually has some human beings as friends instead of robots. Ignore the Ah", "So when you told her he wasn't doing well, she (and the others) just assumed that it wasn't that bad and that you were using him being sick as an excuse. Then, when you told them how serious it was, you \"ruined her party.\" There was no way you could have done it right by her standards. Her party was already \"ruined\" when she kept calling you instead of enjoying herself, but that isn't your fault.\n\nIt says a lot about her that she cares more about her stupid party than about your BF being in the ICU. If a friend told me their partner was in the ICU, I'd be worried, not throwing a tantrum because that dampened the mood at my party.", "If she wants attention so much, ask her to the town square and dance like a monkey. I am sorry but your friend sucks.", "does that matter? once emma knows that op\u2019s bf is dying in the icu, that changes things, and she sent the nasty text after she learned about what was going on.", "Idk if my friends bf got sick enough to cancel the outing I wouldn\u2019t be mad. That\u2019s fucking weird as shit. Like maybe I\u2019d be kinda disappointed I can\u2019t chill with my bud, but my first thought would be that either she\u2019s sick, came down with the same stuff. And it could be the flu, it could be the rona, it could just be a bad cold, if that were the case then hell yes keep your sniffly butt home, I can always catch up with you later. Whatever the case was, Emma is not a good friend, who ruins their own good time just because one friend didn\u2019t make it? It\u2019s not like no one showed, she had more than enough people over for her birthday, she just had to find something to be upset about, legitimately made someone\u2019s illness about herself.", "Why are you defending Emma so hard in every thread, my god", "I half wonder if she\u2019s feeling weird about turning thirty and it dialed all her emotions up to 11.", "Speedy recovery to your BF. Update when he well please", "No. You\u2019re the asshole. You ain\u2019t tell anyone he was really bad off.", "You\u2019re definitely Emma lmao. Why so offended?", "Anything else you would have written would have led to the same accusations op.\n\nIf you said you went to emergency she would have accused you of ruining her party all over again. There was no way to win with her", "Thank you.  I thought I read them all. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "He was definitely an AH. As a medical professional he should have realized earlier how big the problem was. Had he reacted earlier, it might not have became as bad. He was so sick he had to be hospitalized, yet he still tried to get up by himself. At this point, it\u2019s just common sense not to do that. That\u2019s super irresponsible of him and he really needs to take better care of himself. He has a child and is risking to make that child a partial orphan with his attitude.", "Sure, him being better is obviously the most important thing!", "Hahaha you\u2019re not very smart, are you? You do realize the friend is a woman too, do you? If I were favoring OP because she\u2019s female, how come I\u2019m not favoring the friend because she\u2019s female too? \nAlso, even if one thinks that their friend cancelled for a minor reason such as a cold, they should ask for more details before going off on them. But that woman kept going even after she knew that he was in the ICU by claiming OP had \u201eruined\u201c her party. How inconvenient that somebody almost died just to ruin her party\u2026", "Yall are being way too understanding. Her friend is absolutely allowed to be PISSED at her friend missing her 30th bc OP ain\u2019t tell her shit. OP you should apologize to your friend, but be prepared that she may not want to hear it.", "Sorry for your loss and congrats on the good friends you have.", "Right? Comments under everyone defending the 30 year olds tantrum.", "When you are sick you don't exactly think clearly especially with fever - influenza so I stay with my opinion that bf isn't an Ah.", "No, she\u2019s not.\n\nIt\u2019s a birthday party, not a wedding or a funeral. Friend is allowed to be *disappointed* that OP wasn\u2019t able to make it, but a full-blown tantrum from an adult woman because her friend decided to stay with her sick partner over attending a party is embarrassingly juvenile. The fact that she didn\u2019t know *how* sick OP\u2019s boyfriend was is completely irrelevant - she made baseless assumptions and they bit her in the ass, as baseless assumptions tend to do. She has no one to blame for her humiliation except herself.", "If OP had told her how bad it was, she would probably have complained about OP ruining her party (as she did later). If a friend told me they couldn't come to my party because their BF wasn't \"doing well,\" I'd assume that it was bad enough that they had to take care of him. The very least Emma could have done is ask about BF before getting all pissy.", "There's a difference between disappointment and anger. Expecting someone to come to your birthday instead of going to the ER with their partner is ridiculous. I'm saying this as someone who had a whole weekend getaway for my last milestone birthday, so I'm not part of the \"birthdays are for babies\" club.", "Thank you \u2764 yeah they are the best I am extremely lucky", "Well, as somebody who had to be hospitalized multiple times: that\u2019s why you don\u2019t wait until the last minute to see a doctor. He could have gone to a gp in the morning when he wasn\u2019t as sick yet. He\u2019s a medical professional. He knows the symptoms", "We've found Emma!", "In theory I agree but you don't want to go regularly at the doctor's office for every small thing either and it takes time if you don't have an appointment so it's inconvenient.", "Christ this joke is tired.", "I get that, but I\u2019m 100% sure that this problem didn\u2019t go from \u201esmall thing\u201c to \u201eICU\u201c in like 5 minutes. And medical professionals do know which symptoms are small, and which might not."]}
