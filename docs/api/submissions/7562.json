I took off work in advance for these classes and I paid in full already. My professor came down with covid and in his email he said, \"I will try to post a video so you have something but no guarantees.\"\n\nI feel like I'm getting ripped off and being dismissed. How hard is it to post a simple reading assignment? Or create an introductory document for us to view? \n\nI sympathize with being sick, but somehow I really doubt the symptoms sprung on him so last minute. I'm frustrated because now my time is wasted and I've learned nothing.\n\nHe said we can email him with questions so WIBTA if I asked him what he expects us to do during this time while he's out?\n\n*EDIT:* Alright, I GET IT. I'm still getting through your 100s of comments and insults but I will eventually read them all and continue replying to better enhance the conversations. Even though my situation isn't entirely understood here, I get that I'm coming across assholey and will reshape my perspective/work on being self sufficient. But please be aware that everyone wishing karmic horrors on me, bandwagon downvoting and attacking my character don't know me in the slightest and have only received a sliver of the situation at hand. \n\nThat said, I know covid is serious, and I go every day with a mask/meticulously cleaning because of it.

And also calm down a bit.", "YTA for your general mentality. You can send an e-mail with questions, but I'd formulate it much more politely.\n\nAlso you might literally put yourself on this guy's bad page from the beginning. do you want that?\n\nI've had Covid a few months ago, and despite being vaccinated, I was REALLY sick. And yeah, I went from mild symptoms to really sick overnight. The first few days I could only get up in blocks of 10-15 minutes between sleeping for hours - I wouldn't have been able to work at all.\n\nAssuming this is an older man - he might have severe symptoms.\n\nAlso - most college classes operate on full time students, not on people having to take specials days off. (I've went back to study as an adult, yes it sucks, but truth is we're the exceptions). I get this inconveniences you greatly, but it sounds more like a you issue than a him issue.", "YTA for your attitude about this. Sorry that you took time off work and your class was canceled but things happen. Sometimes professors get sick too. It\u2019s not for you to decide what someone else can do when they\u2019re sick, especially when you have no idea what symptoms they\u2019re experiencing. \n\nThe most you should do here is ask if there is anything you can do in the meantime. Accept that you might not get a timely response because he\u2019s sick. Read through the syllabus - see what information you can find regarding how each week is structured. Use the time you would have been in class to get started on reading your textbook. If there is an online platform for the page (such as Canvas or Blackboard) see what info or readings you can find there.", "As a college prof, YTA. Covid is super rough and it\u2019s literally the first day in a semester? You\u2019ve missed nothing. Even in a 10 week quarter system, I don\u2019t teach anything real until the second week because there\u2019s so much fluctuation in the roster. You don\u2019t know how many other classes he is teaching and also you\u2019ve never had to field emails from students over instructions that you thought were clear, but apparently were not. It\u2019s a lot of work to think of clear directions and we know that Covid affects the brain heavily. If you\u2019re that worried, there must have been some required text book at the student store, you can literally start reading that and formulating questions. You can probably find videos on the subject on YouTube. Getting ripped off?? He\u2019s a human being who could be drastically ill\u2014you don\u2019t even know whether or not he\u2019s vaccinated. He could literally die and you\u2019re focused on missing one day of class?", "YTA. Holy nightmare student, Batman. It was one day. You have no idea what\u2019s going on with him. Stop being so pretentious. \n\nAlso every time I\u2019ve had covid I\u2019ve found out by waking up feeling like I\u2019ve been hit by a truck. For me, the symptoms are very strong for the first 4 days or so, and then get better.", "YTA \n\nI get it but you\u2019re acting like an entitled brat. You need a full and STRONG lesson on  compassion patience and the things that truly matter. \n\n\nPlease go ahead and bother your Sick teacher with your demands. You will definitely not be a favorite.\n\nHave you considered sending get well wishes rather than demands?", "YTA. If you were in my class, I\u2019d hate you.

Sorry. Professors are people too. They get sick. They have families who get sick and die. Look at the syllabus and read ahead.", "Put it in reverse and ask yourself if you would want to be pressed to do work if you were home sick", "YTA.  Your prof is sick, it happens.  You aren\u2019t being ripped off.  You will still get a full course. Take today to learn empathy. I guarantee it\u2019s more important to learn and practice than the course material.", ">He said we can email him with questions so WIBTA if I asked him what he expects us to do during this time while he's out?\n\nMaybe you could use your free time to learn how to show some basic compassion. YTA lol", "INFO: where's your empathy? Did you lose it? Do you require help finding it again?", "It sounds like you\u2019re concerned because this is a class you think you\u2019re going to struggle in. If that\u2019s the case, definitely don\u2019t press the professor to give you an assignment because you don\u2019t want this professor to think you\u2019re an asshole because you may need to ask questions or get help for assignments later in the semester. And yeah YWBTA. 17 weeks is a standard semester length and the first day of class is considered \u201csyllabus day\u201d and not supposed to be busy.", "YTA - things happen, people get sick.  Wouldn't you hope for some grace from your professor if roles were reversed?  It's not like this is exam crunch time - this is the first day of class.  Be resourceful and take a browse through the text book in order to gain some context of the course if you are that concerned.", "Big YTA. When I got covid, I couldn't even get out of bed for 3 days and couldn't yhink straight for 2 weeks (and still have mindfog months later). Let the person rest", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry you grew up with the mentality that people should still work when they\u2019re sick, but your professor\u2019s priority should be his health, not giving you an assignment.", "Yes you would. Not everyone is the same. \nMajority of people who do get covid doesn't even realize that's what it is until they are pretty ill since it does present quite a few different ways. So yes he may have been find yesterday and last night then woke up this morning very ill..", "YWBTA\n\nwhy not take the initiative and read the first chapter or two and get yourself oriented? Look through the online part and familiarize yourself with how/where assignments should be uploaded. See if there is a place for Class introductions. \n\nTake the initiative and do something yourself while he recovers.", "YTA. COVID ranges from a mild cold to death. Don\u2019t doubt your professor or his symptoms. \n  However, after 2 weeks you can send an email if he is still ill asking him if he is ok and if there is anything you can work on. If he gets nothing to you then I\u2019d say reach out to the school. But sending an email the first day reads out that you don\u2019t care and no one will take your concerns seriously.", "YTA. You think you\u2019re getting ripped off because the professor didn\u2019t get sick on a schedule convenient to you. Get over yourself and learn some compassion, first day of class is usually syllabus day so go read that, then go read the first chapter of your book.", "I'll bet that if you were sick, you'd be throwing a different tantrum saying that the professor OWES you an extended deadline and that they should understand that you're SICK.\n\nShit happens in life. Sometimes classes are cancelled, and life goes on\n\nTypically the first class is spent on going over the syllabus and general expectations for the class.\n\nYou are acting like an entitled jackass who thinks that this class is all about you. Read ahead in your books, read the syllabus, and figure out how to function in the world with other people \n\nYTA", "YTA. Most students would be happy with no further work for the week? Why are you so upset? The poor guy got sick! What do you want him to do? Send you a video of him puking while trying to teach? Jesus. Have compassion. It\u2019s a 17 WEEK COURSE!", "YTA- if you were sick (mind you you dont know what his symptoms are) would you expect him to demand you do something for his class instead of taking care of yourself? Listen, I can understand your frustration but also, I had covid last month and felt perfectly fine one day and the next I had a 103.1 fever. Illnesses are unpredictable symptoms wise and they can spring on you like that! Try to be more sympathetic. It is the first day as well- would he really have assigned anything heavy anyway? My advice is take this as a gift and as a chance to do something else productive if you feel you would be losing out on quality time if not in class! Maybe something you\u2019ve been putting over", "YTA. my husband had covid and it knocked him out for two weeks. sitting up for too long exhausted him. and yes, the symptoms do spring up \"last minute.\" get some empathy and go talk to the admin office about what you can do.", "YTA. You say you sympathize but really, you don't.\n\nTeachers are people. People get sick. Usually, there's going to be a make-up class for missed classes. Deal with it.", "YTA. I strongly suggest you manage your expectations, immediately and dramatically, about your courses moving forward. The professor is not your private tutor. Professors are absolutely and completely within their rights to use sick time, and the degree to which you are inconvenienced by this is completely irrelevant. Your over the top emotional reaction is beyond the realm of what any person would consider reasonable. Do not email your professor in this state.", "YWBTA.  He must have posted the syllabus on whatever portal your university uses.  Start with the reading listed there.  Everyone is (should be) entitled to sick days.", "I hope whatever field you want to go into isn\u2019t people facing. Yikes. A modicum of compassion goes a long way. \n\nYWBTA - even teachers are allowed to get sick. And COVID is still killing thousands of people so it is still a big deal.", "Oh boy after reading your comments YTA and you sound insufferable\n\nYou're an adult. Read the first bit yourself. It is one day.", "YTA if you have a legit question or concern go ahead and ask. Maybe read the syllabus or get ahead on any assigned readings (in my experience there\u2019s usually a section of due dates and readings in the syllabus) but don\u2019t ask for an assignment.\n\nOn another note my husband had Covid back in September and the symptoms did hit hard and fast so don\u2019t assume he\u2019s been feeling sick for a while. Everybody gets sick differently", "YTA. Take the day for what is is, a free day. No work and no school! Enjoy the sun and take a walk. Don't sweat the small stuff. Don't take these free days for granted. Tell your instructor to get well, that's it.", "YTA\n\n\nGeeze he is sick. People don't plan on being sick. You're not getting ripped off ...it's a class .... With many weeks of instruction. Is this how you want people to treat you when you're sick and missing work and school??\n\nYou want to learn...but you're not capable of reading the syllabus and doing some reading on your own!?! Takes no effort to open your textbook and read OP. Do that until he is well enough to assign you guys work. Don't pester him with your awful attitude.", "YTA. There\u2019s nothing keeping you from reading ahead. You don\u2019t need a reading assignment to do that. \n\nIf you\u2019re needing help in the subject and want to get a head start, you can look at different online communities and maybe some online video series that cover it. \n\nBut studying the text will give you the best shot at success. Don\u2019t hound the professor while he\u2019s sick. He\u2019ll be back and you have plenty of time.", "YWBTA by pressing them to give you assignments.  This falls under the category of...stuff happens.  I get that you are a little anxious to get it going, but how much do you know about this course?  This professor?  How sick they may be?  Assuming that this professor has taught this course a few times, they likely know what they are doing and what may be the correct way of going about this.  There are also people that are still getting pretty sick from Covid.", "YTA, if you're that pressed about not having assignments make your own. If you have your materials, just don't have your \"guidance\" for the time being, maybe you should try independently reading for a bit and figuring it out. You can familiarize yourself with everything you have and you can show some empathy for someone who is sick. For all you know, your prof could be hospitalized. Would you really like to have someone hounding you to work while you're hooked up in a hospital bed? You seem like you lack any and all empathy to others.", "We. Are. Not. Robots. Please treat instructors with human decency and respect. If a student is sick I don\u2019t email them to turn in their assignment that day from home. I assume they\u2019re unavailable. When I\u2019m sick I get nauseous if I text or open my phone.", "YTA\n\nIf you're so eager to learn then there's internet, books, articles, literally endless ways to learn.\n\nIf you're doing it because you paid for a \"service\" then you need to wake up and realize it's not a service, it's education. Thinking it's a service leads people to think \"I sat in the seat so I deserve the A\" which I think goes against the intent of education", "OP, just fyi, that professor is most likely not seeing any of the money you\u2019re paying, depending on what school/university this is and how junior vs senior this professor is, he/she is quite possibly underpaid and under a huge amount of stress because professors often have to juggle a shit ton of responsibilities - particularly junior ones. It\u2019s stressful af to be a professor in most cases.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve absorbed the stereotype that professors are people spending their days absent mindedly wandering through ivory towers with not much else on; I can assure you that is NOT the case for 99.9% of professors.\n\nAs others have said, adjust your expectations, be a little proactive in a creative way, and let that professor recover.\n\nAlso: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that his symptoms came so suddenly\u201d - illnesses don\u2019t run on schedules.\n\nYour professor is most likely extremely inconvenienced by this illness him/herself.\n\nI commend that you\u2019re this excited about the course, use that energy to become a great engaged student, not to make a bad impression on the first day.

Get over it.", "Yta.... hope you don\u2019t suddenly come down w any symptoms either. Have some empathy.

Dude have you ever had Covid? I was on my ass for 6 weeks. If my clients were up my ass about even doing the slightest of work I would\u2019ve lost it. Take it up with the school, not your sick professor. Also, this isn\u2019t grade school anymore. Take the initiative.", "YTA if you do, most of my college classes had a syllabus that outlines all the assignments so if you're so pressed for work just do it without bothering a poor sick professor. Or just read the first chapter yourself. Instead of emailing him asking for an assignment just ask for a copy of the syllabus and wish him luck in feeling better. You'll make a much better impression and maybe actually feel good about yourself. You're acting as if you're entitled to get what you want despite extenuating circumstances. And also most professor's have plans for at least one hiccup in the semester. Weather, maintenance,  sickness, deaths - its something every college gets affected by at least once and we're all doing swell so you'll be fine.", "YTA, the professor is sick, let him rest. And if you\u2019ve taken college courses before then you should know that so many professors don\u2019t actually assign anything the first week of classes let alone the first class. The first class is usually going over the syllabus and what the professor expects out of their students. If there is a syllabus, which I imagine there is if this professor has been teaching for awhile, then take the initiative and read the syllabus, the assignments for the semester may already be in it.\n\nAnd can you clarify something, do you actually work on days you are supposed to be in class? If you want to your class seriously, would think that you wouldn\u2019t be working the days your classes are or at the very least during the time you are scheduled to be in class.", "Is there a course timeline? Maybe get ahead on readings.  If there's nothing maybe ask for that or a tip on something to  read for the week.

So if he manages to reply to you, fine, but leave him alone if he does not reply. A phone call to him would be a huge no-no. \n\nFurthermore, people can get sick, especially with Covid. That does not mean you get ripped off, that choice of words is out of line.

I did not get out of bed or fully recover until Day 40, and spent a few days in the hospital on the edge of being vented, before being cleared to get plenty of bed rest. After that, l couldn\u2019t do all the things I used to do - I usually ran about 5k on a treadmill, and did about 20k on the bikes - but now I couldn\u2019t even Clim the stairs. It was a dark fucking period man. For clarification, I\u2019m a fit person with no prior health conditions. \n\nThird time was mild. No taste. Oxygen was low, but nothing to be massively concerned about. Winded when going up stairs. Definitely physically weak. \n\nBecause of it, my immune system is no longer what it once was. Every time I get sick, I am wiped out for longer with worse symptoms. There\u2019s norovirus going around my university, and most people recover within a week. It\u2019s now Day 8, and it\u2019s the first day I haven\u2019t felt like hot garbage. I\u2019ve missed an entire teaching week. Am I gonna go off and rage at the university for not sending me every single bit of work, or am I gonna get off my ass and do some work myself? \n\nCovid can be and is serious; people have died from it. your professor is a human being, and is allowed to get sick.

Gave it a few minutes and realized I\u2019m sweating really bad too and I feel all foggy. Stumble to the bathroom and take my temperature to see I have a fever. Took a test and it popped up positive within like 30 seconds. In the span of 5-10 minutes I went from feeling absolutely fine to miserable. And it got progressively worse for several days.

Yes your teacher has COVID, but he or she also should have had to report back to work last week, so it is not unreasonable to expect that he or she could have planned their first week of lessons BEFORE the first week of lessons.  If he or she is not feeling well enough to go to class and teach, present a whole Zoom lesson, or grade 200 pages worth of essays, I get that, but the expectation is there that they need to begin the class.  We as professors for financial aid purposes are also responsible for taking initial attendance, which means there has to be some sort of barometer for each class to determine if a student is attending.   That can be something like a syllabus quiz or a diagnostic assignment, but if the class is online then there needs to be some sort of assignment for that (in the classroom it is just showing up to class).  \n\n\nNow all that being said, if you send the email, you are unlikely to get anywhere.  Professors are like students.  Some of them are gung ho and complete everything early.  Some of them are lazy and don't even think about doing something until after it is due.  Sounds like your professor is one of of those who is more relaxed in their work style, and if you try to force them into doing things on schedule, you are likely to have them get mad at  you.  I had a professor last semester who told us that they would not be able to grade our work and give us feedback on it until next semester after all the work was due.  So we went all semester without receiving feedback on how to fix major assignments before the next one.  This is ridiculous, but trying to fight that battle in academia is rarely worth it.  What might be more worth your time is dropping this class to add another one that works with your degree.  That way you could find a class that you are excited about and a teach that you might mesh better with.

Contemplated visiting the hospital bad. \n\nSecond time no symptoms whatsoever! oddly the most frustrating as I just could not leave my house at all for 10 days!  Wouldn't have even noticed had I not been testing each day we went to the office.\n\nThird time bad flu -ish but only a day or two of actual bedrest rest of the time I was functional.", "I\u2019ve had it twice now- both very different experiences. Both times though I felt a scratchy throat late in the afternoon and within hours had gone into fully sick mode. \n\nThe first time was early 2020 when it was \u201cpresumed cases\u201d because there was no testing yet. It hit me like a runaway freight train. I was down for almost 2 weeks. Headache, fever, body aches, chills, so exhausted I had to have a two hour nap after getting a glass of water, could not sleep laying down or I\u2019d cough up a lung. Even when the worst of the symptoms cleared up, the fatigue and brain fog lingered for weeks. Ended up being one of the lucky ones to have hair loss *face palm* \n\nSecond time was this past November - confirmed with a test. Was a walk in the park compared to the first time. Day one was a scratchy throat in the late afternoon. Then was 3 days of stronger symptoms (headache, chills, tiredness but not fatigue as much). By end of the 4th day I was feeling good. Some fatigue lingered (but was that the virus or the fact I caught it a week after a time change and 2 weeks after shifting 2 time zones, twice in a week) and I lost my voice for a good month. \n\nETA- second round symptoms.", "I'll pop in too, if that's okay - I had it twice.

I was kind of tired, but I figured it was because of my job, which was super high stress. Luckily it was my day off, so I could go back to bed after breakfast.\n\nI woke up 8 hours later feeling like there were iron bands around my chest. Besides trouble breathing, I also had a hellish cough, a fever that came and went at random, body aches, and waves of migraines. The last one contributed to the COVID Brain Fog - I still do not remember the vast majority of 2020 because of this. I was down for the count for almost 3 weeks, and it took 3 *months* before I was able to walk - just walk, at a reasonable pace - a mile without stopping. Somehow, my parents (whom I live with) never caught it.\n\nNeedless to say, I got fully vaccinated as soon as I could (which thankfully meant almost as soon as vaccines were available, thanks to my job).\n\nNovember 2021, I caught it again. This time, it was a slow takeover of my whole household, and I was actually the last person to get taken down. Mom got it first, and she had all the classic symptoms - no smell, no taste, low grade fever, exhaustion, and a light but persistent cough. She was sick for about a week. Dad was asymptomatic for the first few days, then he got body aches, nausea, headaches, and a sore throat. He was only physically sick for about two days, but tested positive for several days before and after.\n\nI, once again, got hit the hardest. Fever, hard coughing, body aches, trouble breathing, and thankfully this time just headaches instead of full-blown migraines. I was also down for about a week, but it took a month and a half to get back to full strength.\n\nSo, as far as your concern about being fucked up for two weeks if you catch it again: it's a crapshoot. I drew the short straw twice, but the second infection was more like a really bad cold or a mild flu compared to the first. I've also talked to other people who have had it multiple times - some say the second was easier, some say the second was worse by ten, some people were completely asymptomatic the second time around. It's all just down to luck at this point.\n\nIf you *do* get it again (and I hope you don't!), prepare for it to be absolute hell, and hope that you'll be pleasantly surprised.", "You can get it multiple times, especially since there are multiple strains, similar to the flu.", "If you catch Covid you have about 3 months of immunity, if you get your boosters you can still get it it will just be less severe, and you always have a chance at getting long Covid.", "By that same token do you want your first interaction to be an entitled demand?", "\u201cUseless\u201d what an interesting way to talk about get well wishes lol", "I had COVID at the start of last semester and had to miss the first class.

My sister interrupted and impatiently asked if they could get on with the test.  Holy crap did everyone hate her for it.  \n\nBut the story has a fun ending.  That teacher, who didn't appreciate that type of pushy, brown nosing student, flipped the tables and said OK, how about you take the test and if you get 100% I'll give everyone 100%.  My sister confidently agreed.  What she forgot is he always included one non-subject related question in every test.  This time it was who won the world series in x year.  He would give you points just for attempting the question, but she didn't know it so she just left it blank (perfectionist) rather than make a wild guess (just guess the Yankees, statistically it's the best choice).

I struggled a lot with my mental health through uni, and showing how passionate I was and giving my all to the class when I did have the energy and mental capacity to show up definitely saved my ass more than once.", "It's a realistic way. Depending on what your field is, you could possibly  get similar knowledge by reading books and watching YouTube. Most people are not that dedicated or disciplined. A degree basically says: \"yes this person is qualified\", while you could be qualified through other \nexperience, too.", "Exactly my thoughts as well! Ya got the book? Well get to reading! \n\nOP's Edit Comment ..*Even though my situation isn't entirely understood here, -* I think they laid it out quite clearly.\n\nYTA", "The juxtaposition of your username with your kind comment gave me a chuckle.", "Yeah mine have been read syllabus and do enrollment verification", "Lol, I gave a two question homework and a super low stakes quiz (like didn\u2019t even count towards their grade, I was checking reading comprehension/general ability levels so I could better gauge the students\u2019 needs) for the second class once and there was a revolt. I can\u2019t imagine what would happen if I gave an assignment for the first class.", "I sort of agree and disagree.  I don't know what it's like at a lot of other schools, but in my experience at the schools I went to and from what I understand of schools friends went to, it's to be expected to have the semester paid for before the first day of classes.    Like I said, it might be different school to school, but that's just my understanding of it, so the payment of tuition part seems a bit irrelevant since the general norm is for tuition to be paid before the start of classes.  But you are right in the fact that they are justified in their feelings.  I will never invalidate someones feelings, especially if they are under preconceptions of how a particular situation should go, but the way OP is approaching the situation is incredibly insensitive.", "I too went camping. My boyfriend at the time when I picked him up for camping said his roommate had just gotten sick (didnt know it was covid) and so not to come into the house, and all the camping gear was in the garage. Day 2 of 3 of camping roo.ate calls and says it's covid. Day 3 and final day my ex was starting to feel sick. We tried desperately to find a covid test on day 4 and eventually found some. He tested positive, I was negative. By the end of day 4 he was miserable. I dropped him off at home and went home myself. The next day I felt sick and tested positive. Covid seems to have permanently fucked my tastebuds. Things randomly taste like different foods. Like lamb tastes like dirt, my roast beef sandwich tasted like oranges, and food frequently will taste so rancid I have to spit it out immediately or I'll throw up but tastes perfectly normal to the rest of my family.", "What shitty timing. Sorry!", "Doctor is fairly certain the variant I caught last month was Kraken and I am still feeling like shit almost a month later. Have been testing negative, but it's rough. May none of you get it xoxo", "Our office flooded over the holidays and everyone keeps complaining about how musty it smells. I wouldn't know, can't smell or taste much of anything. I miss my sense of smell so much.", "It\u2019s like you\u2019re completely disregarding the impact COVID has had on many universities and the burnout its caused, you\u2019re so demanding smfh get a grip, the world has changed and we need to be adaptable. I had professors cancel class for being sick before COVID and I cannot fathom reacting the way you and OP are", "We got assignments too, for each of my degrees. And never a heads up, just an expectation to read the syllabus! Lol", "I had one professor *give us an assignment before day one of class*. WTF. I dont remember where we were supposed to have found this assignment, (a long time ago-pre internet days), but he was butt hurt that we, as a group, hadn\u2019t noticed the assignment and walked into class with it done.", "Yep... I didn't feel anything but a scratchy throat the first night. Next morning felt exhausted. Proceeded to spend the next two weeks in a half-delerious state, flat out in bed, doing nothing but sleeping and occasionally crawling to the landing on the stairs to get food my roommate dropped off. Usually just a slice of toast, as it was all I could manage.\n\nOn one day I thought I was feeling better and managed to sit up and play Pok\u00e9mon for like 30min. Proceeded to be unable to do anything else but sleep and drag myself to the toilet for the following day and a half. And a couple times I had to force myself to get up for the toilet. Pretty sure I fell asleep in there a couple times.\n\nCovid was awful.\n\nEdit to add: the cough didn't go away for months, and thanks to another condition I have, said coughing resulted in me spraining 4 different ribs and eventually dislocating one, with a suspected minor fracture. That rib STILL hasn't gone entirely back into place, and it's been 10mo.", "This latest round was awful. I had it when it first made the rounds in 2020 and it was 5 weeks of sounding like a Harbor Seal and being winded walking across the room. This round? Was absolutely fine until I wasn\u2019t. I thought I was catching a cold so I went to bed a bit early. Spent 2+ weeks in bed, while hubby and daughter were down for 1 week with it. People who just say off the cuff that Covid \u2018isn\u2019t that bad\u2019 either had an extremely mild case or are talking out their backside. Hands down I would rather lick a hedgehog against the quills than have Covid again.", "Yikes. You had to raw dog it (pre-vax).", ">Deal with it like a grown up (ie. go day drinking).\n\nDamn, I wish I had an award to give you. I'm a student and I *felt this*", "I don't want to down play your symptoms but if you could canoe for 1.5 hours I think you are exaggerating, I had covid 3 times and wasn't vaccinated for any of them (I'm not anti Vax I just couldn't be bothered) and I wouldn't say my symptoms were that bad but I definitely wouldn't have survives a canoe trip", "Yup. Caught it twice in six weeks. Was not happy", "Oh yea I always wear my mask. I will admit there have been times where I run in and out of a store real quick and forget it but especially in medical facilities and my kids schools which are the only places I go. I'm mildly agoraphobic so trust me I'm just as shocked as you are I've had it that many times.", "In my mind, I'm picturing that student doing the slow slide down his chair onto the floor and staying there until everyone leaves...", "Please tell me he wasn\u2019t a local. Because my only other explanation is that he drove a lifted truck with snow chains on the tires", "And we can't forget the kid who reminds the teacher they forgot to collect the homework. Who was the same kid who, when we had the teacher engaged in a discussion and were all watching the second hand on the clock and counting down for the bell, would yell out \"Wait a minute! What about homework?\"", "I've had that experience too.  Got into the habit of pre reading the syllabus real quick before the start of classes.  I didn't hate it but it wasnt awesome either.", "Yeah your professor just sounds like they didn't have realistic expectations.  People like that do odd things like that and then go, \"Why are you all failing my class?\" Gee I don't know maybe cause you have unrealistic expectations of us? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I had covid right now, peaked Friday through Sunday. I had to send one urgent simple work email on Sunday and it took the life out of me and everything in ten city blocks around me.", "I go stir crazy too, and the moment I knew I was actually getting better was when I realized I was BORED. I was just too exhausted to care til that point.", "I have chronic pain/migraines. You'd be surprised what you can push yourself through when you're used to suffering. It was really, really hard. It was also a trip I had been looking forward to for 6 months and if we didn't go we wouldn't get another vacation for at least a year. We just took breaks when we needed to. We're both experienced paddlers and had been there before so we made it work. \n\nAlso don't forget this was 6 days after the start of our covid (5 day quarantine) so the really awful first few days where I couldn't get out of bed were done. I packed a lot of meds and babied myself once we actually arrived. Lots of naps and very little activities. We had wifi at that site so spent a lot of time on our phones (packed 5 battery packs lol). It wasn't a perfect trip but it was better than staying home.", "Oh no- I just looked that up as I\u2019m unfamiliar- I hope you got & continue to get high quality care & don\u2019t have any scarring. Chronic health issues can rob us of so much. I hope this doesn\u2019t.\n\nBig hugs to you and your husband if you like them. The only time I don\u2019t mask in public is if I\u2019m at a dispensary (chronic pain patient). \n\nYou are most welcome. It is a small thing to do to help care for myself & others. It is more than worth it.", "Even then I had the flu so bad once I was hallucinating. A friend ended up dying from complications of the flu. Even if he\u2019s thinking that it\u2019s just the flu, that\u2019s still something that can hospitalize and kill you.", "I think people who say this have never truly had the flu. \n\nMost people think the flu is just like a bad cold and it's not. It's really nasty.", "People often underplay how bad a flu can be. Most people will get flu symptoms with it but most people call any bothersome cold a \"flu\". A flu can literally take months to recover from. Bed ridden and sick for weeks, people dismiss flus can be.", "I also have chronic pain and chronic migraines\u2026can attest to the fact that sometimes you get used to \u201cpowering through\u201d even when you know it\u2019s not good for you.", "I\u2019ll take the hugs, and yes, it\u2019s being kept on top of.\nI have a card for dispensery use. Can you PM me about what you use for chronic pain? I have fibromyalgia and degenerative arthritis \ud83d\ude43", "I'm actually really happy you've managed to avoid it for this long. I hope you never get it. It can feel like simple cold or feel like you're actually going to die. Stay healthy!", "I've had it twice. Once before we even knew covid had spread outside of China and once in the last few months. The first time was unbearable. I was having fever dreams for days and so foggy I accidentally shoplifted some juice just out of an inability to notice I had it in my arm while I scanned everything else. I didn't know it had been covid until I got it a few months ago and the symptoms were the same as that week almost 3 years before, just milder now as I've been vaccinated. I probably should have gone to the Dr the first time but I was a broke college student and couldn't even afford to miss the shift I had to work the morning it first got bad muchless a Dr visit copay.\n\n\nGetting it badly is completely awful and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.", "That's how you know someone's never actually had the flu. I haven't had the flu, but I frequently get migraines that make me completely useless. I often get the \"you're just being lazy - it can't be THAT bad\" when I say I can't get out of bed or keep my eyes open. Some people just don't understand illnesses because they've been lied to about what those illnesses actually are. Ignorance breeds ignorance.", "Yes exactly! It's like the worst super power lol", "Excellent. Oh boo fibro & arthritis!!! Oh totally, I have scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis & some deformed ribs that might force surgery. Scoliosis is considered an arthritic condition. Anyone else wanting some medical cannabis thoughts, come thru on my PM\u2019s!"]}
