One is an honors student but didn't score as high on a test. One comes from a privileged well connected background and had the advantage of all the tutors. Another did not.  So we really need to stop with the logical fallacies of bringing in non factors into an issue when the real question is how well they performed in M1-M4 and during their residency.

They fought to be where they are and being an affirmative action doesn't mean they are bottom of the food chain either. It does mean they topped other candidates and will continue to put the effort in.\n\nthe second on the other hand is a possible no. getting into a school when they may lack the passion won't make them a good doctor. goofing off because they have that luxury makes me think they will be a doctor near the bottom of the class. and in their case this might not be because they tried and school was hard but rather they are a bare minimum doctor, hopefully when in practice they would outgrow it.", "Well, both scenarios you presented are bad.", "The US is steeped in racism and bigotry. So for generations, people of color were kept out of high paying jobs. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964, you could finally sue employers or schools that refused to consider people because of race. If your company or school was sued and found guilty of discrimination, part of the penalty is that you had to prove that you made changes to your criteria, to be more fair. That is called taking \"affirmative action\" to remedy the issue. You have to be able to show a concrete change in behavior. Eventually, people started taking affirmative steps so they didn't have to get sued on the first place.

With affirmative action what has happened is they have opened up the pool to more people for acceptance but ultimately over the course of times school they still have to do the work properly and maybe even go above and beyond because they know they have a target on their back. For the family resident you are actively making them less accountable and a worse physician by letting things go because of who they are related to.", "Ahhhh so what they\u2019re basically asking is if they would want a person to become a physician that in their opinion only got in to fill a quota? \n\nThanks for the explanation!", ">With affirmative action what has happened is they have opened up the pool to more people for acceptance but ultimately over the course of times school they still have to do the work properly and maybe even go above and beyond because they know they have a target on their back.\n\nThey have also artificially narrowed the pool size for Asian Americans, such as myself. I have a doctorate in a healthcare profession, and I witnessed first hand how Asians were discriminated against simply for being too high-achieving in my academic setting as well as others. \n\nMy children will likely suffer the same, but I guess since we\u2019re not the \u201cright\u201d color of minority few people will care.", "Legacy admissions are 45% more likely to get into highly selective colleges. It\u2019s more convenient to attack affirmative action as the boogeyman because the people in power benefit from legacy admissions.
