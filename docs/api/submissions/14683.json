It does mean they topped other candidates and will continue to put the effort in.\n\nthe second on the other hand is a possible no. getting into a school when they may lack the passion won't make them a good doctor. goofing off because they have that luxury makes me think they will be a doctor near the bottom of the class. and in their case this might not be because they tried and school was hard but rather they are a bare minimum doctor, hopefully when in practice they would outgrow it.", "Well, both scenarios you presented are bad.", "The US is steeped in racism and bigotry. So for generations, people of color were kept out of high paying jobs. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964, you could finally sue employers or schools that refused to consider people because of race. If your company or school was sued and found guilty of discrimination, part of the penalty is that you had to prove that you made changes to your criteria, to be more fair. That is called taking \"affirmative action\" to remedy the issue. You have to be able to show a concrete change in behavior.

That's just asking for future lawsuits. I would call all of these people out for their bullshit and make it as public as possible if they make any threats towards my job. I would rather go down burning before I let someone get by with nepotism in a profession like healthcare.", "NTA - people's lives are at stake ; no way should you go easy on anyone. I'd report the person who called you names", "NTA. Nepotism is a cancer that should not be allowed to spread.", "NTA but I would also probably report your coworker to HR. That kind of attitude of overlooking mistakes in the medical field is dangerous.", "You mean rich entitled asshole.", "Agreed. Sounds like the friendship needs reevaluation.", "Depends on whether the friend works at the same place or not.  But I'd definitely flag that I got a call to \"take it easy\" because of literal nepotism.", "their punishment was to do work that would make them more familiar and not make the mistake. that isn't hazing, thats training doctors to save lives.", "I agree with what you're saying, but its also important to add: For all anyone knows every white applicant only got their position because their parents donated to the institution. \n\nThe thing about suggesting any person of color might be an \"Affirmative Action recipient\" is that it reinforces the idea that white candidates are hired because of merit, but affirmative action relaxes qualifications. The point behind Affirmative Action is to find qualified applicants who have been overlooked because selection processes tend to find people like the ones they already hired. \n\nIts not always implemented perfectly, of course. But its odd that so many people criticize Affirmative Action for not being perfect, when the alternative is grossly imperfect as well.", "The problem is with the existence of affirmative action. \n\nWhy should the consumer assume that risk, or play identity politics roulette with their health? Who are you to assume what risk someone should take with their health? Are we going to call cancer patients bigots because they want the best possible care?\n\nWhy would you risk getting a doctor who may have benefited from affirmative action as opposed to someone who may have had it harder getting into the program? The policy incentivizes racism of its own accord.", "People who have good fortune tend to continue having good fortune. The person who is a mess is not in any way more likely to improve as the one with flawless form.\n\nThe comment above me is a fairy tale underdog story that people love to hear. But those cases are the exception, not the rule. Especially in the medical field where test standards are being lowered due to affirmative action.\n\nI'm all for affirmative action when it qualifies for people who have the talent, but not the funding to do so. When you have to lower standards, we all lose.", "It's also worth noting that statistically speaking (at least the last time I checked) the group that benefits most from affirmative action is white women, which just makes the claim that a person of color who got into a program without merit even more egregious and infuriating", "Affirmative action as it is currently practiced in the US does exactly that, admit students whose objective qualifications are lower but who are of a particular set of races. \n\nThe theoretical version of two equally qualified applicants is what gets presented but it isn't what is currently being practiced (nor was it what was being practiced at any point in the big affirmative action lawsuits). \n\nFor example, look at the underlying facts from Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, which us currently pending before SCOTUS. Harvard has been admitting black students with objective metrics that would get any other race rejected, and rejecting Asian students with scores that would get any other race admitted in a heartbeat. \n\nThe previous case about the University of Michigan was even worse.", "NTA, The son of the baseball or football coach is forced to work harder than most people in my experience. This son should be the shining pupil of whoever the important person is, not someone to slack off with.", "NTA, better report this to HR and then you need to start looking somewhere else to work because you will get retaliated against.  People with privileges who do this type of thing will abuse their privileges to come after you. If you get out of range before they strike your career might survive.", "I hate the B word, and I especially hate it when a man uses the term towards a woman!", "The mental gymnastics of his dad is important so ignore mistakes that could literally harm patients.  Report your co-worker, because who knows if others are actually doing as he asked.  NTA.", "I bet if you were a man you wouldn\u2019t have even received a phone call.", "You should inform whoever is in charge of him. That type of behavior could hurt him (the nephew) or give him a very bad reputation in the future.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA", "NTA.  He's there to learn.  He's learning.", "NTA. As someone who has been new to jobs before, it's important to point out mistakes or slip ups to help insure they don't happen again. If anything, the extra work you gave him should be a good reminder to be vigilant and make sure you're doing things correctly.", "NTA on any level.  You did your job and may have helped a patient in the future b/c now they will hopefully learn from their mistake", "I would report this to what ever HR  is in the system.\n\nYou did the right thing, treated him fairly.

CYA take your foot off of this snake. This can negatively affect your career, it\u2019s best to let it go. Unfortunately his lack of care and follow through will be apparent as he goes through the program.

This guy is there to learn, if you don\u2019t correct their mistakes, they don\u2019t learn, it\u2019s that simple. A little extra work is hardly a devastating consequence.  \nI don\u2019t know if it will cause more trouble than it\u2019s worth for you, but I would be considering reporting your colleague for asking for special treatment and calling you names.", "NTA! What if you did \"take it easy on him\" and he goes on to make that mistake  or a different one and literally killed someone?  I MIGHT be able to understand if it were a business student or a communications major or something like that, but you would still NBTA. Also, \"his father is an important person\" COOL! Does he want a cookie? I'm so over people using that as an excuse to be a shit human being.", "NTA. There must be an HR equivalent of someone you can report this to. If this student has their uncle trying to lobby for them to get preferential treatment, that\u2019s a major problem.", "Oh, I have had this EXACT argument with family.  Except I said I would prefer the affirmative action doctor because I knew they had to work twice as hard to get in.", "I agree with you, but never really had a good response in my head for those people. \n\nBut as it turns out, through work and family, I know a lot of doctors and some pretty highly regarded ones in their field. One time, a doctor came into a practice and he was kind of a twit. Real entitled. He left not too many years after joining. Somewhat later, I found out why. He was a terrible orthopaedist. The final straw was an elbow surgery that should have only taken a couple of hours took six or seven and needed to be fixed again later. This combined with other bad doctoring meant he had lost privileges at all the local hospitals. He ended up in some small town somewhere that had no other choice. \n\nThat guy was a doctor because of family connections. \n\nAnyway, the theoretical scenario I mentioned was kinda not 100% theoretical.", "I can't speak to the post-grad schools, but every Ivy undergrad class accepts legacies, disproportionately in my experience.", "I used the term many instead of all. That was deliberate. \n\nI\u2019ve seen women accused of \u201caffirmative action\u201d even for merit based cases. For example, one woman engineer was accused of getting a scholarship because she was a woman. She had a 3.7 GPA, he had a 2.8 GPA. And the scholarship was\nGrade merit based. It is this sort of illogic logic that I\u2019ve many times seen when the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d is thrown around."]}
