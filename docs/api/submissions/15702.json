That's all appropriate IMO, where you think it's an indication of thin-skinned. \n\nThen, I've been called a f too many times to count in my lifetime. Yes, I'm gay; I stopped being angry about this BS when I started calling it out. Every bloody time, even when the person claims I'm just thin-skinned. \n\nIf someone comments on my handwriting's gender presentation, you can bet I'm going to ridicule their ass into sunset.", "Genuinely, thank you for this :) I might be a bit dramatic as emotions of the day all flood back at night time for me but I definitely have some self-reflecting to do.

Letting it eat at you after the fact, especially to the point where you finish your work day, go home, and think about it enough to start wondering AITA? is the part where that comes into play.

His response was completely appropriate. But wouldn't it be great if we could give OP some tools so that the next time something like this happens, he could just dismiss it out-of-hand and it would be one less thing weighing on his mind when he gets home to decompress?", "That sounds like about the best way to unwind.\n\nIn all honesty, just knowing that you have a tendency to be sensitive/thin-skinned(not meant offensively) is often enough. Most teenagers tend to be; I know I was at that age, and I increasingly believe self-confidence grows as you age.\n\nIf I may offer some advice, the next time you have a moment like this, ask yourself: Am I overthinking tjis? Is this person just making noise? Does their opinion have any bearing on me at all? Am I ever even going to SEE them again?\n\nYour feelings are completely valid, but it really sucks. The old guy you talked to had probably forgotten about your interaction by the time he sat down in his car, because it was just meaningless noise. It would just be nice to try to give you a way to dismiss it as easily.", "Actually, I'm interpreting the phrase \"thin-skinned\" in the way it's commonly used - as an insult. It appears you may have meant it constructively, an entirely new experience for me in 56 years. (It does happen, though I pretend omniscience whereever I can... ) \n\nHaving tools to help decompress and release the anger or upset is different, whether that happens in short order or on a longer span. \n\nAnd on that, I'll say thank you and good night.", "That\u2019s great advice, thank you!

He probably would\u2019ve bitched just as much if he couldn\u2019t read your handwriting and gone on to accuse the school system of being too focused on making you woke. He was just being an asshole.\n\nIf you wanted to take a slightly higher road in the future, you might phrase that response as \u201cthat\u2019s really my concern.\u201d It says the same thing but keeps you more in the clear.", "NTA. Having neat handwriting is an excellent skill, especially if it\u2019s tied to a hobby you love, and the idea that men who take care of their appearance or space or actions are \u2018feminine\u2019 needs to die.", "NTA.  I work with a man who has absolutely beautiful handwriting, and he loves being complimented on it.", "NTA. I wish my handwriting was that nice. No one including me could read what I wrote most days.
