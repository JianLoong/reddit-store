I didn\u2019t change much.\n\nAlso Max couldn\u2019t stand enclosed places or the dark so movie theatres used to suck for him. He really wanted to get over his fear though and when he was 13 he decided to take a girl to the movies.

It was hard but also really fun and it kind of became tradition.\n\nHe can go to the movies whenever now but we have this fixed date every year where we go to the local cinema and watch a random movie. It\u2019s loads of fun.\n\nAnyways, Max, despite being one of the younger couisns, is treated like the eldest. Like I said, he transformed into this crazy mature kid and our one aunt really only trusts him with her kid (Judy-9f). \n\nThe whole family is staying with us for a bit to celebrate my grandma\u2019s birthday and the days overlapped with our movie day.

Max told her. She asked if we could take Judy along. He apologized and said that the movie isn\u2019t appropriate for little kids. She kept begging though and said that the others aren\u2019t mature enough. I noticed Max about to crack so I butted in and said \u201cthat sounds like a you problem\u201d before taking Max\u2019s hand and pulling him out the door. \n\nMax was all like wtf but got in the car anyways and we had a great time. \n\nWhen we got back, our cousins were PISSED. They started yelling at Max for suddenly changing his mind about being Judy\u2019s main babysitter and dumping her on them. When my aunt came home she was ignoring Max completely but was furious at me. She kept making sarcastic remarks about how rude and disrespectful I am and only stopped after my dad asked her what was going on. \n\nI feel really weird now. I know what I did was rude but I know Max, he finds it hard to say no. I just wanted to do one thing for him but it feels like I\u2019ve just pissed everyone off and made things hella awkward for Max.

Not even a little bit. They were trying to use your brother and you stopped them.\n\nYour aunt knows that what she wanted to do was wrong. Tell another adult what's going on. Don't cover for her and don't feel guilt over something she did.\n\nNtA", "NTA they are using him and mad you upheld a boundary in a very curt way. Screw them.", "No it really is a her problem they may feel hurt but  that's only because they got used to taking advantage of max. NTA", "NTA - Max is not the designated babysitter. Being \u201cthe mature one\u201d after trauma sucks (been there), because on top of the trauma, you get parentified. He deserves time to himself, to spend time with whoever he wants, especially since this is a yearly tradition. She was wrong for assuming he\u2019d do whatever she wanted and for trying to pressure him.", "INFO; \n\nWhat do your parents have to say about this?\n\nAre they upset Max didn't babysit too? If so they really should stand up for their son instead of the aunt, and the other adult cousins.\n\nthey know his issues. And besides your aunt didn't ask, she just assumed, and then when she tried to plead with him, because she couldn't trust others that made it worse. She was basically trying to guilt him into doing something he didn't want to do.\n\nYour parents need to stand up for him, and tell them all if they don't like it, then leave. And tell the aunt her child is her responsibility.\n\nIf they are on Max's side then why are they allowing them to treat him this way?", "NTA. Your aunt wasn\u2019t taking \u2018no\u2019 for an answer, so there was really no polite way to refuse her.", "NTA\n\nI don't recall reading anywhere that Max actually agreed to babysit. Your aunt shouldn't have assumed she can dump her kid on you and go out for dinner. The fact that she went to dinner with family is irrelevant.", "So, Max has trauma and your family has decided to use the \u201cgrew up too fast\u201d to take advantage? Usually people would want Max to be able to relax and be a kid. Discourage growing up too soon and help him find the ability again. \n\nALSO \nWhat kind of 9 year old can\u2019t be watched over by people in their 20\u2019s? 9 year olds are easy AF? They literally entertain themselves and are old enough not to die doing something dumb like a toddler. \n\nAnyway, of course NTA. \n\nPeople hate boundaries. They do. This is just everyone\u2019s reaction to not getting their own way.", "NTA. It is your aunt's child and 100% HER responsibility not your brothers. There were other adults there and you already this preplanned. While I hope it was a plan that was communicated to everyone before hand, like your aunt, even if it wasn't her reaction and reactions of others are completely disproportionate to the miscommunication that happened. Your brother is not the child's father so there's no obligation to act like one and watch her all the time. Your family needs to get off their high horse and thank you for standing up for him you should be proud of yourself and even if it's awkward now your brother will always cherish the tradition you got to uphold and fought for.", "NTA. Max was being taken advantage of.  People are generally mad when healthy boundaries are enforced that prevent them from taking advantage of someone.", "Nta and tell your parents.  They should know your aunt is treating you rudely for not wanting to watch your cousin", "NTA\nThey were taking advantage of Max. Your aunt should have checked beforehand if he was free to babysit and not just assume that he'll do it.", "YTA for creating a problem for max when you butted in. He should handle his own issues.

You owe him an apology for not allowing him to handle the situation himself.", "The older cousins are pissed because you and Max didn't babysit Judy and they had to. \n\nYour aunt is pissed because she was told no, and she had to find alternate care for her daughter. \n\nBecause you did something FOR Max instead of expecting something FROM him, they are all pissed at you. \n\nNo, you are NTA. Not at all.", "NTA. Max never agreed to be the babysitter.  It should not have been assumed by your aunt that he would.  She wanted to trample his boundary.  Your cousins displaced their frustration with your aunt onto Max.", "NTA if there was no agreement for him to babysit then she shouldn't just expect it she is able to rely on your other cousins who possibly have nothing to do", "Oh they might as well promote your brother to personal maid. Your aunt forgets she has a daughter or what? Tell your cousins they are old enough to take care of judy and your aunt to start acting as mother and how dare she tell your brother what to do? She clearly exploits the situation. NTA and you said too little to all of them, they all should learn their spot.", "NTA, unless he promised he'd babysit at that time. They're taking advantage of his kindness, but instead of standing up for him you should encourage him to stand up for himself. You standing up for him won't help him long term.", "It doesn't matter he's a pushover. Pushovers can learn to say no AND mean it.\n\nInfo, please\n\nYour cousins are mad because he was supposed to be the main babysitter.

Idk if he\u2019ll ever say no now.", "They were being sarcastic and sort of mocking him by calling him the main babysitter. There\u2019s no like official agreement or anything but everyone knows that he watches her often.", "There was no agreement.", "I would try to reassure him that having boundaries is ok and saying no is normal, look at your family they say no all the time. He is worth people caring for him as much as he cares for them. He sounds like an amazing brother and I hope you let him know even perfect strangers are rooting for him and are going through the same problem with saying no he is but remember his needs are just as important as the people asking him.", "Maybe it's just hard for him to see everything objectively because he's living it. Maybe try calculating how many hours a week he babysits for free, convert that into hours per your and how much money he could be making, or spending the time studying, etc. My brother's a pushover and sometimes he just doesn't understand how much others ask of him. Seeing the cold facts usually help my brother, and I hope it will help yours too. Good luck! \n\nLet me know if it works :)", "Then they need for him to help them manage their expectations & tell them no. And stick to it.\n\nOr flip 'em off & walk out.", "Why can't he make a decision for himself?", "**NTA** at all. Your aunt 100% deserved what she got for imposing on Max and making assumptions that way. It's good he at least has you on his side.", "NTA. \n\nyou need to tell your parents whats going on and let them know that uour aunt is trying to manipulate your cousin into being an unpaid babysitter. \n\nThen you need to tell everyone off, that its not your cousins job to babysit your aunts kid.

They are using him because of his trauma.", "Well, break your promise and tell the other adults. You'd be doing it for his own good and you cannot be expected to protect him from them, that's is one of your parents MAIN jobs. They need to know, and seeing how you turned out so great, I bet they'd absolutely want to know...", "You have to tell them. They have the right to know and they have to act.", "Nta, and good for you for standing up for your brother. Some people have kids and develop a sense of entitlement that makes them think they can shame anyone who doesn't bend over backwards to accommodate them. She is going to continue to take advantage of anyone who goes out of their way to help her until people just straight up avoid her for her poor behavior.", "NTA at all.\n\nSure it may have come across a bit rude but your aunt was very entitled in thinking that she could just order you around like that.  She didn't ask Max to baby sit so it's not like he was reneging on a promise.  Your aunt just expected him to be available on her whim.  She wouldn't have expect you to be going out.\n\nIt is your aunt's problem and not a you problem.  And there were other older adults that could look after her.\n\nTell your parents.  Max is trying to shoulder too much of this.  He's still a kid despite trying to show that he's an adult.  He's of adult age but he's still very young.\n\nAnd tell Max not to baby sit his niece again.", "Nope NTA not at all", "NTA. The only other person responsible for watching her kid without notice is the kids other parent. It sounds like she didn't clear this with Max in advance so she's SOL because he has plans.", "NTA.   Tell your parents.  Max is too nice.  He never agreed to babysit.  He didn\u2019t dump Judy on anyone.  The cousins could watch her.  Aunt should have made provisions for a babysitter.  This movie night is a tradition.  Let people know Max did nothing wrong.", "op=NTA\n\nBecause Max clearly had NOT agreed to babysit Judy at that time.  \n\nMax did not change his mind, even if he was about to. The older cousin can just suck it up.", "Did Max agree to babysit for that particular night already and it was a set arrangement? No? Then your Aunt has ZERO right to his time. \n\nTell me, does he have the words \u201cfree babysitter, take advantage of me\u201d tattooed on his forehead? No? Then why does she think it is her right to use him? Does your aunt compensate him for babysitting?\n\nAre your other cousins who are 20+ all suffering from issues that would render them physically or mentally incapable of watching a pre-teen? No? Sounds like they can take a turn. And if they refused your aunt, sounds like she should have made other arrangements. \n\nDo not hide this from other adults. You went through a traumatic experience that forced Max to grow up too quick, she is taking advantage of him. You two had your own planned sibling date night. She had no right to intrude upon that. \n\nI would suggest therapy for Max if he is not already in it. It sounds like he might benefit from someone showing him how to set healthy boundaries and stand up for himself.", "This. NTA. But, OP, you guys need to tell your dad what's going on. I'm a parent, and if this happened I would CHEW all these people out and let them know that Max is never babysitting for them again.\n\nMax sounds like a sensitive soul. Sensitive souls deserve to be protected.", "But you CAN tell your parents that your aunt refused to let adults older than Max watch her kid.  There was zero reason why they couldn't, other than being lazy.\n\nYou were absolutely right that her daughter is a \"her\" problem, not a \"your\" problem, or a \"Max\" problem.\n\nNTA", "You really really need to tell your parents.  Your brother never promised to babysit for anyone", "I think it is reasonable for you to tell Max you won't proactively TELL your parents, but also tell him you will NOT lie.\n\nI think Max probably needs some therapy. His inability to say no will not help him in the future.", "Real quick, this information is going to get spread around the family. Usually it's the people who say nothing that get the shit end of the stick. Its happened to me and I see it on here all the time. You say nothing and your aunt controls the story. She can say whatever she wants because you haven't spoken up and who are they going to believe?

He was very reserved but always kind and respectful, and had trouble saying no. He had an interview for a job that anyone our age would have dreamed of at the time and told me when I called to ask how it went that he didn't go because he had to watch his 12 year old brother at his mother's bidding.\n\nNeedless to say, I unloaded on his mother. Harshly. She demanded that he leave me with this sob story of how aggressive I am and pressure him, and yell at him. It caused a bit of drama, but I'd do it again because I knew exactly how she operated.\n\nPeople who try to use the people we love have no right to be treated with dignity or respect. People who try to use the agreeableness of someone else to make their own lives more convenient deserve neither convenience nor rest. Your brother is blessed to have you, and you are certainly NTA.", "What you did wasn't rude, it was standing up for yourself and, more importantly, your brother.\n\nIf your aunt thinks that adults in their twenties are not mature enough to look after a kid, what is she doing asking a teenager to look after one (albeit a mature teenager)?\n\nNTA and I hope you enjoyed your movie night.", "Never keep a secret for an adult (as a general rule).

Good do the same thing next time. And those older cousins are talking as if that kid is Max's responsibility", "NTA your aunt is way out of line.\n\nTell Max that he should charge her. \u201cIt\u2019s a stating rate of 100$ an hour because apparently the kid is so demanding that nobody else is qualified, and since Max is qualified he must be worth the prize for you to foist your parental responsibilities onto him.\u201d", "NTA, and lol, great response.\n\nWhat the hell is up with all the parents in these AITAs lately trying to like\u2026 shoplift free babysitting?!
