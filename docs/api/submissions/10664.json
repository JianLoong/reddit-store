We\u2019re pretty close but that\u2019s because we went through something when we were younger and well I\u2019m sure you all know what bad experiences do to people.\n\nIt definitely hit Max a lot harder and he went from this crazy, hyper kid to a more reserved and mature one. I didn\u2019t change much.\n\nAlso Max couldn\u2019t stand enclosed places or the dark so movie theatres used to suck for him. He really wanted to get over his fear though and when he was 13 he decided to take a girl to the movies. He panicked a couple days before so we both went to the movies together before his date to prepare him lol. It was hard but also really fun and it kind of became tradition.\n\nHe can go to the movies whenever now but we have this fixed date every year where we go to the local cinema and watch a random movie. It\u2019s loads of fun.\n\nAnyways, Max, despite being one of the younger couisns, is treated like the eldest. Like I said, he transformed into this crazy mature kid and our one aunt really only trusts him with her kid (Judy-9f). \n\nThe whole family is staying with us for a bit to celebrate my grandma\u2019s birthday and the days overlapped with our movie day. We still planned on going out regardless. The adults were also going out to dinner together but our adult cousins (early-mid twenties) were going to be home so we didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nWell right as we were about to leave, Judy\u2019s mom asked where we were going. Max told her. She asked if we could take Judy along. He apologized and said that the movie isn\u2019t appropriate for little kids. She kept begging though and said that the others aren\u2019t mature enough. I noticed Max about to crack so I butted in and said \u201cthat sounds like a you problem\u201d before taking Max\u2019s hand and pulling him out the door. \n\nMax was all like wtf but got in the car anyways and we had a great time. \n\nWhen we got back, our cousins were PISSED. They started yelling at Max for suddenly changing his mind about being Judy\u2019s main babysitter and dumping her on them. When my aunt came home she was ignoring Max completely but was furious at me. She kept making sarcastic remarks about how rude and disrespectful I am and only stopped after my dad asked her what was going on. \n\nI feel really weird now. I know what I did was rude but I know Max, he finds it hard to say no. I just wanted to do one thing for him but it feels like I\u2019ve just pissed everyone off and made things hella awkward for Max. I just don\u2019t like how my aunt (+everyone else) takes advantage of Max and what happened to him.

Not even a little bit. They were trying to use your brother and you stopped them.\n\nYour aunt knows that what she wanted to do was wrong. Tell another adult what's going on. Don't cover for her and don't feel guilt over something she did.\n\nNtA", "NTA they are using him and mad you upheld a boundary in a very curt way. Screw them.", "No it really is a her problem they may feel hurt but  that's only because they got used to taking advantage of max. NTA", "NTA - Max is not the designated babysitter. Being \u201cthe mature one\u201d after trauma sucks (been there), because on top of the trauma, you get parentified. He deserves time to himself, to spend time with whoever he wants, especially since this is a yearly tradition. She was wrong for assuming he\u2019d do whatever she wanted and for trying to pressure him.", "INFO; \n\nWhat do your parents have to say about this?\n\nAre they upset Max didn't babysit too? If so they really should stand up for their son instead of the aunt, and the other adult cousins.\n\nthey know his issues. And besides your aunt didn't ask, she just assumed, and then when she tried to plead with him, because she couldn't trust others that made it worse. She was basically trying to guilt him into doing something he didn't want to do.\n\nYour parents need to stand up for him, and tell them all if they don't like it, then leave. And tell the aunt her child is her responsibility.\n\nIf they are on Max's side then why are they allowing them to treat him this way?", "NTA. Your aunt wasn\u2019t taking \u2018no\u2019 for an answer, so there was really no polite way to refuse her.", "NTA\n\nI don't recall reading anywhere that Max actually agreed to babysit. Your aunt shouldn't have assumed she can dump her kid on you and go out for dinner. The fact that she went to dinner with family is irrelevant.", "So, Max has trauma and your family has decided to use the \u201cgrew up too fast\u201d to take advantage? Usually people would want Max to be able to relax and be a kid. Discourage growing up too soon and help him find the ability again. \n\nALSO \nWhat kind of 9 year old can\u2019t be watched over by people in their 20\u2019s? 9 year olds are easy AF? They literally entertain themselves and are old enough not to die doing something dumb like a toddler. \n\nAnyway, of course NTA. \n\nPeople hate boundaries. They do. This is just everyone\u2019s reaction to not getting their own way.", "NTA. It is your aunt's child and 100% HER responsibility not your brothers. There were other adults there and you already this preplanned. While I hope it was a plan that was communicated to everyone before hand, like your aunt, even if it wasn't her reaction and reactions of others are completely disproportionate to the miscommunication that happened. Your brother is not the child's father so there's no obligation to act like one and watch her all the time. Your family needs to get off their high horse and thank you for standing up for him you should be proud of yourself and even if it's awkward now your brother will always cherish the tradition you got to uphold and fought for.", "NTA. Max was being taken advantage of.  People are generally mad when healthy boundaries are enforced that prevent them from taking advantage of someone.", "Nta and tell your parents.  They should know your aunt is treating you rudely for not wanting to watch your cousin", "NTA\nThey were taking advantage of Max. Your aunt should have checked beforehand if he was free to babysit and not just assume that he'll do it.", "YTA for creating a problem for max when you butted in. He should handle his own issues. He does not need you making things worse for him. You owe him an apology for not allowing him to handle the situation himself.", "The older cousins are pissed because you and Max didn't babysit Judy and they had to. \n\nYour aunt is pissed because she was told no, and she had to find alternate care for her daughter. \n\nBecause you did something FOR Max instead of expecting something FROM him, they are all pissed at you. \n\nNo, you are NTA. Not at all.", "NTA. Max never agreed to be the babysitter.  It should not have been assumed by your aunt that he would.  She wanted to trample his boundary.  Your cousins displaced their frustration with your aunt onto Max.", "NTA if there was no agreement for him to babysit then she shouldn't just expect it she is able to rely on your other cousins who possibly have nothing to do", "Oh they might as well promote your brother to personal maid. Your aunt forgets she has a daughter or what? Tell your cousins they are old enough to take care of judy and your aunt to start acting as mother and how dare she tell your brother what to do? She clearly exploits the situation. NTA and you said too little to all of them, they all should learn their spot.", "NTA, unless he promised he'd babysit at that time. They're taking advantage of his kindness, but instead of standing up for him you should encourage him to stand up for himself. You standing up for him won't help him long term.", "It doesn't matter he's a pushover. Pushovers can learn to say no AND mean it.\n\nInfo, please\n\nYour cousins are mad because he was supposed to be the main babysitter. Did anyone ask or tell your brother about him babysitting?", "NTA\n\n That was your aunt's problem indeed. \n\n>They started yelling at Max for suddenly changing his mind about being Judy\u2019s main babysitter and dumping her on them.\n\n If they didn't want to deal with someone else's kid, why would they expect that from your brother? And why don't they take it up with the parent who dumped her brat on them??", "NTA.  I actually chuckled at how you phrased it.  I would let him make the decisions for himself but I can't say I wouldn't do the same thing for one of my siblings.", "NTA. Your aunt wasn\u2019t taking \u2018no\u2019 for an answer, so there was really no polite way to refuse her.", "INFO: Had Max agreed to watching Judy that night or did your aunt make the assumption he would because he had in the past?", "I feel like I should tell our parents and maybe even my other aunts and uncles but Max made me promise not to tell anyone. I\u2019m not really covering for her, it\u2019s Max that I\u2019m \u201ccovering\u201d for.", "They don\u2019t know what happened. They\u2019ve noticed some tension but if they push it they\u2019re afraid Max might blow up on them (it\u2019s happened before, my dad and Max\u2019s relationship  completely deteriorated at one point). They asked me if something was wrong but Max made me promise not to tell.", "Your aunt just didn't want to be a parent for a day and was trying to palm the kid off on you and Max.", "Ugh I know but he always tells me that \u201che\u2019s handling it.\u201d He usually gets mad at me when I tell him he\u2019s allowed to say no so I was honestly a little surprised that he didn\u2019t say anything this time. \n\nBut the way my aunt and cousins are treating him is really taking a toll on him. Idk if he\u2019ll ever say no now.", "They were being sarcastic and sort of mocking him by calling him the main babysitter. There\u2019s no like official agreement or anything but everyone knows that he watches her often.", "There was no agreement.", "I would try to reassure him that having boundaries is ok and saying no is normal, look at your family they say no all the time. He is worth people caring for him as much as he cares for them. He sounds like an amazing brother and I hope you let him know even perfect strangers are rooting for him and are going through the same problem with saying no he is but remember his needs are just as important as the people asking him.", "Maybe it's just hard for him to see everything objectively because he's living it. Maybe try calculating how many hours a week he babysits for free, convert that into hours per your and how much money he could be making, or spending the time studying, etc. My brother's a pushover and sometimes he just doesn't understand how much others ask of him. Seeing the cold facts usually help my brother, and I hope it will help yours too. Good luck! \n\nLet me know if it works :)", "Then they need for him to help them manage their expectations & tell them no. And stick to it.\n\nOr flip 'em off & walk out.", "Why can't he make a decision for himself?", "**NTA** at all. Your aunt 100% deserved what she got for imposing on Max and making assumptions that way. It's good he at least has you on his side."]}
