Amy can go out with anyone she wants, no issue. She agreed to this. \n\nThrowaway. Ages, I'm 30, my husband 34 and Amy 22.\n\nOur niece 'Amy' (my husband's half brother's daughter) stayed at our home recently for almost 2 weeks. Amy had exam season at college, her school is a bit of a drive from where she lives and she'd be losing a lot of studying time going back and forth, so she asked if she could stay with us as we're nearby. She didn't pay any type of rent but did reimburse the increase in utilities. (she offered to pay for utilities by the way, we didn't ask her to)\n\nWe agreed because this was for an educational purpose, and I made it very clear to her she couldn't be using this time for socializing, mingling with friends and so on. Amy agreed to everything.\n\nLast week I came home from work and saw Amy's husband in the kitchen. He'd come with a report she left at home. I asked her what was going on, she said she made him coffee since he made the trip and 'he's only here for 30 minutes'. I reminded Amy we allowed her to stay here to make her studies easier, not so she can be bringing men over. I've also discussed this with her beforehand and she agreed, but now she's going against it.\n\nAmy started acting snarky so I replied she needs to respect other people's house and rules, otherwise she can leave.\n\nShe got upset and was quiet the rest of the time, but she did end up leaving a few days early.\n\nMy husband said Amy should've respected the rules but I was too harsh on her. I did text her later, but she didn't reply and she didn't pick up my husband's calls either. He did talk to his half brother and they were pissed off, but I also told a couple of my family members about it and they think I'm fine.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671116216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmn240/aita_telling_my_niece_she_can_leave_after_she/", "score": 10448, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And she's not living in your house for free...she may not be paying \"rent\" but she is paying for the increase in utilities.  So, you would be perfectly fine if you went to stay at someone else's house and they had a rule that you couldn't spend time with your husband for the whole time you're there?? You are so unbelievable unreasonable.  If I were Amy, I would leave and not speak to you again.", "YTA. Her HUSBAND isn\u2019t \u201cbringing men over\u201d.

It's not like she was having a party in your living room.

Ages, I'm 30, my husband 34 and Amy 22.\n\nOur niece 'Amy' (my husband's half brother's daughter) stayed at our home recently for almost 2 weeks. Amy had exam season at college, her school is a bit of a drive from where she lives and she'd be losing a lot of studying time going back and forth, so she asked if she could stay with us as we're nearby. She didn't pay any type of rent but did reimburse the increase in utilities. \n\nWe agreed because this was for an educational purpose, and I made it very clear to her she couldn't be using this time for socializing, mingling with friends and so on. Amy agreed to everything.\n\nLast week I came home from work and saw Amy's husband in the kitchen. She did tell me he'd be coming with a report she left at home, but I assumed he'd drop it off and leave. I asked her what was going on, she said she made him coffee since he made the trip and 'he's only here for 30 minutes'. I reminded Amy we allowed her to stay here to make her studies easier, not so she can be bringing men over. I've also discussed this with her beforehand and she agreed, but now she's going against it.\n\nAmy started acting snarky so I replied she needs to respect other people's house and rules, otherwise she can leave.\n\nShe got upset and was quiet the rest of the time, but she did end up leaving a few days early.\n\nMy husband said Amy should've respected the rules but I was too harsh on her. I did text her later, but she didn't reply and she didn't pick up my husband's calls either.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[removed]", ">He'd come with a report she left at home.

She didn't bring some random man into your house, her husband came by to bring her a report she needed, so she took a coffee break with him - things millions of reasonable people do all the time. \n\nIf that was against your rules, then your rules are insane.

You are acting like she was having random men over nightly to hook up and do drugs instead of study, when in reality her HUSBAND brought her something she needed and visited for less than an hour. Her HUSBAND, who is also therefore your family, her family, and is not just socializing...also, even if it is finals week(s), the girl still deserves to have some socialization and a break from studying to see her HUSBAND? Sure, if you really didn't want anyone in your home, I get that, and I see how it would be bothersome for her to bring someone in without telling you, but that person was (AGAIN) her HUSBAND.
