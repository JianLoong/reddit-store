Amy can go out with anyone she wants, no issue. She agreed to this. \n\nThrowaway. Ages, I'm 30, my husband 34 and Amy 22.\n\nOur niece 'Amy' (my husband's half brother's daughter) stayed at our home recently for almost 2 weeks. Amy had exam season at college, her school is a bit of a drive from where she lives and she'd be losing a lot of studying time going back and forth, so she asked if she could stay with us as we're nearby. She didn't pay any type of rent but did reimburse the increase in utilities. (she offered to pay for utilities by the way, we didn't ask her to)\n\nWe agreed because this was for an educational purpose, and I made it very clear to her she couldn't be using this time for socializing, mingling with friends and so on. Amy agreed to everything.\n\nLast week I came home from work and saw Amy's husband in the kitchen. He'd come with a report she left at home. I asked her what was going on, she said she made him coffee since he made the trip and 'he's only here for 30 minutes'. I reminded Amy we allowed her to stay here to make her studies easier, not so she can be bringing men over. I've also discussed this with her beforehand and she agreed, but now she's going against it.\n\nAmy started acting snarky so I replied she needs to respect other people's house and rules, otherwise she can leave.\n\nShe got upset and was quiet the rest of the time, but she did end up leaving a few days early.\n\nMy husband said Amy should've respected the rules but I was too harsh on her. I did text her later, but she didn't reply and she didn't pick up my husband's calls either. He did talk to his half brother and they were pissed off, but I also told a couple of my family members about it and they think I'm fine.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671116216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmn240/aita_telling_my_niece_she_can_leave_after_she/", "score": 612, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So, you would be perfectly fine if you went to stay at someone else's house and they had a rule that you couldn't spend time with your husband for the whole time you're there??

Ages, I'm 30, my husband 34 and Amy 22.\n\nOur niece 'Amy' (my husband's half brother's daughter) stayed at our home recently for almost 2 weeks. Amy had exam season at college, her school is a bit of a drive from where she lives and she'd be losing a lot of studying time going back and forth, so she asked if she could stay with us as we're nearby. She didn't pay any type of rent but did reimburse the increase in utilities. \n\nWe agreed because this was for an educational purpose, and I made it very clear to her she couldn't be using this time for socializing, mingling with friends and so on. Amy agreed to everything.\n\nLast week I came home from work and saw Amy's husband in the kitchen. She did tell me he'd be coming with a report she left at home, but I assumed he'd drop it off and leave. I asked her what was going on, she said she made him coffee since he made the trip and 'he's only here for 30 minutes'. I reminded Amy we allowed her to stay here to make her studies easier, not so she can be bringing men over. I've also discussed this with her beforehand and she agreed, but now she's going against it.\n\nAmy started acting snarky so I replied she needs to respect other people's house and rules, otherwise she can leave.\n\nShe got upset and was quiet the rest of the time, but she did end up leaving a few days early.\n\nMy husband said Amy should've respected the rules but I was too harsh on her. I did text her later, but she didn't reply and she didn't pick up my husband's calls either.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[removed]", ">He'd come with a report she left at home.

She didn't bring some random man into your house, her husband came by to bring her a report she needed, so she took a coffee break with him - things millions of reasonable people do all the time. \n\nIf that was against your rules, then your rules are insane.

You are acting like she was having random men over nightly to hook up and do drugs instead of study, when in reality her HUSBAND brought her something she needed and visited for less than an hour. Her HUSBAND, who is also therefore your family, her family, and is not just socializing...also, even if it is finals week(s), the girl still deserves to have some socialization and a break from studying to see her HUSBAND? Sure, if you really didn't want anyone in your home, I get that, and I see how it would be bothersome for her to bring someone in without telling you, but that person was (AGAIN) her HUSBAND.

Am I missing something??", "Yta-she didn\u2019t invite strange men in. He came to drop something off and you know it\u2019s a long drive over so she made him coffee.

YTA.", "YTA - This was not a random individual, you I am presuming, KNEW the husband.  It was her husband, not some guy off the street.

If so, I hope you don't have the audacity to bring your husband, because that would be quite hypocritical. \n\nShe did not invite a stranger to have sex in your bedroom, she offered her husband a cup of coffee after he took the road to bring her materials she needs to complete her session.

Because OP definitely implied she's bringing a bunch of guys over while living away from her husband", "Me too, I think I read it three times with my jaw agape. YTA OP. I just can\u2019t fathom what you wrote. Are you like this in every aspect of your life? It do you take some glee in really tightening the screws on your already stressed niece? You really need to evaluate your behaviour, empathy and kindness. If this is normal for you, yikes.", "Same, I read it twice as well. Insanity.  She made her husband a cup of coffee, and I imagine they were just standing there chatting when she came in? Not having a huge party?", "Exactly\u2026 YTA, op. And a looney. Having family (even if it\u2019s his *half* brother\u2019s daughter, thanks for clearing that up /s) over for 2 weeks during exams and paying utilities?

Of course, if you like being solitary that's also totally fine.)   \n\n\nBut this is a whole new level, she's apparently married and you call it 'men over'?! What the actual f.

OP i was expecting you to say she had some friends over or met someone at a bar and brought them back.

How about you go to someone else's house and not be allowed to see YOUR HUSBAND for 2 weeks, pay their utilities, then be treated like a lady of the evening if your husband DARES come see you!!", "Absolutely!

I had to re-read the word HUSBAND about 5 times, my brain would not compute!", "Yes my thoughts exactly. Wtf. Yta", "Totally! I was already a bit put off by the request for utilities. But the over the top reaction to the niece's husband staying for a cup of coffee ? I guess they should have met at the curb. OP doesn't have to worry about anymore visits from that side of the family. I would only do zoom visits. OP, you are weird AF and also YTA.", "OP left that part out. This is not a random man or MEN as she put it. I bet OP\u2019s husband has to ask if he can go out and play with the other boys in the neighborhood.

I won't answer your phone either.", "I think OP thought she was going to be the strict parent who ensured niece would never be distracted and probably believes she thought she was doing this for niece's own good.
