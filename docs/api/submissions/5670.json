She knew if she bought it that she would have to store it and maintain it. She decided to push your boundaries on the toy. Fully a fuck around and find out situation. Hold your ground.

She chose to override you, and that has the potential to create disciplinary issues later on, if not nipped in the bud.  You are his mother.
