End of discussion.", "NTA\n\nYou told her not to buy it, you told her what would happen if she did.  She can keep it at her house.

Maybe next year she'll listen.", "Is there no way to return it for cash?\n\nNTA.  Your mom should follow your instructions on such matters.", "NTA. She knew your boundary. She knew if she bought it that she would have to store it and maintain it. She decided to push your boundaries on the toy. Fully a fuck around and find out situation. Hold your ground. If she brings it over herself, put it up on Buy Nothing or whatever marketplace you like for immediate porch pickup.", "NTA. I can sympathise.", "No way are you at fault NTA I had to take this stance with my mom too. Giant stuffed animals started making our house look like a taxidermy museum. Once I stood my ground about nothing bigger than a milk crate is allowed to come home, the rest stays at her house, she stopped buying it.", "NTA - you warned her.  She chose to override you, and that has the potential to create disciplinary issues later on, if not nipped in the bud.  You are his mother. She is not.", "NTA\n\nYou made your position clear, she bought it anyway.   Now she gets to enjoy the consequences of her actions.", "NTA", "NTA any chance you can return it and use the money for another present or save it for your son?", "Nta on the fence about it though because you can\u2019t tell people what they can and can\u2019t do just whether as their parent you accept it I understand the frustration because no room and he\u2019s not into it I just wouldn\u2019t of worded it like that in the post or to her", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You gave more than fair warning so either she's dumb as hell or she doesn't respect you. We know which one it is, dont we?

I asked my step son and DIL what their son would like for Christmas.  He's 3 and he's into dinosaurs and Hot Wheels. So I sent my SS a link to the HW garage with a dinosaur in it. They thought it'd be great!\n\nI had it shipped to them in TX, and GS played with it all day! He loves it!\n\nI took the parents advice and confirmed with them BEFORE I bought it. I always check with my all my kids before I buy Christmas or birthday gifts for my grandkids. \n\nIt makes me a fun grandparent that is trusted by the parents!", "NTA.  You were very clear with her and she ignored you.  If she brings the toy to your house just donate it.", "Absolutely NTA. She mustered up the courtesy to give you a heads up about the toy rather than ask (which ought to be standard with gifts for kiddos like this) and you responded with no and laid out both your boundaries and your reasons for them. She had no right to be mad about an agreement she literally signed on to by knowing your terms and buying the toy anyway, especially given the nature of the toy, your living situation, and the fact you've got a toddler running around in a house that's already flush with toys. The last thing you need is extra clutter and stress! And certainly not to be antagonized by Grandma (who sounds like a challenge on a good day, has she always been like this?)\n\nAnyway you are in the right, so hold your ground. She can moan all she wants about the eyesore \"gift\" she wanted credit, but not responsibility, for.\n\n(Sidenote: It may be time to start moving out old toys, if not to make room for new ones he'll like more then at least to create a bit more space in your home. At that age he isn't going to remember them save a few special toys so if you've got the time and energy maybe you can find somewhere to donate/sell them!)", "I used to warn my family not to buy anything at all for me - never mind anything heavy or bulky - as I had a long train journey with several changes, limited mobility and couldn't fit anything more in my backpack.\n\nGuess what? Big gifts still appeared, and were never taken back to London with me. That was still held against me for years, even though it wasn't physically possible to carry any more.\n\nNTA so many times.", "NTA", "NTA \nI had this issue too. You say away from your kid \"oh great! A bulldozer for grandmas house when kid visits? It's not staying here, as we talked about, so assume this is a fun toy for your house. I'll help you load it back in your car\"\nThen tell your mom it's either going to her house or bring donated. Then follow through. \n\n I had a similar issue, followed through - no more huge toys when I say no. I do still get a snarky comment here and there about the toy or any other big toy I decide to get my child. I don't care anymore. My house, my rules.", "NTA \n\nYou told her beforehand that there isn't room at your house and that your son doesn't play much with those kinds of toys.", "Well guess what, you have a nice donation for the Goodwill.", "As a parent who struggles with Grandparents who can\u2019t help themselves and buy way too much shit, NTA.", "Yes!  We removed literally boxes of this stuff from our kid's room and told MIL that we finally had free space to move around in her room.  Less than 48 hours later, they took her on a shopping spree and returned with six replacement stuffed animals."]}
