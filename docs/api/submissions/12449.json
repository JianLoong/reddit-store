The buyer came to my house where I offered to let him test it, but he declined. He was excited to buy the amp because he'd been looking for that model, and I was happy to sell it to him because of how excited he was. \n\nIn February 2023, 14 months after I sold him the amp, the buyer contacted me with this message:\n\n>Hello ----, you sold me an amplifier that does not work for $350. I\u2019m requesting $100 dollars of my money back due to extensive repair bills. I trusted you and did not test the amp when I picked up. The electronics tech has said that there is no way it was possibly in working order(due to internal missing parts)when I purchased. I\u2019m paying an additional $300 to get it in working order. I feel like this is a reasonable resolve.\n\nI responded that the amp was working when I sold it to him and that I would have refunded his money had he let me know it wasn't working at the time. When I asked why he was just now asking for a refund after over a year, his response was \"I never used it.\" After some back and forth he finally said he was going to report me and review me, and I told him to do that if that's what gives him closure. He went on to tell me that his suggestion \"was a reasonable suggestion. Clearly you\u2019re not a reasonable guy. I\u2019m sure it will come back your way.\" He did indeed leave me a 1-star review on FB Marketplace to which I have not yet responded.\n\nI feel bad for him that he has a broken amp, but I have no way of knowing what happened to the amp in the 14 months since I sold it or the legitimacy of his amp tech. I understand requesting a refund for a short amount of time after a purchase even if there isn't an explicitly agreed-upon guarantee, but after over a year it seems reasonable for me to decline a refund.

It\u2019s Facebook marketplace, you\u2019re not a retailer. Items are bought on a caveat emptor basis ie buyer beware. He had the chance to test it both at your home and right after purchase.

If so I would.", "NTA. \n\nI'm sure the amp is fine and they're being scammy mcscamster.", "NTA It's been over a year ago. You have no idea how the amp was treated during that time. For all you know the guy probably threw it down the stairs.", "NTA. 14 months out sorry no refund. Time enough to be used and abused.", "NTA. Seems like he's trying to scam you. Nobody legit is going to buy an amp and sit on it for a year.", "Nta.

You know you are assuming risk when buying second hand items. It\u2019s upto you to due diligence properly", "I pickup cheap and free speakers, radios, and amps all the time, fix them, and then resell them. I have stopped letting people opt not to check them because this shit happens so often. I give them a demonstration myself when they show up, non-negotiable. When I say \"okay, so bring them back and I'll have a look, no cost\" they almost never do. Because they know I'm going to notice the physical damage they have done to the units. I have photos of every unit I sell from every angle. Dents to the boxes that indicate dropping, sagging in the fabric covers because they put something heavy on top of it, scorch marks from power surges. Once, a guy thought I wouldnt notice half of a literal arrow sticking out of a speaker cone underneath the fabric cover, and when I pointed it out he said \"it was there when I got it\", and like no, I have my database entry for that item and I replaced both cones, so there was definitely not an arrow in it before. I don't do refunds. Occasionally I will repair at cost, or for free if it's simple and people were nice to me/we connected.\n\n\n OP is NTA. Speakers and Amps are often more delicate than their exterior construction suggests, and in my experience, people regularly break them by mishandling. Fourteen months is way too long. If you put an item that was working fine in my house in your car and fourteen minutes later you want a refund, because it's suddenly not working, the answer is no. It really is on the buyer to make sure it works to their satisfaction before they leave with it, and to transport it carefully enough so as not to damage it.", "I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and consider him naive rather than malicious. I will respond to his review on FB, though.", "Retail stores in my area actually refer people with these kind of issues with speakers to me after the manufacturer warranty runs out: a chick with a side hustle fixing speakers locally. So you're dead right on that one. in the first year or so, they almost always go through the manufacturer for repairs, unless they're physically or liquid damaged, at which point everyone considers the damage an ID10T error, and local fixers are your only choice.", "I can rate him as a buyer, and I can also respond to his review. As far as any recourse where the marketplace would side with him, that time has all passed. Neither Facebook nor Venmo (how he paid me) would allow a dispute to be filed this long after the fact, probably for the same reasons I stated.", "Problem with a lot of these sites is that they often have a habit of siding with the buyer over the seller, sometimes to a fairly high degree, and with it they\u2019re hesitant or simply outright refuse to acknowledge seller\u2019s complaints.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You\u2019re supposed to be a fellow musician. Just kind of uncool thing to do to somebody.\u201d", "The last message I sent him was that I think we both learned a lesson about not testing gear at the moment of purchase. I definitely won\u2019t make that mistake again.", "I have so done it, lol. Just let someone take stuff because they didn't want to waste the time checking it, and I couldn't be bothered to potentially lose the sale by arguing with them. We live and we learn, bud. We live and we learn.", "HAHAHAHAHA.\n\nNo.", "NTA. Definitely sounds like he was trying to run you for some money. What\u2019s funny is if he say, tried to sue you, you have a text message proof where he outed himself on buying it without testing it. That\u2019s on him. I suppose if you want to be extra safe going forward you could make it a policy to always demonstrate the item works and that you will not sell it without that demonstration but honestly I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve matter here. He would\u2019ve found another reason like a clearly faulty part that was ready to go at any minute when you sold it to him or something.", "NTA\n\nThe responsibility for this one lies completely with him.\n\nAnything bought used is bought at the buyer's risk. It is up to them to do the appropriate checks and testing before they hand over the money. As soon as it is out of your hands you no longer have any knowledge of how that item is being treated, or whether the fault they are claiming is genuine, a problem they have caused, or an attempt to scam you. \n\nStores may offer refund guarantees and warranties, but they also have the benefit of larger sales volumes to absorb some losses, manufacturer support and higher selling prices and profit margins. \n\nIn this case his request is even more idiotic. If he had tested it when he got home and found a problem then some could argue for consideration, but leaving it for over a year is absurd and just complete laziness and irresponsibility on his part.", "NTA. I had something like this happen on eBay. Very rare, and very nice, vintage microphone. Last serviced in the 80's or 90's by manufacturer. \n\nBuyer was local (within 1 hour commute), but instead of opting for local pickup or to test the mic he just wanted it shipped. I offered to let him test it bc I didn't have the equipment to do so (mic was a gift from my grandfather). I knew it was registering sound input when plugged in bc taking into it made the gauge move appropriately on what I did have. I had listed it \"as-is\" and priced it lower than the recently sold listings. I was upfront about EVERYTHING. Plus, whatever could possibly be wrong with it could still be repaired.\n\nI took photos of it being packed, after packing, etc. I asked him repeatedly if he was sure. During this he'd also offered to pay for it via PayPal outside of eBay (said using ebay's messaging system) which is a ToS violation... But he eventually paid via eBay so I was happy.\n\nDays after he gets it, complaints. Wanted his money back, to keep the mic, etc. I submitted the photos, message logs (including his ToS violating offer), and my statement for my side of the story.\n\nEBay sided with me. Felt like an asshole, but I was using it to pay rent during COVID lockdown so I lived with myself lol.", "I collect pinball machines. There are lie a million different ways they can break or not work. You buy a pinball machine and you get it home and it doesn't work that is your problem. This is the accepted way of things.

And today I learned folks can leave reviews 14 months AFTER purchase so I am glad I use eBay instead.", "NTA no music equipment business would take a return after 14 months.\n\nAs long as it truly worked when you sold it to him, this is 100% not your problem.", "NTA.

Even brick and mortal stores have a return policy.", "He \"requested\" $100, huh?\n\nTell him to \"request\" in one hand and sh\\*t in the other and see which one fills up faster.  \n\nThen send him an invoice for $100 million for wasting your valuable time.", "NTA obviously he broke it and is trying to get you to pay for it.", "Umm, he broke the amp, he tried to repair it and couldn't so just left those parts off and took it to the shop and played dumb.  NTA, report him to FB if you can to save other sellers from this person.", "I think it's more likely that this person is just really stupid and entitled, they think they can get a refund like they would if they nagged a manager at Best Buy", "Nah, that's malicious dude.
