You made your mess and your procrastination somebody else's problem and jumped on a bus with a sorry and a text. You won't get a response to that text, and you most likely have one less friend.", "YTA - poor planning on your part caused you to leave a mess - where you were a GUEST!\n\nI suspect that you do this type of thing in other areas in your life so you should get used to having ex-friends. \n\nLearn to do better.", "YTA - it's basic courtesy if you're cooking in someone else's kitchen to completely clean after yourself. Having poor time management is **not** an excuse and shows a disregard for other people's possessions.", "YTA, mainly because of poor communication. When you realised you were late, you should have explained immediately. \n\nIt also wasn\u2019t great to volunteer her for cleaning when her housemate asked. \n\nCould you have skipped breakfast or even eaten it on the run so you could tidy up? (In my house, when one of us cooks, the other tidies up, but this needs to be agreed beforehand.)", "YTA.  You should have either set yourself more time to clean, or else had a simple breakfast.  Next time, don't be an AH and leave a huge mess for someone.", "YTA and playing the victim. She let you stay overnight and you childishly did not manage your time well, thus resulting in more work for her. You will be the friend she talks about for taking advantage of her hospitality and she will be right.", "You are a gigantic AH. Who are you to tell others what they should or shouldn\u2019t be upset at? It\u2019s their place. Their kitchen. You were being given a favor.

Your friend can take care of a little mess.\n\nP.S. I would never make my friend clean up (or cook for that matter) if they were only staying the night and had to leave early in the morning. They are my guest sheesh, how about being a decent host. Also if I were the roommate I'd just calmly request that she clean up the mess her guest made. This is just bonkers. It's just some plates and shit calm down.\n\nEdit: Based on the other replies, there seems to be a cultural difference. If my mum found out I haven't offered breakfast to a friend who stayed at my place and made them clean up the kitchen I would never hear the end of it lol", "Yes, YTA.  Don't hide behind the excuse that time management is not one of your better skills.  You made the mess, therefore it's your responsibility to clean it up.  If that means you should have gotten up earlier than you did, so be it.  Accept that what you did was pretty crappy and apologize profusely to your friend.", "It's not courteous and in poor taste to leave a mess in someone else's house. I would personally not let you stay again. YTA.", "YTA. Work on your time management skills instead of using them as an excuse for bad behavior.", "YTA. You made the mess; clean it up. You have poor time management skills is in no way an excuse.", "I see a lot of comments telling me AITA, I can see why, clearly. One post asked why I would even ask this,that'd be in my culture it's quite different, where the host itself would be the courteous one, and being in foreign country I don't expect this. However, if someone stays in my place or asks for such favor, I wouldn't be mad about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your lack of planning doesn't make cleaning up someone else's responsibility. It doesn't matter if it was one plate or a sink full; that's irrelevant. This friend let you stay at her home for the night, doing you a favor, and you leave the kitchen a mess? And then you volunteer her to clean up after you without Really asking her if getting her agreement? Really? Can't believe you have to ask if you're the asshole", "YTA. You lack time management skills but it is still a jerk thing to do. You\u2019re an adult. You need to be responsible for your actions. You also need to know your limitations. If you suck at time management and you are staying somewhere...get granola bars to eat for breakfast or something you can eat on the go. That way there wouldn\u2019t have been a mess and you wouldn\u2019t have had to worry if you ate before you left or not. With that said accidents do happen. Friend should have had a bit of consideration...unless you do things like this regularly. They opened their home to you. You made a mess and ran out the door with a sorry.", "YTA. You made a massive mess and didn\u2019t clean it up. It was your choice to \u2018need\u2019 a huge breakfast before you left when you could\u2019ve just eaten a quick bowl of cereal or something quick. Your poor time management is not anyone else\u2019s problem. If you know you have poor time management, do something about it, especially when it\u2019s going to affect other people.", "You can't be serious. YES YTA. You made your bad time management skills someone else's problem. It was extremely self-centered of you", "YTA.  You could have cleaned up as you went along, ensuring that if anything was left, it could have been done quickly.", "YTA. You need to learn time management. Are you gonna ask your boss to finish your work because you have to leave ?", "No judgements here for lack of INFO but the \"ex-friend\" comment has me concerned, I wouldn't have friends that couldn't move past a small issue like this. They could be upset with me for doing something like that or I could be upset with them for doing it but it wouldn't end a friendship", "YTA. It's not the end of the world but you need to learn some time management skills. You can't always use that excuse when leaving areas messy for someone else to clean up.", "YTA your 23 not 3, you dumped your mess on your friend and her roommate and most of us learned to tell time by age 6.  All you offer are pathetic excuses, like you think it is ok.  Sorry it isn't.", "Yes YTA. Poor time management skills need n your part should not be a problem for your host or their roommate. You know that you have problems in this area. You should have allotted more time than you thought you would need for food prep, eating, and clean up or just picked something up to eat while you travelled.", "YTA, of course. \n\n* It was your friend who did you a favor by letting you spend the night at her place. \n* It was your decision to make a heavy breakfast when you had to leave in the early morning.\n* It was you who \"lost track of time\" when everything was only half-cooked, and left a huge mess for your friend and her housemate to deal with.\n\nWhyever would you think you were *not* the asshole?", "YTA. You can't leave your mess for someone to clean up citing your time management skills.  It would have been best for you to not have cooked.  Put yourself,in their shoes.  You wouldn't be happy if they made a mess and left with no viable explanation other than sorry.

But I didn't think it was wrong to ask my friend back then, but everyone has different opinions and also,it could be the cultural difference....", "Certainly, lesson learnt", "It is indeed cultural difference, I believe. I don't expect the same kind of courtesy we give,but I thought friends do help in such situations.", "but you weren't a GUEST - she was doing you a favor.  I think this changes this cultural issue of HOST needing to feed the GUEST.", "That's true! I agree", "but, but, but OP always has heavy breakfast and who cares that friend's roommate is a neat freak - actually, shame on roommate for being that way! /s", "she did you a favor and you repaid that by making a mess for her to clean up. \n\nDoes she need a friend that gives her more work?", "Well from your perspective it's rude for your friend to not offer you breakfast or at least offer to clean up after *you* cooked *her* breakfast as a guest, I'm guessing. These things happen, it's nothing to end a friendship over. Just call it a mishap and move on.", "The food wasn't half cooked,infact it was all done for both of us. I asked in this community because i can't make sense of the matter is that serious to end the friendship.", "\"...i can't make sense of the matter is that serious to end the friendship...\"\n\nIt's my guess that this incident might be the last one in a string of difficult incidents that your friend has had to tolerate. \n\nIf you normally tend to behave in a hasty or disorganized way, your friend may have put up with a lot from you over time. The friend may have never said anything in the past because they realize you don't deliberately intend to inconvenience or hurt them ... it's just the way you are. \n\nThis last incident may be simply the \"last straw\" that caused your friend to be openly annoyed with you rather than put up with your behavior.\n\nThis is just a guess -- it's impossible for me to know if this is actually the case. If you don't have good personal insight about yourself and your behavior, only your friend will be able to explain.", ">almost half way through food preparation for both- me and my friend,I realized I'm quite very late for my coach\n\nSorry, this statement made me think that you didn't finish cooking. \n\nIt's irrelevant to the judgment, however. You're still the asshole. \n\nIf your actual question is whether your ass-holiness was serious enough to end a friendship over, that's a violation of Rule 7."]}
