They kept going on and on, making jokes about getting drunk on the flight or taping the kids' mouths shut.\n\nI got kind of sick of hearing about it and every conversation topic circled back to the vacation flight one way or another. It was a bit petty, I jokingly told them if they hate flying with their kids so much they don't have to go on vacation.\n\nMy brother really didn't like that, and accused me of saying that parents don't deserve vacations. He said I don't get it and that I'll understand when I have kids, and told me I'm being disrespectful.\n\nHis wife started chiming in and accused me of mom shaming, and said that if I don't want to hear them complain I should babysit the kids for free, and said that while I'm at it I should do housework for them.\n\nI told them they're being weird and that I was just pointing out that going on vacation isn't a necessity if they really dread flying with their kids so much, considering how much they've been complaining about it. My brother's wife called me a judgemental, heartless idiot, and said that I have an iq of -30. I just calmly said \"that's not very nice\" and she went silent for a few minutes. We talked about other stuff for the rest of the dinner, but my brother and his wife were very off around me.\n\nI seriously don't see the big deal in what I said, I don't think I said anything unkind.

For ages 0-2 years old, you don't need to buy a plane ticket for them as they can be lapsitters.  The way your SIL jumped right into saying you should be babysitting them for free, shows me she feels entitled to childcare from family but also FREE CHILD CARE!\n\n\nWHY would parents of a 2 year old and 5 month old take them on a 20 hour flight?  There are no closer vacation spots?  \n\n\nThey are just mad that you called them out, and NO ONE OFFERED.\n\n\nTell them to clean their own house and take care of their own kids.", "NTA, why fly for 20 hours if it\u2019s such an issue it has to dominate the conversation. Seems to me they were bragging about their trip.", "NTA, they wanted a pity party and for everyone to commiserate with them.  Instead they just came off as annoying.  \n\nI say this as a parent who has traveled with kids under two, I never complained, I just put on my big girl pants and did what I could to keep them entertained and minimally disruptive as possible.  Course, I never took a 20 hour flight with a child.  Unless it is to see family, those are vacations I'd take once the kids are over 5yo at least.", "NTA. You made a valid point. If it's so horrendous to fly with the kids don't take vacations which require flying. Do something else locally. They're probably those people who go overseas but have never been to any local museum.", "NTA- nobody wants to hear an unending string of complaints about.....going on vacation, it's like it's some sort of weird flex. For what it's worth, cuz it seems like this sort of conflict might come around in some way or another... keep this line handy... uh, yeah, I didn't say that and you don't get to put words in my mouth just so you can carry on with your made up narrative. Secondly- you don't get to call me disrespectful ever again after the slew of insults you guys put on me last time.", "NTA. I join the chorus of they were fishing for someone to step up and watch the kids while THEY went on vacation kid free.\n\nReasons\n\n\\-\"Don't parents deserve a vacation?\" Um its a family trip not just the two of them.\n\n\\-Your SIL bringing up watching them for free(HA) and doing chores.\n\n\\-This \"spontaneous\" trip in general. No one and I mean NO ONE with really young kids who aren't crazy rich and have a nanny just up and decide to go on a 20 hour flight with said kids for funsies. \n\nReality: They want you(but will settle for someone else if need be) to watch their kids for their very much planned trip and are mad you didn't get the subtle hint to offer to babysit and housesit for them.\n\nOne of a couple things will happen\n\n\\-They will suddenly decide to not go \n\n\\-They will realize they will have to pay someone to watch their kids and home & cave.\n\n\\-One of the kids will magically be not feeling well or some other bs excuse but they will get surprised dropped at someone's home while they go off on their couple's getaway. \n\n\\-They go with the kids and bitch and moan upon return about how they couldn't do anything adult funwise with the kids with them and how bad the flight was etc etc etc\n\nMy advice - the day of their flight? Be as far away from your place as possible. Doesn't matter if you still live with your parents or live on your own. Just be gone and generally unreachable for them. If you have roommates let them know that if Bro and SIL show up they are to say, \"OP already told us she wasn't babysitting if you leave your kids here the cops will be called\" and the close the door.", "NTA. Sounds like they were fishing for someone to volunteer to take their kids for a couple weeks while they had fun. They shoulda just asked someone.", "NTA. You were completely on point. And, I don't think I need to say this, because you seem to have a good head on your shoulders, but do not babysit or do anything for them for free.\n\nThere are plenty of places to go on vacation that don't require 20 hours of air travel, and they probably should have saved this trip for when the kids are older. They have probably realized this and want to turn you into the scapegoat instead of owning up to it themselves.", "NTA I have the same issue with my brother and SIL they have zero awareness about the stupidity of some of the stuff they complain about. They get angry if called on it as well.", "I have travelled extensively with my kids since they were little. Flying can definitely be a pain. Couldn't they just be venting? They cam still enjoy a vacation but dread the flying portion of it.\n\nThat being said, NTA, as I don't see your comment as being so strong to warrant such a mood ruining attitude from them", "NTA. Up to a point, sharing dreads and anxieties about something you voluntarily do as a parent is fine, but dominating conversation in a group setting is past that. Joking about inappropriate solutions is past that. Its obnoxious. I signed my kid up for a truly unpleasant series of events she is going to love. My dread is real. But if I need comfort and encouragement to do it, that isn't a dinner time group conversation. If I did that its the lowest form of attention seeking and humble bragging about how self sacrificing I am. Or how awful the privilege of flying and having two whole days to spend on travel alone is... so tone deaf and the top entry of the first world problems dictionary definition.", "NTA. They were embarrassed that you called them out essentially over their constant complaining, actually bragging, about their upcoming trip. Their reaction to your comment was pretty nasty.", "NTA.", "I just asked my husband if he would take a 2 year and a 5 month old on a 20 hour flight and he said \"I don't know if I'd take you in a 20 hour flight\".  In his defense I can be stressful to travel with but I digress. That is a lot to take on and they seem to be slightly dramatic about it. NTA for questioning their decision. Our son is 20 and is well traveled BTW so it's not like we don't have some experience here.", "NTA. I understand that you were irritated by their \u201ccomplaints\u201d because they were actually bragging about their trip. You admit to being petty. Of course you weren\u2019t saying parents don\u2019t deserve vacations, but most choose closer destinations. \n\nYour sister-in-law really escalated the whole argument. She made it personal with insults. My take is that she knows it\u2019s silly to put small children through the ordeal of traveling for such a long time without a great excuse and feels guilty. You, unintentionally, hit them where it hurt. So, while I don\u2019t think your saying something was the smartest move, it didn\u2019t justify the response you got.", "NTA. I\u2019m annoyed just hearing about it second hand.", "I'm kind of on the fence but I'm gonna say NTA.\n\nAnyone constantly circling a group conversation back to them complaining about the same thing over and over is extremely annoying, especially first-world-esque problems. \n\nYour comment was unnecessary but given the context, what response were they expecting?", "NTA. They don't have to fly if they really don't want to.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re being ridiculous. You were being logical, and they didn\u2019t want to hear it.", "NTA you were spot on. Sounds like they were hoping that the grandparents would save the day and watch the kids.", "NTA. They wanted someone to volunteer to keep the kids. When you called them out on their shit behavior they lashed out. \n\nYour sil may feel overwhelmed being a new mom of two. Your brother may not be the best husband/ father. Her comment about keeping the kids and doing housework sounds like a cry for help. \n\nDo not volunteer to keep the kids while they go on vacation. \n\nIf you feel like reaching out to her you could phrase it like concern. Ask if you could spend time with the children while she takes a break, walk, shopping, shower, salon, etc. If you're not comfortable babysitting alone you could get your mom on board and work out a plan to keep the kids occasionally.", "NTA\n\nYour brother and his wife are a bit crazy to take 2 kids so young in a 20 hours flight. The flight will be the nightmare they imagined, and more. \n\nOut of all the vacation destinations, they had to choose one so far away, and kids so young won't even enjoy the effort. \n\nAnyway, you spoke your mind, they got offended, but don't worry, during the 20 hours flight they will come back to your words many many times :))", "This was a ploy to secure some free childcare. NTA.", "NTA - I love Thanksgiving. It\u2019s the best reminder of why family doesn\u2019t get together more often lol. There\u2019s no good way to tell family to shut up and you don\u2019t care about how poorly behaved their kids are, so assuming you\u2019re telling the truth this is the best you could\u2019ve done", "NTA and I\u2019m surprised your brother allowed his wife to talk to you like that. You didn\u2019t insult them or cuss and the fact that she went straight to insults and saying you should basically be her slave for what you said is a major red flag. I hope nothing ever happens to your parents and you are never in a position to need their help because oh boy, I do not see it going to well for you!", ">His wife started chiming in and accused me of mom shaming, and said that if I don't want to hear them complain I should babysit the kids for free, and said that while I'm at it I should do housework for them.\n\nThis is why they were complaining... for someone to come in and rescue them. She says you are shaming her, but she is shaming you, and frankly, they are going to end up with no one around if they think they can whine and guilt people into free labor. \n\nWhy do you have to babysit the kids for free to see how hard it is? You can be paid and still see that it might be a challenge. They want free help... avoid them. NTA.", "They kept circling back to the conversation... that makes me wonder if they expected someone to say, \"Don't try to make that long trip with the kids.  Why don't you leave them with us and go by yourselves?\"\n\nNot only did they not get an offer if free babysitting, but they got called out on their complaints.  So to me, it sounds like they went off on you because you were the one who said the words out loud.\n\nI think you handled it beautifully.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nPeople who go on long flights like that with children they don't like deserve every bit of misery. People who go on long flights with young children in general deserve misery.", "NTA - Instead of complaining, maybe they could\u2019ve prepped them selves and their kids for a better flight they made some stuffed entertain their children obviously not all kids are perfect on a flight and they\u2019re bound to have meltdowns if they having fun with them before how can I already criticize their children?", "NTA. Sounds like they were either low key bragging about the vacation or looking for a cheap/free babysitter. They'll get over it.", "NTA!", "You're NTA. Their complaining was obviously just bragging in disguise and that gets very tiresome to hear over and over.", "NTA. If you ask me, they were trying to score some free babysitting, especially since your SIL jumped in to suggest exactly that!", "YTA. They were venting and joking. Unless you want to hear snide comments every time you talk longer on something than others want to hear, learn to nod, smile, and change topics.", "ESH.  You are all disrespectful to each other.  Sadly, that sounds like a lot of families at Thanksgiving dinner.  Just talk about the food, the parade, football, or funny memes instead.", "ESH. More so the brother and SIL, who needed to shut the hell up and discuss something else, and given their responses (esp the SIL), they might have been looking for criticism. But annoying, self-involved relatives are the norm at Thanksgiving meals. You just have to get through it, although eating and keeping your mouth shut are at odds.
