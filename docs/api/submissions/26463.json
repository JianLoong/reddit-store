I did ask about noise and the previous owners said there had been no issues. By the time I moved in, the couple had moved out and a mother and her three teenagers replaced them. \n\nThe noise seriously affects my sleep to the point where I need to wear earplugs every night and sometimes even that isn\u2019t enough to drown them out. I don\u2019t have guests over because I know they will not have a decent nights sleep. I can hear them slamming doors and drawers, running up and down the hallway, jumping on their beds, arguing with each other, TV on blast to the point where I know what they are watching, the mother having loud FaceTime conversations while she is seemingly on the other side of the room to her phone? This sounds crazy but I even hear them doing their washing up! They are so heavy handed it\u2019s bizarre. You should hear them when it\u2019s bedtime or the school run, it\u2019s like elephants trampolining. \n\nI\u2019ve knocked on their door several times to explain the noise is disruptive. They are apologetic but a big part of the problem is the mother doesn\u2019t acknowledge she\u2019s also part of the problem, she blames it on her kids and says \u201cI try to tell them to keep it down but at the end of the day they are teenagers so of course they are going to make noise\u201d. \n\nShe\u2019s now stopped answering her door to me! This summer over the holidays I reached breaking point, the teenagers being home constantly just meant I never got any respite and I work from home so it disrupted my work too.

You offered a MORE than generous compromise to help reduce the unreasonable noise level from the upstairs tenants.  You had no way of knowing that they were breaking the rules/terms of their lease.  \n\nReality is, knowing that they were breaking the rules, they should have been proactive in being model tenants so that the landlord did not find out.  \n\nNor is the landlord at fault--whether it is his own rule or having more than two occupants breaks some type of code--the tenants signed on for the lease with that condition.
