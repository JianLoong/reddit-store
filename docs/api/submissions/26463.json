If I were their landlord, I'd prob be glad to know as well since it doesn't sound like they're necessarily treating the space with care either. It turned out crappy for them but maybe they'll learn to be better neighbors next time.", "NTA. You had no idea they were breaking the contract and just wanted some peace and quiet.

You didn't get them kicked out, they did by breaking the rules as to how many people are supposed to be in the apt. Had they been quiet and respectful, and didn't bother you, the landlord may have never known. But their actions caused them to find out!\n\nMy complex allows 2 adults in a 1BR. My downstairs neighbors have 3; two women, married, and I think, the adult son of one of them. But they are quiet; i never hear any noise from them, so I don't say anything. But if they were loud, and bothersome all the time, you can bet I would have complained to management.", "NTA.  You offered a MORE than generous compromise to help reduce the unreasonable noise level from the upstairs tenants.  You had no way of knowing that they were breaking the rules/terms of their lease.  \n\nReality is, knowing that they were breaking the rules, they should have been proactive in being model tenants so that the landlord did not find out.  \n\nNor is the landlord at fault--whether it is his own rule or having more than two occupants breaks some type of code--the tenants signed on for the lease with that condition.

On top of that, you offered to financially contribute to a solution to fix the problem.  She's the bad neighbor who also happens to be in breach of contract.
