I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure. \n\nI went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad. \n\nSo I...\n\n- had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records. \n\n- got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices\n\n- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute\n\n- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere \n\n- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management \n\n- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors\n\n- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my \"client\" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. \n\n- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. \n\nWell, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. \n\nWell, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. \n\nBut then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. \n\nHe started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.\n\nHe told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. \n\nI was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? \n\nI was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks. \n\nAITA for how I got my boyfriend's medical bills dropped?", "created_utc": 1670275172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdk3bq/aita_for_how_i_fought_my_boyfriends_medical_bill/", "score": 36789, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I gave birth to my kid 16 years ago, they double-billed everything and it took almost A YEAR to get it all straightened out. I pretty much had to schedule hours into my weekly schedule to deal with contesting collections, getting it sent back to billing, dealing with some other person in billing, and etc. With a newborn through 1yo, and while I was also working full-time. It was an additional part time job to \"fix the damn hospital bill.\"\n\nWhat you had to do is not abnormal.", "NTA - Does he think the  hospital won't like him anymore?

Your partner sounds like my father and you like my mother. This is exactly something my mother would\u2019ve (and had) done. She hated when people were being taken advantage of. From insane hospital bills to the dreaded Comcast with their fees that steadily creep up on you she would take them on when they get a little too comfortable. I nearly fainted when I saw a bill just for lab work in the hospital that year (she had two insurances thankfully so the bill didn\u2019t crush her but it really shows how easily medical bills can put someone in a financial hole or homelessness). I hope one day America moves past this bleeding patients dry because some people refuse to go to the hospital because of how little insurance companies care.

Yes, it may have been extreme, but it was not done maliciously or inappropriately. Instead of being angry with you for sticking up for him and his rights to honest and fair medical services and billing, he should be appalled at the hospital for charging him approximately 4974 dollars more than he should have been.

They give you the runaround every time. I called multiple times a week over the course of 6 weeks. Never talked to the same person, but took notes of EVERYTHING.

These doctors and nurse fought back against her, but she was a bulldog and didn't let up. They did it to appease her and......the scans showed all the signs of a STROKE, and then they hopped to and followed procedure.   \n\n\nA lot of times patients need advocates to get reasonable care and pricing.

I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure. \n\nI went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad. \n\nSo I...\n- had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records. \n- got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices\n- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute\n- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere \n- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management \n- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors\n- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my \"client\" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. \n- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. \n\nWell, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. \n\nWell, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. \n\nBut then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. \n\nHe started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.\n\nHe told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. \n\nI was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? \n\nI was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks. \n\nAITA for how I got my boyfriend's medical bills dropped?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. You\u2019re fuckin amazing!

I\u2019m sorry your fianc\u00e9 feels he has to be a doormat and let the medical system extort him for all he\u2019s worth, but healthcare is a basic human right, and if sending a few strongly worded emails every day to annoy the board of directors into addressing the issue is what it takes to be charged a reasonable amount, more power to you! \n\nI mean it\u2019s not like you were emailing your state senators over the issue, but even if you had been, you still wouldn\u2019t be TA!", "Oh my god, my face lit up when you described what you did!

It went down to less than $5k. And they got someone in their finances office to look even more and got $2500 covered of that 5000 plus all my medications too.
