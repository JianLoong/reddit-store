I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure. \n\nI went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad. \n\nSo I...\n\n- had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records. \n\n- got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices\n\n- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute\n\n- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere \n\n- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management \n\n- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors\n\n- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my \"client\" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. \n\n- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. \n\nWell, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. \n\nWell, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. \n\nBut then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. \n\nHe started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.\n\nHe told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. \n\nI was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? \n\nI was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks. \n\nAITA for how I got my boyfriend's medical bills dropped?", "created_utc": 1670275172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdk3bq/aita_for_how_i_fought_my_boyfriends_medical_bill/", "score": 963, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I gave birth to my kid 16 years ago, they double-billed everything and it took almost A YEAR to get it all straightened out. I pretty much had to schedule hours into my weekly schedule to deal with contesting collections, getting it sent back to billing, dealing with some other person in billing, and etc. With a newborn through 1yo, and while I was also working full-time. It was an additional part time job to \"fix the damn hospital bill.\"\n\nWhat you had to do is not abnormal.", "NTA - Does he think the  hospital won't like him anymore?

Your partner sounds like my father and you like my mother. This is exactly something my mother would\u2019ve (and had) done. She hated when people were being taken advantage of. From insane hospital bills to the dreaded Comcast with their fees that steadily creep up on you she would take them on when they get a little too comfortable. I nearly fainted when I saw a bill just for lab work in the hospital that year (she had two insurances thankfully so the bill didn\u2019t crush her but it really shows how easily medical bills can put someone in a financial hole or homelessness). I hope one day America moves past this bleeding patients dry because some people refuse to go to the hospital because of how little insurance companies care.

Yes, it may have been extreme, but it was not done maliciously or inappropriately. Instead of being angry with you for sticking up for him and his rights to honest and fair medical services and billing, he should be appalled at the hospital for charging him approximately 4974 dollars more than he should have been.

They give you the runaround every time. I called multiple times a week over the course of 6 weeks. Never talked to the same person, but took notes of EVERYTHING.

These doctors and nurse fought back against her, but she was a bulldog and didn't let up. They did it to appease her and......the scans showed all the signs of a STROKE, and then they hopped to and followed procedure.   \n\n\nA lot of times patients need advocates to get reasonable care and pricing.

I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure. \n\nI went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad. \n\nSo I...\n- had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records. \n- got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices\n- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute\n- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere \n- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management \n- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors\n- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my \"client\" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. \n- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. \n\nWell, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. \n\nWell, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. \n\nBut then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. \n\nHe started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.\n\nHe told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. \n\nI was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? \n\nI was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks. \n\nAITA for how I got my boyfriend's medical bills dropped?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. You\u2019re fuckin amazing!

I\u2019m sorry your fianc\u00e9 feels he has to be a doormat and let the medical system extort him for all he\u2019s worth, but healthcare is a basic human right, and if sending a few strongly worded emails every day to annoy the board of directors into addressing the issue is what it takes to be charged a reasonable amount, more power to you! \n\nI mean it\u2019s not like you were emailing your state senators over the issue, but even if you had been, you still wouldn\u2019t be TA!", "Oh my god, my face lit up when you described what you did!

They should be held accountable, and in fact, are breaking laws by not billing and pricing correctly. Your BF sounds like someone who is passive and doesn't understand you have to be assertive to get things done.", "There was a post a while back about a woman with a side hustle where she helps people get better prices when they are buying cars.  Her boyfriend thought it was a cute little side hustle until she helped him and he saw how assertive and direct she had to be.  General consensus in the comments was that he was uncomfortable because he wouldn't be able to do what she does and it made him feel somehow less of a man.", "This totally makes sense. My husband is an engineer and capable of the same next level, unconventional but using logic, not trying to make people mad but not trying to make friends genius kind of magic. He did something similar when our property taxes went up. NTA, the world needs more people like you.", "An engineer who is assertive and has the ability to research and deal with people... Yeah, you'd probably make a hell of a project manager.", "I would pay OP $5,000 lol I bet end of year you\u2019d have just as much saved and break even", "1. You are a legend, and amazing, and saved $5k. That is a lot of money!!!\n\nJust... a slightly different perspective, and definitely anecdotal, but thought i'd put it out there. I work with a lot of contractors. I'm not sure what area of the field your BF works in, but it is not uncommon for contractors to get browbeaten by clients who can be very aggressive with the legalese, escalation, and Cc'ing, \"Whose fault is this?!?\"; \"Well it can't cost THAT much\"; \"You SAID it would be done ABC\" sort of emails and phone calls and texts. It takes a toll. The lengths some clients go to to extract every single drop from a contractor can be astonishing.\n\nI know you were fighting for him, and for his financial health; he may also identify a bit with the lower-level folks who you named & shamed as you went up the chain of command.", "Tell them that you\u2019ll take your chances and you want the itemized bill.", "Tell them you might not understand it but hired someone to go over it for you, so please send it anyways. Email them again and again.", "Fair play, I've just lived in places where it's like one big health system, so getting quality care would be tough without that system", "Yes, exactly. The system is designed to take advantage of that fear. If asked what exactly he\u2019s afraid of he likely won\u2019t be able to describe it - he\u2019s just been taught that questioning authority in this way is wrong. That\u2019s not really his fault, imo. He\u2019s one of hundreds of thousands of victims of the system, and he got incredibly lucky to have a gf that\u2019s willing to fight for him this way. Unless he yelled at her or took his anger/stress out on her, it\u2019s okay that he\u2019s upset. He just needs to learn more about how the system works and how awesome what his girlfriend did was.", "One thing you can do as well is make a complaint to your state's AG office, with all you found as well as if they didn't offer charity care. I did this and my AG sued the hospital because they found they weren't offering ANYONE charity care for like 10 years. Got a settlement for all my unpaid bills as well as money back for the bills I did pay.", "Good for you OP. You sound very resourceful", "None of that is inappropriate. You're a titan.", "This is so sexy \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udee3\nI\u2019m sure my wife would agree \ud83e\udd23", "NTA and I'm so impressed I just can't stand it!  I've done exactly the same kind of thing and I can't stand the way the health system tries to rip off people just because they can.  Your bf needs to be grateful he's got such a fighter in his corner and say thank you, very nicely.", "Yeah to be fair possibly if you were his lawyer he never would have seen the full emails / discovered how the sausage gets made. But like everyone else I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, this was the best way to navigate the American healthcare system for you and your bf so that\u2019s what you did. You did a great job.", "I am a converted member of the Church of dingussdaisy", "Not a lot of people would have had your dedication to accomplish this. As long as you were not threatening people and keeping it professional which from the sounds of it you did, good job OP :)\n\nI think your partner is a bit scared of your level of determination and power haha", "i would have done the same. i think you're fucking awesome.", " As a person who has had to go through a similar ordeal regarding my mom\u2019s hospital bill, you\u2019re MY hero. Sometimes ya gotta metaphorically knock some skulls together to advocate for the people you love.", "Not extra at all, WELL WORTH IT! I would do similar things to not have to pay FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS for a hospital bill. Hell, I call insurance and wrestle with them every month about my ~$850 monthly out of network out of pocket therapy bill that they refuse to process for \u201creasons.\u201d Insurance is a mess and saving your money is so worth it.", "If you don\u2019t mind me asking, do you have a background in law or hospital/business administration?\n\nEDIT: it sounds like you were pretending to be his lawyer or accountant just want some clarity there", "No, they mean it. They're using asshole as a compliment in this case.\n\nBecause yes, OP was totally an asshole to get that bill reduced. *And it worked.* Sometimes an asshole is exactly what you need to get a job done. Predatory businesses rely on people just going along and not wanting to be mean in order to coerce ridiculous payments out of them. OP didn't stand for it and went as long and as far as she needed to in order to get that talked down.", "In that case I commend you for your service, I would be so damn proud if you were my gf I won't lie haha", "Trust me, there are notes in his account. No but they can still treat you poorly bc they think you\u2019re an ass", "When you have twenty different doctors in one place, you go find all new ones. It\u2019s not that easy.", "All of my doctors are within th same hospital system. That includes the emergency room", "Being harassed is not any other day. His account now has notes in it that she is a pain in the ass. I would never go back there", "Seriously, this should be a profession. OP start a business and teach me your ways, I'll work for you.", "Leave him and marry me. I'm a woman and already married but my husband would understand.", "Seriously, you have mad skills at dealing with bureaucracy, along with a huge helping of focus and courage. You should be so damn proud of yourself!!", "You should write a script of sorts corresponding with the info you already listed above and sell it. Though you may need to \"give\" it as a gift when someone \"buys\" say a plushy incase of legal ramifications.\n\nHealthcare costs are atrocious in this country and the fact that hospitals and insurance companies get away with this is disgusting.", "Literally he's so ungrateful. I'd die if someone did this for me. The hospital billed me wrong several times and it takes months for them to fix. Honestly you're totally NTA and he's a huge AH.", "This is how US hopsitlas work, pretty much every bill is full of padding and overcharging. One of the first things you get told is to demand the itemised bill and start disputing it. \n\n5k down to 26 is pretty extreme, but healthcare should be free so I'm glad to see it.", "It's the US Deathcare System.", "Oh they know exactly how f-ed up it all is. She's held them accountable for once. They will never care, unless we make them.\n\nOPs bf has no reason to be mad. I can only imagine he fears they will refuse to treat or mistreat him if he was ever hospitalized again? -but doctors are not billing and they're not board members,  so it's not likely any doctors he ever saw would even recognize his name or situation.  And honestly, I have a feeling most doctors would give her a high 5 for getting rid of the ridiculous bills that keep patients from treatment.", "Right, I am also completely baffled at how he could be anything but thankful for you. \n\nDoes he think that the hospital is going to enact revenge on him somehow? Does he think someone is going to get in trouble, so maybe they will come after him? Is this a mafia hospital? \n\nIs he normally this thick and obtuse? It's fine if he is, that would be a reasonable explanation for being such a dumbass about this. \n\nNTA. Clearly. Great job, you rock!", "Exactly this. Anybody who actually does anything productive isn\u2019t going to get in trouble. In my mind this is just the upper echelons going, \u201cwell someone caught us. Oh well, there\u2019s going to be 9 other people who don\u2019t even question the bill and we\u2019ll get our money back that way.\u201d", "Fearing a consequence doesn\u2019t have to be the only reason people are upset about things. For example, if you\u2019re a huge dick to a food service/retail worker, there is rarely any consequence on your end, but you still shouldn\u2019t do it because being a dick is wrong. I think this is what OP\u2019s boyfriend is thinking. He doesn\u2019t have to fear a consequence to be upset that, from his point of view, her behavior was wrong.\n\nTo be clear, that\u2019s my read on the situation\u2014I don\u2019t agree with him. Being a jerk to a low-paid service worker over something small is miles and miles away from being a dick to *hospital administrators* who have made it their career to rake in absurd amounts of cash from sick people. Those people are assholes and deserve the heat.", "Thats the thing. OP didn\u2019t come out the gate cc\u2019ing investors. They ignored her, so she escalated things until she got results. $4,974 of results. \n\nOP\u2019s boyfriend is soooooooooooooo so so TA", "To top it off, I was fighting because they used $ I had paid off a previous bill with a year earlier. They used half that $ to pay off my child\u2019s treatment without ever sending a bill. Then started threatening collections to pay off the original payed off treatment.", "Ye I getcha. I\u2019m just pointing out that he really has no reason to complain because they can only ban him from scheduled stuff, which he could then schedule somewhere else. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll see him in the ER and stop saving his life", "Nope, honestly the most \"relevant experience\" I have, and that's even a stretch is... \n\nWanting to be an investigative journalist as a kid, and getting really into investigating corporations as a teen and college student when the internet started becoming widespread\n\nEnding up studying engineering for the money\n\nHaving a lottt of experience in bureaucracy and how to navigate it, from my jobs. Turns out being a woman in an industry that's outright hostile to women teaches you a lot about corporate law, and how to go toe to toe with a corporation and get them scared lol. \n\nBeing comfy being a total hardass but toeing the line of professionalism, being a woman in the auto engineering space definitely taught me how to do that too", "Ah, and it is a shame they have to be an AH.  Thank you, sorry for missing your point.", "I've seen \"justified asshole\" used once or twice on this sub... maybe that rating should be added here.", "This was an emergency room, halfway across the state\n\nNot either of our GPs, or any other doctors we see regularly\n\ntBH I'm hoping we don't become repeat customers at the ER anytime soon \ud83e\udd23", "Do you work in hosital administration, or are you just guessing?", "Emailing someone and conducting oneself in a professional albeit unrelenting manner is harassment?", "I can guarantee you his patient record (the one the clinical staff see anyway) has nothing related to disputed billing in there.", "People keep telling me to offer this service. Maybe I finally should. I do it all the time for people.", "Actually, even if you don't want to do this kind of thing professionally, you could make and publicize a book / YouTube video / whatever kind of instruction manual and we'd all pay for it!", "Last time I got an itemized bill, the heated blankets, that I needed because they had fluids running into me full bore, were $800 each.  For blankets.  That I didn't keep.  That were warmed in the microwave.  Yup.", "exactly. they know most people either won't even question it and or try to dispute it, or that even if people do, they likely will get fed up with waiting and being hassled that they'll give up.", "Sounds like you might have been defrauded.", "They don't want to send you the itemised bill because they know it won't match what you've been charged, or, it will be something you can poke holes in as OP did. Don't give up, you got this.", "Yeah, for sure haha. I was just providing an example of a situation that would make me swing his way. Honestly I've never heard of a hospital banning someone in any case.", "OP, you're a \\*hero\\*. Your partner is just freaking out because he realizes he's never going to be able to walk over you and if you ever divorce you'll eat him alive. I'll happily hire someone like you and pay you 10% of everything you save me off my medical bill next time I'm in the hospital", "NTA. Your posts sounds like you are in law school to be honest especially since you referenced legalese and what the law is in the comments. I\u2019m a lawyer, hence why I asked these questions as \u201crepresenting\u201d someone, even a significant other, as a non lawyer (would especially be the case if you were a law student) is a massive no no that could put one\u2019s ability to practice law in the future at stake and have pretty serious ramifications.\n\nBut since that\u2019s not the case, definitely don\u2019t see anything wrong with what you did", "I\u2019ve literally been in this situation. It\u2019s not a guess", "Emailing people on a daily basis regarding the same topic? Hell yes that harassment", "That is insane.", "Haha I definitely wasn't pretending to be a lawyer, the only times I was asked what my relationship to the patient was, I said generic non-protected terms like \"advisor\" or \"I am representing him in this billing dispute\" \n\nHaha I'll take that as a compliment! I feel like I learned a lot about law despite never studying it, just cause of some labor rights and engineering ethics disputes from a few years back", "Are you OPs boyfriend?", "The same topic said person is intentionally ignoring? Nah. Not harassment.", "Then lawyers representing patients for billing disputes also harass these hospital employees - frequent communication is how you get these things resolved.", "Do I look like a man", "You right LMAO my bad"]}
