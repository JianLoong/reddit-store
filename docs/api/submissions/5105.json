Your mother is, based on the info they make you pay for school at age 15, definitely the asshole here. She is legally obligated to provide you basic neccessaties as food, clothing and education. \n\nThe fact she has the audacity to make you pay for school yourselve and call you a terrible person when you feel you need the money to be able to go to school sounds to me like straight up financial and child abuse. You should be able to save up that money for college and living arrangements for when you will come of age, as well as spend it on some fun stuff once in a while.\n\nI hope things will get better for you.\n\nOP, NTA.", "Yes i do, i was too baffled to respond to it.
