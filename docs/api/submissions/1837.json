You'll wonder why she doesn't talk to you in a few years.", "YTA. What's the point of telling her that it isn't a big deal? I can only assume that it's to let her know that she shouldn't feel good about it or be happy about it and you are bored of it. You are a killjoy. She's doing something generative and wants to share her joy with her family.", "YTA this is exactly why kids stop talking to their parents. she wanted to be celebrated, not told that it wasn\u2019t a big deal. you can come back from this, you just have to do better.", "YTA\n\nIt's still a big deal to her and even if you can't muster enthusiasm, you don't need to actively go out of your way to rain on her parade by telling her how unimportant it is to you.  You could just say, \"Congratulations, that's great!\" and move on with your life.\n\nLike seriously, what possessed you to tell her that it \"wasn't a big deal\" when she was clearly very excited?  You had to know that was going to hurt her.  \n\nAlso referring to her \"growing out of\" various things, it almost sounds like you're one of those people that don't think creating art is real work and maybe are a little resentful of her success.  I hope I'm wrong.  You should apologize to her.", "YTA, was it worth the effort to try to squash your daughter's excitement?  What did that provide for you?\n\nor did you do it for no reason at all?", "YTA\n\nMy daughter is an artist and I can't even imagine saying this to her ever. Didn't your mother ever teach you that if you can't say something nice - don't say anything at all.\n\nArtists are amazing, talented, sometimes delicate people, they live on positive reinforcement. You just pooped on your daughter's parade.", "YTA, seriously?  You can't even just fake it?  Or actually be thrilled for her that she got another sale?  Dang.  Poor girl.", "YTA. It costs you nothing to be supportive. My mom died five years ago and I still carry pain for the ways she did not let me know she was proud of me.", "YTA. Your daughter was trying to communicate with you about something important to her. You shut her down and quite literally told her you weren't interested. Doesn't matter if you're interested or not... if your kid is important to you, then the things they are interested in/excited about also need to be important to you or they will quit talking to you about them.", "YTA\n\nWow", "YTA. Honestly, you owe her a huge apology. Way to support your kid", "YTA - It doesn\u2019t matter how many/often she is selling it\u2019s always an accomplishment and something you would think your parent would always be excited about.

How amazing if she can turn her passion into a full-time means of support for herself. Even if she doesn't eventually rely on her art for a full-time career, think of all the business and entrepreneurial skills she's learning. If she does stumble or get scammed, she'll learn from that, too. \n\nDon't you want to raise a strong daughter who knows she can always support herself if she needs to? Don't you want her to have the confidence that she doesn't have to rely on anyone else?\n\nIf she's selling original 2D art, I hope she's keeping electronic copies of each piece so she can sell unlimited digital prints of them. A lot of artists sell downloadable digital prints on Etsy, so there's no shipping or additional work on the artists' part.", "YTA\n\nJust save face, apologize, and be happy with her.

Why couldn't you be happy for her? Are you jealous, is that what this is really about? I ask because I don't think it's too much of a presumption to imagine you love your daughter, so it ought to follow that you would be happy for her. Unless there is something stopping you from feeling happy for her, like jealousy. Maybe you need to spend some time examining your conscience about that so that you can be happy for your daughter again.", "Actually, it isn't common at all.  A lot of folks only wish they were producing artists and were selling their work.", "Yeah YTA selling your art is unique. You can't think of it like the paycheck you get every couple of weeks or every month. Each sale she makes is another person validating her time and talent. You can't just treat it like another job.", "YTA. It's still an accomplishment for her and something she enjoys doing. Props to her for making money off her art", "YTA because it's a big deal to her, you might think it's no big deal but considering she is still thriving is a big deal.

SMH. \n\nI bet once your daughter has kids (if ever), on the 2nd  baby what are you gonna say to her? No big deal, since she already had 1 before?", "YTA, big big time. It is AMAZING that she is able to sell and continue to sell and every time she makes a piece it\u2019s her heart and soul in that piece and that anyone someone would pay her to have a piece of her work is an incredible compliment and exciting thing. \n\nMe and millions of people worldwide are excited for artists on YouTube that we don\u2019t even know. Artist that have millions of followers they\u2019ve been producing and selling art for years they have their own website. We still get excited for them once something new or great happens. And we don\u2019t even know these people!\n\nAny sane and logical person that has a business or has something that they do on their own to make a living that they continue to do should be excited for it, and should grow and become more and more excited about their livelihood in their business over time. You should be proud of your daughter for creating something like art, and spreading in the world. It shouldn\u2019t matter how many times or how often it happens. Do you think the parents of ballet dancers or professional sports players or movie creators no longer get excited or celebrate in the successes of those family members when they perform or create? \n\nMan you are awefull", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A job. \n\nHey mom, I have another special on the menu this week, just like every week for the last 2 years. \" OMG HONEY SO GREAT, YOURE DOING YOUR JOB IM SO IMPRESSED.\"", "I feel like a full on child is a bit different to selling online paintings. OP still should've feigned at least minimal enthusiasm though. Like another commenter said, even a brief; 'that's awesome, I'm still proud of you' would've done the job.", "My daughter turns 28 on the 24th this month, so technically she's 27, but she's 2 weeks off 28 so I don't see the big difference.", "Haha, as someone who's not very excited by pregnancies, I think it's a pretty good analogy.\n\nI *am* interested in biology and the human condition, so if I ever have female friends who get pregnant I will certainly stay interested in that aspect of it. :D", "And look at you, a maybe 60 something asshole."]}
