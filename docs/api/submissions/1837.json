You'll wonder why she doesn't talk to you in a few years.", "YTA. What's the point of telling her that it isn't a big deal? I can only assume that it's to let her know that she shouldn't feel good about it or be happy about it and you are bored of it. You are a killjoy. She's doing something generative and wants to share her joy with her family.", "YTA this is exactly why kids stop talking to their parents. she wanted to be celebrated, not told that it wasn\u2019t a big deal. you can come back from this, you just have to do better.", "YTA\n\nIt's still a big deal to her and even if you can't muster enthusiasm, you don't need to actively go out of your way to rain on her parade by telling her how unimportant it is to you.  You could just say, \"Congratulations, that's great!\" and move on with your life.\n\nLike seriously, what possessed you to tell her that it \"wasn't a big deal\" when she was clearly very excited?  You had to know that was going to hurt her.  \n\nAlso referring to her \"growing out of\" various things, it almost sounds like you're one of those people that don't think creating art is real work and maybe are a little resentful of her success.  I hope I'm wrong.  You should apologize to her.", "YTA, was it worth the effort to try to squash your daughter's excitement?  What did that provide for you?\n\nor did you do it for no reason at all?", "YTA\n\nMy daughter is an artist and I can't even imagine saying this to her ever. Didn't your mother ever teach you that if you can't say something nice - don't say anything at all.\n\nArtists are amazing, talented, sometimes delicate people, they live on positive reinforcement. You just pooped on your daughter's parade.", "YTA, seriously?  You can't even just fake it?  Or actually be thrilled for her that she got another sale?  Dang.  Poor girl.", "YTA. It costs you nothing to be supportive. My mom died five years ago and I still carry pain for the ways she did not let me know she was proud of me.", "YTA. Your daughter was trying to communicate with you about something important to her. You shut her down and quite literally told her you weren't interested. Doesn't matter if you're interested or not... if your kid is important to you, then the things they are interested in/excited about also need to be important to you or they will quit talking to you about them.", "YTA\n\nWow", "YTA. Honestly, you owe her a huge apology.

How amazing if she can turn her passion into a full-time means of support for herself. Even if she doesn't eventually rely on her art for a full-time career, think of all the business and entrepreneurial skills she's learning. If she does stumble or get scammed, she'll learn from that, too. \n\nDon't you want to raise a strong daughter who knows she can always support herself if she needs to? Don't you want her to have the confidence that she doesn't have to rely on anyone else?\n\nIf she's selling original 2D art, I hope she's keeping electronic copies of each piece so she can sell unlimited digital prints of them. A lot of artists sell downloadable digital prints on Etsy, so there's no shipping or additional work on the artists' part.", "YTA\n\nJust save face, apologize, and be happy with her.

Why couldn't you be happy for her? Are you jealous, is that what this is really about? I ask because I don't think it's too much of a presumption to imagine you love your daughter, so it ought to follow that you would be happy for her. Unless there is something stopping you from feeling happy for her, like jealousy. Maybe you need to spend some time examining your conscience about that so that you can be happy for your daughter again.", "Actually, it isn't common at all.  A lot of folks only wish they were producing artists and were selling their work.", "Yeah YTA selling your art is unique. You can't think of it like the paycheck you get every couple of weeks or every month. Each sale she makes is another person validating her time and talent. You can't just treat it like another job.", "YTA. It's still an accomplishment for her and something she enjoys doing. Props to her for making money off her art", "YTA because it's a big deal to her, you might think it's no big deal but considering she is still thriving is a big deal.

SMH. \n\nI bet once your daughter has kids (if ever), on the 2nd  baby what are you gonna say to her? No big deal, since she already had 1 before?", "YTA, big big time. It is AMAZING that she is able to sell and continue to sell and every time she makes a piece it\u2019s her heart and soul in that piece and that anyone someone would pay her to have a piece of her work is an incredible compliment and exciting thing. \n\nMe and millions of people worldwide are excited for artists on YouTube that we don\u2019t even know. Artist that have millions of followers they\u2019ve been producing and selling art for years they have their own website. We still get excited for them once something new or great happens. And we don\u2019t even know these people!\n\nAny sane and logical person that has a business or has something that they do on their own to make a living that they continue to do should be excited for it, and should grow and become more and more excited about their livelihood in their business over time. You should be proud of your daughter for creating something like art, and spreading in the world. It shouldn\u2019t matter how many times or how often it happens. Do you think the parents of ballet dancers or professional sports players or movie creators no longer get excited or celebrate in the successes of those family members when they perform or create? \n\nMan you are awefull", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Plus it\u2019s a big succes that she had sold 50 pieces in 2 years. It\u2019s not easy to make it as an artist", "YTA. I would be absolutely crush of my mother ever said she didn't care about my art anymore.", "Jeez. Do you know how hard it is to make money off art? It IS a big deal. YTA.", "NTA\n\nFor the first few sale yeah it normal to get excited! \n\nBut if she make a sale every 2 weeks you cannot be expected to have the same level excitement every time since there is nothing new about it. Something like a much bigger sale than usual, yeah get excited!\n\nIf someone has a new job you are not gonna be excited at every paycheck they get for 2 years!", "No one is going to consistently share the same level of excitement with their loved ones over their accomplishments, whether big or small. But I can't believe she had the audacity to belittle the situation, even using the words \"not a big deal.\" OP is the ultimate killjoy. \n\nYTA, obviously.", "That\u2019s harsh. But yes YTA", "Selling their work especially. \n\nCreating art is hard enough and worthy of it's own celebration. But selling? Convincing someone to spend a not so small amount of their limited disposal income on your work that is something that is always worth celebrating. Because you never know which piece of art might be the last one you ever sell.", "Exactly.   I find it hard to believe this is the only place mom is Debbie downer about her kids.  I wonder how unsupportive and judgemental she is about other things?\n\nLike if it were sports, or something she cared about, she would be supportive. \n\nI still don't know what made her go the extramarital mile to be so mean. That was completely unnecessary.", "Agree. My daughter is also an artist, I myself have no artistic talent.  I told my father that she was magical with her art,  Her art tolls was her wand.  She creates beautiful works of art that I can't fathom how she does it. To me it is magic.", "Yeah, you don't have to get hyped up excited. Just a \"that's lovely dear\" would be appropriate. My boyfriend plays video games and tells me what goes on and if he Winnie whatever build worked for him. He knows I half-zoneout, but I still ask him questions and tell him that it's cool/interesting/exciting (it's not, lol, but it is for him)\n\nMy parents tell me about the mundane renovations around their houses. My siblings tell me about the latest dog parsing kerfuffle. People talk about boring things all of the time, but they're still worth talking about because they're important to your loved ones.", "Another thing is, is that with each piece she makes and the more art she sells - she putting her name out there in the art community. And if people like what she\u2019s putting out, she could be encouraged to up her prices more and more as time passes. \n\nOPs daughter is successful in the art community and they don\u2019t even know how hard it is to get buyers for art these days. Or how hard it is to get your name out there, or how hard it is to price yourself because of comments like OPs that say \u201cuhuh your work isn\u2019t very excitable to me anymore\u201d YTA OP", "She's not young, she was 26 when she made her first and 28 now.", "She's 27", "What a bad take, holy shit YTA as well", "Honestly I think the key words here are that she tried telling the daughter that it's no longer a big deal. I'd understand simply not showing the exact same amount of heightened joy when she hears that her daughters art sold, but I think saying it isn't a big deal is kind of mean spirited. \nIf her daughter is just upset the mother isn't jumping up and down each time an art piece sells, yeah I'd agree she isn't in the wrong here. \nBut since it sounds like she told her daughter that it's simply not a big deal, that sounds like a mom down playing her daughter's achievements.", "This would be NAH, not N T A. It is kind of difficult when someone is passionate about something your not. You want the best for them and enjoy their early excitement and success. It is difficult to keep that up though. So I do feel this is a No Asshole Here situation. Maybe Op could have been a little more diplomatic in how they talked to their daughter about it. I have definitely made a nuisance of myself when I find something I am passionate about. I have been annoyed when people keep going on and on about stuff I have little interest in.", "A simple \"that's great honey\" \"that's awesome. PROUD OF YOU\" even for the millionth time means the world to them. PRETEND TO BE EXCITED EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT. YOUR KID IS. \nMy kids are (2) 8 y/o and a 12 y/o.  do you know how often I hear the same \"I did this\" moments? You know how I react EVERY TIME? LIKE I'M HEARING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME! They're excited and the fact they want to *share* that excitement with me... well I'm gonna damn well make them think I'm excited even when I'm not. You know why? *It builds them up* which btw... Definitely my job as a parent\nYta.", "INFO: Why would you say that to your daughter? Why didn't you just say, \"that's great! I'm happy for you?\" It would have cost you nothing to simply be kind, so why go out of your way to say something hurtful? And why are you surprised that she was hurt when you told her it wasn't a big deal anymore? \n\nAnd, now you are asking internet strangers to weigh in. Why not just talk to your daughter and acknowledge that you were unnecessarily hurtful and you didn't mean to do that? You really don't need the judgement of the internet, you need to just be supportive of your daughter. \n\nIt costs nothing to be kind.", "26? That is young. And makes her sales even more impressive.", "Well screw her then, happiness no longer matters to 27 y/olds\n\n\n/s"]}
