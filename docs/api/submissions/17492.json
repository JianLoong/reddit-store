Your sister is an entitled boi.", "Uh, NTA. Very obviously NTA. \n\nYou have a job. You have a previous obligation for said job. \n\nThe world does not revolve around your sister. Someone needs to give her a reality check.", "NTA.\n\n1.) Attorney work is demanding, and your sister does not understand that. It requires physical presence in many situations, and this is one of them.\n\n2.) She's entitled as fuck. I wouldn't spend 14 hours at anyone birthday party, wtf?\n\n3.) She sent you a nude of some friend of hers? What the hell? I think you have an obligation to tell that friend what she did. That's not a normal reaction.\n\nShe ain't deserving of your attention. Wow.", "Not gonna lie, this story look a crazy turn at the end there.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n\"Hello kettle, this is pot. You're pompous.\" \ud83e\udd23\n\nI find it hilarious that a ~~39~~30 year old woman who is throwing herself a 14 hour birthday on a weekday would call anyone else pompous.\n\n---\n\nEdit: fixed age. The sentiment stands.", "NTA. Sister is a spoiled, entitled brat. If she was my sister, that nasty text calling you pompous would've been it for me, and I'd have responded, \"Well then, if you're going to be mean and nasty to me, I won't be there at all.\" Then I actually wouldn't attend the party.", "Dude who said you weren't going. ,\ud83d\udc80 You said you'd go later on she needs to chill. Also please don't go. She sounds exhausting also after court and going to a party?", "NTA and your sister is a ridiculous brat. \n\nI don't have a 9-5 job and it would be nothing for me to have a Thursday off but most people I know do have work or can't take time off whenever they want.\n\nAlso adults who make a big production over their birthday as if it is a national holiday are usually exhausting to me. But anyway. She should have planned a day at the spa with a couple friends who could make it with her or a special dinner and had a big blowout on the weekend.\n\nThough I'm wondering if this is true because I don't see how a lawyer can't figure out that these expectations are ridiculous without the help of the internet.\n\nEdit because I stopped reading before she called you Chuck McGill.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nEither this is fake or OP just wants to see people bash their sister which if true I don't blame them.", "NTA your sister sounds like an immature brat.

She needs to grow the hell up", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is for cursing you out.\n\nYour sister is for sharing someone else's nude photos, presumably without their knowledge or consent.\n\nYour sister is for making a Better Call Saul reference, when she's clearly never watched or understood the show.", "NTA.

I wouldn't go at all with that attitude.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI also wouldn't work a full day and then drive three hours to attend an adult's birthday party on a weeknight. Definitely not after being screamed at about it.", "OP: Seriously, NTA. Your sister may be turning 30 years old, but this sounds like the reaction of a spoiled pre-teen. Why are you even asking? You are being a responsible adult; this often makes it hard to please demanding children. Frankly an all day party on a week day is pretty poor planning for people with regular work schedules. You are likely not the only person who can't party hardy on Thursday. For you that also involves about seven hours of driving. Yikes!", "NTA - this is your job. You're representing someone in a legal matter. Even if it's a minor situation, it will matter to your client, to the other party involved and their legal representation, and to the judge, all of whom I'm sure would also much rather be doing other things than sitting in court. You're showing all of these people some basic respect by doing your job.\n\nAnd despite the fact that he's a fictional character, one thing you can always say of Saul Goodman is that he goes to some pretty extreme lengths for his clients, even at detriment to himself, so your sister's analogy is pretty poor.", "NTA and also your sister sounds insufferable. That's not normal behavior.", "INFO: Uh, what the actual fuck is going on with her sending nudes just because you have a job?", "NTA, but I'm really confused by a lawyer who doesn't have the ability to tell a sibling to stop being a jerk.", "NTA.  Some people have jobs that they can't simply take a random day off on.  I'm sure whomever you are representing would be pretty upset if you weren't in court because you went to a party.  It's also really weird that she sent you a naked picture of someone else, especially without that person's consent?", "What did Katie have to do with it?", "NTA\u2026\u2026 how else could I read this story\n\n\nDoes sister really expect working friends & families to attend 9am to 11pm weekday party?\n\n\nAnd if someone regrettably declines the invitation, does she throw insults at them on their work they take seriously?\n\n\nThen nude photo of her recent flirt, for what?\n\n\nIs it just something she does to her sister, or to other friends & families?", "I\u2019m confused on why she was sending you nudes but whatever, NTA. Is she 30 going on 13? No real adult would expect another adult to miss a court date over a 14 hour birthday party.", "Nta.... BUT you could totally go.  Lawyers reschedule things all the time.  (Yes I am lawyer) even court dates.  That's not to say you should reschedule and your sister is being a major A to expect people to take a day off work for her party.  I personally wouldn't reschedule based on her comment alone about what you're of lawyer you'll be.  She sounds miserable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
