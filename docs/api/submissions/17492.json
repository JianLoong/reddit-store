She sent you a nude of some friend of hers? What the hell? I think you have an obligation to tell that friend what she did. That's not a normal reaction.\n\nShe ain't deserving of your attention.

Definitely not after being screamed at about it.", "OP: Seriously, NTA. Your sister may be turning 30 years old, but this sounds like the reaction of a spoiled pre-teen. Why are you even asking? You are being a responsible adult; this often makes it hard to please demanding children. Frankly an all day party on a week day is pretty poor planning for people with regular work schedules. You are likely not the only person who can't party hardy on Thursday. For you that also involves about seven hours of driving. Yikes!", "NTA - this is your job. You're representing someone in a legal matter. Even if it's a minor situation, it will matter to your client, to the other party involved and their legal representation, and to the judge, all of whom I'm sure would also much rather be doing other things than sitting in court. You're showing all of these people some basic respect by doing your job.\n\nAnd despite the fact that he's a fictional character, one thing you can always say of Saul Goodman is that he goes to some pretty extreme lengths for his clients, even at detriment to himself, so your sister's analogy is pretty poor.", "NTA and also your sister sounds insufferable.

Some people have jobs that they can't simply take a random day off on.  I'm sure whomever you are representing would be pretty upset if you weren't in court because you went to a party.  It's also really weird that she sent you a naked picture of someone else, especially without that person's consent?", "What did Katie have to do with it?", "NTA\u2026\u2026 how else could I read this story\n\n\nDoes sister really expect working friends & families to attend 9am to 11pm weekday party?\n\n\nAnd if someone regrettably declines the invitation, does she throw insults at them on their work they take seriously?\n\n\nThen nude photo of her recent flirt, for what?\n\n\nIs it just something she does to her sister, or to other friends & families?", "I\u2019m confused on why she was sending you nudes but whatever, NTA. Is she 30 going on 13? No real adult would expect another adult to miss a court date over a 14 hour birthday party.", "Nta.... BUT you could totally go.  Lawyers reschedule things all the time.  (Yes I am lawyer) even court dates.  That's not to say you should reschedule and your sister is being a major A to expect people to take a day off work for her party.  I personally wouldn't reschedule based on her comment alone about what you're of lawyer you'll be.  She sounds miserable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
