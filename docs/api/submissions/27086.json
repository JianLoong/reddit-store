AITA?", "selftext": "Sorry for any mispellings and the formatting.\n\nI've (F17) never been close to my parents. I wasn't planned since both my parents had me when they were 18. My father always leave me clear that I was a mistake and that if i wasn't born he could have had a normal life for a 18-years-old (parties, dating, pursuing his career). My mother wasn't like this; but she's always been really cold and never showed me any kind of affection, but she cared about my well- being at least.\n\nThis made my upbringing extremely hard because I didn't even have any other familiar that could take care of me. This for obvious reasons fucked me up a lot. When i was 14 my parents divorced and almost instantly my dad meet this another woman \"Lila\" and they got engaged. After their split, i mostly stayed with my mom because when i went to my dad's it was so clear that nobody wanted me here and at least my mom was kind of more tolerant of me. \n\na year ago, my dad married Lila and they had a baby boy that they named \"Alex\". Alex was actually planned, this was clear since both my dad and Lila were really happy about it and adorned their home full of pics of Axel. They pucharsed a lot of toys for him, treated him with so much love. And this only fucked me up more and if i am honest, jealous to see how much my dad loved this kid but he never loved or treated me like that.\n\nsince my brother was born, i have stopped visiting my dad and stopped talking to him because now i feel much more pain. For some reason he has tried to make me go to his place to spend time and \"bond\" with Axel but i refuse everytime because seeing that kid really brings me so much pain. my dad has also even asked me to babysit the kid, which i also refused.\n\nmy mom has asked me why i haven't go to my dad's anymore, i hesitantly told her the truth and she told me that i should try to bond with the child since he's my only sibling and he's not at fault. I told her that i didn't want to and that i am not planning to bond with him or visit my father.\n\nIf I am 100% honest, i feel really bitter and salty towards the toddler. i know he's not at fault but i can't help it, i can't even see him in pics. I need to know if I am really being too overdramatic and the AH for feeling like this towards an innocent child. Bc i'm feeling really affected just by seeing how much they love and cherish him. I know that it's a kid and he deserves all the love and joy, but i would just prefer to stay away from him as much as i can.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694981299, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lapen/aita_i_dont_want_to_bond_with_my_little_brother/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have zero obligation to do this. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou're not being dramatic, you're trying to heal from childhood abuse and this baby has triggered a lot of bad memories for you. Even if the child is innocent, your mental health and well-being come first. It would be a bad idea even for him if you force a relationship. You should try seeing a therapist if you haven't already.", "Nta.  Not the baby's fault but your dad legit poisoned your relationship", "You\u2019re not being over dramatic at all, but it may be worth asking your mom to see a therapist both alone and with her. Getting your feelings out with a professional and possibly improving your relationship with your mom could go a long way in helping you to live a happier adult life.\n\nNTA and lots of love.", "NTA.  Most likely your dad just wants you to bond with his new son - so that he can rely on you for free/easy babysitting.  Period.\n\nYou can't choose who you share your blood with.  You can choose who you share your time with.  Sounds like you are choosing wisely.", "Of *course* your dad wants you to bond with his new, shiny, wanted son. He wants you to be his babysitter. Yeaaa, no. \n\nHe could have given a damn about you all these years. NTA", "NTA- You aren\u2019t punishing your half-brother. You are keeping yourself from feeling hurt. I\u2019m also pretty certain your father wants you to bond with him so they can get a free babysitter.", "NTA. I'm 100% sure that \"bond\" means babysit in this situation. I wouldn't want to go over there either.", "NTA and I'm so sorry your childhood was like this.  You are not in the wrong for not wanting to see \"what it could have been like\" if your dad had given a damn.", "NTA and it seems like it would be better for your mental health to just stay away. With such a large age gap it's unlikely you'd be close anyway and I suspect your father is looking for a babysitter rather than a big sister. It's not punishing a child to not have a relationship with them and you have every reason to be hurt over how you were treated.", "NTA Tell your father how you feel-- every-- last-- detail. Tell him how horrible he made you feel for 17 years and how all of that pain is dredged up each time you see him doting on the child he wants. Tell him that's why you want nothing to do with him or his son.\n\nIf you do this I can see your father realizing just how badly he treated you and either cutting contact because he's a selfish prick, or suddenly realizing just how horrible he was for doing that to his own flesh and blood. In either case, you'll have gotten that all off your chest and it will likely be a huge weight lifted off of you.\n\nThen get some help. Talk to your mom about seeing a therapist to help you work through your feelings about the situation. It can only help.\n\nIn the end, you might even find a way to forgive your dad, and/or find common ground with your half-brother. Maybe your dad will even try to make things right with you and support you into adulthood with whatever you are choosing to do from here on out. Stranger things have happened.", "NTA.  No reason for you to go.", "NTA.  You had a shitty childhood with shorty parents.\nIt\u2019s sad the you are resenting the baby as he\u2019s not guilty. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to bond with it now, but try to put the blame on the right person. This baby doesn\u2019t deserve your hate or your scorn. Maybe when he is older you can  have a relationship with him.

You may feel differently later but your brother will have no memory of you now. So toss that back at dear old dad and see what happens.", "NTA my mother would often say holding a grudge is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. But, I too am a mistake and understand what you feel - it's fine for you to move on. I actually did write a letter to my father explaining why we would never have a lot of contact. I didn't get accusing but wrote out things that happened, how it made me feel, how his actions had destroyed my self esteem and how hard I had to work to get past it. People tend to rewrite scripts in their head - I was often surprised he felt he was a good father. No matter what, your dad will get defensive and say that never happened, etc. The only response should be \"I'm sorry you feel that way, but the conversation is over\" - don't get drawn into defending yourself. And if you haven't had therapy I would suggest it - it took me 4 years and a stint in a group home but I'm married to a wonderful man, raised 2 great sons and enjoyed a career in medicine. You cannot control the behavior of others, but you can control the way you react. Good luck and keep moving forward", "NTA.\n\nThere's no way to say this without being condescending, but the way you feel is completely normal and appropriate for a 14 year old.\n\nYour dad really messed up. Of course it's not wrong that he's treating Alex this way. But it's really wrong that he's not trying to be a better father to you too.", "NTA but try to not hate the kid. He didn\u2019t do anything. Be mad and hurt at dad. My dad left me as a toddler and made it clear that he never wanted me. A daughter. Even told me I ruined his life. When I was 18. He married his 6th wife and they had 3 kids together. One being a daughter. He loved her so much. Would hold her on his lap. Remembered her birthday. She was everything to him. I never hated her. All kids should be loved like that. I thought there just something really wrong with me for him to not love me like that. Didn\u2019t help he would take out my older brother with my mom out all the time. I was never close to his second family. Never hung out with the kids. Even now that we all have families and things. I still don\u2019t talk to them. I don\u2019t hate them. I didn\u2019t even dislike them. I don\u2019t know them. I did hate my father. One time he even doted on my sister and acted like SHE was his daughter and not me. Eventually. I stopped hating him. I feel nothing for him. I hear he\u2019s dying. I feel nothing. Don\u2019t let the patheticness of your father bring you down. Release the hate and bitterness. It\u2019s just hurting you. Just let them go. They are people and nothing more. Give him and the family all\nThe attention you would give a stranger you met for 2 minutes. They deserve nothing more.", "Your parents simply got what they gave. Do you feel like the free babysitter in training? Test this theory by asking your Dad to a father-son [only] lunch to catch up on things. Public places are great locations, to be honest, as nobody makes scenes. Accept his possible no with a neutral response, thanking him for the phone conversation .\n\nSorry you are not recognized as family. In time, you will move out and build a positive life, not jaded by the poor decisions of others. Choose when to share history as many have no idea how to react.", "NTA - it\u2019s not Alex\u2019s fault either, but there\u2019s a 16 year age difference between the two of you, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re missing out on the typical sibling/step-sibling relationship. Besides, why would you want to have your face rubbed in seeing how your \u201cnew and improved dad\u201d is clearly loving this version of parenthood. \n\nOn a personal note, parenting is hard. I\u2019m an older parent and have the perspective that age provides and the benefit of choosing this specific life with my eyes wide open, but I\u2019m still working on not screwing my kids up on a daily basis. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your dad hasn\u2019t been able to see you around his disappointment and frustration over how his life went, but, I\u2019m hoping that if you ever have a conversation with him over how he made you feel, he\u2019d try to explain that, sure, he didn\u2019t plan on becoming a dad so early and blames that for many of the things he\u2019s disappointed in, but that he\u2019s never blamed or hated you for it. That you were the bright part of something he never planned on. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t think that and find a way to make sure you understand that - I\u2019m sorry - and screw him. Go be a better person.", ">If I am 100% honest, i feel really bitter and salty towards the toddler\n\nHes too young still to understand this, so no feelings are hurt. But I would maybe think about the future.\n\nNot really an AH behavior on your end, just saying it as more of an advice.", "You\u2019re NTA, OP, you are young and making decisions out of hurt from your family of origin. You\u2019re not the cause for that hurt, you\u2019re just responsible for how you take care of it now that it\u2019s been dumped on you, and your instinct to protect yourself is not bad. I\u2019m sorry you have to carry all those years of feeling unwanted. I feel bad for your half-brother as well, because he\u2019s being deprived of family. As are you! Being a big sister can be a really beautiful thing. However, it\u2019s his dad who is to blame for this. He has the responsibility to create an environment for you and your half-brother where it\u2019s possible for you to know each other without competition or harm. \n\nIf your dad wants you to bond with his new son, he needs to acknowledge his harm and try to repair his relationship with you. I\u2019d suggest saying something along the lines of \u201cLook Dad, our relationship is broken. If you want me to be part of your life or your son\u2019s life, you have to take steps to repair with me. Without that, I am not able to be in your son\u2019s life because it\u2019s not fair to me or him. If you want this from me, then what I need from you is to go to therapy with me, work through our issues, and prove that you\u2019re a safe relationship.\u201d (And if you start this process, take babysitting off the table). \n\nBut maybe think about what it is you actually want and need at the deepest level and try to articulate that. Boundaries are good! And they\u2019re also meant to be bridges as much as possible. Outline what you want/need and what you\u2019re able/willing to do to get it and give him an opportunity to make his decisions instead of putting the blame on you. In reality, he may never be able to give you what you need, but at least you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s not your fault, that you are growing, learning, standing up for yourself, and healing enough to be okay despite his failures. \n\nEither way, OP, getting in to see a therapist and starting that healing process would be a good thing for you, whether your dad participates or not. Get some support, you deserve it. \u2764\ufe0f", "You feel like you don't have family this kid is YOUR FAMILY.", "I\u2019m not going to really say you\u2019re TA because I don\u2019t believe your post is about your brother. It\u2019s clear your father\u2019s behaviour has hurt you. Your issue is with him - not Axel.\n\nI\u2019m not going to justify your father\u2019s behaviour towards you when you were growing up. Have you ever discussed your feelings with your dad? Leaving Axel out of it, I think the real issue here is the way your father treated you. It\u2019s a disconnect to see the parent he is capable of being to Axel when he was not capable of that for you.\n\nI believe your father *does* love you in his own flawed way\u2026 unfortunately, that isn\u2019t something he is able to express other than through trying to get you involved with Axel as opposed to making the effort to know you for who you are.\n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you what you should do, but your mother is right about one thing - Axel is your sibling & nothing here is his fault. You have a large age difference so while you may never be extremely close, you may grow to love him & appreciate having your own unique bond with him. You don\u2019t have to decide right now.
