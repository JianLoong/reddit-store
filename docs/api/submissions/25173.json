Me and my family had bought a villa in Spain in 2018, me and my 4 siblings all pay our part of it and and I decided to bring some friends on holiday with me this year.\n\nMe (19F) and my friends (19-20F) has decided to go on an all girls holiday since I had just got out of a relationship with a really toxic guy and so did my other friend, so we went to celebrate. I have nothing against my friends having boyfriends as long as they are good for eachother and treat eachother well.\n\nWhen I invited my 6 friends, they were all so happy to come. I told them that they\u2019d only have to pay for their tickets and I\u2019d take care of the rest like shopping and other stuff. One of my friends was not so happy as hee and hee boyfriend were attached at the hip. I\u2019ll call her Stacy for now. Stacy privately messaged me saying how rude I was for not inviting her boyfriend on holiday to MY villa and that I was a bad friend, I had told her that if she wanted to go away with him, she can do that by herself and we are having a girls holiday. She then got her boyfriend to start messaging me saying I was a horrible friend then I told him to book his own holiday with his girlfriend. He left me on opened and I haven\u2019t heard from him since. My friend Stacy had kept apologising to me and begged myself to bring her with us and I told her she can stop acting like a complete cunt and all my friends had unfriended her.\n\nI\u2019m now getting messages from Stacey\u2019s cousins, sister and her new group of friends, AITA for not bringing her and her boyfriend?", "created_utc": 1692619695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x5t7v/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friends_boyfriend_on/", "score": 227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What part of **girls trip** are they failing to understand??", "I'll never understand why people think that they're entitled to other people's time, money, possessions etc. You did a nice thing by offering your friends free accommodation at your villa and then you cop all this shit for it. You're NTA at all. Question though, is Stacy apologising and asking if she can just come or is she still trying to wangle a space for a her boyfriend?", "NTA. They seem confused about what a \"girls trip\" means. And wild they feel entitled to access to your property. Glad your other friends agreed that couple was out of line.\n\nSounds like cutting them off  was a good move and you have yet another thing to enjoy and celebrate on your trip!", "NTA\n\nShe tried to get her BF to crash your group, and then they both harassed you about it", "NTA, you are inviting your girl friends for a girls trip, not a girls and other people who are living with them trip. Go with your real friends and block them both.", "NTA. Stacy was out of line reproaching you and her relatives are way, way out of line sticking their noses in. I\u2019m sorta shaking my head at the sheer entitlement of the family Stacy was raised in. Bless her heart, maybe she didn\u2019t know any better due to how she was brought up but it was time she learned.", "NTA girls trip to your property, not a free for all , don't ever holiday with her again you don't need all that crap she is bringing, just think how bad it would be if she came now you don't owe her anything go have fun with your friends.", "NTA. Why would you invite someone who couldn\u2019t handle a No graciously and chose to harass you instead? She sounds like the kind of AH that would still spring her boyfriend on you and expect you to be too polite to kick him out.", "NTA\n\nYou wanted a girls only trip and Stacey thought she was above the rules.", "If you were my friend I would have just been happy to be invited I would never have even thought to ask for someone else to tag along that's plain cheeky", "NTA\nHer campaign of harrassment would be the end of that friendship for me. Maybe, after she breaks up and it turns out the bf was a controlling turd, you could be open to an arm's length renewal of the friendship. IF she acknowledged her hurtful behavior after your invitation and won't repeat it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Stacy messed it all up for herself by insisting her BF come as well.  And then her BF really went over the line.  I mean, you can take her if you want to, but she'll need to behave and not be bitchy.", "NTA.", "I hate friend like this so I can not thing straight.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  It's a GIRLS trip and it is wildly in appropriate for her to demand that her BF be invited as well.  Stacy's cousins, sister and friends can all chip in and pay for her and her BF to have a vacation if they are so concerned.", "The part where she and her boyfriend don't get a mostly-free romantic vacation primarily at OP's expense.\n\nObviously she's NTA. Stacy didn't even want to vacation with OP, really . . . she just wanted free use of a villa, meals, etc. so she and her BF could take advantage.", ">Question though, is Stacy apologising and asking if she can just come or is she still trying to wangle a space for a her boyfriend?\n\nDoesn't really matter tbh, he apologize will feel fake regardless, the only reason she's apologizing is because she still wants that free villa stay, not because she's actually sorry.", "I think if you said she could go, she would still show up with boyfriend and still try to push his presence on all of you.", "Yes, she sounds like she could be a \"don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness\" kind of person.", "NTA.

Why sic your family on someone? It\u2019s ridiculous. I hope the five of you enjoy your girls vacation!", "OP, NTA - everything just confirms that Stacey needs to be blocked and dropped, period.", "INFO: How did the rest of your friend group find out about what Stacey told you?", "NTA.
