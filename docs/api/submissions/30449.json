The fight started because I declined to give a speech at the vow renewal and my dad asked me why. I was not in a great place because during the vow renewal my dad said that all other women that came before his wife were meaningless and that he had to go through a lot of wrong choices to get to the right one. His choice of words were hurtful because my mom came before his wife. His first wife. The woman who gave him me. I was only a baby when she died and my dad was young (22) but he used to claim he loved her and he told me his wife wasn't replacing her and he didn't love her more. But that is now apparently untrue. Maybe he said that because I was a kid. But sitting there listening to your dad talk about your mom as meaningless and knowing she's considered one of the \"a lot of wrong choices\" is not fun. I had nothing I could say after hearing that so I declined to make a speech. My dad confronted me on it and then he told me it shouldn't bother me and why would I hate hearing the woman who raised me is his number one. I told him I was 10 when I met her so it wasn't like she replaced anyone for me. I never knew mom but I knew about mom and I had my maternal family so I always loved her and considered her my mom.\n\nApparently my dad disclosed this to two of my younger siblings (18f and 17m). After the first started he continued to text or call just to tell me I had no right to be angry or to dislike his words. He said he should be allowed to feel how he wants about his romantic relationships. I told him to let it go and stop bringing it up. After I told him that my siblings came to my house and said that we needed to talk. My sister asked how I could be mad that dad loved our mom so much. She asked how I could say she's not the most important woman in my life. She claimed her mom is my mom and I can't claim otherwise. My brother said it wasn't fair to expect dad to love someone who died 28 years ago and to keep her on the same level as their mom. My sister said I should apologize and told me to tell her mom I love her because she heard about the fight and she's upset about my reaction.\n\nI tried to stop the conversation before it could get to where it did but they talked over me. So when I got the chance I told them to stay out of the fight because it's between me and dad, not them, and I did not want to fight with them. My sister told me it involved them because their parents marriage is being attacked. I told her the fight between dad and me was none of their business and to leave because I will not see things the way they do.\n\nThey said I was an asshole for minimizing their business in the fight. Then my dad texted me saying I was grown enough not to dismiss my siblings like that.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699289109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p6zdn/aita_for_telling_my_siblings_to_stay_out_of_the/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't get it.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is an asshole for calling your mom's relationship meaningless and then sending your half-siblings over as his flying monkeys to continue to harass you.", "NTA. Your dad needs to call off his dogs. It is 100% not your half-sibling's business and that they feel so strongly that it is speaks to immaturity and manipulation on his part. It also has nothing to do with your step-mother either as she didn't drag your mom into it. \n\nYour mother was not irrelevant or a mistake and to label her as such publicly was cruel and unnecessary. They would be livid if the same thing happened to their mother with his next wife.", ">He said he should be allowed to feel how he wants about his romantic relationships.\n\nBut apparently you aren't allowed to have your feelings about what he said about your mother. NTA\n\nYour dad was being completely insensitive and brutal to publicly say, in front of you, that your mother was \"meaningless\" to him and the \"wrong choice.\" He is allowed to have his feelings, sure, but there were a thousand ways he could have expressed his love without shitting on the other women in his life, especially your mother as he knew you'd be there listening.\n\nYour siblings don't get to decide your feelings for you either, and they are missing the point besides. Your dad didn't have to put things the way he did. There was no need to disrespect your mother just because he wanted to celebrate his wife. And your siblings are wrong to make it a competition too. You didn't start that -- your father did -- and he must have framed things in a way to your siblings that had them come at you guns blazing like that. Shame on him. All your dad had to do was leave your mother out of it altogether. Now he's even involving your siblings in his \"number one\" campaign. How gross. How counter-productive. How absolutely unnecessary.", "NTA...Your response was the right one.  You told your dad how you felt, but don't wish to fight with your siblings.  You're allowed to feel how you feel, and everyone has to accept that.", "NTA. Your dad is an asshole for not realizing how his words could hurt you. You had your biological mom for 10 years. That's incredibly formative and you will always love her. It's unfortunate your dad felt the need to make comparisons at all, because that's not necessary to tell someone you love them. He should have thought about your feelings before he said that. It's crazy how much your family wants to control how you feel. Your feelings make sense, and even if they didn't it's not their role to tell you how to feel about this. You family sounds entitled. I hope the noise around this dies down soon. It should just be in the past at this point and they should respect your feelings.", "NTA. That was a thoughtless and unnecessary thing for your dad to say, and I would have felt uncomfortable about it even if I\u2019d just been a guest at the wedding. If the love is so pure, then why do you need to cut anyone down to prove it, you know?\n\nIt sounds like your dad and siblings are creating straw man arguments to discredit your feelings. You aren\u2019t asking him to honor your mother or declare his undying love for her. You\u2019re just asking that he not publicly insult her in your presence as part of a wedding toast, which is pretty basic human decency.\n\nYour dad wants to be able to express his feelings, but doesn\u2019t think you have the same right. And your siblings can\u2019t relate to how you\u2019re feeling about it, so they need to back off.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad said, \u201che should be allowed to feel how he wants about his romantic relationships.\u201d\n\nAgree with him!  He can totally feel how he wants, and that\u2019s his right!  Just like it\u2019s *your* freaking right to feel however *you want* about his actions.\n\nSee how that works?\n\nThe problem here is that your dad is a narcissist who believes everything he does is right and everyone should support him on that, and if they don\u2019t, they\u2019re haters/ungrateful/non-supportive/etc.  How dare you not buy into his worldview?  And now he\u2019s enlisted his children into helping him.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to do: stop explaining things to him and his children.  Explanations, for normal people, are tools to help you understand each other\u2019s actions, so that this understanding can lead to grace and compromise.  For your father and his brood, your explanations are tools that they are going to twist to show you how wrong you are.  You can explain until you\u2019re blue in the face, and your dad will *never* agree with you because that would require him to entertain, for a second, that\u2019s he\u2019s not completely right.  That will never happen.\n\nAnd as long as his kids are like your dad, or following his instructions, they will be exactly the same.\n\nDon\u2019t tel the kids to butt out.  *Ignore them*.  Every time it comes up, say, \u201cThat\u2019s it between me and dad, so I\u2019m not going to talk about it.\u201d  If they continue to talk about it, say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, since you want to continue to talk about this when I\u2019ve already said I won\u2019t, I\u2019m going to have to hang up now.  Talk to you later.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re just getting sucked into this drama and there\u2019s no way to win.", "\u201cHere\u2019s to dad and his wife. Before her, every other woman sucked. Including my mom.\u201d\n\nNTA.", "NTA your dad is a giant ah. You are right and entiteld to feel this way. They come and Tell you their Feelings and Views matter more than your screw them.\n\nYou love your Mom and you only have her as a Mom. They need to respect that or stay away", "NTA\n\nYour feelings are valid. Your dad practically said that being with your bio mom was a mistake and by extension you as you said. If I read this correctly you are not upset about him loving his current wife, which is what they are hounding you about, but rather the implications of his feeling towards you. Your dad probably twisted what happened and in the heat of anger they aren't thinking. End of the day you're right, this is between you and your dad and no one else.", "NTA - they need to mind their business and stop saying such hurtful and ridiculous things like their mom being the most important person to you - what? That\u2019s the most tone deaf thing I\u2019ve heard in a while and that\u2019s saying something. It\u2019s okay to give yourself some space from all of them if they can\u2019t stay out of your business.", "NTA.  There is no fight to be had.  You cherish your mother's memory and are defending that.  What they expect of you is pretty self-centered, in my opinion.   You might want to reassure your step-Mom you meant no disrespect to her, but you don't owe anyone an apology.", "NTA. \n\nIt's amazing how everyone in your family is entitled to their feelings, but you aren't.", "It was **NOT** about him loving his current wife.\n\nIt was about him naming OP's mom meaningless and a wrong choice...\n\nAnd by consequence, was OP a wrong choice as well?\n\nNTA\n\nThis is a hill to die on.", "NTA, he called your mom *a mistake.* That's different than saying she's the most important woman in his life (which, she is).", "Are these half siblings? So your stepmom is their mom?", "NTA\nholy moly. \n\nFirst off, the dad is an ass for saying that in front of his son who was once his wife.\n\nSecondly, those step-siblings need to chill because their mom is not being talked about here and the parents relationship is not attacked. Just because she is the mom does not mean that you will/must have the same connection with her as them. \nI think what those step siblings said were just unnecessary and should be more aware and empathetic. \n\nYou just declined an offer for VALID reasons and your dad and step siblings is making the situation worser. \nI'm 18 and I do not know much about marriage and how it feels to have step siblings and all but what I do know is that being empathetic and nice doesn't hurt.\n\nSo, NTA.", "NTA. The good news is I don\u2019t think anyone intended to be an asshole or otherwise rude. That means that I doubt this isn\u2019t something that can be worked through. \n\nGood luck. It\u2019s going to be rough but I think you can all make it through this together. They have to commit to understanding your feelings and how what was said came across to you even if entirely unintentional.", "NTA. I understand what your dad was trying to say, but this wasn't an impromptu speech, right? He planned out what he wanted to say. He should have taken your feelings into consideration. The vow renewal is about the couple, sure. But he doesn't get to make you feel insignificant in the speech that honors his wife. There were so many other ways to say what he wanted to say. He should have done it differently.   \n\n\nGetting your siblings involved was probably his idea, and the term for them being used that way is 'flying monkeys.' He can't do the work himself, so he sends his minions to make you feel terrible for being rightfully frustrated with his deliberate choice of phrasing. The argument between you and your dad isn't even really about his marriage to your siblings' mother. It's about the way he said that his relationship to your mother, and your own existence (by extension) were mistakes. But it's difficult for a flying monkey to understand that, because they're only going by what the narcissist has told them. If you take the time to talk to your siblings, you'll find out that they were told something much different than what actually happened. But I think that this might not be a new thing for any of you.", "NTA. Your Dad was insensitive. He is entitled to his feelings, but sometimes we have to keep our feelings to ourselves if it means they would hurt others. I can understand why you would have been too choked up to give a speech. \n\nEven if you adore your step-mom, your Dad should have been more respectful regarding your  bio mother. She was still your birth mom. \n\nYes, your siblings should keep out of this instead of exacerbating the problem. \n\nYour father owes you an apology for hurting you. Even if your mother had been a drug addict, an alcoholic, a gambling addict, and a prostitute, he still hurt you unnecessarily and for that he should feel bad.", "NTA - I think your dad may have chosen not the best words, but I get what he means. I also get why you would have this reaction. He doesnt get to tell you that you cant be angry, he\u2019s an AH for that. \n\nI also think your siblings are sort of justified in coming to you - but you dont have to entertain them if you dont want to, but them sharing their feelings about the situation doesnt make them AHs. You sort of are doing what your dad did to you, to them. Telling them their feelings arent valid.", "NTA- But it seems like an over sensitive reaction to what your dad was saying OP. Likely the response from the rest of the family is because the concerns were communicated in the form of an argument or fight instead of trying for both sides to actually understand each other.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He can love his current wife more than another other wife. But to say that your mother was meaningless was just nasty and your siblings should be supporting you. He didn't have to make a choice. He could have said he was grateful to have had two important loves in his life. He could have a said a lot of things, but chose to say that she was a wrong choice and meaningless. How could that not hurt you?", "NTA - ask them that if tomorrow their mum dies (god forbid) and dad remarried how would they feel if he says at the wedding how his new wife showed him what true love was, how everything that happened the death of his wives was ok just so he could meet her?? \n\nInevitably they will say something like that would never happen blah blah blah - it already did - to you. \n\nTheir dad (your dad) has already shown he no longer cares about his women once they die, it won\u2019t be any different with their mum if she dies first.  And if they think differently they are beyond dumb. \n\nOh and tell your dad if he is so confident in his stance that it\u2019s ok what he said. Ask him to put it on his social media - ask him to write about how he is glad his first wife died and was completely meaningless to him because of how much he loves his current wife, that the mother of his first child who died in childbirth was a waste of the time he spent with her and how he had to lie to his child about loving her because he was just a kid and wouldn\u2019t understand how little he cared about her death because of his preference for his second. See what happens. He won\u2019t put that out. \nWhich shows he knows it\u2019s a dick move", "Nta- you are 100% in the rt. Your dad is definitely an AH and so are his flying monkeys aka your sibs", "I hope your siblings are on Reddit and find your post and read these comments. They\u2019re basically adults and fighting daddy\u2019s war for him because he involved them. So I\u2019m going to assume that if they wanna be in a grown people\u2019s fight, they can handle the comments.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA and you know you aren\u2019t: your feelings are valid. Your dad disrespected the memory of your mother in front of strangers and in front of his own son. He essentially said that you\u2019re meaningless as well, because you came from a \u201cmeaningless\u201d woman. While trying to be romantic, he devalued your mothers memory. And that\u2019s an asshole move to pull. You being affronted and disappointed doesn\u2019t make you one. You have feelings and are allowed to feel them.  You\u2019ve tried several times to tell your AH father to leave it alone but he\u2019s refusing because deep down he knows he messed up but rather own up to it he doubles and brings in your half siblings. \n\nI would throw their argument right back at them the next time they try to fight you: how would THEY feel if their father said this about their mom?? I\u2019m mad for you. So very much so. They\u2019re the AHs for trying to invalidate your feelings so they can feel better about themselves. Because deep down they know what they did was crappy. \n\nIf I were you, time to go LC. They bring nothing to your life at the moment. Families need to respect the feelings of others and learn the consequences when they fuck around.", "NTA and what your dad said was really insensitive.

I don't blame you for being hurt and angry.", "I think your father could have perhaps predicted you'd be annoyed but I don't think he's TA. Romantic love has nothing to do with his relationship with you as your dad. He may well feel that his new wife is the love of his life and everything pales in comparison, it doesn't take anything from you. I think \"meaningless\" was an unfortunate word to use and probably, if you ask him, not what he meant. He has you which has meaning for him im sure.", "Neither do I.

But he and my mom were married still and he tried to reassure me when I was a kid that he loved her. So to listen to him declare that she was meaningless to a room full of people stung.\n\nThe whole competition thing makes it worse.

Telling him he insulted his step-mother and owes her an apology is ridiculous.

They won't be able to see your side because it's not their side. You're right to refuse to engage. \n\nIf your step-mom is at all reasonable I might try to get her to corral her kids into staying out of it.", "Your dad is making such a basic, stupid mistake in conflating the intensity of his emotions with needing to take an extreme black and white position to express those emotions -- as if everything must be seen as perfect in and surrounding his current relationship, and everything before it viewed as being worthless, or he isn't being faithful to his love. It's like a reversion to mental and emotional adolescence.", "Honestly, the way your dad approached this whole thing is gross. It leaves an awful taste in my mouth. And I'm a stranger on the internet. I can't imagine how you feel. Not only did your dad misstep in what he said during his wedding speech, he dared to turn his other kids against you. (You were right, btw. This is between you and your dad. And besides, your dad should have acted as the parent and the more mature adult, the one with the more level head. For him to instigate drama and sync flying monkeys on you is just... Ugh. I'm so disgusting on your behalf. There's no excuse for him to sell out his first wife and her child just because he just got himself a new wife.) \n\n\nThe only (slightly) bright side of this that I can see is that (if your half sibs were being truthful) your dad's wife is feeling awful about how you're feeling.

It doesn't seem like there was maliciousness in the words described but merely that they bothered OP. Which is completely reasonable.

I don't think anyone is an asshole here but just need to sit down and talk.", "Thank you. And it really is tacky.", "The issue is my dad told my stepmom and my siblings that I was upset by what he said. He told them I disliked that he labelled my mom as one of the meaningless women from his past. He was married to her when she died, they had me together. He wouldn't have me if it wasn't for that meaningless relationship. And he tells that to a room full of people of which I was one of said people.

I never approach him with this. But he tells them anyway and then my siblings are upset with me because they think I should be fine with it. They can't understand what it's like to miss out on knowing your mom and to hear your dad basically say it was all one big nothing.", "Wow, so hearing your dad state that everyone before his current wife was a wrong choice or a mistake was not malicious? Sure sounds that way to me.", "With the added context here I think even more that you are trying to handle it the best way you probably can.  I hope it works out and everyone gets back to comfortable with each other! I'm sorry what your dad said bothered you and genuinely hope yall get to work through!", "I think the problem is my dad still doesn't see why his words bothered me. And I'm not sure he will. If he can't, this really isn't fixable because I will always be the the meaningless wrong choice. He can say that he never said that about me specifically. But he basically said his past relationships shouldn't have happened. Without his first marriage he doesn't have me. I even said that to him and he still insisted it shouldn't matter that he said that about his other relationships.", "Yea that's wild and has to make you feel like crap. I'm just sad your dad can't see why it upset you even if his intent was to uplift his current wife the backlash is clearly there for you."]}
