Your sister is being unreasonable.  You\u2019ve kept one sentimental memento that is important to you.  You\u2019ve been generous and donated everything else you could.

I donated or gave away most of his things (or let them be used for my husband\u2019s dog), but there are a few things that were important to me, so I kept them.

We have so many that we rotate them (we're a cage-free facility, so the rooms are big!) just so we don't have to try to navigate a carpet of toys.\n\nYour keeping something (anything, everything!) from your beloved fur kid doesn't deprive any other kitty of snuggly things and toys-- I promise.\n\n Thank you for thinking of the kitties in your community!
