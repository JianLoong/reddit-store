It's *your* item, your gift to your beloved cat.  It holds tremendous sentimental value to you, because it was such a great source of joy and comfort in your beloved cat's life.  And now it's a source of comfort to you.  You hold onto that toy.  In fact, should you ever love another cat, you can *still* keep the toy for yourself and get a different toy for your little friend if that's what you're most comfortable with.\n\nYour sister's behavior is bizarre and cold.  Don't listen to her.", "NTA. Your sister is overstepping. Loss is so so painful and if keeping the toy helps you (as it would for me and others), then do it. She should not be guilting you and she needs to mind her own business frankly.", "I really can't believe anyone could get worked up over a well-used and well-loved cat toy, but apparently your sister can.\n\nNTA. It's entirely reasonable to want to keep a memento, and it's not as though cat toys are super rare, expensive, or unique if you (or she!) want to donate one in your cat's memory either.", "NTA\n\nWhy does it matter to your sister if you keep one toy? That's such a weird thing for her to get hung up on.", "NTA.  Really none of your AH sister's business.", "NTA, please keep the toy. Sorry for your loss, sug.", "NTA..Its completely fine to Keep something to remember your cat", "NTA at all. It's not a toy. It's a keepsake of a special relationship.", "NTA\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with keeping a memento. I'm sorry for your loss", "NTA", "NTA. You grieve your way, you can keep it as long as you need/want. \nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm sure the shelter has plenty of toys and does not need your precious memento. Your sister needs to chill.", "omg NTA. How insensitive of her. Clearly she's never suffered a loss and wanted to keep something that brings back memories of that person/pet. That toy is something more for you than \"just a cat toy collecting dust\"", "NTA.  Your sister is being unreasonable.  You\u2019ve kept one sentimental memento that is important to you.  You\u2019ve been generous and donated everything else you could.  Sure there isn\u2019t a cat using the toy, but it\u2019s performing an important duty to you!\n\nMy service dog passed almost 3 years ago.  I donated or gave away most of his things (or let them be used for my husband\u2019s dog), but there are a few things that were important to me, so I kept them.  The amount of added utility they would give someone else doesn\u2019t negate their importance to me.", "NTA. You're not really supposed to donate \"intimate\" items that have the cat's scent on them anyway--some cats would find that stressful. But, regardless, it's very reasonable for you to want to keep it.", "NTA\n\nI work at a cat shelter, and we love getting donations from our friends and supporters-- we don't love the \"my kitty passed away\" phone call that usually comes before those gifts. We are lucky enough to get toys and catnip and all sorts of kitty things from Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, random other charities, schools, kitty lovers and visitors who just like our shelter. We have so many that we rotate them (we're a cage-free facility, so the rooms are big!) just so we don't have to try to navigate a carpet of toys.\n\nYour keeping something (anything, everything!) from your beloved fur kid doesn't deprive any other kitty of snuggly things and toys-- I promise.\n\n Thank you for thinking of the kitties in your community! I hope your heart eases and you find comfort in the bright, happy memories of your cat! <3", "NTA and the hell with your extremely insensitive sister!", "NTA. I kept one of my dog\u2019s squeaky toy, after she passed. It was well loved. It sits on my bookshelf beside a picture of her. She\u2019s been gone 3+ years now.", "NTA your sister is wrong.", "NTA! When a pet of mine passes away I keep it\u2019s collar bc it\u2019s sentimental and a small piece of the love I have for them remaining. Your sister clearly needs some empathy clearly, keep the toy but since she\u2019s weird about it maybe don\u2019t leave it where she can access ut", "NTA. Why is your sister getting so worked up about you keeping this toy? \"Get a life, sis.\"", "NTA. After my cat passed away, I donated everything but her personalised food bowl. It's a comforting reminder of her. You're not selfish for wanting that.", "NTA keeping one thing is not selfish. You were very generous to donate the food and other toys etc. Your heart is still aching, keeping one item to comfort you is not selfish.", "NTA.", "NTA. What is your sisters problem? She is an insensitive jerk and should mind her own business.", "Is this Marxism for cats?  WTF?

We have no intention of donating them. It\u2019s our memories of her and your sister is a jerk.", "NTA, it's your way of mourning. There's nothing wrong with keeping something (or even several somethings) to help remember a loved one. It's not like you saved everything and it's taking up an entire closet you need. Keep the toy, enjoy the memories.", "nta that\u2019s jus dum", "NTA. My missing cat just came home today and I\u2019m just furious at your sister suggesting that", "I\u2019ll bet your sister still owns her previous smart phone, locked away and collecting dust. Ask her why she doesn\u2019t donate it. Mock her for wanting to keep it so she can cherish the memories of the pictures stored on it. \n\nThen tell her she\u2019s an asshole and to mind her own business about your grieving process. Sorry for your loss. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nBut is it possible that your sister is just uncomfortable with you having \u201cfeelings\u201d about your bereavement & just wants to to stop!\n\nGetting rid of the memento might be (unconscious) code for her, where she\u2019s really saying \u201cstop making me feel bad because you have sad feelings\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not a great explanation -  but it might explain a little.", "NTA. I still have a little stuffed bison that my first cat loved. He crossed over 5 years ago. My wife has a little blanket thing from a beloved pet that crossed over in 2009. Keepsakes are always ok. Would she tell you to get rid of a child\u2019s favorite toy if the worst happened?", "NTA \n\nI lost my 20 year old cat  in October 2021and my 19.5 year old cat this past May. I kept their favorite toys and blanket. I am not getting rid of them. That and their ashes is  what I have left of them. Those items bring me immense comfort.", "NTA. My kitten loved his late older brother's dog toys and still brings me them to play fetch or toss about like cats are wont to do. \n\nSorry for you loss too. My guy left me six years ago next week and it still feels good (comforting?) to find his fur on things, see his cat brother go to town on a felt animal and know he is with us in personality, energy and the kind of constant shedding only a lab mix could offer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
