Grieve in peace", "NTA\n\nYou deserve something sentimental to remember your dead cat by. Your cat died and you are grieving. Tell your sister to back off.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why people get it into their heads that if you\u2019re giving something to charity you have to give \u2018everything\u2019 otherwise it\u2019s selfish??? You already did a good act, it\u2019s more that they had before, and you\u2019re most certainly allowed a momento of your family member.", "Keep your baby\u2019s toy. You\u2019ve got nothing to feel ashamed or guilty about. It\u2019s a sweet way to remember them by and the sentimental value is huge.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIf she is so worried about it collecting dust tell her you are going to make it into a key chain if it\u2019s small enough", "I still have two of my previous dog's toys. She's been dead for 6 years. Our new dog is three years old. He has his own toys. These things are part of the relationship you had with your cat. If you want to keep them and let it gather dust, that is what they should do. If it is selfish, be selfish.", "Sis, it's called sentimental. Her opinion about your cat toy is irrelevant. I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's pretty weird of your sister to claim you're selfish for keeping one item when you donated everything else.", "NTA. I just lost a cat and I wish I had a toy to remember him by (He wasn't a toy kind of cat). How you grieve is YOUR business and only yours. Remember your cat how you see fit. \nI'm so sorry for your loss", "NTA\n\nCats play woth everything. Laundry pin? Toy. Cork? Toy. Crumpled piece of paper? Toy.\nKeep it without a grain of guilt.", "NTA - I am so sorry for your loss. You hold on to the toy for as long as you need to. You are allowed to keep a rememberance of her. Your sister has no say in this matter as the item isn't hers to decide the disposition of. Please don't let her bully you into separating from something that is helping your grieving process.", "If sister is so conserned she can go buy a pack of three toy mice for like one dollar. They would even entertain two more cats than your one toy could.\n\nNTA", "You are absolutely NTA for having feelings", "NTA your sister is really wierd...", "[removed]", "Egads!  Your sister needs to step down. I worked in a shelter for years, trust me, one toy is not going to make or break anything.  If she feels that strongly about it, SHE can buy toys or make a donation.\n\nPlease keep the toy.  And maybe make a donation in your cat\u2019s name, or spend some time volunteering in her honor.  Or have a small fundraiser.  THESE things will make a difference to shelter animals while honoring your cat\u2019s memory, not one toy.  I had to say goodbye to my heart kitty of 18 years last year, and i understand the bond you had with your cat.  Sending hugs \n\nNTA", "NTA\nBuy the shelter cats a new toy. Keep the plushy.\nI'm sorry for the loss of your lovely cat.", "NTA! Its completely reasonable to keep a memento of a beloved pet. It's an important part of grief. It was generous of you to donate so many things following the death of your cat. Ignore your sister and her judgement, she has no place here. I'm really sorry for your loss OP.", "NTA and your sister needs to mind her own business. Sorry about your kitty.", "NTA. You have every right to have a keepsake to memorialize your long-term companionship with your cat.\n\nAs your sister is not the bereaved party, she doesn't get a say in the matter. Ignore her two cents and do what is right for you.", "NTA. Tell your sister she's more than welcome to do a massive thrift run for cat toys, since she's so very, very concerned", "NTA, and you need to stop telling your sister anything, because she will simply seize it as an opportunity to call you names and attack. People like your sister always feel good about themselves when they find a victim. They need at least one a day, like a vampire.\n\nOf course you have a right to save a souvenir of your cat--though you don't need a reason. It's your property. Tell your sister to mind her own business.", "Absolutely NTA. My dog passed away in 2015 and I still have most of his things, including his blankets and his favorite stuffed penguin toy.

Tell her if she's so worried about the cats in the shelter she can buy them a toy.", "NTA in the slightest. Our dog passed away in March and we have kept 3 or 4 of her favourite toys, along with her favourite blankets and beanbag.", "Glad you were able to answer that without breaking the rules, becuse my first thoughts definitely would have, lol.", "I\u2019ve got my dogs collar and favourite cuddly three years on. Don\u2019t let people tell you how to grieve.", "What an amazingly wonderful long life they both had with you!

Make sure your sister can't get to the toy, or she will give it away behind your back. So sorry for your loss, its perfectly okay to keep sentimental items to remind you of loved ones and pets count just as much as people", "My cat's toys are still laying on his bed where he last left them.

Sending you comforting thoughts.", "NTA x 100000000000. How ridiculous. We lost our family cat in January and all her stuff is still about because I can't bring myself to look at it, let alone give it away. There's an open bag of dreamies right behind me on the headboard of our bed at this very moment.\nKeep that toy, but yeah, hide it from your sister.", "NTA. Cats will play with literally anything; mine is particularly fond of tissue paper, shoelaces, and sweet wrappers. They will not be short of entertainment because you kept one toy that had sentimental value.", "NTA. I still have my dogs food dishes after all, so it's not wrong to keep something to remember a loved pet by. I also have toys from my last cat and I will still keep a couple of toys after my current cat passes.", "Why is you sister this offended and mad about this? Seriously what\u2019s wrong with her? Nta", "Ignore your sister. I still have my dog\u2019s favourite chewing ring. It\u2019s the only one that he didn\u2019t demolish. It hangs up in the garden on a hook.

If that makes us selfish so fucking be it. (It doesn\u2019t by the way, your sister is an AH)", "Absolutely not! I still have my doggies favorite bow tie, neckerchief and his favourite toy, I'd never donate them because I have them to remember that though he's not running around with me anymore he's still here with me. I'll do the same for all my furbabies! \n\nThere's no way you're being selfish, you're keeping something personal, the same way people keep something to remember human family and friends.\n\nI've kept my Dad's favourite fleece blanket and nobody says that's selfish because they see that as important, so I think it's just as important to keep a favourite toy from a loved kitty.", "NTA it's really kind of you that you've donated all the other stuff, it's perfectly fine to keep one special thing to remember your cat by.\n\n\nOn top of that, in my country thrift stores have an unlimited supply of plush toys. People keep buying new ones, nobody wants a second hand one (they have so many you can get them for free, we use those for our dog). So there are probably enough other options to get the pets in shelters some plush toys. You don't have to feel guilty about it.", "NTA at all.", "We have 2 golden retrievers and when the eldest one passed 2 years ago we kept back his one favourite toy (among the many they both had) and his food bowl with his name on\n\nWe've now got a pup alongside the other, so we are back up to 2 golden retrievers.\n\nBut that one toy is kept apart\n\n(A black one legged raven plushy from the tower of london, repaired and sewn together so many times because he would carry it everywhere)\n\nNTA", "no. i donated all my cat\u2019s food, litter, medication. just an insane amount of stuff. but I still have his little taco toy. and i buried him with his favorite blanket. \n\nOP, you\u2019ve done more than enough. you can absolutely keep remembrances.

I have some\u2026.*opinions* about OP\u2019s sister.", "When my dog passed away, we kept her favourite toy in a safe spot, despite having another dog who would have happily played with it. It's safely tucked away with her collar and a picture of her, and it's a lovely reminder of her. Keep your kitty's toy safe, and cherish the happy memories it brings."]}
