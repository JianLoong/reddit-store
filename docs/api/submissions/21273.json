She responded saying that she wears a set of gym clothes twice before giving them a wash, I was a bit taken aback and asked her why she does that and she says that it's very common amongst gym goers and some fitness influencers she follows on Instagram.\n\nNow, I've been noticing this about her over the last few months that she doesn't shower everyday, which is totally fine, but she also sometimes doesn't shower after very intense workouts and I have been able to smell that, so it's not just about sweaty gym clothes. Very recently I also noticed that she doesn't change her underwear over a couple of days, including after working out. Now all of this is concerning me because IMO what she's doing is not very hygienic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo back to the original conversation, I mentioned that I noticed she doesn't shower after working out sometimes and I asked her if that could be the reason for her smelling like sweat. Now she broke into a rant about how I was rude to her about this and that I'm being like a parent talking about smelly gym clothes and hygiene. She says that I ruined her excitement about her gains and was very excited about going to the gym today and that now I've totally ruined it for her. She also said that it's really rude for a boyfriend to talk to his girlfriend about her hygiene and that it's extremely uncomfortable. I ended up apologizing to her. I now feel like I may have unrealistic standards of hygiene and that I'm in the wrong here, but I don't know. AITA?  \n\n\nETA: Thank you for all your comments so far, I really appreciate it. So she got back from the gym and told me that she's really hurt by what I said. She says that there are some things that a person just doesn't tell their partner in a relationship, and that includes things related to hygiene.

If you cannot tell your partner something related to their hygiene to help them out then.... \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I expect him to do the same to me because I'm very self conscious about smelling or anything hygiene related (I have really good hygiene, but sometimes you don't notice your own smell or whatever lol) and I'd rather my husband say it than have a stranger think it, you know lol\n\nNTA. Also not changing undergarments several days in a row is super bad for your health... The discharge and moisture buildup on the underwear throughout the day provides for an excellent breeding ground for bacteria, yeast, and fungi that are often contaminated with faecal and urine matter. \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\nOne day some super bold stranger is going to tell her (or say to someone else loud enough for her to hear) that she stinks and that will hurt her feelings more than whatever you've said. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2c", "Thinking of the bed sheets, mattress and blankets, the couch , dining chairs, car seat. Big NO.  I was originally going to suggest when she asks how she looks in gym gear, go Very interested and say u want to examine every inch.... pick her up and carry to shower.. get in with her. Make a big playful thing of washing her , clothes on, removing 1 article of clothing at a time.  .. voila, shes clean, clothes are wet, she cant wear them again. Shes happy you desire her.. everyones happy.. but not sure how many times this scenario can work.....", "Even I, who usually shower at most twice a week, change underwear every day and shower after a workout/heavy sweat. Granted, I don't usually work out but I do shower more in summer as a natural result of the sweatyness.\n\nHowever, when someone points out something like this, it's highly sensitive. Insecurities stemming from childhood and not feeling attractive enough could be at play here. Also, mental health issues. Tread lightly on this subject. Apologize to her. Explain that you didn't want to hurt her and that you don't really care about the smell. Then ask her what she thinks is reasonable, tell her your view, if it's incompatible you might just either have to suck it up, or go your separate ways. Do NOT pressure her to shower more.\n\nNAH", "NTA.\nI think you did it in a really nice way and she needs to wake up. Not showering every day can be okay, if you're not doing anything to get super dirty... however changing clothes, including underwear is completely neccesary. Is there something stopping her? Mentally?", "If you can smell it, so can everyone around her. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH at all. A relationship should be a space where you can discuss things such as this in a neutral environment and grow. She\u2019s choosing to victimize herself rather than accepting that, yeah, she could do better instead of remaining stinky. Would she prefer this come from a stranger?", "NTA Your girlfriend has so much pride that she literally stinks. \n\nMy husband tells me when my deodorant doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019d rather know before I go hug someone while reeking of body odor. He usually tells me I smell good so it\u2019s nice to know he\u2019s being honest.", "NTA. And of course this is something that someone should talk about to their partner. She\u2019s just embarrassed but she need yo hear it in order to get it as make a change.", "NTA. Your girl is gross. \n\nI shower every morning after the gym but my hair girl gets on my butt about only washing my hair every other day. I rinse it but i still think it's gross. I don't want to smell and have no issue asking my hubby for sniff approval. Isn't that what your significant other is for?", "Thank you for saying this. The contortions my face made were disturbing. This behavior is very disturbing in a grownup individual. I\u2019m wondering if this individual has any mental health issues that are not being addressed.", "Haha same. I read your comment and my nose was still screwed up!", "Thank you for saying this. The contortions my face made were disturbing. This behavior is very disturbing in a grownup individual. I\u2019m wondering if this individual has any mental health issues that are not being addressed.", "Thank you for your response. I edited my post to add what she said after she got back home. She says I've hurt her feelings and that I should not be keeping such things to myself instead hurting the other person. Reading all the comments makes me feel otherwise.", "Was the \u201cwho changes his underwear EVERY day\u201d part sarcastic???", "My chest and back would break out in a SECOND if I didn\u2019t shower after the gym. Jealous that some ppl can get away with that and only smell bad but ew", "NTA - I agree, this is just gross. I can\u2019t even imagine how bad someone would smell using the same gym clothes and not showering. What the hell kind of influences is she watching?!", "About what you said about changing underwear........", "Plus, the materials workout clothes are made of usually are synthetic which actually tends to smell worse than natural materials when you sweat and should be washed after every workout especially intense ones.", "Yeah wth does she mean you don\u2019t bring this up with someone you\u2019re in a relationship with? Like, the person you have sex with?", "Exactly. My friends and family BETTER tell me if I'm stinky (breath or body) - don't let me go out in the world like that. So far it hasn't  happened yet, but my family well tell me if I got a bat in the cave, or something in my teeth, so they better tell me if I smell. I once caught a wiff of my underarms when I was showering, after having been trapped somewhere with no air conditioning for several hours, and I accused of everybody in my house of not telling me my pits were stinky. And they were all like, 'Nobody could smell your pits because your arms are not raised, you walked into the room, stood over 10 ft away chatting for 5 minutes - and you literally JUST got home 20 minutes ago.\" I was still mad.", "Sorry for the (maybe silly) question - not a native speaker: \n\nis body odor = sweat?\n\n\nBecause people have their own smell without any Parfum, deodorant, soap smell what so ever, it's just what they smell like (not like sweat) - isn't that also body odor or is the connotation of body odor always \"bad\"/\"sweaty\" etc.?", "And grime too.", "More like  smells like fiction.", "I think he should also expect that stinky gym clothes should go into the laundry basket, not back on her body. Rewearing stinky clothes is disgusting.", "OP never said that it does not stink, he specifically stated, she wears the SAME clothes for MULTIPLE workout without washing them or changing clothes... Thats unhygenic.", "The smell is bacteria. They need washed. Full stop. That\u2019s nasty.", "Before a workout?", "Shutchoooo dumbass up \ud83d\ude02, I\u2019ve read plenty of stupid shit and this can go on the pile.", "The only sensible response in the whole comments.", "Username checks out", "One of my best friends realized her depression was uncontrolled when she realized it\u2019d been 6 days since she\u2019d showered or gotten out of the same pajamas/undies (she works from home). It was the wake-up call she needed to seek help.", "My face got a workout too!", "Same here except it was my chin that kind of retracted into my face with bulging WTF eyes! \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019ve left guys over them smelling like BO all the time. Also how is she not embarrassed \ud83d\udc80 if someone told me that I would be mortified and apologize", "That's insane. If I smelled bad, I would want someone to tell me. Sure, it would be embarrassing. But that's better than someone not wanting to be around me because my presence could curdle milk and peel paint off a wall. I'm also an avid runner and gym goer. I always shower after every run or workout and my underwear certainly gets changed. That's basic hygiene. Your girlfriend is behaving like a stinky child.", "Role reversal!\n\nWould you rather know your partner potentially avoids intimate contact because you're a bit... ripe. Or would you prefer they kept it to themselves? (pun intended)\n\nShe is probably embarrassed, which is natural. I mean it's pretty difficult to smell yourself.", "How do you get intimate with someone who has poor hygiene?", "As her partner you are the first person who should be letting her know that this is not hygienic. Perhaps lead her to this discussion, she'll be grumpy with you for a few days but then she will be smelling sweet, definitely worth it I reckon!", "So are you still going to be with her?", "Why not compromise? You keep your thoughts to herself and she keeps her smells to herself.", "She is going to be even more embarrassed when her boss has to pull her aside for her BO. If you can smell it, everyone can. Please try to find a way to acknowledge that you understand she is embarrassed but you didn't say it to hurt her feelings, you are concerned for her health and that you wanted to help her avoid embarrassment in other locations, like at work. Good luck mate.", "I'm hoping so ugh lol", "Ofc it was. Its just gross.", "Especially with women\u2019s underwear and workout shorts/leggings; if she doesn\u2019t wash, air her downstairs out, and change her clothes she could give herself an infection \n\nAnd some people\u2019s vaginas just don\u2019t like synthetic clothing and can only tolerate cotton. If that\u2019s the case for her, she probably wouldn\u2019t even realize it.", "I\u2019d be pissed if my partner didn\u2019t tell me if I was smelly! \u201cYOU LET ME GO OUT LIKE THIS??\u201d \n\nAlso what influencers is she following? Sounds very niche", "People shouldn't have a smell that you can detect from a short, but not intimate, distance away. He means sweat though.", "You two nasty twats should hang out with your stankin selves.", "I think she'd rather he just pretend nothing's wrong and accept the UTI with quiet dignity", "uh, i'd rather have my partner politely be like, \"babe... idk how to say this, but you're a bit ripe. i noticed you don't shower after a workout and i wanted to check in\" so i could properly, YES, be mortified, but ultimately grateful thay i'm not going around smelling bad and pickin up yeast infections and UTIs like they're on sale. c'mon lol, of course it's difficult and embarrassing, but it's not at all unwarranted!", "Also your skin cells + the sweat and dust on them all shed. If she goes to bed without being clean, she\u2019s transferring her nastiness onto their sheets", "Oh good. I was concerned"]}
