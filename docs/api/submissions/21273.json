She responded saying that she wears a set of gym clothes twice before giving them a wash, I was a bit taken aback and asked her why she does that and she says that it's very common amongst gym goers and some fitness influencers she follows on Instagram.\n\nNow, I've been noticing this about her over the last few months that she doesn't shower everyday, which is totally fine, but she also sometimes doesn't shower after very intense workouts and I have been able to smell that, so it's not just about sweaty gym clothes. Very recently I also noticed that she doesn't change her underwear over a couple of days, including after working out. Now all of this is concerning me because IMO what she's doing is not very hygienic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo back to the original conversation, I mentioned that I noticed she doesn't shower after working out sometimes and I asked her if that could be the reason for her smelling like sweat. Now she broke into a rant about how I was rude to her about this and that I'm being like a parent talking about smelly gym clothes and hygiene. She says that I ruined her excitement about her gains and was very excited about going to the gym today and that now I've totally ruined it for her. She also said that it's really rude for a boyfriend to talk to his girlfriend about her hygiene and that it's extremely uncomfortable. I ended up apologizing to her. I now feel like I may have unrealistic standards of hygiene and that I'm in the wrong here, but I don't know. AITA?  \n\n\nETA: Thank you for all your comments so far, I really appreciate it. So she got back from the gym and told me that she's really hurt by what I said. She says that there are some things that a person just doesn't tell their partner in a relationship, and that includes things related to hygiene.

There\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about. But then again, she doesn\u2019t even change panties so\u2026..\n\nNTA - OP, as a woman I would want my partner to tell me if I\u2019m stankin. Your gf sounds immature. Based on not only her hygiene practices but her childish response to it, I\u2019d be seriously reconsidering the whole relationship. She\u2019s gross. Even if she\u2019s one of those people that handles serious conversations badly, you were very polite about the way you tried telling her. I\u2019d understand if she came back from the gym ready to talk about it but instead she doubled down on her nastiness. I wouldn\u2019t even want her in my bed, let alone be intimate with her. Throw the whole girl away.", "I\u2019m not afraid to sniff my arm pit if I feel like I may be a little ripe. Shoo! I was sitting on the edge of the pool yesterday beside my mom. It was so hot I was melting. I lifted my arm to adjust my hat and I smelled funny. I apologized and scooted away from my mom so she didn\u2019t have to smell it. I couldn\u2019t help that I\u2019d sweat through my D.O., but I wasn\u2019t about to make my mom suffer. \ud83d\ude02", "You can absolutely get used to your own smell, that\u2019s also why some people use way too much perfume. But that\u2019s why I a) clean myself every day regardless and b) expect that my boyfriend points out if it\u2019s not enough!", "The hair I can understand because washing it too often dries out the skin and ends up producing more oil to compensate\u2026 thus getting greasier hair faster and more regularly.\n\nBut the rest of the body? There\u2019s no excuse for that. That\u2019s just gross and unhygienic.", "me too lol. I thought these things are universally known, change your underwear every day unless you're living in the Arctic or somewhere else that makes it hard to do so or where water is scarce and you need to ration it.", "I said she doesn't require being sterile. How could you fail to understand that", "I can too. Each person is different. I personally can\u2019t skip washing my hair, and it isn\u2019t because I wash it everyday. I could quit washing it so often and it would still be gross on the second day. That\u2019s just me though. People need to know themselves and if they don\u2019t, they need to be open to feedback."]}
