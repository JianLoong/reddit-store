She responded saying that she wears a set of gym clothes twice before giving them a wash, I was a bit taken aback and asked her why she does that and she says that it's very common amongst gym goers and some fitness influencers she follows on Instagram.\n\nNow, I've been noticing this about her over the last few months that she doesn't shower everyday, which is totally fine, but she also sometimes doesn't shower after very intense workouts and I have been able to smell that, so it's not just about sweaty gym clothes. Very recently I also noticed that she doesn't change her underwear over a couple of days, including after working out. Now all of this is concerning me because IMO what she's doing is not very hygienic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo back to the original conversation, I mentioned that I noticed she doesn't shower after working out sometimes and I asked her if that could be the reason for her smelling like sweat. Now she broke into a rant about how I was rude to her about this and that I'm being like a parent talking about smelly gym clothes and hygiene. She says that I ruined her excitement about her gains and was very excited about going to the gym today and that now I've totally ruined it for her. She also said that it's really rude for a boyfriend to talk to his girlfriend about her hygiene and that it's extremely uncomfortable. I ended up apologizing to her. I now feel like I may have unrealistic standards of hygiene and that I'm in the wrong here, but I don't know. AITA?  \n\n\nETA: Thank you for all your comments so far, I really appreciate it. So she got back from the gym and told me that she's really hurt by what I said. She says that there are some things that a person just doesn't tell their partner in a relationship, and that includes things related to hygiene.

She mentioned Instagram, maybe she is getting influenced by it more than she realises, its full of bs after all.\n\nAlso, if you disagree with your partner over something and she says she got her feelings hurt you should acknowledge that, apologise and ask her why what you said hurt her which you did, great, try to understand it from her perspective and voice that understanding. What you should not do is back down if you do not think what you said was not wrong/harmful. After making sure you listened to her defend your statement, give her your reasons, that you would expect her to tell you if you were smelly etc. Make sure to talk calmly, take few seconds to think of what to say before replying. It's not a win loss situation but setting up boundaries as to what you are comfortable with in a relationship and what you are not.

At most, I would apologise that her feelings were hurt as that was not your intention  but clarify that while she's upset that you \"ruined her excitement\" about her gains, her neglecting to bathe, especially after working out is ruining your attraction to her and while you won't parent her hygiene and laundry, you also have the right to not endure gross habits that she is able to control.
