It was *wildly* inappropriate for him to be getting off on these sneaky little conversations with you (and he absolutely was) and making his wife part of the fantasy without her knowledge or consent. The fact that he was actively encouraging you to pursue her sexually is *beyond* creepy and exploitative. Doing this with the wrong man is likely to end in sexual assault. \n\n\nAnd now you know it\u2019s not the first time. He\u2019s rewriting history because it\u2019s his only defense - he has to pretend he was doing something different than what he was actually doing, because *he knows* that what he was *actually* doing was so very wrong. Even if his version of events was accurate, sharing detailed sexual fantasies involving you and his wife with you is in extremely iffy territory. His wife has very good reason to be pissed, and if his marriage ends because of this, it\u2019s on him. Completely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
