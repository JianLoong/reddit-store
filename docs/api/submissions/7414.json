My BF and I live a few streets away from one of his friends who I'll call J (30F) and her girlfriend, M (30F) and we go over to each other's houses often to play games and have a few drinks and it is always a good time. \n\nJ and M have been struggling a bit financially recently and were needing some new furniture to replace stuff that had broken or needed replacing and we had recently got a lot of new furniture so we gave the items that were in really good condition to them. Despite having a large car (a lot larger than mine), J told us M couldn't fit the furniture in her car and asked if we could arrange for the furniture to be taken to them. I asked my BF's mum if she could help and she did and I was speaking to J to arrange a date and time to drop it all off but J was being difficult and the process was dragged out as we had to fit it around ours and my BF's mum's work and the days we offered J refused as her and M wanted to chill after working (they work from home). \n\nWe finally got a date settled and me, my BF and my BF's mum loaded the car but due to my BF needing to get ready for work and not enough room in the car for us all, I went with my BF's mum to drop the furniture off. I let J know we were coming and she responded so I knew she had seen it. We got there and I knocked on and after some time, J answered. We started unloading the car and J didn't come out of the house to help at all and M didn't evern come downstairs to help. As BF's Mum and I were carrying in a sofa, my BF's mum slipped and fell. I helped her up and luckily she was OK, but J did not even flinch and just stood there again. No asking if she was OK or offer to help. I was dumbfounded and shocked so I just got the sofa in the house and we left.\n\nWhen I got home, I told my BF what happened and he spoke to his mum and asked if she was OK and he was equally shocked, but he did not say anything to J about it. Since then, I have refused to go to speak to J and M and when we have gotten rid of more furniture, I have refused to ask J and M despite my BF's request and I have made it clear to my BF that I am not helping J and M again and that he should get a spine and call them out on their behaviour. AITA? It is effecting my BF's friendship with them and I feel bad as they are struggling, but I also don't see why I should help when they can't be bothered to make andm effort themselves and showed no respect to his mum when she was doing them the favour.", "created_utc": 1673793439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cldf3/aita_for_refusing_to_speak_to_and_help_out_my/", "score": 227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When she asked you to bring it over is the moment I would have quit. Let alone making his mum lug a free couch *for them*.\n\nYour bf is also TA for not prioritizing his mother over his friends.", "NTA, but there is something wrong with your bf. He is missing a spine. This does not augur well for you- what happens when they turn on you? Do you think he will stand up for you?? He is a jellyfish, or there is something wrong in their relationship.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t have even delivered the furniture. If they can\u2019t be proactive for free furniture and be helpful then screw them. And then to not even help unload at all then not be concerned for him mom???!!!\nThey are the biggest assholes ever.", "NTA- you helped these people, which is extremely nice and you wouldn't have to do that, you even planned everything while it looks like they didn't even bother organising or helping. \nFirstly they don't appreciate the huge favor you are doing them and act as if they are entitled to it. Secondly, when they see someone getting hurt while HELPING them and doing THEIR job, they don't even bother asking if she is okay? That's extremly rude and disrespectful. You are doing the right thing by not talking to them. I would say go even further- these people are not your friends- get your stuff back. They don't derserve this. \nAlso i don't understand why bf wants to stay friends with these people. Maybe talk everything through with him, make a list. Go NC with J and M forever, you don't need people like that in your life.", "NTA. But I you should tell them you\u2019re disappointed, not helping them in the future, and why. Do you both avoid confrontation? I don\u2019t think this is a friendship killing situation, but I do think it\u2019s a reevaluate some boundaries and expectations situation.", "NTA. Even the fact that they did not arrange the transportation is very entitled. And then to make the scheduling hard and NOT to help moving things in. They are beyond entitled. You guys were even too accommodating. You should have offered the furniture only on condition they get it out of your house and to their place.", "r/EntitledPeople", "Soft (very soft) YTA. The reason being, you're expecting someone who wasn't there to say something. Why don't you say something yourself?\n\nOtherwise, you're free to choose who you do and don't speak with.

If BF wants to give other things to J and M, he could do the logistics himself.   I wouldn't force BF to confront them since it sounds like you all 4 were friends.    You may be less inclined to go visit, which is understandable, but you don't have to go.  Happy BF mom is OK.", "J and M sound exhausting. When people help you during a tough time it\u2019s not appropriate to let pride, depression or bad manners interfere with making the assistance go as smoothly as possible.

Have you heard of r/ChoosingBeggars? M and J aren't just disrespectful of your BFs mum. They are also disrespectful of you and your boyfriend.

I honestly can't believe how they all behave. You were trying to help them out and they just acted like they were the ones doing you the favor of taking that furniture off of your hands. It's ridiculous that they didn't help your bfs mom or even bother to ask if she was ok. If that was me I would have put that furniture back in the car and left. It's just crazy to think that your bf didn't seem to care that they did that to his own mom makes you really think that he cares more about what J and M think then to stand up to them for how they been acting. I also wouldn't want anything to do with them either.", "NTA but i would have told them both to come and help or don't take it at all!! i can't ever imagine behaving this way! your actions need to have consequences and they have a free sofa and not much of a consequence to their behaviour!", "NTA. These two women do not have the right to act like jerks just because they're struggling financially. If someone is doing you a favor, especially one as nice and big as this, you should bend over backwards to make everything as painless and easy as possible for the person doing you the favor.", "NTA. They did nothing to help at all. I wouldn't have even taken it in if they didn't come and unload it themselves.", "I just want to ask, is jellyfish a translation from another language in this case? Never seen it in this context, but I'm not a native English speaker so it could be that.", "This - if someone getting something for nothing can\u2019t be bothered to make any steps towards getting said stuff to their own place then they had better have a stunning reason - you know in a wheelchair, pregnant, caring for tiny kids, very ill.", "Maybe they did think they were doing BF and OP a favor. They are still AH for their callousness. NTA", "Jellyfish don't have bones therefore have no spines."]}
