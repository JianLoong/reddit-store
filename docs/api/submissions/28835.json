They are now between the ages of 10 and 15.\n\nI love my stepkids. I have always loved being their stepmom even though they don't want a close relationship with me. They seem to feel like it would be disloyal to their mom and that their maternal family would be hurt if they were very close to me. It's something I tried not to take personally and I accepted it and embraced that I would probably only be \"dad's wife\" and not stepmom or grandma in the future when they have grandkids. I always thought at least we could have children together.

I'm already struggling to hold myself together. I was honest with my husband about it and I started therapy. He asked if I was considering leaving and I told him I needed to work through everything in therapy but that it was possible. He asked if there was anything he could do. I said no. We had talked about the costs of fertility treatments and it's just not feasible with the kids we already have. And I think the mental torture of trying and if it doesn't work, which is the most likely outcome, it would be harder for me. I love my husband and I love the kids.

This is a great opportunity for you to enlist your husbands help. he needs to tell his parents to back off and that they are prying tooo much.  But if you have a loving, caring, devoted life partner in this man, then I'd think twice about leaving all of that just because you can't imagine that things may some day be different than they are right this minute.   What happens if you leave? Will you decide to live alone forever because your step children didn't attach to you the way you wanted? Will you look for another partner, but only one who doesn't want or have kids?  I wouldn't make any big decisions yet but husband can absolutely step in with his parents.

You're grieving a lot, so be aware that depression can develop alongside that.  I live with depression and when an episode occurs, it can really affect your perception of your life where negative thoughts stick and positive ones just slide off.

In a marriage people give a part of themselves to the other. They swear oaths to the other. That creates some duties.\n\nAnd to me, it seems pretty fucking cold to just blindly go into a marriage on the assumption that the kids will embrace you with full love for a parent, then *nope* right on out five years later when things don't play out that way as if it was this major dealbreaker you just sort of forgot to mention.", "I have a really amazing endocrinologist.

Suppose her child has severe issues and will never talk, let alone grow to have a 'normal' life, would she be happy taking care of the child?\n\nRight now, she is mourning the loss of her dream. She shouldn't make any sudden decisions because the grass isn't always greener on the other dide.", "Then maybe you didn\u2019t have the right therapist or stick with it long enough?\n\nBut either way it seems like an untenable situation as is for you. I\u2019m so sorry OP.", "That's why I am in therapy. I don't know if I can stay and be happy but I'll never know unless I work on things enough. Nothing is being rushed (except therapy, I started that immediately). But no big decision will be made just yet.", "That's why I started therapy. I want to be sure what is best before doing something.", "Not really, no. They are distant and really only communicate with my husband. I tried once or twice but even with him they are just very direct and only interested in communicating about seeing their grandchildren.", "I always dreamed of motherhood. As a kid I knew I wanted kids. I had this longing for this life where I was married and working and had two kids. As I grew older the desire for motherhood only grew stronger. I married my husband because I loved him but kids were a deal breaker for me. I would not have married him if he had said he wanted no more kids. We had no idea I would be the reason we couldn't. But at the time I wasn't facing the future of never having my love returned by a child I was raising. Now I am. But my husband has that love from his four kids. A love I don't believe I will ever come close to experiencing. \n\nI love my stepkids. I have always loved them. But the pain of their distance and lack of love is only worse now that I never get to know it from a child I can have.", "Before we got married the kids seemed to be more open to me. I won't say we were very close. But it felt like we were building toward a closer relationship which all seemed to shut down after the wedding. I think it made it more real for the older kids.", "Or the maternal family/other members of the extended family?", "Yes and my husband did try to bring us all closer together but they were resistant. We did therapy and that's how we found out they felt it would be disloyal to their mom and would probably hurt their maternal family for them to be close to me.", "I get that but I don't get the feeling OP will be happy if she runs away either. I feel like she will be sad and alone, and still feeling the pain of not having the life she dreamed of.", "How much does an adoption cost realistically? I know it's a lot but imagining myself in your husband's shoes I would probably consider some drastic financial moves / loans / in order to facilitate not losing my wife again. When he asked if there was anything he could do, could you at least give him the chance to come up with the money? \n\nHonestly, if I were you I would dedicate myself to trying to build up enough income to be able to eventually adopt. Much more manageable ambition than finding another person worth marrying plus you don't have to divorce someone you love to pursue it.", "I think being unhappy is better then being in constant pain. She can work on being happy but the pain could never go away.", "The concern would be my stepkids would not accept any child we foster. That makes our home automatically not suitable in the eyes of the system, which I understand.", "Yes, usually it\u2019s something like the home not having enough rooms or past criminal convictions. The first is something that can be potentially overcome. Very curious as to why fostering to adopt isn\u2019t an option.", "Realistically- an adoption is about $30,000-[$70,000](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/costs-of-adoptions.html#:~:text=Generally%2C%20for%20families%20adopting%20a,goes%20into%20a%20successful%20adoption.)  and up up front, depending on how you go about, and what happens throughout the process\n\n- Also if the mother at any point changes their mind that money is a \"gift\" you do not get it back, and you start the process over. \n\nPeople think adoption is the \"answer,\" for situations like this (and although it's great when you can do it) it's not always what people want,   always feasible. Adoption can be an emotional, and expensive process, that people cannot afford.", "She adores them. But they don\u2019t let her in. It\u2019s pretty hard to feel close under those circumstances.", "I adore them all. But I know they do not feel the same for me and I am not the person they come to.", "Sending so many Internet hugs. It sounds like you have a very loving, nurturing personality, and it hurts deeply to be unable to express that part of you the way you wanted to. Like longing to dance but having arthritic legs, or yearning to sing and discovering your vocal cords don't work ... it just ... sucks. I'm sorry.\n\nYou've done well to respect your stepchildren's boundaries, and I'm sorry that your inlaws (well meaning as they might be) haven't afforded you the same. I hope that you can find some relief soon.", "Have you considered adopting?", "What about the adoption of a baby or small kid?", "I would suggest adoption, especially if you decided to leave, adoption will be a great way to fill the hole, staying not very sure, as it might cause big dramas with kids and cause more problems for you and new kid,", "Would adoption be an option?", "Very much this. You also need to be prepared for it to take years and with my situation, the added concern could be a mother might not want her child placed in a home where it's not one united, loving family.", "Yes, there are multiple relationships like this in my family, where X calls their parent's spouse by their first name, but X's kids call that person grandma/grandpa. Not in every case with remarried parents, but some of them.", "I had a similar situation growing up. My maternal grandmother died when my mother was an infant. My grandfather remarried several years later, and my mother never considered her as anything more than her father\u2019s wife. To myself and my siblings she was our grandmother. She took care of us and loved us and she was our grandmother in every way.", "It's possible though I do not know that my stepkids would allow that kind of relationship for me with their future children. Loyalty to their mom would likely kick in again.", "Yes, but not an option for us as a couple.", "Foster care is not an option for us because social workers would be concerned a child would not be accepted by my stepkids. Infant adoption is very expensive so that's also out.", "Not for us as a couple. Too expensive to adopt via an agency and we are not eligible to foster because of concerns a child would not be accepted by my stepkids.", "Not for us as a couple. Too expensive to adopt via an agency and we are not eligible to foster because of concerns a child would not be accepted by my stepkids."]}
