My husband has four children from his first marriage. His late wife died while the children were all very young, two and a half years before we met. They are now between the ages of 10 and 15.\n\nI love my stepkids. I have always loved being their stepmom even though they don't want a close relationship with me. They seem to feel like it would be disloyal to their mom and that their maternal family would be hurt if they were very close to me. It's something I tried not to take personally and I accepted it and embraced that I would probably only be \"dad's wife\" and not stepmom or grandma in the future when they have grandkids. I always thought at least we could have children together. But now that dream has been taken and I don't know that I can be happy staying married.\n\nI, personally, would struggle to accept watching my husband have an amazing relationship with my stepkids while I don't and knowing I can't have that relationship with my child. I'm already struggling to hold myself together. I was honest with my husband about it and I started therapy. He asked if I was considering leaving and I told him I needed to work through everything in therapy but that it was possible. He asked if there was anything he could do. I said no. We had talked about the costs of fertility treatments and it's just not feasible with the kids we already have. And I think the mental torture of trying and if it doesn't work, which is the most likely outcome, it would be harder for me. I love my husband and I love the kids. But I don't think it would be enough for me. I don't think I am capable of being okay with being the outsider. With never hearing I love you from one of the kids knowing I will never hear it from a child I have raised.\n\nMy husband's parents are aware I am in therapy and they are aware we were given bad news about having a baby together. They have tried talking to me. But I can't find it in myself to open up the wound with them and tell them everything.

This is a great opportunity for you to enlist your husbands help. he needs to tell his parents to back off and that they are prying tooo much.  But if you have a loving, caring, devoted life partner in this man, then I'd think twice about leaving all of that just because you can't imagine that things may some day be different than they are right this minute.   What happens if you leave? Will you decide to live alone forever because your step children didn't attach to you the way you wanted? Will you look for another partner, but only one who doesn't want or have kids?  I wouldn't make any big decisions yet but husband can absolutely step in with his parents.

You're grieving a lot, so be aware that depression can develop alongside that.  I live with depression and when an episode occurs, it can really affect your perception of your life where negative thoughts stick and positive ones just slide off.

I don't think this is really about them being obnoxious about therapy.

In a marriage people give a part of themselves to the other. They swear oaths to the other. That creates some duties.\n\nAnd to me, it seems pretty fucking cold to just blindly go into a marriage on the assumption that the kids will embrace you with full love for a parent, then *nope* right on out five years later when things don't play out that way as if it was this major dealbreaker you just sort of forgot to mention.", "I have a really amazing endocrinologist.

Of course that doesn't mean the OP needs to tell them anything about their mental state or what's going on in therapy, but I think they're asking for reasons other than pure nosiness.", "Having kids was a deal breaker for me. Back when we were dating I told him if he didn't want more kids our relationship could not progress. He said of course he did. I had no idea I had fertility issues. I was okay with his kids not being close to me before. But now my dream of motherhood is gone and I have to watch him have a loving relationship with his kids and it kills me. It hurts.

It\u2019s a good message and it\u2019s applicable. Sometimes movies say more than people can. This will affect those kids and seeing the implications is not a bad thing, especially for the older one. Inevitably, if she leaves, there will be effects that they just don\u2019t see yet. Moreover on the husband.
