If she were 18 when you gave up then you would not be the asshole. But she is a child. You chose her dad which means you chose her. Be the adult and be there for her. Even if she is behaving like a child when she is almost an adult. When she turns 18 if you want to be petty feel free. That\u2019s between you and another adult. But she is a CHILD and has been. You chose her. Fight with your husband about this all you want. But it IS your job to be there for her. You took that on when you got married.", "NTA. Sometimes people have a certain personality and they justify it in situations like these (relationship with step mothers are always bad, because they're evil). The problem is, she is developing her personality in a very negative way because she can (\"everyone understands\" and doesn't correct her), but she will likely later do this to other people in her life. Because in your teenage years you start to create patterns in your brain. This will effect her later on, her father really needs to talk to her.\n\nEdit: also she knows what she is doing. She has seen you try and try and be nice and trying to \"not be too much\", making yourself smaller, etc. And she feels safe enough with you, because she asked you a lot, and let you take her to places and get her from places and when she needed something she knew she could get it from you. So it is not like she is hurt by you and can't stand you or be with you. She just knows what the deal is. I don't know why everyone acts like being a child means being 100% innocent and oblivious. I mean she asked her father to ask her, because she thinks you would be afraid to say no to him, and to risk your relationship. She thinks your just a weak person and probably looks down upon you.", "ESH.

Yeesh", "Why do you even bother being married to this guy?\n\nNTA but kind of the AH to yourself. This is going to go on for ever and your husband is always going to create arguments over it.

It's a printout she can get it from 1001 places. It doesn't have to be OP who prints it.

She can't get over her parents divorce because of her mother's infidelity and would like to take it out on you except when she needs you. Keep doing what you are doing. Teenagers are able to grasp that the way they treat people has consequences.", "NTA", "NTA.  Why didnt stepdaughter ask you personally to print the forms? Instead she emails her father asking him to ask you? I would have said no too.", "NTA. Considering that she wouldn't even contact you for something she needed and tried to get you to do it through her dad (I'm assuming she knows he's away) then I think she can figure out some other way. Perhaps with people she's willing to acknowledge exists.", "ESH.\n\nBoth of you are acting childish, but only one of you is a child. Sure, it sucks that she has apparently not wanted a relationship with you, but you refusing to do a simple favor such as this out of spite surely isn\u2019t going to help anything. It would have taken you all of two minutes to be the bigger, more mature person in this situation, and perhaps that could have led to potentially softening her up towards you.", "YTA. Unless there are major things you are leaving out, you are a petty AH. Your step daughter is a child and likely has a lot of differing emotions about her parents, the people her parents paired up with after they separated, and life in general. It was simple task. You have shown her that you are an unreliable adult that just happens to be married to her father. It is not the child\u2019s job to take care of the feelings of the adults around them. If you behaved better, your step daughter would eventually see all that you do/did for them. Instead you\u2019ve shown that if you don\u2019t get what you want, you will retaliate in petty ways. Congrats on being more immature and petty than an actual child.", "ESH. It wouldn\u2019t have hurt anything to print the forms for her, and would have likely helped your relationship.\n\nSure she\u2019s been a teen\u2026and that comes with a lot of AH behavior as they grow into adulthood.  But you have been keeping score waiting to \u201cget her back\u201d which puts some of the responsibility for this on your plate. \n\nAt 15 she thought she couldn\u2019t trust or depend on you (heck she was 15, if there were any adults she trusted the list was short)\u2026at 17 you confirmed her suspicion.", "INFO: is this your first time encountering a teenager?", "YTA.\n\nYou entered into her life, not the other way around. She doesn't want you to play a large role in her life and that is okay. You both don't acknowledge each other when you don't need to. That's a little less okay but whatever.\n\n I feel like maybe you might have some leg to stand on if she was asking for things that you only do with people you're close with. If she was asking for huge favors like loaning her a large sum of money or baking cookies for her entire graduating class, saying no would be just fine. But if she's over at your house and the adult that she usually reports to isn't around and she then defers to you then she's just doing what any regular teenager should be doing.

For you to get a request she would have to speak to you and make it. The word \u201cplease\u201d would also need to be included, followed by \u201cthank you\u201d. If she\u2019s not capable of that it\u2019s not your problem. That is a failure to parent.

He\u2019s also not been a good partner.", "I\u2019m sorry but absolutely YTA. You and her father chose to get married accepting this behavior. It sounds like you are the only one who changed here deciding you no longer want to help. You were just helping in hopes of forming a relationship and when that didn\u2019t happen on your terms you were done. Major husband problem as well here but you\u2019re taking it out on the kid.

I'm baffled by all the N T A answers. The stepdaughter was 11 when it started, and only 15 when OP stopped addressing her. She's a child, and obviously a troubled one. She needs help, she needs therapy, you need therapy as a family. As the adult you should absolutely seek some help for her or encourage your husband to do so. Reacting like that is so immature of you, and yes so is she but you're the adult one and should absolutely act like one.", "I'd love to put the Y T A voters in your shoes for the last 2 years.

She\u2019s never shown you any respect; she doesn\u2019t get to ask for favors - or more accurately have daddy ask you for a favor. \n\nThere are plenty of places she can go to print something, even if she didn\u2019t have extended family nearby. \n\nShe\u2019s not your child, she doesn\u2019t want to be your child - or even your friend - and you don\u2019t owe anyone who has treated you poorly anything. \n\nYour husband is an A H though.", "Assuming you are not leaving anything out, NTA. Why do they dislike you though? How did your relationship with their dad come about? Do they have reason to feel the way they do? \n\nAlso, have you confronted them about their attitudes to figure out where it is coming from? \n\nYou are the adult here, why don\u2019t you confront this like one and ask?", "NTA. I love how she told her father to tell you to do something for her.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s been a preteen/teen this entire time though. I think giving you both space and setting boundaries is appropriate given the info you shared. There may be a day when she wants to reconcile and hopefully you are open to it as she matures, but it seems best you keep your distance until she comes to that point in her life.", "NTA.  She's old enough to figure it out.", "NTA. But me personally, I\u2019d just do it. Especially since it\u2019s a smaller task.\n\nNow if she were to want you to drive her across the country or ask for a shopping spree, something big like that, that\u2019s a hell no lol. \n\nKeep it cordial, pick your battles. That\u2019s my take.", "I'll go against the grain. YTA. You're an adult shunning a teenager. You tried to be their parent but got mad they didn't see you the way you wanted them to.\n\n\"But no matter how nice or helpful I was to her, I always felt rejected.\"\n\nWhat about them?\n\nDo you think watching your parents split up, having your time spread between them and then watching a new person walk into your life and try to be your parent is a good time for a kid?\n\nPeople keep mentioning being 17 is an adult. By OP's account, 4 years of dealing with the behaviour plus 2 years of no communication. With that math (17-6), the daughter was 11 when OP came into her life.", "Yeah if I have my math right, she was 11 when this all started, and 15 when her stepmom decided to stop talking to her. I'm not seeing anything where an adult tried to help her work through her emotions in an age appropriate way.\n\nAlso, I'm confused about the custody situation. Step-daughter lives full time with bio mom? Has that always been the case? If so, what were you referring to when you said you did all the chores for them? Or did the custody arrangement change, and how did that relate to you not talking to her any longer?", "At 17, I was definitely old enough to find other resources for things rather than reaching out to people I don\u2019t get along with for favors. 17 isn\u2019t a literal child, 17 is almost a legal adult. Stepdaughter is a minor, but she\u2019s also a young adult, not a child. None of that information is really relevant here: Stepmom tried to have a relationship, was consistently rejected, so she took that to heart and said I\u2019ll leave you alone. Stepdaughter doesn\u2019t get the privilege of reaching out only when it benefits her and expecting to get what she wants. She chose to have no relationship with stepmom, so she gets the consequences of choosing that", "- I talked to step kids several times about being cordial, no need to be friends. Step daughter 17 was the only one not onboard with it. I encouraged dad to spend alone time with his children plus I tried to work on the weekends when they were visiting so they all could be alone.\nDad also tried talking to them alone\n- separation was due to infidelity from the mother\n- Don\u2019t think counseling was provided until recently. \n- Dated 1.5 years before marriage\n\nI pulled back after I arranged and paid for a family holiday trip in 2020. The thinking was that we could bond better while enjoying life. Step kids made the trip a living hell for me. Came back feeling even worst; basically disrespected, used and rejected but on vacation. To the point that I went to stay in a hotel for an entire week after we came back.  From that point until now I don\u2019t talk to her. Her siblings apologized and we\u2019re cordial", "She\u2019s a damn child", "Love this!!", "Not sure, I didn\u2019t ask", "Hahaha he\u2019s a good man, but has no rules, boundaries nor structure for his children. For my mental sanity it was better for me to step away and let my husband parent his way", "17 is not a child, it's a young adult. Adulthood is a journey, not a destination. You don't go from being a bratty kid to a mature sensible adult instantly. The daughter should know that there are consequences to treating people badly, or she should have learned that when she was a child. The dad should not have allowed his daughter to treat his wife badly in the first place.", "> It wouldn\u2019t have hurt anything to print the forms for her, and would have likely helped your relationship.\n\nMy first thought, too. Sure she's difficult -- she's a teen, AND she has a step mom. Now OP just gave her a really good reason to dislike her even more.", "Stepdaughter wasnt at OPs house.  She was at her mothers house.", "She's over at her mom's. Why does she need to call her father who's away to have her stepmom she dislikes print something for her? \nNTA", "Except she isn't at the house, she's at mom's house down the street. Also chose not to ask stepmom, but text dad to get stepmom to do it.", "Stepdaughter is 17, hardly a child. She's a young adult who is learning how to navigate life, and could conceivably be entirely on her own within a year. Looking through OP's comments, it seems like she put forth a big effort to model positive behavior, but it was poorly received. Tbh, I think the dad is TA for not doing more to get to the root of the problem, and for putting his wife in this situation, knowing how things have been going.", "You made it sound like her trying to be kind and helping is a type of manipulation. How else do you build a bound with kids if not through acts of kindness and words?", "Uh no. The dad should have stepped up and told his daughter to be respectful instead of treating someone who did nothing to her like shit. He fucked up and so didn\u2019t his ex they didn\u2019t raise her right or she would have some damn manners. You don\u2019t get to act like someone doesn\u2019t exist and then expect them to ask how high when you say jump. She respected the girls wishes of not having any relationship now she\u2019s mad when it\u2019s not benefiting her.", "Absolutely not. She hasn\u2019t positioned her as an enemy. The 17YO treats her poorly and doesn\u2019t want anything to do with her. How is OP supposed to parent her? She has parents, and the parents need to teach her to at least be civil to others. You don\u2019t have to like everyone, but the husband should have never let his children treat his wife so badly that it\u2019s come to this.", "She did say she worked on it for over 4 years. Unless OP is abusive it\u2019s Dad\u2019s fault for letting his child treat her that way.", "What is that? Being a slave and helping to create a narcissist?", "My step mom was 12 years older when I was a teenager and this was absolutely the case. It didn\u2019t matter what I did she HATED me", "Given how the situation currently I doubt her printing off forms would have made any change. NTA", "Is all this the responsibility of a step mom? It doesn't matter where it comes from. This behaviour is not normal and she has the right to protect her own mental health against this behaviour.", "Well, I don\u2019t think it was my job to help her work through her emotions, but her bio parents. I tried giving her space alone with her dad when visiting. \n\nMe helping around with their needs it was my way to make them feel welcome. \n\nStep kids live full time with bio mom. \nI decided to pull away from her bc for 4 years she was approaching me only when she needed something. Once I was useless I was another object to her. I had to protect my mental health", ">I'm not seeing anything where an adult tried to help her work through her emotions in an age appropriate way\n\nMaybe because it's not a part of the aita story? It's not relevant to what the OP wants judgement on.", "It does matter. We have no idea about the context of how stepmom was introduced to the children or how the divorce went down. Those things effect children, and children have reactions that are sometimes \u201ctoo big\u201d for the moment. Especially if the child is never given the opportunity to learn healthy ways to express their feelings. \n\nAt 17 I had a volatile relationship with my stepmom because of decisions she made when I was 14 and because of the situation surrounding how she came into my life. At 17 it is so incredibly hard to step outside a situation and see every parties point of view, and that is developmentally normal. 17 is a child. 17 is incredibly young. 17 year olds do not deserve to be held to the same standards as adults who have more life experience and a fully formed frontal lobe because they are still children.\n\nThe child didn\u2019t reach out to stepmom, she reached out to dad and dad reached out to stepmom. We don\u2019t know that the child asked for stepmom to do anything. All we know is dad said she wants to email her forms. She could have originally asked dad to print the forms and he told her he wasn\u2019t home.", "NTA, but I\u2019m curious how they ruined the vacation", "It wasn\u2019t your place to have that conversation with them about how to welcome you into their lives.

I think the child is NTA. Their parents are though. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t have a good relationship with her, and it really seems like it\u2019s not your fault though.

You did the same things parents do every single day and most of those days are thankless, do I just wake up the next day and give my kids the silent treatment? No. I think asking anything of you after you ignoring her for two years should've been viewed as a possible olive branch, especially her being older and perhaps tired of constant animosity.

We know the relationship ended because of infidelity on moms part, but we don\u2019t know that the daughter knows the real story. \u201cMean girl behavior\u201d as someone said, is usually learned behavior especially if it started as young as 11. It\u2019s not uncommon for the parent who broke up the relationship to alter the truth to make the other parent a bad person. If mom told daughter dad was the cheater and that\u2019s why their marriage ended, it would make perfect sense that the eldest daughter is resentful and closed off. Children are rarely mean to a step parent for this long if both bio parents are fostering an environment where the child feels safe enough to welcome another person into their lives. \n\nDad is TA for getting stepmom involved because he should have put a stop to it if it was daughters idea, and he never should have done it if it was his idea.", "Agreed.

It\u2019s up to the adults in their life to actually be there regardless and try to help them be better. A teen deciding to give a parent/step parent the silent treatment is pretty normal.

So if you were 11, your parents went through an awful divorce, and you saw your dad deal with his anger by refusing to talk to your mom, your takeaway might be that it's okay to not talk to or acknowledge someone you hate. \n\nAgain, I have no idea if that's what's happened here. Her parents could be rockstars at co-parenting But I do think more information is needed.
