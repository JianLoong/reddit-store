They have three of their own kids already and SILs husband is far more eager than my SIL is. SIL is perfectly aware of the fact my parents fostered when my sister and I were young, that our relationship with our parents is incredibly bad today and she wanted her and her husband to sit with me and discuss things from the POV of the kid who was already there. She has some worries about her own kids and how they could still give them a good life while helping other kids.\n\nSILs husband told me before the talk that I could sugar coat some stuff and not go into too many details. Most of my SILs questions were around how our parents juggled two kids of their own with any number of foster kids present. She wanted to know about the emotional impact. Everything.\n\nBG: I was 7 and my sister was 5 when our parents sat us down and said they were going to be helping other kids and giving them a home. They said some would be temporary but some might be permanent. It took 18 months for them to get their first foster child. We had to be interviewed and a bunch of stuff happened before. Quickly my parents went from the two of us and adding another child to having 6 kids in the home. My parents struggled to juggle everything and the ball was dropped on us.\n\nMy sister suffered a lot more than me for it. At 19 she was diagnosed with dyslexia and dyscalculia and that was after years of the school noticing but our parents not doing anything. She got caught in the middle of the teachers giving her notes to give our parents and growing frustrated when our parents wouldn't respond or agree to meetings. While our parents would say they would go, would forget, mom would ask to be reminded but then become annoyed at being \"pestered\" about it. My sister gave up after more than a year of feeling like she was in trouble everywhere. She also never finished high school because her grades were so bad.\n\nI have asthma and sometimes my needs with that weren't met the best. My sister tried to help by taking care of some of the dust for me. But it was hard sometimes when some of the foster kids had a lot of dust on their things they would bring to our house and I was exposed to them. Our parents would always say the house was clean or would say a little dust wouldn't be too bad. But my asthma is more dust sensitive.\n\nThe relationship with my parents was almost entirely broken down by the time we hit our teens. It never recovered.\n\nMy SIL and her husband heard a lot of those details and more in some of my answers. I explained some can make it work. But if you can't and your bio kids are the ones the ball is dropped on, the damage can't always be reversed. My SILs husband accused me of trying to turn them off fostering and said I was preying on SILs fears.

The husband already knew since he was asking you to sugarcoat before you even started.", "NTA and your BIL is being sketchy as hell.", "NTA \n\n\nAnd I'm really worried about how coercive he is trying to be about it. What is his end game? \n\n\n\nDoes he just want the money from the system while his wife does all the work? Is he an involved father with his own kids? \n\n\nIs someone he works with fostering children and he wants the attention and for everyone to think he's a Saint?", "NTA. They asked, you gave them your experience. It sounds like you also were clear that this was YOUR experience and that not all foster situations would end up like yours.\n\nIf they decide to foster, things like this are things they will have to consider - or their bio kids as well as their foster kids will be the ones to suffer.", "Nta- I was in a similar situation when my grandparents fostered- we also don\u2019t have a relationship anymore. The husband is a major AH for asking you to lie so he can get what he wants, completely ignoring his wife\u2019s VERY VALID concerns.", "NTA\n\nBut given that your bil and sil already knew your relationship with your parents suffered bc of the fostering to a point where the damage couldn't be undone anymore, how the hell did bil expect you to sugarcoat this? That doesn't sound possible. Like yeah, our relationship with our parents suffered and is nearly non existent anymore, but thats a good thing, yk, who wants to have a relationship with their adult kids / parents anyway? I save a lot of money on gifts i don't have to purchase and them too and all of us save so much time with never visiting each others, you should try it out too... ?", "NTA!! I\u2019m a former foster parent, and it\u2019s WORK. My wife and I repeatedly said that it was a full time second job, on top of taking care of the kids - and we had babies/toddlers who didn\u2019t have a ton of external trauma and whose processing of what was going on was a lot more limited.\n\nWe still had our two long term fosters when I was pregnant, and one of them stayed with us for the first couple months our daughter was here. I loved that boy - we literally took him home from the hospital, and he was the third kid we had fostered from that family. \n\nHowever, after he went to his dad, we closed our home. His big brother had been 4 when he went to HIS dad, and we saw how hard it was for him, who lived with us for years, to understand where his brothers went - despite us working to make sure they all stayed connected. I was really scared of having our daughter grow up with the insecurity I felt about my housing situations, because she would be too young to understand why some kids stayed, and some left. I wanted to wait until she was old enough for it to be a family decision to do it again. \n\nWe have done some one off respite weekends, but only for kids we\u2019ve fostered before. Our daughter is two now, and she loves those visits - but she knows they are visits, and she knows she is staying in our home.\n\nAs a parent, SIL has to consider all angles - because it is doable, but you have to be honest about your limits. We rarely took older kids, and never took medical cases. We didn\u2019t blend families unless they were all babies. You have to be prepared for, and think through these things, in the way your parents didn\u2019t", ">My SILs husband accused me of trying to turn them off fostering and said I was preying on SILs fears. He said I had no reason to give out so much information.\n\nSIL husband sounds like he has some form of saviour complex and has lashed out when he heard hard and difficult facts from someone who's lived in a house hold with foster children. \n\nYes, some absolutely can make it work and it's admirable . Not everyone can. It's beyond selfish not to recognise that. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit ... spelling of selfish \ud83d\ude06", "NTA. Your sister-in-law wanted to know all about it, the good and the bad and what impact it had on the bio-children - and that's totally understandable.\n\nYes, it can turn out very well, just as it can turn out very badly, and you have to be prepared. You don't embark on this adventure lightly, because the lives of many people are affected.  Your BIL doesn't seem to realize this, or doesn't want to. Your sister-in-law apparently isn't keen, and that's already a bad start. It has to be a well-considered, mutual decision. One shouldn't pressurize the other into doing it.", "Big NTA here.  I\u2019m weirded out by the husband a bit.  He\u2019s definitely already decided and is now just trying to coerce SIL.", "NTA\n\nYou were honest with your answers. You would have been doing your Nephews/Nieces a disservice had you not been honest and open to both your SIL and her husband regarding the effect that it could have on their future upbringing and mental health and ultimately their family relationships.\n\nThat SIL's husband prior to the discussion saying you *\"could sugar coat some stuff and not go into too many details.\"* indicates he is fully aware of the downside to fostering and the negative impact it could have on his immediate family. Hiding the truth, and expecting you to go along with it, so that he can persuade his wife, is completely dishonest and manipulative. If this is a tactic he employs on a regular basis within his marriage then it does not bode well for the future of the marriage, kids or fosters in the future.\n\nIs SIL's husband thinking purely of the remuneration they would receive for the fostering, while leaving the real work and responsibility involved to his wife? Are they possibly struggling financially, perhaps without the knowledge of his wife, and he sees this as an easy way to make a little extra to pay the mortgage etc.\n\nBetter to suffer the ire of the husband than live with the regrets and guilt over a bad situation that you could have helped them as a family avoid.", "NTA even if they go ahead, surely knowing all the pitfalls will only help them more to avoid them?\n\nDoes he just want the money of fostering?", "NTA\n\nfostering is a huge commitment and needs both adults fully on board. It\u2019s not all flowery \u201cgiving a child a good home\u201d, \u201chelping other kids\u201d situations, often the children are emotionally damaged and do not want the \u201dnice home\u201d often they would rather remain with their own parent(s) regardless of the neglect.  The kids can lie and accuse the carers of criminal acts, the family need to change the way they work to ensure no one is left vulnerable to false accusation. Being foster parents is a full time job and a good thing to do, but their own children need to be their first priority. Maybe they could defer the decision until their own children are older and independent.\n\nFrom my experience, everyone in the family should be 100% in agreement on this. Foster children need a safe stable environment, not one where the adults are not committed.  \n\nAs well as this being tough on their own kids, it will be tough on their marriage.", "NTA\n\nA lot of folks here are questioning whether the BIL just wants the money.  A more benign explanation is that he\u2019s a do gooder who has bought into the Hallmark movie idea of fostering, and doesn\u2019t want to accept that older kids will almost certainly come with trauma and won\u2019t be easy.\n\nYour parents jumped in too deep.  If your SIL is interested, they can limit themselves to single children. Or respite care.  Just because a SW calls with a placement, fosters are not obligated to say yes.", "NTA\n\nYou answered their questions about YOUR experience honestly. Sugar coating would have been the wrong move here. \n\nAlso: If they listened carefully, they could learn some valuable principles to put in place before fostering: \n\n- always ask all family members how they feel about a new placement. It is an all yes or no situation \n- don't overcrowd, put a limit and stick to it\n- all emotional, medical and school needs must be met for ALL children. If it becomes apparent that bio children disproportionally come short, short and long term solutions have to be found (grandparents / family support, temp placements ending doesn't result in a new kid, splitting duties more often)\n- if money becomes an issue, fostering may need to end completely\n- bio kids shouldn't have to give up too much of what that had in favor of foster children. (fosters shouldn't be treated like cinderella, just make sure the bios don't end up feeling sidelined in favor of from their perspective strangers)\n\n\nBasically coming up with rules that ensure that everyone is happy with fostering. Make sure, breaks between placements are accepted and welcome. If fostering doesn't fit into someones life anymore, it is a valid choice to stop.", "NTA.\"Well, BIL you said I could sugar coat it and I did. What I said is the nice, happy version of my life.\"", "Tell them to read a couple of books by Cathy glass she is a foster parent and a has biological children and some worked out great and others she couldn't help as much some came from traumatic backgrounds and if your not ready and prepared for that it's going to hurt everyone some you have no idea what to expect some are just eager to finally be loved and cared for and some are to far gone to help. Give her the gift of books to read on the subject then say while it a wonderful thought now you have a more rounded picture.", "NTA.

Good for you for sitting them down and giving the unvarnished truth \n\nNTA", "I'm curious to know, who does most of the child rearing and who's the more \"fun parent.\" 3 kids sounds like a lot of work already and to add more is more time, money, and stress.

So really, who's the one that is more likely to deal with the additional labor of adding more children.\n\nNTA\n\nYou spoke your truth, fostering can be good if both parents are in agreement and prepared, but there will always be drawbacks and challenges.

They need to know what to do when a 7yo acts out sexually, because they\u2019ve been used for that until they think it\u2019s normal to grab daddy\u2019s penis. They should be prepared to juggle tutoring for kids who are two grades behind their peers and profoundly defensive and uncooperative about it. They should be strong enough to handle a tall, muscular 14yo with impulse control issues whose mother drank through her pregnancy.", "NTA of course.

We were poor to begin with and then we added six kids in the tiniest of houses. My mother was not on board but my dad was an abusive, manipulative alcoholic that could talk her into pretty much anything. I think SIL needs someone to be honest. Her husband and the state aren\u2019t the ones.", "NTA. and if the BIL has such a heart to help kids in need there are a other ways besides fostering. Be a big brother, volunteer at places for displaced children, donate money and supplies. Expecting his wife to dedicate her time and effort when her heart isn\u2019t in it is not ok. It\u2019s factually a burden to have a foster kid in your home. There is usually court ordered therapy and visits with bio parents. A lot of time and effort for each kids\u2019 needs to be met. I was a foster kid and I spent some times in different homes and my biggest takeaway was the chaos and how many kids were troubled and causing trouble and how the quieter ones were left unsupervised to get into whatever they wanted as long as they were sly bout it. I can totally see how the bio kids in a foster situation would feel sidelined and maybe even unsafe bc some kids are coming from real trauma and abuse. Going into that unprepared and not 100% ready and willing is recipe for disaster all around.", "NTA how much do we want to bet BIL wants some moral high ground \u201cgood guy\u201d points from fostering and SIL knows she\u2019s going to absolutely be doing the bulk of emotional, mental and household labor?", "why does he want so many kids? no one is batting an eye about that fact?

I've known parents who neglected and forgot both their their bio kids' and fosterings stuff, and parents who were totally on top of everybody's stuff. So it just seems like you had crummy parents, and it was exacerbated by them taking on more kids.  \nI don't think YTA for being honest about your experience, thought maybe you were somewhat unfair if you presented this as a fostering issue and didn't make any distinction between what was just your parents' ineptitude and what was actually fostering-related?  I'm sure there is probably some correlation of parents who don't have a good grasp on what they can manage already then being more likely to decide to take foster kids in.

My moms hand immediately popped up, although my dad wasn't real hot on the idea. So we ended up with 2 girls and a boy, on top of us already having 4 boys and myself(F). Since I was the only girl, the 2 younger girls stayed im my room, so I got upper bunk, and they shared the lower. One constantly wet the bed, so my mom told her if she didn't wet it one night, she could sleep with me in my top bunk. She promptly wet my bed. They broke all my stuff, including a really cool sewing machine I got for Christmas. The boy was no better except that instead of wetting the bed, he'd get up and go pee in a corner. They all would hide food, steal money from piggy banks, etc and throw fits when they got caught. Their dad was a fisherman who was supposed to pay my parents for their upkeep monthly. He never did, and on top of that, drank up most of his pay leaving nothing to rent a place so he could take back his kids. He ended up living in a one room lake cottage that people rent during summer vacations. After 3 months of my parents juggling finances to pay for the extra kids (my mom was stay at home), my dad had enough and told the minister what was happening and that they needed to find another placement. Its a whole lot of work. And there's always the possibility that the children you foster come with serious baggage through no fault of their own.

They're removed from their home for a reason, and it's NEVER a good one. These kids have often been through trauma, a LOT of it.

Thank you also for your story, it helped me to read it.

Asking someone to lie to your partner to get what you want when it comes to such a delicate matter is a red flag the size of a country. \n\nThey should work on their relationship first and the husband should learn to think about someone other than himself and what he wants before even entertaining the idea to foster children with small ones already in the house.", "NTA she asked for information you gave her the information presumably truthfully as you know it.

My mother had a stillborn baby a few years after I was born, so I truly think that \"need\" to give to other children was a major driving factor towards foster care. \n\nI do think my relationship with my mother suffered because of this. I'm now 32 and recently in therapy, I've come to realize a lot of my issues stem from a lack of a relationship/activities with her, and upon reflection I realized it was because she was busy taking care of the foster children.\n\nIn the beginning, it was mostly jealousy, but I was a young pre-teen with angst. I forgive myself now for those feelings in hindsight. My parents scolded me, told me to try to comprehend the situation these foster children have been in, but I didn't have that kind of foresight that young. \n\nA lot of the children that came into our home were suffering mentally, so I was exposed to that. I don't blame them, but holy shit it was a lot. One kicked my dog, one threatened to burn the house down, taken away in handcuffs. One sold my brothers bike in secret. One did drugs in school. One woukd SCREAM in the bathrub because he was abused there by his parents. Again, obviously these children were in horrible situations, and my parents wanted to show them a loving home, but as a young girl it confusing to deal with. \n\nAnyway, I played softball until college. My dad was always there for practices, games, tournaments, etc. My mom couldn't go because of childcare. \n\nLong story short, my mom fucking LOST it when I went to college, moved out, got married. She is desperate to be with me ALL OF THE TIME. It has been so offputting. She had her chance to make memories for me but she blew it.\n\nI've been in therapy for anxiety and depression and I've literally JUST realized why I'm this way. I had a normal relationship with my dad, but my mom was absent for my essential years. Now that I've moved out and grown up, she is regretting the time she put into the foster children instead of me. My dad has even said that very phrase me, she regrets taking in foster children.  \n\nTaking in fostering children is an extremely kind, loving gesture. Don't get me wrong, that kind of care is essential and most people who do it are saints. But I'd be lying to say everyone is equipped for the job. They need to consider their own children first and what it would mean for them. It was so weird having another girl call my mother \"mommy\" two weeks into living with us. She needed it, I know now, but damn it was weird. \n\nSorry this has been a long rant, but I encourage them to listen to my circumstance. I'm sure they are plenty of positive stories out there, too, though.", "NTA, and you should let SIL know that her husband wanted you to lie on order to get her to agree to foster.

They had requested that being new to the process they weren't on the list for a child with behavioral issues, as they didn't feel like they were ready for that as this would be their first one. The phone rang and the case worker explained about this early teen boy and told them that there were no behavioral issues, he just recently lost his parents in an accident. Okay, no problem. It was a hellish two weeks because the caseworker lied. The boy had been to several other foater homes, been assaulted, did have behavioral issues and would lash out at random times. By the time they were able to get hold of the caseworker and get the real story, there were holes in the walls, broken pictures, and they had to replace the banister that went upstairs. He had tried to fight the kids (teen country boys who had no issues dodging a fist), but what set my friend off was when the kid went after his wife. The boy was removed and they put their status on hold. The point is, they had a certain idea of what it would be like and it was nothing like that.\n\nExplain to your SIL and BIL that sure, they may get lucky and get some kids who just need a safe place to stay and it would be like an extended sleepover.

Is your BIL one of those who sees dollar signs at the thought of being a foster parent. I've heard more cases in recent years of people filling their houses with foster children, quitting their jobs, and living off the stipends given but not meeting the childrens needs. AKA: using the foster kids as a cash cow. I've personally met one foster parent like this, but have heard of several in the area I used to live.\n\nYou are NTA. Personal experience needs to be shared so they can understand the pros and cons of their decision. I'm now concerned why your BIL is so gung-ho about it.", "I'm confused by something.  Why do you call SILs husband instead of your brother?  Anyway, you're NTA", "NTA. Apparently BIL. Is a liar and only cares about his own opinion,   tell him he would not pass the parent screenings.", "NTA, tell him you are looking out for your sister and their children as he should be. He should know that his children and his wife will be affected by this and not all in a good way. With everything t your sister went through I would say you BIL is TAW in this for even considering this with already having 3 kids. I think this is just going to be too much for your sister. He\u2019s playing with fire.", "NTA\n\nThey asked for your experience, and for your BIL to secretly ask you to \u201csugarcoat\u201d is selfish and deeply irresponsible. We\u2019re talking about defenseless kids here, their own and any potential foster children. No one should be taking in foster kids who isn\u2019t 100% committed and confident in being able to give their best. You did the right thing. BIL is trying to pressure his wife here and it\u2019s so wrong.\n\nI have a friend who decided to foster, and it was rewarding in some ways as well as traumatizing for their family in many others. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d do it again, if they\u2019d known what it would be like.", "\"He said I had no reason to give out so much information.\"\n\nYeah, he's dead set on wanting to do this and doesn't want to face anything that might be a downside. This will be a disaster. \n\nNTA", "NTA.", "I'm sorry you and your sister were neglected by your parents. You are definitely right for not wanting the same for your nieces and nephews. I believe your brother-in-law and sister-in-law are not truly thinking about or understanding the potential harm this will cause their own children. You're not the asshole and were totally in the right", "NTA. Your brother-in-law wanted you to manipulate his wife with incomplete statements! You were supposed to manipulate his wife so that everything would go his way.\nYou are zero the A. You stayed honest and foiled your brother-in-law's dastardly plan. That's right! I feel sorry for your brother-in-law's wife to be with such a manipulator. You did the right thing with your openness and honesty.", "Just because your parents bit off more than they could chew doesn't mean your SIL and BIL can't make it work. Many blended foster families do just fine with foster and natural children.\n\nThat being said, you don't need to sugar coat anything. Your experience is valid, and they should know the realities from all perspectives. \n\nIf your SIL isn't into it, they shouldn't.", "NTA at all. My husband and I foster, and the number one thing DHHS says is they\u2019d rather you say no to a request than have a placement that negatively impacts any child. Giving your SIL the facts was a kindness to both her and any future future children they welcome.", "NTA They asked for your experience and you gave that to them. It\u2019s not your fault it isn\u2019t what they wanted to hear.", "Is your SIL's husband a mind reader, or were you just telling the truth?  Hmm, I wonder what's more likely? NTA", "Fostering kids is not a laughing matter, nor a hobby, you did well by being realistic about this matter, this is not the Shazam movie. NTA", "NTA\n\nI have to wonder why he is so eager. Many think it's a quick easy way to get an income.  If you (general form of you) are fostering for money then you are doing it for the wrong reasons.  \n\nI have been on the other side. I was in and out of foster care for 7 years.  Many Foster parents don't realize the intensity of the commitment. Sometimes after a few weeks I would be moved to a different home.  I would show up with little to no clothing or school supplies, which the foster family would struggle with fighting with the agency to get vouchers to purchase necessities. Or have to pay for it themselves.  My reunification plans required transportation to weekly visits with my mom, weekly trips to family therapy, and every other week meetings with the social workers from both sides and a monthly visit to family court.   Fosters aren't really supposed to have the responsibility of transport. But often the social workers fail to schedule, or are running late, etc. In addition, I had to attend regular doctors appointments for yearly checkup, then when I had to get braces it was every other week or so.   \n\nThen as the oldest kid in the house the families would often treat me as free maid, cook, or babysitter.  I was often told it was my duty to them since they had to take me in and deal with all my crap.  Ever wonder why some foster kids are eager to return home back to their place of abuse? Because the devil you know is better than the one you don't.  We are good at predicting what our abuser will do, not so much with strangers.  Many fosters aren't equipped or educated in how to deal with the mental anguish of an abused child.   I consider myself lucky none of my fosters ever touched me in any way.  But many were mentally abusive and obviously didn't care about me at all. \n\nNot too mention the heartache on both sides when you finally connect and are then taken away.  Because the courts always push for reunification. Always.  \n\nSo I applaud you for laying it all out there for SIL.  It's not something you can go into blindly. \n\nAnd I just gave myself the ick because other reasons BIL might be so eager to foster occurred to me.  And yes I know men can also want to foster and can be great foster parents. I just don't understand why he would push for it and want to mislead his wife unless there is anorher motive.", "NTA, people often use rose colored glasses when looking at fostering. Those kids have traumas and special needs, it is hard on the family. My parents also wanted to foster, but decided against it because they didn\u2019t have much free time taking care of 3 kids. Unfortunately they died in a car accident young, but their plan was to foster once we graduated from college. \n\nIt is always commendable to help other kids, but short of family or friends tragedies I am not going to foster any kids until my kids are old enough, or well established. I actually think it is pretty selfish to try and play the hero at the sacrifice of your own kids.", "Nta. One thing I tell everyone around me. If you aren't sure you want my honest answer them don't even ask the question. There's nonsugar coating or beating around the bush when you're outright asked about something. You didn't go to them with unsolicited information. They asked for it.", "It\u2019s good that you were honest and didn\u2019t only tell them the good parts of fostering. If things were to go badly when they fostered, your SIL may have potentially blamed you for not \u201cwarning\u201d her ahead of time. NTA, you did the right thing and her husband is wrong for trying to get you to lie by omission.", "NTA but you did sugarcoat it, their kids are going to be ignored because the foster child or siblings will not have been to the dentist or pediatrician for X amount of time.  One of my friend's nieces hadn't seen a dentist or doctor in several years till they lived with him.  My Sister and niece fostered. most of the children had mental and emotional delays or physical ones so not only were the children in therapy, going to doctor's appointments, and getting all their shots, but they also had to take time off work and use up sick leave.  The kids acted out, and terrorized my sister's grandson along with pets.\n\nNow the flip side is that they had one or two great kids but not all of them were not to mention the mental and emotional well-being of the adults in the family took a hit.", "As much as I support helping kids, I would not leave my bio kids alone with foster kids. The sad truth is that many have experienced trauma and abuse and frequently act out. This is another reason not to foster kids. NTA, and good job speaking your truth", "I would question why BIL is so set to do this. He doesn't seem like the type to actually help children. I'm guessing he'd be getting a fat check for every kid he fostered... NTA", "NTA SIL\u2019s husband is selfish. All he is thinking about is his own needs to have a big family or look like a hero.", "NTA, you have a moral obligation to them and keeping your feelings about the possibilities and your experience secret would be wrong. It isn't like lying to spare someone's feelings, you're telling the truth because it is important. They could have unlimited money and fostering could still be difficult because we can't have unlimited time or energy.", "Nta. You should be able to tell your story when asked. However, it sounds like SIL was trying to use you as an excuse out. SIL should have just been able to say her opinions on fostering whilst not bringing you in to give credibility. It sounds like their relationship is not that great to begin with.\n\nIt's also important to remember that your situation is not that of all children in similar situations. It doesn't make your story less valid just means that not every foster family with biological children ends badly. I am close friends with a family that had 1 biological daughter and 1 adopted daughter and fostered from when she was very young thru adulthood when they eventually adopted 2 more children that were originally foster children. Her needs were met, her sisters needs were met and the needs of their foster children were met. The parents ultimately are the ones who decide if it's your reality and relationship or a happy and healthy one.", "NTA\n\nDon't ask questions if you don't want to hear the answer.", "Not the ahole. \n\nYou gave them a reality check to be realistic in this decision that will fail if she feels overwhelmed or their children. \n\nI am an adopted kid. It sucked. My mom and dad's bio children resented me. They had me when they were older and more stable in their finances and more mature emotionally. They resented my relationship I had with them. I had a thing i did when I walked into the house \" mom, mom, mommy mama, ma\" over and over till she answered lol it was our thing. Dad treated me amazing. He would tell me storys at night while we were watching the stars and he would just sit there and talk. I still remember listening to the frogs noise, and looking at the skyline full of stars and hearing his voice. \n\nThey didn't have these stories. These memories. They both worked full time. They had little time and money. Different times. There were always in their 50s when they raised me compared to their 20s with them. One of their daughters barely likes me, another feels bad for me, and my only brother (their son) was the nicest but also kept me at a distance. \n\nNot everyone is able to do this. \n\nNot the ahole. Their kids should have a say about this. And parents need to listen.", "NTA, not sure what your parent's intentions were, I've seen many a foster parent take breaks when they're overwhelmed.\n\nYour SIL and her husband should watch \"Instant Family\", it's a pretty good portrayal of what the foster system looks like. From the behaviors of the children, the types of White Savior parents, the conflicted biological parents and the social workers.", "Nta. \n\nI am a foster parent, former foster child. It is not for the weak.", "NTA, they asked for your experience and then got mad at you for being honest? That makes absolutely no sense. The husband just wanted you to affirm his desire. You were smart to be truthful. You didn't even say not to do it; you just said to be mindful to not neglect your bio kids. Instead of taking that as an opportunity to learn how to do it better, he got angry. Maybe that shows that he's not in an emotionally intelligent position to handle this situation.", "NTA. He asked, you answered. Not your fault he can't handle the truth.  Not everyone is mentally, emotionally, or financially equipped to be foster parents.  God bless those who are, but the rest need to understand the risks and their own limits.", "Of course you are NTA. You were asked to share your experience, and you did. And this is the experience of many people whose parents decide to foster. It was my experience too. And I can tell you that no one wants to hear it. People love the idea of the selfless family that takes in others, and they shut down quick hearing that it was in any way an unhealthy environment. I see you, I hear you, I understand.", "NTA. People need to understand the harsh realities of fostering. It's not a cute idea for spontaneous people who love kids. It's a very serious, very difficult lifestyle. The fact that your SIL's husband is mad at you for telling the truth tells me he shouldn't be fostering kids.", "NTA, you had your sisters back. If you held off, to satisfy BiL, what would that have achieved?", "NTA. As a parent who fostered to adopt (2 girls) after we couldn't concieve again after our son, it's A LOT. If SIL is trying to see all the perspectives, good for her. If BIL doesn't want to hear them, he's not going into the process with the right mindset. Our girls both have issues and traumas they work through and our youngest was only 13 months when she came to us. Therpists have told us they internalize things even before they can talk. I'm really questioning BILs motives here ...", "NTA\n\nI've read too many stories on reddit about parents who sacrificed the relationship with their bio kids in order to get social points for fostering other kids, it's the middle aged version of clout I guess.", "NTA\n\nIn what universe could you be? She had questions. You had answers based on experience. Her husband wanted you to lie to his wife so he could get what he wanted. That's unfair to you, disrespectful to his wife, and horrendous for their marriage.", "NTA. You gave your SiL exactly what she asked for and needed. Your wife's brother is looking at fostering as some magical good thing and that's not a good mindset to be in when fostering. You need to understand the good and the bad and not deny the bad.", "NTA. They asked and you truthfully shared. I have w ok rked with many foster kids and their families. Usually I see the parents' reasons and motivation is to truly help but I have also seen foster parents that did it because someone at church was doing it and I could tell they wanted accolades for their sacrifice. Ive even seen foster parents that specifically want to foster kids of a different race so everyone will see how amazing they are. These same people are often surprised to find out that parenting a traumatized child is really hard and the kids aren't always appreciative of their efforts. The bio kids in the family can easily get lost as OP and her sister were. They should be thankful you were honest .", "NTA by long shot, but your BIL is a ***major*** AH!\n\nYou were asked to detail your experience living through a life-altering change from your childhood. \n\nThere is is zero room for sugar coating here! Prospective foster parents need to hear the unforgiving, gritty details of this decision and how it may impact the non-adults in the home. \n\nI'm so sorry to hear about your soured relationship with your parents. You're blameless in this situation.", ">SILs husband told me before the talk that I could sugar coat some stuff and not go into too many details.\n\n>My SILs husband accused me of trying to turn them off fostering and said I was preying on SILs fears. He said I had no reason to give out so much information.\n\nI have a question for SiLs husband. Why do you want to foster? And would you be the one looking after the foster kids or would you be dumping their care onto your wife and kids?\n\nWhy do you want to foster so badly that when your wife brings up valid concerns and decided to directly ask someone with first had knowledge that you first tell them to sugar coat their experience so you can coerse your wife into making a terrible decision without all of the facts, then have the audacity to bitch at the person telling you their experience and warning you what could happen.\n\nWhy are you ignoring very very real and valid concerns? Especially when doing so could be detrimental to not only your own children but to the children you're supposed to be helping that you foster?\n\nOP NTA. You said what you said to ensure sil knows exactly what she would be getting into and to ensure ALL kids who would be in their care would get the care and attention they need and deserve.\n\nSomething tells me the husband sees it as an easy paycheck since foster carers get paid to look after children.", "NTA - If they didn't want your opinion, they shouldn't have asked.\n\nHis accusation is a confession. He's the one who wanted you to color your answers favourably to help sway his wife's opinion.\n\nApparently, the fact that it might negatively impact his kids weighs less than the fact that he wants to do it. Kind of makes him TA tbh.", "Nta- fostering has lots of pros, cons, pitfalls that you need to be aware of before making a decision. Just like anything in life it\u2019s good to hear things from those who have been through it. Your situation was somewhat unique or I hope so! In that most parents would not ignore your health needs and other kids educational needs considering those are neglect issues and ironically can lead kids into care like the ones they tried to help.\n\nYou\u2019re right about the dust and debris on their belongings, not their fault of course, but interesting in my state when they are approving your home there are lots of things they require one of which is to have a small lockable container in fridge for medicine that needs to be kept cold. You may wonder what medicine and why have before you even are licensed or have kids because they know it\u2019s common these kids come from roach infested homes and ear infections from them going into ears at night and the medicine to treat that must be kept refridgerated.", "As someone who was a foster kid and wants to foster in the future, I think it would be wise to wait until your bio kids are at least high school age. That way you aren\u2019t putting foster kids above your own kids( foster kids require A LOT of time and special attention)", "NTA. Your SIL's husband is an accident waiting to happen, and his attitude gives me concerns that he's going to be the one dropping the ball leaving your SIL to pick up the pieces.", "NTA. He tried convincing you to lie as a way to manipulate his wife into something. A decision that will have a lasting impact on more a handful of people, mostly children. That's so wrong. \n\nYou aren't an asshole for telling the truth, and you certainly aren't a bad person for openly expressing **your** truth.", "So his complaint is that you were honest\u203d NTA.", "NTA. And I guarantee he's expecting his wife to do most of the heavy lifting with the fosters while he gets to sit back and feel like a hero.", "I\u2019d bet money he thought his wife was exaggerating and wanted you to prove it.

He's the asshole in this story", "Your BIL is a huge AH. Do not ask the question if you want to hear lies or a sugar coated version of the truth.  \nYou are NTA. Why is he so determined to foster? It seems so odd that he's pushing so hard.", "NTA - Why would he want you to lie about your experiences. They sound pretty bad and people need to know the facts. Thank you for sharing them. Why is he so anxious to be a foster parent? Maybe address that question with him. At all cost? Not a good idea.", "Absolutely not. He needed to hear that reality because fostering others while raising your own is hard. They needed to know that, especially her, because, let's be honest here, most of that responsibility will fall on her. He'll be the great guy who does weekend stuff with the kids but that's not an equal partnership in raising kids. Every woman gets that. Should be her decision, not his.", "NTA - and I am very suspicious of BIL's true motives for wanting more children in the home despite the struggles, hardships and sacrifices. I'm getting the sense it's for something besides wanting to provide a good home environment for kids in need.

He listened to your story which was painful to read and heartbreaking.  I felt for you and your sister and wanted to reach out and just hug the two of you. But not your BIL - he asked you to answer questions, listened to the same honest from the heart story you told us and decided to also abuse you.  Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have foster kids just based on that because those kids need more too.   He\u2019s proven he is not able to listen and sympathetically work through a solution.  What a dick.

The husband seems to be the person who is too comfortable shaping narratives to fit his agenda.", "I would love to know why BIL is so keen to foster? Is he filled with altruism to make a better world? I couldn't quite decipher if sis has kids yet or not: and if so, are they BIL's bio kids?", "BIL is annoyed that OP is standing in the way of all the community clout he would get for being able to brag about fostering.  I've known a number of foster kids and kids who were raised with foster children.  The welfare of both natural and foster children was almost never equally of concern to the parents.  One usually got the raw end of the deal.  NTA.", "Jumping on top comment here so hopefully OP sees it.\n\nBut what is BILs motive behind waiting to foster? As he seems really keen despite SIL being on the fence, leaning towards not wanting to do it. \n\nIs it finacial? Did he want more kids? Are their kids are the same gender? \n\nI dunno what it is, but something seems really off on this from BILs side as he's pushing not only his wife, but possibly his kids also, into something that they don't want.\n\nFostering kids isn't a easy task and shouldn't be taken with a grain of salt. If SIL has genuine concerns, which she does, about how bringing in these vulnerable and often traumatised kids into their home will affect their own kids, OP is more than in the right to tell her plainly and truthfully her experience and not sugar coating it to make it appear all rainbows and unicorns.", "\"Only take on the kids you can handle\" is a very common sense take. The OP really didn't say anything revolutionary.", "NTA, your SIL's husband sees this either as an opportunity to make money or to satisfy his savior complex, unaware that this will cost him his relationship with his own family. The fact that he asked you to sugarcoat stuff shows that he wanted you to play along in convincing his wife about fostering.\n\nI typically use the following line with these people \"You can either ask for my opinion, or you can ask me to repeat what you want to hear.

Why is he so intent on fostering to the point that he is seemingly refusing to look at any serious negatives thst may impact his life?", "I don't understand why he insists fostering is perfect. it's not. unless you got a baby there's a good chance 90% of the time you're getting a kid that's traumatized from past foster homes or in their life. and there's a huge risk inviting foster kids can open up to problems that wasn't present in home before like drug use, trauma relapsing, stealing stuff, or just a quiet kid that don't speak about anything and blows up later on when no one knows them. although my family had not fostered anyone I know of, my brother's ex girlfriend is mooching off my mom by living there. I dislike her severely due to past issues of boundaries and disliking her children. she brought drug use, issues about her past homes or lives, and her kids with her.", "And guess who the bulk of parenting would fall on?

Or to make it seem like we were just childish and couldn't accept our parents helping other kids.", "It's a lot of work and it can be too much for some people, which if you can figure out before fostering, it can be even better than finding out after. That's something I always try to speak about when people ask.\n\nThe blending families thing is an aspect some don't always consider thoroughly too. My sister and I were excited and loved meeting the kids when we were younger and before things got so bad for us. Not all the kids were into us and some were. It was hard to say goodbye for a while. But then we withdrew and stuck to ourselves which was hard on some of the foster kids who wanted to be close to us while some were glad we weren't interested in getting to know them.\n\nMessing up can have a lot of repercussions and I think it's great that you considered the impact on your daughter as well.", "That's the vibe he has always given me.", "It **is** beyond shellfish and the husband shouldn't be carping on it.
