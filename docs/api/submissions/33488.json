SIL has 3 kids ages 5, 7 and 9. My husband and I have two kids ages 8 and 4. SIL and I both work from home so we were both home all day when they were staying with us.\n\nSo here's what happened. She asked if I would cook for all the kids vs us each cooking for our respective kids. I told her sure but explained to her how my kids eat and wanted to know whether she wanted them on the same schedule or whether she wanted a typical three meals deal. She said to feed them three meals.\n\nFor context on how I feed my kids. We do smaller meal sizes but eating more often. So pre-meal snacks are big in our family. Seconds are also a thing if we have a \"hungry day\". I also try to mix in a lot of different choices week to week so food is still enjoyable.\n\nI know her kids' likes and dislikes with food so I took those into consideration when making food. But the kids did not want to eat the stuff I was making. They were upset it wasn't pizza or burgers or they were upset about tacos I make at home vs takeout ones. The kids dug in their heels and said I needed to give them food they wanted. I told SIL and she would go to feed them. Then she'd get mad that I hadn't given them the food they wanted. I asked her if she wanted to take over feeding her kids and she said no.\n\nIt got to the point where the kids stopped coming to the table at meal times. Since SIL was aware of this I just let it go because I felt like she would make them come to the table if she was upset by them not eating much. They were in the office with her sometimes when we were eating.\n\nThe day they were going back home she turned to me and told me I should be ashamed of myself for letting her kids go without food. My husband told her she was here the whole time and should have done more. He also pointed out we did them a favor and she was acting very ungrateful. \n\nA couple of weeks later she sent me a text saying yet again I should be ashamed and how could I refuse to accommodate children. I told SIL it wasn't my job to make her kids eat and that I had communicated with her while this was ongoing but she ignored me and expected me to bend over backward for them. She accused me of cruelty to kids and told me I was an ass for thinking it wasn't my job to make sure children under my roof were eating enough.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703176675, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nr590/aita_for_telling_my_sil_it_wasnt_my_job_to_make/", "score": 386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I do feel like I may have been an AH is because it might sound a little cold to speak about kids not really eating. They're all young (SILs children) and I'm an adult and I knew they weren't eating but I left it for SIL to deal with. And then I dismiss any responsibility for it.

OP is a grown woman who can stand up for herself, and if she was worried about her husband\u2019s support, she would be making a post about that instead. There\u2019s already enough drama with the SIL, and there\u2019s no need to try and stir the pot.", "I fully acknowledge bratty kids exist. However I also feel that it\u2019s necessary to acknowledge that sometimes that isn\u2019t the case. Because neurodivergent children have become malnourished after being denied safe foods. And fast food is a common for for a simple reason", "Oh no I didn't say that op has to teach the kids. I just pointed it out. Sorry if I didn't frame it right", "Yes, your idea is better, an ITEMIZED invoice!  It\u2019s amazing that people can act so entitled and think there won\u2019t be consequences!", "Then their mother, who, once again, was there all the time, should've gotten them some. This isn't on op at all. \n\n Ffs, i know on reddit everyone and their mama has autism, adhd etc. But in real life, those are rare. Autism is like 1% of the population.... the chances that those kids are neurodivergent are extremely low....", "SIL would still be the asshole here because if your kid is neurodivergent you don't abdicate your full parenting responsibility to someone else and accuse them of being the problem", "SIL should have made reference to that if that were the case. Not doing so is just wild.", "Yep! I would wrap it in a beautiful box and give it to her on Christmas. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "100%. I agree that IF they reacted badly to something, the mother should have made OP aware.\n\nSince we weren't told about that, which is a fairly critical part of the story if they were autistic, I'm still assuming they are bratty kids. \n\nPlus given SIL attitude to the whole thing, it's pretty clear why they are bratty.", ">is a fairly critical part of the story if they were autistic\n\nTbh, it isn't. Even then, her mother is the one who was responsible for them. Actually, if they were autistic (which i seriously doubt, because autism is extremely rare) the mother is an even bigger AH."]}
