SIL has 3 kids ages 5, 7 and 9. My husband and I have two kids ages 8 and 4. SIL and I both work from home so we were both home all day when they were staying with us.\n\nSo here's what happened. She asked if I would cook for all the kids vs us each cooking for our respective kids. I told her sure but explained to her how my kids eat and wanted to know whether she wanted them on the same schedule or whether she wanted a typical three meals deal. She said to feed them three meals.\n\nFor context on how I feed my kids. We do smaller meal sizes but eating more often. So pre-meal snacks are big in our family. Seconds are also a thing if we have a \"hungry day\". I also try to mix in a lot of different choices week to week so food is still enjoyable.\n\nI know her kids' likes and dislikes with food so I took those into consideration when making food. But the kids did not want to eat the stuff I was making. They were upset it wasn't pizza or burgers or they were upset about tacos I make at home vs takeout ones. The kids dug in their heels and said I needed to give them food they wanted. I told SIL and she would go to feed them. Then she'd get mad that I hadn't given them the food they wanted. I asked her if she wanted to take over feeding her kids and she said no.\n\nIt got to the point where the kids stopped coming to the table at meal times. Since SIL was aware of this I just let it go because I felt like she would make them come to the table if she was upset by them not eating much. They were in the office with her sometimes when we were eating.\n\nThe day they were going back home she turned to me and told me I should be ashamed of myself for letting her kids go without food. My husband told her she was here the whole time and should have done more. He also pointed out we did them a favor and she was acting very ungrateful. \n\nA couple of weeks later she sent me a text saying yet again I should be ashamed and how could I refuse to accommodate children. I told SIL it wasn't my job to make her kids eat and that I had communicated with her while this was ongoing but she ignored me and expected me to bend over backward for them. She accused me of cruelty to kids and told me I was an ass for thinking it wasn't my job to make sure children under my roof were eating enough.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703176675, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nr590/aita_for_telling_my_sil_it_wasnt_my_job_to_make/", "score": 2203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I do feel like I may have been an AH is because it might sound a little cold to speak about kids not really eating. They're all young (SILs children) and I'm an adult and I knew they weren't eating but I left it for SIL to deal with. And then I dismiss any responsibility for it.

They should have been responsible for feeding their own kids . . . especially since they noted a problem with the kids not liking the food. She was an ass for not taking care of her own kids. It wasn't like you had weird food . . . you had good food and lots of it and plenty of offerings. It is better for kids to have plenty of healthy snacks. She has a problem . . .  if she doesn't understand that she is the one responsible for her own kids.", "NTA - Holy entitlement, Batman.", "Nta\nHer kids, her responsibility to see that they ate and were good guests. Her blame and anger are misplaced, she needs to turn that shame back on herself and own her own failure as a mother. She even shoved prep off onto you!", "[removed]", "Nta", "Nta\n\nNever help them in any capacity again.", "NTA, the timing says it all OP. Clearly the problem wasn't big enough to warrant leaving and getting a hotel for. Funny how it was only worth saying something *after* SIL made the most of the free accommodation. \n\nDon't do her any more favours OP, SIL is an ungrateful mooch.", "Nope", "NTA. Your SIL is absolutely wrong on this. Maybe if she taught her children better eating habits and better manners she wouldn\u2019t be in this situation. IMO I wouldn\u2019t give her a second thought and if she asks you to to help her out again site these reasons why you are saying no way.", "I bet nobody starved.", "Not sure why you agreed to such a crazy plan in the first place.", "If anyone should be ashamed, it is her for neglecting her kids. She was not prevented from accessing the kitchen or food she would have liked to buy, prepare and serve her children, yet she chose not to. She had options, she consistently abstained from feeding her kids. She owes you an apology, I would not extend any additional resources her way. Those kids had plenty of opportunities to eat food in your house, they opted out and she did nothing, how her family functions is not your responsibility; you and your family went above and beyond. Shame on her indeed.", "Did you tell her she was an ass for expecting you to further cater to her fuckery when you were already allowing them to invade your home", "NTA\n\nAnd claiming you neglected/abused her kids would mean never being around her and her kids alone ever again. Hold on to all of her messages and document the sh\\*t out of everything. CYA!", "NTA i want to acknowledge that it was very kind of you to take on feeding your SIL's kids simply bc she didn't want to do it. But I would have stopped immediately the first time she pulled this crap. What an incredibly entitled woman raising entitled children.", "Wait. So, she gets to carry on her normal life, in your home, minus the responsibility of preparing food for her own children, at her request, aware of the situation of picky eating, and somehow YOU let her kids go hungry? She waited until the day they left to start shit, never remedied the situation while she was there, and you're the asshole? Not even. She's a shit mom, a shit guest, and a shit person if she thinks her gripe is even remotely valid. \n\nNTA.", "Point out that the food was there for them to eat. They simply chose to not eat.\n\nNTA", "Nope.  NTA but your SIL sure is an entitled one.  Sounds like all she feeds her kids is fast food - hope they don't all develop diabetes soon.", "NTA.  The kids had more than adequate and nourishing food and they chose not to eat it.  Their problem.  The only thing I could see would have been to be stricter on the matter, but your SIL should have done that too.", "Sounds to me like she doesn\u2019t cook at home so their little brains are deprived of nutrients from a fast food diet. Poor neglected things.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband's right - her kids, her responsibility.", "Here's an idea OP.  Ban SIL from coming to your house for any reason, because she's such a lazy asshole.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou did bend over backwards it was HER kids that refused because they are spoiled and then she had the audacity to blame you for it... I think if ever they even visit you let her know that there will be no food for her family unless she brings it with her even if you all are planning a family dinner that way all are safe", "Nta but sil sure is...", "nta as a picky eater myself there were plenty times where i would refuse to eat but i always understood it was MY decision not to eat just like the kids had the choice to eat what u made for them. hearing ur sil say u should be ashamed while also doing nothing to feed her children is wild.", "The way I see it, there are 3 options:\n\n1) They can eat the food you graciously took the time to make them while taking into consideration their food preferences and say thank you.\n\n2) If take out is all they want to eat, then their own mother can.provide that.\n\n3) They can go hungry.\n\nETA:  You are NTA", "NTA", "The lazy b will never stay with me\u2026.again.", "NTA \n\nHowever I think communication could be better here as kids might not be communicating the situation clearly. \n\nFood was provided, they just refused it. \n\nAnything beyond that isn\u2019t really what you agreed upon.", "Tell your SIL that it is not your fault her kids have oppositional eating disorder.", "NTA but let that be the last favor you ever do for her.", "Your sister in law is an asshole and an enabler. They won't eat? Fine, no food. They will eat eventually.", "NTA - If the kids were actually hungry they would have at least tried to eat the meals which were cooked.

It's you're roof, your house.\n\nNo-one is responsible for feeding and housing anyone else except their own kids.", "Probably not.", "It seems like what she really wanted was to get out of parenting her kids more than just cooking. It takes a lot to get little ones to sit and eat you can\u2019t just show them food and expect them to manage the whole process independently", "I agree that she didn't want the responsibility. I feel like we're missing some context. If the kids are old enough to snub home cooked meals for take-out or fast food, it seems like there would already be a meal time routine in place. Also, to shame OP on their way out and again by text is very strange. Most people would intervene the moment they feel their child is being mistreated.\n\nEdit:typo", ">That statement makes it seem like you don't live in a place with taco trucks or good, real Mexican restaurants.\n\nI live in one of the major cities in Michigan and yes we do have \"real\" Mexican restaurants in our city.

When I said homemade tacos was better than, I indeed was thinking of Taco Bell.  I don't even go to Taco Bell."]}
