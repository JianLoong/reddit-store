My son is already off at school and doing very well, and Sam was accepted into her desired college school and program, my mom promised to pay for her entire education along time ago, including tuition and accommodation. Everyone was overjoyed with this. \n\nHowever, after my divorce several years ago, Sam started to prioritize my ex-wife\u2019s family during every season, Sam decided to visit her mom's side of the family instead of spending time with mine. We always told there\u2019s a lot more people there and the food is so much better. Can\u2019t argue with the fact that her extended family was there, but I don\u2019t think an hour with grandparents is asking too much. This all upset my mother and strained their relationship. Two weeks ago, she called me to tell me that she would no longer be paying for Sam\u2019s education. She felt that Sam had put her own family second and didn\u2019t treat her like she mattered at all. I hate to say it, but I also can\u2019t argue with that. \n\nSince then, Sam has taken full view of what college is going to look like for her. She will likely need to rethink her dream school and major. On top of that the loans will be an anchor in her life. She asked me to help, and I certainly will when I can, but when her mother and I divorced, she got all the college accounts and used that to fund her house. This is old news, but I feel very relevant. \n\nWhile I feel bad for my daughter, I do not feel responsible for my mother's actions. She made the choice to stop supporting Sam\u2019s education, and I cannot force her to change her mind. I have spoken to my mother and tried to reason with her, but she is firm in her decision. I have also told Sam that she brought this on herself for treating her grandmother less than the rest of her family. \n\nSam is understandably upset and feels like she is being punished for wanting to spend time with her mom's side of the family. However, I believe that she is old enough to understand the consequences of her actions and make decisions for herself. As a parent, I have always taught my children to take responsibility for their choices, and I feel that this situation is no different.\n\nSo, Reddit, Am I The Asshole here?

There was a college fund in place for her that your ex-wife misused through no fault of your own as giving it over to her was court-ordered. Your daughter was given warning that her grandmother was upset and was going to stop considering her family after repeatedly choosing your ex's family over yours and even going so far as to let your ailing mother show up to pick her up for an agreed upon outing, to her not being home and not going.\n\nYour son has continued to spend time with grandma and doesn't imply that your family is too boring to visit like your daughter has, so he has earned the privilege of your mother's gift. He put in the work to maintain the relationship and is being rewarded for it. She didn't.\n\nYour daughter is learning a very expensive lesson early in life that you can't take people for granted and still feel entitled to support from them. Even if she starts visiting Grandma daily from now until graduation, your mother will know that she's only using her for the money now, so it won't mean as much. Your daughter has burned a bridge because she wasn't willing to sacrifice a few hours here and there to stay close with one of the few family members who was actually willing to pay a life-changing amount of money towards her future.\n\nIt sounds like you tried to warn her multiple times while still giving her space to make decisions for herself as she's been inching closer to adulthood... and she decided to ignore you and is now paying the price. She wanted to be treated like an adult to make her own decisions on who she visited but now doesn't want to deal with the adult responsibilities for those choices. At this point she needs to be asking her mother about the college fund she got in the divorce and how she plans to make up for it being gone now.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the upvotes and awards! I hope OP finds a way to make this a learning moment for his daughter and that she can rebuild the relationship with her grandmother with no expectation of money coming to her.", "NTA.  Your ex needs to refund her college account.  I don\u2019t understand why no one has issues with the fact she misappropriated her college find so extended family could have a free house.", "NTA. You tried to talk to your mom on her behalf and that didn't work. And her mom used her college money to buy a house. A lesson to others  - put the money in a 579 fund so that it cannot be taken out by the parents for their own use. A lesson for your daughter, she is not entitled to any money from grandma if she ghosts her and spends all her time with the otther side of the family. My kids were written out of my mother's will because they never visited her.", "NTA\n\nThe only person who should be equally responsible for Sam's college education finance is her mother.  Particularly because she used that fund to buy her house.  That completely makes her mom the AH here.\n\nWhile it was great that your mom offered to pay for Sam's college, that is 100% your mom's decision, not yours.\n\nYou tried to reason with your mom to no avail.  There really isn't anything else you can do here.  I'm sure you're helping where you can, financially.  But you can only do what you can.\n\nI agree with your mom here.  If Sam completely neglected seeing her grandparents, they have every right not to give that person a penny.", "NTA. Sam is facing the consequences of basically cutting her grandmother out of her life, as very few people wants to pay for a strangers education. \n\nYou tried to speak with both Sam and your mother and they both used their free will to do what they wanted.\n\nThere was a college fund, but Sam\u2019s mom used it to buy a house. \n\nI suggest Sam take up her lack of funds with your ex. Get her to pay her back what was in her fund.", "NTA\u2026 your daughter made her bed she can sleep on it", "NTA. Some of these comments are wild though. \n\nGrandma can choose to give her money to, and it\u2019s not your place to tell her what to do with it. Once she can deal with the consequences. Cause even if she does choose to pay for your daughters tuition, more than likely she isn\u2019t going to forget this, and their relationship will forever be strained. \n\nI understand your daughter though. I\u2019m good with both my parents side family, but there\u2019s one side that I\u2019m much closer to. Still love the other side, but it just happens. \n\nYour ex wife is the real AH.

What did Sam think was going to happen if she ignored Grandma?", "NTA.

She is making adult level decisions that come with consequences.", "Nah I don't understand why Sam would want to spend time with the person who stole her college fund though ...does she know", "NTA.  Your daughter was warned by her Grandmother, she ignored those warnings.  You spoke to your Mum about it, you actually had college funds but your ex spent that money on a bigger house for her extended family, even though she had one large enough for her immediate family.  Since the divorce you have saved what you could, which is reasonable.  There is nothing more you can do, your daughter is unfortunately facing the consequences of her actions, you don't get to pretty much ignore someone and then expect them to fork out the amount of money needed for a college education.  It's on your wife who spent the original college money on something that wasn't needed to work out.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your daughter was warned about the possible consequences and now she's living those consequences.

You shouldn't try to replace all of the monetary support your daughter lost.", "NAH. \n\nAs you said, this was your mothers decision, not yours, and a result of how Sam has prioritized visits.\n\nEdit: Meant to say NAH not N.T.A. cuz I don\u2019t really think your daughters choices make her the asshole but these are the consequences and that\u2019s life.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nDaughter can't expect tens of thousands of dollars from someone she neglects.  Grandma has no obligation to pay either.  You did what you could, I doubt forcing your daughter to hang out with grandma would've improved their relationship much. It sucks but she'll have to live with the consequences and hope the other half of the family can help her out.", "NTA. The court ordered that your kids' college funds go to your ex, and she spent them on a house rather than saving them for your children's college as they were intended. Your daughter chose to spend holidays and major events with her mother's family and not yours. Your mother chose to rescind her offer of paying for college since your daughter chose to spend so little time/ have so little contact with her. While you could have force your daughter to see your family, you didn't, giving your daughter the ability to make her own decisions. She now doesn't like the result of her decision, and blames you and her grandmother, when really she should be blaming herself and her own mother for not having college funds.", "So Sam got her college fund, and spent it on a house. It\u2019s quite cruel to expect an elderly grandmother to pay her expenses whilst not even giving her the time of day.\n\nNTA", "Info: Were the strings attached to the financial support made clear to Sam?", "NTA. Your mother isn't The Bank of Grandma. If your daughter really alienated your parents that much in favor of your ex-in laws, I don't see how either of you are TA, to be honest.", "NTA. Only AH is her mother for taking that money and spending it elsewhere. If she wants her tuition paid for, OP is well within their rights to point her in that direction. OP has already fulfilled their duty by saving up that money before, and Grandma has absolutely no obligation to pay, especially given the way OP's daughter treats her.", "NTA. Sam is in the midst of a great big FAFO of her own making.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your daughter made her bed now she can lie on it. I\u2019m this is what happens. When we push family away, our actions have consequences.  The good thing is you will still help her. The bad thing it will not be the one she chose. I bet she\u2019s also cut out of the inheritance. Again, Sam was a jerk to your mother. She knows what she\u2019s doing by choosing sides rather than stay neutral and visit everyone equally.  Also, setting an appointment with grandma and then disappearing really hurts. Her actions told her grandmother she didn\u2019t care. \nRemember she neglected your grandmother. When we neglect a person we tell them they don\u2019t exist. So sad.", "ESH. Here's another example of why \"college money\" should be put into a specific financial product designed for education expenses: to prevent issues like 1) Mom using the cash to buy a house; and 2) Grandma deciding not to pay out at all, on a whim.\n\nSo yeah, the \"getting more involved\" on your part should have been opening a 529 fund (or whatever similar college-fund financial product) when your mother first offered. It would have been in your name designated for your daughter, with your mother's money.", "> Should have I gotten more involved?\n\nHow could you had gotten more involved?", "ESH yes you should have been more vocal in getting your daughter to spend time with family and saving after the divorce. However the fact that her mother spent her college saving needs to be looked into. Was this part of the divorce & custody agreement for her to maintain this account for your daughter? I\u2019d be speaking with your lawyer on your daughter behalf.", "NAH except maybe Grandma.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's a hell of a thing to take away with no warning.", "YTA. Your daughter is being punished for decisions she made as a minor that should have been managed by you. If you wanted your daughter to have a flourishing relationship with her grandmother while still a minor, you needed to insist on regular visits to facilitate that.\n\nHowever, given that your mother would be so vindictive as to revoke a promise  made to a child right before she is preparing to attend college, perhaps there is more to why she didn't want to see the grandmother in the first place.", "Grandma is TA. She shouldn't have said she was paying for the college without clearly stating her requirements. If her requirements was to have weekly dinner then she should have told grandkid.", "So Grandma is going to let her granddaughter start her adult life with a debt anchor around her neck because for a couple of years she didn\u2019t make her feel important enough? Parents and grandparents are supposed to love their kids and grandkids unconditionally. That responsibility is not on the kid\u2014it\u2019s on the adult. \n\nSam is a teenager, a kid. Kids aren\u2019t generally known for making great choices. As a teenager, she\u2019s also just starting to understand her own independence. Sure, she could\u2019ve prioritized grandma a little more, but the punishment clearly doesn\u2019t fit the crime here. As a child of divorced parents, she\u2019s also got a lot of adults she feels pressured to please. You can\u2019t hang this all on her. \n\nUltimately, YTA if you\u2019re not on Sam\u2019s side in this. Not in the sense that you say she bears zero responsibility, but in the sense that you\u2019re looking out for her long term future\u2014both for college and her family relationships. \n\nSomebody needs to be the grownup in the room. That\u2019s not the teenager\u2019s job and apparently Grandma can\u2019t or won\u2019t do it\u2014so it\u2019s up to you. I hope you can find a way to help them reconcile so she doesn\u2019t start out life with a debt anchor around her neck and their relationship (and possibly yours) isn\u2019t forever damaged.", "YTA\n\nSo you weren't saving anything since the divorce for her collage, you were entirely relying on your mother? Her mother paid for a house she and the kids lived in and you stopped saving?\n\nI'm just shocked at how cruel and indifferent you are to your daughter having her whole life plan ripped away from her. \n\nAnd your mother, she promised to pay for collage and now just before it's due to start she pulls the offer.\n\nYou say consequences have actions but are you ok with accepting the consequences of your actions?", "YTA and you aren\u2019t teaching your daughter anything but it\u2019s okay to make promises and break them and that relationships are transactional. If your side of the family is so big on consequences than what\u2019s going to be your mothers for lying to your daughter about paying for school(she gave no stipulations so your daughter deserves what was promised to her) and breaking a promise. It\u2019s nothing wrong with allowing consequences to take place but in this situation your mother should be learning that as well. I\u2019d never allow anyone to treat my kids differently and cause discourse between me and them. Do you think that that\u2019s apart of why she didn\u2019t want to come around. It\u2019s okay if you want to teach cause and effect but you need to stand on that fully and that would also be holding your mother accountable for not being a woman of her word.", "Grandma is TA here. Is it any wonder your daughter doesn't want to spend time with her? She has made their relationship transactional. Has she invited Sam over when it is not a holiday? You say an hour is not too much but would that hour take place in the middle of a large family event? Does your mom stop by to just say hi? Invite Sam to lunch?", "YTA. Good job parenting. You should have gotten involved when your 10 year old stopped spending time with your side of the family, not left that choice to a child. Ever hear of custody orders that divide the child\u2019s time between parents? Did you enforce the custody order so that when it was your time, Sam was with you? Did you take your child to see her grandparents when you had custody? What did you do to foster a relationship between your young child & her grandparents? Did you take an hour out of your life to bring Sam to see her grandma? \n\nYou say that you always made sure that \u201ctheir education is a top priority\u201d. How exactly did you do that? By turning all of your kid\u2019s college fund over to someone else & doing nothing when that person spent the money on something else?

There is genuinely nothing in your control here regarding the money and you gave your daughter warnings.

Clearly ex-wife should pay for her college or at least refund what she stole from her", "Agree NTA\n\nThe mother plundered the college account. She should remortgage to pay it back.", "It's a 529 plan, not 579. And people can still steal a kid's college fund if they have no scruples. It happened to my son. His father was supposed to continue paying for our son's prepaid college plan. Right before our son's senior year in high school, I inquired about the plan to try to plan for other expenses that it wouldn't cover. I discovered that he had cancelled the plan 7 years earlier and received a refund. \n\nI had to get a lawyer to enforce our court order and he ended up having to put enough money into a 529 to cover what the prepaid plan would have plus pay my legal fees. But it took close to a year to resolve and became very nasty, which he took out on our son. It was ugly. \n\nThen 6 years later, when our son went to file his taxes for his first real job, his refund was taken by the IRS and he was told he owed close to $50k in back taxes and penalties - from his father taking the prepaid plan refund since our son's social security number was on the plan. So, I guess I'm saying that even a 529 plan doesn't necessarily protect the child if the other parent is a thief. So, yeah, OP should probably help daughter go after mom for the stolen college fund, but he should expect it to get very nasty and there is no guarantee his daughter will actually get the money.", "Even if Sam wanted to spend time with her mother's family,  she could have visited grandma other times and could have called her on a regular basis.

Then she offers to take her granddaughter to get her nails done, a fun activity and her granddaughter says yes! She's excited, she's so happy to get to spend this time with her. Maybe this can be their thing. Then she pulls up to the house and her granddaughter doesn't come out. Isn't even there, blew her off again. You don't think that hurt? You don't think a seventeen year old wouldn't know that would hurt someone? She didn't even have the respect for someone else's feelings to call and say sorry, plans changed.

If Dad tried to make her visit his family, she could have done this (not saying she did, but it's definitely not cut and dry that he could just make her visit Grandma with no repercussions if mom didn't encourage it as well).

So now if she wants to go to college as per the plans that were made based on promises set when she was a kid, she's got to perform.

That's an asshole move on your mother's part. \n3. How much per year are we talking? I'm assuming b/c you seem to be financially secure, she likely didn't qualify for any financial aid... what's the yearly tuition? And what's the dream program--are we talking \"I want to major in creative writing\" or \"I'm going to be an engineer\"... b/c those things factor into how advisable it is to take on large amounts of debt (though really it's NEVER advisable, but I digress)\n\nAll this is to say, I want to pass on some advice that might help you be a good parent to your daughter as you try to help triage this--b/c I'd also say you'd be the asshole if you're not there to support her and offer some solutions in the face of what is devastating for her (regardless of whether she brought this upon herself).\n\nIf she's looking at 6 figures of college debt, she needs to first a) appeal to the financial aid department of the college and see if they'll reevaluate her aid offer but as that likely won't help if you make a lot of money b) take a gap year. If she did ED for a school, this means withdrawing her acceptance--it's not easy to do, but she'll have to claim financial hardship with the school (but they may push back on family assets btw).  You're really not supposed to back out of ED, but oh well. If this is an EA or RD situation and she's not committed to the school yet, great. She'll need to decline. It's going to hurt her soul. But...\n\nShe'll need to take a gap year and basically start all over again with college admissions with an entirely new strategy. That new strategy is based on \"I cannot afford to pay for college but my parents make too much to get financial aid\"--she needs to start over with a new, realistic budget (ie: how much, if anything can you contribute, etc.) and evaluate her strengths and apply with merit aid in mind. There will be opportunities for her being biracial with Hispanic heritage; she's considered an under represented minority in college admissions and should be able to use that to her advantage strategically. If she's a half decent student, there is no reason she wouldn't be an attractive candidate at many schools. It's critical to apply early to schools who give merit aid--the whole reason she's screwed now is all the money is gone, so even if she appeals to the school, if they didn't offer her any, they won't magically be able to give her a full ride.\n\nFrankly, I'd encourage her to do some real soul searching about this entire situation and if she can gain some clarity/growth this would make a stunning college admissions essay. But only if she has actual maturity and growth about it. During her gap year, I'd encourage her to get a job or do something similarly productive so she's not just taking a vacation for the year. Maybe she'll manage to mend her relationship with her grandmother. I wish her the best as this whole situation sucks. This will be a learning experience for sure.\n\nSo yeah: she needs a new plan.

So if OP got 50% of the assets to use (for example a house and a small account) and ex got 50% (both college accounts and the car) this would mean that ex was expected to use the share of assets she got in the divorce to wholly fund the education.  College funding should have been worked out again after divorce with both parents contributing.", "Overall I very much agree. The one part I'm struggling with is that Grandma decided to announce shortly after a lot of college deadlines had passed.\n\nThis doesn't reflect on OP, but if Grandma wants to rescind her promise of support, she should at least have shared this information early enough that decisions about what schools to apply to could be made with the correct financial information in mind. There might be other choices of what school to apply to that daughter could have made if she were aware that college is not going to be covered that are now closed to her due to deadlines.\n\nMaybe it was just that the reality of hearing about the admissions decision is what made Grandma realize that she can't bring herself to pay for this, but... Basically, I support Grandma's right to respond to the fact that she isn't being treated like family, but the way it was carried out leaves a lot to be desired.", "This is the only comment you need to read OOP. \n\nU/mindovermuses really organized your situation paragraph by paragraph.

It was almost like he was accusing me of something. I told him I had no idea and offered to help him pay for a lawyer to help get it straightened out. He must have asked his father after that and somehow worked it out with a lawyer. It was a few years after that when he told me what the cause of the refund being held was.

OP said that he's an only child, so there aren't any cousins or large extended family for their get-togethers. Daughter seems to have taken her paternal grandmother for granted, even when her brother did not, and is now paying the price for not taking the warnings that grandma would soon no longer consider her family seriously.\n\nI mean, imagine it from grandma's POV. Her only child gives her two grandchildren that she already rarely gets to see because of the divorce. She loves them enough to want to provide a college fund in addition to the one their parents had set up for them. She then watches as her former daughter-in-law plunder that college savings on an unnecessary new house. To make matters worse, she has to repeatedly hear from her granddaughter (indirectly) that she isn't fun or good enough to spend time with. Then, when she finally gets the granddaughter to agree to go get their nails done together, she gets herself ready and drives out to pick her up and granddaughter isn't there and never told her she had changed her mind about the outing. This entire time, her grandson has visited her regularly and not taken her for granted, so it's hard not to take this personally. She gives granddaughter a warning that she's tired of being mistreated and will soon no longer think of her as family- which should have been a big warning flag that the college fund she had set aside for her grandchildren would go away for her- and granddaughter blows it off and continues the way she's been acting. Now that she's realized her mother stole one of her college funds and that she ruined her relationship with her grandmother, the daughter is upset that she can't afford her dream school and might have to take out loans- like a good portion of the population has to in order to attend college in the US.", "sam brought this upon herself. OP and his mother are not in the wrong here, at all. if sam wants to go no contact that\u2019s her issue, and she should always remember that she caused this. thinking your grandma is a bank is incredibly entitled and selfish, not to mention absolving your own mother of blame when she used your college money to fund a house for her new family. sam is 17 not 10, she knows that actions have consequences.\n\nyou\u2019re acting like OP and his mother should live in guilt for their near-adult daughter\u2019s own life choices. sam and her mother should be the ones feeling guilty. she has ruined this relationship so badly that even if she tried to make amends her grandma will feel like it\u2019s all to get the money back.", "What always befuddles me is that basic sympathy is a thing. I spent loads of time with my grandparents as a teen, not because I was obligated to, but because I cared for them. From OP's account, Sam just decided to ignore his mom after the divorce. You don't need to be an adult to know that that is unfair. Why should grandma care for Sam when Sam clearly doesn't care in return? And if we argue that Sam didn't spend time with grandma just because she wasn't fond of her, that's perfectly fine. But then Sam shouldn't expect a penny from her either.", "Have you ever asked why your daughter doesn't like going to her grandma? I think a hint could be taken from that comment \"she liked having another woman in the family\". Maybe grandma expected your daughter to be certain way and she didn't like it?\n\nHow much more frequently your son visited grandma compared to your daughter?\n\nAlso you act like this doesn't affect you. But it does, your mother said she was taking care of that huge expense. From then on you and your wife stopped thinking you would have to do it. That is why you were not so worried about getting her money. That is why you didn't care your ex used that money to something else. And now she springs this on you.\n\nMy grandma hated my guts, and she was nice to my sibling, given them money, etc. My grandma always made awful comments about my mom. I always hated that, and I never let it pass. She either did that less in front of my sibling or they didn't care, but in any case we never got along. Of course I never expected to receive anything from her. However I can see how a dumb 16th year old could fail to do the math if grandma promised the money. Also my grandma was quite misogynistic, so I can imagine how a grandma could treat a grandson in quite a better way than a granddaughter.\n\nI think you need to understand what is really the reason why your daughter has become stranged from your mother. Normally children love grandparents that are nice to them. Of course teens are known to be idiots sometimes so we can not discard that option.\n\nIn any case this is your daughter. She is 17, she made those \"decisions\" when she was what? 15? She is underage. It is your job to help her. So help her. It doesn't mean you have to force your mom to pay anything. Your mom has her own will. Help your daughter to deal with the issues. How to make a plan to get to the school she wants. Even getting loans If you saved money like you said, it should be possible. This is not her thing to deal alone with. If you guys had college funds and your ex used them for something else, she also needs to help your daughter. Help your daughter, she is scared and she doesn't know how to deal with this situation. A parent job is to help their children navigate this kind of situation. If you have no idea you can also search for information. There are also many kind of scholarships. Work with her.\n\nIn any case, as an adult if I promised my grandchild money for college, even If they were jerks I wouldn't pull the money all of the sudden. I just couldn't imagine doing that to a stupid teen. I couldn't live with my conscience. Your daughter does visit them, just not as frequently as she wants. Has your daughter said to your mother face that she feels they are less than the other part of her family? I mean sometimes you get along better with certain people, ir doesn't mean they think you are less than.\n\nDo you know if racism could be the reason? I am not saying your grandma. But anyone of the people involved.\n\nYou are her father, you have to help her. You can't help what your mother did, she has her own will. But you can help what you do. Your daughter did something likely stupid from the information you provided. As a parent you have to help her deal with this situation. That doesn't mean forcing your mom help, it just means helping her search for alternatives, etc. Also means trying to understand why this happen. Maybe you should be upset. You don't seem to really know why your daughter doesn't like your mom, maybe there is a valid reason. If there is no valid reason, well you just tell her people have feelings and we don't get to use them as things.\n\nBasically you have to help your daughter. If you don't you will be an ah.

There is no Brady Bunch lesson learned in the dying moments of an episode here.  \n\nSure yeah, OP and his mother can treat this as a lesson they're teaching a kid.  It'll be the last one - OP's mother is unlikely to have a relationship with Sam after this, and OP stands a very high chance of losing Sam as well.

You think you're teaching them a lesson, they're learning who they want to consider family.\n\nYou can't treat your kids like they're forever 5 and everything can eventually be sorted out after the crying is done.  Sam's 17 years old and she's been now given the reason for never talking, spending time with or interacting with her father's side of the family ever again.  Even if OP's mother walks that back, damage has already been done - Sam's going to assume anything from that side of the family comes with strings attached and performative requirements.   \n\nOP and his mother aren't the assholes but they've fucked up their relationship with Sam.  And it's just --- what's more important to you, as a parent.  Being right or your kid's trust? Like --- in effect, imagine having your kid just not trusting or relying on you, as a parent, because they think that at any moment you could not just abandon them but seriously damage their future because you don't like how they're acting.\n\nYou got kids? You imagine that then - that they're sitting there, thinking that they're going to have to drop out of school and get a job to pay for food and a roof over their head cause you calculated that they didn't eat enough meals with you and so they aren't worth paying for anymore.  Now you imagine how you'd sort that out with your kids.  How you'd go from that situation back to where they didn't think their entire future depended on performing for parental support.\n\nAnyway, good luck to OP.

Cherish your grandparents folks.", "Thank you for spelling out some of the actual logistics of this situation. Most of the posts here are just like \"screw her, she didn't visit grandma, she needed to be taught a lesson!\" If she has already applied and been accepted to a college program and having funding pulled at the last minute, this is seriously fucking up her entire life. But her dad is all \"shrug, oh well, you made your bed! Plus reddit said you deserved it!\"", "There are ways to protect an account like a parenting plan.  I assume OP and ex didn\u2019t do these and ex was likely given it as a part of division of the marital assets meaning that it counted against other funds she received from the divorce.  If so then **OP would have received assets in the divorce he wouldn\u2019t have if ex didn\u2019t get the college accounts**.  \n\nSomething like the family home, if this is the case then realistically college funding should have been redivided between the parents post divorce with both contributing.", "FINALLY someone with some sense. Who actually does that to a child right before college?\n\nAnd why I do I feel like dad\u2019s attitude is a way to punish his daughter for \u201cfavoring her mom\u201d?", "But wtf is he going to realistically do other than tell her, \"that sucks, I'll  help as much as I can\"?", "He did work with his ex to send their daughter to college. His ex took the money that had been saved and spent it on herself after the divorce. \n\nHis mother graciously agreed to pay for college as a result. The daughter has seemingly spent 7 years ignoring her and favouring the side of the family who stole the original fund. I don\u2019t agree with it being a transactional thing, but I can understand why the grandmother would be put out and decide to withdraw the offer.", "So relationships with loved ones are purely transactional? Is that really love?", "'She stopped showing up for big things awhile back. She never accepted an invitation for lunch or dinner. I remember mom asked her if she wanted to go get their nails done and she agreed but wasn\u2019t home the day she showed up to pick her up'.\n\nGrandma literally went out of her way to spend time with Sam, only to be ghosted. Stop painting Sam out to be a victim, not when she's just entitled.", "OP cannot force his mom to fund his daughter's college.   It is grandma's money and she can do what she wants with it.  Ex wife needs to refund all the money plus interest that she took out of daughter's college fund", "Yeah but what was the exs thought process back then? \"I'm taking ALL of the money after the divorce and I'm using ALL of the money to buy myself a nice house. My kids will go to college fck knows how.\"\n\nEven if it wasn't officially a college fund and just a regular savings account its still the exs fault.", "I'm sure all this time spent prioritizing mom over dad is not going to let her accept that her mom is at fault for anything.", "Unfortunately I can see a few undesirable character traits shared by the OP's ex and his daughter - both are selfish, entitled, irresponsible, and show callous disregard for others.\n\nI suspect OP's ex manipulated their daughter into turning against his mother because it deflected attention from the fact she spent their daughter's entire college fund. If so, I think OP will find he can't win. If he ignores the problem then his daughter won't learn that lesson. However giving his daughter some home truths about her behaviour won't work either, because his ex will sweet-talk her daughter into continuing to blame others for the consequences of her selfishness - which means they both get to play the victim.\n\nHis ex will sabotage his daughter's ability to learn from her mistakes because doing so both lets her off the hook for spending the college fund, and turns their daughter against OP and his family - a win-win for the ex.", "> Sam's basically just been told that her paternal grandmother no longer considers her a grandchild.\n\nAfter telling her grandma for years she doesn't consider herself to be her grandchild", "NTA.\n She spent all her time with her mom\u2019s family and they stole her college fund. She spent no time with her dad\u2019s family who wanted to gift her a college fund. Hmm maybe priorities towards those who are kind are in order. \u201cFun\u201d people can still rob you.", "Sounds like you and your cousins are all genuinely lovely! I love this! Good on them and you for being a lovely supportive family!", "Not really. She hasn't offered to pay if her granddaughter visits her sufficiently often. She has simply declined to help financially after her granddaughter decided to act like she didn't exist and wasn't worth keeping promises to.", "I think OP's son now stands to benefit even more from his gran. Now she's not spending money on her granddaughter's college education, she has some money for the deposit on her grandson's first house or apartment.", "You forger that the son still saw the grandmother so I don't think this is necessaraly true.", "OP said this in a comment:\n\n>She stopped showing up for big things awhile back. She never accepted an invitation for lunch or dinner. I remember mom asked her if she wanted to go get their nails done and she agreed but wasn\u2019t home the day she showed up to pick her up\n\nThat doesn't really sound like Sam has no control over what she does, or with whom; not to mention her brother always managed to make time for grandma. Sure, being a teenager sucks, but you can't ignore your grandmother and then expect her to write you a check for college. People don't work like that.", "Did Sam?\n\nFrom OP's comments, Sam was speaking to her grandmother (calls went from daily when she was younger to weekly/fortnightly as she became a teenager) and it doesn't sound like she didn't see her, just not at major holidays.  Sam's also 17 years old.  So unless this all happened this year, her final year of high school, then the vast majority of these major events would have been while she was underage (i.e. these are events that her parents should have been managing and had custody discussions over).\n\nThere was only one mention from OP about a missed organised event his mother had with Sam - I'm assuming that this can't be the sole thing that made his mother lose her temper, but even with all this it doesn't sound like Sam had gone no contact with her paternal grandmother.  It sounds like she was a teenager.\n\nRegardless though, all of this has guaranteed that Sam will be not considering her paternal family or grandmother in any future life plans she has.  So you know - self fulfilling prophecy and all that.", "You\u2019re getting downvoted by people who think grandmamah can just make promises she doesn\u2019t keep. It\u2019s super f-ed up. OP shouldn\u2019t just stand by when he can help his daughter out. The daughter is *just* getting this news when she could have been preparing for years. It\u2019s reprehensible for a person to deny someone a promise on because they feel resentful \n\n\nAlso, why isn\u2019t he more involved in his daughter\u2019s life?", "OP \"...my mom promised to pay for her entire education along time ago, including tuition and accommodation.\"\n\nThe grandmother is pulling out of a promise she made to a child.", "This. My grandparents never saw this with their narc gc daughter (my aunt) as she just stringed them along while my late mom did everything for them (even though mom wasn't much better as she did yell at me a couple of times to \"not embarrass\" her to get us kicked out of the will). It was a mess. Money and personal greed can cause rifts and show people's true colors. NTA.", "You can't treat people badly and expect them to still always have your best interest and happiness in mind.", "So you would be ok paying thousands of dollars for someone after they went NC with you because you weren't fun enough.", "Sam isn't treating grandma like a bank. Grandma is acting like she was buying/investing affection all along.", "He said that his son continued to split his time and spend time with his grandparents.", "OP is the hispanic one my dudes, so yikes on the daughter preferring to be with the white people.", "Glad this dumb comment got down voted to hell lmao", "It probably wasn't that nuanced.  Here's a savings account with $X in it, some of which is earmarked for college money for the kids.  Judge: Ok, wife gets all of that as part of the split of marital property.  It might have been intended for college, but until the day you write the check, it's just money in the bank, free to use by the account holders for whatever they want.  They could have set up that money in a 529 instead, and that would have made it much easier to separate from other marital assets at the time of the divorce.  But that's not how it went, so be it.", "I think you may be missing the point overall. I don't think the grandma ever expects a real relationship at this stage and withdrawing support is the signifier that she's fully run out of patience and given up.", "I don't get why more people don't see grandma as being disgusting and petty. She only has 2 grandchildren but is now only paying for 1 of their futures. I expect better behavior from the actual adults in this situation. A grandmother should unconditionally love all her grandchildren and hope for their successes. She is reneging on a promise made to a child years ago and is now emotionally and financially blackmailing her. If you think Sam is treating her grandmother like a bank it's because grandma set the tone as a transaction all along.\n\nOP is NTA but his mother and ex-wife are.  I expect another casualty here will be Sam's relationship with her brother who gets twice as much college money now plus a bonus of sibling resentment.", "I'm mostly surprised at how many people don't seem to have a problem with how this is definitely going to blow up OP's family (I mean I assume his family is his mother and his kids).\n\nHis relationship with Sam, Sam's relationship with his mother, Sam's older brother's relationship with all of them now he's the golden grandchild...  Like yeah sure, have a NTA but like, that's gonna be cold comfort given your kids are probably not going to have a normal sibling relationship any more after this, your daughter is definitely going to be estranged from your mother and probably you too and nobody's going to be attending any family events or hell speaking to each other for the next decade or so (if you're lucky, it could be forever given how this works).  \n\nThis is such a lose/lose/lose scenario.", "And she did it by blowing up not just her relationship with Sam but also the relationships between Sam, OP and her brother.\n\nPlus of course also doing it this year and at this time, in Sam's final year of high school at the the tail end of the year when it's already too late for Sam to have gone for scholarships or made alternate plans on how she'd do college.\n\nOP's mother can do whatever she wants with her money, she's not an asshole for that.  But her choices regardless of asshole status created the most lose/lose/lose scenario for everybody involved.  Like, not just her relationship with Sam, she blew up her son's, her grandson's, ensured estrangement, just broke up an entire family unit (that was already fractured due to the divorce)."]}
