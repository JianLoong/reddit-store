{"id": 11094, "submission_id": "11ds21u", "title": "AITA for not getting more involved in my daughters college fund situation?", "selftext": "I have two children, a daughter Sam (17f), and a son(19m), and I have always made sure that their education is a top priority. My son is already off at school and doing very well, and Sam was accepted into her desired college school and program, my mom promised to pay for her entire education along time ago, including tuition and accommodation. Everyone was overjoyed with this.\n\nHowever, after my divorce several years ago, Sam started to prioritize my ex-wife\u2019s family during every season, Sam decided to visit her mom's side of the family instead of spending time with mine. We always told there\u2019s a lot more people there and the food is so much better. Can\u2019t argue with the fact that her extended family was there, but I don\u2019t think an hour with grandparents is asking too much. This all upset my mother and strained their relationship. Two weeks ago, she called me to tell me that she would no longer be paying for Sam\u2019s education. She felt that Sam had put her own family second and didn\u2019t treat her like she mattered at all. I hate to say it, but I also can\u2019t argue with that.\n\nSince then, Sam has taken full view of what college is going to look like for her. She will likely need to rethink her dream school and major. On top of that the loans will be an anchor in her life. She asked me to help, and I certainly will when I can, but when her mother and I divorced, she got all the college accounts and used that to fund her house. This is old news, but I feel very relevant.\n\nWhile I feel bad for my daughter, I do not feel responsible for my mother's actions. She made the choice to stop supporting Sam\u2019s education, and I cannot force her to change her mind. I have spoken to my mother and tried to reason with her, but she is firm in her decision. I have also told Sam that she brought this on herself for treating her grandmother less than the rest of her family.\n\nSam is understandably upset and feels like she is being punished for wanting to spend time with her mom's side of the family. However, I believe that she is old enough to understand the consequences of her actions and make decisions for herself. As a parent, I have always taught my children to take responsibility for their choices, and I feel that this situation is no different.\n\nSo, Reddit, Am I The Asshole here? Should have I gotten more involved?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*edit\\* \n\nI think I am done here. I will be taking all you have had to say into account. I will speak to my mother and daughter once again. Together as one unit. I will make sure Sam knows how her actions have consequences and my mother as well, but perhaps neither of them are wrong. \n\nI want to point out how mean some of you are. I have lived in the States for many years now. It is not common for children or parents to act as if another is dead. Many of you keep saying \"don't be suprised when your child no longer speaks to you.\" Is this really common in your lives because to me it is unheard of. I talk to my children often. You really need to get in touch with the outside world. This online place is good for a lot, but please rememebr that it is a controlled enviroment..it is not real. \n\nOthers keep calling Sam a child. I assume this is cultural differences. To me, Sam is not a child and she has not been for awhile. She is not an adult but she is not a child either. We expect people to be aware of their actions. We let 16 year old drive cars which is very dangerous, 18 year olds fight wars, and leave 12 year olds in charge of toddlers for money. You need to really think of what age is to you. I guess that could be my culture though. I had to work when I was a child to bring money in for food. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all", "created_utc": 1677544911, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ds21u/aita_for_not_getting_more_involved_in_my/", "score": 5389, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was a college fund in place for her that your ex-wife misused through no fault of your own as giving it over to her was court-ordered. Your daughter was given warning that her grandmother was upset and was going to stop considering her family after repeatedly choosing your ex's family over yours and even going so far as to let your ailing mother show up to pick her up for an agreed upon outing, to her not being home and not going.\n\nYour son has continued to spend time with grandma and doesn't imply that your family is too boring to visit like your daughter has, so he has earned the privilege of your mother's gift. He put in the work to maintain the relationship and is being rewarded for it. She didn't.\n\nYour daughter is learning a very expensive lesson early in life that you can't take people for granted and still feel entitled to support from them. Even if she starts visiting Grandma daily from now until graduation, your mother will know that she's only using her for the money now, so it won't mean as much. Your daughter has burned a bridge because she wasn't willing to sacrifice a few hours here and there to stay close with one of the few family members who was actually willing to pay a life-changing amount of money towards her future.\n\nIt sounds like you tried to warn her multiple times while still giving her space to make decisions for herself as she's been inching closer to adulthood... and she decided to ignore you and is now paying the price. She wanted to be treated like an adult to make her own decisions on who she visited but now doesn't want to deal with the adult responsibilities for those choices. At this point she needs to be asking her mother about the college fund she got in the divorce and how she plans to make up for it being gone now.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the upvotes and awards! I hope OP finds a way to make this a learning moment for his daughter and that she can rebuild the relationship with her grandmother with no expectation of money coming to her.", "NTA.  Your ex needs to refund her college account.  I don\u2019t understand why no one has issues with the fact she misappropriated her college find so extended family could have a free house.", "NTA. You tried to talk to your mom on her behalf and that didn't work. And her mom used her college money to buy a house. A lesson to others  - put the money in a 579 fund so that it cannot be taken out by the parents for their own use. A lesson for your daughter, she is not entitled to any money from grandma if she ghosts her and spends all her time with the otther side of the family. My kids were written out of my mother's will because they never visited her.", "NTA\n\nThe only person who should be equally responsible for Sam's college education finance is her mother.  Particularly because she used that fund to buy her house.  That completely makes her mom the AH here.\n\nWhile it was great that your mom offered to pay for Sam's college, that is 100% your mom's decision, not yours.\n\nYou tried to reason with your mom to no avail.  There really isn't anything else you can do here.  I'm sure you're helping where you can, financially.  But you can only do what you can.\n\nI agree with your mom here.  If Sam completely neglected seeing her grandparents, they have every right not to give that person a penny.", "NTA. Sam is facing the consequences of basically cutting her grandmother out of her life, as very few people wants to pay for a strangers education. \n\nYou tried to speak with both Sam and your mother and they both used their free will to do what they wanted.\n\nThere was a college fund, but Sam\u2019s mom used it to buy a house. \n\nI suggest Sam take up her lack of funds with your ex. Get her to pay her back what was in her fund.", "NTA\u2026 your daughter made her bed she can sleep on it", "NTA. Some of these comments are wild though. \n\nGrandma can choose to give her money to, and it\u2019s not your place to tell her what to do with it. Once she can deal with the consequences. Cause even if she does choose to pay for your daughters tuition, more than likely she isn\u2019t going to forget this, and their relationship will forever be strained. \n\nI understand your daughter though. I\u2019m good with both my parents side family, but there\u2019s one side that I\u2019m much closer to. Still love the other side, but it just happens. \n\nYour ex wife is the real AH.

Your daughter was warned by her Grandmother, she ignored those warnings.  You spoke to your Mum about it, you actually had college funds but your ex spent that money on a bigger house for her extended family, even though she had one large enough for her immediate family.  Since the divorce you have saved what you could, which is reasonable.  There is nothing more you can do, your daughter is unfortunately facing the consequences of her actions, you don't get to pretty much ignore someone and then expect them to fork out the amount of money needed for a college education.  It's on your wife who spent the original college money on something that wasn't needed to work out.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your daughter was warned about the possible consequences and now she's living those consequences.

You shouldn't try to replace all of the monetary support your daughter lost.", "NAH. \n\nAs you said, this was your mothers decision, not yours, and a result of how Sam has prioritized visits.\n\nEdit: Meant to say NAH not N.T.A. cuz I don\u2019t really think your daughters choices make her the asshole but these are the consequences and that\u2019s life.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nDaughter can't expect tens of thousands of dollars from someone she neglects.  Grandma has no obligation to pay either.  You did what you could, I doubt forcing your daughter to hang out with grandma would've improved their relationship much. It sucks but she'll have to live with the consequences and hope the other half of the family can help her out.", "NTA. The court ordered that your kids' college funds go to your ex, and she spent them on a house rather than saving them for your children's college as they were intended. Your daughter chose to spend holidays and major events with her mother's family and not yours. Your mother chose to rescind her offer of paying for college since your daughter chose to spend so little time/ have so little contact with her. While you could have force your daughter to see your family, you didn't, giving your daughter the ability to make her own decisions. She now doesn't like the result of her decision, and blames you and her grandmother, when really she should be blaming herself and her own mother for not having college funds.", "So Sam got her college fund, and spent it on a house. It\u2019s quite cruel to expect an elderly grandmother to pay her expenses whilst not even giving her the time of day.\n\nNTA", "Info: Were the strings attached to the financial support made clear to Sam?", "NTA. Your mother isn't The Bank of Grandma. If your daughter really alienated your parents that much in favor of your ex-in laws, I don't see how either of you are TA, to be honest.", "NTA. Only AH is her mother for taking that money and spending it elsewhere. If she wants her tuition paid for, OP is well within their rights to point her in that direction.

Sam is in the midst of a great big FAFO of her own making.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your daughter made her bed now she can lie on it. I\u2019m this is what happens. When we push family away, our actions have consequences.  The good thing is you will still help her. The bad thing it will not be the one she chose. I bet she\u2019s also cut out of the inheritance. Again, Sam was a jerk to your mother. She knows what she\u2019s doing by choosing sides rather than stay neutral and visit everyone equally.  Also, setting an appointment with grandma and then disappearing really hurts. Her actions told her grandmother she didn\u2019t care. \nRemember she neglected your grandmother.

Here's another example of why \"college money\" should be put into a specific financial product designed for education expenses: to prevent issues like 1) Mom using the cash to buy a house; and 2) Grandma deciding not to pay out at all, on a whim.\n\nSo yeah, if you weren't going to save yourself for your kid's college, then the \"getting more involved\" on your part should have been opening a 529 fund (or whatever similar college-fund financial product) when your mother first offered.

Your daughter is being punished for decisions she made as a minor that should have been managed by you. If you wanted your daughter to have a flourishing relationship with her grandmother while still a minor, you needed to insist on regular visits to facilitate that.\n\nHowever, given that your mother would be so vindictive as to revoke a promise  made to a child right before she is preparing to attend college, perhaps there is more to why she didn't want to see the grandmother in the first place.", "Grandma is TA.

If your side of the family is so big on consequences than what\u2019s going to be your mothers for lying to your daughter about paying for school(she gave no stipulations so your daughter deserves what was promised to her) and breaking a promise. It\u2019s nothing wrong with allowing consequences to take place but in this situation your mother should be learning that as well. I\u2019d never allow anyone to treat my kids differently and cause discourse between me and them. Do you think that that\u2019s apart of why she didn\u2019t want to come around. It\u2019s okay if you want to teach cause and effect but you need to stand on that fully and that would also be holding your mother accountable for not being a woman of her word.", "Grandma is TA here. Is it any wonder your daughter doesn't want to spend time with her? She has made their relationship transactional. Has she invited Sam over when it is not a holiday?

You should have gotten involved when your 10 year old stopped spending time with your side of the family, not left that choice to a child. Ever hear of custody orders that divide the child\u2019s time between parents? Did you enforce the custody order so that when it was your time, Sam was with you? Did you take your child to see her grandparents when you had custody? What did you do to foster a relationship between your young child & her grandparents?

By turning all of your kid\u2019s college fund over to someone else & doing nothing when that person spent the money on something else?

She should remortgage to pay it back.", "It's a 529 plan, not 579. And people can still steal a kid's college fund if they have no scruples. It happened to my son. His father was supposed to continue paying for our son's prepaid college plan. Right before our son's senior year in high school, I inquired about the plan to try to plan for other expenses that it wouldn't cover. I discovered that he had cancelled the plan 7 years earlier and received a refund. \n\nI had to get a lawyer to enforce our court order and he ended up having to put enough money into a 529 to cover what the prepaid plan would have plus pay my legal fees. But it took close to a year to resolve and became very nasty, which he took out on our son. It was ugly. \n\nThen 6 years later, when our son went to file his taxes for his first real job, his refund was taken by the IRS and he was told he owed close to $50k in back taxes and penalties - from his father taking the prepaid plan refund since our son's social security number was on the plan. So, I guess I'm saying that even a 529 plan doesn't necessarily protect the child if the other parent is a thief.

But if grandma doesn\u2019t want to play walking wallet to an absent granddaughter, there\u2019s also nothing anyone can say or do to change her mind.

He can inform, recommend, express his thoughts, express his feelings about her behavior, but he can\u2019t force her to listen. \n\nTrying to force her could have caused her to go no contact with him.

She fucking ghosted her grandmother, sorry OP, your daughter has been disrespectful.\n\nAlso, it is laughable seeing the people who assumed OP was white because the daughter liked her maternal families food more than the paternal.\nIf you missed it, the thieving ex is white and the OP is Hispanic.

Another crappy thing is that OP and his family will take all the blame since daughter seems to prioritize her mom - I doubt she\u2019ll even fully understand that her mom kind of screwed her in the end. \n\nMy BIL\u2019s daughter kind of did this to my in-laws and only comes around for money. Eventually they stopped giving her anything and she stopped coming around at all. It was pretty sad for my MIL, now they just send gifts for her kids they\u2019ve only see every once in a great while.", "OP said in a comment that she didn't have any issue with Grandma, it's just that the food was better at her mom's side of the family's events and there were more people there. She chose fun and food in the present rather than heeding her father and grandmother's warnings that she was alienating the person willing to most support her financially.\n\nIt would have possibly been difficult for OP to force her to go visit his mother due to the daughter's age unfortunately. I know that anytime my brother-in-law tried to set reasonable rules for my niece, she would go to her mother's and word would get back to him that she was considering going to a judge to say she wanted to stop her required visitations with him.

If Dad tried to make her visit his family, she could have done this (not saying she did, but it's definitely not cut and dry that he could just make her visit Grandma with no repercussions if mom didn't encourage it as well).

That's an asshole move on your mother's part. \n3. How much per year are we talking? I'm assuming b/c you seem to be financially secure, she likely didn't qualify for any financial aid... what's the yearly tuition? And what's the dream program--are we talking \"I want to major in creative writing\" or \"I'm going to be an engineer\"... b/c those things factor into how advisable it is to take on large amounts of debt (though really it's NEVER advisable, but I digress)\n\nAll this is to say, I want to pass on some advice that might help you be a good parent to your daughter as you try to help triage this--b/c I'd also say you'd be the asshole if you're not there to support her and offer some solutions in the face of what is devastating for her (regardless of whether she brought this upon herself).\n\nIf she's looking at 6 figures of college debt, she needs to first a) appeal to the financial aid department of the college and see if they'll reevaluate her aid offer but as that likely won't help if you make a lot of money b) take a gap year. If she did ED for a school, this means withdrawing her acceptance--it's not easy to do, but she'll have to claim financial hardship with the school (but they may push back on family assets btw).  You're really not supposed to back out of ED, but oh well. If this is an EA or RD situation and she's not committed to the school yet, great. She'll need to decline. It's going to hurt her soul. But...\n\nShe'll need to take a gap year and basically start all over again with college admissions with an entirely new strategy. That new strategy is based on \"I cannot afford to pay for college but my parents make too much to get financial aid\"--she needs to start over with a new, realistic budget (ie: how much, if anything can you contribute, etc.) and evaluate her strengths and apply with merit aid in mind. There will be opportunities for her being biracial with Hispanic heritage; she's considered an under represented minority in college admissions and should be able to use that to her advantage strategically. If she's a half decent student, there is no reason she wouldn't be an attractive candidate at many schools. It's critical to apply early to schools who give merit aid--the whole reason she's screwed now is all the money is gone, so even if she appeals to the school, if they didn't offer her any, they won't magically be able to give her a full ride.\n\nFrankly, I'd encourage her to do some real soul searching about this entire situation and if she can gain some clarity/growth this would make a stunning college admissions essay. But only if she has actual maturity and growth about it. During her gap year, I'd encourage her to get a job or do something similarly productive so she's not just taking a vacation for the year. Maybe she'll manage to mend her relationship with her grandmother. I wish her the best as this whole situation sucks. This will be a learning experience for sure.\n\nSo yeah: she needs a new plan.

So if OP got 50% of the assets to use (for example a house and a small account) and ex got 50% (both college accounts and the car) this would mean that ex was expected to use the share of assets she got in the divorce to wholly fund the education.  College funding should have been worked out again after divorce with both parents contributing.", "Overall I very much agree. The one part I'm struggling with is that Grandma decided to announce shortly after a lot of college deadlines had passed.\n\nThis doesn't reflect on OP, but if Grandma wants to rescind her promise of support, she should at least have shared this information early enough that decisions about what schools to apply to could be made with the correct financial information in mind. There might be other choices of what school to apply to that daughter could have made if she were aware that college is not going to be covered that are now closed to her due to deadlines.\n\nMaybe it was just that the reality of hearing about the admissions decision is what made Grandma realize that she can't bring herself to pay for this, but... Basically, I support Grandma's right to respond to the fact that she isn't being treated like family, but the way it was carried out leaves a lot to be desired.", "This is the only comment you need to read OOP. \n\nU/mindovermuses really organized your situation paragraph by paragraph.

It was almost like he was accusing me of something. I told him I had no idea and offered to help him pay for a lawyer to help get it straightened out. He must have asked his father after that and somehow worked it out with a lawyer. It was a few years after that when he told me what the cause of the refund being held was.

OP said that he's an only child, so there aren't any cousins or large extended family for their get-togethers. Daughter seems to have taken her paternal grandmother for granted, even when her brother did not, and is now paying the price for not taking the warnings that grandma would soon no longer consider her family seriously.\n\nI mean, imagine it from grandma's POV. Her only child gives her two grandchildren that she already rarely gets to see because of the divorce. She loves them enough to want to provide a college fund in addition to the one their parents had set up for them. She then watches as her former daughter-in-law plunder that college savings on an unnecessary new house. To make matters worse, she has to repeatedly hear from her granddaughter (indirectly) that she isn't fun or good enough to spend time with. Then, when she finally gets the granddaughter to agree to go get their nails done together, she gets herself ready and drives out to pick her up and granddaughter isn't there and never told her she had changed her mind about the outing. This entire time, her grandson has visited her regularly and not taken her for granted, so it's hard not to take this personally. She gives granddaughter a warning that she's tired of being mistreated and will soon no longer think of her as family- which should have been a big warning flag that the college fund she had set aside for her grandchildren would go away for her- and granddaughter blows it off and continues the way she's been acting. Now that she's realized her mother stole one of her college funds and that she ruined her relationship with her grandmother, the daughter is upset that she can't afford her dream school and might have to take out loans- like a good portion of the population has to in order to attend college in the US.", "sam brought this upon herself. OP and his mother are not in the wrong here, at all. if sam wants to go no contact that\u2019s her issue, and she should always remember that she caused this. thinking your grandma is a bank is incredibly entitled and selfish, not to mention absolving your own mother of blame when she used your college money to fund a house for her new family. sam is 17 not 10, she knows that actions have consequences.\n\nyou\u2019re acting like OP and his mother should live in guilt for their near-adult daughter\u2019s own life choices. sam and her mother should be the ones feeling guilty. she has ruined this relationship so badly that even if she tried to make amends her grandma will feel like it\u2019s all to get the money back.", "What always befuddles me is that basic sympathy is a thing. I spent loads of time with my grandparents as a teen, not because I was obligated to, but because I cared for them. From OP's account, Sam just decided to ignore his mom after the divorce. You don't need to be an adult to know that that is unfair. Why should grandma care for Sam when Sam clearly doesn't care in return? And if we argue that Sam didn't spend time with grandma just because she wasn't fond of her, that's perfectly fine. But then Sam shouldn't expect a penny from her either.", "Have you ever asked why your daughter doesn't like going to her grandma? I think a hint could be taken from that comment \"she liked having another woman in the family\". Maybe grandma expected your daughter to be certain way and she didn't like it?\n\nHow much more frequently your son visited grandma compared to your daughter?\n\nAlso you act like this doesn't affect you. But it does, your mother said she was taking care of that huge expense. From then on you and your wife stopped thinking you would have to do it. That is why you were not so worried about getting her money. That is why you didn't care your ex used that money to something else. And now she springs this on you.\n\nMy grandma hated my guts, and she was nice to my sibling, given them money, etc. My grandma always made awful comments about my mom. I always hated that, and I never let it pass. She either did that less in front of my sibling or they didn't care, but in any case we never got along. Of course I never expected to receive anything from her. However I can see how a dumb 16th year old could fail to do the math if grandma promised the money. Also my grandma was quite misogynistic, so I can imagine how a grandma could treat a grandson in quite a better way than a granddaughter.\n\nI think you need to understand what is really the reason why your daughter has become stranged from your mother. Normally children love grandparents that are nice to them. Of course teens are known to be idiots sometimes so we can not discard that option.\n\nIn any case this is your daughter. She is 17, she made those \"decisions\" when she was what? 15? She is underage. It is your job to help her. So help her. It doesn't mean you have to force your mom to pay anything. Your mom has her own will. Help your daughter to deal with the issues. How to make a plan to get to the school she wants. Even getting loans If you saved money like you said, it should be possible. This is not her thing to deal alone with. If you guys had college funds and your ex used them for something else, she also needs to help your daughter. Help your daughter, she is scared and she doesn't know how to deal with this situation. A parent job is to help their children navigate this kind of situation. If you have no idea you can also search for information. There are also many kind of scholarships. Work with her.\n\nIn any case, as an adult if I promised my grandchild money for college, even If they were jerks I wouldn't pull the money all of the sudden. I just couldn't imagine doing that to a stupid teen. I couldn't live with my conscience. Your daughter does visit them, just not as frequently as she wants. Has your daughter said to your mother face that she feels they are less than the other part of her family? I mean sometimes you get along better with certain people, ir doesn't mean they think you are less than.\n\nDo you know if racism could be the reason? I am not saying your grandma. But anyone of the people involved.\n\nYou are her father, you have to help her. You can't help what your mother did, she has her own will. But you can help what you do. Your daughter did something likely stupid from the information you provided. As a parent you have to help her deal with this situation. That doesn't mean forcing your mom help, it just means helping her search for alternatives, etc. Also means trying to understand why this happen. Maybe you should be upset. You don't seem to really know why your daughter doesn't like your mom, maybe there is a valid reason. If there is no valid reason, well you just tell her people have feelings and we don't get to use them as things.\n\nBasically you have to help your daughter. If you don't you will be an ah.

There is no Brady Bunch lesson learned in the dying moments of an episode here.  \n\nSure yeah, OP and his mother can treat this as a lesson they're teaching a kid.  It'll be the last one - OP's mother is unlikely to have a relationship with Sam after this, and OP stands a very high chance of losing Sam as well.

You think you're teaching them a lesson, they're learning who they want to consider family.\n\nYou can't treat your kids like they're forever 5 and everything can eventually be sorted out after the crying is done.  Sam's 17 years old and she's been now given the reason for never talking, spending time with or interacting with her father's side of the family ever again.  Even if OP's mother walks that back, damage has already been done - Sam's going to assume anything from that side of the family comes with strings attached and performative requirements.   \n\nOP and his mother aren't the assholes but they've fucked up their relationship with Sam.  And it's just --- what's more important to you, as a parent.  Being right or your kid's trust? Like --- in effect, imagine having your kid just not trusting or relying on you, as a parent, because they think that at any moment you could not just abandon them but seriously damage their future because you don't like how they're acting.\n\nYou got kids? You imagine that then - that they're sitting there, thinking that they're going to have to drop out of school and get a job to pay for food and a roof over their head cause you calculated that they didn't eat enough meals with you and so they aren't worth paying for anymore.  Now you imagine how you'd sort that out with your kids.  How you'd go from that situation back to where they didn't think their entire future depended on performing for parental support.\n\nAnyway, good luck to OP.

The answer to this question might indicate how much she understands her actions and the consequences.", "Esh\nI am happy I talk to all my relatives and my kids have a good relation to them all.\nBut I wouldn't destroy my kids future if I could avoid it.", "YTA\n\nIf you think a 17 yo is fully developed to make legit decisions, you don't know anything about child development. Also, you're divorced. It sounds like your daughter lives w you. When should she see her mom's family? Did your mother communicate the need to spend time with her to earn the college money? Stop blaming your shitty behaviour on your culture. My dad isn't from the US, and he treats me better than my American mother. You say she's not a child, but no one has treated her like an adult (or acted like one). You can't expect her to be mature when you're acting like a petulant child yourself because you don't like what we're saying. Your mother is being the same way. Crying about not getting attention from her grandchild like a toddler. Family is important, but consider that your child would spend time with y'all if you were positive people to be around. This is a major thing that takes away from her future. Your mother doesn't love your daughter. She wants to own your daughter. I guarantee she would have spent time with the grandmother had she known losing her future was on the table, but imagine adults communicating \ud83d\ude44\n\nETA: my decision is based on the *attitude* of the father. While I think the daughter made mistakes, she isn't fully an adult and is at a time in her life where she's testing independence. I also have yet to see a comment saying if she knows what her mother did with her college fund. I can't imagine wanting to spend time with the mom's family if she knew. Tbh a lot of (grand)parents feel entitled to their kids lives for doing the basics, so that's why I'm more inclined to think the kid is in the right. Your parents raise you, and you raise your kids. Isn't their behaviour ultimately your own problem? Maybe blaming things on culture rather than growing (like healthy cultures do) is the problem here", "ESH- does the punishment really fit the crime here? Should gifts be conditional and come with strings attached? I feel like there is a LOT more going on here than we can understand. Dealing with divorce as a teenager is fucking hard and the adults are expecting a lot out of a kid whose brain isn\u2019t fully formed yet. She likely feels torn between two families and feels some type of way about that. I think I only she can speak her truth here, your perspective of the situation is not the same as hers. Surface level, she sucks for not spending time with grandma regardless of the monetary gift that was promised. But I want to know her real why because I have a feeling \u201cthe food is better\u201d isn\u2019t really it. Grandma should have more understanding and empathy towards granddaughter. Long term, screwing over someone\u2019s future because they didn\u2019t go with you to get your nails done is shitty. Just really think about what this means for her going forward\u2026this is completely changing her path for her future and does she really deserve that? Is there a reason she can\u2019t have a second chance?", "NTA to the dad and grandma, TA to mom though for sure. \n\nIf what he says is correct, Sam didn\u2019t make much of an effort to continue connecting with grandma. I\u2019m not sure why so many people think there are no strings attached to this money? Of course there were! If you basically ignore your grandma for a few years, yeah she\u2019s not going to want to drop thousands of dollars on you. Also, many people are saying several years ago was a full seven so she was only 10, and that\u2019s just not how the word works. It\u2019s more likely she was between the ages of 12-14 when parents divorced. And dad said for a little bit she did speak with grandma regularly like she used to, but it slowly decreased to the point where she straight up ditched grandma on an agreed outing. That\u2019s just rude and even a 16 year old would know that. Plus, she was warned that if she didn\u2019t go see grandma/respect her then grandma would treat her the same? I think it\u2019s pretty clear. I understand she was young and her family went through a divorce, and she totally had the right to pick a side. But she can\u2019t be surprised when the other side stops caring and doesn\u2019t feel the need to be so generous. \n\nIf mom actually spent the money that was meant for college on a house, that\u2019s pretty messed up. Maybe it wasn\u2019t explicitly written out to be for college but both parents and the judge were operating with the understanding that that was what it was intended for.", "My parents divorced when I was 3 and have hated each other ever since.  They treat time with me as a competition, and will get very upset with me if I\u2019m not splitting my time with them exactly equally.  I\u2019m 42 freaking years old and this is like a high wire act I constantly have to manage and balance, otherwise someone\u2019s feelings are hurt.

You respected her autonomy of where to spend holidays and didn\u2019t try to keep her from her mother\u2019s family.

Maybe this is your ex-wife's influence. Who knows. \n\nIf your ex-wife got your children's college accounts, and used the money in those accounts to pay for a house, instead of for their intended use of paying for her children's college education, then I think that she is the true AH of this piece.", "NTA.

I'm sure she wanted to be with her mother more and I get that if my parents have ever divorced I guarantee I would have spent more time with my mother then my father. I mean it's kind of sucks that your mother is putting strings on her promise now. I think that is a bit spiteful. But obviously it's her prerogative, it's her money. Just like it's her prerogative to leave all her money to her best friend or her dog if she chose to. Having sitting down with both of them is probably a good idea. Maybe your mother will relent some and support her for half of it. I think that would be a reasonable compromise your daughter learns that she has to be responsible and get loans for the other half. Say Your mother pays for the first two years and then your daughter has to finish up or your mom pays for tuition only and your daughter figures out about living expenses and whether it be a dorm or an apartment.\n\nIs your daughter even mad at her mother for blowing her college fund in order to buy a house? Why didn't your wife try and resave the money at least? I mean that's kind of a crappy thing to do.", "NTA but both mothers are.

The same goes for, don't ignore the person paying your bills and think they will keep doing so happily.\n\nPushing your mother to continue to finance your daughter will simply continue to widen a rift between you and your mother. I would give it time. It's one of those situations. Is your daughter even aware that her college fund was used towards financing her mother's house? Maybe bring that up, not to bash the mother or anything but that the priority she gives to one over the other doesn't give back the same support for her future.\n\nYour daughter is the one who needs to make amends, and she needs to find a way to do that without looking like she's only doing it for the cash grab.\n\nGood luck!!", "The mean people make comments based on their choices and experiences.

Sure, she isn't obligated to pay, but she made a promise to your daughter long ago with no conditions set with it. \n\nHow is your daughter to assume this would happen if she felt her grandmother's love and affection was conditional, and therfore her college find was as well? \n\nI think you need to mediate with both of them in the same room. Together.  If grandma's issues is not seeing her, then there needs to be planned time to do so.  Am is ultimately 17. She under the law IS a child.

Maybe OP can encourage Sam & Gma to talk it out", "I\u2019m curious how or if the girls mother plans to help now that she has spent the original college fund and probably encouraged the daughter to spend more time with her vs opportunities to spend holidays with the grandmother.", "I think there may be a lot missing here. If it's true your ex spent money that was intended to go towards her college funds, then your ex sounds like a narcissistic piece of work. If that's who your daughter was spending more time with, it's not unlikely that that has impacted her decisions, especially if she's forgiven her mother for doing so. \n\nTeenagers don't want to spend time with their family, particularly the side they are not as close to. Is it an asshole thing to do? Sure, but that's their age group. I loved my grandparents, but did I want to spend my time with them when I was a teenager? Heck no! However, they knew it was my age and I wanted to spend time with my friends. Then I grew up, matured, and developed a more one-on-one relationship with them in which I valued their time. \n\nIt's weird to punish a teenager for doing normal teenage things. Your mother is an adult. If she's promised her this for years, it's a total asshole power move to revoke it after she's already applied for and secured a college. Don't promise to secure a kid's future and then get upset when they act like a kid (and yes, I know you think that's okay because 18 year olds can fight wars, but should they? Absolutely not). She can pull the funds that she promised her, but it's going to completely sever her relationship now and in the future. Like, if it was a promised trip to Disney Land, I'd understand pulling that. But college funds? That's 100 percent going to impact her entire future. \n\nI feel like we'd be getting a completely different view of the situation from your daughter. There's definitely something missing.", "OP you are NTA now.

Your daughter planned her future based on a promise, and the promise was withheld at the last possible moment. You admitted now she needs to plan again, change majors etc. \nSam also made it clear why she prefers other side of the family. What your mother did to changed her way?

All of you are at fault OP. But maybe instead of putting all the blame on a teenager you start think and find a blame on your mother also. \nI get you are from a different culture then USA.

It is very manipulative of your mom to use the money as leverage, instead of investigating why your daughter didn\u2019t feel the need to prioritize her relationship with your parents. At 17, you\u2019re not a child, yes, but you\u2019re also not an adult. Learning consequences is very important, but I wonder how your mother has acted towards Sam all her life and if there isn\u2019t more to the story than what you\u2019ve said.

Unless she is a completely shallow asshole there may have been more to it than she was letting on, than just simply the food was better. No one can really know what she is feeling on the inside except her. Or maybe it really is about the food, and she's just been an asshole lol. It also is probably not going to help salve things between the two of them now that she withdrew her financial support out of pettiness or feeling left out. But that's a different issue.
