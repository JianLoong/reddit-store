{"id": 11094, "submission_id": "11ds21u", "title": "AITA for not getting more involved in my daughters college fund situation?", "selftext": "   \n\nI have two children, a daughter Sam (17f), and a son(19m), and I have always made sure that their education is a top priority. My son is already off at school and doing very well, and Sam was accepted into her desired college school and program, my mom promised to pay for her entire education along time ago, including tuition and accommodation. Everyone was overjoyed with this. \n\nHowever, after my divorce several years ago, Sam started to prioritize my ex-wife\u2019s family during every season, Sam decided to visit her mom's side of the family instead of spending time with mine. We always told there\u2019s a lot more people there and the food is so much better. Can\u2019t argue with the fact that her extended family was there, but I don\u2019t think an hour with grandparents is asking too much. This all upset my mother and strained their relationship. Two weeks ago, she called me to tell me that she would no longer be paying for Sam\u2019s education. She felt that Sam had put her own family second and didn\u2019t treat her like she mattered at all. I hate to say it, but I also can\u2019t argue with that. \n\nSince then, Sam has taken full view of what college is going to look like for her. She will likely need to rethink her dream school and major. On top of that the loans will be an anchor in her life. She asked me to help, and I certainly will when I can, but when her mother and I divorced, she got all the college accounts and used that to fund her house. This is old news, but I feel very relevant. \n\nWhile I feel bad for my daughter, I do not feel responsible for my mother's actions. She made the choice to stop supporting Sam\u2019s education, and I cannot force her to change her mind. I have spoken to my mother and tried to reason with her, but she is firm in her decision. I have also told Sam that she brought this on herself for treating her grandmother less than the rest of her family. \n\nSam is understandably upset and feels like she is being punished for wanting to spend time with her mom's side of the family. However, I believe that she is old enough to understand the consequences of her actions and make decisions for herself. As a parent, I have always taught my children to take responsibility for their choices, and I feel that this situation is no different.\n\nSo, Reddit, Am I The Asshole here?

There was a college fund in place for her that your ex-wife misused through no fault of your own as giving it over to her was court-ordered. Your daughter was given warning that her grandmother was upset and was going to stop considering her family after repeatedly choosing your ex's family over yours and even going so far as to let your ailing mother show up to pick her up for an agreed upon outing, to her not being home and not going.\n\nYour son has continued to spend time with grandma and doesn't imply that your family is too boring to visit like your daughter has, so he has earned the privilege of your mother's gift. He put in the work to maintain the relationship and is being rewarded for it. She didn't.\n\nYour daughter is learning a very expensive lesson early in life that you can't take people for granted and still feel entitled to support from them. Even if she starts visiting Grandma daily from now until graduation, your mother will know that she's only using her for the money now, so it won't mean as much. Your daughter has burned a bridge because she wasn't willing to sacrifice a few hours here and there to stay close with one of the few family members who was actually willing to pay a life-changing amount of money towards her future.\n\nIt sounds like you tried to warn her multiple times while still giving her space to make decisions for herself as she's been inching closer to adulthood... and she decided to ignore you and is now paying the price. She wanted to be treated like an adult to make her own decisions on who she visited but now doesn't want to deal with the adult responsibilities for those choices. At this point she needs to be asking her mother about the college fund she got in the divorce and how she plans to make up for it being gone now.", "NTA.  Your ex needs to refund her college account.  I don\u2019t understand why no one has issues with the fact she misappropriated her college find so extended family could have a free house.", "NTA. You tried to talk to your mom on her behalf and that didn't work. And her mom used her college money to buy a house. A lesson to others  - put the money in a 579 fund so that it cannot be taken out by the parents for their own use. A lesson for your daughter, she is not entitled to any money from grandma if she ghosts her and spends all her time with the otther side of the family. My kids were written out of my mother's will because they never visited her.", "NTA\n\nThe only person who should be equally responsible for Sam's college education finance is her mother.  Particularly because she used that fund to buy her house.  That completely makes her mom the AH here.\n\nWhile it was great that your mom offered to pay for Sam's college, that is 100% your mom's decision, not yours.\n\nYou tried to reason with your mom to no avail.  There really isn't anything else you can do here.  I'm sure you're helping where you can, financially.  But you can only do what you can.\n\nI agree with your mom here.  If Sam completely neglected seeing her grandparents, they have every right not to give that person a penny.", "NTA. Sam is facing the consequences of basically cutting her grandmother out of her life, as very few people wants to pay for a strangers education. \n\nYou tried to speak with both Sam and your mother and they both used their free will to do what they wanted.\n\nThere was a college fund, but Sam\u2019s mom used it to buy a house. \n\nI suggest Sam take up her lack of funds with your ex. Get her to pay her back what was in her fund.", "NTA\u2026 your daughter made her bed she can sleep on it", "NTA. Some of these comments are wild though. \n\nGrandma can choose to give her money to, and it\u2019s not your place to tell her what to do with it. Once she can deal with the consequences. Cause even if she does choose to pay for your daughters tuition, more than likely she isn\u2019t going to forget this, and their relationship will forever be strained. \n\nI understand your daughter though. I\u2019m good with both my parents side family, but there\u2019s one side that I\u2019m much closer to. Still love the other side, but it just happens. \n\nYour ex wife is the real AH. To spent the kids money on her own selfish needs and then make you all the bad guys. It\u2019s kinda sad that your kids don\u2019t see this and will only see grandma as the bad one.", "NTA\n\nWhere is son getting his college money, if your ex got both college funds and used it to fund her house?\n\nTell Sam to ask her mother for her college money.   \n\nYour mother has a right to keep her money if Sam isn't interested in a relationship.     What did Sam think was going to happen if she ignored Grandma?", "NTA.  Sam should ask her maternal relatives for help to fund her education.", "with the info here I'd say NAH but it feels like something more is going on between Sam your side of the family that is not being included", "NTA- She hasn't learned the rule yet. The Golden Rule. \n\nThose who have the gold make the rules.", "Info: Why cant the mums side of the family pay?", "NTA. Why would she expect to get money from someone she made clear doesn\u2019t matter to her?!", "NTA. This is between your daughter and her grandparents. She is making adult level decisions that come with consequences.", "Nah I don't understand why Sam would want to spend time with the person who stole her college fund though ...does she know", "NTA.  Your daughter was warned by her Grandmother, she ignored those warnings.  You spoke to your Mum about it, you actually had college funds but your ex spent that money on a bigger house for her extended family, even though she had one large enough for her immediate family.  Since the divorce you have saved what you could, which is reasonable.  There is nothing more you can do, your daughter is unfortunately facing the consequences of her actions, you don't get to pretty much ignore someone and then expect them to fork out the amount of money needed for a college education.  It's on your wife who spent the original college money on something that wasn't needed to work out.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your daughter was warned about the possible consequences and now she's living those consequences.  Lesson learned, don't treat people like garbage if you want their support", "NTA\n\nSam should be talking to her Mom and Grandma.  You shouldn't try to replace all of the monetary support your daughter lost.", "NAH. \n\nAs you said, this was your mothers decision, not yours, and a result of how Sam has prioritized visits.\n\nEdit: Meant to say NAH not N.T.A. cuz I don\u2019t really think your daughters choices make her the asshole but these are the consequences and that\u2019s life.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nDaughter can't expect tens of thousands of dollars from someone she neglects.  Grandma has no obligation to pay either.  You did what you could, I doubt forcing your daughter to hang out with grandma would've improved their relationship much. It sucks but she'll have to live with the consequences and hope the other half of the family can help her out.", "NTA. The court ordered that your kids' college funds go to your ex, and she spent them on a house rather than saving them for your children's college as they were intended. Your daughter chose to spend holidays and major events with her mother's family and not yours. Your mother chose to rescind her offer of paying for college since your daughter chose to spend so little time/ have so little contact with her. While you could have force your daughter to see your family, you didn't, giving your daughter the ability to make her own decisions. She now doesn't like the result of her decision, and blames you and her grandmother, when really she should be blaming herself and her own mother for not having college funds.", "So Sam got her college fund, and spent it on a house. It\u2019s quite cruel to expect an elderly grandmother to pay her expenses whilst not even giving her the time of day.\n\nNTA", "Info: Were the strings attached to the financial support made clear to Sam?", "NTA. Your mother isn't The Bank of Grandma. If your daughter really alienated your parents that much in favor of your ex-in laws, I don't see how either of you are TA, to be honest.", "NTA. Only AH is her mother for taking that money and spending it elsewhere. If she wants her tuition paid for, OP is well within their rights to point her in that direction. OP has already fulfilled their duty by saving up that money before, and Grandma has absolutely no obligation to pay, especially given the way OP's daughter treats her.", "NTA. Sam is in the midst of a great big FAFO of her own making.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your daughter made her bed now she can lie on it. I\u2019m this is what happens. When we push family away, our actions have consequences.  The good thing is you will still help her. The bad thing it will not be the one she chose. I bet she\u2019s also cut out of the inheritance. Again, Sam was a jerk to your mother. She knows what she\u2019s doing by choosing sides rather than stay neutral and visit everyone equally.  Also, setting an appointment with grandma and then disappearing really hurts. Her actions told her grandmother she didn\u2019t care. \nRemember she neglected your grandmother. When we neglect a person we tell them they don\u2019t exist. So sad.", "ESH. Here's another example of why \"college money\" should be put into a specific financial product designed for education expenses: to prevent issues like 1) Mom using the cash to buy a house; and 2) Grandma deciding not to pay out at all, on a whim.\n\nSo yeah, the \"getting more involved\" on your part should have been opening a 529 fund (or whatever similar college-fund financial product) when your mother first offered. It would have been in your name designated for your daughter, with your mother's money.", "> Should have I gotten more involved?\n\nHow could you had gotten more involved?", "ESH yes you should have been more vocal in getting your daughter to spend time with family and saving after the divorce. However the fact that her mother spent her college saving needs to be looked into. Was this part of the divorce & custody agreement for her to maintain this account for your daughter? I\u2019d be speaking with your lawyer on your daughter behalf.", "NAH except maybe Grandma.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's a hell of a thing to take away with no warning.", "YTA. Your daughter is being punished for decisions she made as a minor that should have been managed by you. If you wanted your daughter to have a flourishing relationship with her grandmother while still a minor, you needed to insist on regular visits to facilitate that.\n\nHowever, given that your mother would be so vindictive as to revoke a promise  made to a child right before she is preparing to attend college, perhaps there is more to why she didn't want to see the grandmother in the first place.", "Grandma is TA. She shouldn't have said she was paying for the college without clearly stating her requirements. If her requirements was to have weekly dinner then she should have told grandkid.", "So Grandma is going to let her granddaughter start her adult life with a debt anchor around her neck because for a couple of years she didn\u2019t make her feel important enough? Parents and grandparents are supposed to love their kids and grandkids unconditionally. That responsibility is not on the kid\u2014it\u2019s on the adult. \n\nSam is a teenager, a kid. Kids aren\u2019t generally known for making great choices. As a teenager, she\u2019s also just starting to understand her own independence. Sure, she could\u2019ve prioritized grandma a little more, but the punishment clearly doesn\u2019t fit the crime here. As a child of divorced parents, she\u2019s also got a lot of adults she feels pressured to please. You can\u2019t hang this all on her. \n\nUltimately, YTA if you\u2019re not on Sam\u2019s side in this. Not in the sense that you say she bears zero responsibility, but in the sense that you\u2019re looking out for her long term future\u2014both for college and her family relationships. \n\nSomebody needs to be the grownup in the room. That\u2019s not the teenager\u2019s job and apparently Grandma can\u2019t or won\u2019t do it\u2014so it\u2019s up to you. I hope you can find a way to help them reconcile so she doesn\u2019t start out life with a debt anchor around her neck and their relationship (and possibly yours) isn\u2019t forever damaged.", "YTA\n\nSo you weren't saving anything since the divorce for her collage, you were entirely relying on your mother? Her mother paid for a house she and the kids lived in and you stopped saving?\n\nI'm just shocked at how cruel and indifferent you are to your daughter having her whole life plan ripped away from her. \n\nAnd your mother, she promised to pay for collage and now just before it's due to start she pulls the offer.\n\nYou say consequences have actions but are you ok with accepting the consequences of your actions?", "YTA and you aren\u2019t teaching your daughter anything but it\u2019s okay to make promises and break them and that relationships are transactional. If your side of the family is so big on consequences than what\u2019s going to be your mothers for lying to your daughter about paying for school(she gave no stipulations so your daughter deserves what was promised to her) and breaking a promise. It\u2019s nothing wrong with allowing consequences to take place but in this situation your mother should be learning that as well. I\u2019d never allow anyone to treat my kids differently and cause discourse between me and them. Do you think that that\u2019s apart of why she didn\u2019t want to come around. It\u2019s okay if you want to teach cause and effect but you need to stand on that fully and that would also be holding your mother accountable for not being a woman of her word.", "Grandma is TA here. Is it any wonder your daughter doesn't want to spend time with her? She has made their relationship transactional. Has she invited Sam over when it is not a holiday? You say an hour is not too much but would that hour take place in the middle of a large family event? Does your mom stop by to just say hi? Invite Sam to lunch?", "YTA. Good job parenting. You should have gotten involved when your 10 year old stopped spending time with your side of the family, not left that choice to a child. Ever hear of custody orders that divide the child\u2019s time between parents? Did you enforce the custody order so that when it was your time, Sam was with you? Did you take your child to see her grandparents when you had custody? What did you do to foster a relationship between your young child & her grandparents? Did you take an hour out of your life to bring Sam to see her grandma? \n\nYou say that you always made sure that \u201ctheir education is a top priority\u201d. How exactly did you do that? By turning all of your kid\u2019s college fund over to someone else & doing nothing when that person spent the money on something else?  You seem to feel that Sam is getting what\u2019s coming to her, but it was your job as a parent to teach her differently, not just throw up your hands & let a teenager make poor decisions.", "YTA and grandma is TA!

There is genuinely nothing in your control here regarding the money and you gave your daughter warnings. You also said you'd help where you can.\n\nIt sucks that she has to learn an adult lesson so early, but she was warned and didn't take heed.

Clearly ex-wife should pay for her college or at least refund what she stole from her", "Agree NTA\n\nThe mother plundered the college account. She should remortgage to pay it back.", "It's a 529 plan, not 579. And people can still steal a kid's college fund if they have no scruples. It happened to my son. His father was supposed to continue paying for our son's prepaid college plan. Right before our son's senior year in high school, I inquired about the plan to try to plan for other expenses that it wouldn't cover. I discovered that he had cancelled the plan 7 years earlier and received a refund. \n\nI had to get a lawyer to enforce our court order and he ended up having to put enough money into a 529 to cover what the prepaid plan would have plus pay my legal fees. But it took close to a year to resolve and became very nasty, which he took out on our son. It was ugly. \n\nThen 6 years later, when our son went to file his taxes for his first real job, his refund was taken by the IRS and he was told he owed close to $50k in back taxes and penalties - from his father taking the prepaid plan refund since our son's social security number was on the plan. So, I guess I'm saying that even a 529 plan doesn't necessarily protect the child if the other parent is a thief. So, yeah, OP should probably help daughter go after mom for the stolen college fund, but he should expect it to get very nasty and there is no guarantee his daughter will actually get the money.", "Even if Sam wanted to spend time with her mother's family,  she could have visited grandma other times and could have called her on a regular basis.

THAT'S the info you need to lead with.   \n\n\nIn this case OP yes you need to intervene. It will cause a fractured relationship with your daughter as she will see it as favoritism to your son.
