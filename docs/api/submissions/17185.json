When it came time for my college graduation, the pandemic just started and no one got a graduation that year. What I really looked forward to was finally walking across a stage in a cap and gown after I completed my masters. My ceremony was Saturday.\nI\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend \u201cJosh\u201d (27M) for close to a year now. Originally, it was planned that he along with my parents would attend the graduation ceremony and we\u2019d go out to eat after.\n\nOn Thursday, Josh\u2019s mom unexpectedly passed away. It truly came out of nowhere and devastated everyone. I\u2019ve been helping Josh and his family the best I can to make preparations. The funeral is Monday.\nI really grappled with whether or not I should attend my graduation, but ultimately decided I should. It\u2019s one day and I figured Josh would be okay without me for a few hours. I obviously didn\u2019t expect him to come anymore, but offered the invitation. He seemed a little stunned but said ultimately he wasn\u2019t going to be able to go and I respected that. My parents seemed a little surprised that I still planned to go, but we went and got dinner afterwards.\n\nWhen I got back to Josh\u2019s that night (he\u2019s been staying at his dad\u2019s), his sister, \u201cAmelia\u201d (30F) went off on me. She asked how I could abandon Josh at this time. Apparently, he ended up having a complete breakdown upon finding some momentous of his mother. Josh hadn\u2019t cried since he got the news but it finally hit him that his mom was gone. He was inconsolable for over an hour. Amelia was the only one there to comfort him. I went to check on him and he didn\u2019t want to see me. I tried to explain to Amelia that this was a once in a lifetime event and that I never had a graduation before. She fired back with \u201cWell, Josh has never had a parent die before\u201d. Ultimately, Amelia and Josh\u2019s dad asked me to leave as I was upsetting both of his children.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to contact Josh since and he\u2019s told me he needs some space. I asked if he still wants me to come to the funeral and he said it\u2019s completely up to me. I brought this up with a friend and she was floored that I had still gone to the ceremony. It seems to be the consensus with everyone that I should\u2019ve skipped it.\n\nWas I wrong?", "created_utc": 1684037996, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h2bco/aita_for_going_to_my_graduation_after_my/", "score": 2495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They can calm the f down\n\nHis is an enormous loss but yours is huge milestone. You've worked very hard and missed out of the ceremony commemorating the previous accomplishments\n\nWould they prefer you do not abandon this guy's side, and mourn with him for years to come??? \n\nTaking some time for yourself, whether it's a few hours or a weekend, it's a healthy thing to do. Your presence isn't going to bring his mum back, you're not going to fill the void she's left behind, so he chose to be selfish and think that you're his and whatever you may have going on in your life is of no value bc it has nothing to do with him\n\n\nHe's lost his mum but he's a selfish f\n\nYou're definitely NTA", "NTA, it's a tragedy his Mother passed away, however your graduation was important to you and your family. His Mother passing away doesn't alleviate him from being a somewhat supportive boyfriend, him not attending makes complete sense but he should have still wanted you to go because it was important to you. He wasn't alone, he was with his family, what would you have been able to offer? Seriously, I'm not trying to belittle your relationship when I say this, but it's been less than a year, how close were you to his mother and the rest of his family?", "NTA - it really sucks but this wasn't something you could just reschedule and it was something that has been planned for a while. It's tragic that his mother passed away but he had his family there with him, and there was no way for you to know that you were going to miss him having a mental breakdown. It's not like you skipped out on the funeral or something. Are you supposed to drop your entire life and just be at his side until he decides otherwise?", "NTA, the world doesn't stop when someone dies. You've been with him and there for him through this and you took a few hours to yourself to celebrate a really important accomplishment, congratulations by the way. Now josh and his family are in a really gnarly hard to cope with time and I'm not saying you should fight them on it but I don't think you did anything wrong. If it was me I'd go to the funeral because that sounds an awful lot like someone who wants you there but is hurt, be a wall flower and offer condolences because you can't undo not going and if you still care about josh it's the right thing to do. Hopefully on the other side of their grief they can come to understand why you went to the graduation.", "NTA. You earned that moment to walk across the stage. You were robbed the first time due to an injury and the second time due to Covid. Do not let anyone make you feel bad for taking a few moments out of the day to celebrate your hard work. \n\nI understand your boyfriend is upset and grieving over the loss of his mother and rightfully so.  It's not like you went and partied afterwards.  How many more opportunities will you get to walk across the stage for your master's? Or how many opportunities do you want to create just to have that day to celebrate?!  \n\nYou came right back but you know what? I think this is best to give Josh all of the space he needs. You will never do anything right in his or his family's eyes right now or ever. I say ever because they will always take the opportunity to throw your graduation day in your face.  Let Josh grieve his mother and you take time to grieve the end of that relationship.", "NTA- it\u2019s not your fault his mother died .\n\nYou deserve to walk at graduation and celebrate your accomplishments.\n\nHis grief isn\u2019t more important than you living your life .\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP.  This is a no win situation with this guy. \n\nGo to the funeral, pay your respects. But don\u2019t be surprised if his family doesn\u2019t want you there as they seem to have jumped onto the idea of making you the scapegoat for their grief.", "NTA\n\nYes, he is in deep grief. But relationships are NOT one sided. He should be able to understand how important this is to you, and even find enough love for you to support your decision. Instead, it's The Josh Show. You also had an important milestone in your life, it was just a happier one. It isn't as though you were skipping the funeral to go to your graduation, you left for a few hours after spending the rest of this time helping the family. I will allow a lot for his grief, but his reaction, and his sisters reaction, and the subsequent cold shoulder, are red flags to me that he's self centered even when not in mourning.", "NTA. It\u2019s graduation. You\u2019ve never experienced it before so of COURSE you deserve to enjoy that one day that for you is quite literally once in a life time (assuming you aren\u2019t doing a PhD). The world keeps going after a death. I also recently has someone die close to me, and while it\u2019s still hard, I\u2019m still living and he sure as hell would want me to keep enjoying life and doing things I like for the sake of living my life. Losing someone is hard, but one of the best ways to grieve and remember them is to keep living.", "You are NTA for attending your graduation (congratulations on your masters).\n\nBut extending the invite for him to still go was tone deaf. I understand why he looked stunned.", "NTA. I think you would have grown to resent Josh if you did not attend your graduation.", "NTA. It sucks, but unavoidable conflicts happen all the time. Taking a few hours to celebrate a massive achievement does not make you callous or a bad girlfriend. His sister is out of line and just using you as an easy target to offload some of her emotion.\n\nYou've been dating less than a year. He was surrounded by people who've known him his whole life. Grief like Josh's is overwhelming no matter who is physically in proximity.", "NTA. You missed both previous graduations and this is a once in a lifetime event. I'm not sure why everyone thinks you should've missed it.\n\nJosh resents you for going but you'd also resent him for pressuring you to miss it and not going.\n\nIt would be one thing if you missed the funeral for your graduation.\n\nI do think you should reflect on this relationship. Is Josh supportive of you generally or is the support all flowing from you to him?", "Darling you have been dubbed NTA in my eyes!", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t miss a memorial or the funeral.  And was gone only a few hours to celebrate something very important to you.  If you had missed the graduation, it would\u2019ve bothered you for the rest of your life.  While your bf will eventually move on and heal.  \n\nAnd you might not even marry the guy.  So you could potentially be sacrificing a ceremony for someone that might not be around in the future.  I really can\u2019t believe you have friends who aren\u2019t on your side.   Considering all the facts.", "Congratulations on your Masters.  NTA, even if you had been to your other graduations, you still had the right to go and get your diploma and hood.  A masters is a great achievement.  Give him time.  You have only been together for a year.  This is a huge test for both of you.  You took a few hours off.  You have been by his side helping with funeral plans you have been his rock.  You took a few ours for yourself.  I would group text the three of them.  Just tell them you understand that they need space and will only attend if they all want you there.  As for the rest of your relationship play it by ear.", "NTA. I could understand if you skipped her funeral or wake or something, but you just left him alone for a few hours. There's no way you should feel bad about this. Congrats on your graduation and I hope things settle down soon everyone.", "NTA \n\nAnd I say this as someone who had my mother die. \nI get every side of this. I was sick at my high school graduation, so I valued my university graduation even more. You did the right thing. You can't be there with him 24/7. He had family there. They are a pile of emotions, but you can't stop your life. They may want everyone to stop, but that is illogical. Give them space. If he reaches out, then go forward. But be firm in the fact you are sorry for his loss, but you can't freeze for him.", "NTA\n\nMy dad died suddenly just after I finished high school (after my graduation). The grief was hard, and I was definitely really angry for a few weeks. But the people around me still had lives to lead. \n\nHe might also resent that you get to go off and have a good moment while he is still deep in grief - I definitely had random moments of strong resentment during my first year of grieving. In retrospect, the other party never did anything wrong. It was just that I was hurting and a special kind of lonely, and then I was angry about feeling that way all the time.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong by going to your graduation (congratulations, by the way!).", "NAH. OP, you deserved to walk at your graduation. Emotions are running extremely high with your boyfriend and his family. Grief makes people react in so many ways. I don't think anyone is in the wrong here.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold!", "NTA \n\nIt was your Masters degree. It was a few hours. You wanted the cap and gown photo after 7 year (or whatever) of study. That was not a replaceable moment. \n\nYou didn\u2019t expect him to come. You took a few hours off. If you had taken a few hours off to go home and shower and change and this had been his breakdown time would the sister have yelled?\n\nLife doesn\u2019t stop because someone died. Sadly. Sometimes we have to do things for kids, friends or other family members while grieving for the loss of someone else. \n\nYou didn\u2019t party or celebrate or go out moshing for 3 days. You took a couple of hours to walk across a stage after studying for sooooo many years. \n\nCongrats on your Masters", "NTA - my mother passed away exactly 1 year ago today. It was very unexpected. I know how much it hurts.  I didn't expect my husband to be with me every second.  Heck he even went to work. I had my dad and sister.  But if anyone had a graduation or other pre planned event,  I would have told them to go.  It was only a few hours.  It wasn't like you missed her funeral.  My dad and sister were great comforters for me as they were going through the same thing.  It is a lot different for you as she was not your mom.  It sounds to me as he and his sister are a little selfish.", "So, on Thursday your partner\u2019s mother dies and on Saturday you are at a celebratory event. I don\u2019t think you will have a partner moving forward. I mean, I don\u2019t know if it makes you TA but I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t want you as my partner.", "I'm sorry I'm gonna go with YTA.\nYou did abandon him in his worst time. I'm pretty sure if the roles were reversed here everybody would have lashed out on the guy for leaving his girlfriend in time of need.\n. \n>I obviously didn\u2019t expect him to come anymore, but offered the invitation\n\nWtf. \"I know your mom just died and you must be devastated. Anyway I'm going to my graduation and i know you won't come but here's the invitation incase you change your mind and focus on my graduation instead of your mom's death\"\n\nAnd I'm sorry but does relations and bonds just not matter anymore? And it's okay to lose very important things in the name of \"living your life/moment?\" It's not wrong to prioritize yourself when you want to but during something this serious? Absolutely not. \nYa ya you deserved to walk for your graduation because it was your moment but this was serious. I mean why even date when you can't actually be with someone through their thick and thin?", "I\u2019ll probably get some hate for this but I feel there\u2019s NAH. You missed both of your previous ceremonies so it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019d want to attend this one, especially given how big a milestone it is. I can\u2019t fault Amelia or Josh for how they reacted at that moment though. If I read this correctly it\u2019s only been a few days since their mother passed away. They are understandably distraught and inconsolable and deserve some grace right now.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Amelia and Josh are in great pain, but that is not a reason to cancel your celebration and accomplishment.\n\nYou spent years working for this accomplishment not to diminish his grief, but this is his tragedy not yours.  You asked, he did not accept.  If he wants space, give it, but don't waste your voice on him.  I suggest you skip the funeral, they are clearly hurting and do not want your presence.", "I agree, I have so much empathy for anyone going through that kind of grief, but what I don't like is the punishment of her from Josh or his sister. Josh not speaking to her when she came over? Getting asked to leave? Josh still not wanting to speak to her because she left for a few hours to go somewhere she deserved, to me that doesn't seem right. \n\nShe is allowed to take a few hours for herself. And from her account she has been their the whole time helping and preparing, dealing with grief is so difficult, and planning a funeral can be emotionally and mentally very taxing, and I know it's not her mother who she lost, but even for her sometimes people just need a little break from it.", "I disagree. If someone that I considered close died so tragically and unexpectedly, I wouldn't feel like getting dressed up and going out to celebrate just two days after. I say this as someone who's also never had a graduation because high school graduation ceremonies aren't a thing here and my Bachelor's degree graduation was cancelled due to Covid. I understand that a graduation is an important milestone to celebrate. But Jesus, your boyfriend's mom, that you were close to, died. I think you can hold off the celebration until a time that's not literally two days after her death. \n\nIf I were her, I'd have attended the graduation and retrieved my diploma, but I would have postponed celebrating with my family until the loss wasn't as fresh and everyone could celebrate fully.  I can't blame the boyfriend for getting mad at her. Going out to a special dinner with your family just two days after someone close to you died is in poor taste, seems like princess behaviour to me, and makes me wonder how much she actually cared about this person's death\n\nEdit: guys, I understand that the person is still dead and it doesn't change things. It's about respect and honoring their life and their loss. It's called mourning. Maybe y'all should try it instead of shrugging and going \"welp, they're gonna be dead anyways\".", "I was pretty close with his mom. We bonded pretty much right away (we met each other's families within a month). We'd text a lot. It was important to me to have a good bond with her and his dad.", "I agree about the funeral OP \u2014 if you don\u2019t go you\u2019ll probably regret it & the relationship will likely not survive (if you still want to be with him of course but even if you don\u2019t you may end up hating yourself if you don\u2019t go); stay back from the family unless they invite you over so you don\u2019t trigger any angry outbursts from his sister but make sure he knows you\u2019re there if he needs you, which he probably will.", "Could not agree more!", "I have to agree. I really don't even remember my graduation anymore, but I'd sure as hell remember that my partner was off celebrating two days after the worst day of my life.", "That's so unfair, she has been with him almost ALL the time, helping plan the funeral, but left for just a few hours for an incredibly important milestone in her life, not to go party at a club.\n\nShe probably invited him still out of maybe not knowing what exactly to do in that moment, and he obviously was never going to go.\n\nSo all the time she has spent with him doesn't count as being with him through thick and thin if she left him for a few hours? She has to stay with him 24/7", "He wasn't abandoned. She left an adult with his family for a few hours. And yes, it would be the same if gender roles were reversed (actually no, half the internet would be calling her a clingy you-know-what).\n\nShe let him know he was still welcome to come to the graduation. In stable healthy relationships, that is what you do. Make sure the other person knows they are still welcome to be a part of the plan, but understand that they may not want to.\n\nRelationships DO matter: need I remind you that \"for better or worse\" is part of marriage vows? This couple just had \"better\" and \"worse\" overlap, and apparently Josh expected the OP to drop her few moments of better to be there for \\*all\\* his worse. That is NOT how a good relationship works. So to answer your question, why is OP with Josh when he won't support her through thick and thin, and understand that taking a few hours to walk her graduation is REALLY IMPORTANT TO HER?", "It was mas major milestone in her life and she still offered to go to the funeral. Let's be honest, this isn't a black and white situation, there isn't a right answer here other than what op wants.", "Why can OP only care about one thing, & not both? Why is it not acceptable for OP to have a break from her supporting role to experience something positive? They\u2019ve been together for under a year, a lot of people would\u2019ve started running as soon as a death occurred but OP has been as supportive as they possibly can be the whole time, so why shouldn\u2019t she get that small respite time? Holding up someone else whilst they grieve is exhausting & if she burns out then she\u2019ll be no use to her boyfriend; neither would she be if she started to feel resentment or annoyance that she missed her graduation - feelings that she could experience even if she didn\u2019t want to feel that way. OP is perfectly capable of caring about her boyfriend **AND** about her own achievements & well being.", "It's so true!\n\nWhen the oxygen masks drop in plane, you are to take some oxygen and then take care of others. By no means OP opted to ghosted him until he was \"over it\". Even if she didn't have the graduation, we need to keep ourselves balanced so that we may be a strong support in this types of moments. Even if she needed a day to herself, it would be a healthy option. Being with her parents after the ceremony for a couple of hours was a good balance. One needs that.\n\n I just find it all completely selfish. She's expected to drop it all for him.\n\nI highly doubt that it would work the other way around", "I agree with both of the above comments 100%; although I don\u2019t feel very nice calling Josh & his sister selfish, they are certainly *being* selfish\u2026 which I guess is totally understandable in the circumstances, but that doesn\u2019t make it easier on OP.\n\nOP definitely deserved some time out from her supporting role & the fact that she chose to use that time to attend her graduation & see her own parents makes complete sense to me & is totally justified. OP even went back to see Josh that evening, which a lot of people may not have done.\n\nHopefully Josh & his family will realise that they\u2019re being unreasonable once they\u2019ve had some time to think about it; I really hope Josh doesn\u2019t continue to push OP away because he\u2019s feeling vulnerable.\n\nETA: I\u2019ve said this in another comment but OP should definitely go to the funeral, but should stay back from the family unless asked to approach them. Josh\u2019s sister is likely to still be full of rage (just because, grief) so it\u2019s important that OP tries not to trigger an outburst but Josh may also need her at some point & I doubt he\u2019d forgive her for missing it, regardless of what he may say out loud to her.\n\nCongratulations on your graduation OP; I hope you\u2019re able to celebrate your achievement more in the future & that Josh is able to realise that you needed to take those hours to do something for you. If you still want to be in this relationship, I really hope Josh\u2019s family don\u2019t end up holding a grudge because they\u2019re misguided by grief. Stay strong x", "Ok, than would she have wanted you to miss the graduation?", "This", "To me the emotional manipulation is a deal breaker, I think it's terrible he lost his mother and he can probably get given a break for the way he treated her when she came back to see him after only being gone for few hours, but I really hope they can talk and he sees what he did was wrong. If he doesn't I'm not sure I would continue in the relationship.", "That\u2019s \u261d\ud83c\udffb a good question/point although it\u2019s probably too soon to say that to Josh.", "Yeah I bet Mum would have said \u201clet\u2019s celebrate your massive achievement\u201d. We can be sad and happy. \n\nSome families lose a parent and gain a baby. We are capable of being sad and happy at the same time. \n\nLife is complicated. \n\nBe kind to yourself. You deserve to celebrate a massive achievement like a Masters Degree by simply walking across that stage in your Masters gown and hat and getting that irreplaceable photo", "Yeah I can understand the lapse in judgement because of the grief but if Josh isn\u2019t able to recognise his mistake once he\u2019s had some time to reflect with a clearer mind then I would find it hard to stay with him as well. Especially if his sister clings onto her anger & continues to direct it at OP.", "My mum died a few years ago. She was my best friend. \n\nMy husband still had to do things and couldn\u2019t be by my side 24/7. I was often alone as I have no family here \n\nHe had his sister there. You did nothing wrong. You weren\u2019t going on a week long holiday or something. This was just for a few hours", "NTA. \nMourning is a team sport and grief is a marathon. \n\nGetting through this moment you should already be secondary support to his apparently very present and involved family. If y'all are as serious as you seem to be, you will be dealing with the fallout for the next couple of years as he figures out what any of this means.\n\nThe idea that your life should be on hold until he's what? Over it? Is ludicrous. Do go to the funeral, for you as much as for him. Be kind if they are still hurting about your choice and cut them a little slack for not being even keeled just now... But you didn't do anything wrong. Congratulations on your achievement and I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. It was a graduation ceremony. It only took a few hours and you had never been able to attend your prior 2 graduations. There was no disrespect and your boyfriend knew ahead of time about it.", "NTA OP.", "My grandfather and other family members drove to another state for my cousin\u2019s graduation the weekend after my grandmother died. Granted it wasn\u2019t unexpected but still rough. 65 years married. Another cousins daughter\u2019s 1st birthday party also that weekend. The Tuesday following we laid her to rest. Though our hearts shattered our lives didn\u2019t stop. We lived as she wanted us to. NTA. Best of luck in your future endeavors! Congratulations!", "NTA", "Nta after the funeral I would take a step back from the relationship. I see if your graduation was on the same day as the funeral then maybe they would have something to be mad at", "NTA. At all. This is a huge milestone in your life. Also, I hate to say this, but you've only been with Josh for a year...if you do decide to part ways (life happens), you would have missed this graduation... again. \n\nI'm not sure why his sister was so upset with you. She had to be there for her brother when he broke down and cried? Isn't this appropriate/okay? What's wrong with, as a sibling, having to emotionally be there for the other? Why was that solely your job? \n\nYeesh, I'm surprised you haven't been more supported in this! Its not like they occurred on the same day.", "As someone who just finished a Master's program and chose not to walk - definitely NTA.\n\nAs others said, grief takes a toll on you and makes you act irrationally. They might have had the same reaction if he discovered this momentous thing about his mom while you were at work, because you weren't there, but people can't stop living life. Part of me wonders if whatever this discovery was had him and sister angry at mom but they feel they can't be angry at her so they're taking it out on you as a substitute (unless I'm misreading that sentence). Regardless, he's seen how much work you put into this degree. Take the night to breathe and congratulate yourself, and hopefully clarity comes tomorrow.", "NTA  \nI know I'll get backlash for this but...even if his mom died, you've both not even dated for a year....you're just a girlfriend, not a wife to be by his and his family's side day and night. Like yeah, it would be nice, but you're only a gf who hasn't even known them for a year, you'd probably be the outsider standing on the side, waiting for your cue, while the whole family hugs and cries because they're family who truly knows each other...you're not. This to me, is truly the difference between wife duties and girlfriend duties.\n\nPlus, you weren't out to get shit faced or do any ridiculous thing. You went to your own graduation that will lead and help you to a hopefully fulfilling and happy life/career. And even if you DID go get shit faced or do whatever...which would've made you the AH at worse, and rude at best...again, you're only a GF for less than a year, not a wife, you still wouldn't understand his family dynamics, what can you do? You can't bring his mom back or make his family better or even begin to understand their bond yet, because again...you're only a gf of less than a year.\n\nEdit: and big NTA because it's not even the funeral yet, but him and his family are unloading on you, and being wishy washy with her actual funeral towards you? Red flag.He said it's your choice, but it sounds like...if you go, you lose because they're mad at you, probably gonna start some shit if they see you...but then if you don't go, they'll be mad and start some shit if they don't see you. lose lose situation, I'd just leave my condolences and the relationship.", "NTA and I will say that even on the chance that you did actually attend your previous graduations you would still not be TA, which makes it especially worse. Getting your masters degree is a huge accomplishment, congratulations! That's your moment and you deserve to celebrate it! It's very sad and unfortunate timing with Josh's mother passing. Josh not attending your celebrations is completely understandable, but him and his sister holding it over your head is unacceptable. If anything Josh should be supportive of you attending graduation considering your past. Both of them are being selfish and self-centered, they have each other to grieve but they expect you to be on call and put your life on hold for them? On top of that Amelia's comment is just spiteful and pointed to make you feel bad, and Josh ignoring you and not being supportive of your accomplishment is a big red flag. I'd recommend giving Josh the space he needs but standing your ground that you didn't do anything wrong. Also keep away from Amelia unless you receive an apology.", "Oh my, at first I thought you was tied between going to the funeral and graduation on the same day, but then realised the funeral hadn\u2019t even taken place yet! Regardless of the situation, you definitely should have gone to your graduation, you earned it! It was for a matter of hours, not days.

He still would have had a problem, but to blame you is above and beyond ridiculous.", "NTA, everything that has happened to you has been pretty shit and this might sound a little cold but it's all really bad timing. It's really sad that your BFs breakdown happened whilst you were gone, but someone was there for him and I imagine you have been with him every other moment. \n\nMonday will be hard, after that let cooler heads prevail and maybe consider looking for mental health help afterwards.\n\nCongratulations on your graduation, most people would have just given up and I am sorry for your loss.", "Definitely NTA! He's going through a tough time but he and his sister need to sit the fuck down with the judgement. Personally I'd give him space then when he's ready to talk, make it very clear that their behaviour was completely unacceptable and that you're not the one in the wrong here.", "NTA OP. Sad circumstances but congratulations on your accomplishments/Masters!!", "NTA\n\nLife is complicated. This was an important moment for you and a loss of a family member doesn't make it lesser. He wasn't alone and them taking their grief out on you isn't fair.\n\nI went to uni about an eight hour drive from where my parents and grandparents live. Around the time of my graduation we knew my grandma was old and sick and near the end. My parents still came to my graduation ceremony (not the us, completely different). I talked to my grandma on the phone in the afternoon, after the ceremony - before a dinner with my class and everyones families that came to celebrate us. The phone call was a very special moment. My aunt called us around the time we had the starters to let us know she passed. It was a pretty strange evening from then on, but it was also a very special day for me. There was a lot of emotions, happy and sad, but it was okay. A bit weird for my partner at the time that everyone suddenly got really sad around him.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that life doesn't stop when someone else's end. And the person passing most likely doesn't want to be the cause of you missing out on important moments in your life. Cancelling your life would be a shit way to honor theirs.", "NTA, it's shit timing but it's not like you missed the funeral. This was the only time you've gotten to experience it, no one else has had to miss every other graduation so they don't see why it's a big deal.", "NTA\n\nYou have been there for your BF.  My guess is his sister didn't know how to handle his grief (a challenge for sure), so targeted your moment of joy.  Rather than say congratulations and see you later, she fueled a conflict.

Obviously some people are slower or faster. Op has been working towards this degree for years. They should have been able to walk. It's not like they insisted BF come.\n\nNTA", ">But extending the invite for him to still go was tone deaf. I understand why he looked stunned.\n\nI don't agree. I was grateful that both before and after my dad died, my friend getting married soon afterwards checked in with me about how I was feeling and what my plans were. She really reinforced that whatever decision I made was ok - if I was overwhelmed with grief she would understand my absence, and if I still wanted to come to her wedding and celebrate, I was welcome. No judgement either way. It felt really supportive for someone to be clear that it was ok for my emotional needs to be the decider on where/when I socialised, and that I wouldn't be looked down on for choosing to socialise.\n\nThat said, I think the nuance here is possibly that my dad's death was expected, and OP's boyfriend's mom's death was a tragic shock that no-one was prepared for. The result is that I still think OP was right to be supportive by explicitly giving him the choice and making it clear that he would be welcome at her graduation rather than just assuming everyone grieving wants to isolate themselves - but also, I think at the moment she needs to take any unreasonable anger/blame with a pinch of salt and give them a little bit of grace for handling a bad situation...badly.", "Not necessarily. I've learned the hard way that even if you're 100 percent sure that a person can't or won't come to your event, it's still good etiquette to extend the invitation. It's not impossible that Josh could have wanted to escape from grieving for a few hours.", "I went to a friend's wedding less than a week after my dad died. Because the wedding was a one-off celebration and my dad would still be dead after. And frankly also because I needed to get out of my own head and remember that the world was also full of good things for a few hours.\n\nI would never expect anyone else to do that for my celebration...but I would also never condemn anyone for taking a break from their grief/a loved one's grief for something that cannot be postponed.\n\nOP can't just put off celebrating their graduation, because people won't necessarily be around when she gets around to being free to celebrate again. Her friends will already have moved beyond it, people would likely think it's weird that she wants to celebrate two/three/four months after the fact - and she would have missed out on celebrating her own achievement/rite of passage again.\n\nEdit: and also? Screw you for editing your comment to imply that I wasn't mourning my dad and that  I didn't respect him! The process of mourning does not need to stick to Victorian rules for it to be valid.", "I agree too. Can\u2019t believe I had to scroll all the way to the bottom to find a sane take. And she says she was close with his mom. How is she not also devastated and wanting to just be with the family?", "it\u2019s not like Op left him alone.  He wasn\u2019t grief stricken alone on a city where he knew no one. (And even then, OP wouldn\u2019t have been Ta). \n\nHe was with his sister and dad. And if the family was all there, presumably they live there and have a support network of some sort too. \n\nOP does not owe him every part of herself.", "NTA. Your ceremony was two days before the funeral. It wasn't a wild party, it was a sober affaire, with you walking the stage and having a nice dinner with your parents. Perhaps the way you presented him with the invitation to your graduation rubbed him the wrong way in the moment. Josh was correct in skipping your ceremony- he was close to the deceased (his mother) and was in mourning. Amelia is probably upset because she had to deal with Josh's breakdown and could have used an extra pair of hands. You are not his emotional support animal. Go to the funeral with your parents to show your respect, stay in the back, and offer condolences to the family. Give him space, and know that this whole thing is probably the first death knell for your relationship: his sister is resentful, and all of the emotions of your graduation and mother dying is probably tangled together for him.", "There taking their grief and anger out on op.", "NTA- strictly speaking around a persons death there are 2 important times to be there for people, the immediate aftermath (so they day arround it happening) and the funeral, anything else i would consider a persons \"best endeavours\" to be fine.   \n\n\nAnd you were available for both those times. Unfortunately life has to go on. Congrats on graduating.", "Wait, you didn\u2019t even miss the actual funeral? It was just a random day where he happened to have a break down? That could have happened at like 3am, what were you supposed to do then? NTA at all.", "NTA, but remember his sister is grieving and so is his dad. Their reactions are set in grief. A lot of times when we loose someone unexpectedly we have to find someone/something to blame. We cope by redirecting our grief to anger. Their world has been flipped upside down and they\u2019re searching for something tangible to hold onto. In their distress, this situation is black & white, and anger is an easy concept to grasp. I know it\u2019s hard but try as much as you can to take your emotions out of the situation. They\u2019ll say things they don\u2019t mean. Try not to let it get to you. Be by his side. Go to the funeral, acknowledge his pain, and keep doing all the supportive things you have done so gracefully already. \nI am so sorry for your loss as well.", "I guess I see things a little differently than most...\n\nFirst of all, I do NOT think YTA. However, I do see how your actions could come off a bit insensitive. \n\nI think you actually CAN reschedule a graduation, to start. They do them literally every semester. I guess you would have to pay a fee again, but that would be about it, other than moving the date. \n\nI can also see how going out to dinner could seem like a bit much for the timing. Maybe that could have waited? I lost my best friend in high school suddenly and tragically. My boyfriend handled it horribly (I see now that we were just young and there is no way he could have known what to do) and at the time it was devastating to not feel like I had him to lean on. It changed everything and was definitely the reason for our breakup.\n\nI do believe the family members' reactions are genuinely out of grief and a bit over the top, but I can understand his feelings and how he is now questioning everything. It sounds like maybe you guys aren't that serious? I mean, if OP was his wife, would people be having a different reaction? Because I would expect my partner to want to be by my side. It also sounds like OP maybe could have been more clear that she just needed a few hours to attend a pre-planned event and spend some time with her parents, then she would be right back to be there with him. Maybe the lack of clarity/communication also brought on the feelings of abandonment that the boyfriend is now feeling? \n\nLike I said, definitely NTA, but I can see why her boyfriend is feeling the way he does. I think the family members jumping in was also a bit much, but I probably would too if it was my son/bother. I'm not saying it was rational, but who tf is rational in the days following a significant and unexpected loss?", "Clearly you have different values....But hey you got to go to your graduation, yahoo!! Now that you did that and possibly lost Josh, how important was that?  I never went to prom or either of my college graduations bachelors or masters...I had things with my son to do.. So I chose him....You and Josh may have different values.", "NTA.", "INFO\n\nI think we need a play-by-play of how the conversation went down. Without any context, it doesn't sound bad.

Most people who post here think they're in the right.\n\nYou might be, but there's also a chance you might have conducted yourself in a way that was insensitive or even problematic.\n\nHow exactly did you let him know you still planned on attending? What did he say when he heard that? How did you respond to his concerns, if any were voiced?", "NTA. You\u2019ve worked your entire life to get to this point and deserved to experience that. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think Josh, his sister and his father are AH\u2019s either. When people suffer such a great and unexpected loss, they usually go through not only grief but also a mix of other extreme emotions like disbelief, anger, denial, etc. And that makes people emotionally unstable and can also make them act out irrationally. When that happens, it\u2019s often with people they love the most, because unconsciously those are the safest ones to act out with.", "Cultural difference is so obvious when I see so many people having an obvious not the asshole judgement. It was not about going to an exam that would determine wether or not she would graduate but merely a ceremony. She was not pressured by her family since her own parents didn't quite understand. It was not 2 months or even two week after but 2 days, before even the burial....\n\nAnd she invited him to come with which to me is... surreal and very insensitive and that detail would definitely make her the asshole from my perspective.

Crying is natural, a good reaction in such sad times as your mother unexpectedly dying. However, \"boys don't cry\". I would guess he held it together all that time, despite needing, wanting, to cry - and then his sister told him - or he decided for himself - that you not being there for him one day was worthwhile crying over.

In my family we would have encouraged a moment of joy in amongst the grief (although I also understand Josh not going).\n\nGive Josh some time to heal. If he then still carries on with the narrative that you are somehow cruel then please reevaluate your future with him, because either he will never let this go and it will become poison in your relationship, or this is who he is as a person and will not change.\n\nDecide whether or not you would be happy to go to the funeral with his noncommittal answer - if you aren\u2019t then gently tell him that unless he expressly says he wants you there then you will stay away out of respect.\n\nThe whole world does not stop because someone dies - it may feel it at the time to those closest to them, but it doesn\u2019t.

How can good things still happen?\n\nBut that is simply not true. Babies are born and people get married and people graduate even after your world has stopped.

It\u2019s not like you abandoned him the entire time and missed the funeral. As long as you were and are there for him overall I think it is OK.

And your boyfriend and his entire family is under extreme stress and they\u2019re directing it towards you. I would give them a little slack as well. I would hope things calm down.

Grieving is not a group or spectator sport, you are able to be left alone for periods of time, the world doesn\u2019t stop because you lost a loved one.   Many people expect everyone else to stop living because their loved ones  life has ended, that is a very immature and selfish mindset.

People were upset about this but not me, and I\u2019m a known over-reactor, but I was fine with it. I knew my husband would want happiness in any form to invade such a sad occasion. Life happens & grief brings out every kind of reaction & behavior. \n\nIt sucks that the sister will probably be slowest to be rational about the situation & I would just steer clear of her & follow the funeral-attendance advice already provided by other redditors. Entirely your choice to attend, but you seem to be trying to do right by everyone here (as I would be), so you\u2019ll probably second guess or regret not attending. I\u2019m so sorry for everyone who is hurting here, and it\u2019s really unfair that your milestone happened at the same time as this horrible tragedy that is happening with someone you care about & you too, as you made every effort to be close with the Mom during the time you knew her. Best of luck navigating this. Congrats again on your Masters!! Bravo!", "NAH. Josh's family is still reeling from this sudden change and it's understandable that they are a little testy about you not being there completely for Josh. However, your life cannot stop just because your SO is in mourning. If it were a vacation, then all bets are off, but this is a milestone that you should celebrate and you did so respectfully. You should apologize for hurting their feelings, but you shouldn't apologize for going to the graduation.

I absolutely adored my dad and it truly broke me. My partner was very supportive as are you. Mine happened on Sunday but the whole weekend was excruciating and he was there with me for all of it. He had to go to work on Monday but took the off several days to help with arrangements and for funeral / wake etc.   I was inconsolable, it's just how the process is.  It would still happen even if you missed your graduation. Take it from me. You seem like a lovely person. The fact that you haven't been able to honor yourself and walk in any of your graduation ceremonies further strengthens why you did the right thing. It was only a few hrs and you went right over after. Perhaps maybe you shouldn't have asked him if he wanted to go to your graduation.  I think that was already implied that he wouldn't go. But that's out. Right now, he's so hurt and angry that he's misplacing his anger towards you. That's not ok for his family to kick you out.The sister was ridiculous but trying to give the family a pass from the shock of it all. But pls try not to torture yourself. You walked in your cap and gown after working years towards this goal. Definitely go to the funeral and all events and be there for your partner. Tell him you want to be there for him. Order a meal for the family today or drop off some pastries. That's all you can do. And ask him if you can see him and you just want to listen and be there for him.", "NTA- I get that he\u2019s hurting but to expect you to not go to such an important life event is very selfish.

It feels like it should (to the half-orphan), but it doesn't.  Other people still have life events and it is unfair to deprive them of that. It isn't fair that his mom died, but it would not have been fair to you to skip your graduation to help him grieve. He is going to be grieving the rest of his life (it will get easier in time but it never goes away). His grief should not take away from anyone else's life. It won't make it any better.

On his side of things his mom died 2 days or less ago and when it finally hits him his girlfriend isn\u2019t there to comfort him or support him. In relationships it\u2019s often the bad moments that show the strength of your relationship you see in the future if they will be there for you. My husband told me he decided he wanted to marry me when we went through a natural disaster together and supported each other. I understand your choice but i will say unfortunately this may be a deal breaker for him. Go to the funeral and support him from a distance and let him decide if he wants further contact.", "NAH\n\nThis is just overall a shitty situation. It's understandable that your boyfriend is grieving and felt he would have needed you, just like it's understandable for the sister to blindly defend him.\n\nHowever, you didn't abandon him, you didn't leave him alone, and at the end of the day life has to go on. You were there for him before the graduation, you are there for him after... You really only left him with his family for an afternoon.\n\nAt most, I'd say you maybe could have skipped dinner, but either way I don't think anyone was an A here", "NTA. I have lost loved ones and never once expected my boyfriend to not go to an important event because I was grieving. Expecting anyone, even a spouse, to be joined at your hip 24/7  because you are grieving is unreasonable. Everyone needs to sleep, eat, work, study, do housework, etc. \n\nGo to the funeral and keep your distance. Sign the guestbook to show you were there. If there is a book where you can write a comforting message, then do write something comforting. \n\nGive your boyfriend space and let him initiate a conversation with you when he is ready. If he and his sister can\u2019t see how poorly they treated you once they can think clearly, then it\u2019s time to move on from this relationship.", "NTA. You made an appropriate decision at the time and could not have seen into the future that your BF would have a particularly emotional moment at that time. \n\nI think understanding stages of grief can help you as you decide what to do next. Stages of grief are different for everyone and not necessarily sequential. The first two are relevant here, though. Denial is first. This is a defensive mechanism to prevent ourselves from being overwhelmed by the loss. We separate from the world. We may feel numb or disconnected. Anger is often the emotion that follows. It is a pretty profound emotion that helps as we step back into the world. Unfortunately the angry feelings may not be rational and fair and the target of the anger may be shocked by the intensity and the unfairness of the anger. Many people can move on from that anger and recognize that they were wrong and try to mend the relationship. Some can\u2019t.  If you can see this as part of a healthy grieving process it may help you (probably not so helpful for your BF and his sister right now). \n\nI think we often have misunderstandings of how to help someone grieving. We don\u2019t have to console. Sometimes we may hurt the grieving process by inadvertantly invalidating their grief with the words we think will console. It is better to help the grieving person know you are there to support. And here your BF may have felt some abandonment by you. It\u2019s not a fair judgment, but our feelings are rarely fair. If I were trying to mend this I would say something like \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I was not there when you needed someone with you. I would like to be there for you as much as you will let me.\u201d\n\nLastly, this death had also impacted you and you have your own grief. It is not unusual for two people to have a very different grief reaponse over the same loss and for one or both people to resent each other over their different response. Many can work through this. Some can\u2019t. \n\nGrief counselors can really help with all of these tooics as needed.", "Mom passed Thursday. I assume you were there Friday, and graduation was Saturday. You will be there for the funeral, and you were there immediately for him. \n\nThe thing about grief and trauma is that there is no end. You MUST take breaks for your sanity. I say this as a former caregiver for my partner's parent. We knew they were dying and it was all hands on deck for about 2 months, but the days leading up to death were absolutely brutal. It was exhausting. It took four caregivers to sustain life in one person, and it was frankly not at all sustainable. It was impossible to go and be supportive, day after day. It broke me. \n\nIn order to be available for others, you absolutely must take care of yourself. You have to take breaks. Bring at your bf's side every minute would not have been good for either of you, even though it appears to be the right solution. You deserved to walk at graduation, first and foremost because you earned it, but second because you needed some separation in order to be able to come back and be supportive of the bf.", "Millstone, funny Freud.", "He is grieving come on.

Explaining that a graduation is a once in a lifetime event to a person whose parent has just died is callous. Shows very little empathy or scope. \n2. Inviting your boyfriend to your graduation less than 2 days after his mother died again callous - very little scope. \n3. You figured he would be okay but did not have that conversation with him. Lack of judgement here because (rightly or wrongly) he clearly isn't okay with this. \n\nCommunication is key in any relationship and simple steps may have avoided this blow up. Personally I don't think the relationship is likely to come back from this because clearly Amelia doesnt agree with what you did and she's been very vocal about it and that's going to have some sway. Like I said whilst I don't think you were the AH for going I think you didn't think or communicate about what this would look like to them (under normal circumstances wouldn't have mattered but Grief makes all the difference). \n\nTo add you need to have a conversation with him before the funeral!!

Having said that, though Josh may not feel that way. You made a decision and you made a choice most of us with advanced degrees. I have one are very proud and it worked really hard for them.\n\nHowever, I do think that your boyfriend will think the loss of his mother trumps everything else at the moment. How you handle this from here out is really going to be the only chance you have of salvaging this.

I hope you guys can work it out.", "NTA, close to a year is not a long time. I don\u2019t personally think you should be expected to be there every second of the day waiting on a 27 yo hand and foot. That seems entirely too codependent for me. I feel for the bf losing his mother unexpectedly but the world doesn\u2019t stop for his grief. These are unhealthy expectations from a grieving family; hopefully they will be more reasonable after the initial shock of the loss wears off.

On the other you weren't there for him when he was going through the worst moments of his life.\n\nNAH I guess overall, but I wouldn't blame him if he decided the relationship was over as a result.", "NTA. The timing was unfortunate but that's not on you. \n\nOne of the sad realities of grief is that sometimes grieving people lash out at those around them. I think that's what's happened here; your bf's family has found a convenient scapegoat in you at this time. Stand your ground and refuse to be used in that way. Set healthy boundaries and remove yourself from the situation if those boundaries are not respected.\n\nCondolences on his loss and congratulations on your milestone accomplishment.", "No you were not wrong with going to your own graduation. I am sorry to hear his mom passed away. But you can not put your life on hold just because someone passed away. You would have regretted once again not going to your graduation.

That was a once in a life time event of your life. You also need to tell the sister to mind her own business. He is a grown man and can take care of himself.

I also think you should communicate with Josh beforehand so that they\u2019ll include you in the service, such as sitting with them and riding in the same vehicle with Josh.

You absolutely earned and deserve to walk at graduation and feel all the honor of your hard work and perseverance pay off. Not attending your graduation ceremony would not have brought his mother back, and would not relieve his devastation. If anything it would have brought him temporary comfort, but as hard of a situation as this all is, if he truly loves and cares about you he will come to understand that you were not in the wrong and ultimately support your decision to attend. Grief has a way of bringing out ugly reactions in people- not solely referring to your bf, but with his family as well. There is deep pain circulating among your bf and his family and nowhere to channel it, it's unfortunate that they have targeted you in this matter.

That is entirely different than you going to your graduation *for a few hours.* You are not an emotional support animal, it is not your responsibility to monitor your partner's grief. He is going to break down. That is what grief does to you. That is okay. It not okay to expect you to emotionally manage him, to be there around the clock, and to put major milestones aside. One of the hardest parts of grief is that life keeps going even when you've been sucker punched. It sucks. But its also true. You invited him and he couldn't go, that's okay\n\nHonestly, I think this situation *and you* have become an outlet to focus on because its a lot easier to be angry at your partner than to process your grief. This relationship may end \"because of this,\" but I do not believe you made the wrong decision or that it makes you an AH. He's struggling, and he may choose to do so alone. You weren't unreasonable or wrong for attending your graduation, I hope it was a good experience despite the rest of what is going on. Death does not change the fact that you worked hard for something and deserve to commemorate it, even if its less of a celebration than you were anticipating. It sounds like you *were* being considerate about his feelings by not pushing him to go or making a huge deal of the ceremony/after party. You left him for a few hours. That would have happened eventually, and regardless it would have likely been the time he broke down and cried even if it was the next day when you went to the store or to work. Yes, feelings and grief especially are extremely uncomfortable and overwhelming at times; but feeling them is the only way through them", "I'm floored that these people thought you should miss it. I'm sorry, but death doesn't mean life doesn't continue and you earned the right to walk across the stage in regalia. \"Here, miss this life achievement moment because we're sad,\" is dumb. NTA", "NTA, this is just a very tough situation all around. Neither of you are wrong.\nEdit: it isn\u2019t right for his sister to blow up at you and blame you, but you aren\u2019t wrong to have celebrated your huge milestone and he isn\u2019t wrong to be upset while he is grieving. This is one of those catch 22 moments. \n\nSupport during grief means a lot, but it wasn\u2019t like you left him *alone* - he had his immediate family to lean on. He\u2019s hurting right now, he will be for a long time, but he also needs to understand that his pain shouldn\u2019t be greater than or competing with your joy. But grief makes you blind to that in the moment. I lost my mom to cancer last year and nothing else mattered to me immediately afterwards.", "Nta", "Massive NAH. The number of people answering NTA is shocking. BF is definable not TA for wanting support and having a mental breakdown, dude fucking lost his mom. Of course his sister is going to be defensive of him and take his side, she's grieving too.", "Here\u2019s the thing - you being there probably wouldn\u2019t have stopped this breakdown. He would most likely be inconsolable no matter what. Because - his mom died. But there is nothing you or anyone else can do to undo that or take away the grief and pain him and his family are feeling. But right now they\u2019re so deep in it they don\u2019t realize that, or they don\u2019t care. You are NOT an asshole - you should\u2019ve gone and I\u2019m glad you did. That\u2019s a big accomplishment and you should be proud of yourself. I don\u2019t think anyone is an asshole here. This is such an unfortunate event, at such an awful time. Some day him and his sister may be able to compose themselves and talk this through - but rest assured I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. I\u2019m sorry it feels that way. They\u2019re in a strange state, try your best to be patient and gentle with them and yourself", "If they really just needed you there to help with your boyfriend, they would not have sent you away. Would they have been mad if you left to shower and sleep for a few hours? No, I think they just want outside things to pause, especially celebrations. I give them slack because they\u2019re grieving and things are not always logical when you\u2019re in this much pain, and people react from emotion or anger. NAH\n\nMake sure you are available to your boyfriend so he knows he can turn to you. Go to the funeral. Let them grieve however they need to.", "NTA for going but I don\u2019t think you should have extended the invitation to go, and I personally would have postponed going to dinner tbh\n\nYou deserved to finally walk across the stage, and I\u2019m glad you did.

You get to continue to be a human being even as you support him in his grief. You left for a half day to take part in a very important, pre-scheduled, unchangeable event. You didn't fly off to Vegas.

I have been there. But even if it feels like his world has broken and time has frozen, the rest of the world doesn't stop. His sister's behavior was really out of line. His grief and his breakdown are not your fault, and you cannot fix it. It is a process, and he has to go through it. I had the same breakdown literally over the shape of a rock while I was going through it. The rock reminded me of a very specific event, and it brought it all very close. I didn't have to put up a front for anyone, and I just completely broke down. It is part of the process, and it is honestly to be expected at seemingly random times for the next ***long*** while. It is painful and awful, but it is not your fault.\n\nGo to the funeral. Sit near the front, but don't try to join the family. If they spew bile, that is not your fault. Try to completely ignore it.

I also lost my father suddenly when I was just 22 but I would still never judge someone for going to a graduation (or quite frankly, almost any other pre-planned important event) because death is often sudden and unexpected. It doesn\u2019t happen on our time schedule and it\u2019s okay to keep living while dealing with the grief death brings. \n\nIf this is his first big loss, and with it being so sudden, he may be lashing out due to not understanding the emotions and being overwhelmed with all that\u2019s happening.

You weren't able to, and you wanted one day to celebrate everything you've accomplished, which is perfectly reasonable. You deserve to celebrate you as much as the timing was perhaps inconvenient. A \"friend\" of mine fully expected me to postpone my wedding because she had a miscarriage. While I understood that she was grieving, it was my WEDDING. She didn't talk to me for nearly a year afterward. Give your bf some time to decompress and then have a conversation with him. Go to the funeral, but be prepared for them to possibly ask you to leave. Once he's willing to talk, just try to explain that while you understand he was hurting, that it was an extremely important day for you (and why) and how you're sorry it was at a bad time for him, but it was something you couldn't miss. Let him know how much you care about him and knows he's hurting, etc. His reaction to the conversation will tell you a lot about where the relationship is going from here.

My husband worked every day right up to the days of the visitation hours and the funeral because he was swapping shifts around to make sure he was off for the two days we needed him the most (he was a pallbearer).  He hated he couldn't be as involved as he wanted in the planning, but it was what it was.  He is the techy guy in our family, so after work he was scanning old photos from albums to make picture slideshows and music playlists and making sure all the files were good and in the proper formats on the hard drive the funeral home asked for.  I understood he couldn't just drop everything last second, and he did what he could in the days beforehand.  \n\nMore than half of our extended family weren't even at his funeral because they had already made travel plans for the long weekend well in advance.

They\u2019re (your partner and family) all very raw right now and it may impact or even end your relationship, but they are looking to lash out at something, anything, and anyone, because nothing makes a lot of sense to them right now. Just keep repeating that you loved their mum, and that she liked/loved you, and that she would have wanted you to take those few hours to celebrate your achievement even in the face of her passing.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s a possibility that your partner would not have allowed himself to break down and let go if you had been there. He let go when his sister was with him, someone who knew her how he knew her, and who he felt safe with, and who he knew he didn\u2019t need to act stoic for. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, and also nothing wrong with his sister not being in the right space for that either. \n\nDeath is easy. Dealing with the aftermath is the struggle and something that everyone does at their own pace and differently to others.\n\nBasically, you\u2019re going to take some metaphorical hits over the next few days and weeks simply because you\u2019re there, right or wrong. Talk to your partner and be guided by him. But life goes on, and it\u2019s won\u2019t hurt him or his sister to realise that. But it may be something that will make or break your relationship long term. \n\nNo judgement here. Just wishing you, and your partner, and their family all the best in this shitty time.", "TBH, if this WAS my wife, I would want her to go to the graduation, and MIGHT even try to attend the ceremony myself.  OP is NTA.  I would go with none here, but the family, grieving or not, is being unreasonable.  Taking 3 to 4 hours away would be normal, even without a significant life event.", "The sister complaining that she had been the only one there to console him \u2014 well it can be a problem if consoling her brother means she has to push her own grief aside, but a girlfriend of under a year should not be considered to be a 24/7 entire emotional support network instead of immediate family. It\u2019s common for siblings to console each other over a joint loss, as long as there\u2019s mutual support instead of one centering themselves and expecting support from the other.\n\nMaybe this latter possibility is the problem \u2014 maybe Josh tends to center himself and his feelings, which would explain both why he thought OP should skip her graduation, even with everything else she\u2019s done to help him, and why his sister is angry at having to be his support (since she\u2019s also grieving).", "She didn't miss an \"event\".

If he doesn't get over it, OP would do well to move on.\n\nNTA", ">OP is so emotionally braindead she still asked if he wanted to go to her Graduation!\n\nI really think it depends on how she asked. \n\nIf she said something like, \u201cI know you\u2019re in a lot of pain right now and I understand that going to my graduation is probably the last thing on your mind; however, if you still want to attend, let me know. Otherwise, I\u2019ll come see you later in the evening,\u201d that is NOT an AH move \u2014 it shows empathy while also allowing the boyfriend to make his own decision about going or not. \n\nOn the other hand, if she just said, \u201cHey, are you still coming to graduation?\u201d Then, yeah, that\u2019s callous and would understandably upset anyone in boyfriend\u2019s situation. \n\nFwiw, I found out my dad died during lunch period, went back to class, and performed in a play later that day. People handle grief very differently and while it may be hard to understand, some people would genuinely prefer to maintain a sense of normalcy during a time of profound sadness, which is why OP isn\u2019t \u201cemotionally brain dead\u201d or an automatic asshole for extending the invite (subject to the above).", "Everyone mourns in different ways and her asking if he wanted to go was her asking about his mourning.

Not because of anything awful she did, she didn't do anything wrong. That's the emotional manipulation in eyes. \n\nI'm not never tried to paint him as an abuser, he can still be a great guy in grief and be emotionally manipulating her at the same time. He is allowed to be in grief and be sad, but he isn't allowed to make her feel like shit for leaving for a few hours and then punishing her for it by not talking to her and asking for space because she should have never left his side at all to go to an important milestone in her life.

IMO, she was right to still ask him to the ceremony, and he was right to refuse. He was not right to expect her to opt of HER masters graduateion/her life. I am speaking from experience. My parents have both died, my husband died. I understand he was hurt that she didn't sit and hold his hand, but can he not be left alone for a few hours instead of cast a bad memory on her graduation?

You didn\u2019t fly across the continent for a week - you went to your Masters Graduation for a few hours and had a meal with your parents.

I really don\u2019t get what their problem is, and perhaps, over time they will realise how unreasonable they have been here.  If not, then you need to move on because this is going to be held against you forever (ridiculous but likely).", "NTA.\n\nJosh has his anguish, yes.\n\nBut you don't get to graduate with a Master's every day, either, and you put a LOT of work into that, and had been denied other graduation ceremonies.", "I have lost both my parents, 11 years apart. My life temporarily stopped on those occasions,  but other than my brother, no one else's did.

Their expectation seems to be that you will stop living your life and you should be on call 24/7 to pat your boyfriend\u2019s hand.  \n\nIf you want to keep your boyfriend, you should definitely attend the funeral.  However, I am a little concerned about the anger and shunning from your boyfriend and his sister.  When my mother passed, some family members and friends were a huge disappointment,  but I never had an outburst or shunned them.  So, his reaction, even given the loss, is a huge red flag to me. He and his sister seem quite self centered and immature in their response.  There was nothing wrong with attending your graduation.  I suspect this situation will always be a thorn in your boyfriend\u2019s side, and a snarky remark waiting to happen from the sister.\n\nCongratulations on your diploma.

No brainer to me. Then again, we as a family rarely attend graduations even though, yes,  everyone works very hard also. My college bound daughter, for example, was like hell no when asked if she was attending her high school graduation next weekend. She has a performance the same weekend. Graduations always seem to councide with weddings, funerals, performances or even vacations.

Good god!\n\nThe loss of a mother trumps anything and you priortized yourself over what is one of the biggest losses a person can experience. Yes boyfriend isn\u2019t wrong to want space. Yes, YTA.

Their grief is very fresh right now, and  it\u2019s not surprising they\u2019re behaving this way at the moment.

It's a families job to be there to support one another during a time like this, OP should be able to take a few hours off Josh duty to take care of her life event. Death can be hard but life does go on, we still have to work, eat, and take care of things.\n\nI hope Josh and his family consider getting therapy, a sudden loss is difficult and is often a source of family tension.\n\nOP is in NTA\nJosh's family is under duress and can be forgiven for being a-hole-ish.

She didn't even consider the possibility.\n\nAnd I don't mind the downvotes, go downvote her parents and friends ...\n\nI hope she learns a lesson about empathy and sympathy in all this.", "No he didn't, he went through the first wave of grief and wanted to be alone, he was getting by but it all hit him at once and the reality set in.

OP just got the wrong end of the stick on this one. \nWhen my mom passed away i was a complete ass to my best friend and kicked him out my house. We are still best friends cause 2 weeks later i called him up and apologised and explained and he knew what it was. He went through it at a younger age.", "I feel like we don't know enough about this story.

I get not wanting to see anyone when you're having an emotional breakdown, but it's hard to gauge if he didn't want to see her because she left, or because he just wanted to be alone in his breakdown.\n\nBut then she followed up trying to talk to him and he said he needed space? Which is fine, but to me it felt like a punishment, she has been there for him, only left for a few hours and then came back?

That\u2019s not a casual relationship. All I\u2019m saying is he\u2019s not selfish for wanting her there. Either way it\u2019s likely this relationship won\u2019t recover. All he\u2019ll remember is she wasn\u2019t there when he wanted/needed her.

His emotions are high, and he\u2019s lost a parent very young, that\u2019s a very very hard thing to go through so yeah he\u2019s probably taking it personally and not acting like he normally is.

Even if you never had one before! (Graduation ceremonies aren't a thing in many countries and people live their lives just fine without them)\nSo yes, you were perfectly in your own right to make that choice...

It's horrible timing that BF's mother died suddenly, but what's OP to do? She's already missed two graduation ceremonies for circumstances beyond her control. This is a major achievement for OP.

And when you are stuck in your sorrow it is really really hard to watch people you know/love/care about still have things go right in their lives. \n\nSo I\u2019m going to say NAH. Because you deserved to graduate and have a day for yourself because you\u2019ve earned it and the world doesn\u2019t stop because someone died.

That yours keeps turning and you are doing everything you can to still support him and you were only gone a few hours but to him felt like a life time and was probably difficult to see you happy (which you are allowed to be) when he can\u2019t feel anything but grief. \n\nGood luck op and congratulations on your achievement", "The mom didn't die two months prior, she passed away 2 DAYS prior...

He just experienced something truly awful and sometimes it makes you angry at the world and the people who are being happy. \n\nAnd just because YOU never lashed out doesnt mean anything at all.

Lots of people want to do things and stay busy after a loved one dies, to distract them for a little while.  Josh apparently isn't one of those people, but OP had no way of knowing that.", "Exactly. Being angry is so much easier than being sad. Being angry is an effective, at least temporarily, way of distracting yourself from the pain of loss. Being angry kicks in your fight or flight instincts. There is something you can, and believe you should, do when you are mad. You can stay away from that person, yell at them,  fight with them, or punish them.\n\nBut when going through a loss, especially a sudden loss of someone close, you don't know what you should do. You don't know what the next steps are and you aren't sure how to exist without that person. You are having to deal with emotions you may have never dealt with before, or at least not to that level. You feel lost. Accepting those feeling and beginning to work through them is hard, and often, any distraction is preferred. \n\nI'd bet him and his sister worked up each other's anger to stop feeling the sadness that finally started to sink in when they had a quiet moment, without any distractions, without anyone they felt they needed to be strong around. \n\nHe's sad about the death, he may be mad at his mom for dying (which is extremely common), mad at himself for being mad at her, mad at himself for not doing something for/with his mom, sad over the loss of future he once saw with her in it, scared of having to figure things out without her guidance. And there is nothing he can do about those feelings right now. It takes time and a lot of effort to work through them. But being mad at your girlfriend? That's easy.\n\nLosing a parent when you are young and it's unexpected really throws you for a loop. You make poor decisions when you are hurt.\n\nI'm a fan of giving grace while not accepting abuse. Forgive them when they make some bad choices while they grieve but that doesn't mean you need to sit there and take them being a shitty person to you.", "***Foul?***\n\nHow the fuck is having a crying fit because your mother died fucking ***foul?*** You fucking mental?\n\n> And he let them...\n\nMy brother died when I was 10 and I couldn't speak to anyone for weeks.

But the person that I felt the deepest need to connect with was my brother. No one can understand what you\u2019ve lost when you lose your parent as well as a sibling. \n\nDefinitely it\u2019s understandable that Josh might want his girlfriend to be there, but . . . it sounds like she WAS there for him over the course of several days? Josh has suffered a great and unexpected loss, but he\u2019s also an adult. It\u2019s not really reasonable for him to blame OP for not being by his side every minute, especially given that they don\u2019t seem to be fully committed life partners. Also, maybe Josh genuinely doesn\u2019t realize this, but this sort of grief can ebb and flow for a long time. His grief isn\u2019t a justification for his apparent anger at her for being gone for a few hours.\n\nI cannot help wondering if this family isn\u2019t using OP as a bit of a scapegoat for how terrible they feel right now.", "What the fuck is wrong with you", "Have you read any of the other comments in this threat at all? It is a very normal reaction to lash out. And you saying it is a red flag is not true at all. \n\nAnd the only one who was mad was his sister. Him asking for alone time is also normal and its not guilt tripping nor is it manipulation. And like i said already his mom had JUST died. Have empathy and stop assuming someone\u2019s character based off something they did during a very rough time in their life. Thats the red flag. \n\nAnd i will reiterate, having a parent die so suddenly just days ago it can be very hard to accept that people are happy. Its a very human feeling to have and one of the 5 stages of grief is anger, either at yourself or other people. You invalidating their feelings based off your own experiences is another red flag. If Josh continued this behavior weeks or months after his mom died than i would say its a red flag but mere days after his parent died, he and his sister are still processing.", "OP absolutely gets why he was crying, she just doesn\u2019t know what she could have done for him that\u2019s different or better than *having the rest of his family supporting him*.

Hopefully they get to really sit and talk, he can realise what he has done wasn't fair to her and be able to apologise, and she can continue to go on supporting him and being there for him.", "Okay, I feel like the disconnect here might be that you can\u2019t recognize emotional manipulation.

OP spends the next few days helping the family make preparations for the funeral which is on Monday. Graduation is on Saturday, which OP and her boyfriend were originally going to attend. BF says he does not want to go, which OP accepts. Not **once** does he ask her to stay, which is important to keep in mind for the following events because she\u2019s about to be punished very intensely for something **he never expressed.**\n\nOP attends her graduation which takes a few hours and immediately returns to her BF\u2019s residence, none the wiser. And not only does the BF refuse to see her, but OP is greeted by a verbal lashing out from his sister. So instead of messaging her to let her know not to return, or even coming out to tell her himself that he doesn\u2019t want her there, he **sends** his sister to berate OP for him (saying everything he is thinking, but of course never told OP before she left). This is him punishing her for attending the graduation, it\u2019s far more humiliating to hear it from his sister than it would\u2019ve been if it was handled privately between them. \n\nFurther attempts to contact him are unsuccessful. Finally, understandably assuming the relationship is over because he cut off all contact, kicked her out of his home and sent his family to berate her, she asks him if it\u2019s okay for her to go to the funeral that she has spent the last few days helping them prepare, mind you. \n\nHe gives an intentionally vague response that it\u2019s \u201cup to her.\u201d **Again** refusing to communicate, when she was obviously asking because she didn\u2019t know if it was still appropriate to attend. He *wants* her to make the wrong choice here. So she could show up and be publicly berated by his family again, or she could not show up and *still* be shamed for being a no show. He has put her in a situation where she cannot win, he wants her to suffer for her choice. \n\nKeep in mind that this is a guy she has been dating for one year. Not two, not three, one single year. She doesn\u2019t *know* these people, and it\u2019s insane that this was the response to her attending a ceremony for a couple hours after she\u2019s spent the last few days helping them prepare a funeral. She clearly cares, and he never told her not to attend her graduation! Not before, not after. Instead of communicating, he sent his family to shame her for him.\n\nOne year in, this is a sign for many more episodes to come. Even in OP\u2019s post, there are concerning justifications she makes for his behaviour. She explains that because he cries so rarely, she is extra cruel for depriving him of her presence\u2026 when he had his sister, someone who actually knew their mother and would be far more equip to comfort him. The expectation that she be there for this specific outburst makes literally no sense. \n\nIf you can\u2019t see the dysfunction here, then you should re-examine your own relationships. This is not normal behaviour. Not communicating to your partner, then punishing them with the silent treatment and sending others to do your dirty work for you is toxic behaviour. It\u2019s an especially bad omen for one year in, this is probably the first major life event they\u2019ve experienced together and *this* is his reaction. To blame, shame and shun her. \n\nSeriously ask yourself if this is a relationship you would want to be signing up for, because I promise you this will not be the last time this happens.", "Angelgrunge. The only thing you should be telling me is \u201cOkay\u201d or \u201cI am sorry\u201d. I\u2019ll tolerate \u201cI understand\u201d\n\nNothing you told me has any substance. \n\nYou tell me\u201cI know he\u2019s grieving over the death of his mom but he\u2019s a ***foul nasty prick*** for not treating OP like she\u2019s the main character in a musty romance novel\u201d without a hint of shame.\n\nAbsolutely nothing about what you said is morally acceptable.\n\n> she just doesn\u2019t know what she could have done for him that\u2019s different or better than having the rest of his family supporting him.\n\nDon\u2019t villainize him or his family in a Reddit blurb \n\n> Is she supposed to take off from work too until he\u2019s done grieving?\n\nYou would think that. Because if it were you, you\u2019d expect the boyfriend to suck is tears up and test your like a princess even if his entire family were snatched by pillagers and skinned alive for fun an hour earlier.", "I don\u2019t know why your getting downvoted I agree. Must be a bunch of big ass babies in here. \n\nI used to manage teens and would tell them \u201cdo not make your bad day and bad moment someone else\u2019s\u201d. \n\nAnd personally, I have hit bottom. I\u2019ve been tossed and left in the road for dead. Still treated every workerI came in contact with nicely. So everyone calling this girl as ass can eat my imaginary dick. What if it was mandatory testing? What if it was a docs apt? Is this grown significant other really incapable of being alone or just with family for a few hours?", "I would say NAH. She absolutely deserved to go to her graduation, she didn\u2019t miss the funeral or anything, she just stepped out for a few hours to do something that was really important to her. I don\u2019t particularly blame him and his family for their reactions either. They\u2019re grieving a huge unexpected loss, and it\u2019s completely understandable that they\u2019re not thinking totally rationally at this point. I would give them some grace and hope that in a few days they realize that they were being unreasonable.", "Yeah especially his sister. She can butt out.", "Dating for one year. Unmarried. Are you really comparing?", "I have lost 4 grandparents in their late 80s, I was devastated.\n\nBut if I lost any of my parents I know that would be much worse.\n\nIt is common sense...", "I also think it's baffling that they're holding OP to a level of expectations that would normally be reserved for a spouse.  She's not a spouse.  She's a girlfriend of one year.  Sure, she cares and she's being supportive, but they're pushing her into a role that isn't hers to bear right now."]}
