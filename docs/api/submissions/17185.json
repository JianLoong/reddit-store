When it came time for my college graduation, the pandemic just started and no one got a graduation that year. What I really looked forward to was finally walking across a stage in a cap and gown after I completed my masters. My ceremony was Saturday.\nI\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend \u201cJosh\u201d (27M) for close to a year now. Originally, it was planned that he along with my parents would attend the graduation ceremony and we\u2019d go out to eat after.\n\nOn Thursday, Josh\u2019s mom unexpectedly passed away. It truly came out of nowhere and devastated everyone. I\u2019ve been helping Josh and his family the best I can to make preparations. The funeral is Monday.\nI really grappled with whether or not I should attend my graduation, but ultimately decided I should. It\u2019s one day and I figured Josh would be okay without me for a few hours. I obviously didn\u2019t expect him to come anymore, but offered the invitation. He seemed a little stunned but said ultimately he wasn\u2019t going to be able to go and I respected that. My parents seemed a little surprised that I still planned to go, but we went and got dinner afterwards.\n\nWhen I got back to Josh\u2019s that night (he\u2019s been staying at his dad\u2019s), his sister, \u201cAmelia\u201d (30F) went off on me. She asked how I could abandon Josh at this time. Apparently, he ended up having a complete breakdown upon finding some momentous of his mother. Josh hadn\u2019t cried since he got the news but it finally hit him that his mom was gone. He was inconsolable for over an hour. Amelia was the only one there to comfort him. I went to check on him and he didn\u2019t want to see me. I tried to explain to Amelia that this was a once in a lifetime event and that I never had a graduation before. She fired back with \u201cWell, Josh has never had a parent die before\u201d. Ultimately, Amelia and Josh\u2019s dad asked me to leave as I was upsetting both of his children.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to contact Josh since and he\u2019s told me he needs some space. I asked if he still wants me to come to the funeral and he said it\u2019s completely up to me. I brought this up with a friend and she was floored that I had still gone to the ceremony. It seems to be the consensus with everyone that I should\u2019ve skipped it.\n\nWas I wrong?", "created_utc": 1684037996, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h2bco/aita_for_going_to_my_graduation_after_my/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They can calm the f down\n\nHis is an enormous loss but yours is huge millstone. You've worked very hard and missed out of the ceremony commemorating the previous accomplishments\n\nWould they prefer you do not abandon this guy's side, and mourn with him for years to come??? \n\nTaking some time for yourself, whether it's a few hours or a weekend, it's a healthy thing to do. Your presence isn't going to bring his mum back, you're not going to fill the void she's left behind, so he chose to be selfish and think that you're his and whatever you may have going on in your life is of no value bc it has nothing to do with him\n\n\nHe's lost his mum but he's a selfish f\n\nYou're definitely NTA", "NTA, it's a tragedy his Mother passed away, however your graduation was important to you and your family. His Mother passing away doesn't alleviate him from being a somewhat supportive boyfriend, him not attending makes complete sense but he should have still wanted you to go because it was important to you. He wasn't alone, he was with his family, what would you have been able to offer? Seriously, I'm not trying to belittle your relationship when I say this, but it's been less than a year, how close were you to his mother and the rest of his family?", "NTA - it really sucks but this wasn't something you could just reschedule and it was something that has been planned for a while. It's tragic that his mother passed away but he had his family there with him, and there was no way for you to know that you were going to miss him having a mental breakdown. It's not like you skipped out on the funeral or something. Are you supposed to drop your entire life and just be at his side until he decides otherwise?", "NTA, the world doesn't stop when someone dies. You've been with him and there for him through this and you took a few hours to yourself to celebrate a really important accomplishment, congratulations by the way. Now josh and his family are in a really gnarly hard to cope with time and I'm not saying you should fight them on it but I don't think you did anything wrong. If it was me I'd go to the funeral because that sounds an awful lot like someone who wants you there but is hurt, be a wall flower and offer condolences because you can't undo not going and if you still care about josh it's the right thing to do. Hopefully on the other side of their grief they can come to understand why you went to the graduation.", "NTA. You earned that moment to walk across the stage. You were robbed the first time due to an injury and the second time due to Covid. Do not let anyone make you feel bad for taking a few moments out of the day to celebrate your hard work. \n\nI understand your boyfriend is upset and grieving over the loss of his mother and rightfully so.  It's not like you went and partied afterwards.  How many more opportunities will you get to walk across the stage for your master's? Or how many opportunities do you want to create just to have that day to celebrate?!  \n\nYou came right back but you know what? I think this is best to give Josh all of the space he needs. You will never do anything right in his or his family's eyes right now or ever. I say ever because they will always take the opportunity to throw your graduation day in your face.  Let Josh grieve his mother and you take time to grieve the end of that relationship.", "NTA- it\u2019s not your fault his mother died .\n\nYou deserve to walk at graduation and celebrate your accomplishments.\n\nHis grief isn\u2019t more important than you living your life .\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP.  This is a no win situation with this guy. \n\nGo to the funeral, pay your respects. But don\u2019t be surprised if his family doesn\u2019t want you there as they seem to have jumped onto the idea of making you the scapegoat for their grief.", "NTA\n\nYes, he is in deep grief. But relationships are NOT one sided. He should be able to understand how important this is to you, and even find enough love for you to support your decision. Instead, it's The Josh Show. You also had an important milestone in your life, it was just a happier one. It isn't as though you were skipping the funeral to go to your graduation, you left for a few hours after spending the rest of this time helping the family. I will allow a lot for his grief, but his reaction, and his sisters reaction, and the subsequent cold shoulder, are red flags to me that he's self centered even when not in mourning.", "NTA. It\u2019s graduation. You\u2019ve never experienced it before so of COURSE you deserve to enjoy that one day that for you is quite literally once in a life time (assuming you aren\u2019t doing a PhD). The world keeps going after a death. I also recently has someone die close to me, and while it\u2019s still hard, I\u2019m still living and he sure as hell would want me to keep enjoying life and doing things I like for the sake of living my life. Losing someone is hard, but one of the best ways to grieve and remember them is to keep living.", "You are NTA for attending your graduation (congratulations on your masters).\n\nBut extending the invite for him to still go was tone deaf. I understand why he looked stunned.", "NTA. I think you would have grown to resent Josh if you did not attend your graduation.", "NTA. It sucks, but unavoidable conflicts happen all the time. Taking a few hours to celebrate a massive achievement does not make you callous or a bad girlfriend. His sister is out of line and just using you as an easy target to offload some of her emotion.\n\nYou've been dating less than a year. He was surrounded by people who've known him his whole life. Grief like Josh's is overwhelming no matter who is physically in proximity.", "NTA. You missed both previous graduations and this is a once in a lifetime event. I'm not sure why everyone thinks you should've missed it.\n\nJosh resents you for going but you'd also resent him for pressuring you to miss it and not going.\n\nIt would be one thing if you missed the funeral for your graduation.\n\nI do think you should reflect on this relationship. Is Josh supportive of you generally or is the support all flowing from you to him?", "Darling you have been dubbed NTA in my eyes!", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t miss a memorial or the funeral.  And was gone only a few hours to celebrate something very important to you.  If you had missed the graduation, it would\u2019ve bothered you for the rest of your life.  While your bf will eventually move on and heal.  \n\nAnd you might not even marry the guy.  So you could potentially be sacrificing a ceremony for someone that might not be around in the future.  I really can\u2019t believe you have friends who aren\u2019t on your side.   Considering all the facts.", "Congratulations on your Masters.  NTA, even if you had been to your other graduations, you still had the right to go and get your diploma and hood.  A masters is a great achievement.  Give him time.  You have only been together for a year.  This is a huge test for both of you.  You took a few hours off.  You have been by his side helping with funeral plans you have been his rock.  You took a few ours for yourself.  I would group text the three of them.  Just tell them you understand that they need space and will only attend if they all want you there.  As for the rest of your relationship play it by ear.", "NTA. I could understand if you skipped her funeral or wake or something, but you just left him alone for a few hours. There's no way you should feel bad about this. Congrats on your graduation and I hope things settle down soon everyone.", "NTA \n\nAnd I say this as someone who had my mother die. \nI get every side of this. I was sick at my high school graduation, so I valued my university graduation even more. You did the right thing. You can't be there with him 24/7. He had family there. They are a pile of emotions, but you can't stop your life. They may want everyone to stop, but that is illogical. Give them space. If he reaches out, then go forward. But be firm in the fact you are sorry for his loss, but you can't freeze for him.", "NTA\n\nMy dad died suddenly just after I finished high school (after my graduation). The grief was hard, and I was definitely really angry for a few weeks. But the people around me still had lives to lead. \n\nHe might also resent that you get to go off and have a good moment while he is still deep in grief - I definitely had random moments of strong resentment during my first year of grieving. In retrospect, the other party never did anything wrong. It was just that I was hurting and a special kind of lonely, and then I was angry about feeling that way all the time.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong by going to your graduation (congratulations, by the way!).", "NAH. OP, you deserved to walk at your graduation. Emotions are running extremely high with your boyfriend and his family. Grief makes people react in so many ways. I don't think anyone is in the wrong here.", "NTA \n\nIt was your Masters degree. It was a few hours. You wanted the cap and gown photo after 7 year (or whatever) of study. That was not a replaceable moment. \n\nYou didn\u2019t expect him to come. You took a few hours off. If you had taken a few hours off to go home and shower and change and this had been his breakdown time would the sister have yelled?\n\nLife doesn\u2019t stop because someone died. Sadly. Sometimes we have to do things for kids, friends or other family members while grieving for the loss of someone else. \n\nYou didn\u2019t party or celebrate or go out moshing for 3 days. You took a couple of hours to walk across a stage after studying for sooooo many years. \n\nCongrats on your Masters", "NTA - my mother passed away exactly 1 year ago today. It was very unexpected. I know how much it hurts.  I didn't expect my husband to be with me every second.  Heck he even went to work. I had my dad and sister.  But if anyone had a graduation or other pre planned event,  I would have told them to go.  It was only a few hours.  It wasn't like you missed her funeral.  My dad and sister were great comforters for me as they were going through the same thing.  It is a lot different for you as she was not your mom.  It sounds to me as he and his sister are a little selfish.", "So, on Thursday your partner\u2019s mother dies and on Saturday you are at a celebratory event. I don\u2019t think you will have a partner moving forward. I mean, I don\u2019t know if it makes you TA but I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t want you as my partner.", "I'm sorry I'm gonna go with YTA.\nYou did abandon him in his worst time. I'm pretty sure if the roles were reversed here everybody would have lashed out on the guy for leaving his girlfriend in time of need.\n. \n>I obviously didn\u2019t expect him to come anymore, but offered the invitation\n\nWtf. \"I know your mom just died and you must be devastated. Anyway I'm going to my graduation and i know you won't come but here's the invitation incase you change your mind and focus on my graduation instead of your mom's death\"\n\nAnd I'm sorry but does relations and bonds just not matter anymore? And it's okay to lose very important things in the name of \"living your life/moment?\" It's not wrong to prioritize yourself when you want to but during something this serious? Absolutely not. \nYa ya you deserved to walk for your graduation because it was your moment but this was serious. I mean why even date when you can't actually be with someone through their thick and thin?", "I\u2019ll probably get some hate for this but I feel there\u2019s NAH. You missed both of your previous ceremonies so it\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019d want to attend this one, especially given how big a milestone it is. I can\u2019t fault Amelia or Josh for how they reacted at that moment though. If I read this correctly it\u2019s only been a few days since their mother passed away. They are understandably distraught and inconsolable and deserve some grace right now.", "Ultimately this comes down to do you care about your relationship with Josh. If yes then, YTA. If not then NAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Amelia and Josh are in great pain, but that is not a reason to cancel your celebration and accomplishment.\n\nYou spent years working for this accomplishment not to diminish his grief, but this is his tragedy not yours.  You asked, he did not accept.  If he wants space, give it, but don't waste your voice on him.  I suggest you skip the funeral, they are clearly hurting and do not want your presence.", "I agree, I have so much empathy for anyone going through that kind of grief, but what I don't like is the punishment of her from Josh or his sister. Josh not speaking to her when she came over? Getting asked to leave? Josh still not wanting to speak to her because she left for a few hours to go somewhere she deserved, to me that doesn't seem right. \n\nShe is allowed to take a few hours for herself. And from her account she has been their the whole time helping and preparing, dealing with grief is so difficult, and planning a funeral can be emotionally and mentally very taxing, and I know it's not her mother who she lost, but even for her sometimes people just need a little break from it.", "I disagree. If someone that I considered close died so tragically and unexpectedly, I wouldn't feel like getting dressed up and going out to celebrate just two days after. I say this as someone who's also never had a graduation because high school graduation ceremonies aren't a thing here and my Bachelor's degree graduation was cancelled due to Covid. I understand that a graduation is an important milestone to celebrate. But Jesus, your boyfriend's mom, that you were close to, died. I think you can hold off the celebration until a time that's not literally two days after her death. \n\nIf I were her, I'd have attended the graduation and retrieved my diploma, but I would have postponed celebrating with my family until the loss wasn't as fresh and everyone could celebrate fully.  I can't blame the boyfriend for getting mad at her. Going out to a special dinner with your family just two days after someone close to you died is in poor taste, seems like princess behaviour to me, and makes me wonder how much she actually cared about this person's death", "I was pretty close with his mom. We bonded pretty much right away (we met each other's families within a month). We'd text a lot. It was important to me to have a good bond with her and his dad.", "I agree about the funeral OP \u2014 if you don\u2019t go you\u2019ll probably regret it & the relationship will likely not survive (if you still want to be with him of course but even if you don\u2019t you may end up hating yourself if you don\u2019t go); stay back from the family unless they invite you over so you don\u2019t trigger any angry outbursts from his sister but make sure he knows you\u2019re there if he needs you, which he probably will.", "Could not agree more!", "I have to agree. I really don't even remember my graduation anymore, but I'd sure as hell remember that my partner was off celebrating two days after the worst day of my life.", "That's so unfair, she has been with him almost ALL the time, helping plan the funeral, but left for just a few hours for an incredibly important milestone in her life, not to go party at a club.\n\nShe probably invited him still out of maybe not knowing what exactly to do in that moment, and he obviously was never going to go.\n\nSo all the time she has spent with him doesn't count as being with him through thick and thin if she left him for a few hours? She has to stay with him 24/7", "He wasn't abandoned. She left an adult with his family for a few hours. And yes, it would be the same if gender roles were reversed (actually no, half the internet would be calling her a clingy you-know-what).\n\nShe let him know he was still welcome to come to the graduation. In stable healthy relationships, that is what you do. Make sure the other person knows they are still welcome to be a part of the plan, but understand that they may not want to.\n\nRelationships DO matter: need I remind you that \"for better or worse\" is part of marriage vows? This couple just had \"better\" and \"worse\" overlap, and apparently Josh expected the OP to drop her few moments of better to be there for \\*all\\* his worse. That is NOT how a good relationship works. So to answer your question, why is OP with Josh when he won't support her through thick and thin, and understand that taking a few hours to walk her graduation is REALLY IMPORTANT TO HER?", "It was mas major milestone in her life and she still offered to go to the funeral. Let's be honest, this isn't a black and white situation, there isn't a right answer here other than what op wants.", "Why can OP only care about one thing, & not both? Why is it not acceptable for OP to have a break from her supporting role to experience something positive? They\u2019ve been together for under a year, a lot of people would\u2019ve started running as soon as a death occurred but OP has been as supportive as they possibly can be the whole time, so why shouldn\u2019t she get that small respite time? Holding up someone else whilst they grieve is exhausting & if she burns out then she\u2019ll be no use to her boyfriend; neither would she be if she started to feel resentment or annoyance that she missed her graduation - feelings that she could experience even if she didn\u2019t want to feel that way. OP is perfectly capable of caring about her boyfriend **AND** about her own achievements & well being.", "It's so true!\n\nWhen the oxygen masks drop in plane, you are to take some oxygen and then take care of others. By no means OP opted to ghosted him until he was \"over it\". Even if she didn't have the graduation, we need to keep ourselves balanced so that we may be a strong support in this types of moments. Even if she needed a day to herself, it would be a healthy option. Being with her parents after the ceremony for a couple of hours was a good balance. One needs that.\n\n I just find it all completely selfish. She's expected to drop it all for him.\n\nI highly doubt that it would work the other way around", "I agree with both of the above comments 100%; although I don\u2019t feel very nice calling Josh & his sister selfish, they are certainly *being* selfish\u2026 which I guess is totally understandable in the circumstances, but that doesn\u2019t make it easier on OP.\n\nOP definitely deserved some time out from her supporting role & the fact that she chose to use that time to attend her graduation & see her own parents makes complete sense to me & is totally justified. OP even went back to see Josh that evening, which a lot of people may not have done.\n\nHopefully Josh & his family will realise that they\u2019re being unreasonable once they\u2019ve had some time to think about it; I really hope Josh doesn\u2019t continue to push OP away because he\u2019s feeling vulnerable.\n\nETA: I\u2019ve said this in another comment but OP should definitely go to the funeral, but should stay back from the family unless asked to approach them. Josh\u2019s sister is likely to still be full of rage (just because, grief) so it\u2019s important that OP tries not to trigger an outburst but Josh may also need her at some point & I doubt he\u2019d forgive her for missing it, regardless of what he may say out loud to her.\n\nCongratulations on your graduation OP; I hope you\u2019re able to celebrate your achievement more in the future & that Josh is able to realise that you needed to take those hours to do something for you. If you still want to be in this relationship, I really hope Josh\u2019s family don\u2019t end up holding a grudge because they\u2019re misguided by grief. Stay strong x", "Ok, than would she have wanted you to miss the graduation?", "This", "To me the emotional manipulation is a deal breaker, I think it's terrible he lost his mother and he can probably get given a break for the way he treated her when she came back to see him after only being gone for few hours, but I really hope they can talk and he sees what he did was wrong. If he doesn't I'm not sure I would continue in the relationship.", "That\u2019s \u261d\ud83c\udffb a good question/point although it\u2019s probably too soon to say that to Josh.", "Yeah I bet Mum would have said \u201clet\u2019s celebrate your massive achievement\u201d. We can be sad and happy. \n\nSome families lose a parent and gain a baby. We are capable of being sad and happy at the same time. \n\nLife is complicated. \n\nBe kind to yourself. You deserve to celebrate a massive achievement like a Masters Degree by simply walking across that stage in your Masters gown and hat and getting that irreplaceable photo", "Yeah I can understand the lapse in judgement because of the grief but if Josh isn\u2019t able to recognise his mistake once he\u2019s had some time to reflect with a clearer mind then I would find it hard to stay with him as well. Especially if his sister clings onto her anger & continues to direct it at OP.", "My mum died a few years ago. She was my best friend. \n\nMy husband still had to do things and couldn\u2019t be by my side 24/7. I was often alone as I have no family here \n\nHe had his sister there. You did nothing wrong. You weren\u2019t going on a week long holiday or something. This was just for a few hours", "NTA. \nMourning is a team sport and grief is a marathon. \n\nGetting through this moment you should already be secondary support to his apparently very present and involved family. If y'all are as serious as you seem to be, you will be dealing with the fallout for the next couple of years as he figures out what any of this means.\n\nThe idea that your life should be on hold until he's what? Over it? Is ludicrous. Do go to the funeral, for you as much as for him. Be kind if they are still hurting about your choice and cut them a little slack for not being even keeled just now... But you didn't do anything wrong. Congratulations on your achievement and I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. It was a graduation ceremony. It only took a few hours and you had never been able to attend your prior 2 graduations. There was no disrespect and your boyfriend knew ahead of time about it.", "NTA OP.", "My grandfather and other family members drove to another state for my cousin\u2019s graduation the weekend after my grandmother died. Granted it wasn\u2019t unexpected but still rough. 65 years married. Another cousins daughter\u2019s 1st birthday party also that weekend. The Tuesday following we laid her to rest. Though our hearts shattered our lives didn\u2019t stop. We lived as she wanted us to. NTA. Best of luck in your future endeavors! Congratulations!", "NTA", "Nta after the funeral I would take a step back from the relationship. I see if your graduation was on the same day as the funeral then maybe they would have something to be mad at", "NTA. At all. This is a huge milestone in your life. Also, I hate to say this, but you've only been with Josh for a year...if you do decide to part ways (life happens), you would have missed this graduation... again. \n\nI'm not sure why his sister was so upset with you. She had to be there for her brother when he broke down and cried? Isn't this appropriate/okay? What's wrong with, as a sibling, having to emotionally be there for the other? Why was that solely your job? \n\nYeesh, I'm surprised you haven't been more supported in this! Its not like they occurred on the same day.", "As someone who just finished a Master's program and chose not to walk - definitely NTA.\n\nAs others said, grief takes a toll on you and makes you act irrationally. They might have had the same reaction if he discovered this momentous thing about his mom while you were at work, because you weren't there, but people can't stop living life. Part of me wonders if whatever this discovery was had him and sister angry at mom but they feel they can't be angry at her so they're taking it out on you as a substitute (unless I'm misreading that sentence). Regardless, he's seen how much work you put into this degree. Take the night to breathe and congratulate yourself, and hopefully clarity comes tomorrow.", "NTA  \nI know I'll get backlash for this but...even if his mom died, you've both not even dated for a year....you're just a girlfriend, not a wife to be by his and his family's side day and night. Like yeah, it would be nice, but you're only a gf who hasn't even known them for a year, you'd probably be the outsider standing on the side, waiting for your cue, while the whole family hugs and cries because they're family who truly knows each other...you're not. This to me, is truly the difference between wife duties and girlfriend duties.\n\nPlus, you weren't out to get shit faced or do any ridiculous thing. You went to your own graduation that will lead and help you to a hopefully fulfilling and happy life/career. And even if you DID go get shit faced or do whatever...which would've made you the AH at worse, and rude at best...again, you're only a GF for less than a year, not a wife, you still wouldn't understand his family dynamics, what can you do? You can't bring his mom back or make his family better or even begin to understand their bond yet, because again...you're only a gf of less than a year.\n\nEdit: and big NTA because it's not even the funeral yet, but him and his family are unloading on you, and being wishy washy with her actual funeral towards you? Red flag.He said it's your choice, but it sounds like...if you go, you lose because they're mad at you, probably gonna start some shit if they see you...but then if you don't go, they'll be mad and start some shit if they don't see you. lose lose situation, I'd just leave my condolences and the relationship.", "NTA and I will say that even on the chance that you did actually attend your previous graduations you would still not be TA, which makes it especially worse. Getting your masters degree is a huge accomplishment, congratulations! That's your moment and you deserve to celebrate it! It's very sad and unfortunate timing with Josh's mother passing. Josh not attending your celebrations is completely understandable, but him and his sister holding it over your head is unacceptable. If anything Josh should be supportive of you attending graduation considering your past. Both of them are being selfish and self-centered, they have each other to grieve but they expect you to be on call and put your life on hold for them? On top of that Amelia's comment is just spiteful and pointed to make you feel bad, and Josh ignoring you and not being supportive of your accomplishment is a big red flag. I'd recommend giving Josh the space he needs but standing your ground that you didn't do anything wrong. Also keep away from Amelia unless you receive an apology.", "Oh my, at first I thought you was tied between going to the funeral and graduation on the same day, but then realised the funeral hadn\u2019t even taken place yet! Regardless of the situation, you definitely should have gone to your graduation, you earned it! It was for a matter of hours, not days. He\u2019s being over sensitive because he\u2019s upset, hopefully once he\u2019s calmed down he\u2019ll understand. NTA.", "No one's the asshole probably. Understood why he wanted you by your side cuz he's world is crashing down but also graduation is a very important event. Only thing that kinda wavers my rating is u inviting him to the graduation, that's kinda of a dick move. Better to text him that u are going to your graduation for a few hours and eat out afterwards.", "Om going to go with NAH.\n\nYou sure arent an AH, yours is a huge milestone and you deserve to going to your graduation.\nAnd it might seem like he and his family are AH atm, but im going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they are dealing with som traumatic shit and they might projecting abit without ill intentions.\n\nCongratulations to you and im sorry for your boyfriends loss.", "NTA for going.\n\nBut I can see why he'd be offended that you invited hom to celebrate on your graduation so soon after his loss.", "Apparently a lot of people here never read Rule#2. YTA, by the way.\nEdit: there they go, breaking the rules yet again", "nta. although tragic, your bf has lots of people in his corner to help him. you are just the convenient person to blame.\n\nYou would NOT have prevented the bf from having his breakdown, you would have just been there. He still would have had a problem, but to blame you is above and beyond ridiculous.", "NTA, everything that has happened to you has been pretty shit and this might sound a little cold but it's all really bad timing. It's really sad that your BFs breakdown happened whilst you were gone, but someone was there for him and I imagine you have been with him every other moment. \n\nMonday will be hard, after that let cooler heads prevail and maybe consider looking for mental health help afterwards.\n\nCongratulations on your graduation, most people would have just given up and I am sorry for your loss.", "Definitely NTA! He's going through a tough time but he and his sister need to sit the fuck down with the judgement. Personally I'd give him space then when he's ready to talk, make it very clear that their behaviour was completely unacceptable and that you're not the one in the wrong here.", "NTA OP. Sad circumstances but congratulations on your accomplishments/Masters!!", "NTA\n\nLife is complicated. This was an important moment for you and a loss of a family member doesn't make it lesser. He wasn't alone and them taking their grief out on you isn't fair.\n\nI went to uni about an eight hour drive from where my parents and grandparents live. Around the time of my graduation we knew my grandma was old and sick and near the end. My parents still came to my graduation ceremony (not the us, completely different). I talked to my grandma on the phone in the afternoon, after the ceremony - before a dinner with my class and everyones families that came to celebrate us. The phone call was a very special moment. My aunt called us around the time we had the starters to let us know she passed. It was a pretty strange evening from then on, but it was also a very special day for me. There was a lot of emotions, happy and sad, but it was okay. A bit weird for my partner at the time that everyone suddenly got really sad around him.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that life doesn't stop when someone else's end. And the person passing most likely doesn't want to be the cause of you missing out on important moments in your life. Cancelling your life would be a shit way to honor theirs.", "NTA, it's shit timing but it's not like you missed the funeral. This was the only time you've gotten to experience it, no one else has had to miss every other graduation so they don't see why it's a big deal.", "NTA\n\nYou have been there for your BF.  My guess is his sister didn't know how to handle his grief (a challenge for sure), so targeted your moment of joy.  Rather than say congratulations and see you later, she fueled a conflict.  I'm sorry for your loss.  \n\nYou worked hard for that moment that you will never have again (unless you get a PHD); let go of any guilt you may feel.  \n\nCongratulations on your graduation!", "Like a masters degree is typically around 6 years of work in America. 4 years for BA, and 2-3 years for MAs. Obviously some people are slower or faster. Op has been working towards this degree for years. They should have been able to walk. It's not like they insisted BF come.\n\nNTA", ">But extending the invite for him to still go was tone deaf. I understand why he looked stunned.\n\nI don't agree. I was grateful that both before and after my dad died, my friend getting married soon afterwards checked in with me about how I was feeling and what my plans were. She really reinforced that whatever decision I made was ok - if I was overwhelmed with grief she would understand my absence, and if I still wanted to come to her wedding and celebrate, I was welcome. No judgement either way. It felt really supportive for someone to be clear that it was ok for my emotional needs to be the decider on where/when I socialised, and that I wouldn't be looked down on for choosing to socialise.\n\nThat said, I think the nuance here is possibly that my dad's death was expected, and OP's boyfriend's mom's death was a tragic shock that no-one was prepared for. The result is that I still think OP was right to be supportive by explicitly giving him the choice and making it clear that he would be welcome at her graduation rather than just assuming everyone grieving wants to isolate themselves - but also, I think at the moment she needs to take any unreasonable anger/blame with a pinch of salt and give them a little bit of grace for handling a bad situation...badly.", "Not necessarily. I've learned the hard way that even if you're 100 percent sure that a person can't or won't come to your event, it's still good etiquette to extend the invitation. It's not impossible that Josh could have wanted to escape from grieving for a few hours.", "I went to a friend's wedding less than a week after my dad died. Because the wedding was a one-off celebration and my dad would still be dead after. And frankly also because I needed to get out of my own head and remember that the world was also full of good things for a few hours.\n\nI would never expect anyone else to do that for my celebration...but I would also never condemn anyone for taking a break from their grief/a loved one's grief for something that cannot be postponed.\n\nOP can't just put off celebrating their graduation, because people won't necessarily be around when she gets around to being free to celebrate again. Her friends will already have moved beyond it, people would likely think it's weird that she wants to celebrate two/three/four months after the fact - and she would have missed out on celebrating her own achievement/rite of passage again.", "I agree too. Can\u2019t believe I had to scroll all the way to the bottom to find a sane take. And she says she was close with his mom. How is she not also devastated and wanting to just be with the family?", "it\u2019s not like Op left him alone.  He wasn\u2019t grief stricken alone on a city where he knew no one. (And even then, OP wouldn\u2019t have been Ta). \n\nHe was with his sister and dad. And if the family was all there, presumably they live there and have a support network of some sort too. \n\nOP does not owe him every part of herself."]}
