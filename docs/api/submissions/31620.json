They asked, you gave them an explanation (which to be honest is really reasonable in my opinion), and they brushed off your feelings. They said, \u201cthis is why we never liked you?\u201d There is probably some truth to that and although your stepbrother is hurt I would tell him, \u201cwow! Imagined how I felt back then.\u201d It changed the dynamic of our relationship and all of you saw it but didn\u2019t seem to care then but now you do? No, you care because my comment hurt \u201cyour brother\u2019s feelings.\u201d Yet, if I was your brother you would care about how you hurt me. This is just another example of how you don\u2019t see me as an actual brother.\u201d", "NTA  \n\n\nFamily is who you say it is. I had a friend who saved me from loneliness and suicidal thoughts.

(Quick side note: Do not EVER go into business with friends.)", "Nta. You reminded them of how they treated you and they said the quiet part out loud.", "I think it's less holding a grudge but them setting a boundary and you left it at that.

Daves still little and from what you say hes not part of making you excluded. Sounds like that was Blake and Chris. You can call whoever you want family or brother. But Dave is 13. He probably doesn't know what AH his brothers were to you. Or like you said he followed their lead. Take 10 minutes to talk to the 13yo. You don't have to stop calling your cousin brother but you can reach out to Dave. Hes a similar age those AHs rejected you. Has he really done something to make you want to inflict that on him?", "Dave is only 13. So he was what? Like 6 when you entered his life?  He probably does see you as his brother. It hurt his feelings. Don\u2019t be cruel about it. \n\nsoft YTA\n\nedit: I think I need to expound. \n\nI have navigated having a cousin that I consider my sibling (we grew up in the same house) and having a less than idyllic sibling experience when one of my parents got remarried quickly. You\u2019re NTA for referring to your cousins as your brothers. My soft YTA comes from how you are putting Dave in the same category as his older brothers. He was not part of their mistreatment of you. \n\nHe was very young when you entered his life. He\u2019s around the age when you started to feel actively excluded by your older step-brothers. This is not an eye for an eye type of situation. Dave obviously cares for you. Instead of pushing him away like your older step-siblings did to you, apologize to Dave. Not for your post or how you feel about your cousins, because there is nothing to apologize for. But for your reaction and not taking his feelings seriously. Take him out for lunch, explain how you were treated by his elder brothers and why you were defensive towards being confronted by them. Let him know that he can come to you directly. Make an effort to get to know him separately from his older brothers.", "YTA for upsetting a kid based on his older brother being an AH to you.", "YTA-Dave wasn\u2019t involved in why you feel the way you do. What you did is the same thing the two older step-brothers did to you. Dave is 13 and it sounds like he was approx. 7 when the older ones treated you badly. Most definitely, YTA. When someone slaps you, that doesn\u2019t give you the permission to slap someone else. It might explain a reaction to the person who slapped you,  but that\u2019s it. The Circle of Scream is a terrible thing.\n\nEDIT: Let me be clear. Your post itself isn\u2019t at all the problem. That was harmless. Your lack of desire to console your much younger step-brother is what bothers me. Step up and be a role model.", "ESH. Your two oldest stepbrothers are assholes, you acted like an asshole, and everyone\u2019s asshole behavior is affecting Dave. You should at least apologize to him and maybe try to build some sort of relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Respect yourself enough not to participate in it.", "NTA. You just don't have this kind of relationship. Chris wasn't even that personally bothered; only say that it hurt the youngest of you, who given your age gap and depending on the years you have been in his life might have another perspective of your reationship. You don't have to apologize, but maybe if you want, you might want to have a little talk with Dave as the youngest, to explain your side of things.

Invite him to hang out with your cousins or do something just you and him, play a game or hang out one on one and see if you can have a better relationship with him. If his brothers give him a hard time or make him choose or something foolish like that just wait until he is older and try again.\n\nIf you continue to reject him now you will be the cause of that broken relationship and that would make you the asshole then.", "they cant disrespect you for years then when your finally happy with the bothers your chosen they are upset. if i could laugh react in their faces i would in a hear beat. your crap brothers can kick rocks.", "NTA.

The older ones were assholes to you but the youngest probably views you as he was 5 to 7 yo when you came in his life. Don't apologise, make him understand why you made that post, what happened to you. If the wants a connection, try to build one. Also, dont be offended by the elder one asking you to apologise. It is after all an older bro's duty to confront someone who made his lil bro upset. If you don't want to give a shit about the elder ones, fine but try giving the young ling a chance. Make him feel that you are one of his elder bros. That's all I can say. \nRating: NTA(subject to change)", "You could always try to explain to the little man when he\u2019s older that you were treated differently by his brothers growing up, but that you have no ill will against him.
