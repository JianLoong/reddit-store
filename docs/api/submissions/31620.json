They asked, you gave them an explanation (which to be honest is really reasonable in my opinion), and they brushed off your feelings.

Imagined how I felt back then.\u201d It changed the dynamic of our relationship and all of you saw it but didn\u2019t seem to care then but now you do? No, you care because my comment hurt \u201cyour brother\u2019s feelings.\u201d Yet, if I was your brother you would care about how you hurt me.

Daves still little and from what you say hes not part of making you excluded. Sounds like that was Blake and Chris. You can call whoever you want family or brother. But Dave is 13. He probably doesn't know what AH his brothers were to you. Or like you said he followed their lead. Take 10 minutes to talk to the 13yo. You don't have to stop calling your cousin brother but you can reach out to Dave. Hes a similar age those AHs rejected you. Has he really done something to make you want to inflict that on him?", "Dave is only 13. So he was what? Like 6 when you entered his life?  He probably does see you as his brother.

What you did is the same thing the two older step-brothers did to you. Dave is 13 and it sounds like he was approx. 7 when the older ones treated you badly. Most definitely, YTA.

The Circle of Scream is a terrible thing.\n\nEDIT: Let me be clear. Your post itself isn\u2019t at all the problem. That was harmless. Your lack of desire to console your much younger step-brother is what bothers me. Step up and be a role model.", "ESH.
