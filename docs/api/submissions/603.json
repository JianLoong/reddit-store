So I am not sure how I would feel personally, if someone did a reading on me that I did not ask for, and wonder about the \"spiritual ramifications\" via my dad's logic - like if I didn't ask for it, but it was done, is there now a spiritual connection I am unaware of? Just philosophically interesting", "They live in a 3rd world country, it is everyones business if a child is being mistreated and they know", "Most people in the community wouldn't actually do what this person did. (It's considered rude, presumptuous, and even condescending to force it on someone, as if you know better or speak for a higher power than yourself.) The connection is only there if you consent and put your energy into the reading as well. If it concerns you I'd recommend praying or burning sage, whatever cleanses you in your belief system."]}
