I own a large home. Meg spends most time at my place but technically still has her own, we are in the process of moving her in with me this fall. Since my place has a lot of room and Meg's doesn't, I agreed to host her family from out of town for Thanksgiving. I'm going to be blunt: I do not like Meg's family. They are all extremely conservative, conspiracy theorist, low-key racist, \"a woman's place is in the kitchen\" types. Meg is very different from them but is close with them. She hasn't seen them in a year so I agreed that they could stay at my place for the holiday, because I can usually tolerate them enough.\n\nWednesday morning, Meg's parents arrive, and things are fine. A few hours later, Meg's sister gets here. I have a dog named Lucy. This is my dog, not Meg's dog and not our dog; I had her for years before Meg was around and Meg is not a big fan of dogs, although she likes Lucy. I was in the bathroom when the sister pulled into the driveway. Meg's mom calls to me and says \"I'm going to let Lucy out front to say hi to Meg's sister\" to which I explicitly said \"no, don't do that. She needs to be on a leash and I should handle her. Give me a minute and I can come help but leave her inside.\" I know she heard me because she said ok. 2 minutes later, Meg comes screaming saying that her mom let Lucy outside and she ran away down the street. I ran out of the house and got in my car to drive after her, but I could never find her. I drove all around my neighborhood and adjacent neighborhoods trying to find her all day but I just couldn't. She had my number on her collar but I was terrified she was gone or got hit by a car or something. Meg drove around in her car some throughout the day too but her parents and sister did nothing, they just spent the day alone at my house. I went home and slept and then resumed the search in the morning on Thursday, Thanksgiving day.\n\nI continued searching and got a call in the afternoon that someone found Lucy. I went and got her and she was a mess; she had several bite marks and was bleeding in several places. I think she got in a fight with a wild animal. I took her to the ER immediately and they patched her up and she will pull through luckily, but that process took a long time so I didn't get home until Thursday night.\n\nToday I was exhausted and basically locked myself in my room with Lucy to watch her. Meg's dad knocked on my door and told me to be a man, and that the dog was back and it was just a stupid dog so who cares. I told them all to leave right now. Meg was upset and said they didn't have anywhere, and I said I don't care but they can't be at my home. They eventually left after I threatened calling the cops. Meg left with them and texted that it was rude for offering my home and then kicking them out, and they made an honest mistake. I felt that her mom did not listen to what I told her, and Lucy needs quiet alone time to recover, and I never even got an apology.

This could have been so much worse. Poor Lucy.\n\nDid the mom say anything to you after this?? Did anyone apologize?", "NTA\n\nKicking them out was reasonable. Send them the bill for the vet. \n\nIf they\u2019d apologized or expressed remorse, I would vote otherwise, but they clearly didn\u2019t care that they caused you such distress, let alone leading to the injury of an animal. They\u2019re sociopaths.", "NTA\n\nThis was not an honest mistake. Honest mistake is they opened the door, slipped and fell while leaving it open for long enough that the dog ran out. They intentionally opened the door and let the dog out after you already told them not to.\n\nThe fact that they had no remorse after the entire thing happened is insane. \n\nTo be honest, you should send them the vet bill and then rethink Meg as well.\n\nIf you marry someone, their family become your family as well. Are you sure you want such toxic people in your life? Cause I sure as heck would not.", "NTA. I would leave the relationship asap. Your partner and her parents don't feel remorseful for the accident/ incident. I believe they purposely did it seeing as their reaction wasn't the normal kind, maybe they didn't like that you had an attachment to a pet that would take attention away from your fiance. \n\nI couldnt imagine their reaction if you had a child and they got hurt (touch wood). They don't seem to have empathy at all", "You mention Meg doesn't like dogs, is that true for her family too? Because it sounds like it.  The fact that they did NOTHING and eventually Meg went back to stay with them in YOUR house is a HUGE red flag. Any normal person, even if they are not a \"pet\" person, would feel horrible and be out looking with you and/or calling shelters, animal control etc. That you said no and the dog \"got out\" anyway is suspicious to me.  You need to reevaluate your future because it will be run by your inlaws. And for God's Sake do not have children with this woman. There is no way to keep her parents away from any children you have and I'd be terrified for their safety. If they cannot follow your instruction with a poor animal resulting in a dangerous situation, there is no way they should be around a child.", "NTA but rethink Meg. Her defense of her family is indefensible. That makes her just as bad IMO", "NTA at all! No one should be allowed to stay where they can\u2019t respect rules, particularly rules about how pets! No, it was NOT rude to kick them out, and it was NOT an \u201chonest mistake\u201d. An Honest mistake is  doing something wrong but well-meaning bc you have no info. Meg\u2019s mom had the info-you literally told her not to and she did it anyway. They should pay your vet bills, too, as she wouldn\u2019t have been hurt if she had simply done as you said and waited 2 damn minutes.", "NTA- So you basically missed the holiday they were there to celebrate because you had to care for the dog they let get injured. They did not help look for the dog. They did not apologize for letting the dog out. Her father added to the fire by being an asshole with that being a man line. I would have kicked them out as soon as it took more than an hour to find the dog.\n\nEdit: AND THEY COMPLAINED YOU DIDN\u2019T MAKE THANKSGIVING DINNER WHILE LOOKING FOR THE DOG THEY LET OUT! \n\nGet rid of the whole woman and her terrible family.", "NTA\n\nDump Meg ASAP. Because if she can take her parents side on this, where they are so *spectacularly* in the wrong, then she always will take their side over yours.

NTA I would definitely be rethinking my relationship if I were you.", "NTA. I\u2019m a dog dad too, and I can say without doubt that I would rain down fire upon anyone who endangered my two, and I would not think twice about going scorched earth on a relationship with anyone who tried to minimise such behaviour. Shocking. Your in-laws are terrible, and arguably your other half is worse.", "NTA.  While it isn't Meg's fault that her family is the way they are, she certainly showed you whose side she will take when problems arise.  Her family wasn't left on the side of the road without resources, they could have just gone to her place or gotten a hotel while they figured things out.  But instead, she chose to side with them after what they did to your dog and harp on you for their crappy behavior.  \n\nI'd be thinking really hard about continuing this relationship, but ESPECIALLY her moving in because that'll mean her family will have more access to your shared space and more opportunities to screw with it.", "NTA you will always have to deal with this family if you stay with Meg. Consider that going forward.", "A mistake is one thing, but :\n\n\\- the mother CONFIRMED hearing what OP said,\n\n\\- they didn't even apologize,\n\n\\- they could have helped look for her,\n\n\\- they OUGHT to have offered to pay the vet bill,\n\n\\- and they NEVER should have told OP to \"*be a man, and it was just a stupid do, so who cares*\"\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you and to your dog. Their behavior and lack of consideration for you and Lucy is appalling. Meg may be very different from them in her politics, values, and attitudes, but she doesn't have the ability to stand up to them. If she doesn't develop that, this will be your reality for the entirety of your marriage. Consider carefully whether you want to marry into this family.", "A mistake is doing what they did not having asked, thinking it was ok. \n\nMeg's mother did this deliberately after being told not to.\n\nThey then compounded their behaviour by not looking for the dog and then telling you to man up. In your own home.\n\nSend them the bill for the vet. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThey didn't make an **honest mistake**, they on purpose refused to listen to you and put your dog's life at risk. And then, instead of accepting your quite reasonable judgement\u2014**these people are not safe to have in my house**\u2014they said you aren't a man if you won't let them stay there. And they never even apologized? If I did a fuckup like that myself, I'd be groveling. \n\n**Kick them to the curb.**", "NTA\n\nThis narcissistic attitude:\n\n> it Was jUst a sTupiD dOg\n\nis enough to never see them again.", "Please rethink marrying into this family.  They don't seem to have any redeeming qualities and Meg has just shown you that she is no different.  Meg has also made it clear her true feelings about your dog.  Rehome Meg and her family.  NTA.", "NTA. Meg chose her family. Not you. She doesn\u2019t like dogs. Dump her. You will never be \u201callowed\u201d to get another dog after Lucy passes.\n\nY\u2019all are incompatible.  A gf that is a keeper will live and bond with Lucy with no problems.", "NTA\n\nIf I'd been the one to let the dog out I'd have been searching with you and offered to pay the vet's bill.", "NTA\nHonestly, if I were Meg I would have kicked out my parents myself. \n\nI wonder how the family handles dogs in general. Meg does not like them, why would her sister be excited to be greeted by Lucy ?\n\nWhy would your MIL have the impulse to let Lucy out if not for a sinister plan?\n\nSorry, not helpful, now l am the one with conspiration theory. But I can't unterstand the why...", "Oh hell no! Had they tried to help find Lucy and apologised ok fine, honest mistake. But the way they acted absolutely NTA.", "NTA \n\nWhy would you marry into this family? Meg is clearly beholdened to them and will always take their side.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for Lucy! I hope you are able to figure out your relationship with Meg at this point.  It\u2019s okay to move on as there is someone out there who, along with their family, will care about not you but your dog.  This is an important thing.", "The apple never fall far from the tree . She is close to her family meaning that one day or another she will revert to their behavior . I had the same experience and I fall for it . I wish someone told me this : when people show you who they are ,believe them the first time . Make no excuse for her and her awful family.", "NTA. \n\nI would 100% reconsider marrying Meg as well. She might be \u201cdifferent\u201d but she shows you which side she will stick to when there\u2019s a conflict. They didn\u2019t even bother trying to help find your dog they lost from THEIR \u201cmistake\u201d.", "NTA. \nI'm going through an inlaw dog thing to currently.\nDogs are family. She should have listened to you about the dog. You had every right reaction to what happened to your pet. I hope she recovers quickly!", "NTA and to be honest I'd seriously reconsider marrying this woman", "Pro tip, if Meg is close to them despite all of their terrible beliefs then she is exactly like them and not different at all. Welcome to the rest of your life with her. NTA", "Nope. They\u2019re just rude people. You don\u2019t need that in your life.", "NTA. \nYou owe no one an apology. \nMeg is wrong. \nI wouldn\u2019t let any kids you may have be left alone with these people. \nNever put yourself in a position again with the parents where you rely on them- even for the slightest thing.", "NTA \n\nSorry OP. If Meg can act this way over a dog I\u2019d hate to see how she\u2019d act with a potential child. If you have a disagreement about how they\u2019re raised with her family whose side will she be on? Her family that treated you and your home horribly that she chose to leave with, or you? Based on her choices she\u2019s already shown you that you aren\u2019t her priority when her family comes into play - even if they\u2019re in the wrong. \n\nI\u2019d be rethinking this relationship.", "NTA. I would have not been nearly as calm as you were. Now you know what they are like, and you know where you stand with Meg. Is this someone you want to be with long-term? You can tell a lot about a person by seeing how they react to things like these.", "I\u2019m not a big dog person but if I let out a dog by \u201cMistake\u201d, I\u2019d be out looking for her until she was returned. Also I\u2019d be making all meals as an apology for letting the dog out and creating the anxiety. I can\u2019t believe Meg didn\u2019t step up to the plate and cook for her family that SHE invited. You should put the move-in on hold. Something is wrong with Meg & family.", "Telling an adult to be a man in his own home over defending his dog... wow. He honestly was asking for worse than being kicked out pulling a stunt like that. \ud83d\ude33\n\nNTA. I hope the pup recovers quickly and good on you for keeping a cool head.", "Send them the vet bill. Sue them for it if necessary. Make their lives hell.", "NTA. Theres a difference between an honest accident and deliberate indifference to the suffering they caused. Let them freeze.", "I\u2019m with people saying that Meg is not salvageable. I will go further in that Meg may have planned that out with her mom since OP said that Meg did not like dogs. OP should rethink this relationship.", "Nta\n\nBruh is she worth it?", "NTA", "NTA. Your partner\u2019s lack of support in such a serious issue that obviously left you very stressed is very concerning.\nAnd the fact that she is choosing her family over you...", "NTA - \"It was just a stupid dog so who cares.\" I would not marry into this.", "NTA. \n OP, your house, your rules. They ignored them and didn't offer help getting your pet back. I'd be sending the vet bill to her folks since it's such 'not a big deal ' to them. \n\nWTF is wrong with people?", "Nta. You implicitly told her no and no means no, and it was completely ignored. There is no remorse from anyone including your girlfriend. \n\nI do think your girlfriend knew it wasn\u2019t a mistake.

I am so sorry this happened to Lucy and you. I hope she heals quickly.

And very rightfully so.  Meg has just done you a huge favor in showing you a very real character flaw as well as where you stand between her and her family.  \n\nThe only potential excuse for her behavior is if she wasn\u2019t aware of the insult dealt you and even that is questionable.  If I were in your shoes, I\u2019d be done with this relationship unless Meg offers a *very* genuine apology and truly misunderstood the situation.", "\u201c\u2026just a stupid dog, so who cares\u201d ?? Oh, no no no. This man raised your fianc\u00e9e, who is \u201cnot a big fan of dogs.\u201d I suspect Meg doesn\u2019t like Lucy as much as you think she does. After all, she\u2019s on the side of the people who almost killed her.", "NTA- Please update us when you dump her", "NTA. Far from being an asshole. You were clear about your dog's needs but your partner's mom chose to ignore you and despite your clear refusal allowed your dog to get out. As someone who has a dog and had multiple close calls with a sick dog, it barely takes a second for a mishap to happen and your girlfriend needs to acknowledge this.", "NTA mom heard what you said and still decided to be rude and do what she wants to do. Meg definitely had the wrong response and should have asked you how you were feeling and what you wanted to do. Definitely could have encouraged you to have a conversation with them as they were in your house. They didn't respect boundaries and it seems like Meg doesn't really care.", "NTA. I would eat someone's soul over losing my dog. The fact that none of them helped find her is despicable. The comment about her being \"just a stupid dog\" would have likely ended with injury. Sorry your wife went with them, but that also tells you something about where her loyalties lie.", "Meg knows how important Lucy is to you so she should not have taken her family\u2019s side. Your life partner should be upset at her family for what they put you through. Even if she really thought it was an honest mistake (which it wasn\u2019t), why isn\u2019t she upset with her dad for what he said to you? Consider this an indicator of how where you stand with her when it comes to her parents. Based on what you\u2019ve said about them, I can foresee more conflicts in the future and her always taking their side.", "You didn't throw them out immediately after they lost Lucy and that was more grace than they deserved. NTA", "NTA. I would be livid if someone let my dogs out without my permission.", "NTA. If my family did this to my fianc\u00e9 I would RAGE ON THEM. They\u2019d be out on their asses. I\u2019m concerned about your fianc\u00e9s reaction.", "This would worry me and I'd seriously worry about letting Meg move in. Who's to say that she wouldn't let your dog out again if her parents visited while you were at work.

It\u2019s a good thing you found out about your gf before she totally moved in. Don\u2019t let her.", "NTA, but this should be a *massive* wake up call - Meg is not the person for you.\n\nHer first, strongest loyalty is to her family, and she is not as different from them as you think she is. She will express differing beliefs when they\u2019re not around because it\u2019s safe and comfortable, but as soon as she might actually have to risk conflict with them in order to back those beliefs up, she tucks tail. They can be stupid, they can be cruel, they can be cruel *and* stupid at the same time, but the burden will always fall on *you* to make sure they\u2019re never held to account. \n\nDo not marry Meg.", "Wow, I just read Meg's \"apology\". Dude, I mean, just wow.\n\nHere's the thing, I don't know her or your relationship, maybe this is abnormal for her, and she's so embarrassed of what her family did that she's trying to rug sweep to make it all go away. Maybe she'll come back tomorrow begging for your forgiveness.\n\n\nBut I have a dog. Not my partner's dog, not a family dog. My dog. My very best friend on four legs, and I swear an extension of my heart with how much I love her.\n\n\nIf this happened to her because of my partner's family, and they reacted that way, the relationship would be over. \n\n\nIt seems drastic, but the thought of something like that happening to her, her being lost hurt and almost killed by a wild animal. Don't get me started on the future issues. My friend's dog was attacked 3+ years ago by another dog, and is just NOW, after years of behavioral training, starting to be okay with being around other dogs on walks and such, because for years she's just been terrified of other animals due to her attack.\n\n\nLook, Meg might be great, but honestly she doesn't sound like it. A great person would have already kicked her family out for what they did and for little fucks they gave before you even got back from the vet. A great person would have apologized, genuinely apologized, for her shitty family. They didn't even help you look for Lucy. \n\n\nYou said that her family is all kinds of shitty; racist, misogynistic, I'm assuming homophobic, just a plethora of shitty attributes wrapped up in a nice bow. And yeah you can't help the family you're born into. \n\n\nHowever the fact that she's close to them is weird if she really doesn't share those values. Hell the fact that she's the ONLY one who doesn't share those values is weird. It's possible, but it's weird. It might be that she actually does believe the same things, but has been the only one out of them to realize that being vocal about it gets you some hate, so she might just keep it to herself. Lots of people \"suddenly change\" once they get married, but really it's them dropping the mask.\n\n\nThis is an incredibly important thing to find out if you're really gonna marry her. Hell, even if she truly is different from her family, what happens if you guys have kids? Are those the kind of people you want influencing your kids? And even without kids, are those the kind of people you want to have to see every holiday? It sounds genuinely miserable.\n\n\nI sincerely wish Lucy the best recovery, make sure to give her lots of love and pets and extra treats once she's eating okay.", "Y W B T A to both yourself and Lucy if you stay with Meg and allow her and her family to remain in your life after the complete disregard they\u2019ve all shown for your dog\u2019s safety and your feelings. Their behavior was ignorant and selfish at best, and potentially (because it\u2019s hard to see this as an \u2018accident\u2019 when you explicitly told them not to let her outside, and someone who truly did it on a stubborn and foolish whim but didn\u2019t actually mean for the dog to run off would usually at least PRETEND to be sorry) malicious and intentional at worst. I\u2019m leaning towards intentional, or maybe the coldness and refusal to take responsibility in that family is just THAT strong. Either way, a partner who truly cared for you would not be so apathetic about your dog getting lost, injured, and almost killed, especially when it was her own family that caused it, and they would *especially* not be as dismissive and disgusted at you as Meg seems to be for you daring to have an emotion about it. Don\u2019t wait around for an apology, because you will never receive one that is sincere. The very best thing you can do for yourself and for Lucy is to say goodbye to Meg and her family - because none of them, including Meg, clearly sees YOU or Lucy as family - and anyone else who tries to harm you or your loved ones again.", "Honest mistake maybe. But her dad telling you to man up was hudely overstepping. I'm sorry this happened. Sorry for Lucy. Sorry for you and your relationship with Meg. NTA", "Youre not the asshole. They are clearly in the wrong, and for the father to say shes \"just a stupid dog\" wouldve earned him an ass whipping in my house", "NTA. Aww hell no.  You do not treat a person's pet/best friend in any way other than they say.   \n\nI say that while laying down surrounded by my two cats, plus both of my daughters cats.  Pets are your best friends and part of the family.  If you had a 5 year old child and they just let her out to play and she went missing and  rolled up hours later bitten and bruised that would be fine?", "NTA. Throw the whole gf and family out. Terrible people.", "NTA, but i would really rethink your relationship. The fact that she left with her parents AND took their side shoes you her true colors. I almost wonder if this whole thing was intentional. Plus, her Dad telling you to \u201cman up\u201d was ridiculous.", "NTA. And I would send them the vet bill", "NTA you cant have kids with this chick, Lucy might not even survive their next visit", "NTA sorry but Meg and her entire family are utter garbage people. After what they did and how uncaring they were, Meg should have asked them to leave herself instead of siding with them, defending their bs.

If you make a genuine mistake, why would you be derisive to your host and deliberately antagonistic also? They complained there was no thanksgiving too? The fucking entitlement wtf?\n\nSure you could have sucked it up and just ignored their shitty behavior, but why should you, they got what they deserved tbh.\n\nNTA but rethink your relationship or set very very clear boundaries with her/them.", "Nta, sorry about Lucy. Did Meg condemn her family at all\u2026?", "NTA I have 3 dogs. I would be livid! I\u2019m glad you got Lucy back and I hope she is ok.", "NTA. They let the dog out on purpose.

I own a large home. Meg spends most time at my place but technically still has her own, we are in the process of moving her in with me this fall. Since my place has a lot of room and Meg's doesn't, I agreed to host her family from out of town for Thanksgiving. I'm going to be blunt: I do not like Meg's family. They are all extremely conservative, conspiracy theorist, low-key racist, \"a woman's place is in the kitchen\" types. Meg is very different from them but is close with them. She hasn't seen them in a year so I agreed that they could stay at my place for the holiday, because I can usually tolerate them enough.\n\nWednesday morning, Meg's parents arrive, and things are fine. A few hours later, Meg's sister gets here. I have a dog named Lucy. This is my dog, not Meg's dog and not our dog; I had her for years before Meg was around and Meg is not a big fan of dogs, although she likes Lucy. I was in the bathroom when the sister pulled into the driveway. Meg's mom calls to me and says \"I'm going to let Lucy out front to say hi to Meg's sister\" to which I explicitly said \"no, don't do that. She needs to be on a leash and I should handle her. Give me a minute and I can come help but leave her inside.\" I know she heard me because she said ok. 2 minutes later, Meg comes screaming saying that her mom let Lucy outside and she ran away down the street. I ran out of the house and got in my car to drive after her, but I could never find her. I drove all around my neighborhood and adjacent neighborhoods trying to find her all day but I just couldn't. She had my number on her collar but I was terrified she was gone or got hit by a car or something. Meg drove around in her car some throughout the day too but her parents and sister did nothing, they just spent the day alone at my house. I went home and slept and then resumed the search in the morning on Thursday, Thanksgiving day.\n\nI continued searching and got a call in the afternoon that someone found Lucy. I went and got her and she was a mess; she had several bite marks and was bleeding in several places. I think she got in a fight with a wild animal. I took her to the ER immediately and they patched her up and she will pull through luckily, but that process took a long time so I didn't get home until Thursday night.\n\nToday I was exhausted and basically locked myself in my room with Lucy to watch her. Meg's dad knocked on my door and told me to be a man, and that the dog was back and it was just a stupid dog so who cares. I told them all to leave right now. Meg was upset and said they didn't have anywhere, and I said I don't care but they can't be at my home. They eventually left after I threatened calling the cops. Meg left with them and texted that it was rude for offering my home and then kicking them out, and they made an honest mistake. I felt that her mom did not listen to what I told her, and Lucy needs quiet alone time to recover, and I never even got an apology. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It doesn't give your future FIL the right to insinuate that you're \"not a man\" because you were upset, and it doesn't give any of them the right to stay in your home after treating you and your pet with so much disrespect.\n\nMy issue is that your fiance's tolernace of their behavior and her being upset with you for kicking them out - means that she is on the wrong side. She should have been on them for not listening to you, for not helping find the dog, for telling you to \"be a man,\" and all the rest.  Defending you, telling them to stop or leave, demanding that they apologize for ruining the holiday and indirectly causing harm to your pet. Instead she's upset with you?

Mostly because if you know your dog is a door dasher, you should have done what you need to do to secure her while you have company over.

Chances are that you knew you what your dog was capable of that and Meg\u2019s family had no idea that would happen. Her mom should have listened to you, but didn\u2019t because she likely didn\u2019t know your dog could do that. That is a you problem that you should have prepared for better.
