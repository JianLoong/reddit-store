My sister (25F) has been my best friend my whole life. When my sister was 16, she got pregnant and she had triplets with her ex-boyfriend (22M at the time, not involved at all). My parents resented her and refused to have anything to do with her or the triplets. She ended up dropping out of high school right before the kids were born and moved in with her best friend's family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen my sister moved out, I was not allowed to have contact with her or speak to her. However, the family she moved in with had a son my age that I went to school with. He would send messages back and forth between me and my sister and help me see her. Last year, he and I got married.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister has a full time job and has her own place. She's a widow. He left his life insurance to her, as he came from a wealthy family that had one in place for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter turning 18, I moved out of my parents house. I am the only childless adult in my family at the moment- I'm 8 weeks pregnant but only my husband and sister know. But, ever since I moved in with my husband, we've taken on the challenge of hosting Christmas dinner for my relatives- since I can only imagine how chaotic Christmas is with kids. I know my sister was extremely uncomfortable being around my parents after they abandoned her. Every Christmas, they'd berate her and be nasty to her children and it's been an issue with my parents and I forever now. I beg her to come because I'm not going to let my parents tell me who I can and can't have in my life. I've only had them in my life because I feel guilty to be the golden child and just throw that away like it's meaningless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis year, my sister said she's not going to Christmas dinner because she can't handle how they treat her... so I texted my entire family who normally comes over, and I told them that my sister and I were having a private dinner this year and they could have Christmas dinner somewhere else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents have been furious for the past week, calling my house and calling my husband, my sister and myself. They've been harassing us, calling me a traitor and saying I shouldn't support my sister (though, they definitely had different choice words).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy cousins are also upset- and while they don't always berate her like my parents do, their parents do (in a much more passive aggressive manner). My cousins never say anything and don't want to get involved. I do not expect them to stick their necks out and support my sister, but I also don't want them to go running back to their parents and potentially bring drama to the night. I want this to be a stress free holiday for my sister, who deserves someone to cut her some slack. My husband and his family all support my decision... but I can't help but have some doubt that maybe I'm being unfair to the rest of my family.", "created_utc": 1671925986, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zum010/aita_for_banning_everyone_except_my_sister_from/", "score": 773, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So basically if two 13 year olds choose to sleep together no one gets prosecuted even though it's below the age of consent.
