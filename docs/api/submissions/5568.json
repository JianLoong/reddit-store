My sister (25F) has been my best friend my whole life. When my sister was 16, she got pregnant and she had triplets with her ex-boyfriend (22M at the time, not involved at all). My parents resented her and refused to have anything to do with her or the triplets. She ended up dropping out of high school right before the kids were born and moved in with her best friend's family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen my sister moved out, I was not allowed to have contact with her or speak to her. However, the family she moved in with had a son my age that I went to school with. He would send messages back and forth between me and my sister and help me see her. Last year, he and I got married.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister has a full time job and has her own place. She's a widow. He left his life insurance to her, as he came from a wealthy family that had one in place for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter turning 18, I moved out of my parents house. I am the only childless adult in my family at the moment- I'm 8 weeks pregnant but only my husband and sister know. But, ever since I moved in with my husband, we've taken on the challenge of hosting Christmas dinner for my relatives- since I can only imagine how chaotic Christmas is with kids. I know my sister was extremely uncomfortable being around my parents after they abandoned her. Every Christmas, they'd berate her and be nasty to her children and it's been an issue with my parents and I forever now. I beg her to come because I'm not going to let my parents tell me who I can and can't have in my life. I've only had them in my life because I feel guilty to be the golden child and just throw that away like it's meaningless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis year, my sister said she's not going to Christmas dinner because she can't handle how they treat her... so I texted my entire family who normally comes over, and I told them that my sister and I were having a private dinner this year and they could have Christmas dinner somewhere else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents have been furious for the past week, calling my house and calling my husband, my sister and myself. They've been harassing us, calling me a traitor and saying I shouldn't support my sister (though, they definitely had different choice words).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy cousins are also upset- and while they don't always berate her like my parents do, their parents do (in a much more passive aggressive manner). My cousins never say anything and don't want to get involved. I do not expect them to stick their necks out and support my sister, but I also don't want them to go running back to their parents and potentially bring drama to the night. I want this to be a stress free holiday for my sister, who deserves someone to cut her some slack. My husband and his family all support my decision... but I can't help but have some doubt that maybe I'm being unfair to the rest of my family.", "created_utc": 1671925986, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zum010/aita_for_banning_everyone_except_my_sister_from/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Holy crap, your parents are a piece of work.  They throw their daughter, pregnant with triplets (triplets!!!) out of the house, and now they're crying \"family\"?  Hypocrites, dump their nasty asses and be done.", "NTA. You are not being unfair. You are doing exactly what a sister should \u2014 protecting your sibling and her children from an abusive family.\n\nThe way your parents and their siblings are behaving is completely unacceptable, and the fact that they would be actively cruel to children on christmas is just the cherry atop the toxic shit sundae that is their attitude. As for your cousins, by not saying anything they are every bit as complicit in the abuse as your parents and other relatives.\n\nLastly, the fact that they're bombarding you with calls and hurling abuse at you is a huge red flag to me \u2014 **their love for you is clearly as conditional as their love for your sister was**, and you don't need people like that in your life. At this point, I'd advise cutting off contact if at all possible.", "NTA the rest of your family have  choices.  Their treatment of your sister and her children leave her limited choices.  I applaud you for doing, what I see as, the right thing.  They surely don't worry about your sister and her family's feelings so you shouldn't place anymore importance on theirs.

I only had a single son and cannot imagine how I would have handled having triplets and basically losing my family support. If your parents want to grind an old axe they can do so at home. Your cousins are enablers. Don\u2019t feel an ounce of pity for them. They are grown adults who cannot behave like adults in the presence of elders. There\u2019s a difference between respecting your elders and allowing micro aggressions to go by year after year. Sounds like they are all afraid if your sister isn\u2019t the whipping post they might be. Enjoy your stress free holiday guilt free!", "NTA. You\u2019re a great sister!

You are kind, empathetic and supportive to your sister and set a boundary with her and her kid's abusers. Good on you. I don't have a sister but if I did I'd want her to be just like you.

Your parents and extended family are the worst", "NTA.\n\nYour parents have failed your sister at every turn, since at least her teen years from the sound of things.  At 16, she should not have been with a 22 yo in the first place--why weren't they looking out for her?  Then when she did get pregnant, they owed her concern and moral support (and should have recognized her vulnerability in a relationship with a man that age)--not judgment and cruelty. Add to that the continuing bad treatment of her and her children, and that alone is grounds enough for making that call.\n\nBut it also sounds to me like your \"golden child\" status is very conditional, and you must behave exactly as they demand or they will throw you under the bus as well.  That's not love.  That's manipulation and control.\n\nNot only would I stand by this decision regarding dinner, if I were you I'd seriously consider how much you want these people around your child after he/she is born at all.    This is not the kind of talk or behavior you want your child to see and model, if even if you choose to stay in contact, if I were you I'd worry about ever leaving the child alone with them.\n\nI'd block their numbers for now, just to give you a break, celebrate with your sister, and take a long hard look at where you want things to go from here.", "NTA. Plus pregnancy can be tiring and you don't need the stress. You are under no obligation to host anyone. I would be frank about the reason for not inviting them. They have chosen to make you their golden child not you, it doesn't mean that they owe you or can control your life or guilt trip you in doing what they want. Also remember that they force their beliefs on to you (aka NC with sister).
