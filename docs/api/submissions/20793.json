Have 3 children (18m, 11f & 9f) and they are happy now. Most of all my oldest. Husband was not a good person. He was hateful, cruel to 2 of our children for being autistic & cruel to me as well. He had a very short temper & lied more than he told the truth. There's a lot to unpack about 18yrs but not the point I want to make here.\nYou see, throughout our relationship together I watched him paint this pretty picture to the outside world. Everyone doted on the fact he had so much \"love for his lil family\". That was the lie he told everyone. I & our children were miserable at home. But, to everyone else we were the perfect family.\nFast forward to his passing last yr. I grieved him, I did. I watched as the father of my children left this world. I grieved him not because I loved him but because of my children. Knowing that even tho he was hateful & cruel, they would be devastated. I pretended to grieve him on social media in front of friends & for the benefit of my kids. \nThen one day I stopped. I stopped answering dm's about \"How are you holding up?\" \"Missing the special man in all our lives\" \"How are the kids holding up?\" \"It's been 6mos but I can't get over how fast time has gone by\" ....I was done with the charade, the fake & the lies.\nI went to social media & unloaded. I laughed as I watched my friends list drop over 50+ ppl lmao. All because they believed him, even after death over me. So I ask AITA?!\n\nEdit: Clarification on what was said in social media post. *social media post* I'll not be answering anymore messages about my life. I grieved (SO name) for my children & I'm moving on with my life. He's gone & it wasn't all sunshine & rainbows.

I'm not sure I would have gone the blasting it over social media route, but definitely answering people honestly if they asked. My only concern is how this might affect your children. Do they all feel the same as you or do the younger ones still idolize him? They might still be grieving him in some way.", "NTA for sure.  You were honest without being brutal. Time to move on with your life. Wishing you much happiness.", "NTA - Why did you stay for so long when he was cruel to your neurodivergent kids? You\u2019re definitely the AH for that!", "I'm sorry that happened to you and your kids.", "Definitely NTA. Those people who dropped you proved they're not really your friends.", "You are under no obligation to \u201ckeep up a charade\u201d, but shitting on a dead man to people grieving him after he\u2019s dead because you\u2019re mad that they miss him is a step further than that. How were they supposed to know that you felt this way if you never expressed it previously? I think Y T A - that\u2019s causing more pain for everyone\n\nETA: with more info I\u2019m changing this to NTA\u2026 OP is entitled to their space to deal with this and didn\u2019t do what I initially thought it sounded like. I understand why they needed to share their truth and they did it in a way that was also respectful.", "With the edit.... NTA.\n\n\"Nothing but Good about the Dead\" doesn't make sense when the diseased leaves so much grieve and damage behind.\n\nYou deserve some space to figure out what you'll do now, how you can firmly get your life on track.\n\nIt's important that your friends know what really happened, so they can be there for you. The ones who left were kind enough to tell you that they are not your friends.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA. The idea that we should never speak ill of the dead is wrong. Some people were not very nice when they were alive, and making them into perfect people after they\u2019re dead is just wrong.", "Some people have dual personalities: those seen in public, and those seen in private. Doesn't make life any easier. One should respect the dead though. The conversations can be handled easier. Saying \"I understand if you're still grieving, but I've moved forward, please let him rest in peace, and leave us be.\" Or something polite along those lines. You don't need to explain yourself or anything else in your life to people. Most of them don't honestly care, and those that do will be the ones who know what's really going on.", "YTA, yikes.", "This reads more vindictive than cathartic so I\u2019m edging on YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re definitely TA for not taking your children away from your \u201chateful, cruel\u201d husband and subjecting them to his abuse for 18 years. I know you were young when you had your first child, but you had 18 years to come up with a game plan, leave him, and seek help. You\u2019re TA and frankly a coward for only exposing him 6 months after he was 10 feet under. You\u2019re TA for grieving your husband like that for 6 months in front of your children, showing them it\u2019s okay to treat people horribly because you will still be loved and missed, even by the people you treated the worst, when you\u2019re gone. You\u2019re not TA for actually exposing him, but it\u2019s too little too late in my opinion.", "I personally don't think it hurts to post it on social media. The truth is this is your truth. You have a right to tell your story even if others don't like it. \n\nMy father is the same way. My Mom died from ALS a few years ago and he puts on this face to the real world. This big shot in a national social club. He's not aware of this but when his time comes he won't be celebrated. He won't even get a goodbye or a funeral. In fact he took off and moved 1000 miles away the day of her celebration of life and refused to attend the one my sisters and I threw claiming she didn't want one. She told us for over 40 years it's what she wanted. His body will remain in a cemetery for unclaimed people who currently live in the retirement community he is a part of. Much different then the original plan of being buried with his entire family where his wife is. His family has been in the same cemetery for 150 years...but not him. Nobody will be visiting. His Grandchildren have nothing to do with him. He will be forgotten quickly and that's the way it should be.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't have waited until he died, but that's me.\n\nYou learnt who your actual friends are, you spoke up and shared the truth. It's win-win.", "NTA.
