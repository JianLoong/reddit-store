I grieved him not because I loved him but because of my children. Knowing that even tho he was hateful & cruel, they would be devastated. I pretended to grieve him on social media in front of friends & for the benefit of my kids. \nThen one day I stopped.

You\u2019re definitely TA for not taking your children away from your \u201chateful, cruel\u201d husband and subjecting them to his abuse for 18 years. I know you were young when you had your first child, but you had 18 years to come up with a game plan, leave him, and seek help. You\u2019re TA and frankly a coward for only exposing him 6 months after he was 10 feet under. You\u2019re TA for grieving your husband like that for 6 months in front of your children, showing them it\u2019s okay to treat people horribly because you will still be loved and missed, even by the people you treated the worst, when you\u2019re gone. You\u2019re not TA for actually exposing him, but it\u2019s too little too late in my opinion.", "I personally don't think it hurts to post it on social media. The truth is this is your truth. You have a right to tell your story even if others don't like it. \n\nMy father is the same way. My Mom died from ALS a few years ago and he puts on this face to the real world. This big shot in a national social club. He's not aware of this but when his time comes he won't be celebrated. He won't even get a goodbye or a funeral. In fact he took off and moved 1000 miles away the day of her celebration of life and refused to attend the one my sisters and I threw claiming she didn't want one. She told us for over 40 years it's what she wanted. His body will remain in a cemetery for unclaimed people who currently live in the retirement community he is a part of. Much different then the original plan of being buried with his entire family where his wife is. His family has been in the same cemetery for 150 years...but not him. Nobody will be visiting. His Grandchildren have nothing to do with him. He will be forgotten quickly and that's the way it should be.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't have waited until he died, but that's me.\n\nYou learnt who your actual friends are, you spoke up and shared the truth.

You will likely never know what other lies your ex had been drip feeding about you to these people, but do you really care? They\u2019ve chosen their side and quite frankly good riddance to them. As they say, the trash has taken itself out.\n\nThat being said, for your own sanity I personally would keep it at that. If anyone asks for your side I\u2019d double check that they really wanted to hear it, because people can be a*holes when someone challenges their world view - which in this case is that deceased-ex was a wonderful family man. I\u2019m speaking from experience here. The best revenge on any abuser is a life well lived, so I hope you and your children have AMAZING lives!", "NTA\n\nPersonally I have a \"lovely\" eulogy planned for my abusive dad", "NTA. The public part was benign as heck and you only gave more details to people who specifically requested them privately. It's not your fault that he was awful and kept you and your kids trapped for so many years. If he wanted to be remembered fondly he should have behaved better when he was alive. \n\nThe people who are upset don't want to accept that they loved/ admired/ were friends with someone so abhorrent. That's their issue, not yours. They did show you they aren't your friends, so good riddance. Your kids don't need people in their lives gaslighting them about how their dad behaved.

Relationships with narcissists are usually quite harmful, traumatic for the spouse and children.\n\nTNarcissists present the themselves as the perfect spouse, having the perfect life etc.  So others who only know them casually do not see the problems.\n\nIt can be cathartic to let others know what the believes was a lie, but does it solve anything?\n\nBet here for your kids.  they know the truth.  Help them get over this.", "That\u2019s a super fucked up and ignorant take. Abusive relationships are incredibly complicated and dangerous. The most dangerous point being when they attempt to leave.

The message you posted in your edit is very vaguebook-y and if I saw that on my FB about someone I had every reason to believe was a nice person I would be alarmed.

Him being hurtful & cruel was more towards me than them. I had to stay because he kept me financially dependent, I wasn't allowed to drive. When he lost his license and I had to start driving him around, he gave me just enough money to get him back and forth to work & kids back & forth to school. I had no one & no where to go for a long time. Every time I planned to leave he left me no choice but to depend on him. I haven't had a job in 13yrs. Every time I attempted to get one he made it to where I had to quit or refuse the job because he wouldn't take me. I didn't have money for public transit. \nSo tell me again how you would do it.", "You cannot post something like that, in that vague of way and not understand it\u2019s basically begging for drama.", "After reading your post I'm reminded of the book Speaker for the Dead, where someone comes along and gives the truth about the deceased.\n\nOur culture would be devastated if this actually happened.", "NTA exactly but edging on toward you being TA because vaguebook posting is awkward and though I don't know the circumstances, sticking with an abuser when you have kids is an AH move.  You say they are happy but trust me, they are not well.   I've known people that stuck with their abusers because they thought they had no other choice... but I believe there's always options, especially when children are being damaged FOR LIFE due to abuse.  They will feel the effects of this especially in all future relationships.  And they will cringe every time they hear others talk about how great their father was while their home life memories were far different.  They will also likely become angry with you as they get to be adults and realized you stood by and did nothing.  You and they all need therapy to help with this, please find it.", "NTA my father was 'difficult,' but charmed people outside the family. I was not at his funeral, my brother recently told me that at the funeral my mother was so joyful, it was almost embarrassing. However my brother and I totally understood and were on her side.", "YTA. If you are unloading on people for a man they loved after he died, it is not unreasonable for them to not want to engage. In addition, you feel attacked that everyone is thinking you stayed idly by, when almost all the comments are on your side. Maybe you have a victim complex? You could have done something to get out, but you chose not to. You have to put some responsibility on yourself for your life decisions.", "YTA for putting it on social media.

Don\u2019t even DM. \nBut NTA for feeling this way", "I think that was pretty general and can be said about most relationships", "I wasn't begging for drama but I didn't have to type it all out for anyone either.

Good luck OP", "NTA given the context, I totally get it. But your post was very vaguebook-ish and aggressive. I wouldn't have been able to read between the lines and would have found it extremely off-putting. Honestly, it seemed like you were more annoyed at people for trying to be supportive than explaining that your SO was abusive.

Be careful", "Not mad. Thank you for your opinion.", "What you\u2019re describing is literally middle school drama. You wanted to be asked to spill the deets. How is typing answers privately any different? It\u2019s such childish behavior. Not the feelings, I hear you on that, but the vague facebook stuff is ludicrously childish.", "I mean, it feels like most people are on your side here, but you come with a kind of snarky-sounding message that everyone assumes you did nothing. In the post, you talk about how everyone believed your ex over you, even in death. In addition, you give all sorts of reasons why you could not leave. I actually meant victim complex, which is pretty evident.", "I can definitely see why you felt the need to though. I\u2019m sure it was frustrating", "I mean really, though. What did you expect to happen? EVERY spouse can truthfully say their marriage isn't all roses and sunshine. Most people wouldn't leap to \"OMG, she was abused!\" They would assume, with justification based on your husband's outward life and your own history of never speaking up, that you are simply done mourning a guy who [didn't clean the bathroom enough, forgot to feed the cat every day, played video games too long, etc.] You come across as a jerk, not a victim. Was that your intention?\n\nPeople who were your husband's friend, not particularly yours, will obviously just unfriend you rather than confront you.", "Because this person is a middle schooler with the way they type", "Ok. :) Thank you.", "That's how you feel I understand. But never the less I'm just looking for opinions on the matter discussed. Not a victim either hun. You don't seem to know which \"complex\" you think I may or may not have. But I digress, thank you for your opinions & judgement.", "I think posting vague, somewhat aggressive things and assuming people will reach out to you if they're real friends feels like putting your friends through a test to me and I avoid people who do that kind of thing. I have removed people with a tendency toward vaguebooking from my life in the past. Granted, I don't know if OP has such a tendency or not, but I can certainly see people having a low tolerance for that sort of thing.", "Ok. Thanks.", "Lol, okay. My answer was completely on topic, though. Read it again, and you'll understand why you're being cut off.", "I have never heard the term vaguebooking before, but I know what you mean. I have a FB friend who does that, then when someone comments to ask if she's ok or what happened, she responds that she will dm them. Like why not just message one of your close friends directly in the first place then? It just seems like a cry for attention and it annoys me so much, I periodically have to mute her so I don't see those posts.", "I think the term has been around a while, and I suspect with people who do it regularly, they've often alienated a lot of the people who would listen to them through trauma dumping or one-sided venting that isn't matched by offering their friends similar support."]}
