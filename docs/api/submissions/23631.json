Closing the door after the deed is done isn't going to help that stink dissipate quickly, and when you open that door for your morning pee you will get hit with an angry cloud of poo gas eager to escape. \n\nClose the door while you poop and turn on the fan is the standard practice in our home.   If you don't want anyone to know what you are doing in there then always close the door and turn on the fan. \n\nAlso, big fan of courtesy flush.  I feel like at first drop if you flush it sucks some of the stink out of the bowl.  It might not be scientific, but I believe it works.

I use the one in the bedroom en suite, and my son and husband use the other one. They drop bombs and make the bathroom a danger zone for an hour or so.

The captains work in communicating but eventually scary monster hurts the alien captain. As the alien captain is dying, Picard has a breakthrough. The alien communicates via \u201cbrief allusions to their history and mythology to convey thoughts and intentions.\u201d Darmok and Jalad is the story of two warriors (D & J) who ended up meeting on an island (Tanagra) and had to combine forces to beat an enemy.

Humans have always had always had references to stories and history to communicate (Trojan horse, for example). But with the advent of the internet, we now have the ability to \u201cspread our stories far and wide.\u201d The writers of Star Trek were simply amazing in that they picked up on key concepts (cell phones, video conferencing, laptops, pads) that have become increasingly common in the world.\n\nBefore we could only reference stories and history within our small population group via these lshortcut phrases.\u201d There was simply no way to spread information around.
