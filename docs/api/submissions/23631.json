It practically burned my skin off. Point is, people are selfish.", "Dang. As far as I'm aware, my wife doesn't poop.

If she can't be reasonable, get one of those automatic door closers so that it pulls the door shut after the person walks through.", "NTA also I think it\u2019s just the worst to leave a bathroom door open.

I also know too many women who have been shamed by their partners for having natural bodily functions and that\u2019s really lame that they have to put up with that.

I'd latch onto that one with a death grip.\n\nMake it an over the top ridiculous reaction to her ridiculous reaction to your very simple request.\n\nI'd put no less than 10 cans of air freshener in there, a sign requesting the courtesy flush, and another requesting that all toxic fumes be secured behind the door upon leaving. Probably hang the toxic symbol on the door.\n\nThen, carry on with my day as if she isn't having a complete meltdown in the background cause she will.

It\u2019s how I was raised. \n\nThere is this fabulous product called PooPourri which you spray on the water before using the toilet. It\u2019s not a perfume so it doesn\u2019t usually bother sensitive noses. It\u2019s essential oils and traps the stink from leaving. Also, doing this in addition to things like a \u201ccourtesy flush\u201d can really make the smell not be noticeable. \n\nBe an adult with a partner. Sit down with her and talk about this as an adult. Talk about the compromises and remedies for this trivial issue. Closing the door is only one solution out of multiple so find one that works for you both.", "NAH, but you have to pick your battles in a marriage. Your request is valid, and so is her feeling insecure about your comment on something women are taught to think is gross about our bodies (regardless of everyone doing it). I suggest it just needs to be asked for more delicately.", "Do you not have an extractor fan in your bathroom?\n\nIf so, it should be on when there is poo-time happening. \n\nIt is the Indicator Of Poo Time in this house:\n\n- him: why are you running upstairs?\n\n- me: switches on fan on my way in\n\n- him: never mind :-)\n\nThen the door can be left open afterwards.", "Buy some poopouri.

While it's no issue you want the door closed, telling her it's gross is going to really hurt her coming from her husband who's supposed to love her unconditionally.\n\nAlso, making it about \"the principle\" regardless of the smell tells me you're more trying to push your own upbringing on your wife which isn't very cool.", "YTA.

Here's hoping your wife is more considerate and understands better once you have had a chat about it.", "NTA, maybe she likes the smell or something cause it\u2019s weird that she thinks it doesn\u2019t smell bad and that you should have to smell it instead of using the fan", "I mean, wouldn't it be better to ask her to turn the bathroom fan on if she knows she's going to poop?  Closing the door after the deed is done isn't going to help that stink dissipate quickly, and when you open that door for your morning pee you will get hit with an angry cloud of poo gas eager to escape. \n\nClose the door while you poop and turn on the fan is the standard practice in our home.   If you don't want anyone to know what you are doing in there then always close the door and turn on the fan. \n\nAlso, big fan of courtesy flush.  I feel like at first drop if you flush it sucks some of the stink out of the bowl.  It might not be scientific, but I believe it works. Especially if it's going to be one of those poohs where it's going to take some time. I don't want to sit in that \"aroma\" any longer than necessary.", "Nah I don't think you're an ahole for asking, although it is odd. Esp bc you say the smell isn't the problem.  She flushes and has the fan going, so you literally had to ask if she went bc you didn't know.\n\nShe's not an ahole either bc it *is* an odd request.\n\nYou are, however *leaning* towards ahole bc you didn't really ask. You DEMANDED.   An ask has a yes or no answer.  A demand will only accept a Yes. You will only accept a yes.  \n\nAnd I hope you realize if you keep making this an issue, there's a good chance she will start bringing up some annoying thing you do and demanding yoi change to suit her.", "NTA, I'm so thankful we've got two bathrooms at our house. I use the one in the bedroom en suite, and my son and husband use the other one. They drop bombs and make the bathroom a danger zone for an hour or so. I usually leave my door open, but if I leave it stinky, I turn the exhaust on and shut the door. There's nothing wrong with asking her to shut the door. I also won't poop in mine if my husband is still sleeping, as that's just rude.", "NTA.  \n\n\nGod forbid you ask someone to provide one of the simplest, low-effort courtesies that they possibly could.   \n\n\nNext she'll be complaining that she shouldn't have to flush either.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, I wonder about you calling this \"troubling behavior.\" Yes, she's being inconsiderate, but did you phrase it like this because it's a huge deal to you or are there other, similar things she does like this that are part of the problem? TBH, it's a crappy thing for her to do but not overall \"troubling\" IMHO unless it's one part of a larger issue.", "When youre in that close proximity, NTA at all. It\u2019s the only courteous thing to do.", "So go buy poopouri and ask her to use it.  Also she should just close the door. Nobody wants to smell poo. NTA at all.  Everybody and everything poops and I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s insecure but also everyone\u2019s poop smells terrible.  It\u2019s not hard to close the door.", "NTA. That's common courtesy.
