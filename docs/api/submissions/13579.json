Like, she's EXTREMELY attractive, to the point where I've always been a little worried about introducing boyfriends to her out of fear they'll get smitten with her. For reference, she looks about 15-20 years younger than she is, and would be very attractive for a 30 year old. Anyway, last week I went by her house to pick her up for lunch when I saw this guy about my age leaving. At first I thought he must've been a salesman or something, but the way my mother let him go (with a passionate kiss on the lips) let me know they were involved. After he left, my mom told me that the guy was her boyfriend and that they'd been dating for the last four months, and she told me he was 23. I was shocked, as the guy was literally younger than me and he was dating my mom, and I told her so. We went back and forth about this, as I told her that the guy was too young for her and was probably just out for her money or something, and she countered by telling me to stay out of her love life. Suffice to say we didn't leave on great terms, as I told her to grow up before leaving, and we haven't really spoken since. I think I'm just gonna let this play out until her midlife crisis wears off, and I don't really think I did anything wrong because my mom's relationship is gross to begin with.", "created_utc": 1680198178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126u0ay/aita_for_telling_my_mother_to_grow_up/", "score": 970, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While I sympathize with her wanting to regain her youth, once again: her actions can\u2019t exist in a vacuum and she has to deal with the fact that she\u2019s not 25 and has an adult daughter.

For people asking why it is problematic in the comments, the most important thing to consider in an age gao relationship is where the people are in their life. 23 and 49 are in very different places in their life, and the power imbalance is pretty prominent. 23 is fairly fresh out of college, and probably not with stable income, as well as possible college debt. It's a transition period from college into \"the real world\". Compare that to an almost 50 yr old, who has much more stable finances and has a strong foundation of life. This could lead to holding financial support over his head, or numerous other problems\n\nAlso, I would be uncomfortable if my parent was dating someone younger than me.

If you're not worried about that then I feel like you're perfectly within your right to tell her.\n\nYour delivery was harsh though and is probably what would swing someone's decision over to you being TA.\n\nAt the end of the day your mother's behaviour is unpleasant and a little stomach churning. As such you are free to vocalise that as much as you want.\nJust be aware that this will isolate her and her relationship from you.", "NTA - don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily think there is anything wrong with dating someone younger. My brother's wife was exactly 18 years older than him (so his wife was dating someone 18 years younger than her), and they had a fantastic relationship and marriage, and she had already had kids before they met. But he was older than them (not just by a year, more like 10 plus years older).\n\nThe issue is that he is younger than you. Like a year younger. That's ridiculous. If your mom looks like she is 30 (so looks young for her age), did she even tell him her actual age? I find it weird that she is dating someone younger than you. Not that she is dating someone young.\n\nAsk her why she feels the need to go after young adults? What thrill is it doing for her? Besides sex, what is she getting out of it?

If your mom is having a good time at her age, then let her.  We all end up in the ground and nobody will remember us in 100 years anyhow.

Like, she's EXTREMELY attractive, to the point where I've always been a little worried about introducing boyfriends to her out of fear they'll get smitten with her. For reference, she looks about 15-20 years younger than she is, and would be very attractive for a 30 year old. Anyway, last week I went by her house to pick her up for lunch when I saw this guy about my age leaving. At first I thought he must've been a salesman or something, but the way my mother let him go (with a passionate kiss on the lips) let me know they were involved. After he left, my mom told me that the guy was her boyfriend and that they'd been dating for the last four months, and she told me he was 23. I was shocked, as the guy was literally younger than me and he was dating my mom, and I told her so. We went back and forth about this, as I told her that the guy was too young for her and was probably just out for her money or something, and she countered by telling me to stay out of her love life. Suffice to say we didn't leave on great terms, as I told her to grow up before leaving, and we haven't really spoken since. I think I'm just gonna let this play out until her midlife crisis wears off, and I don't really think I did anything wrong because my mom's relationship is gross to begin with.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Good relationships are built on personalities and compatibility. Age is a secondary characteristic, I don't see why this bothers so many people. Age (within reason) shouldn't determine if you should have someone in your life or not.

(Im gonna use YouTuber Madisyn Brown\u2019s term, \u201cLife Arenas\u201d)\n\nYou go through way more life arenas way faster earlier in life, and it slows down significantly when you reach full adulthood.  Kind of like how there\u2019s a fairly big difference between a 13 and an 18 year old, but not that big a difference between a 33 and 38 year old.  \n\nHealthy relationships form between people in similar life arenas, because they\u2019re on the same level in terms of experiences, priorities, and goals.  Most 18yos have very different goals and priorities than most 30yos, as they\u2019re at different points in their lives with different levels of experience.  However, that\u2019s not *always* the case; sometimes some people grow up faster than others.  Sometimes age gap relationships *can* work, provided both people are in a similar life arena.  Maybe a 24yo has really seen some shit, had to grow up way too fast, and is developmentally much further ahead than their peers.  Maybe that 24yo is in a similar life arena to someone in their late 30s, and they can build a meaningful and healthy relationship.  \n\n25 is the age when your prefrontal cortex is considered to be fully developed.  After that happens, the developmental milestones, understandably, slow a lot.  You\u2019re entering full-fledged adulthood with real adult problems and priorities, like a job and a house and bills and\u2026 you get the picture.  For sure, everyone develops differently, so just because you\u2019re 25 doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re suddenly a fully matured human being who has life nailed down.  But mentally speaking, you\u2019re viewed as an adult.  When you\u2019re 20, can\u2019t even drink yet, were just a teenager 2 seconds ago, you\u2019re kinda seen as *barely* an adult.\n\nIn this specific relationship between OP\u2019s hot 49yo mom and the 23yo boyfriend, it\u2019s possible they\u2019re in similar life arenas and have a healthy, happy relationship.  But generally speaking, 23 is seen as a time when you\u2019re still an immature idiot stumbling around early adulthood trying to put the pieces together.  Without knowing more details than what\u2019s been provided, based off of what\u2019s average for people, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re not.  It\u2019s most likely that both are feeling sexy and validated by scoring with someone who would be considered so out of their league.  \n\nThat turned into a novel, so TL;DR: healthy relationships are about where people are in life.  25 is when your brain is fully developed, which is likely why people get less skeeved about age gaps when someone is 25 over 20.  In the case of OPs mom and her boyfriend, it\u2019s not impossible that they have a healthy relationship, but based on averages it\u2019s most likely they like each other because they\u2019re scoring with someone that\u2019s viewed as \u201cout of their league\u201d.", "Maybe they're not concerned with a long-lasting relationship but are just having fun.
