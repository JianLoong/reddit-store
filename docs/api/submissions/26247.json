I also participated in the workouts with him too though (we didn\u2019t have time to spend 2+ hours in the gym so he could workout and then I could afterwards so we did them back and forth) only some of my weights/reps were higher, or my times were lower. But that\u2019s just me getting in my workout too. And keep in mind. We used to PT together all the time earlier on in our relationship.

I think instead of accusing her of being malicious, we have to recognize that he\u2019s in an extremely sensitive state and he likely is going to take all her actions as belittling him. But there\u2019s nothing objectively wrong with offer the bribes, and I bet he wouldve been happy to receive them back when he was stronger than her", "Okay, but you get that not everyone is exactly like you, right?  OP said that her cheerleading and bedroom bribes were only making him angry.  That is the point when she should have backed off instead of doubling down.", "You might like it but that\u2019s because women are conditioned to think that their sexual offerings have value even in a committed relationship, and men, that they need to \u201cearn\u201d those things, even in a committed relationship. \n\nImagine a man saying \u201cI\u2019ll go down on you tonight if you do better at the gym\u2026\u201d yuck. I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t work for some people, and if it does that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019d see it as incredibly unsexy and transactional, and like he doesn\u2019t actually want to do it. \n\nHow much more nicely would their evening have gone if she\u2019d recognized he felt shitty when confronted with the consequences of his inactivity, and just gave him a few hours to deal with his emotions, then just had sex with him if they both wanted to?", "This is like the 5th post this week about post-childbirth women physically dominating their stereotypical \"tough guy career\" husbands.\n\nIs this someone's fetish or something?", "As a former Marine, you\u2019d better be able to kick the ass of any Air Force officer.

He's probably already extremely insecure about his fitness/appearance, and then he has a super fit wife bribing him like a child with sex so that he'll get into shape.

Of course though, an untrained male saying he\u2019s automatically stronger than a trained female is another story\u2026", "A lot of people invested in obvious truth. BTW you just equated stronger with being better which makes you a disgusting bigot.", "That's a pretty big stretch. Men are born with stronger physical genetics so it can be very emasculating when your wife can beat you up. Why does he have to see her as inferior because of this? Why is that your conclusion? On average, women do have inferior strength, but they are far superior in other ways. It's not seeing someone's totality as inferior. \n\nI'd also assume the type of thoughts swirling in his head considering he has been in the airforce practically his entire professional career. It's probably quite the opposite to what you're saying actually, the one thing god has given him in greater amounts than his counterpart is weak, so perhaps it's his own inferiority that is making him react this way? That's a high level of frustration if you ask me.\n\nThere is nothing toxic with a man wanting to be stronger than a woman and the feeling of inadequacy doesn't make him toxic either. It's when men choose to not protect women with their strength that makes them toxic, when they specifically use that biological advantage to hurt someone else. \n\nIs being masculine just toxic in general in your opinion?", "Lol exactly\u2026 I can\u2019t ever imagine a scenario where me and my wife would have a literal wrestling match\u2026 these people are so weird hahaha. And the women in the comments cheering on the \u201cgirl power\u201d crap would react very differently if the guy had pinned his wife down and refused to let her up as she\u2019s \u201cpanting uncontrollably\u201d. Lol. I think the post is fake and just trolling but everyone seems to be reacting as though it\u2019s real. If it is, these are super weird people", "I accidentally lol\u2019d. Shame on you. ;-)", "Let me say, this \"training program\" is no joke. In the Navy, they had the most hard-ass Marines run a DAILY ass-kicking fitness program. (Mandatory for PT fails, open to anyone who wanted to sweat) I have been to a lot of group fitness classes in the years that have passed, but nothing ever approached the intensity of those guys.", "That's for enlisted. For officers, it's much worse. A PT fail is an automatic LOR, I believe, and an LOR for an officer is an automatic UIF. And that makes you essentially non-promotable which will eventually force you out once you reach the max years you can serve in your respective rank.", "It's the same picture", ">I'm still waiting for the one where the wife and husband wrestle and he beats the fuck out of her while he and the kids laugh at the worthless wife.\n\nYou can see that 7 days a week at your local courthouse.", "Good luck.  I hope he turns his attitude around and realizes that this is his problem, not yours.", "Yeah came here to say something similar\u2026 We Marines are different than the other services, especially the Air Force. Dunno what your hubby was thinking attempting to wrestle someone whose received training in groundfighting, doubly so when out of shape. Good on you for letting him up. \n\nThat said you left out if he had any physical injuries which might make pt painful or otherwise cause him to avoid it. I was in nearly 21 years but years of sucking it up took its toll and I was barely able to walk up/down stairs and missing pieces from my shoulder made pullups very difficult (pre surgery I could do upper 30,s; post surgery I\u2019d be lucky to hit 18). Even if so he\u2019s probably well aware of his shortcomings and knows there are likely repercussions on the horizon. Further, it\u2019s generally considered unofficerlike to let oneself slip out of regs, unlike enlisted folks where the command will get involved to manage pt, nutrition, and whatnot. Further, he might not see an opportunity exists to receive help if he\u2019s in command or in a visible staff billet. This is all to say that his behavior towards you is inexcusable, but may be understandable if he\u2019s cracking a bit due to the situation. He\u2019ll need some help to work through it, but unfortunately it might not be you whose best suited to give it to him. \n\nI wish the best for you and your family as you maneuver through this situation. \n\nSemper Fi.", "You whooped his ass and shamed him on the internet. Good for you! \n\nJust go ahead and leave him, now. You don't respect him. Prove your point and finish him off. \n\nDon't you think you deserve better? \n\nESH.", ">But wanted to low key make an AF joke.\n\nDoes he make sure you know how stupid you are for being an enlisted Marine? Not even commenting on the cliche of enlisteds fucking an officer for the $? Because if we're going to go in on stereotypes, let's do it. \n\nDo you have an actual job? Not counting your MLM I'm sure you're in.", "\u201cIf you do really good at the gym, I\u2019ll go down on you later.\u201d", "Probably, I have problems beating people. But I didn't say that, i just said \"Don't see this this sequence of events happening\"\n\n1. he messes up his training, okay no problem. \n2. He acts childish (or pissed), okay no problem\n3. It turned into one of our bigger arguments we\u2019ve had in years. Okay you can get in a fight about it, but I don't think it's a really big one. \n4. Eventually it got to the point of him explaining how he could still kick 99% of all women\u2019s asses if he wanted... Ehh, who would boast that he could beat a woman, I don't know any man who would say that. \n5. This **naturally** (they are 40 years old, wtf) escalated, **and next thing I knew** (so not agreed upon) we were full on wrestling each other ... So they got into a fight and naturally they both committed domestic violence against each other ?", "I\u2019m saying that she knew her husband was deeply insecure about something, and she chose to embarrass him about it. That\u2019s kinda cruel, even if the man was being stupid himself.\n\nI get that a ton of people on this sub love to see an arrogant, macho man get humbled, but that\u2019s not good advice for how to treat people you\u2019re supposed to love.", "Really? He's a human being who may be dealing with something and could need help. Yeah, so much for leaving no one behind. But I'm curious as to why you're so willing and eager to discard a fellow serviceman. And \"his commander doesn't need to know\" is exactly why issues like this have drastic results. I respect our men and women who choose to serve, but there's no more antiquated organization than the military.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Yep like me I'm tough really tough. I don't know about beating 99 percent of women tough. I'll bet there's an old lady with a walker out there somewhere I can take.", "Salute!  lol", "As a man this was a worthless comment. Who cares what he feels like he deserves? If he wants to feel like he can beat his wife then he should get his ass to that point and earn it. Imagine losing and throwing a tantrum like a 12 year old boy who just got beat by his sister. \u201cIs being masculine just toxic in general\u201d please\u2026 0 masculinity here. I question you if you\u2019re defending him \ud83e\udd28", "No, not even a little.", "*feelings* don't make people toxic, but *actions* do. If he had just felt inadequate and dealt with it internally it would be one thing, but OP's husband became an asshole as soon as he started acting like a giant adult baby over losing. Aside from that, while men may have the upper hand on upper body strength, it's become a common trope that many women outclass men at the gym on leg day. Fighting style, reflexes, and agility can also determine the outcome of a match. Men have better reflexes but women have more agility.", "The fact that you don\u2019t think #4 is common is insane. I assume you\u2019re a man, this is not a rare comment for men to make. Wrestling is not domestic violence if both have consented, which they clearly did. They\u2019re both unfortunately obsessed with physical activity and they\u2019re both in the military, this doesn\u2019t sound odd to me at all. \n\nI think a lot of Reddit posts are fake, but this scenario doesn\u2019t sound shock me whatsoever.", "Wrestling is a consensual event, not domestic violence.", "No idea why you're getting down-voted. That's what I latched onto too. There seemed to he a lot that pushed him to the point of exploding. If roles were reversed and a man was to give his chubby wife bedroom bribes to get in shape, we'd be seeing different responses.", "My girlfriend does Crossfit and is also much stronger than me. I'm 6'6\" and basically twice her size so it's a fairly even match when we wrestle, but I have zero doubts she could take me if things got real. \n\nI knew I was in love when she showed me a video of a challenge at her gym where they had to try to crush a melon between their thighs and she was the only one there who could actually do it. All I could think about the rest of the evening was how I wished the melon was my head.", "\ud83e\udd23 you might get lucky and she will have arthritis", ">The fact that you don\u2019t think #4 is common is insane. I assume you\u2019re a man, this is not a rare comment for men to make.\n\nI don't know in which circles you converse, but I am a man, had therefore probably more contact with them than you and I never heard that. It's like saying im able to beat 99% of children. From my point of view it's more insane to think it's common. But you do you.", "Because they think his one awful comment (which I acknowledged at the start was awful) justifies any unkindness or bad behavior by OP that came before the awful comment.  It\u2019s a bit backwards, but it is what it is.", "She has to put the walker down sometime!!!!. Seriously though I went to tech school with a girl named nalu. We all got stronger but she was fit to start with. Took me a year before I got any stronger than her. Men are typically stronger than women yes. Sedentary men against an active woman better win in the first punch or 4. After that he's her plaything.", "\u201c I am a man, had therefore probably more contact with them than you\u201d\n\nLol this made me laugh, thanks for that. I didn\u2019t say that men that are my friends or family say this to me, but this is very common for men to say. Are you saying it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re stronger than women, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re comparing them to children? \n\nDon't you think men are more likely to say this to women more than men? Therefore, women would know more about this? It\u2019s not healthy or endearing when men say this, it\u2019s abusive. You don\u2019t think abusive men say this? You don\u2019t think men say this to scare women? To put women in \u201ctheir place\u201d? To try and be funny?", "[removed]", "Your right there chief. I've seen a few women put men in their places and rightly so", "People often seem to forget that the men are stronger than women thing is:\n\n 1/ that's on average.

What's the best crayon flavor and why it is green?", "Years ago I did Aikido, one of the instructors was a 5'1 soccer mom, nicest lady, had her black belt, She made it look so easy. A guy in my class was 6'2 and she could toss him around like he was a pillow.", "Yeah to be absolutely fair though. Unless you are confident you can take on a raccoon with rabies and a couple Chihuahua ankle biters at the same time then you shouldn't be fighting anyone more than a foot shorter. Bad for the back not because you have to punch low the damage comes from the size 4 shoe point in your tailbone.\nSource...sore tailbone and the same situation as you just not akkido. I was also blown away by how much stabilizer muscles and the odd muscles we barely think to train make such a difference especially on the ground. I could physically lift her off of me but don't think for a second that means anything if someone is trying to hurt you they wont stop just because you lifted them."]}
