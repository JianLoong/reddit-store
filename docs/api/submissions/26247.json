I see what you\u2019re saying. I should have been more clear in the OP. I wasn\u2019t trying to humble him at all. In fact, I went to just to support him and was going to do my own thing. But he actually asked for me to help time him and stuff. And then I just naturally would end up doing the same stuff as him -just generally with more weight, or for more reps than him. Not to \u201cshow up\u201d just because that\u2019s what I needed to get in a workout of my own. I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time.

I\u2019m sorry. \nIt was much more playful and jokeful. We\u2019ve been married almost 10 years with 2 kids lol.

Thank you for your reply.", "First, I didn\u2019t want to make any AF jokes\u2026but it was all I could do to stop myself haha. \nSecond, so what should I have done? I wanted to try and get his \u201ctraining\u201d started but I was super gentle about it and then dropped it for weeks until he finally decided to start. \nThen I wanted to support him, so I went with him. And on the way there, he asked me to help time him and record his numbers for him. I also participated in the workouts with him too though (we didn\u2019t have time to spend 2+ hours in the gym so he could workout and then I could afterwards so we did them back and forth) only some of my weights/reps were higher, or my times were lower. But that\u2019s just me getting in my workout too. And keep in mind. We used to PT together all the time earlier on in our relationship. Only back then, he would \u201cwin\u201d almost everything. \nAnd once the wrestling thing came up, and he challenged me. What should I have done?\u2026\nThank you for your post.", "Lol, I didn\u2019t. But wanted to low key make an AF joke. \nAnd well I mean, when we met and for the first few years we were married, he was stronger than me even while I was still in. We would PT and even sometimes wrestle around.

You need to acknowledge and then purposefully and consciously address it.", "He said that after she\u2019d already made him feel like shit, not at the outset.

Too many teenagers. As an older American I will say that physical fitness and good nutrition have to come from him. You can't encourage, push, or manipulate him into it. When the kids are older he might come back to it. Or maybe never again.

The easy answer is NTA, but it does seem like OP is kind of enjoying this.", "If my partner mentioned how they could beat up 99% of women, I\u2019d be more than happy to humble him a little. He has a toxic and immature attitude and he needed a reality check", "Meh. I mean I don\u2019t love the statement, but they were in the middle of a huge argument. Two people have to participate for that to happen. What did OP say? He could certainly hold his own insecurities in that regard and if he\u2019d said it in a vacuum it would be an easy NTA, but OP really seems to have pushed this \u201cI\u2019m stronger than my military husband\u201d thing too far, and I\u2019m not ready to assume the comment wasn\u2019t him lashing out after being kicked while he\u2019s down.", "She\u2019d already \u201chumbled\u201d him before he made that comment, which is why they\u2019re both TA.", "Hmm that\u2019s fair. It\u2019s hard to know what made the argument escalate. I pictured him just being mad at her and saying she was demeaning for lifting more than him or insisting that he\u2019s still stronger than her. But we obviously can\u2019t know without both sides. \n\nI empathize with him! My partner recently became better than me at a craft I introduced her to, and it was a MAJOR ego blow LOL. But that lasted only a few seconds before I praised her and told her how proud I was. I think his response is an indicator that he\u2019s a bit immature.  It would be hurtful for someone not to show any congratulations or pride when their partner is hitting new PRs and making amazing progress!", "If he thinks that her being able to lift more than him is humbling, then that\u2019s on him! He knows she has been training hard and he has not been training at all it seems. This is the obvious outcome, so it\u2019s unfair to act like she was malicious for doing her typical workout", "Haha last night my partner and I were playing a game (he\u2019s the gamer), I did better than he did four times in a row and he said \u201cI think you\u2019re better at this than me\u2026\u201d I said \u201cI think I just got lucky!\u201d\n\nBut yeah about this post, I just don\u2019t know\u2026 I really can\u2019t and don\u2019t approve the statement, but OP cherry-picked ONE thing he said in the middle of a big argument to be like \u201clook, isn\u2019t my husband both pathetically weak AND a misogynist?\u201d", "As I have already explained, the \u201cbedroom bribes\u201d that came before it were demeaning.", "Hey, if my girlfriend gave me bedroom bribes to motivate me in the gym I would LOVE it. I think instead of accusing her of being malicious, we have to recognize that he\u2019s in an extremely sensitive state and he likely is going to take all her actions as belittling him. But there\u2019s nothing objectively wrong with offer the bribes, and I bet he wouldve been happy to receive them back when he was stronger than her", "Okay, but you get that not everyone is exactly like you, right?  OP said that her cheerleading and bedroom bribes were only making him angry.  That is the point when she should have backed off instead of doubling down.", "You might like it but that\u2019s because women are conditioned to think that their sexual offerings have value even in a committed relationship, and men, that they need to \u201cearn\u201d those things, even in a committed relationship. \n\nImagine a man saying \u201cI\u2019ll go down on you tonight if you do better at the gym\u2026\u201d yuck. I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t work for some people, and if it does that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019d see it as incredibly unsexy and transactional, and like he doesn\u2019t actually want to do it. \n\nHow much more nicely would their evening have gone if she\u2019d recognized he felt shitty when confronted with the consequences of his inactivity, and just gave him a few hours to deal with his emotions, then just had sex with him if they both wanted to?"]}
