And on the way there, he asked me to help time him and record his numbers for him. I also participated in the workouts with him too though (we didn\u2019t have time to spend 2+ hours in the gym so he could workout and then I could afterwards so we did them back and forth) only some of my weights/reps were higher, or my times were lower. But that\u2019s just me getting in my workout too. And keep in mind. We used to PT together all the time earlier on in our relationship.

Too many teenagers. As an older American I will say that physical fitness and good nutrition have to come from him. You can't encourage, push, or manipulate him into it.

He knows she has been training hard and he has not been training at all it seems.

I think instead of accusing her of being malicious, we have to recognize that he\u2019s in an extremely sensitive state and he likely is going to take all her actions as belittling him. But there\u2019s nothing objectively wrong with offer the bribes, and I bet he wouldve been happy to receive them back when he was stronger than her", "Okay, but you get that not everyone is exactly like you, right?  OP said that her cheerleading and bedroom bribes were only making him angry.  That is the point when she should have backed off instead of doubling down.", "You might like it but that\u2019s because women are conditioned to think that their sexual offerings have value even in a committed relationship, and men, that they need to \u201cearn\u201d those things, even in a committed relationship. \n\nImagine a man saying \u201cI\u2019ll go down on you tonight if you do better at the gym\u2026\u201d yuck. I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t work for some people, and if it does that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019d see it as incredibly unsexy and transactional, and like he doesn\u2019t actually want to do it. \n\nHow much more nicely would their evening have gone if she\u2019d recognized he felt shitty when confronted with the consequences of his inactivity, and just gave him a few hours to deal with his emotions, then just had sex with him if they both wanted to?", "This is like the 5th post this week about post-childbirth women physically dominating their stereotypical \"tough guy career\" husbands.\n\nIs this someone's fetish or something?", "As a former Marine, you\u2019d better be able to kick the ass of any Air Force officer.

He's probably already extremely insecure about his fitness/appearance, and then he has a super fit wife bribing him like a child with sex so that he'll get into shape.

Prove your point and finish him off.\n\n\nI'm guessing you imagined your ex wife while saying this?", "Is this a /s or what?... She has a job, she's a Marine lmao. \n\nShe'd be justified in making an AF joke here too since her husband let himself go. If she bought a Camaro at 34% APR or some shit then he could make fun of her for being stupid. But I don't see what in her post would warrant crayon eater jokes or the money thing. And why the MLM vitriol?", "And this is why the whole \"what if we reversed genders\" makes arguments nonsensical. You don't get to ignore all societal and gender norms and just say \"what if we reversed this one tiny thing\" and think you're making a point.", "because three different persons can't possible have the same situation? for sure", "I agree the writing style is very similar to the other post I read.  Same stuff about wrestling with their spouse.", "It's not a worthless comment, I am not taking away that he acted like a complete asshat, I just don't think that the word \"toxic masculinity\" should be thrown around like this. He was humiliated and let his emotions get the better of him, but haven't we all? Is this only something reserved for men? I've seen many women act horribly after getting humiliated, should I then call it toxic femininity? No cos that word doesn't even fucking exist apparently. \n\nStop turning it into something it isn't. Let it be exactly what it is, him being an idiot, nothing more nothing less.", "Right but what I'm saying is that acting in the way he did is not something specifically only men do. Why do we call it \"toxic masculinity\"? I know many women who also act this way but we don't label in \"toxic femininity\". The feeling of humiliation is probably one of the worst ones that humans go through, so it doesn't surprise me that he acted in a way that would show how upset he was about the situation. \n\nCan we just admit that the guy acted like an ass? What does that have to do with being a man? Is that a right only reserved for men? Are women perfect structures that couldn't stoop down to this level? Stop kidding yourself. Stop blaming it on the persons sex or gender. The guy was horribly humiliated, and he is certainly the asshole for his response to that. But can we find some compassion? The guy is human, we make mistakes all the time, and this was clearly something he was struggling with internally, and perhaps for a while. \n\nThere are always two sides of the coin that some people are not willing to explore.\n\nCan we stop calling this ma", "Oh I don\u2019t think he isn\u2019t also an AH. \n\nI just think OP is an AH and folks are so excited that she won the physical match that they aren\u2019t recognizing her obnoxiousness", "Wait so you\u2019re saying that violence against women is ok so long as the woman makes a braggadocious comment beforehand??? \n\nAlso, guarantee this is a fake post\n\nLastly, have you *ever* been in a situation where you had legit wrestling match with your spouse?! It\u2019s so fricken weird lol", "LOR = Letter of Reprimand \n\nBasically a letter that documents what you did and why it violated standards/rules/laws that military members are required to follow\n\nUIF = Unfavorable Information File\n\nA file that follows you around that is more serious than an LOR on its own. It is accompanied by a code on your profile that, depending on the exact code, can restrict your ability to move to another base/assignment in addition to other things. UIFs are also often accompanied by some form of demotion or promotion denial and sometimes contribute to an administrative discharge or even a court martial depending on the situation", "Had. You don't actually think someone fucking an officer would stay enlisted, right?\n\n\"enlisted in the Marine Corps for 8 years before we began to have our children\"\n\n>And why the MLM vitriol?\n\nI mean it's the cliche. Military spouses don't want to get a real job but do MLMs instead. Is that really news to you?\n\n>or the money thing.\n\nAgain. This is super common. As common as getting married for BAH. Enlisteds don't get paid shit, so they get married for $ or fuck officers.\n\nAnd trust me, I've seen plenty of fat Marines when I was enlisted, and I've seen women use almost the max amount of time on their 3 mile run.

It's frightening that so many people are overlooking that. And looking at an argument from different points of views is actually a good thing.

He got beaten in a wrestling match by his wife and then tried to re-inflate his fragile ego by claiming he could beat up 99% of women. He threw a tantrum and ran away, that\u2019s fragile and toxic. It has everything to do with being a man by HIM bringing gender into it and claiming he can beat up women.\n\nEdit: he\u2019s ALSO too fragile to admit his wife now is more fit and knows more about it than him and doesn\u2019t see her as an equal but actually a competitor. He tried to prove he was better and got humbled real quick, threw a tantrum and now is taking it out on other women by claiming he can beat them up. That, is toxic.", "I think military types are kinda like that more often then the average person, but I do agree that it\u2019s a little ridiculous.
