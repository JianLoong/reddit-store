I won't go into details but it was not an easy read and if I could unread it I would but what's done is done. \n\nI know for a fact our Mum will end up wanting to read the diaries too but I know that some of the things written on those pages will devastate her, especially knowing she'd been clueless to this struggle.

We had discussed the \"just in case\" at one point, I was under strict orders to dispose of all of her sex stuff, all her journals, and any computer tech that would affect the legacy she left behind for others. I have no doubt that your sister would not want her mother to know the darkest depths her mind reached in her final days. \n\nIf I can give you a piece of heartfelt advice -  think of what *she* would have wanted  rather than what is \"right\" or \"wrong.\" I have buried a lot of loved ones in the last 5 years and time and time again I have only been able to be at peace with my grief by asking myself, if they were here, standing beside me, what would they feel? How would they react? And trying to respect what I feel they would have wanted, regardless of whether it was what *I* would have preferred.", "Hey man, sorry for your loss. And, sorry you're already getting hated on for reading the diaries in the first place. It sounds like an awful situation, and I wouldn't take anyone's opinions too seriously here.

There\u2019s no good reason to open up even more wounds when your parents are already grieving.

Give yourself some time to distance emotionally from it. These are her last words & even the hard ones are a memory of her. \n\nMy mom kept the journals of her brother that he probably wouldn't have wanted his family to see - a closeted gay man who died of AIDS in the 80s. But 20-30 years later, reading those was so, so meaningful. I know it's not the same situation but the point I want to make is that you shouldn't erase it because it's painful in the moment. It may be too hard to read now but in 10 years it may provide a lot of meaning and closure.", "Diaries are intended to be a release for the writer. They are not meant for others to read.

I doubt your sister ever meant for your mother to read those words. She maybe should have said not to read them or gotten rid of them herself, but she wasn't in a place to do it or maybe she just assumed you would of course never read them so she didn't think of it at all.

Some of those feelings are going to be ugly. But they don\u2019t need to be shared. It\u2019s possible she\u2019d never have felt that way if she wasn\u2019t sick, or that she\u2019d have worked through it if she\u2019d had more time.

But no, you cannot destroy them. They are your sister's legacy, and you are not the only one entitled to read them and it is not your prerogative to censor them.", "No don't. Your mother deserves to know. No matter what, it's the thoughts of your sister, her daughter. Soft YTA if you do it.", "YTA. As someone who writes journals, I do it to clear my head but also in hopes that someone will find them when I'm gone and let my memories and stories live on after I'm gone.

Maybe later, despite the pain they give you now, you might want to read them again. But the others, the ones from before the cancer, make a big show of having found them \"buried\" in her wardrobe, share the good times and the humour. Keep the others to yourself. When/if questioned, deny everything. Make their memories of her pleasant, not tainted with the prospect of her imminent death and how she felt.", "NTA if you destroy the later diaries.\n\n\nAnd, thank you for the reminder: I need to locate and destroy my (extremely dull) teenage diaries.", "I agree with the suggestion to put them away for now. Revisit them when you are not in the midst of heavy grief. Then decide if your mom should see them. It sounds like there are things in them that will make your Mom feel worse than she already does.", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve suffered such a significant loss. I am against destroying them as somehow it seems very final but I think you should keep them away from your mother and other family. You\u2019re right they don\u2019t need that hurt.", "NTA if you destroy them but, I think it\u2019s pretty awful you read her diaries in the first place. Those were private and for her.

Let your sister rest in peace.", "NAH.\n\nI understand your reasoning but these are some of the last new pieces of information your mom will ever have about her daughter.\n\nI would instead warn her, and remind her that your sister was in a ton of pain and on a ton of medication. Not enough is mentioned about how cancer changes someone\u2019s personality. Your sister was also working through something unfathomable to most people - better to work through that on the page than through loved ones.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to make this decision for your mother.

I agree with others that it's not up to you to destroy it to protect your mom/family. If you did that, you would choose for her. (And destroying is permanent) it is not your place or your right. \n\nThis may be a strange advice, but if you want to protect your mom/family, you could also consider telling her/them that you ended up reading them, and really wished you hadn't. That way she will not be surprised if she does decide to read it, and she will be warned and she will have the opportunity to make her own conscious decision whether to read or not.\n\nEither way, I would definitely not destroy or withhold the earlier diaries.

I can only imagine how hard this has all been for you. Secondly, I absolutely understand why you would want to save your family from anymore pain. My advice though, is keep them safe, but don't give them to your mother. They are still your sister's legacy, her thoughts and feelings during a dark time, and they will help you and other family members know and understand her, when the pain has eased (not your parents but perhaps your children, or cousins). As painful as it is, it's all part of her life, the good and the bad. \n\nBut, whatever you chose to do, your choice is made out of love and so you are most definitely NOT an asshole.", "NAH\n\nThis is going to be a topic with varied opinions!\n\nPersonally I don't think it's your place to make a decision like that (at least without telling mom/dad what the general diary content is and seeing if they'd be okay not reading the difficult one).

They have a perception of how to view their child now already... they dont have to know it's any different if it isn't going to change anything, especially if it's just going to add even more pain to losing her. Those were meant to be her private thoughts, and if she didn't share them when she was alive, then I doubt even in death would she. The diarys were her safe space to vent and make sense of the things she felt, so she didn't have to say them and hurt anyone. If you must keep them, store them somewhere with the intent of never looking at them again, and only if it becomes a necessity should you ever even consider bringing them to light.", "NTA at all\n\nLook, you\u2019ve been through a major trauma and there\u2019s really no way to determine what the right thing to do is.

I am a psychotherapist and often recommend the destruction of journal entries shortly after they are written. It may not even be beneficial to the author to re read them in some cases. The later diaries you discussed don\u2019t sound like memoirs to be shared in the way you described them. I would take some time and try to connect with your intuition on what your sister would want you to do with them.", "NAH those diaries weren\u2019t intended for her family to read.

Then in a few years, you can share them with your parents if they want to know about it.  \n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to protect your sisters memory and your parents feelings but destroying the diaries might be seen as a betrayal by your parents too.  There is sadly no easy right or wrong answer here.  I hope you keep them but understand why you might not", "Yes this. Don't do anything when everything is still so fresh.

Also, you could always destroy them later.", "NAH I feel like doing anything other than destroying them is a violation of your sister\u2019s privacy.", "I agree with the pack them up and wait a year sentiment I've seen expressed multiple times. \n\nI have a suggestion though, if after the year is over you are still thinking about destroying some of them, consider donating them to an archive, instead. When donating something like this, you can put a stipulation that they cannot be read/ part of the accessible collection for 50 or 100 years (whatever time you feel like is enough that anyone likely to feel hurt is gone.) \n\nWhy would you do this? Well, this is something your sister poured her heart and soul into, and preserving and protecting them provides a sort of immortality. \n\nWhy would an archive want them. These would provide an invaluable resource to future researchers / historians, giving a unique window into what life was like. I could see some far future student getting a whole thesis out of this first person resource writing about the difficulties of medical treatment in our time. \n\nJust a thought, so you don't have to feel guilt for destroying them, but they're also not laying around for your mom to potential find and be hurt by.", "I would destroy the ones with bad things in them  It doesn\u2019t really help the memory of your sister. It just pollutes them at this point. She has no way to defend herself. Do keep the ones with the good memories in them. NTA", "NTA. Diaries should be private.", "Destroy the harmful diaries, it does not one any good to read something that can't be changed.\n\nShe's gone, your parents messed up and cant fix what was done.\n\nAnd neither can you.\n\nLet it rest.", "I really hope this makes it to the very top. This is the best advice yet.", "Exactly. It's the THOUGHTS of someone else. They shouldn't be fodder for anyone else.", "Wait a bit and then give it some thought. If it will do more harm then good then it might be be best to get rid of it. This could be one of those situations where what they don't know can't hurt them is a good idea.", "YWBTA (please correct me if that's wrong) if you gave the later diaries to your mom she's already suffering from one of the worst things that can happen to someone losing a child your already suffering from guilt when you didn't even do anything don't do this to your mom get rid of the later ones and share her child/teen ones your mom doesn't need to know that your sister felt this way she didn't tell you for a reason I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sorry that you discovered the dark thoughts your sister had I wish you all the luck in the world", "NAH. My immediate thought would be to tear out the really hurtful pages, and either destroy them, or pack them elsewhere. The memories ARE worth preserving as a memento mori, and I wouldn't want to lose something like that if I was in your shoes.  \n\n\nIf your mother does read the positive/less incendiary parts, and comments on the lost pages (because I doubt they can be removed without being noticeable), you can lie to her that they were pulled out when you found them.", "NAH I don\u2019t think you should destroy the diaries because you\u2019ll probably regret doing so. You should keep the diaries for yourself, only read the good parts, and relive all the fond memories you have of your sister.", "NAH\n\nI wouldn\u2019t do this impulsively though. Box them up and put them in storage and don\u2019t tell anyone.\n\nI especially think the teenage and childhood diaries might be valuable momentos for you or other family members, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to be destroyed hastily in this emotional moment. Don\u2019t make irreversible decisions now.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know how, but you need to find some people who can help share the burden of what you know, and that may include some people who knew your sister. I\u2019m very worried for your mental health carrying this terrible secret that separates you in your grief from the rest of your family.", "If that\u2019s what you think your sister would want then do it.", "Maybe just don't let anyone read the diaries...she never wanted them to be read those were supposed to be her private escape...idk", "NAH. Sounds like you found examples of a therapeutic writing technique that's promoted by many self help books and therapists. This is where you purposely write resentments and other negative emotions from experiences with others, focusing on the worst thoughts, emotions and memories you have as a way to purge them. This is a popular technique particularly in some pain and cancer treatments and many self help books for helping heal physical conditions by unearthing negative emotions that have been repressed, often from childhood or intimate relationships (especially family). THESE WRITINGS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE READ BY OTHERS ESPECIALLY FAMILY MEMBERS as they are an emotional processing technique through writing that explicitly describes negative emotions, memories and situations to integrate and express those emotions so they aren't repressed and continuing to affect the physical symptoms. Sounds like you found a bunch of entries like that. You were never meant to read them, they are usually suggested to be destroyed but people often don't for various reasons, for me I don't throw them out or delete them because they often help provide insight and growth later though I would be horrified if anyone who was mentioned read them, so I use code names that only I know who is meant just in case (but it would still be pretty obvious lol) reading this kind of writing and applying it out of context like this isn't fair to her memory (she can't defend herself or clarify anything which she shouldn't need to because they weren't letters to be read), and *negative emotions are healthy to express in that way* (if they aren't expressed, they can eventually cause physical pain or disease). Anyway so sorry for your loss and I hope this helps!", "Thank you. I was so disconcerted by the first answers to \u201ckeep it for later\u201c .

Respect that.", "I have asked my daughter to destroy my diaries unread after I die if I have not already done so. A diary is a private place to vent in safety for most people.", "dont destroy anything yo\n\nrule of thumb- dont make decisions that you cant take back without a very calm head and lots of thought.", "I'm so sorry about you losing your sister.  But please do not make any big decisions while grieving.  That's something I learned in therapy. Don't get rid of personal things you can't retrieve, don't quit a job, don't decide to move cross-country, don't get a tattoo or anything else permanent.  \n\nPlease box up the journals in question and stick them at the back of a closet or somewhere out of sight.  It's better to have them than to kick yourself forever for having gotten rid of them.  Nothing says you'll have to tell your parents about those, in fact, it would be a kindness to not mention them until y'all can talk about your sister without that feeling of getting stabbed.  But you, personally, may want to reread them in a few years, even if you still don't want to show your mother.", "Don't destroy them. Pack them up and put them away. It's something you should all revisit eventually. The pain and grief is raw right now, but it will get easier with time. I think it would be wrong to destroy her words, even if they are unsettling. \n\nVery, very different from this, but I have a diary for my daughters. I have memory issues so I wrote down our day to day activities. I also include my mental issues. Things I'm struggling with. That includes them. My youngest is still an infant, but I have a 4 year old who makes life hard sometimes. I decided not to sugar coat anything for them. It's something they will have to look back on and read when I'm gone. And even if there are sad things in there, at least it's still my words. My true feelings. \n\nIt may not seem like it now, but eventually, you'll appreciate her words. They will tell you how she was feeling in her last moments. Good or bad, I think that's a beautiful thing\n\nEdit: I forgot to say, NTA. You're emotions are crazy right now. But even if you destroy them, I don't think that would make you TA. Just make sure that's what you really want to do. \n\nI truly wish you and your family the best, and I'm so sorry for your loss", "YWNBTA, destroy the later ones. I have no doubt that she would want that.", "My wife has lost her whole family. When her brother passed away, their aunt told my wife not to read his diary. I read it because she asked me too in her stead and I told her to not read it. Everyone has their own story. I have found that many people will remember an event differently. Many stories need to die.", "NTA - Your sister wrote in those diaries for herself to let out emotion during a hard time. I\u2019d doubt that she would want to be remembered by what is in those books.", "NAH.  \nI am sorry for your loss OP, truly sorry.  \nI would very strongly suggest that you pop those diaries after, say, the teen years in a box to store safely for now.  In the midst of your family\u2019s recent raw grief, it would be best to not make a decision right now.   \n In time, it may very well be a way to better understand your sister\u2019s fear & feelings with her own mortality in that time of her life & the relationships during it - and that may help you all understand her feelings better when you are all more open to it -  but I personally would leave it for later on when the initial mourning/grief period is over VS destroying those.    \nYou can never get those true thoughts back - she isn\u2019t here to have the conversation with obviously, but with time those written thoughts may help you all to heal and come to terms with her thoughts and processes during that time of her life xx", "NTA. Maybe save some good bits. My dad died almost a year ago. I got his stuff and most of his diaries were mundane. What he ate, talking to mom and me, etc. I kept the page about the car accident my husband and I had (drunk pulled out in front of us, totaling our vehicle). And how he worried about it and how we were doing. \n\nReally it's up to you. I'd not share them if you know they'll hurt someone else and sorry it's such a what to do situation.", "NTA \nbox them up and keep them away for now \nI think destroying them is rash but those are raw private thoughts from a dark time from a person who was in a hard and scary place\nI\u2019m assuming to the end your sister loved all of you and she would\u2019ve never wanted those thoughts to come out at this time \nYou take everything said when it\u2019s coming from someone in a dark place with a grain of salt, the emotions are too high right now to take it with a grain of salt \nyou are protecting your sisters loving memory and letting your mother grieve in the healthiest way", "I know it\u2019s uncomfortable, but my twin sister has been gone from SUDEP FOR 5 years now. She used to write a diary as well. Even the words that were hard to read, I was so grateful for because the diary is where she felt safe and free.
