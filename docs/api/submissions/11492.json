I graduated from pharmacy school with minimal debt and bought my first rental property. I currently own 4 rental properties with my fianc\u00e9. We both learned how to remodel and fix basic things to keep costs low. We use the rental property money to invest in stocks and looking into buying a 5th property. \n\nMy best friend (32F) of 15 years has been married to her husband for 3 years and they have 1 child and 1 on the way. Their landlord has decided to evict them. He has given them 60 days to find a new place. They have asked if they could live in one of my rental properties.\n\nThe problem is they are not very clean people and that is one of the main reasons for their eviction. My friend has 4 cats and they pee EVERYWHERE. On their clothes, sofa and beds. They also tend to scratch the walls and  cabinets. She just says it\u2019s just because they\u2019re a*holes. Their current home is on the brink of being on a hoarders episode. Her husband spends his free time playing video games and does not try to help in cleaning or doing any \u201cwoman\u201d chores. \n\nMy friend has also asked if we could give her a discount on the rent since they are about to have their 2nd baby.  Both of them work but my friend\u2019s job  will not pay her the whole time she is on maternity leave. \n\nI told her I could give her a temporary reduction on the rent but she would not be allowed to have the cats. She said they are like her children and could not get rid of them. She said that would be like asking to get rid of her human children and I am the a*hole for even suggesting it. I told her those were my stipulations. I have been fortunate that my tenants with pets are respectful and clean up religiously after them. \n\nShe currently is not talking to me and telling our other friends that it\u2019s my fault she is about homeless. A couple of friends have said I should make an exception but  I\u2019ve put so much time and money into these homes. So am I the asshole for telling my friend she can\u2019t move in with her cats?", "created_utc": 1677975414, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ihyy1/aita_for_refusing_to_rent_to_my_pregnant_friend/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't. I don't know how you've remained friends. I could not.\n\nTell her they are all occupied. If she presses the issue, I would have to go broken record, gray rock, then no contact.", "NTA\n\nThey're horrible pet owners. My cat is an ahole, but he uses his litter box appropriately and generally behaves. His asshole nature comes in his interactions with people.\n\nNot only are they horrible pet owners, but they have no respect for anything, even themselves, esp their children if they plan to raise their human children in the filth their furry children leave behind.\n\nIt sounds like your friendship is over, unfortunately, if they value you as a friend for only what you can do for them, and that's a transactional relationship, not a friendship.\n\nIt's up to you if you explain your reasons to your in common friends but you are in no way TA here.", "Oh my lord ***do not do this*** - she is preparing to take advantage of you and this would certainly end the friendship, whatever friendship there was, if it isn't already clearly over by her somehow making her wrecking her apartment and getting evicted your fault.  The r/landlord sub is ***full*** of nightmare stories of renting to \"friends\" who stop paying, wreck places, etc., and based on your story I would bet my own money you would live to severely regret renting to this person.  NTA x1000.", "NTA, she\u2019s being evicted due to destroying the house she currently lives in, she isn\u2019t clean AND she is demanding a reduction in rent?  You know renting to her will end badly.  So lose a friend now, or lose her later after she has destroyed your house and stuck you with $$$$ in damages.  You made the right choice.", "NTA. They've shown you your own property's future, and they have no plans to change. Also, once they get in they will always be late with/not pay the rent and expect you to put up with it for friendship's sake. Do you really want to go through the hell of evicting them? Better to piss them off now and just refuse them outright.", "NTA. DO NOT make an exception. \n\nWhen people show you who they are, believe them the first time. \n\nThey have shown you how they treat other people\u2019s property. And since they know you, they are likely to treat your property even worse. They also strike me as the kind of people who would be very difficult to evict and would try to call your bluff when you tried to kick them out, thinking that they could just go on social media again and pressure you into doing what they want. Do you not fall for it. Stand your ground, and avoid this headache.", "NTA.  If you did rent to her, the friendship would just end the same way anyway, but with your property and financial security destroyed as well.", "NTA  as someone who flips foreclosures absolutely not. Your friends that are saying you should make an exception have no idea how much damage the cats and your \"friend\" can do. The home we currently live in we bought at 25% market value because the previous owner had to evict a tenant like her and the home wasn't rentable or sellable. And what kind of friend goes around badmouthing like that? You gave her the terms you were willing to rent under and she rejected them, if your friends say anything to you tell them the truth. I doubt they would let her stay with them either.", "NTA.\n\nYou already know that these people will cause your apartment to fall into disorder and disrepair. Don't sign up for that problem.", "NTA. Friendship is over tho. Just end it now before she moves into and ruins one of your homes.", "NTA. The friendship would\u2019ve ended no matter what once she asked the question. She was looking to take advantage of your friendship which tells you how much your friendship really meant to her. \n\nYou made the right call. I don\u2019t recommend renting to her at all - even if she gets rid of the cats. The apartment will be trashed regardless.", "NTA,  but don't let her move in at all. There is a reason she is being evicted.  She isn't a good tenant. She is already asking you to discount rent and she hasn't moved in yet. Do you really think it won't get worse once she moves in.", "NTA. It\u2019s a good policy to never mix friends and business. It never turns out well.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to rent to a friend and reduce your rates. Period.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t let her move in without the cats either.", "Definitely NTA.  She and her husband will destroy your rental property with their filthiness.  Real friends also don\u2019t ask for discounts.  Any common friends that agree with her crap can house her and her family until they find a new place to live.  Do NOT rent to her!!!", "NTA. Don\u2019t listen to people who have zero stake in your property. It\u2019s easy for people to talk because if anything happens, it\u2019s not affecting them. \n\nIf you do rent to her, it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll have to evict them too and it\u2019ll damage your relationship even further, plus it\u2019ll take a financial and emotional toll on you. \n\nSave yourself the stress.", "NTA but your mutual friends are. Ask if they're willing to house the cats. And wait for silence to descend.", "NTA..\n\nHonestly she's the asshole for trying to make you the bad person here, she's the reason she is homeless it's not your fault.\n\nPlus you have to evict one of your current tenets to move them in, which is also a. Shitty thing to do.", "NTA. Your only mistake was agreeing to rent to her in the first place, but I know you were trying to help. I have 4 asshole cats as well, guess where they pee? Their boxes. Plus, it sounds like there were other issues, and your house will just be the next one to be a hoarders episode and you\u2019ll end up having to evict her, and feel even more guilty.", "NTA! I have a few cats, they all use the litter box and none of them scratch the walls!!! Like wtf!! They are terrible tenants and terrible pet owners. Them being evicted is why they are about to be homeless, that has nothing to do with you. Don\u2019t rent to them, even if they do re-home the cats! The place will get destroyed!", "NTA, it sounds like they are not good pet owners or respectful renters.", "Think of it a different way. Do your tenants deserve to have people move in that you know will wreck their place and let their cats pee everywhere? Do they deserve the smell and the bugs this will bring? I can pretty much promise you a cat will escape and pee in the hallway. You will need up having to evict them anyway, probably losing tenants in the process, thousands of dollars of damage, and you'll lose that friend anyway. \n\nIf the cats are peeing everywhere, they're not cleaning the litter box, don't have enough litter boxes, the cats are sick, and/or not spayed or neutered. They're bad pet owners.", "Make an exception and rent to people who 1) are.dirty and 2) must keep their animals against your wishes?  Not a chance.  And not talking to you because you made a decision other than the one she wanted to hear?  You need new friends.  NTA.", "NTA. This is why landlords want references. Nonpayment isn't the only reason someone can be evicted....with failure to keep the property reasonably clean and in good upkeep being nearly on par with nonpayment. \n\nYou are within your right not to allow pets. Many rentals dont...usually because they have had to pay for tens of thousands of dollars to repair the damage from pets....urine soaked floors, urine soaked drywall, scratched and chewed walls, dug up yards etc. \n\nPlus cat urine is PUTRID. It is NOT safe for a newborn to be in a house full of ammonia.", "NTA. You know how she lives - she is not a good tenant.", "NTA hold on to those boundaries", "NTA!\nHonestly I would not rent to them, even if they give away their cats. You\u2019ve seen their home, are you sure you\u2019re going to be ok seeing your rental property all dirty and damaged?! Also because she\u2019s your friend she will most likely not want to pay full rent amount, and also have an excuse for it every time. \nAsk those friends if they\u2019ve been to her home, and if they would be ok with cat piss everywhere in their home. I have an issue with cat owners that let their cat be on top of kitchen counters, and dinner table.", "NTA. And it doesn\u2019t sound like a safe environment for children.", "NTA", "NTA at all. She\u2019ll destroy that place just like she did the last place. And more then likely she\u2019ll use your friendship to get out of paying rent. We lost a rental property because my husband (at the time) let his friends rent it. Every month it was something. Oh boo boo if we pay the rent we can\u2019t afford groceries for the kids. Boo boo if we pay the rent instead of the gas bill our heat will get shut off. And he let them slide on it over and over. Got so behind on the mortgage it ended up being foreclosed. Turned out they were really just putting the money aside every month to save up to buy their own house (do I sound a little bitter?). So don\u2019t feel guilty about saying no. You have to think of your own family first.", "Yikes, do not rent to them! NTA", "NTA those friends who think you should make an exception should offer them a place to stay", "NTA .. You did make an offer.  It just had one stipulation - no pets.  Totally reasonable.  I'm guessing the friends telling you that you're heartless or whatever aren't jumping to help take the family and pissing cats in either.", "NTA, she is not getting evicted because of you. That's all on them. She has time to find another place.", "NTA. \nI\u2019m a landlord and would never in a million years rent to people like that. They will ruin your property and you will never recoup from the stress / drama and property damage they will cause. I\u2019ve had this experience, please save yourself the headache do not rent to people that live like that. Be honest with your friend in the best way possible, but shit will hit the fan no matter what and sounds like it already started.", "You\u2019re the property owner, not me. But I doubt you could get away with allowing some tenants to have cats and others to not have them. Also, don\u2019t mention the pregnancy thing.

And evictions are only one part of that equation. That is why prospective landlords almost always call your previous landlords. If they get told that they lived in absolute squalor and caused thousands of dollars worth of damage, had uncontrollable pets and wrecked the place, they are well within their rights to not rent to them. Full...stop. It is NOT discrimination. \n\nYou can absolutely stipulate no pets in one property but allow them in other properties.

It's theirs. They are the ones who will have to pay to make the repairs and cleaning to make the property habitabital again. \n\nThat OPs friend is pregnant is trivial in this situation.\n\nEdit to add: A landlord can also refuse to rent for poor credit, spotty employment history, recent criminal charges, or if the renters income is insufficient.

If the rent exceeds a third of your income, you won't usually qualify because it is unlikely you will be able to keep up with utilities and other expenses.", "We have eight cats, until recently, nine, and we do not have this problem.
