I graduated from pharmacy school with minimal debt and bought my first rental property. I currently own 4 rental properties with my fianc\u00e9. We both learned how to remodel and fix basic things to keep costs low. We use the rental property money to invest in stocks and looking into buying a 5th property. \n\nMy best friend (32F) of 15 years has been married to her husband for 3 years and they have 1 child and 1 on the way. Their landlord has decided to evict them. He has given them 60 days to find a new place. They have asked if they could live in one of my rental properties.\n\nThe problem is they are not very clean people and that is one of the main reasons for their eviction. My friend has 4 cats and they pee EVERYWHERE. On their clothes, sofa and beds. They also tend to scratch the walls and  cabinets. She just says it\u2019s just because they\u2019re a*holes. Their current home is on the brink of being on a hoarders episode. Her husband spends his free time playing video games and does not try to help in cleaning or doing any \u201cwoman\u201d chores. \n\nMy friend has also asked if we could give her a discount on the rent since they are about to have their 2nd baby.  Both of them work but my friend\u2019s job  will not pay her the whole time she is on maternity leave. \n\nI told her I could give her a temporary reduction on the rent but she would not be allowed to have the cats. She said they are like her children and could not get rid of them. She said that would be like asking to get rid of her human children and I am the a*hole for even suggesting it. I told her those were my stipulations. I have been fortunate that my tenants with pets are respectful and clean up religiously after them. \n\nShe currently is not talking to me and telling our other friends that it\u2019s my fault she is about homeless. A couple of friends have said I should make an exception but  I\u2019ve put so much time and money into these homes. So am I the asshole for telling my friend she can\u2019t move in with her cats?", "created_utc": 1677975414, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ihyy1/aita_for_refusing_to_rent_to_my_pregnant_friend/", "score": 1210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nonpayment isn't the only reason someone can be evicted....with failure to keep the property reasonably clean and in good upkeep being nearly on par with nonpayment. \n\nYou are within your right not to allow pets. Many rentals dont...usually because they have had to pay for tens of thousands of dollars to repair the damage from pets....urine soaked floors, urine soaked drywall, scratched and chewed walls, dug up yards etc. \n\nPlus cat urine is PUTRID.

You\u2019ve seen their home, are you sure you\u2019re going to be ok seeing your rental property all dirty and damaged?! Also because she\u2019s your friend she will most likely not want to pay full rent amount, and also have an excuse for it every time. \nAsk those friends if they\u2019ve been to her home, and if they would be ok with cat piss everywhere in their home.

She\u2019ll destroy that place just like she did the last place. And more then likely she\u2019ll use your friendship to get out of paying rent. We lost a rental property because my husband (at the time) let his friends rent it. Every month it was something. Oh boo boo if we pay the rent we can\u2019t afford groceries for the kids. Boo boo if we pay the rent instead of the gas bill our heat will get shut off. And he let them slide on it over and over. Got so behind on the mortgage it ended up being foreclosed. Turned out they were really just putting the money aside every month to save up to buy their own house (do I sound a little bitter?). So don\u2019t feel guilty about saying no. You have to think of your own family first.", "Yikes, do not rent to them! NTA", "NTA those friends who think you should make an exception should offer them a place to stay", "NTA .. You did make an offer.  It just had one stipulation - no pets.  Totally reasonable.  I'm guessing the friends telling you that you're heartless or whatever aren't jumping to help take the family and pissing cats in either.", "NTA, she is not getting evicted because of you. That's all on them. She has time to find another place.", "NTA. \nI\u2019m a landlord and would never in a million years rent to people like that. They will ruin your property and you will never recoup from the stress / drama and property damage they will cause.

It\u2019s not fun cleaning them every day but that\u2019s how you keep your house clean. I had 2 mama cats that each had 4 kittens. Never once did any of them piss or shit anywhere inside but a litter box. This is completely a fair stipulation you are putting on her to rent. What she\u2019s really looking for is a free ride!", "NTA I have 4 cats and none of them act this way. My house does not smell like we have 4 cats. It\u2019s called having clean litter boxes and not tolerating bad behavior. You should also never mix business and friendship like this. Sounds like she\u2019s a friend not worth holding onto because at this point she\u2019s trying to use you and ruin your other friendships. It sucks to be evicted but she did it to herself.", "NTA - if you didn\u2019t know her personally, would you rent to her?  Probably not. Never mix business with pleasure.  Today it\u2019s reduced rent, tomorrow, it\u2019s can\u2019t afford rent, but you understand right?  After all, you have plenty of properties\u2026", "NTA\n\nIn Portugal there's a saying that goes close to \" friends friends but business aside\"\n\nYou are doinq well, don't budge. \n\nIf any of your friends were truely willing to help they would give her their spare room.", "NTA don\u2019t do it. \u201cFriends\u201d always think they have special privileges. She is already asking for a rent reduction and upfront doesn\u2019t want to abide by your rules. You see how they live and why they\u2019re getting evicted they aren\u2019t going to treat your property any better. These are your investments and money and you are not obligated to rent to someone who is going to take advantage and damage your home. You are not responsible for living conditions she is. Tell those friends who think you should make an exception if they\u2019ll co-sign the lease agreement and be responsible for any damages made to the property. SMH never mix business with family or friends", "NTA. Congrats on busting out of low income and owning 4 properties! That's my goal as well to own property as stocks don't interest me as much. \n\nYou own the property and you can make the rules. The biggest problem for landlords is people that dont look after the property to the point that the deposit is too low to actually cover repairs. \n\nI feel bad for your friend on one hand but also not. She put herself into this mess", "You don't own 4 rental properties, you own a business and she's asking for a handout. That's not how business works! NTA!   \n\nAs for the other friends bugging you: They should know their living situation. Make an estimate how much ot will cost to repair the damage done and ask people pushing you whether they would be willing to host themselves OR put up a security for the damages which are going to occur.", ">Cats peeing everywhere is NOT normal. It's either health, stress, or lack of proper litter care. \n\nMost likely the last thing. The husband is not cleaning at all, even when his wife is pregnant seemingly and OP described their apartment on the brink of a hoarder episode. So in all likelihood the litter boxes are just so dirty that the cats don't want to shit and piss in it. \n\nThey might also not have enough. I think 5 are recommended for 4 cats. That can also get expensive. All the litter they need for them and they don't seem to be rich, so another reason why they might not clean them out often enough.\n\nThe other reason you mentioned are also possible, maybe in addition to the litter box problem. Also some cats like to mark their territory. If the group of 4 cats are not harmonious, that would increase the chance.\n\nAlso it wouldn't surprise me if they don't have proper scratching posts.\n\nOP's friend said the cats are like her children, but she doesn't seem to take properly care of them. I hope she takes better care of her human children. Though letting the one already born live in an apartment with cat piss everywhere doesn't sound promising.", "I mean some cats can be total assholes\u2026 my cat had a lovely clean try, but still decided to piss on the dogs bed, I think cause she hated the dog\u2026.she eventually stopped doing it and stopped attacking the poor dog on sight (she really hated the dogs for a couple years and even though they were just sleeping away minding their own business she would attack. \n\nHowever if that cat is pissing everywhere and anywhere that is a smell that OP will NEVER get rid of. I was offered a move by my HA to somewhere you could very clearly smell cat piss in, and turned it down since I knew exactly what my cat would do, start pissing over the top of it to mark her territory and leave her scent behind. Even the most well behaved non asshole cat would (if they exist)", "They might be unneutered males spraying everywhere too.", "You\u2019re right, someone should call animal control because those cats deserve better.", "Op mentioned a hoarding situation that could be stressful for them amongst having to live in their own waste.\n\nNot healthy for op's pregnant friend either.", "My mom did basically exactly what OP did. I was close friends with her daughter, and then drifted apart as teens. When they moved out, it had turned into an animal hoarding situation. The animal piss was insane, literally dry heaving trying to clean it out. It was awful.", " Exactly. I might be ok with friends or relatives that have shown I can trust, but in this case, just reading about the cats peeing all over, was a deal breaker.", "Yes, friend has given OP a choice of whether to lose the friend, or the friend and the house. Not a great choice, but one with a clear answer.", "Came here to say this. Considering what he said about them, it\u2018s probably a cleanliness issue. Cats will not go in a dirty box. What is clean? Laundry, clothes, even a bed. Those poor animals. They should be re-homed with someone who is not a hoarder.  NTA", "Intact tomcats (and females in heat) are notorious for spraying absolutely everywhere. So that might be a reason\u2026", "Farmers actually work.", "Yall run straight into the point and continue to miss it lmao. Yeah hoarding resources needed by people that they're entitled to by right of existing as a person on this planet (food shelter etc) makes you an AH. It isn't hard lol", "I dunno, seems like everyone can do that. Many people surely dont need many things they do have but they still have them when they couldve used the money to donate. Whats your point?", "I was speaking about apartments.", "They were brother and sister, and the female was very finicky about the litter box. I have no doubt she's the one who made that rule!", "Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate your time.", "Um, the title?", "NTA", "Do not let them in!!", "NTA and the cats need vet care or help or to neutered/spayed. The unclean living conditions on are her not the cats. They sell this amazing thing called enzyme cleaner. \n\nOut of 3 my cats 1 cat peed out of the box once when he had bladder crystals.... he got vet help and uses the box like a champ now. \n\nMaybe lie and say no property is currently available?", "NTA\nTell the friends who are saying that you should make an exception that you'll be happy to help move her into their properties. \n\nThis is a disaster waiting to happen. She's going to trash your place, not pay rent on time, and then make you the bad guy when you have to evict her. \n\nIf you feel that you WANT to help her (and you are in NO way obligated to do so) you could spot her some cash, but don't expect that you'll ever see it again.  Maybe those friends who are so adamant about you helping her out can chip in.", "NTA\n\nAnd cats mostly don't maliciously pee. Or at least not indescriminately.\n\nIt sounds like health issues or litter box issues that the owners are deeply neglecting to look into.", "NTA\nI mean it sounds like you have mutual friends who will happily let her stay in their homes so that her cats can use it as a toilet. She's got other options clearly!", "I would say, \"I currently do not have any openings available to rent to you.\" \n\nThis is a BAD idea and she had the audacity to ask for a rent reduction?! Those other friends can home her and find out exactly why they are getting evicted! DONT let them talk you into anything, and go with your gut!  NTA", "NTa. I would call CPS so someone with the weight and seriousness of the government behind them can come and lecture her and her husband about letting their child live in filth, and being pregnant in a space where 4 feral cats pee everywhere every day.", "NTA -  tell your other friends to house her then.  Don\u2019t mix friendship and business.  I\u2019d point out to your other friends you have bills to pay on it, it\u2019s not some extra guest hour or vacation home.  As for the person, they don\u2019t sound great and sound like there using you.  I\u2019d basically state this is part of your livelihood and if they respond poorly or don\u2019t respond go LC.  That being said I think the friendship is over, they are clearly trying to use and abuse your friendship.\n\nI mean they trashed the previous apartment and are getting evicted, have basically told you they are going to do the same to your apartment then have the gall to ask for a discount.  The friendship ends now or it ends in 6 months when your trying to evict them for squatting and not paying them having to repair the apartment.  If you have pictures of the previous place you should show them to friends calling you out on this as well.  If they are still not with you they probably aren\u2019t good people either", "NTA.  To the friends who says you should do exception, ask them if they are willing to pay for deposit  for cat damage and    to pay for a cleaner to come in every week  to that apartment, it has to be signed  and legal  if they say yes and  that the friends only can stay as long as the cleaning service is in place.Also  ask them to take the cat to the  vet to check up  their  health .\n\nI think people will back off then.\n\nFriends should help friends, so why should you be the only one helping?", "NTA. You already know that they will not be good tenants - do not let them destroy your property. Rather sit them down and explain that you wish to remain friends, and friends only. A tenant-landlord relationship is vastly different.\n\nI personally am renting my old apartment to one of my best friends who I've visited several times before and know their living habits. We also made an official lease and when we discussed rent, my friend specifically said for me to ask them the same price I would from a random - as they would feel really awkward to pay less simply because of our friendship. I did end up asking them the lower end of what I was thinking of asking, because I also don't want to take advantage of them! But I am explaining this to explain how a friend should behave - if it is mutually beneficial, then go ahead but in this case it is clear they would benefit more and odds are that your friendship would not survive!", "NTA..  as a general rule I would never want to mix business and friends/family. Would probably consider if they couldn't find alternate accommodation however in this situation I wouldn't because... \n\n1. the 4 cats and lack of hygiene \n2. Asking outright for a rent reduction. This is a massive red flag, I think they would just refuse to pay and turn into squatters. \n\nDon't give in", "Nta. I thought it\u2019s a safety concern for pregnant women to be around cats!", "NTA\n\nShe'd wreck your property and rant that you didn't give her a better place. That friendship was over she got the eviction, she didn't need to look for a new place cause you have it and you have to give it to her. \nLose the friend and save the apartment, don't rent to her under any circumstances.", "NTA.  she will 100% stop paying rent at some point and expect you to put up with it because \"friendship\". And then you'll have lost income and a ruined house.", "She's not your friend babe", "NTA, and also cats peeing everywhere is not a normal thing , its probably due to lack of proper litter box care...", "NTA. don't do it.", "NTA for not letting them stay but \n\nYTA for telling them to get rid of their cats if they want to stay", "NTA\u2014She is a poor tenant and was evicted for a reason.

Protect your peace!", "For the love of God, do not rent your property out to her!!! She\u2019s been evicted. EVICTED!!!! Before she moved in she already asked for reduction in rent and refused to even entertain to not bring pets. \n\nThis is what is happening. You are a pushover. Period. I know it. She knows it. Quite frankly, you know it. People like her prey on the weakness of others, and they\u2019re good at manipulating outside parties to put more pressure on their mark. YOU are the mark. If you think this won\u2019t end with her not paying rent and you also having to evict her, then you\u2019ll deserve everything that happens. \n\nNTA.

Your property will be destroyed, your friendship will be over when she stops paying and you have to evict her. NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd her poor children. AKA her human children. The ones who SHOULD matter most. Living with a home with cat urine is so gross and unhealthy. Please call CPS. That is absurd and not okay. Makes me so so sad. Also for the cats. They don't like the harsh smell of their urine. The smell can harm them, too. Absolutely horrible.", "NTA and honestly I think it\u2019s kind you\u2019re offering for her to move in at all\u2026 maybe I\u2019m too harsh but I think I would be staying no all together. We aren\u2019t talking about her borrowing some clothes here. This is a huge and expensive investment that you\u2019ve worked hard for and its absolutely up to you what you do with it.", "NTA. Business and friends don't mix well often. This is a great example. Your friend knows you have a business that can help her. She even thinks you should help her as far as paying part of her life from your business. She needs to accept the consequences of her actions. If her household (cats included) trash places, then they will keep on getting evicted time and time again. \n\nYou were going to lose this friendship one way or another. She would become a tenant of hell. You'd need to go all business on her, kick her out and that would've been the end of it anyway. So better to rip that bandaid of now, so at least you don't have thousands of euro's (or what ever currency) in damages.", "NTA\n\nYou gave her your stipulations and she's already refusing them. Imagine what will happen if you do rent to them? They won't clean the house no matter what you say. Then it'll be hard to get them out!\n\nN O\n\nYou know it's not YOUR fault that she's about to be homeless, you're not responsible for her choices! I'd be petty and post the real story on social media and tell everyone that if they're judging you so bad that they can help her in your stead. Then just watch everyone scatter and come up with excuses. Who'd want to rent to a couple, friend or not, that have 4 cats they don't clean up after (we have two plus a toddler, there is no way our cats are peeing everywhere) plus the husband is a slob?! Nope\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why would you voluntarily rent to anyone with the issues you have witnessed first hand? You\u2019re better off losing this friend before they cost you thousands of dollars in property damage and lost rental income.", "NTA This sounds like a mess waiting to happen. You could have had a very costly, bitter, drawn out end to this relationship. It is not your fault she's homeless. If they've been evicted because of their behaviour, then that's on them, not you. If you had said yes, you may have well just been giving up the house because how would take their money when they were struggling financially or ask them to change their behaviour as friends.", "NTA.

We're renting off a couple that are our friends and one of them was my partner's work colleague!

Our friendship doesn't mix with business", "Yeah my youngest cat is an AH but she\u2019s clean and uses her litter tray!", "Exactly! I had 4 cats at one time and there was no mess or smell, and a teaching business was successfully run in the same home. You clean up after them promptly and have enough litter trays for them to use, treat them when they're sick and give them plenty to do. Sounds like these cats aren't being cared for properly or have underlying health issues.", "Was thinking this exactly! When my cat was small, before being neutered and when in heat, would absolutely pee anywhere she felt like it, regardless of the clean litter box. After being neutered, that never happened again."]}
