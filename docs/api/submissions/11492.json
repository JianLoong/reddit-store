I graduated from pharmacy school with minimal debt and bought my first rental property. I currently own 4 rental properties with my fianc\u00e9. We both learned how to remodel and fix basic things to keep costs low. We use the rental property money to invest in stocks and looking into buying a 5th property. \n\nMy best friend (32F) of 15 years has been married to her husband for 3 years and they have 1 child and 1 on the way. Their landlord has decided to evict them. He has given them 60 days to find a new place. They have asked if they could live in one of my rental properties.\n\nThe problem is they are not very clean people and that is one of the main reasons for their eviction. My friend has 4 cats and they pee EVERYWHERE. On their clothes, sofa and beds. They also tend to scratch the walls and  cabinets. She just says it\u2019s just because they\u2019re a*holes. Their current home is on the brink of being on a hoarders episode. Her husband spends his free time playing video games and does not try to help in cleaning or doing any \u201cwoman\u201d chores. \n\nMy friend has also asked if we could give her a discount on the rent since they are about to have their 2nd baby.  Both of them work but my friend\u2019s job  will not pay her the whole time she is on maternity leave. \n\nI told her I could give her a temporary reduction on the rent but she would not be allowed to have the cats. She said they are like her children and could not get rid of them. She said that would be like asking to get rid of her human children and I am the a*hole for even suggesting it. I told her those were my stipulations. I have been fortunate that my tenants with pets are respectful and clean up religiously after them. \n\nShe currently is not talking to me and telling our other friends that it\u2019s my fault she is about homeless. A couple of friends have said I should make an exception but  I\u2019ve put so much time and money into these homes. So am I the asshole for telling my friend she can\u2019t move in with her cats?", "created_utc": 1677975414, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ihyy1/aita_for_refusing_to_rent_to_my_pregnant_friend/", "score": 2837, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nonpayment isn't the only reason someone can be evicted....with failure to keep the property reasonably clean and in good upkeep being nearly on par with nonpayment. \n\nYou are within your right not to allow pets. Many rentals dont...usually because they have had to pay for tens of thousands of dollars to repair the damage from pets....urine soaked floors, urine soaked drywall, scratched and chewed walls, dug up yards etc. \n\nPlus cat urine is PUTRID.

You\u2019ve seen their home, are you sure you\u2019re going to be ok seeing your rental property all dirty and damaged?! Also because she\u2019s your friend she will most likely not want to pay full rent amount, and also have an excuse for it every time. \nAsk those friends if they\u2019ve been to her home, and if they would be ok with cat piss everywhere in their home.

She\u2019ll destroy that place just like she did the last place. And more then likely she\u2019ll use your friendship to get out of paying rent. We lost a rental property because my husband (at the time) let his friends rent it. Every month it was something. Oh boo boo if we pay the rent we can\u2019t afford groceries for the kids. Boo boo if we pay the rent instead of the gas bill our heat will get shut off. And he let them slide on it over and over. Got so behind on the mortgage it ended up being foreclosed. Turned out they were really just putting the money aside every month to save up to buy their own house (do I sound a little bitter?). So don\u2019t feel guilty about saying no. You have to think of your own family first.", "Yikes, do not rent to them! NTA", "NTA those friends who think you should make an exception should offer them a place to stay", "NTA .. You did make an offer.  It just had one stipulation - no pets.  Totally reasonable.

That's all on them. She has time to find another place.", "NTA. \nI\u2019m a landlord and would never in a million years rent to people like that. They will ruin your property and you will never recoup from the stress / drama and property damage they will cause.
