I graduated from pharmacy school with minimal debt and bought my first rental property. I currently own 4 rental properties with my fianc\u00e9. We both learned how to remodel and fix basic things to keep costs low. We use the rental property money to invest in stocks and looking into buying a 5th property. \n\nMy best friend (32F) of 15 years has been married to her husband for 3 years and they have 1 child and 1 on the way. Their landlord has decided to evict them. He has given them 60 days to find a new place. They have asked if they could live in one of my rental properties.\n\nThe problem is they are not very clean people and that is one of the main reasons for their eviction. My friend has 4 cats and they pee EVERYWHERE. On their clothes, sofa and beds. They also tend to scratch the walls and  cabinets. She just says it\u2019s just because they\u2019re a*holes. Their current home is on the brink of being on a hoarders episode. Her husband spends his free time playing video games and does not try to help in cleaning or doing any \u201cwoman\u201d chores. \n\nMy friend has also asked if we could give her a discount on the rent since they are about to have their 2nd baby.  Both of them work but my friend\u2019s job  will not pay her the whole time she is on maternity leave. \n\nI told her I could give her a temporary reduction on the rent but she would not be allowed to have the cats. She said they are like her children and could not get rid of them. She said that would be like asking to get rid of her human children and I am the a*hole for even suggesting it. I told her those were my stipulations. I have been fortunate that my tenants with pets are respectful and clean up religiously after them. \n\nShe currently is not talking to me and telling our other friends that it\u2019s my fault she is about homeless. A couple of friends have said I should make an exception but  I\u2019ve put so much time and money into these homes. So am I the asshole for telling my friend she can\u2019t move in with her cats?", "created_utc": 1677975414, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ihyy1/aita_for_refusing_to_rent_to_my_pregnant_friend/", "score": 328, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do your tenants deserve to have people move in that you know will wreck their place and let their cats pee everywhere? Do they deserve the smell and the bugs this will bring? I can pretty much promise you a cat will escape and pee in the hallway. You will need up having to evict them anyway, probably losing tenants in the process, thousands of dollars of damage, and you'll lose that friend anyway. \n\nIf the cats are peeing everywhere, they're not cleaning the litter box, don't have enough litter boxes, the cats are sick, and/or not spayed or neutered.

Nonpayment isn't the only reason someone can be evicted....with failure to keep the property reasonably clean and in good upkeep being nearly on par with nonpayment. \n\nYou are within your right not to allow pets. Many rentals dont...usually because they have had to pay for tens of thousands of dollars to repair the damage from pets....urine soaked floors, urine soaked drywall, scratched and chewed walls, dug up yards etc. \n\nPlus cat urine is PUTRID.

You\u2019ve seen their home, are you sure you\u2019re going to be ok seeing your rental property all dirty and damaged?! Also because she\u2019s your friend she will most likely not want to pay full rent amount, and also have an excuse for it every time. \nAsk those friends if they\u2019ve been to her home, and if they would be ok with cat piss everywhere in their home.

She\u2019ll destroy that place just like she did the last place. And more then likely she\u2019ll use your friendship to get out of paying rent. We lost a rental property because my husband (at the time) let his friends rent it. Every month it was something. Oh boo boo if we pay the rent we can\u2019t afford groceries for the kids. Boo boo if we pay the rent instead of the gas bill our heat will get shut off. And he let them slide on it over and over. Got so behind on the mortgage it ended up being foreclosed. Turned out they were really just putting the money aside every month to save up to buy their own house (do I sound a little bitter?). So don\u2019t feel guilty about saying no. You have to think of your own family first.", "Yikes, do not rent to them! NTA", "NTA those friends who think you should make an exception should offer them a place to stay", "NTA .. You did make an offer.  It just had one stipulation - no pets.  Totally reasonable.  I'm guessing the friends telling you that you're heartless or whatever aren't jumping to help take the family and pissing cats in either.", "NTA, she is not getting evicted because of you. That's all on them. She has time to find another place.", "NTA. \nI\u2019m a landlord and would never in a million years rent to people like that. They will ruin your property and you will never recoup from the stress / drama and property damage they will cause.

She's going to trash the place and barely pay you, if she bothers to pay at all since you're friends. \n\nAbsolutely not OP.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nCat pee is one of the most soffit smells to eradicate.  If a cat pees on carpet, it can soak into the sub flooring. Sometimes removing the carpet is not enough to eliminate the smell and the entire floor has to be replaced.\n\nI feel sorry for those cats, though. Most cats are happy to use their litter boxes. I\u2019m guessing the boxes aren\u2019t cleaned nearly enough and/or there are too many cats for the space, both of which can lead to spraying.\n\nAll those friends telling you to make an exception\u2014they can invite the family into their own homes.", "You\u2019re not an AITA at all. No. There are certain situations that run a higher risk for you as the friend/landlord to loose a friend due to a rental situation gone bad then not. She doesn\u2019t rent from you\u2026 you can help her find a place and keep the friendship.", "NTA.  Mixing business and pleasure (i.e. friendship) is often a recipe for disaster. Or as grandpa used to say, \"Don't shit where you eat.\"", "NTA", "NTA. What, lol, you don\u2019t want to rent to her and her six \u201chuman children\u201d? She can make it work for her actual human children and street the cats or she can figure something else out. She\u2019s not entitled to destroy your properties.", "NTA.\n\nAs a landlord I would never allow pets on my properties.\n\nOP your friendship is over with this person either way. At least this way you don't end up with a trashed rental.\n\nBusiness is just business. If a \"friend\" can't understand that then their friendship isn't worth it in the first place", "NTA\n\nYou should absolutely not rent to these people.  You never want to mix friendship and business, and being a landlord is a business.\n\nPlus, you already know that she will destroy your home.  And she has the nerve to ask for a discount?  NOPE!!!!!\n\nJust be blunt.  You value her friendship and don't want to mix business with friendship.  It never ends well.", "I wouldn\u2019t have told her anything but no.\n\nDon\u2019t mix friends with business. I can understand wanting to help out a friend but it almost always ends badly if you do. Instead you saw the writing in the wall.\n\nBut like callous as it is. Even if she was clean and orderly, having a friend with a family move in is asking for a bad time. Because the minute something went wrong now your kicking \u201ca friend out with young children.\u201d\n\nDont ever do that to yourself. Just make a hard line. No personal relationships in the business. All renters are strangers.", "NTA.\n\nNever rent to family or friends.\n\nOftentimes, they're far, far more likely to screw you over than a stranger. Your friend is already demonstrating it by her failure to control her animals and her eviction, but the blazing warning sign is the \"can we have a discount\" on top of *everything* else. This situation would likely be if you lose a friend now or a \"friend\" later with a massive repair bill.", "NTA. Your property is a business that you worked hard for. Letting someone move in that you know will be a problem is not good business and not a good way to preserve your friendship either. Her filth might actually affect other tenants too, not just the unit she destroys with feline urine.", "Absolutely NTA.", "NTA, sorry your rental has stringent rules that she can't adhere...then that's that.\n\nBased on the fact that she's also asking for reduced rent, on top of knowing her pets bother you, makes me feel like they'll also be the type of renter who asks if they can pause on payments because they're broke...and then you give in and pay their housing for free... while waiting for courts to open up so you can officially evict them.\n\nJust don't go there. Don't rent to her. They're adults, they can figure it out.", "If this is a friend you care about and it\u2019s feasible for you, I would give her the first month and deposit to rent a place but hell would freeze over before I would move her into my own rental.", "NTA. My mom has her share of rental properties, and the results of tenants like this has ended in either legal battles, or intense cleaning sessions you'll never get the time or money back for. You know for a fact that they're bad tenants in other properties. Why would either of them change now, especially when her husband is lazy and she's pregnant/can't clean well because of it?", "Exactly.  I currently have 7 adult cats (some fosters, a few mine).  One has kidney disease, one has gastro problems and the rest pride themselves on just how much poop and pee they can produce.  Not ONE OF THEM eliminates outside the box.  It\u2019s a LOT of boxes, and the fedex ex guy probably hates me cause I buy litter in 35 lb bags, lol.\n\nThe boxes all get dumped morning and night, it\u2019s quick with sifting trays, and goes out to the trash can immediately.  There\u2019s no reason healthy cats should be going outside the box.", "This. OP, text your friend, \"I'm so sorry for suggesting you should get rid of your cats to live at one of my rentals. I've thought long and hard about it, and I think it's better we simply don't mix business and friendship. I care about you too much to do that.\"\n\nThen, leave it at that. She'll still be mad, but you took the offer off the table. You won't have her ruin one of your rental properties, and you have pulled back the idea of taking away her cats.", "If it were me, I might be stupid enough to do business with a friend I thought I could trust, but even I wouldn't do business with someone with a history demonstrating I can't trust them.\n\nNTA You know what would happen if they moved in. Your friend doesn't have a right to demand you be okay with cat pee all over your house.", "Or with family either for that matter.", "Dead on.", "So true", "Yeap. My friends cat is also an a-hole and he uses the litter box all the time.  He just steals all of the hair ties rather then revenge poops.  There must be thousands of them hidden behind the couch", "Yea, just save the money. NTA.", "Yep they will trash your place, stop paying rent, and you\u2019ll end up having a hard time evicting,  ending friendship anyway. \n\nI would *maybe* help if I had a place that needed gutting anyway and you thought they\u2019d keep up with the rent but aside from that no way.", ">But I doubt you could get away with allowing some tenants to have cats and others to not have them. \n\nI do this.  Having cats is not a protected class.  I denied a request to get a cat by one tenant because she is a slob (and pays her rent late frequently) even though there is another tenant in my building with a pet.", "Lol!!!! Such a dumb fucking response.", "Hey, not all landlords are evil. They provide a service....a place for people to live. Not all renters are poor. Your comments are ridiculous.", "Hey Im actually going to upvote this foolishness so more people can see the kind of  brilliant intelligence you've posted here.\n\n>YTA. For being a landlord.\n\nPsst your rent was due 3 days ago", "yep if her husband can\u2019t be bothered to clean up after himself there\u2019s no way he\u2019s scooping the litter box(es) daily. Honestly doubt they have more than 1 litter box, which is probably also part of the problem.", "I didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t refuse to rent to a pregnant renter. I said you couldn\u2019t discriminate against a pregnant renter; in other words, pregnancy cannot be factored into your decision to deny them a tenancy.\n\nIt\u2019s simple reading comprehension.", "I don\u2019t know where you are, but this is illegal in California.  According to the news publication SF Gate, The same rules have to apply to everyone. However, if a pet becomes a nuisance, then the landlord can order it to be removed. \n\nSince you claim that your friend lets her cats pee everywhere and tear up the furnishings, you could probably deny her cats if you can prove she has a poor history with them.", "Landlords always get so touchy about it when anyone criticizes their non-job.", "OP never mentioned not renting because they are pregnant. Speaking of reading comprehension. \n\nIt's their mutual \"friends\" who treat pregnancy as an entitlement to get whatever they want, to hell with common sense. They are saying \"how can you NOT rent to a pregnant person.\"\n\nSimple. They are slob animal abusers who allow their pets to completely decimate property and live in piles of garbage.\n\nOP offered their friend a solution. You can rent from me...but no pets allowed....which is more than generous considering that their previous landlord was left to clean up a landfill of a house.", "Thr fact that the friend is pregnant is relevant as to whether or not OP is an AH. Because the friends who think JUST like you. The pregnancy is NOT a factor in anything but moral judgement. \n\nThe friend could flout their pregnancy in front of a court all they want. All OP has to show is the references from the previous landlord and it would be thrown out. \n\nPregnancy has ZERO bearing in this case, whether OP mentions it or not.", "I never said that the OP mentioned not renting because the friend is pregnant. I cautioned against citing pregnancy as one of the reasons for not renting to them. Like I said, reading comprehension is important.  But I guess repeating it to you is ironic.", "I never said it did. And you don\u2019t know anything about me. But keep making up wild scenarios in your head."]}
