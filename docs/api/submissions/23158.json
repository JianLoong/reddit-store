We live together, I'm right now staying home with our baby, and my husband works all day (he is taking more hours to earn more money, because we want to move to a bigger house).\nSo the whole day I need to watch out child, do house work, cook dinner, then when my husband (who is also exhausted from work) comes from work and takes over the care of our baby, so I could at least shower and eat something. \nAnd the worst thing is that our baby has galactosemia (it gets diagnosed in first days after being born, doctors take baby's blood from the heel and send ir to the laboratory. And that test came positive). So our baby needs special formula, if he will eat my breast milk or ather milks it will have life long consequences ( development delays, cataract, speech delay, kidney diseases and many more), and baby will be vomiting, will become lethargic, will have diarrhea and many other symptoms.\nAfter some time my husband's mother suggested that she would come and help us for few days and we agreed. So after few days she came, husband was still at work. So we started talking, we never had like good relationship ship, but we respected each other.\nThen after some talking she said that I should take a shower and she will look after our baby. I showed her where is baby formula and told her how to make it, and said to her that our baby can't have any milk (it was told multiple time to her by me and my husband that our baby has galactosemia and that it can't have milk)\nI went to the shower and after 10 minutes I heard my baby crying, so I quickly rinsed off and ran to the living room where my baby was and mother in law. She was sitting there and feeding my baby. So I came up to her and said: \"oh you are already feeding the baby, thank you\"\nShe said: \"yeah he is really hungry, you can go and do your things, I'm feeding him some milk, because you don't give him any, and I thought it would be good for him.\"\nI looked at her like a deer in the headlights, for few seconds I froze and then yanked the bottle out of her hands. She started yelling at me and saying what the hell am I doing. I grabbed my baby and also started yelling at her to get the fuck out. \nI kicked her out and called my husband, I told him everything and he was just furious. He called him mom and told that she is not welcomed at out house anymore, because she knew that our baby can't have milk.\nWe had horrible night, our baby was vomiting and having diarrhea, but thankfully he didn't drink a lot of milk so it wasn't really bad.\nShe was calling us the whole night, but we didn't answer any calls and we are not planning to answer he any time soon. But my husband's grandmother called us and said that we were too cruel for kicking her out and she didn't mean any harm to our baby. She knew really well that our baby can't have any milk and she still gave him milk, but still AITA for kicking her out?\n\nEDIT: There are a lot of people in the comments asking is she mentally ill, does she have dementia, or does she have any psychological problems. NO, she does not. She always seemed fine, just like any other human.

So sorry that happened.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand. Why are old people so fucking stubborn? This was not a overreaction at all. Your husbands grandma is simply on her daughters team, don\u2019t let them guilt you", "NTA.  She seems to be the type \"let me see if what they say are true if the baby drinks the milk.\"   Tell grandma that and to stop defending her daughter's bad behavior.  She could have caused life lasting damage to your child.  Would she be okay with that? If so, she won't be seeing the baby either.", "Nope, NTA. And I was raised in an ex Soviet country. Yes, I was given cows milk, but that started when I was around 2 years old, according to my mum.\n\nWhat your MIL did was beyond stupid and dangerous. Your son has a medical condition, and she decided she knew better than everyone else. Don't feel bad for kicking her out, OP. The way I see it, she did that to herself.", "agree.  Let it be known to Grandma how she was warned multiple times that he can't have milk and what the consequences are, both short term and long term.  then ask grandma, given all this information, why would your mom still choose to give your child milk?  crickets... there's absolutely no excuse for what she did", "I drank goat's milk as a baby. I was fine. I still adore it.

In fact it\u2019s *recommended* to introduce cows milk at 6 months, tho obviously not as an exclusive feeding source. Not before then however.\n\nOur pediatrician was very clear that it\u2019s not only recommended, but helpful from an allergy standpoint.", "Lots of baby formula is based on cow milk.", "Exactly my thoughts as I was reading this. OP shouldn't have even had to tell MIL, she's had kids and she should know you do not give a baby MILK.", "Yes, we did everything that we could, if it would get bad we would absolutely call an ambulance. We monitored him, we were giving him water with teaspoons to replace lost fluids, we were doing it constantly.", "No she has no cognitive impairment, she is perfectly healthy mentally also.", "Thank you so much!", "It doesn't excuse her. Russian here. I drank goat's milk .(i wasn't allergic though) \n\nBut i would never, never give the baby milk if i was told not to! I know what being lactose-intolerant means.

It's all in her head\"", "Back then people have cow milk to babies because there was nothing else. Living in a communist country is very different. Just to be clear- people from that region are extremely over protective of their children/grandchildren so her behavior is not normal. She is the exact opposite of how people usually are", "it literally doesn\u2019t matter. we are in the correct moment and you both communicated to her the severity of your child\u2019s health and cows milk. she disrespected both of you and is now facing the consequences", "This explains a lot. It's not just about cow's milk, but the absolute lack of respect for other's wishes and 'knowing best' that's very familiar to anyone with a family member from the FSU.", "Doesn't matter, you flat out told her it would make baby sick.", "didn't you tell her not to??", "If she can't be trusted with this, something she was told multiple times, then she can't be trusted with *anything* when it comes to your baby.\n\nKeep her away from your baby is my advice.  Even if she apologizes.\n\nbig time NTA", "I would need an explanation for why she wasn\u2019t clocking that your baby is different after being told that fact multiple times. Yes. Milk for babies is a common thing, but if you\u2019ve been told by the parents multiple times that there\u2019s an important medical reason not to give them that milk like developmental delays and vision problems, then wtf?! I mean, I would really need an answer to that before I could even attempt any further discussions.", "She could have grown up thinking that milk is required to continue breathing just as much as air.\n\nYou gave her new information and she chose to ignore it, at risk of your child's life.", "YOU ARE NTA, I am sorry I don't care where someone is from. You were clear, your husband was clear and she deliberately endangered your baby. That is awful . She better be lucky your child did not have even worse side effects.", "So what? You told her specifically not to do something. She\u2019s old, not deaf and stupid.", "Cow's milk doesn't have enough/the right nutrients for an infant and can cause intestinal bleeding when given too early. There's a reason you wait.", "When did your doctor recommend this? As far as I know, currently the recommendation is that babies are not supposed to drink cow\u2019s milk until a year old.\n\nETA: Yup, just double-checked and NO cow\u2019s milk until 12 months. This is the case in the US and Spain, at the very least.", "My (almost) 2yr old granddaughter has a cows milk allergy and even when she was newborn all advice from doctors, health visitors, midwife etc, was no cows milk for under 1yrs old.... I have 4 kids, all adults now but even back then it was always no cows milk.\n\nNot sure where you are in the world but here in the UK they do not recommend cows milk until after the child turns 1. However, some food products that contain cows milk can be introduced from around 6 months, such as cheese and plain yoghurt but it has to be a small amount and pasteurised milk. \n\nMaybe this is where there's some confusion?... \n\nEither way, OPs baby is only 2 months old so food products aren't being introduced yet. The MIL should know better.", "Actually in my country it is recommended to start with kefir, I. E. milk processed by bacteria. Milk is recommended much, much later.", "Lots of formula has cows milk products in it but it's had something done to it to make it suitable for babies.\n\nThere are of course, cows milk free formulas such as vegan formula and some for babies with cows milk allergy.\n\nMy granddaughter had Aptimil Pepti 1 and now has oat milk instead fo cows milk (she's almost 2).", "A police report does not take long, especially since I'm assuming you have all her information. (Full name, birthday, address, phone number, etc.) Filing a police report now and having it on record will make it easier to convict her in the future if something else happens. I understand you have your hands full with a sickly newborn and both you and your husband being constantly exhausted, but it's worth it in the long run. If you have the time to take the trip to the police station in your district, you should take it.", "If anything happens again?!?  One more time could be too late.", "I'd recommend seeing if you can file a report or get some kind of legal no contact order, the reason is that you want to make it abundantly clear to her and the family just how serious what she did was. At the end of the day, you're lucky you're only just asking for advice on reddit about how to deal with her, not planning your baby's funeral.\n\nThe problem with people like your MIL is that they don't take just being told \"no\" very well, she's a danger and working against your child's best interest.", "I guarantee you time will pass and your husband will want to bring his mom around baby again", "She should not even be allowed near the baby or in your house. She could still sneak allergens into your place or harm the baby otherwise.", "You need to hit that home, including the grandma.

People/babies with galactosaemia are literally poisoned by milk, their liver can't process it properly and it makes toxins instead. Those toxins can cause brain damage and liver damage.\n\nOP's baby will be OK, babies who aren't diagnosed at birth usually have a couple of months on milk and recover once they're diagnosed and they get the special feed instead, but this is much more serious than lactose intolerance.", "Well some people are just not like this sadly, I live in ex soviet union country and see that a lot of people are really protective of their children, but sadly there are some who are not", "I don't think she *wanted* to hurt the baby, but people like her will and have literally killed children in their quest to be \"right\" and superior to the actual mother and doctors caring for the child.

Hopefully, it cleared the air", "I'm guessing she basically went through:\n\n\"I know she *says* that but I've been a parent, I've always given milk, it's never been and issue.  She's probably just being paranoid or is misinformed.  She's new to this and I know better, after all\"\n\nOf course that probably all happened in an instant as she was being told about the illness and restriction, which she furtively dismissed.", "Bot", "I think you very correct she cannot ever be trusted alone with your child.

Absolutely horrific, the worst thing I read on the internet to date.

It\u2019s not fair but i guarantee this situation will happen again", "Yeah, it's always good to have just in case. Best of luck to the three of you.", "It\u2019s kind of a weird block in their brain. My MIL was convinced my first child was a carbon copy of her perfect son.  Child is lactose intolerant, I\u2019d turn around and she\u2019s giving him milk, totally indignant but husband had milk. As child got older gave my kid pepsi instead of water child hated fizzy drinks, but but husband always drank pepsi. Kid loves honey mustard MIL would throw it away because husband doesn\u2019t like honey mustard. The woman had a mental block that my child was not 100% his father. It was really creepy and she honestly was furious with us because we wouldn\u2019t let her treat child like she did my husband. We finally never turned our back because she could not mentally see son and her son as two separate people. Your MIL hopefully isn\u2019t this interesting but I bet there is some of that mindset in play. You are NTA but your MIL is a bit crazy.", "Yeah, it's a tough one. I've heard and read a lot of stories about people not taking allergies seriously and causing harm, but that one is the worst.", "Tbf sometimes they aren\u2019t and they just destroy the eggs\u2026 MIL is a bad ostrich \ud83e\udd23", "Unfortunately I think you're right.
