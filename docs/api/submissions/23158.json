We live together, I'm right now staying home with our baby, and my husband works all day (he is taking more hours to earn more money, because we want to move to a bigger house).\nSo the whole day I need to watch out child, do house work, cook dinner, then when my husband (who is also exhausted from work) comes from work and takes over the care of our baby, so I could at least shower and eat something. \nAnd the worst thing is that our baby has galactosemia (it gets diagnosed in first days after being born, doctors take baby's blood from the heel and send ir to the laboratory. And that test came positive). So our baby needs special formula, if he will eat my breast milk or ather milks it will have life long consequences ( development delays, cataract, speech delay, kidney diseases and many more), and baby will be vomiting, will become lethargic, will have diarrhea and many other symptoms.\nAfter some time my husband's mother suggested that she would come and help us for few days and we agreed. So after few days she came, husband was still at work. So we started talking, we never had like good relationship ship, but we respected each other.\nThen after some talking she said that I should take a shower and she will look after our baby. I showed her where is baby formula and told her how to make it, and said to her that our baby can't have any milk (it was told multiple time to her by me and my husband that our baby has galactosemia and that it can't have milk)\nI went to the shower and after 10 minutes I heard my baby crying, so I quickly rinsed off and ran to the living room where my baby was and mother in law. She was sitting there and feeding my baby. So I came up to her and said: \"oh you are already feeding the baby, thank you\"\nShe said: \"yeah he is really hungry, you can go and do your things, I'm feeding him some milk, because you don't give him any, and I thought it would be good for him.\"\nI looked at her like a deer in the headlights, for few seconds I froze and then yanked the bottle out of her hands. She started yelling at me and saying what the hell am I doing. I grabbed my baby and also started yelling at her to get the fuck out. \nI kicked her out and called my husband, I told him everything and he was just furious. He called him mom and told that she is not welcomed at out house anymore, because she knew that our baby can't have milk.\nWe had horrible night, our baby was vomiting and having diarrhea, but thankfully he didn't drink a lot of milk so it wasn't really bad.\nShe was calling us the whole night, but we didn't answer any calls and we are not planning to answer he any time soon. But my husband's grandmother called us and said that we were too cruel for kicking her out and she didn't mean any harm to our baby. She knew really well that our baby can't have any milk and she still gave him milk, but still AITA for kicking her out?", "created_utc": 1690362694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a0i7z/aita_for_kicking_out_my_mother_in_law_for_feeding/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

WTF is wrong with her?!", "NTA, your baby\u2019s health is the most important thing and if your MIL can\u2019t respect that, then it\u2019s good you kicked her out. You explained to her what to feed your baby and why you have to do that and she still didn\u2019t seem to care. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s just a preference, it\u2019s a life threatening illness and it\u2019s incredibly selfish and dangerous of her to ignore you. \n\nI\u2019d personally be very cautious having her around your baby again after this, she doesn\u2019t seem to respect you or your rules. Don\u2019t let her back in until she apologises and understands what she did was wrong", "Nta of course. She seriously harmed your Baby.", "NTA you clearly and repeatedly warned her that the baby cant have milk or will get sick, she gave the kid milk anyway, she either ignored you which makes her a asshole, or is to stupid to remember and shouldnt be around vulnerable kids anyway", "NTA. It's your child's health and comfort that she disregarded at your explicit instruction. Is kicking her out harsh? yes. But what rational person would want someone in their home who's complete disobediance to simple instruction had their baby shooting off from both ends?", "Just plain milk is horrible for any one month old, not just one with special needs - NTA and she should be on a massive timeout.", "Actually, you would be an AH if you did not kick her out.  Your MIL is willfully ignorant & put your baby's health at risk.  Please take your son to the doctor to establish a paper trail.  This may be necessary if your jurisdiction has grandparent's rights and your MIL tries to obtain access via the courts.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Every time the baby cries and is sick because of what MIL did, call both her and the grandmother. Video calls, pics, just really let them know how badly she's f-cked u. She's a safety hazard now.", "I would have done the same thing. If my I tell someone my child can\u2019t have something, whether it\u2019s for a medical reason or just because I don\u2019t want them to have it, and they go ahead and still give it to my kid they\u2019re 100% getting booted out of my house or won\u2019t be interacting with my child anymore. If a parent tells you not to give something to their child then don\u2019t give it to that child. Regardless of the reason for it. You are NTA OP.", "NTA NTA NTA what kind of grandma gives a baby something they've been told by a licensed professional doctor they can't have?? Nope nope nope NTA I hope you only posted this to get backup from the internet how awful she is, and you don't actually think you're the ah for protecting your baby. Also suuuper glad to hear your hubby didn't take mommy dearest side over his kid, that's a relief of it's own. Nah, girl, you're good - a good mamma too!", "NTA MIL harmed and endangered your kid. You\u2019re right for kicking her out and going no contact", "NTA. You did the right thing. Kids safety has to come before all else. You are the parents and ultimately responsible for that. When you allow a grand parent the privilege of caring for the infant, give the grand parent clear instructions regarding the care of the infant and then the grand parent for whatever reason chooses to ignore those instructions, putting the baby in danger, then it's time to ban the grandparent for caring for the kid.

Your poor kid\u2026 I think you were totally right to kick her out.  \n\nDo you know what on earth possessed her to give him milk? I mean, you shouldn\u2019t give normal milk to any newborn, but you both especially told her about your songs medical condition. So do you think she deliberately went against you? Does she have some issue understanding or with paying attention or with memory? I just don\u2019t understand how she could do that to her grandson.", "Nta.

Read your comment about her being from soviet and I can understand where she is coming from with the cow milk idea, because my grandma also often told me stories how common it was, that back then when breastfeading wasn't possible they gave the babies cow or goat milk and they did adapt and survive. But you literally told her minutes before how your baby has to be fed and that it can't have normal milk because it will get sick from it. This is beyond stupid.

But if anything happens again, then we will take action", "She was born in ex soviet union country, and back then a lot of people thought that giving your baby cows milk is good for the baby.

She probably ignored it and thought that she know better", "Thank you!

I may have spent too much time on reddit but I would still advise you to inform anyone who has to take care of your baby (nannies, family members, kindergarten later on, etc. ) to not let your mother close, as she may try and pick up your kid when you are not near.", "Here's the thing... you say \"if anything happens again\" you'll take further action. You have two clear choices IMO. You either take that action now, or you never let her near your child again. Because \"if anything happens again\", then you are the one who allowed that to happen to your baby. \n\nYour MIL didn't accidentally do this. She purposefully went against your instructions (and doctor's instructions!) because she thought she knew better than everyone.

I hate that you ever had to second guess this, even for a moment. IF you ever let gm back in the picture, which you'd be well within your means not to, you def shouldn't let her be unsupervised. She broke your trust already. For the future tho, since you mentioned something about her growing up in a different culture, you may could provide her with a doctor's explanation of why milk is bad for the baby, so she at least may come to realize how wrong her actions were. I still wouldn't just trust her again, personally, but I'd want her to see and understand I wasn't overreacting about why that wasn't ok. Alot of older folks don't seem to grasp how the world has changed, or that just because something was normal growing up doesn't make it safe or good for kids now...", "I\u2019m sorry it has to go to that level.  It\u2019s not like she snuck a sucker with a 5 year old; she could cause severe neurological problems (and the aforementioned gastrointestinal problems).  May I ask, is it PKU?", "Wow, that\u2019s really tough OP. Sounds as though she\u2019s deliberately ignored your instructions, and important medical information. I think keeping your distance is the right thing. Hopefully in time she will realise how bad a mistake she made. Best of luck to you and your family.", "I hope this situation won't get worst, thankfully we don't have many relatives, from husband's side are his mom, grandmother and grandfather, from my side its just my dad. After what his grandmother told me I don't have any trust in her either. We haven't left our child to anyone, because I'm always home. But if I will have to I probably will leave him with a professional nanny, that know her job, and even still I will be terrified that something will go wrong.", "Thank you! You are absolutely right about all of this.", "Thank you! And thank you for making me laugh also, I will tell my husband that his mother is ostrich \ud83e\udd23", "I think everything will be fine, thank you for your concerns. And no it's not phenylketonuria. My baby has galactosemia, his body can't break down galactose so it builds up in his blood to toxic levels. So he can't even have my breast milk, not only milk (or other dairy products) and most of the baby formulas on the market", "Again, thank you! I think my husband has it the worst because not only his child was put at risk, but also his own mother did this.
