We live together, I'm right now staying home with our baby, and my husband works all day (he is taking more hours to earn more money, because we want to move to a bigger house).\nSo the whole day I need to watch out child, do house work, cook dinner, then when my husband (who is also exhausted from work) comes from work and takes over the care of our baby, so I could at least shower and eat something. \nAnd the worst thing is that our baby has galactosemia (it gets diagnosed in first days after being born, doctors take baby's blood from the heel and send ir to the laboratory. And that test came positive). So our baby needs special formula, if he will eat my breast milk or ather milks it will have life long consequences ( development delays, cataract, speech delay, kidney diseases and many more), and baby will be vomiting, will become lethargic, will have diarrhea and many other symptoms.\nAfter some time my husband's mother suggested that she would come and help us for few days and we agreed. So after few days she came, husband was still at work. So we started talking, we never had like good relationship ship, but we respected each other.\nThen after some talking she said that I should take a shower and she will look after our baby. I showed her where is baby formula and told her how to make it, and said to her that our baby can't have any milk (it was told multiple time to her by me and my husband that our baby has galactosemia and that it can't have milk)\nI went to the shower and after 10 minutes I heard my baby crying, so I quickly rinsed off and ran to the living room where my baby was and mother in law. She was sitting there and feeding my baby. So I came up to her and said: \"oh you are already feeding the baby, thank you\"\nShe said: \"yeah he is really hungry, you can go and do your things, I'm feeding him some milk, because you don't give him any, and I thought it would be good for him.\"\nI looked at her like a deer in the headlights, for few seconds I froze and then yanked the bottle out of her hands. She started yelling at me and saying what the hell am I doing. I grabbed my baby and also started yelling at her to get the fuck out. \nI kicked her out and called my husband, I told him everything and he was just furious. He called him mom and told that she is not welcomed at out house anymore, because she knew that our baby can't have milk.\nWe had horrible night, our baby was vomiting and having diarrhea, but thankfully he didn't drink a lot of milk so it wasn't really bad.\nShe was calling us the whole night, but we didn't answer any calls and we are not planning to answer he any time soon. But my husband's grandmother called us and said that we were too cruel for kicking her out and she didn't mean any harm to our baby.

The word for giving someone something they know will make them sick is \u201cpoisoning.\u201d Maybe point that out when you get grief about this again.", "NTA.\n\nWhat is it with people giving children foods/drinks that they've been told they're allergic to? I just don't get the twisted logic there. You told her your child needs formula and she gives him milk after being told *specifically* that the baby can't have it? Frankly I'd be giving Granny a serve as well: that yes, she did mean harm because she's done the *one thing* she was told *not* to do.\n\nDon't let MIL come back. She's endangered your child's health and has shown she can't be trusted. Can you press charges for child endangerment while you're at it, really drive the point home?\n\nAh. Seriously. I want to yell at your MIL now. Absolutely unhinged!", "NTA - I genuinely don\u2019t understand how someone can tell people (especially family) about a medical condition and they\u2019ll still find a way to try and delegitimize it just because they think they know more than you. You did what was right for your baby, and that\u2019s what matters.", "NTA  \n\n\nOMG. Is your MIL merely incredibly stupid, or is  she simply conceited enough to think that she knows better than the medics?", "NTA Whoa! I was livid reading this and I don\u2019t you. That mother should be banned from unsupervised time with the baby. You both told her about the allergy to baby milk and the consequences if the baby drank it. And she still gave the baby milk.", "Ah, great, she poisoned your baby. I would never let her near my child ever again.", "NTA.  I think glactosemia is akin to CMPA where I live and I have several friends whose babies have had it, so I've seen first hand how bad things can get.  You were quite explicit as to the issues your baby has and WHY the baby cannot have milk - not just once, but several times.  She proceeded to trample over your boundaries (and those of the medical profession) and give the baby milk anyway, leading to said baby being poorly.  I'd have thrown her out as well.", "NTA so not only had she been told about baby\u2019s health issues previously but legit minutes before giving him milk? Being grandma doesn\u2019t automatically mean she knows better.", "I shit you not I would press charges.", "NTA.  Lord knows I've made plenty of mistakes raising my kids, but at least when someone told me I was wrong I listened!  She endangered your child.  I doubt she meant any harm but still, you're the parents, what the baby eats is for you to decide, not her.", "Info: does she have dementia or some other cognitive impairment? \n\nObviously, NTA either way. If she truly meant no harm than something is seriously wrong with her. If nothing is wrong with her than it was intentional and malicious.", ">she didn't mean any harm to our baby.\n\nNeglect is almost as bad as intentionally causing harm.", "NTA - you literally saved your baby and MIL endangered it. Heavy vomiting and diarrhea is deadly for such a tiny body.", "NTA, and even infants without galactosemia should not have any cow's milk until 12 months of age.", "Just to offer a counter point here cows milk has been amazing for babies and to be avoided at all costs over the past decades of infant care same with stomach or back to sleep..... its not inherent that cows milk is bad, and along with goat milk was used all the time to supplement feeding in the past......\n\n   Your still NTA and ml needs to respect your rules wishes and boundaries !! Before going absolutely crazy though remember she may have thought she was helping because her upbringing could be very different from yours!", "Under a year for everyone is a bit of an overstatement. Some kids at my daycare had special requests from doctors or even just mom or dad to start milk as early as 6 months. But absolutely not a 1 month old", "NTA - There's nothing in here that could ever possibly make you the AH!", "Thank you! Could you tell me please about the coconut oil story, I never heard of that", "My sympathies also go out to your strong family and your beautiful and also strong daughter.

This is a good one.\ud83e\udd23 but in all seriousness I am sure that grandma will not be a part of our child's life", "Thank you! Galactosemia is when persons body can't break down galactose and it ends up in persons blood, and it can reach toxic levels if person drank too much milk or ate dairy products . It is not an allergen and is not in the same relm as the as the lactose intolerance.", "Thank you! We will let her know everything and that she can't even be close to our child", "Thank you! That's why we will not be giving her or GMI chances. They showed us what they are capable of, and that is harming our baby and ignoring simple instructions", "Thank you! Our baby is now doing great, he is doing his baby things (pooping, eating and crying\ud83e\udd23)", "God now I am really thinking about this, that she probably really purposely made me leave the room to give him milk... I hope it's not like this", "Thank you! You are 100% right", "Thank you! You are the second person that is talking about this coconut oil story. I live under a rock, can you please tell me what happened?", "No, she is perfectly healthy, has no memory disorder, and has no psychological disorders too. Only if she never went to the doctors to get diagnosed, but she always seemed fine to me.", "Thank you! We are all doing fine now", "Thank you!", "Thank you! I will not step down on what I think is right", "Yes indeed, but we also used to powder our faces with arsenic and put cocaine in cough syrup!!!! As a species we develop and discover new things and your baby cannot have something why would you deliberately go against the parents and doctors? That is so wrong. I\u2019m glad your baby is ok.", "Regardless, you told her NO, if nothing else it's  an issue of respect even without the health consequences", "No, she wasn't, because she had already been told milk was dangerous.", "Have you asked her to explain herself? I cannot think of a single reason why, but ask her at least to attempt to explain herself. Ask her explicitly if she did not mean to harm the baby why did she do something that she explicitly knew would harm the baby? You obviously won't get a satisfying answer, but it may give her an opportunity for some self-reflection, and maybe, just maybe, some small change. If this woman is going to be part of your babies future at all, you need to start getting her to rethink how she behaves.", "She didn\u2019t care she wanted\nTo hurt the baby.", "oh that explains alot!", "Doesn't matter. You'd already told her.", "We have better options now. Cow and goat milk are both superior to starvation, but modern formula is superior to both.", "[removed]", "That's the problem.  The baby doesnt have health problems NOW. \n\nGlactosemia children lack the GALT enzyme to break down glactose.  So when galactose is introduced into the system it builds up and poisons the child over time. \n\nYou won't see immediate effects but your MIL just did severe long term damage to your child. \n\nSource:  I have a child with Duarte Glactosemia and have participated in several research studies.", "You are not the only one! I had to have a conversation with my MIL because she kept give our 2 yo cola. Parents are the only ones who should determine what their child eats (and the doctor of course) NTA.", "Yeah you hear that way to often! And some babys were not fine back then and also didn't survive, I'm glad modern medicine has come this far and the heel blood test and other important things exist.", "That's survivor's bias. Measles is a good example, most people survived but some didn't, and the survivors weren't all fine. Many had permanent damage to their eyesight or hearing. Helen Keller got the way she was (deaf and blind) because of what was at the time a routine \"harmless\" and expected childhood illness", "It's so so sad, warning it ends with the death of a child. I don't even really want to explain the story, but if you google \"reddit coconut oil allergy\" it'll pop up.", "I thought of that story too. Basically the family was from a region where it's traditional to use coconut oil for hair care. Granddaughter had a coconut allergy, grandmother was upset her daughter wasn't caring for granddaughter in the traditional way.

You will never be an asshole because you protected your child from harm.", "Even if she had her head in the sand the entire time: OP explicitly said the baby couldn't have milk and that it would make the baby ill.

Its funny how mad people get at basic differences of opinions", "Thank you! Tomorrow we will see our family doctor and tell her the situation. I think that my baby didn't drink a lot of milk (it's still not ok to give any amount). He is doing great now, and I think everything will be OK with him. But I'm off corse still concerned with my child's health even though he didn't have a lot of milk.", "I just can't understand why some grandparents are so determined to give kind what they can't have. Cola to a 2 year old is just crazy", "I absolutely agree with you, the sheer ignorance of a lot of old people is just mind blowing. It's so sad to see that they don't want to change their believes just because they grew up with it, and think that they are right. There will be zero trust towards MIL and GIL", "On no. That is just horrible. I probably won't be able to read it because I will be imaging that it was my son. Poor baby", "I'm so Happy for you and you daughter, I wish you all the best!", "Tell grandmother that it doesn't take intent to harm a baby, just not following explicit orders.
