In September, my daughter (2.5mo) had her first family outing at her cousin\u2019s (1F) birthday party. Historically, I have had issues controlling my anxiety, and although I am not taking any medications for it right now and I am still experiencing PPA, I feel it is much more controlled than it has been in the past. Because of this, I prefaced our outing by discussing my anxiety with my husband and telling him that I was anxious about a few specific things. I knew some unnamed sickness was going around because our niece, the birthday girl, had something a few days before, so I did not want our daughter to get sick. I told him I would be uncomfortable asking his family to do/not do certain things, and they would likely take it better coming from him, and he agreed: I handle my family and he handles his. So I asked him if we could 1. Keep the kids away from her, or at least make sure to wipe her hands frequently, and 2. Adhere to the \u201cno kissing the baby\u201d rule. He agreed. \n\nFast forward to the party, I give my husband our child so I can go to the bathroom, and I return to find her in my MIL\u2019s arms. Not a problem, but she disappeared for a while (also not a problem, she\u2019s very trustworthy) and came back showing me and my husband photos of the kids holding our daughter. My husband avoided eye contact with me. It was one of those things I just tried not to overthink and I didn\u2019t want to argue about it, so I took our daughter from my MIL and cleaned her hands and face (just in case). Later, my husband stayed visiting with his family while I took our daughter to a quiet room to feed and change her. When I returned, his cousin\u2019s wife wanted to hold her, and I handed her over without hesitation. Before I went to grab myself food, I whispered to my husband, \u201cPlease make sure nobody kisses her.\u201d For the rest of the evening, my husband was giving me the cold shoulder, and I really didn\u2019t know why. \n\nTonight, (three weeks later), I was telling him that when we see my extended family next weekend, we will have to make sure they do not kiss our daughter. He exploded on me, saying that I pissed him off at the party (weeks ago!) and treated him like he\u2019s incompetent by asking him to not let his family hold our child. He said that while I was absent at the party, he and his cousins were discussing that it is \u201csick season\u201d and how dangerous it is to kiss babies, and I acted like they were all stupid and incapable by asking him to keep an eye on our baby while they held her. I responded to him by explaining that 1. I was not there for that conversation, so how could I have been meaning it that way? 2. I fully intend to hold my family members to the same standards when we see them. And 3. We agreed on our \u201crules\u201d before the party, one of which he did not even ask his mother to adhere to. I feel like his anger towards me is confusing. My intentions are clearly to protect our child, but now I\u2019m wondering if I overdid it.

You don\u2019t save grievances to use as ammunition later.", "NTA. I think your concerns are valid.", "NTA in general\n\nYour concerns were reasonable. Some of the viruses currently floating around could put your baby in the hospital, and baby was in a home with a one year old who'd recently been sick. \n\nSome people might have even said no to the visit since the birthday child could still be contagious. (Tell THAT to your husband! You are not even among the \"super-worried\" group.)\n\nMaybe you were a little repetitive in your concern, but your husband by this time should get how important it is to you and your natural inclinations. He took it as insulting to his family when he should have taken it as knowing his wife.\n\nHe was way out of line to get nasty with you. You weren't insulting his family though he thinks you were because he's a bit of an AH. He needs to take more time to understand your thinking. He doesn't.", "Look, there's a lot of different AITA aspects here. \n\nAt the end of the day, you are worried about your young infant's health and that is absolutely legitimate. I had a 31 week preemie, believe me, I understand. \n\nBut you're trying to establish and enforce rules limiting contact with your baby while taking her to large family gatherings. That just doesn't work, unless you're going to hold the baby every minute. And even then she's going to be breathing the same air and you're still going to have to deal with some potentially awkward conversations. Family events are very challenging. \n\nYou would be far better off spending time with your families/friends only in very small groups instead of setting yourselves up in these high pressure no win big events. It's way easier to insist that all visitors have to be healthy. Everyone can hold the baby and it can just feel like a normal visit without rules and anxiety. At least until she's 4-6 months or so and her immune system is more developed and you guys are more settled into being parents. \n\nNAH. You're both stressed new parents trying to do the right thing.", "NTA. Keeping a newborn from getting sick is your job. Turns out your MIL isn\u2019t as trustworthy as you thought. Your husband should have had your back. If he wants to pout, ignore him. He\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA. What????? You are the mother and you can choose if you want your baby to be kissed or not. The father is doing too much acting like you're putting the baby in a hazmat suit. Good job for keeping the baby safe as babies can EASILY get sick.", "NTA but this is such a disproportionate reaction that I wonder what the bigger issue is. Give him some time to cool down and revisit this when everyone is clear headed. There's definitely more underneath this", "Ok, you're the mom and you can set the rules you want. But if you dont want people to hold or kiss the baby, just don't go. NAH.", "Your husband cannot be trusted and I would avoid any large family gatherings until she is around 6 months old or so. He had no right to blow up at you, it shows he is emotionally immature.
