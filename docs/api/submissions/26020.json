For reference, a group of four is in the same seats on the other side of the aisle, and they are zigzagging knees, with no table. My partner checked the rules for sitting in that section as a group of less than four, and they do allow for \u201ctwo or more people.\u201d On the other end of the car, there are two pairs of accessible seats (two on each side of the aisle), with extra room in front for storing mobility aids, etc.\n\nA couple stops later, a middle-aged couple with an elderly lady in a wheelchair/holding a cane gets on. It didn\u2019t occur to me that they would want this section, with more suitable seats available.\n\nThe adult daughter in the group started shoving her bags into the compartment over us. At that point, a random man (who must have been stuck behind them) started lecturing us about how the group across from us was a family like this new one, and we should move. The elderly woman asked if she could sit in the seat across from me, so we said of course; however her knees were squished into mine and she had to hold her cane to the side.\n\nI explained that there were accessible seats on the other end of the same car and she would be able to have her mobility aids right in front of her, because there is extra room in front of the seats. I offered to walk back and ensure they were still available/possibly help move any able-bodied people from them. My spiel was ignored, and the rando continued to state how unfair we were being. My partner, who later told me he sensed the group was just looking to argue, and in an attempt to end arguing, simply stated \u201cI am not moving.\u201d\n\nRando then started ranting \u201cit\u2019s unbelievable how y\u2019all are only looking out for yourselves,\u201d but imo we were doing the opposite! I actually think it\u2019s really gross that they were trying to use their disabled family member to guilt us into moving out of seats they wanted when it wasn\u2019t what was best for her (to be fair, I don\u2019t know her exact diagnoses, but I am a trained healthcare worker who has worked in hospitals with that population). I also feel so bad for this poor granny, who was probably mortified, especially with her family talking about her like she isn\u2019t there.\n\nMeanwhile, the husband was off whispering with the train staff and pointing at us. When the staff arrived, I asked him if the accessible seats were available, and if not could they be made so. The staff member stated \u201call four are free\u201d and backed us up with getting the family moved over there.\n\nThe adult daughter complained that the train was moving, so they would have to wait to move her until it was still at the next stop 40 minutes away\u2014which wouldn\u2019t have been an issue if they had just kept going down the train car when we first tried to talk with them instead of arguing and causing a scene.\n\nSo, are we TA?", "created_utc": 1693574219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1676wfu/aita_for_refusing_to_move_seats_on_a_train/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I thought it was super weird because Amtrak literally had three different ways to make sure that disabled people can sit where they need to be, AND they include family members in those accommodations to be with them!\n\nWhy did they have no clue what to do or about the existence of disabled seating, and why did they leave poor granny alone? I ended up being the one to hold her hand and help her get up!\n\nAnd yeah at first I thought the rando was just upset because he was stuck behind them but then he doubled down and I was like who even are you", "Absolutely\u2014that would have been a different story entirely. If the disabled seats were already taken by other disabled people, of course we would have moved. I will say, if they were occupied by able-bodied people, they should be the ones to move, but if they were horrible and wouldn\u2019t, we still would have moved as well", "NTA. You were already there", "NTA\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, there has yet to be a case of an adult spontaneously combusting because they weren\u2019t sitting within hand-holding distance of a travelling companion on a bus, train or plane.\n\nThey had a perfectly good option available to them if they had wanted to sit together."]}
