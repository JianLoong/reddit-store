You need to properly communicate with Ally about how you're feeling and try to resolve it before you lose the friendship all together. This is a good life skill to develop early. If you don't let people know how you're feeling and why you're upset, then it leaves them guessing and opens up the potential for them to resent you for treating them coldly (as we see here with Ally's response to you). You're currently radiating an energy that you don't like, and that your friends don't like, either. This isn't a good solution for anyone and won't lead to anything good. If you want to be friends with these people, you need to make an effort...perhaps even more of an effort than they're making. Rather than getting upset with them for leaving you out, what if you tried in earnest to suggest things that would include all 3 of you?", "I'm not sure how to judge this. I wanted to say NTA, but then you are doing some passive aggressive crap so that leads into YTA territory. \r  \n\r  \nFrom where I'm sitting, it sounds like you don't really like Ally and only hang out with her because you really like Ethan. She sounds like she needs to be in charge and get her way, such as sitting in the middle all the time so she gets Ethan to herself. But on the other hand, you admitted to being cold to her and ignoring her and she's certainly picked on up this and it's causing strife. \r  \n\r  \nIt sounds to me like you need to branch out and find some new friends in addition to these two. Yes that is easier said than done of course, but you could join a club, start participating in other group activities, basically anything so you can start to meet new people. They were a duo before you came along and best friends, teens have a hard time letting others into their little friend group.  \r  \n\r  \nFor the record, yes, this is a bit of a teenagery problem but this is also your life and happening right now, so obviously important to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Can you widen your social circle by making some additional friends?", "ESH is perfect for this one, being passive aggressive just leads to more immaturity down the line. Be mature, act responsible and explain, after that if they dismiss you, walk away.", "Thank you for responding \u2764\ufe0f How should i bring it up though? i feel like they might just respond by saying how they\u2019ve known each other for so long that obviously they\u2019re closer.", "I'm excited for them. I hope they do this and get better and better at navigating this kinda thing. Choose maturity OP!", "It's hard to answer that because I can't really pinpoint the behavior that's hurting you. If i's just that they are closer, that's not something they are doing wrong or you can do anything about that. Apart from remembering that this doesn't mean they don't like you.\n\nIf you feel like Ally isn't being kind to you as a friend, I'd say approach it generally with something like. 'Hey, sometimes I feel things are a bit tense between us and I'm wondering if there's anything we can do to mend things'.\n\nTry your hardest to be open to hearing what Ally has to say too without being defensive. It's possible there are things frustrating her too."]}
