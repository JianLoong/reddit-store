Really this is the type of discussion that should happen before moving in together.", "YTA.  You do need office space.  However, your need for gaming space is NOT more important than her need for a private space.\n\nYour attitude is troubling.

If I knew her, I'd be telling her there are red flags all over this situation.\n\nI don't know if there's a solution here--whether you can move to a place with another spare room or that would waste too much money.

You are either in a partnership with this person or you are not.\n\nIf you're unhappy with the living expenses, then come to a different arrangement. Live somewhere that you can both afford 50/50 and keep it professional based on the money.\n\nWhat isn't cool is to come to an arrangement where you pay more and she does more, and then hold the money over her head after the fact. You've both already agreed that an 80/20 rent split and a 80/20 chore split is the way you're going to live together. You can't leverage that against her to command more of the space you share.\n\nThe situation has no assholes, both of you have a legitmate need for private space. But how you've responded makes you an asshole as you're belittling how she spends her time and are leveraging a financial arrangement that you've both already agreed to against her. That's the path towards the death of your relationship, guarunteed. \n\nI'd apologize to her for framing the issue that way and start over in your efforts to find the best way to use your shared space.", "INFO: why don't you set up a corner in the office with a reading chair and lamp or something like that? If she doesn't work at home she won't be there while you're working and I don't see a problem with you playing and her reading in the same room.\n\nI think you keep thinking of it as your house instead of both your house, which makes you YTA", "No but you.might want to consider moving somewhere bigger or a new gf. As an avid reader I only need a comfy chair and my kindle lol but perhaps she has craft style hobbies.", "YTA - You\u2019re just dismissing a valid request. The bedroom is not a private space and you know it. You clearly understand the importance of one having a little space for themselves but you refuse to acknowledge that this applies to her as well.\n\nYou need office space while working, yes, but you don\u2019t need \u201cgaming space\u201d as well. If you two are serious about this relationship then you should be sharing that second room after work hours. It can be her space to read after your work day is done, or you two can split the afterwork hours in that room.\n\nBesides, she moved into your apartment, meaning that she will always subconsciously feel like this is your apartment and she is intruding or overstepping unless you make a lot of effort to prove to her that the place is just as much hers as it is yours. You having a second room that you don\u2019t share with her is the opposite of doing that. Big time YTA.", "NTA. It being a work from home space makes this automatic. She can read a book anywhere. If she wants her own office she can rent one in an office building or strip mall.", "NTA for maintaining your space to work from home. Which she benefits from as you pay the majority of the bills, otherwise you would be like many couples and live in a 1 bedroom.\n\nAnd it seems rather silly to rent a 3 bedroom so you have his and her spaces, so I cannot support that.", "NTA. You need the office for work because you work from home.", "NTA/YTA", "NTA.", "NTA. You need it for work plus you pay more for rent so you're essentially paying to rent that room too. If you split rent and utilities 50/50 and only you got an extra room, that would be unfair. \n\nHowever, I'm assuming your girlfriend works because you mention her salary? Do you both work equal hours or do you work full-time while she works part-time? I'm asking because chores should not be divided by money earned. If you're both working similar hours, she should not be doing the majority of the chores. She's not an indentured servant. You each should get equal free time and should each be contributing to the upkeep of your home.", "I generally agree, but it would be generous of him to help her pay (within some reasonable budget) to redecorate their shared rooms. As it is, while she works fairly similar hours to him but for less money (and her commute likely adds in some time as well), it sounds a bit unfair that she's doing the majority of the chores while he games after work.", "I can tell you read Dr. Seuss as. Child. \ud83d\ude0a", "You mean equitable isn't equality? LOL We mostly all get there at some point.", "I actually told her do that. Convert living room into 2 space and put blind or sliders but she declined that and as for 3 bedroom it's out of her budget", "My wife made me a \"book nook\" by doing this for my birthday and I was tickled pink", "Wrong. It\u2019s reasonable for her to WANT a reading/misc room but it\u2019s not feasible given the setup. She can wait. When the budget allows they can buy or rent a condo with 3 bedrooms", "We have entire bedroom for her private space", "She does most of the chores because her job takes 6-7 hrs while my job takes 8-9 hrs.", "Yes, he does need an office space. If he works from home, he needs a space relatively free from noise, and where he can turn on the camera if his job demands it. WFH does not necessarily mean \"employed within reasonable commuting distance\" so you shouldn't assume this a luxury.\n\nI'd say this is a NAH - she needs to realize that the home office is literally how they can afford the roof over her head. She's entitled to want a private space, but there isn't one available. They should probably discuss what moving to a larger apartment looks like budget-wise.", "So her need for private space outweighs his need for private space ?  How does that work exactly?", "Why did you edited your original text\ud83e\udd14", "OP said the office was 7x8 feet, which sounds more like a closet than a bedroom. If the size is true, I think even a desk and chair is a tight fit.", "Yeah...fuck no.  \n\nI work remotely and have for 4 years. There is no way in hell I could (or would) allow someone free range of my office like that.", "The office and gaming space are the same and it's a small room", "I mean it would be generous, but it\u2019s not like he has todo it. The way she has an issue with his valid use of space seems like she\u2019ll have more requests. Also the division of house work is their business, if he\u2019s paying 85% of expenses for example and she agreed todo most of the chores then that\u2019s their prerogative.", "Majority means she does most of the cooking/dishes and i do most of the cleaning/laundry but cleaning a space with two functioning adults is not a big time taker so that's why I said she does most of the chores.", "I didn't say it needs to be an entire room, just a space.", "Even if she decorates it, that is still a shared space.  This isn't something that has a concise solution.  You 2 just have to work it out.", "Do you sleep in that bedroom?", "That's not a major difference but if you want to split things up in terms of how much time you both spend working, then it's up to both of you.\n\nWhat is interesting is that you're fixated on making sure she works every minute that you're working--but you still expect to have a private room for gaming during your free time.\n\nWhat you're saying is that what's hers is yours--her time where she works shorter hours than you.  And what's yours is yours--\"your\" room, even after you've finished working for the day.\n\nYou're sharing a living space and if you want to do that without ending up with a resentful girlfriend, you need to learn to actually share.  There are all kinds of ways to sort this out so that the situation is fair.  For example, designating the room as your office during the work day and then sharing it somehow at other times.  Moving.  Designating one room as the living room and bedroom and turning the other one over to her.  \n\nRight now, you expect to have everything to suit you and that only works when you're living alone and inviting a girlfriend over, not when you're living with her.", "That first paragraph is what I said.  Did you read my post?  I made three different suggestions and you have not addressed any of them because--like the OP--you WANT him to be right and to have a room to himself while the girlfriend has no private space.", "Read it again.  That's not what I said.  Good try!", "I forget but it would have been a typo.  I'm sick and keep seeing that I have typed the wrong word.  Why do you care?  Looking for another reason to avoid dealing with what I said?", "Yes. That room is 7\u00d78, one side of wall is cover by my entire desk and one side is with all electronics I have.", "I work from home as well. From the moment work ends it's no longer the office, it's the gaming/leisure room. Why can't it be that for both of them?\n\nThe gf isn't home while he's working, so it's not a matter of she being there while he's working.", "The office space is during work hours. After that it becomes a gaming space which he can easily allow his partner to use since it\u2019s her apartment as well.", "It\u2019s a pretty difficult situation. So to placate his partner he needs to pay a majority of the rent for a larger place so she can read? That seems like the only solution if she can\u2019t read in their bedroom (which they probably decorated together) or in their living room while he\u2019s in the office. That doesn\u2019t really seem fair since OPs space is where he works to generate the income to pay a majority of their bills. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s just his video game room or anything.", "Do you sleep", "I hope u did read the part where I wrote that room is 7\u00d78.", "First, you don't know me, so don't presume to know my intentions. I get that reading the tea leaves to pretend to pull some fictional scenario out of thin air is a popular pastime here, but I have no taste for it.\n\nSecond, you have proposed one solution, and OP has stated elsewhere that a larger apartment is out of the question. I concede I misread your initial point.\n\nFinally, he's paying 80% of the bills. So yes, the expectation that she pick up more of the house chores is not unreasonable. If she was contributing closer to 50/50, hell even 60/40 in OPs favor, you might have had a point. But you seem to think OP owes her space in an apartment he was paying for before meeting her, giving up a space he had set aside that funds their current lifestyle, and that he shouldn't ask for any concessions on sharing the domestic workload, despite him paying the overwhelming majority of the expenses.\n\nPerhaps you should consider rereading the OP and reexamining your preconceptions.", "Defensive and plain wrong. What a killer combo!", "You removed a paragraph of accusing me of being a red flag so I was just wondering what happened.", "The room is tiny so it would be much better to just seperated a zone in the living room", "I didn't say she should get it, just it was reasonable to want it.  Just because their wants/needs don't work together right now doesn't make either the ass.", "You can still share the room after work hours while still having only one person in there.", "Good try!  How does that matter?  Schedule time in the room.  Try one of my other suggestions.  \n\nYour attitude is going to torpedo this relationship.  You might think you're \"winning\" because you can hold your higher salary over her head or because she doesn't want to look for another place to live so soon after moving in.  However, you're setting the relationship up to be unhappy.  These issues can poison a relationship.  Take the advice or leave it.", "And you still can't explain yourself or understand what I said.", "No I didn't.  No idea what you're talking about.  Look at the comment further up in the thread.  I do say that there are red flags all over this situation.  I absolutely think that!  She should leave.\n\nI have told you what I think.  If you want to have an unhappy relationship, you will keep doing what you're doing.  What you're doing right now is also a red flag.  I, however, am going to mute you and get on with my life!  Goodbye.", "They don\u2019t have to both be in there at the same time. They can share the room to have private space on like a schedule or something outside of work hours.", "You gave shit advice, you got downvoted to the pit and now also got trolled lmao\ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
