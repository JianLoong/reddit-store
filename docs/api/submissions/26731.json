You've both already agreed that an 80/20 rent split and a 80/20 chore split is the way you're going to live together.

If you two are serious about this relationship then you should be sharing that second room after work hours. It can be her space to read after your work day is done, or you two can split the afterwork hours in that room.\n\nBesides, she moved into your apartment, meaning that she will always subconsciously feel like this is your apartment and she is intruding or overstepping unless you make a lot of effort to prove to her that the place is just as much hers as it is yours. You having a second room that you don\u2019t share with her is the opposite of doing that. Big time YTA.", "NTA. It being a work from home space makes this automatic. She can read a book anywhere.

If you split rent and utilities 50/50 and only you got an extra room, that would be unfair. \n\nHowever, I'm assuming your girlfriend works because you mention her salary? Do you both work equal hours or do you work full-time while she works part-time? I'm asking because chores should not be divided by money earned. If you're both working similar hours, she should not be doing the majority of the chores. She's not an indentured servant. You each should get equal free time and should each be contributing to the upkeep of your home.", "I generally agree, but it would be generous of him to help her pay (within some reasonable budget) to redecorate their shared rooms.

If he works from home, he needs a space relatively free from noise, and where he can turn on the camera if his job demands it. WFH does not necessarily mean \"employed within reasonable commuting distance\" so you shouldn't assume this a luxury.\n\nI'd say this is a NAH - she needs to realize that the home office is literally how they can afford the roof over her head. She's entitled to want a private space, but there isn't one available.

The way she has an issue with his valid use of space seems like she\u2019ll have more requests. Also the division of house work is their business, if he\u2019s paying 85% of expenses for example and she agreed todo most of the chores then that\u2019s their prerogative.", "Majority means she does most of the cooking/dishes and i do most of the cleaning/laundry but cleaning a space with two functioning adults is not a big time taker so that's why I said she does most of the chores.", "I didn't say it needs to be an entire room, just a space.", "Even if she decorates it, that is still a shared space.  This isn't something that has a concise solution.  You 2 just have to work it out.", "Do you sleep in that bedroom?", "That's not a major difference but if you want to split things up in terms of how much time you both spend working, then it's up to both of you.\n\nWhat is interesting is that you're fixated on making sure she works every minute that you're working--but you still expect to have a private room for gaming during your free time.\n\nWhat you're saying is that what's hers is yours--her time where she works shorter hours than you.  And what's yours is yours--\"your\" room, even after you've finished working for the day.\n\nYou're sharing a living space and if you want to do that without ending up with a resentful girlfriend, you need to learn to actually share.  There are all kinds of ways to sort this out so that the situation is fair.  For example, designating the room as your office during the work day and then sharing it somehow at other times.  Moving.  Designating one room as the living room and bedroom and turning the other one over to her.  \n\nRight now, you expect to have everything to suit you and that only works when you're living alone and inviting a girlfriend over, not when you're living with her.", "That first paragraph is what I said.

After that it becomes a gaming space which he can easily allow his partner to use since it\u2019s her apartment as well.", "It\u2019s a pretty difficult situation. So to placate his partner he needs to pay a majority of the rent for a larger place so she can read? That seems like the only solution if she can\u2019t read in their bedroom (which they probably decorated together) or in their living room while he\u2019s in the office. That doesn\u2019t really seem fair since OPs space is where he works to generate the income to pay a majority of their bills. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s just his video game room or anything.", "Do you sleep", "I hope u did read the part where I wrote that room is 7\u00d78.", "First, you don't know me, so don't presume to know my intentions. I get that reading the tea leaves to pretend to pull some fictional scenario out of thin air is a popular pastime here, but I have no taste for it.\n\nSecond, you have proposed one solution, and OP has stated elsewhere that a larger apartment is out of the question. I concede I misread your initial point.\n\nFinally, he's paying 80% of the bills. So yes, the expectation that she pick up more of the house chores is not unreasonable. If she was contributing closer to 50/50, hell even 60/40 in OPs favor, you might have had a point. But you seem to think OP owes her space in an apartment he was paying for before meeting her, giving up a space he had set aside that funds their current lifestyle, and that he shouldn't ask for any concessions on sharing the domestic workload, despite him paying the overwhelming majority of the expenses.\n\nPerhaps you should consider rereading the OP and reexamining your preconceptions.", "Defensive and plain wrong. What a killer combo!", "You removed a paragraph of accusing me of being a red flag so I was just wondering what happened.", "The room is tiny so it would be much better to just seperated a zone in the living room", "I didn't say she should get it, just it was reasonable to want it.  Just because their wants/needs don't work together right now doesn't make either the ass.", "You can still share the room after work hours while still having only one person in there.", "Good try!  How does that matter?  Schedule time in the room.  Try one of my other suggestions.  \n\nYour attitude is going to torpedo this relationship.  You might think you're \"winning\" because you can hold your higher salary over her head or because she doesn't want to look for another place to live so soon after moving in.
