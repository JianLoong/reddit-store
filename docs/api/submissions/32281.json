My daughter's dad is Puerto Rican and Native American. My hair is straight and blonde and my ex's hair is black, coarse and frizzy/poofy. My daughter has a mixture of both of our hair. When it's longer, it becomes more straight and super easy to style. When it's short, it's nearly impossible to even brush through, let alone style. I've always had long hair but her dad and her grandmother think long hair is ugly. I mean, there was even a time back years ago where my exs mom insisted on \"cutting off my dead ends\" and told me she wouldn't cut it short (it was down to my ass) and she literally chopped it right below my shoulders and said \"oh that's so much better\" and got pissed at me for saying I hated it and would never let her touch my hair again. Needless to say, me and my ex broke up shortly after.\n\nFor years my daughter would go to visits and come home with her hair chopped off. If I made any comments about it, I was met with a \"she's my fucking kid too. You aren't the boss. What happens at my house is none of your business. You don't make the fucking rules.\" But 2 years ago my daughter started telling them she wanted to grow her hair out because she couldn't style her short hair without my help and we were both getting pissed off and short fused over having to wake up 1-2 hours earlier every morning just to brush through her hair and style it to a point where she didn't feel insecure at school. During that time they respected her wishes and didn't touch her hair.\n\nBut a month ago her grandmother and dad started bitching about her hair again. I made a point to tell them not to touch her hair without her permission because I have a newborn at home now and can't take 1-2 hours every morning to style her hair anymore. Well.. they convinced my daughter to chop off her hair this past weekend and sure enough, my daughter is in my room at 5:30am asking me to help her with her hair, while I'm nursing my newborn. I told her no. I had just started feeding the baby. She immediately flipped out. She said \"my grandmother said you should be taking time to do my hair and that you have 2 kids, not 1.\" I texted the grandmother and asked wtf she said to my kid and she said \"as a mom you need to prioritize both kids, not just the baby. Do your daughters fucking hair.\" I didn't do my kids hair. She is blaming me for feeling insecure at school now.\n\nETA: she told me she gave her grandmother permission to cut her hair. She cannot style it herself. She can't even brush through it alone. She has tried. It takes me 1-2 hours brushing and styling it. She's been to salons. I've paid hundreds for product that basically just mask the issue. What it boils down to is that she cannot handle her short hair without my help and I do not have the time or energy to take 1-2 hours every morning to do her hair right now, after being up with a baby all night. Her, her grandmother and her dad all knew this because I straight up told them before cutting my kids hair that I didn't have time to do her hair in the morning. It was a power play or an attempt to turn my kid against me- which is why her grandmother made a point to tell HER that I have 2 kids, not 1 and should be taking time to do her hair.", "created_utc": 1701625677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189ysql/aita_for_refusing_to_style_my_12yo_daughters_hair/", "score": 2447, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's growing up, and she needs to learn how to do things for herself.  It may be a hard lesson, but better she learn it now.  This may also be a good time for a talk with her about not giving in to pressure from anyone else about how SHE wants to look.

If you can, maybe make some time to talk to your daughter about how she\u2019s feeling, reassuring her about how important she is to you, and see if the two of you can identify some reasonable things that you can prioritize to make her feel loved and special.

Dealing with a new baby is hard and adding 2 hours to your routine until she can manage alone again is untenable, but you were thoughtless in how you communicated with her. She's still young enough that she wants to bond by having you take care of her. That's why her grandmother's manipulation worked so well. Shutting her down so hard, fighting with the other adults in her life - who are already playing on her insecurities, and then leaving her to face the emotional turmoil of school with no support or end in sight isn't effective parenting. You need to reassure her that you love her and are going to take care of her even if that looks different than the expectation that you spend an uninterrupted hour on her hair every morning.   \n\n\nThe biggest thing is don't let this manipulation turn into a trauma. There was a point where I lost a foot and a half of length off my natural coily hair and suddenly I didn't know how to cope. I lost interest in a lot of basic self-care and hygiene going into high school because it all felt awful and ineffectual. Admittedly, it turns out I'm neurodivergent so my complete collapse at a change in my reflection is probably an outlier.   \n\n\nAs far as actual hair solutions. Try braids. A shop is probably your best bet. They will upcharge for long hair (and long for braids is usually shorter than long if you're wearing it straight) particularly if it doesn't hold defined parts.  Depending on the type of braid they can be maintained for months and she doesn't have to be locked into one walking-around hairstyle.

The mom, dad, grandma, and likely the hairstylists are not helping this kid who is clearly struggling.\n\nSome salons just suck. I have very curly hair, and it was even curlier when I was younger. My mom is white with stick straight hair, and she always took me to the same hair stylist who did her hair. For YEARS, the stylist did cuts, perms, sold us expensive products that were all designed to make my hair straighter. She also cut my hair when wet, straightened it at the end of every appointment, and when I went home and wet it I would see how awful it was because the shape of my hair was destroyed. It taught me to hate my hair for years. \n\nNot all salons can handle curly hair. People with curly hair know how hard it can be to find someone who actually knows how to cut and handle curls, and after a while you learn the red flags that show a stylist doesn't actually know what they're doing (i.e. dry brushing and wet cutting). At least 80% of the salon haircuts I've had were really awful, and I would go home and cry at how my hair was butchered. I finally found folks with similar hair textures who could cut it well. Generally speaking, learning about how to care for my hair from black women and using products designed for and by black women has saved my hair. \n\nIt sucks but a lot of white parents with children who have much more textured, curly hair often fail to help a child learn how to properly care for it themselves. And there's a reason that many folks with very textured hair will spend a whole day, often with help, on a wash and protective style, because that way they don't have to suffer through styling it every morning like this. Even a basic pair of French braids done the evening before school would help to reduce this kids struggle.\n\nI hate to say it, but it sounds like the mom has failed to do her due diligence in learning how to properly handle her daughter's hair. Yeah the dad and grandma suck too, but this is an awful cycle, that everyone is contributing to, that is going to make the daughter hate her hair at a time in her life where puberty is already raising hell with insecurities. \n\nBoth of the parents need to be kind, understanding, and take the time to learn and, in turn, teach their daughter how to care for and love her hair.

I'm white and not many of the stylists I grew up with knew how to handle ethnic hair)... a place that can handle hair texture that is more difficult.\n\nMy next question is; is the time your daughter spends over there mandatory?

I've had it at my waist and I've had it at my jaw and everything in between.

Shorter and layered cuts tend to tangle worse, especially at the back of my neck where it rubs against the collars of my shirts or jackets. There\u2019s also a lot more fluff and (imo) too much volume when my hair is short, so I can definitely see where she\u2019s coming from.

If the daugher doesn't take showers in the morning, her hair needs to be protected from tangling during the night if you want to avoid dry brushing. Some protective styles only work on longer hair.
