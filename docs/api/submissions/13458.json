I shared a tent with two little cousins 8 and 10yo and the older of the cousins 16yo shared a small cabin with my sister and her BF.\n\nThe next day my sister and I were on a walk and she was talking about her BF and she casually brings up she had sex with him the night before. I cut her off and said \u201cwith our little cousin in the room?\u201d And she said yes. I got pretty upset and disgusted with her and said that was weird and she was crossing a line. She tried to defend it saying he was sleeping on the floor and they were on the bed and the were certain he was sleeping and they were super quiet etc etc she was just justifying it. The more she tried to defend it the more concerned and upset I got because it was really clear she didn\u2019t see why it was wrong. She pretty much ended the conversation and told me I was over reacting. Over the next few years I have learned they really believe it\u2019s normal to have a sex in a room with other sleeping unknowing people, even family members. (It\u2019s a very large family so it\u2019s not uncommon for the younger family members to share rooms during the holidays/travels)they think it\u2019s not wrong because no one ever catches them. I always made sure to never share a room with them or camp with them again but I never really told anyone about it because I couldn\u2019t tell if I was really over reacting or not.\n\nWell now they are going camping again with some friends and family and I learned the youngest cousin now 11yo is going to be staying in the cabin with them. I got really concerned because I babysat my cousin a lot and I know they pretend sleep a lot and in general a very light sleeper, I was mortified thinking she was going to accidentally catch them in the act. So I told her mother about what happened those years ago and she became livid. First at me for not saying anything before and secondly at my sister and her BF for being \u201cdisgusting perverts\u201d she called my sister in a rage and told her she was never allowed near her kids again and she was going to tell the rest of the extended family about what my sister had done. I believe my aunt was so upset because she knows this probably happened more than once as my older sister use to babysit the two older cousins a lot and they would even stay the weekend at her house at least once a month.\n\nHalf the family is torn because most of them don\u2019t care because they don\u2019t see anything wrong with it and the other half is just as upset and worried if their kids could have been exposed to anything. My sister hates my guts now, but I wasn\u2019t expecting it to blow up like this. I was just trying to look out for my little cousin, not tear the family in the two.", "created_utc": 1680067487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125e3qs/aita_for_telling_a_family_member_they_shouldnt/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry but those kids are not consenting to their apparent kink. You\u2019re telling me they can\u2019t go ONE night without sex? They must have it even if there are half grown people in the room with them? Nope. I have a ten year old and I would be LIVID", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. Your sister and her bf have a few screws loose if they think it\u2019s okay to have sex with children in the room. I\u2019m willing to bet that they have exposed these kids to their activities in the past, even if nobody said anything.", "She.. what? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA OP. It\u2019s weird that she doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019s wrong or simply doesn\u2019t have the self control to wait until their actually alone. You saved your cousin some trauma.", "NTA. Your cousin who is 11 is a light sleeper and pretends to sleep is going to be staying with a 22 year old and her 26 year old boyfriend who have seemingly absolutely no self control. I\u2019m sure your cousin has been exposed to the sexual aspects of the world enough, and doesn\u2019t need to be exposed to it any further! What your sister and her boyfriend did was absolutely disgusting. It was one night and they couldn\u2019t control themselves?! Your aunt had every right to know because she\u2019s sending her child with those two and so does anybody who also sends their child with them frequently.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t want anyone having sex around my kids regardless if they were asleep! You did the right thing \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I just think it\u2019s creepy that they literally did it with a child only steps away.", "Okay wow. NTA. I understand why you feel guilty, but you did the right thing. If one of your cousins woke up in the night (which is not unreasonable) they 100% could come across them having sex\u2026 your sister and her bf are AHs for not being able to hold it together for a night while in the room with a young family member!\n\nETA: couldn\u2019t they have just found somewhere else to do it? >.< gosh.", "That's illegal in my country (if the minor get to hear or see anything, which probably is the case because they are doing it repeatedly), that's how wrong it is\n\nNTA", "Completely NTA. Your sister should know better, and I cannot imagine that awkward feeling of a child laying perfectly still and pretending that they're asleep because they're too embarrassed to say anything. \n\nThere's no reason your sister couldn't wait until they walked down by the lake or hiked with you before she and her boyfriend had an afternoon session. Or better yet, control herself for a few days.", "NTA. You should have told sooner but your sister and her bf are absolute creeps. If she thought it was actually OK she wouldn\u2019t be freaking out that you weren\u2019t keeping this secret for her anymore. If nothing else, she knew the parents of these kids wouldn\u2019t be OK with it and did it anyway. There\u2019s absolutely no justifying what they did. Eugh.", "NTA they crossed the line. If you\u2019re going to share a room like that you stop at cuddling and a quick kiss goodnight. If they were sharing a room with their own toddler and they decided to have sex after the little one fell asleep I think it\u2019s a different issue. Someone else\u2019s teenager in the room, asleep or not, though is just not okay period. They could have snuck out to their backseat or something and taken blankets in case someone walked by the car. There are other solutions if they don\u2019t feel like self control is an option.", "NTA- this actually happened to me as a kid. My cousin and her BF thought I was asleep and started having sex. I was so uncomfortable. I was old enough to know what they were doing and I was disgusted. I got up and called my mom to come get me. My mom and aunt had a confrontation and then nothing was done. Mom still made me go around that cousin all the time. (My mom is very close to her twin sister. They act like they are heartbroken if they don't see each other every other day) anyway I don't speak to that cousin now or my aunt, my mother and I have a strained relationship, and my child is not allowed anywhere near them. There's also more things that happened but basically my cousin is a pervert and I've just recently started telling the family what she's done to me because I'm afraid she did it to my other cousins. I'm hated now for telling the truth.\n\n\nANYWAY..... Thank you for being those kids voice. From a former kid who didn't have anyone to stand up for her. You are doing the right thing.

There needs to be some more self control. Hell\u2026 they\u2019re old enough to have money to get their own room or a motel for the night. Even if they\u2019re broke, having sex out in the woods is better than this.", "NTA. \nYou wanted to protect your cousin and you did!", "NTA your sister and her boyfriend seem a little coocoo in the head like tf why would you have sex in the same room as someone especially a CHILD just the memory  the kid will have after seeing or hearing that stuff, it will haunt the kid and even make sex seem like a bad thing which will likely cause damage in their later adult life. And I know many friends and family members that were affected in their adult life because of just hearing/seeing the deed as kids that stuff really messes a kids mind up.

I told her if people saw them in the act they would not be consenting to that and I pleaded with her to understand that even if there was a 1% chance they would get caught, why risk ever exposing yourself like this to a child and cause life time harm?

You sister has a kink and it is very wrong. You protect child first and foremost.", "NTA this is sexual abuse. Underage children in the room/tent/cabin. Some sort of sleep kink with unwilling participants. There are SO many red flags here, I'm sure this post is going to get flagged.

It happened to me when I was kid and that was just walking into a room at the wrong time and it messed me up, I couldn\u2019t imagine having to pretend sleep through an entire session while being mortified and stuck there. I\u2019m glad now I said something, thank you!", "Thanks for sharing your input. And I agree that I\u2019m wrong for not speaking up sooner, my sister is an amazing manipulator and really good at making me feel crazy, I should have confided in someone else sooner to get another opinion instead of staying silent for so many years and I am regretful for that.

She showed me over and over time and time again she was not a good person. When I became an adult, she even slept with my boyfriend. Like it was ridiculous", "What the hell! She was straight up abusive with little to no empathy for how her actions would hurt you. Your ex and her deserve each other, ass holes.  Happy she is out of your life!"]}
