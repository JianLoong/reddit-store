T, K and G work for my dad\u2019s company. I still have no clue what L does and D is an artist.\n\n\r  \nNot going to lie, being the middle child from a marriage that lasted the least and ruined the previous one meant my relationship with my siblings isn\u2019t the best\n\n\r  \nMy Dad is a complicated figure. But what I can say with confidence is that he is a successful businessman. He built a business from the ground up and made it one of the most successful in the domain it deals with.\n\n\r  \nAt 21 I left home and started doing my own thing. Eventually I also created a successful business in a different domain that now creates a lot more revenue than my dad\u2019s company. I was recently contemplating entering my dad\u2019s domain because it would help further my own company, but of course I was reluctant because I would have to compete with my dad.\n\n\r  \nAbout 2 weeks ago I met with my dad for his birthday. We had a deep discussion where he related to me for the first time the troubles he\u2019s been having in his company. The industry is changing too fast for him for T is a bumbling buffoon who thinks being woke will solve all problems. K is too impulsive. G is too cautious. Upper management is like sharks trying to get the most out of him. He just seemed tired. Told me how having covid took a huge toll on him and put some things into perspective.\n\n\r  \nThen he dropped the bombshell: he was looking to sell. It was like God answered all my prayers. I immediately took the chance to pitch my offer and ideas. He was a bit reluctant initially but he agreed, told me it was the best bday gift I ever gave him. We\u2019re currently going to the proper channels to make the purchase\n\n\r  \nNeedless to say not everyone in the family was as excited.

Wtf is this, medieval England? Does T think he's some sort of prince?\n\nMixing business and family is always a disaster so you should prepare for lots of hurt feelings and hard decisions but it sounds like your family relationship is strained anyway. So do what you have to do.\n\nEdit: I'd never heard of Succession prior to this and disappointed in myself. I thought my BS-meter was better than that and yet I had no idea.", "I see not a lot of people in this sub watch Succession", "Definitely fake it\u2019s way too similar to succession. You even use the same lines in the same situations", "NTA. Like inheritances and large estates, when handing off any form of wealth (in this case a business) to family members, there is usually a period of familial mess. Hell, any change in leadership/ownership of a business usually leads to a period of mess for the business. So be prepared for a general mess on both fronts for a while. You knew this would happen when your dad dropped the bombshell, now you just have to wait for the dust settle and try to avoid any massive conflicts that harm the business. \n\nMy dad owned a business and wanted his kids to take it over. Didn\u2019t happen. We all had different career goals. I\u2019m grateful. When he sold the business, it started to crumble. I don\u2019t think any of his kids taking over instead would have changed the outcome, so I\u2019m just glad we kept family out of that mess.", "NTA - It's your dad's decision to sell the company, and he chose to sell it to you. You're a successful businessman in a different domain, and it's only natural that you would want to expand your own company by entering your dad's domain. You saw an opportunity and pitched your offer, and your dad agreed. It's a win-win situation.\n\nYour siblings' reactions are completely unreasonable. J has never worked and expects to continue receiving dividends without contributing anything. T thinks he's entitled to the company just because he's the eldest son, which is a ridiculous notion. K's claim that your dad won't give the company to a woman is blatant sexism. G's harassment for more money is baseless, as you're paying a fair price for the company. And L's accusation that you're robbing your siblings of their jobs and inheritance is unfounded. You've made it clear that once you take over, your siblings and the upper management will receive generous payouts and can pursue other opportunities.\n\nYour family members who are getting involved need to understand that this is a business decision made between you and your dad. They should respect your dad's choice and stop harassing you. You're not an asshole for seizing an opportunity and taking over the company.", "This is a complicated situation. No one is going to be happy. If you make money rain from the sky, they will see it as an indictment of their efforts. I pray you can deliver on your expectations. Failure will feed their resentment. At least if they are compensated, they have to deal with their baggage. Good luck. NTA.", "NTA or NAH. This is a TOUGH family dynamic to begin with, and things always get more nasty when you combine business and family. Everyone has something to lose here. However, you are doing the right thing for yourself, dad, and both of your businesses. As long as you truly treat your siblings well in the fallout of the business transaction, you are NTA.", "family is always complicated, but i say NTA on the sole basis that your father opened up to you about his business troubles. you didn't ask to meet with him about selling, but it was a good opportunity and it was what your father decided would be best for his company.\n\nnow, you would be an AH if you cut them out or treat them poorly once you own the company. based on the last sentence-- are you planning to buy it and fire them?", "From what you\u2019re giving us, NTA, but I feel like we need more INFO. Why weren\u2019t you a part of the family company and the will? Did you say your siblings can keep their jobs?", "NTA. Would they prefer you drive them out of business after your dad retires?", "NTA. I just started watching Succession!  Good luck.", "Well, if he sold the company to any other company your siblings would be in the same boat, no job and a payout that may or may not be great.   Obviously the oldest son has no clue how to run a successful business or your dad wouldn\u2019t be selling because it isn\u2019t doing well.   \n\nYou are going through the same procedure that any other company would do, I presume, so just don\u2019t engage.  Let the team going over all the books do their job.   Your siblings will resent you either for the rest of their life or they will get a clue, do better for themselves and come out on the other side in a better position.", "NTA\n\nYour post has J as 54 and male, while T is 49 and male\u2026 so how does T figure he\u2019s the eldest son???\n\nI\u2019d issue is something she should take up with your father. You pitched your offer he accepted. If she didn\u2019t pitch an offer then how could he sell it to her? Or is it more she wanted a handout? I feel it might be the latter which isn\u2019t good business in this instance.\n\nIf your father is happy to sell the business to you why would he exclude you in his will? Why does L think that\u2019s relevant here?", "ESH.  This is just toxic.  There is a lot of jealousy.  The father has the right to sell the business to anyone, but if family members have been working here, why 2 weeks ago this strange conversation with you about buying the business?  We only have your side, but it seems this transaction was rather sneaky and like you are 'rubbing their noses in it\".  However: their reactions are petty and childish.  I really hope you do the right thing by the family who have worked for your father.  I suggest mediation and more openess/honesty next time you do 'family' business.  Also there should be no family member who inherits more because of being born eldest.  Where is the equality and fairness here?  Your father also is elderly and seems to have some favouritism here.  You getting this company may just drive a wedge in the family that won't heal, but good luck.", "YTA you clearly made more money than your siblings and want to shove it in their face because of how they treated you when y\u2019all were children.", "YTA because you seem to be dismissive of your siblings perspective.\n\nFrom what you say they have worked they're entire lives at your dad's company. Did they do an amazing job? Hard to say with what little information you give us. \n\nBut it is clear given their age that at the very least they're contribution to the company wasn't minimal and since the company is still standing they clearly didn't ruin it. \n\nYet for somehow you can't seem to see how they might not be so open to the idea of you taking the company and completely kicking them out despite them spending so much of their lives working in it. \n\nTalk about reaping the rewards you didn't sow.", "ESH you for buying your dad's company instead of building something from the ground up for once. \n\nYour dad for being a mysoginistic prick and a neglectful father. \n\nYour siblings for being entitled.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then Dad blindsides them by selling it under them when they're in their late 40s. And tbh your Dad sounds like a shrewd businessman and a master manipulator. He deliberately set it up to sell it to the sibling he has historically excluded. Now everyone is angry at **you**, not him. Your Dad got you to insist on buying by telling you how disappointed he is in the 3 kids he personally mentored, trained and coached in this industry. How they've run it all to the ground.

Look business is business until it comes to family. Then it's personal. Personally I would advise selling the company. Don't get involved in your father's games and your siblings resentment.
