Delilah is married w/ 2 kids. When we hung out it was always at Delilahs (her choice). We babysat for Delilah. I took her dog out for her. All for free. I bought her kids bday/xmas gifts. I would check up on her and try to be a good friend. 2.5 years w/out issue. Annie had a trip. There was an extra spot in the Airbnb so she asked me. Delilah wont do trips bc she doesnt like to leave her kids for that long. The trip was on Delilahs bday. She knew about it & didnt say anything about it. We havent done anything for bdays our entire friendship. At the Airbnb I saw Delilahs SC story \u201cbday dinner\u201d. I asked \u201cis today her bday\u201d. Delilah deleted her fb so we searched thru txts. It was & we felt like shit for not saying anything all day. We texted her Happy Bday. No response. After a couple days, I txted. Annie responded but not Delilah. After a couple days she finally txts, \u201cBeen super busy. Husband has been in & out of hospital\u201d. We said how sorry we r & if there is anything we can do. I add, \u201cI thought u were maybe mad\u201d. She says \u201cwell u guys did forget my bday 2 years in a row\u201d. We say how sorry we r. I add that I am bad at remembering bdays & I want to have open communication & I didnt know what \u201c2 years in a row\u201d means.\n\nA week goes by & she says, \u201cIve had no energy 2 respond. \\*Husband\\* been in & out of hospital. \n\nI appreciate the apology Annie. I understand its easy to forget bdays but it doesnt make it hurt any less. \n\nAnd yeah \\*me\\*, 2nd year in a row. Last year it was the same thing. I only got a happy bday after I posted somethin on SM. Sayin Im bad w/ bdays isnt an excuse bc so am I but I do my best 2 remember the bdays of people I love & are important 2 me. So I dont appreciate the excuse. Just own up to it. U forgot, it was shitty. \n\nAs far as having open communication, I havent had any time to process my feelings on it. It hurt. Thats all Ive allowed myself to feel on the situation bc Ive been so drained. The only reason I mentioned it was bc Annie said she thought I might be mad. \n\nI have my best friend, & u 2. Ur some of the closest people Im w/ even though we dont talk everyday anymore. Even closer than I am with my family, so to realize that Im not important enough to remember a bday for really sucked.\u201d \n\nWe wished her happy bday last year & I did at midnight as it turned to her actual bday. Also Delilah forgot Annies bday last year. She says that we forgot bc we didnt plan something a week in advance. Weve never done this. I apologized for this year but Im not going to apologize for something I did not do. She said Im a shitty friend, rude person, & treat people like shit. That hurt. Annie is also hurt & told her that she agrees with me. I thought that she would have reached out by now but its now a couple months, so Im 2nd guessing myself.

I understand that she is hurt and she has every right to feel how she feels but my refusal to apologize for her feeling like we forgot her birthday last year could make me the asshole.  I'm conflicted because part of me feels like I should not apologize but I did value her friendship so I'm not sure if me not apologizing makes me the asshole.  I'm not sure if I'm just not seeing it from her point of view or if I am correct in feeling like I didn't forget her birthday last year and do not owe her an apology.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I mean yeah, it's easy to add someone's birthday to your contacts once you find out when it is so you can remember next year, but Delilah should know how busy life gets, being married with kids and all.\n\nIf, as an adult, you want your birthday remembered by your friends, you need to casually mention it the week before or something. Personally I don't mind if no one other than my husband remembers."]}
