First, they don't t like your husband. Now they want you to fly 10 hours with a baby. It's so unfair to even want to keep a baby in a plane that long.

Guilt them back. \" I'm astonished that you expect me to put my tiny baby on a 10 hour flight. He's very young and it wouldn't be right to expose him to all those germs. He'd get fatigued and be fractious. He would have no routine. He is not a toy to be handed around from relative to relative.

They still haven\u2019t received all the vaccines at 4months. \nThis would be the prime reason why your baby should not be getting on a 10hr flight.

Don\u2019t call us again.\u201d", "As a frequent traveler, I can tell you that although the other people will be glaring at her, the most miserable person on that plane will be the mother of a small child who has to sit on an airplane for ten hours. Traveling that long with kids is a nightmare.", "This was really well said and I hope OP takes all of this to heart. It isn't OP's responsibility to go running around the globe so their seemingly ungrateful parents can see their grandchild. They do not really sound worthy of the trip and I am doubtful it would be enjoyable for OP. Sending OP some positive vibes and hugs, you deserve love not manipulation and emotional warfare as stated above.", "100% truth.  With my family, we were always the ones driving the 9+ hours to go visit our extended family. It was fine sometimes, but other times I absolutely hated it.", "Yup", "Not to be that person, but lap babies are not recommended and no one should do that. For now, the FAA allows it but it probably won\u2019t be a thing for much longer, and they discourage it. A normal car seat the same as a car is recommended and should be used. [source](https://www.faa.gov/travelers/fly_children)\n\nI agree with everything else you said, why should OP go to such trouble for people that hate her partner? If they care, they\u2019ll travel.", "Perhaps the aunt has heard an exagerated/false vertion from her sister. Not neccesary an AH (but probably)", "This! OP, NTA. Ppl come to babies, babies don't go to other ppl.", "So this. She can't be that excited about the baby if she can't get her butt on a plane.  She's an adult, she doesn't need your father to hold her hand. Asking you to come to her is ridiculous.  \n\n\nWell, at least in throwing her tantrum she's solved the problem. She said forget it, she doesn't want to see the baby anyway. When she starts up, keep reminding her of that. NTA.", "They\u2019d definitely try. When I got pregnant my mom gave me this whole speech about how the West is a terrible place to raise a child (using me as an example). I\u2019d rather raise my child here than where they live right now. Besides my son is biracial and they\u2019re less tolerant of that over there. Plus I\u2019m not living anywhere without my husband and they\u2019d definitely find someway to separate us.", "Yeah I think they\u2019ll put the guilt trip on huge, insist she has so much more help there, etc etc", "For real about the germs. I\u2019m an adult with a fully functioning immune system and I get some kind of cold or illness pretty often after a long (4+ hour) flight, even with wearing a mask. My first Christmas seeing family after COVID I caught something on my flight and was miserable the entire trip, honestly being alone for Christmas would have been preferable to feeling so poorly and having to push through it for the family\u2019s sake.", "I\u2019m still trying to speak up to my parents, as pathetic as it sounds. Me marrying my husband despite their wishes is probably the worst thing I could\u2019ve done so it\u2019s easier now but I still have to remember that I\u2019m not 17 and financially dependent on them anymore. \n\nAnd the pettiness is hilarious. There\u2019s a lovely older couple that I\u2019m close to that have met my son and offered to be his maternal grandparents haha so it\u2019s not like I\u2019d be lying.", "Love this \ud83e\udd23", "Extra points for the pettiness.", "This!!!\n\nI don't understand people today.  There is SO much tech out there that, even if you're halfway around the world, people can still see your expressions while they speak with you.  And yet we have a bunch taking tantrums.\n\nNTA.  Both your parents need to grow up and get over their personal disappointments about YOUR life.", "Where did she say she\u2019s letting him take the fall?", "Yeah this was what I was thinking reading this post, def Asian for sure", "VERY close haha. Didn\u2019t think it would be that obvious.", "Cause they\u2019re assholes", "My guess is that they want the OP to come without her husband.   They know if they come to her, they will have to interact with him.\n\nI'd be very interested to know why they don't like him", "My dad doesn\u2019t care enough to travel and my mom doesn\u2019t want to travel such a long distance without him is the real reason. The reason they\u2019re using is that they\u2019re older.", "Because they can\u2019t hold it over her head if they do the traveling.", "I didn't fly with our kids until they were almost a year old. Also, taking care of a kid by yourself if hard. There's a lot to pack and carry when kids are that young (car seats, strollers, etc).", "OP really needs to go on r/JUSTNOMIL", "And your aunt probably just wants to stop hearing the whining from your mom.", "A hundred percent all of this. And apparently we are just glossing over the fact that her parents (especially her dad) treat her husband horribly???? Why would you want your children around people who hate your partner and the child\u2019s father? OP\u2019s parents are both ass holes.", "I completely agree my brothers wife just gave birth to their second daughter and my mom, my sisters, me and my two grand parents who are both in their 90s flew all day to another state to go see them and help out, if my 96 year old grandma and my 94 year old grandpa who has a pacemaker can fly 6 hours and wait even more in an airport so that their grand daughter in law doesn't have to fly with a 3 year old and a new born then so can ops parents (don't get me wrong my brother takes airport duty with the 3 year old because my sister in law is a sahm bc of lack of child care options) but it's absolutely ridiculous that she won't go to see them and that's a her issue not an OP issue.", "Right!? If she's that excited to see the baby, she can make that happen. It's not OP that's keeping her from meeting the baby.", "Totally agree. My mum can be an absolute piece of work, but she has enough respect for me to know that if she wants to see my kid, she has to make the effort herself and not make it about HER, because she knows exactly what it\u2019s like to be a new mum. \n\nDon\u2019t negotiate with emotional terrorists. Your parents have already made it clear that they don\u2019t respect you, your decisions or your family.", "Good point.\n\nIn the game of control, the best interests of the baby should win out.", "Not in the US, but here it isn\u2019t usually easy to buy a seat for under 2s. And airlines wouldn\u2019t allow us to take a car seat on board. At take off and landing they insist on the flimsy seat belt being used.", "This is an even bigger reason not to go.", "Good LORD do not go. Stay away. Your parents are BAD news and I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them.", "I'm wondering what country they live in and if they could prevent OP and her child from leaving.", "It\u2019s implied by not actually standing up for him in a meaningful way. It should have been NC for a while now honestly", "Sounds like it's your parents that are the babies", "That's BS.  How old are they? 85? 90?  Traveling with a baby is so difficult.  I've done it and it is absolutely exhausting.  If you were my daughter and my husband didn't want to come see his grandchild, I'd go without him.  You are under no obligation to do so.  I'm sorry you're dealing with this.  Congratulations on the little one.  Enjoy!", "It\u2019s just an excuse. They will come if they really want to see your baby. My 90 year old Fil who needs a wheel chair and 80 yr old MIL came last year simply because they wanted to see their grandson graduating high school. They came from India , total flying time 17 hours Plus layovers they travel 25+ hours in all. \nIt completely comes down to loving you and seeing your child.? Your Dad doesn\u2019t even want to see the baby, will he be kind to him? \nYour mom is capable of flying alone if she really wants to see your child. Don\u2019t stress about it.", "Why doesn't your mom fly with a family friend, make it a girl's trip?", "Um.. Then they don't want to see the baby. You're NTA here.", "Sounds like they are their own biggest roadblock. \n\nThey have the option to see the child, they have chosen not to take it. \n\nLeave the option open, but don\u2019t put yourself in a poor position to appease people who won\u2019t make any effort, but demand you do everything.", "That\u2019s a them problem and not a you problem.  NTA, but they sure are.", "That\u2019s because they want to show everyone that they still control you. This is all about control. Don\u2019t give them any power over you. They don\u2019t deserve it.", "How old? I am 63 and travel all the time.", "Your mom is guilting you and asking you to put yourself as a new mom and the infant in a very uncomfortable situation because she doesn't want to inconvenience herself. How they don't see that as disrespectful to you and the baby's health is insane. Please don't feel pressured to do this, any sane parent would love to accept a free trip to come see their grandbaby.", "\"I'm sorry you're letting dad's stubbornness get in the way of seeing your only daughter and grandchild. We aren't able to fly right now, and if you're unwilling to make that effort, I understand.\"\n\nAnd then just play that record allllllll day looooooooog", "How old are your parents? My doctor and his wife were close to 70 when they flew from PA to Australia to meet their grandchild\n\nETA- NTA", "I don\u2019t want to travel 10+ hours with an infant definitely trumps I\u2019m getting old (unless they have notable mobility issues). Tell them you can travel after the baby turns 2.\n\nThe ball is in their court.\n\nAlso, COVID is still a thing. My daughter and her mom just travelled to the UK and both caught COVID. (They were vaccinated). Traveling with an infant is risky.", "Sounds squarely like a them problem and they\u2019re trying to make it a you problem to get what they want. Your dad also sounds like he\u2019s the ah since he won\u2019t do this for you, your mother or himself.", "Your mother and aunt can come together.", "I guess they aren\u2019t actually interested in seeing their grandchild then. Tell them to visit themselves or kick rocks.", "I call BS on your parents being too old to travel (unless they\u2019re 80+yo). My dad traveled solo until his passing at 77 and my mom even with a spinal disability still can fly. \n\nThis story is giving me Desi family vibes (my own is South Asian). If your parents wanted to arranged something and you went against it, it explains why your father is so apathetic to your child. Do you really want your LO near grandparents who think it\u2019s ok to punish a baby for merely existing? You may have to consider going LC with them.", "Then they don't get to see the baby in person.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. If she cared that much, she's travel to you.\n\nShe's how old?  Mid 90s?", "Nope- they need to get their butts on a flight or stop complaining. NTA. \n\nNot to add to your anxiety\u2026but the trip is just the first part! What is baby doesn\u2019t adjust to the water? Needs to see a doctor? Needs anything you\u2019re used to getting with your existing infrastructure? \n\nThis is too far to go with such a little one unless it\u2019s your idea. I know some parents that have done it- and where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way, hats off to them!!! But I would also be firmly staying where I am and happy to purchase their flights.", "Tell your aunt she can travel with your mom, and they can come see the baby together.  You\u2019ll even pay for their flights.  Say this in response to anyone who questions why you\u2019re not traveling with the baby.", "Sounds like a \u201cthem\u201d problem. Your mother doesn\u2019t get to demand things from you. She could always bring some other relative with her if she doesn\u2019t want to fly alone. She just wants to control you. Stay home. Enjoy your family. I personally think I\u2019d be glad they don\u2019t live close. NTA", "NTA they are. They want/your mother wants to meet the baby then she needs to get on a plane and com visit. If not it's not that important to her.\n\nStop feeling guilty - you are prioritizing your baby - hours on end in a closed space with all the illnesses right now is risky for him with little to no immune system and your marriage  over your parents lazyness and quite correctly so.", "Odd. Those are the very similar to your reasons for not wanting to travel, but they have no empathy? And don't seem to realize that a tiny baby can't mitigate the discomforts of travel the way they can? Absurd.", "Older like 80 or older like 50? Because do not let anyone in their 50's try to get you to believe they can't do something because they're too old for it. Source - me in my 50's.\n\nIf they don't have some kind of actual ailment, then, nah, not too old.\n\nEdit - also 10 hours is not so atrocious. My mother, in her 70's, just did that this summer.", "They are stopping themselves, the Gramma can go, she is choosing not to", "This. If it was really that important to them nothing would stop them from getting to your house. They really just don\u2019t want to come and they are using you as an excuse to assuage their guilt.", "My guess is they don't want see the Husband and be in the house with  the Husband. Easier to be disrespectful of teh husband when a) aren't in his house using his hospitality and b) when you can say mean outlandish things without them being easily disproved", "This is the answer. I'm sure there are lots of other really good opinions and pieces of advice in this thread, but this is to the point and spot on.", "I had a similar thought, but given I'm white I wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask. It definitely gave me that vibe multiple times throughout the post.", "Yep. If she really wanted to see the baby she\u2019d travel. We all make choices.", "Plus exposing a baby to a packed airport and airplane is a risk to the immune system.", "Jesus, I\u2019m 62 and fly nearly every week for work, sometimes overseas. This is a power play, if they really want to see their grandchild, they\u2019ll get their butts on the plane. We fly 14 hours to see my partner\u2019s daughter and child, and we often hike up the local mountain with them too. Too old my ass!", "Yep. I know someone who contracted Covid the last time they flew on a plane. Not a big deal for a healthy, fully vaccinated adult, but for a four month old baby? I wouldn't risk it."]}
