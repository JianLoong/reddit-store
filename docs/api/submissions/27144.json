First, they don't t like your husband. Now they want you to fly 10 hours with a baby. It's so unfair to even want to keep a baby in a plane that long.

Guilt them back. \" I'm astonished that you expect me to put my tiny baby on a 10 hour flight. He's very young and it wouldn't be right to expose him to all those germs. He'd get fatigued and be fractious. He would have no routine. He is not a toy to be handed around from relative to relative.

They still haven\u2019t received all the vaccines at 4months. \nThis would be the prime reason why your baby should not be getting on a 10hr flight.
