It's in her room. \n\nGabe always loved games and had a Switch that ended up breaking because of her, so my husband decided that she would go without a console until she was a little more responsible.\n\n I noticed that she started to get interested in Lily's PS5 and I talked to her asking if someday Gabe could play and she said yes but she didn't want her controer to be broken.\n\n I didn't think ahead because the controller is really expensive and she had a good point. \n\nBut These days I noticed that Gabe was playing on the PS5 with Lily and I was happy, I didn't understand how it worked, but it seemed that they understood each other. \n\nMy husband texted me today telling me to talk to Lily about what he was doing with his daughter. \n\nBasically, Lily agreed that if :\n\n1. Gabe washed Lily's dishes that day\n2. She could play for 1 hour in Lily's room (apparently she had a ps4 controller)\n3. She can only play if Lily is there (edited: on weekends she can't). \n4. If she broke that control, she couldn't play anymore\nThat was the deal and every day they do it.  Gabe only plays minecraft.\n\nMy husband thought that Lily was taking advantage of Gabe's goodwill and it didn't cost anything for her to let the youngest play without having to demand something that is her responsibility. \n\nI said I wouldn't interfere with that, because none of them were complaining and that's even a good moment for them (they play together almost always), besides teaching Gabe a little responsibility (she's more careful with the controller). And in the end, it's Lily's PS5.\n\nWe don't agree and my husband says I'm enabling bad behavior between them. \n\nPS: we agree that we educate our children separately. \n\nAITA?\n\nI think it's an extra necessary:  Lily is giving up her game time. She can only play 2 hours a day and she gives up 1 hour of play any other game for Gabe to play.\n\nShe's just asking for it , because I know my daughter hates doing her dishes (at home everyone does their own dishes, so basically she's just washing hers and Lily's).

They\u2019re kids and they made an agreement and both get something they want out of it.", "NTA, the kids came up with a compromise that seems to make everyone happy. In my eyes, the dishes ain't that big of a deal, but if your husband is uncomfortable with it, that's a conversation you guys should have.", "NTA. The list sounds reasonable, and they worked it out themselves.", "NTA \n\nDoing dishes is nothing serious. It's not like she's being forced to vacuum Lily's room , do all her laundry and clean the bathroom!

Gabe isn't complaining about it so why should anyone else?", "Nta. While rule 1 is a little opportunistic, rules 2-4 are BEYOND REASONABLE. Because OF COURSE she shouldn\u2019t be in her step sister\u2019s room by herself- that should already be a standard rule always for all siblings. And if she has an older controller that works, OF COURSE it\u2019s logical that the younger kid who has already broken things should use that. And OF COURSE the older sibling should be allowed to limit how long the younger one is in her room. And if the younger one agreed to do her dishes, fine.\n\nLike\u2026 I actually don\u2019t even understand why your husband would object to  any of this. It\u2019s so\u2026 freaking reasonable and mature of them to figure this out on their own.", "This is honestly excellent older sibling behavior by your daughter! \n\n1. The dishes are a trade for one hour of her allotted game time. Reasonable payment IMO.\n\n2. She is playing in a specified, controlled environment. \n\n3. Under supervision minimizing potential damage/overstepping. \n\n4. With a reasonable boundary. \n\nI see no issues here. \nNTA.", "Yeah I don't see the big deal here.\n\nLily is giving up one of her two hours of ps5 time in exchange for a chore. Additional boundaries are; Lily has to be there to supervise, and her step-sister needs to take care with the controller. \n\nThat's a perfectly reasonable exchange. If both children were teenagers and they made this deal, nobody would think twice. Beyond that, Gabe hasn't complained and seems happy with the arrangement. \n\nI'd sit down with the husband and really try to see why he feels like his daughter is being taken advantage of. If it was Gabe's ps5, wouldn't he want her to be able to set similar boundaries? Maybe reassure him that if it goes any further you'll have a discussion with Lily, or put down boundaries of your own. But until then, it all seems above board to me.\n\nNTA.", "That is completely reasonable of Lily. NTA. It does cost your daughter something, it costs her an hour of using her own console.", "NAH- It\u2019s Lily\u2019s PS5 and the girls seem happy with the arrangement. High five to Lily for brokering a deal with little sis and high five to Gabe for following the deal. They sound like good kids. Tell husband to let the girls do their thing unless an issue comes up and they need help.", "NTA and this could actually be good for everyone.\n\nLily does not like washing dishes. She found a way to get them washed without doing it herself. This is ok as it isn't like schoolwork where there is supposed to be learning value in doing your own work. Rather, this is simply a thing that must be done regardless of proficiency. As soon as Gabe has her own game system, Lillie will need to find something else to offer.\n\nGabe does not currently have a game console as she is in the process of demonstrating that she can use one responsibly. However without access to a system, Gabe couldn't demonstrate her new responsibility with expensive toys. I would think the care that she is showing should help her get her own system sooner, and this trade will come to it's own end. (If each of them has a different system or different games, they can keep working together to all get what they want.)\n\nI do understand your husband's concern about a power imbalance. With Lillie being so much older, she will likely always have something to offer. After this arrangement ends, you can make a rule that chores can only be traded for chores, to ensure that everyone does something to benefit the family. However, if one kid (for example) hates doing dishes, while another dislikes vacuuming, why not allow trades?", "NTA. \n\n3/4 of the rules are directly related to game play so there should be no issue with them.  Hell, I've told my own kid since she was little if she breaks it, she replaces it. \n\nThe dishes bit, that's called \"the price you pay to play.\" Lol. What kid isn't going to try to get out of doing dishes?!", "NAH\n\nEveryone has contributed to this situation.\n\nIn the very short-term, no big deal. In the long-term, there is an unfair balance of power that will build resentment. Lily is a step-sibling, not a parent. \n\n(Just an fyi, you can buy a used PS4 controller for about $20. If you want to have a talk with your husband about Gabe earning money to buy her own, that would rebalance the power between Lily and Gabe.)\n\nIn a way, Lily is doing you and your husband a favor. She's taking on managing Lily's gaming time and content. You and your husband don't have to fight with her about wanting gaming time, content or equipment. \n\nIn a way, this is a win-win. Think through the goals before you rock this boat.", "NAH. I'm a bit concerned about the age differential; older siblings can get very power trippy. But so far this seems to work for the two of them, so let it ride as long as you can. When Gabe is a bit older she may want to renegotiate the deal, assuming she still doesn't have her own gaming system.", "NAH.  You're looking at it as the kids working things out themselves.  He's looking at it as a teenager taking advantage of a younger child.  Both are valid points.  Sit down and talk to each other respectfully to come to a mutual compromise.", "NTA. The kids have worked out a workable deal between them. If either of them dislikes it, they can walk away. Neither was forced into this. \n\nHell, I think this is fantastic! They are bartering and negotiating for a mutual benefit. This is a useful tool for life. And as things change, the deal will change. \n\nThey have made their choices and they should be congratulated on using their heads to find an accommodation. Reward their choices. This is empowering each of them. I would tell them that I am proud of their ingenuity in coming to an agreement and take them out for ice cream or something.", "NTA they found a system that works neither of them are complaining", "NTA.  If your husband feels it is more fair, they could switch chores (Gabe still do dishes, Lily do one of Gabe's smaller chores that she prefers over dishes).  Rules 2-4 should still apply because they make sense.  It is really good for the kids to negotiate between themselves.", "NTA \n\nIf no kid is crying then the kids are fine!\n\nLilly is giving up an hour of her time. The kids worked on an agreement together. The kids are both happy. Why would you do a thing?\n\nYounger sibling is happy they are playing a PS5. Older sibling is happy they are getting some dishes done. Win win", "NAH, and honestly, I was surprised now fair it is, and am actually happy for both of the girls. It is actually a pretty sweet story.", "**NTA** \n\nI don\u2019t see what your husband is concerned about. \n\nThis seems like a good agreement that both girls benefit from.", "Nope, NTA. Dish washing is age appropriate, and you said everyone washes their own dishes, so it's not like the 8 year-old is cleaning a whole sink worth. This sounds like a mature and reasonable agreement both kids are okay with. They're both getting something out of it. This is a compromise, not the older kid taking advantage.", "NTA.  The kids put their heads together and came up with a deal they're both happy with. Doesn't get any better than that. No sense in rocking the boat about a non issue.", "NTA I agree with your husband that Lily is being a mercenary AH by making Gabe do her dishes if she wants to play. That\u2019s such AH behavior on Lily\u2019s part. \n\nOn the other hand, I agree with you: the kids have come up with a system that they\u2019re both happy with, and neither you nor your husband should interfere with that.\n\nYou might, however, work on the concepts of kindness & generosity with Lily if it\u2019s not too late.", "nta gabe is a boy name", "Yta but this is a tough one.  I don't like older kids taking advantage of younger ones, which is what your daughter is doing so that's why I am leaning towards yta.

This includes banking time (doing dishes one day to play the next).\n6. Either Gabe or Lily can dissolve the arrangement at any time for any reason (ex. feeling taken advantage of) but must report that to an arbitrator. Resuming the arrangement can only occur with both arbitrators' consent.\n\nMake sure Gabe knows that she doesn't have to do anything extra. And also let Lilly know that she shouldn't feel pressured to continue if she feels uncomfortable or fears Gabe may damage the console. All in all, I think it's a wonderful compromise, but make sure to check in on it. Gabe may begin to feel a sense of ownership over the PS5.

Dad should stay out of it", "\u201cTaking advantage\u201d is worse than exaggerating imo, it\u2019s a complete mischaracterization of an excellent real-world lesson: negotiation and amiable exchange of services.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m impressed at the compromise they were able to reach on their own, and concerned about husband/dad who thinks it \u201cbad behavior\u201d.

I'm hoping that that is not the case. But the girls have worked out a great deal and he wants to jeopardise it because Gabe has to do dishes", ">While rule 1 is a little opportunistic\n\nDo keep in mind that Lily only gets *two hours* of game time a day, and she is giving up **50%** of that for her younger sister **who cannot have her own gadget because of her history of breaking it** to be able to play. I believe that has to come with strings attached. And it's not like Lily is asking Gabe to do all her chores, just her dishes, and just for the day she wants to play. She doesn't have to do it if she doesn't want to play. So no, rule 1 is not opportunistic. It's also **beyond reasonable**. OP is NTA.", "I mean how many extra dishes is one kid making (I was thinking it was all the dishes at first)? And they are giving up their game time, playing together\u2026 why mess with that? Such a big age gap to come to an agreement. We used to pay my best friend\u2019s brother to come pick us up from the movies. Couldn\u2019t have been much, and we always had a fun time on the ride home. The dad could really ruin these kids working out their own arrangement and spending some time together.

It\u2019s one person\u2019s dishes and Gabe has the choice to not do them any time she doesn\u2019t want to play. \n\nLily took a tough situation and turned it into something they both found fair and agreed to. And Gabe has a way to prove she deserves her own console again.  \n\nJust because letting someone else use your stuff with no rules/expectations is nice does not mean having rules and expectations makes you a AH, much less a mercenary one.", "Dude lucked out in the stepkid department and wants to fuck it up.", " It's also an hour of her time she sets aside to babysit. DH is also blind to the bond forming between the 2.", "If Lily was unhappy about it, yes I agree, but she actually seems to have seen this as an opportunity to bond with the younger step sister without completely giving in.
