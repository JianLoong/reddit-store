Since it was raining heavily the man couldn't go home. My mom introduced her bf just a few days ago as he started to sleep in the living room with the guest matress frequently. The rest of my family approves of him but I don't due to the trauma my ex father caused me when he left us.\n\nMy mom came into my room and told me that the man would temporarily sleep on my bed while i have to squeeze myself with my mom and sister in a single bed in their room because the man said he couldn't sleep at all on the mattress even though I have slept a TON of times on that mattress and Still had a great sleep... OBVIOUSLY i said no because it was like letting a stranger sleep on ur bed and it disgusted me (i havent been exposed well to men who are in their late 40s except for my uncles ever since my father left me). Note to this story that the house is owned by my grandma and that my grandma knew NOTHING about my mom letting the man sleep on my bed. \n\nMy mom kept giving me a glare and told me to lend it just for a night but i still refused. My sister then budged in and made everything worse as she said that my mom will not allow me to go out of the house even if its for school project purposes if i do not lend my bed. Ofcourse i didnt submit myself to that as i continued to refuse and stayed on my bed. My bed is the only thing that keeps me from the stupid outside world as well I also get possesive of what's mine. Im fine with friends and acquaintances but complete strangers is what despise.\n\nAt the end of the night my mom's bf still sleeps on the ground not in the living room but in the room of my mom and my sister's room.

The living room has a couch, does it not??? It is extremely inappropriate for a full grown ass man to be in your kid's bed. So weird.....You need your space and privacy.\nAnd your sister budding in like that.....seems like you have two authoritative figures and it SHOULD NOT be that way.....", "NTA. why is your mother suggesting you give up your bed for a man you've barely known? why can she not give up or share her bed? i do think you need some help with your issues that have come about from your father leaving but it is completely abnormal for your mum to suggest this and then ground you for TWO MONTHS.\n\nINFO: how old are you?", "NTA.\n\n\n\nYour mom is way out of line. Have you talked to your grandparents? The actual owners of the house and explain the situation?", "Did this happen August 17th, 2017? Like during hurricane Harvey? How can someone get stuck at a house due to rain unless it\u2019s literal biblical flooding?\n\nOh, NTA", "nta. i've been in similar situations where my mom would give my room to someone i barely knew and i had to sleep up front it was always uncomfortable as i had to sleep without a mattress. in my situation i had no choice though but i'm super glad you stood your ground and told her no. \n\nalso your mom is an ah here especially for putting a man's comfort in front of her own child's comfort.", "NTA - Your mom is an asshole who\u2019s prioritizing dick over her kids. Don\u2019t let weird old dudes sleep in your bed. It\u2019s embarrassing that your mom would even ask such a thing of you, and I\u2019m super sketched out about this biblical rain situation that\u2019s somehow forced ol\u2019 Cletus to shack up in your grandma\u2019s house.", "NTA I'd be SO PISSED if I were you. Even if you had known him for a lot longer AND liked him you wouldn't be TA. It's your bed. But the fact he's a STRANGER? Alone in your bedroom?? In YOUR bed while you're forced to sleep elsewhere???? What is wrong with your mom??", "I am going with NTA - no one has the right to expect you to let a grown ass man - a near stranger sleep in your bed. I admit, If someone did that to me, I would never be able to sleep in that bed every again and I am a grown woman. How snowflakey of your mother to expect that - so sad bad parenting.", "Im a little Sus about this post...", "Why is this BF not sleeping with your mother?\n\nThat's weird.\n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mom\u2019s bf came by the house to talk to the grandparents but couldn\u2019t leave due to rain? OP claims to have only met him a few days ago and yet says that he sleeps there frequently. How and why is the sister so involved in a situation that has nothing to do with her? How horrible is the mom that she\u2019s letting the sister determine punishment. Why isn\u2019t the sister sleeping on the air mattress instead of in bed with the mom and also how old is she? What does \u201cnot being exposed well to men in their late forties\u201d mean and how is it relevant?", "ESH. The reason you suck is, \u201cthe rest of my family approves of him but I don\u2019t due to the trauma my ex father caused me when he left us\u201d.  Your mom\u2019s boyfriend has nothing to do with your father or your ex father. Boyfriend is not responsible for what someone else did. You should approve of disapprove of him because of what he does & says, not because of what your (ex) father did.  With regard to sleeping arrangements, if sounds like boyfriend should go home & sleep in his own bed.", "I agree with everything you wrote with the exception of suggesting the mother gives up her share of the bed. The mother should never allow that man to sleep in bed with her children. I would\u2019ve asked OP to possibly allow her sister to sleep in bed with OP Ana dyne adults could share a bed. IDK, this whole situation seems out of line in my book.\n\nNTA there OP. I\u2019m proud of you for holding boundaries", "17 almost 18 in january", "I love seeing Texas people comment. Who else would know the exact date of that hurricane. I totally slept in my closet those days. It fit a twin mattress and lots of snackies.", "Perhaps he's made of sugar and is afraid he'll melt?", "We get flash floods here that include phone/tv alerts saying stay inside and don't travel anywhere unless it's an emergency.", "Australia is currently getting a lot of water dumps on it. If you live our rural ish, I can see you getting stuck overnight easily.", "Yeah I\u2019m gonna go with what is or isn\u2019t happening sexually between OP\u2019s mom and her new boyfriend does not create a situation in which OP sucks.", "Cuz my sis doesn't have her room yet and she sleeps with my mom. Still it is weird for my mom.", "Sounds like op is a minor and it's on the mom to get op help in coping with whatever the father did.", "Nah this is a stupid fucking take of the situation. OP isn't an AH for liking or not liking the guy. You aren't required to even give someone the benefit of the doubt. As long as OP isn't being openly hostile with the man, they've done nothing AH in this situation.", "apologies, maybe my response doesn't make sense. what i mean is the mother should have offered to share her bed with her partner or give her bed up, the children should never have been involved. if a sibling shares mothers bed usually then they could be on the blow up mattress but really i think 100% the partner should be in mums bed or sofa! this isn't the children's responsibility!", "i think it is wrong for her to suggest you give up your bed. if it was a family member coming on a visit that would be different, but this situation isn't cool. you deserve your space. again NTA.", "Your sister could obviously take the mattress and put it in your room. Unless you're going to complain about that too.\n\nOffer solutions instead of creating more conflict.", "It\u2019s an AH move to judge people, either positively or negatively, based on something they had nothing to do with. That\u2019s just making stuff up. If you think that\u2019s a smart way to make decisions, then I feel sorry for you & the people who are affected by decisions you make.", "I could always let my sister sleep on my bed but i dont know why my mom wasnt thinking about other solutions. Btw my mid terms are coming up soon thats why my mind was clouded with shit", "Why do you think it's the child's job to offer solutions to this situation and not the mother's? OP is not \"creating conflict\" by refusing to give up their bed to a stranger, and this isn't their problem to solve.", "Judging or not, people are allowed to have boundaries. The mom is the AH for violating her daughter's. End of story.", "No, it's not. You're allowed to feel however you want about people. Whether that's from their actions or even just your gut feelings. How you *treat* people is what matters. Honestly I feel bad for people affected by *your* choices if you aren't able to separate your feelings about someone from the choices you make. That's a vital life skill to develop that you've clearly missed out on.", ">It\u2019s an AH move to judge people\n\nShes not judging him, she's a teenage girl with trauma who doesn't want a middle aged man sleeping in her room.  What the fuck are you on? You seriously think this random forty year old dudes feelings are more important than a KID learning and setting boundaries with adults who want to encroach on her personal, private space? \n\nFuck outta here with that bullshit.", "So No One was thinking. You aren't the only one experiencing stress. Your mom isn't always going to be the one to offer the best solutions. You should apologize and tell her you were stressed out and offer the alternative sleeping arrangements for the future. It sucks, but that's probably the best way to get out of being grounded.\n\nI suggest that you start looking into coping mechanisms for stress, because being an adult only gets more Stressful. r/copingmechanisms\n\nHopefully your mom will apologize to you for popping off as well, but in this case it may be simplest to eat some crow.", " Why do you think that only a mother can offer a solution if the child disagrees and has a better idea?!\n\nYou think kids should only be seen and not heard?!\n\nDo you think mothers are going to be perfect all the time? Are YOU perfect all the time? Are all your ideas brilliant? I can tell they are not just from your comment.\n\nAnd yes, an argument Is conflict.", "What the actual fuck is wrong with you? Are you really just carpet bombing this thread with blame for a child being put into a weird sleeping situation because of a new love interest?", "Op.  Do Not Apologize.    You've done nothing wrong by wanting your privacy.   To even suggest someone sleep in my daughter's room her father would lose his absolute fuckin mind.  The fact that she so flippantly decided he could stay in the same house as her children and then to take her kids bed as if there wasn't anywhere he could possibly be is completely absurd.   People thinking YOU as the CHILD should have the solution is almost as absurd.   Stand your ground.   It'll be a shit grounding but it's worth you getting to feel like a damn human being.   Start planning a way out when you are old enough.  Go low or no contact after. That is not, and I cannot stress this enough, NOT a healthy environment. \n\nObligatory NTA.", "Jesus you can't possibly be this dense like... for real, right? \n\nIt isn't at all the child's responsibility to figure out sleeping arrangements for their parent's grown ass adult boyfriend. \n\nFingers crossed you don't actually have children you raise with this same lack of critical thinking.", "Bro just say you\u2019re the mom in the story ffs", "NTA.   \n\nA different situation could have been acheived, your sister sleeping with you and then your mom and her BF could have slept together.    Maybe your bed doesn't creek and that's why they wanted it? \n\nAnyone else sleeping in your bed is VERY creepy.   You don't know if he has any sort of parasites (lice, scabies, bedbugs on his clothes).   \n\nHave a chat  with your grandparents.   Unless there was something else that you're grounded for it's unrealistic for you to be grounded for not sharing your bed.   It's a very personal thing.", "NTA. Tell your grandma what\u2019s going on, maybe she can talk some sense into your mom.", "Also if it was so dangerous outside he shouldn\u2019t go home, how did he get there?", "There is also golf ball sized hail in this weather. At least where I am there is."]}
