(As an example) If he makes 1k and I make 500, and we both have to put in 500 for rent, I'm left with nothing and he's left with 500? Does that really seem fair? I know it might be different if you share a bank account and because you're living comfortably and it doesn't actually come down to your last dollar, but I actually think splitting it by a percentage (or just pitching in and both of you doing what you can) is a good way to split things.

If absolutely married to a 50/50 split despite a high earner being able to do more it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d but also unfair as high earner unable to live as comfortably just to keep partner not feeling bad financially.\n\nAlternative one person is happy to put in 700 in order to move up to a 1 bedroom.  Both people benefit from this.  Realistically the higher earner even if single would probably put more into housing so not huge burden .\n\nHowever if they forced a % split and some how it ended up being like 400 vs 800, despite the lower earner able to out in 5, they are contributing less AND getting more space can feel like being used\n\n\nSo\u2026yea.  I think a % basis can be good, but also need to factor in minimums or realities like-if we were doing 50/50 would we be living the same life style?  Why yes or no?  The higher earner should be the one who volunteers more, or not\n\nIn your case 50/50 leaves you both with considerable savings?  Really no reason to do it other ways.

If your husband were unable to contribute more because of a disability or something, I'd say the % split makes sense.

Furthermore, if grandparents are helping out, he's not even putting all the additional energy into childcare. He's putting it into himself. I'm curious what would happen if you, god forbid, lost your job and he had to start working more. Would the percentage split make sense to him then? I'd keep it 50/50, OP.

Yes child care is labor but him picking up the child doesn't seem to be the deciding factor here, rather his pattern of wanting your money.\n\nAnd this ideal of sharing everything in a partnership is a bit outdated in my opinion. People have different relationship models nowadays, if you don't feel comfortable he should accept it or leave. I'd rethink the house situation but then again you probably don't have a prenup so what you earn more than him is likely half his anyways, so maybe it wouldn't be effective.

Rent, car payments etc. come out of that. The rest we get to use individually as we please.

So unless OP has commented somewhere that he's either bragging about working less than her, or DEMANDING she pay more without discuasing it in full then I still think how she's phrased this whole thing is from a very jealous angle."]}
