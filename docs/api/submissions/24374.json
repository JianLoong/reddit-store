This is just something you need to work out and come to an arrangement on. Neither of you is necessarily wrong, and both arrangements can work. The only case in which I could see it being particularly problematic is if you were living close to the limit of your means or if one spouse were running up the bills disproportionately.\n\nIt's something that would be more difficult if your incomes were drastically skewed though.

(As an example) If he makes 1k and I make 500, and we both have to put in 500 for rent, I'm left with nothing and he's left with 500? Does that really seem fair? I know it might be different if you share a bank account and because you're living comfortably and it doesn't actually come down to your last dollar, but I actually think splitting it by a percentage (or just pitching in and both of you doing what you can) is a good way to split things. Sometimes in marriage you have to put in the extra % that your partner may be lacking for whatever reason because for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, right??", "NTA 50/50 is way to do it .

If absolutely married to a 50/50 split despite a high earner being able to do more it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d but also unfair as high earner unable to live as comfortably just to keep partner not feeling bad financially.\n\nAlternative one person is happy to put in 700 in order to move up to a 1 bedroom.  Both people benefit from this.  Realistically the higher earner even if single would probably put more into housing so not huge burden .\n\nHowever if they forced a % split and some how it ended up being like 400 vs 800, despite the lower earner able to out in 5, they are contributing less AND getting more space can feel like being used\n\n\nSo\u2026yea.  I think a % basis can be good, but also need to factor in minimums or realities like-if we were doing 50/50 would we be living the same life style?  Why yes or no?  The higher earner should be the one who volunteers more, or not\n\nIn your case 50/50 leaves you both with considerable savings?  Really no reason to do it other ways.

If your husband were unable to contribute more because of a disability or something, I'd say the % split makes sense.

Furthermore, if grandparents are helping out, he's not even putting all the additional energy into childcare. He's putting it into himself. I'm curious what would happen if you, god forbid, lost your job and he had to start working more. Would the percentage split make sense to him then? I'd keep it 50/50, OP.

There\u2019s a lot more factors at play and it\u2019s worth trying to see if you can compromise on at least some of those or try to reach a better understanding of how you both be supportive of each other, even if it may not be in a monetary way.", "NTA", "I don't understand why all income doesn't go into a joint 'consolidated revenue' pot.

He chose another market that suits him so I'm not sure why you sound resentful when telling us.\n\nWhile he may not bring in as much finance as you but his role is balanced with work and home. Yours is not but that's not on him so why penalise him for it financially?

However, from your other replies he seems to have made selfish decisions that benefit his financial position over yours in the past when this position was reversed. If you used to make less and still contributed the same amount then there's no reason the 50/50 agreement should change now that you're earning more. NTA if that's the case.", "NAH.

Your are a 50/50 team regardless of what you each bring to the table. Sounds like you guys don't feel secure or something if you aren't wanting to just pool your money together. Some of your comments also come across like you are annoyed or jealous of your husband for having a more low key job with good work/life balance.

Idk why people are jumping on you for being ungrateful that he does more childcare than you. I didn't get that vibe at all. Does he feel like you do enough childcare? Do you care how much money he makes?\n\nI think this whole thing is a weird pointless power struggle. If you both make enough money to pay for everything, buy stuff, and save loads then what does it matter? It should just be 50/50, fair, no arguments. NTA, you're right. He's already getting richer just by being your partner...wtf does he need more for?", ">We have his parents helping out so if he'd rather work than be with her, he could have done so.\n\nYeah, can't wait for you to tell your daughter when she grows up that. That your husband should've bonded less with her if we wanted more money. Bonding with a parent is important for a child emotional upbringing. Makes them feel loved, rather than a burden that had to be pawned off to their grandparents. It seems to me you are really devaluing how important this is, and how sensible it is for your husband to do this.\n\nAs for the bills, I do think it is usually sensible to split based on % income. But, there is a lot of leeway in this. It is obviously different if 50/50 means that one spouse only gets to keep 1/3 or 1/4 of their income, whilst the other is barely a dent. \n\nYou have also added context that he had a different way of thinking whilst you were a student.\n\nYou could always divide based on income and stop paying for those extra things, so that the split is more reflective of the reality. \n\nOr, if money is not that much of an issue, you could keep paying 50/50 and put the difference in % towards a fund for your daughter.", "We each keep 250bucks we can do with as we please.

Yet I don't tell people who want to merge their finances not to get married (even though I've seen people who lived to dearly regret that decision).", "Viewing separate bank accounts as a lack of trust is actually really unfair and quite narrow minded. I can see how you might like to have a joint bank account and how it works for you, but for me and my wife we have our own bank accounts, and put money for the bills and mortgage into a joint bank account each month. There is no lack of trust, there is simply we are happy managing our own bank accounts, as we have done throughout our lives before we met and got married.
