I also have a brother but he's not relevant to this story because he's like 13. \n\nI'm very close to Angela for a number of reasons, one being that I was the only person to take her mental illnesses serious.\n\nI went to college a year early at 17 and when I was 19, I noticed that Angela was losing weight rapidly. It was basically my worst fear coming true because my parents always bullied her for her weight. I hadn't been home for a good few months when I returned to see her very thin and I spent hours begging my parents to get her treatment. She was very resistant to treatment but eventually they got her into a program. She then started acting out really dangerously by sneaking out late, hanging out with the wrong crowd and taking drugs and alcohol. My parents thought it was her rebelling because of treatment and they refused to take her to a psychiatrist, so I went back home and took her to the ER myself. I was dead sure she had some form of bipolar disorder because she was behaving similarly to one of my friends who had it and I was right. Since getting meds for her BD, she's recovered from her ED.\n\n\nAfter this, she got into the same college that I was in and she met one of my boyfriend's (Ryan 32M) old foster brothers (Ray 26M) and they started dating. They've been together for six years and engaged for two of them. They're an amazing couple and I couldn't be more happy for them. Their wedding is in the summer.\n\nOver Christmas break, Angela asked me if I could walk her down the aisle. She said that initially, she didn't want to be walked down the aisle because she hated the origin of the tradition, but she thought about it and decided that she wanted me to do it because I supported her a lot during our teens. I was and still am honored, and I accepted. \n\nOriginally, our dad wasn't too bothered because he understood that Angela didn't want to be 'given away' and having me do it meant something different, but I guess he's had a few days to think and he's decided he isn't a fan. He called me to ask if I'd tell Angela I wouldn't do it and convince her to ask him instead and I said no because she's made her choice and he's gotta respect it. \n\nWe got into an argument and he called me an asshole for 'stealing' his chance to walk his only daughter down the aisle and for not even trying to get her to reconsider. I hung up on him but now I'm feeling bad about the situation because although their relationship was bad when she was younger, they've really worked on improving it through therapy and by not trying to get her to reconsider, their relationship could be damaged in some way. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673778492, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cgjzh/aita_for_agreeing_to_walk_my_sister_down_the_aisle/", "score": 864, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It makes a lot more sense for her to want you to walk her down the aisle than y\u2019all dad\n\nAlso, she is the bride and it is her choice on who walks her down the aisle.

Besides, I have no doubts that if you did refuse she would just go down the aisle alone so it wouldn\u2019t be a lost for her either way", "NTA\n\nHe blew his chance when he put his daughters health at risk and refused treatment. You made sure that she was taken care of and safe and thats why she's asked you.", "NTA, your sister has made her choice and you are respecting that. \n\nIts not clear how much of your dad's change of view to not being a fan might relate to his own feelings about missing out on walking his daughter down the aisle and how much might relate to him realising how it might look odd to the other guests to see the brother-of-the-bride instead of the father-of-the-bride walking her down the aisle.  \n\nIf your dad's got an issue with how it might look, and of course if your sister is agreeable, perhaps you could explain to guests that you are (a big part of) the reason the bride and groom met and it is because of how that happened the bride thinks it is appropriate you walk her to the groom on the wedding day?", "NTA - This isn\u2019t your decision. All you get to decide is if you want to walk her. She gets to pick who she asks to be in that role for HER wedding. It\u2019s likely if you decline at your dad\u2019s request that she\u2019ll just go back to her original plan of walking alone.

But if she still decides she wants you by her side that\u2019s her choice and your dad needs to come to terms with that.", "NTA. This is her decision, and her decision alone. If he\u2019s upset about it, he should talk calmly about it with her, then respect whatever she decides.", "NTA.  This is your sister's wedding and this is something she has asked you to do.  You supported her through some very difficult times in her life and advocated for her in ways that have helped make her life significantly better. \n\nNow, you could encourage her to include your father in something else that makes him feel acknowledged - like a father-daughter dance if she wants to do that. But ultimately it's still her decision and she can say no to that as well.", "NTA. Question...Has your dad talked to your sister to let her know his feelings and concerns, or is he just wanting you to handle everything for him? If he wants to walk her down the aisle, then he should speak to her himself about the whole situation, and leave you out of it. Ultimately, it's obviously up to her, and she had her reasons for asking you to begin with, though. \n\nAlso, congratulations btw, and kudos to you for being there for her and fighting for her when noone else would listen or even try to acknowledge that she needed help.", "NTA, your sister choose you.  Do you know why she choose you?  It's because of thebfact that when she was at her worst, and struggling YOU were the one that helped her while your parents ignored her.

You should be there for your sister at her wedding in the role she wants.  \n\nAs for her relationship with your father, even if you had backed out in response to your dad's pressure, my guess is your sister would not have taken it well. The reality is she would have gone back to her default of having no one walk her down the aisle and be pissed off at your dad throughout the wedding.", "NTA. And I scanned the comments but none that I've seen have really spelled it out. OP, you saved Angela's life. If you hadn't pushed your parents to get her into treatment it's likely that she wouldn't be alive today. Your care for her meant that she's now alive and thriving.

Her wedding. Her decision. She couldve asked her father in law if she wanted. Hell maybe even her mother in law or both. Just bc you have that connection to someome doesnt mean you should expect to automatically get that role.", "NTA. I can't help but think that your father only started to care when he realised that people may look at him in a poorer light because he's not the one doing it. Like many people at the wedding may not know that you stepped up for your sister because your parents kinda sucked, he probably isn't too fond of that being made public knowledge.\n\nUltimately he wasn't a good father to his daughter and whilst that may hurt him, he has no one but himself to blame.", "NTA.

I am sure dad feels bad but this is totally up to the bride.  Good for OP for being such a good brother.", "NTA. Don\u2019t budge. It truly is your sister\u2019s day and she asked YOU- what an honor.", "NTA. Your sister wants YOU to do it. You could MAYBE tell her that your dad would like to do it, but that you're still happy to do so, and then leave it up to her to decide what she wants.", "NTA, your dad did this to himself by being a bully to your sister.", "NTA. Your relationship with your sister is so important in her life that of course she wants to honor you!", "NTA\n\nIf it wasnt for you, your father wouldn't even have the opportunity to be upset about this situation.\n\nHe may have played a part in her creation. But you played a bigger part in maintaining and supporting her life.\n\nIgnore your dad, even if you said no, I doubt Angela would ask him. If she'd wanted him she'd have told him.", "NTA and what an amazing brother you are. Your dad needs to respect your sisters wishes. He\u2019s the AH.", "It\u2019s not up to you to try to change your sister\u2019s mind. Your dad can talk to her or let it go. NTA", "NTA - you\u2019re a good brother. You deserve to walk down the aisle", "NTA  \n\n\ncant steal what was never his", "NTA and a fantastic brother. Your dad can get over himself.", "Bride rules, acceptable accommodations = NTA", "NTA... Moral of the story is, you stepped up for your sister. Your father never did. It mad an impression on her", "Yeah, I hate the easy ones.\n\nBecause here is the real story: the father bullied the daughter into a state of bulimia.  Now that she is recovered, she feels closer to the brother who saved her life than the father who endangered it.  The father took several weeks to realize that was the case, and that the wedding arrangements would make it undeniable, and he is bad.\n\nI cannot say that every friction between a parent and an adult offspring are the parent\u2019s fault, but most probably are and this one certainly is.", "Ahh. Well, my answer still stands. You\u2019re NTA. You\u2019re doing what she asked of you. His issue is with her, not you. Even if you backed out, there\u2019s still no guarantee that she would let him do it.", "NTA. What an honor to walk her down the aisle!", "op=NTA\n\nYou must know she didn't just flip a coin over this decision, she thought about it long and hard before she asked you.  \n\nTrying to talk her out of it would be telling her that she doesn't know her own mind.  \n\nShe also doesn't need to be guilted about her decision, by you and esp. NOT by your father.", "NTA. I can understand the hurt feelings here on behalf of your father (and I\u2019m sure he is also thinking about the \u201coptics\u201d of this situation and how to explain it to his family and friends at the wedding) but ultimately he made this bed and now he has to lie in it\u2026", "NTA. It\u2019s HER decision and she picked YOU. That\u2019s an honor, don\u2019t allow your dad to steal that you both.", "NTA. If your Dad fucks around anymore he might get uninvited from the wedding.", "NTA", "Yes OP should be proud and honored, don't make his problems your problems OP, NTA!"]}
