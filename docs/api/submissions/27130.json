It was her first time on such a long flight and she did very well. I bought along things that would make it easier for her and me to experience the flight.\n\nWhen we boarded the plane - we were one of the last ones but did not cause delay - I heard some one say something about being annoyed by the presence of a baby but I paid them no mind and focused on getting us comfortable. At take off, I feed her to try prevent ears popping and its largely successful but she does cry for a few minutes - literally - but I just stuck my nipple in her mouth again and it pacified her. She falls asleep for 90 minutes. When she's awake - she's doing some baby babble and largely keeping herself entertained. I also play with her which invokes loud laughter for about 5 - 10 minutes before we quieten down.\n\nFood is served, people eat and lights are dimmed for sleep. She lies awake in her little basket babbling to herself until we his some violent turbulence which causes a couple of screams in the cabin, scaring my baby. I think it's all a bit much for her and she just cries. I think she spends the better part of 15 minutes crying and there's not a lot I can do to calm her while the turbulence periodically continues. I do my best to soothe but she just tires herself out and slept for some hours. After I was sure she was down, I stood to stretch and walk up and down the aisle when a passenger makes a snarky comment about how relieving it is to be free off the wails of my 'crotch gobblin', but how some of us don't deserve to suffer because not all of us signed up for 'this shit'. I said 'excuse me?', hoping she'd withdraw but she went on about how annoying my baby is, how selfish I am for choosing a busy flight, punishing people who paid more (we were in premium economy, hardly first class but ok) and disturbing other passengers and not having the decency to prepare them all a care package for the inconvenience of having to ' tolerate my brat and I'.\n\nThis is where I may be the TA. I called her a vapid c\\*\\*t. I told her my baby is a human being and she has as much right to occupy a public space as anybody else. I told her I don't have to bribe them with care packages when I bought my seat on this plane like everyone else. I said she's been on her best behaviour and if the turbulence is enough to scare adults, how the fuck does she expect my baby to deal with it? I was speaking louder than I realised - though not yelling b/c my baby - and the air hostess came and asked for us to remain civil. I apologised, turned away and carried on with my business before returning to my seat. When I returned to my seat, someone nearby said I was very rude for calling the lady names and I could have given people ear plugs and little treats as a gesture of good will. I told her not to piss me off; if she wanted to control the environment completely, she should have chartered a private jet.\n\nI just hate this trend where it's increasingly okay to be hostile to children for doing what children do.

I\u2019ve read about this *once* but the person only handed out a note, earplugs & a mini chocolate. I\u2019m staggered that someone actually expected a \u2018care package\u2019/gift?! *Really*?!

I don\u2019t have kids and I find it weird that parents think they need to bribe their fellow travelers with gifts on a flight. \n\nAlso, let\u2019s normalize the use of the c-word. This is the perfect scenario for rolling it out.", "NTA.  You did everything reasonable to ensure your baby wasn't disturbing people,  and babies can't be expected to be little adults. It's fine to be irritated by young children, but be a reasonable human being and keep it to yourself if they're not ridiculously over the top and the parent isn't doing anything.  Everything you said was spot-on and needed to be said. I have never expected a goodie bag from a parent.  They have enough to do minding their children while traveling", "NTA as someone who doesn\u2019t have kids and travels frequently I understand babies exist and sometimes you can\u2019t get them places without a planes.

It\u2019s unreasonable to expect the same level of quietness from a baby than an adult.\n\nThe only thing you should have done differently is invoking loud laughter for 5-10 min with play. Yes, it\u2019s minor in the grand scheme of things, but having to deal with 5-10 min of unnecessary loud baby sounds feels like an eternity in an enclosed space. The babbling and reactions to turbulence are largely outside of your control, but you should not have been actively invoking loud reactions with play, that\u2019s entirely within your control.\n\nThat\u2019s the only part where you may have been a bit of an AH, not the part where you responded to the rude passenger with the same energy.", "NTA. I hate listening to kids scream on planes too, but that's life. Kids exist, kids make noise. As long as a parent is actively doing their best to parent, ie not letting the kid run screaming up and down the aisles, play with loud flashing toys, kicking someone's seat incessantly etc, it is what it is. You are flying economy on a plane, who TF doesn't bring their own headphones and earplugs and expects someone else to give them out.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d much rather be sat next to a baby than a rude or drunken adult. \n\nIf the turbulence was enough to make adults scream, how was she surprised it made your baby cry?!", "NTA. As a former baby who, at 10 months, had to travel on a long flight because my parents had to return to their home country, I never get mad at people bringing babies on flights. I don\u2019t know their circumstances or why they are on these planes. Maybe it is important and for a good reason and babies, like all people, do sometimes need to travel. Not everyone is taking a jet setting vacay. \n\nWe all must accept some humans are less developed and cry. As long as the parents are making an effort there\u2019s no reason to complain to the parents or in the parents hearing space.

I don't blame a kid for crying when their ears hurt, I do blame parents for intentionally encouraging their baby make noise on an airplane. To you they are happy noises, to others they are like dragging nails on a chalkboard.     \n\n\nI don't expect gifts from people with kids, I do expect them to do their very best to keep the kids quiet.  \n\n\nDoing it from premium seats make you an even bigger AH IMO.", "Once I was flying from Europe to the us and a baby cried most of the way.  The parents were walking her up and down the aisle trying to sooth her but nothing worked.  You know what all the passengers did?  Nothing.

It\u2019s not like you were ignoring her, you dealt with it. \n\nNTA.", "Eh, gonna go against the grain with ESH, pertaining to you AND the woman who made the comment.\n\nYes, you and your baby should be able to exist in a space you paid for like any other human being. Yes, people are going to be agitated because it's a 10 hour flight and no one could predict whether your baby will be behaved or not. Not everyone has a good experience with babies on flights, though I don't think you should have to hand out treats as a bribe. She shouldn't have made the comment and purposefully argue with you. But you can't expect everyone to be in a good mood about a baby on a long flight.", "NTA. I remember my son doing this as a baby one time on a 5 hour flight & me trying literally everything I could to get him to be quiet . I was practically in tears because of my anxiety & fear that I'd piss the other passengers off. I'm sure I did but luckily they were quiet about it\n, just like I am when I hear babies cry on flights even though I prefer to be knocked out on flights due to fear.  It's annoying to people with no kids but kids do exist and have to fly sometimes as well, so people can either deal with it or charter their own private jets/drive/sail.", "NTA - the trend of giving out gift bags to other passengers needs to stop. Babies exist. If you want to fly without one near you, rent a private jet. Otherwise, as long as the parent is making an honest effort, it\u2019s just something you have to live with. \n\nBesides, inconsiderate jerks and drunks are far more annoying and I\u2019ve never heard of *them* giving out presents to apologize for their behavior in advance.", "NTA. I get second hand embarrassment seeing people hate on whole ass people for something they can't control(their age). It reminds me when I was an edgy 15 year old hating on babies and making shitty jokes about them. I find babies crying annoying too. I feel like that's a normal annoyance. I also find people chewing gum too loud annoying. But you know what I do? Mind my own fucking business and put in my earbuds. If they didn't have the foresight to bring their own headphones or ear plugs that's on them. Babies are allowed to be in public spaces.", "NTA. Unless this person is being transported on the flight against their will, then they literally did sign up for this shit.

Exactly that. You did right by yourself, your baby, and everyone around you. Good job!", "Never happened", "I'm astounded by the level of entitlement that people are climbing to these days. If something is a minor inconvenience for them, like hearing a baby cry in a situation where they can't exactly get away from it, they expect to be compensated for it.\nTbh, I think it's an odd gesture giving everyone on the plane a bag of sweets or something just to say sorry for the fact that there's a baby on the plane. Do they realise that parents are actually allowed to travel and some will have babies, none of which will have the ability to tell their parent what is wrong, and only be able to cry.\n\nHave some goddamn compassion, offering to help might actually make things better for the parent, as most people forget that while it used to be said that it takes a pair to raise a child, it's now a village that is needed. Helping a struggling parent out will help yourself and the rest of the people around you and them...", "NTA. Babies exist. Babies on planes exist. Babies cry. If someone doesn\u2019t want to deal with a crying baby on a plane, they can bring their own earplugs or headphones.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been on a flight that was at less then 95% capacity.\n\nBabies exist. You did your best to keep crying to a minimum. And there wasn\u2019t mess everywhere.

Air travel is by nature very noisy anyway.", "NTA. Everyone was a screaming baby once.", "NTA. Crying babies are incredibly annoying but it's not something you can stop. It happens, she can deal without being so rude about it. You have a right to travel and exist in public too.\n\nAlso I've dealt with adult humans who are MUCH more obnoxious in public spaces. She sounds like one.", "I would say NTA , \n\nBUT\n\n people in the flight have every right to be upset. This was a 10 hour flight, meaning that a lot of people, including me if i were there, would bet on sleeping through the flight. Having your baby disturb them would mean that they would be tired as hell, making it hard for them to follow their schedule. If they paid good money and took a week of work to go on vacation, them not sleeping on the plane would mean that they would either be tired the whole journey, or miss half the first day in order to replenish their lost sleep. If they were traveling for work, meeting would be even worse. It is not only about making them uncomfortable in the moment, but about what that entails. If I just landed in Rome for example, I would like to leave my laguage and go sightseeing, not go straight top sleep. if i had a meeting, a shift, an interview etc shortly after landing I would be PISSED, cause that would have some real world consequences for me, for instance not performing and not getting the deal job etc. \n\nThat being said, If a baby HAS to travel, of course it will travel. but I personally, would still be mad at you. I wouldn't say anything cause i get that you are doing the best you can, or if i were to say something, I wouldn't phrase it like that passenger, but still rightfully angry.", "ESH.\n\nThe woman who spoke up was rude, but your behaviour sucked. I was totally with you to that point. There is no need to engage someone who is being so confrontational. I understand the urge to tell them off, but in the grand scheme of it all, is it worth it? For the sake of the other passengers, rolling your eyes at her & continuing to the lav was enough. No one likes fussy babies on an airplane, but as noted, the baby can\u2019t help it. You weren\u2019t in first class. You took care of her quickly and it wasn\u2019t like you ignored her. \n\nYou\u2019re *not obligated* in *any* to give people around you \u2018care packages.\u2019 Honestly, while this wouldn\u2019t have helped in your situation, I know I\u2019ve traveled with crayons & a couple colouring books sometimes just in case I was next to a kid. No one is obligated to do any of that stuff, but it\u2019s disconcerting that people expect gifts from parents. (WTF?!)\n\nPeople who berate the parents make the situation worse. All the adults involved just needed to keep their mouths shut. Honestly, it sounds like your baby was very good - especially for such a long flight at that age. I know you were (rightfully) frustrated. My verdict is solely because you kept the exchange going. Are you the worst? Absolutely not.", "I don't have kids. Have chosen not to, but I exist in this world which contains people of all ages. It's my responsibility to coexist with them. NTA. But then my ears hurt on landing, so if I hear a child crying, my instinct is to think, \"poor thing\". \n\nIsn't a care package something you present to someone in a crisis? Not someone so entitled they're forced to share their personal planet with other people. I'd have been applauding you.", "Im a 39 year old woman and i cry during turbulence. Does that mean i need to bring care packages for the rest of the plane?", "NTA", "Wtf.  I've never heard of anything so ridiculous.  I admit it's annoying when a baby cries, but it's what they do.", "ESH. They shouldn\u2019t have been mean bc babies can\u2019t be controlled and you shouldn\u2019t have traveled 10h with a baby unless it was life or death. There\u2019s an unofficial rule on planes to be quiet so I can understand their annoyance", "NTA. You did a great job with easing the entire experience for all involved. The ridiculous notion that having a child instantly means you aren't entitled to use forms of public transport is ridiculous. Your choice of words sounds accurate as well, the other passenger started with the nasty name calling in any case.", "NTA. \n\nFrequent traveler here and let me tell you, there is not much more annoying on a long flight than a loud baby that won\u2019t be quiet. \n\nBut one should never, ever, EVER complain about it.

And that being said, you are f\u2014-ing right your kiddo has the right to occupy the same space!! And from your account, she hardly disrupted the flight at all. A few cries here and there and some screams from turbulence seem standard. Not to mention you were actively trying to keep her calm and quiet. You\u2019re a dang super-mom in my opinion! That person is a miserable human who should have kept quiet. Your infant was far more behaved than a grown adult apparently.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been on many flights that had kids. 1.

Are the parent forbidden to eat to the restaurant too??  \n\n\nThere is a large difference between misbehaving kids due to bad education (which is something that is the parents fault) and kids being kids. While a kid running around in a restaurant and jumping under table is actually a legitimate reason to tell something to the parent , a BABY crying in a flying machine under turbulence that scared adults  isn't , as much as kid laughing and speaking babbling/louder than an adult isn't either.  \n\n  \nIf people want to rest on a plane , they need to understand it's a public place and unless the behavior that annoys them is actually something that can be corrected (exemple a grown ass person listening to a video without headphone or speaking so loud you can hear each detail of their life) , they can just plug in some earplug. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway , NTA , you did good and your baby too because damn I would have been way more scared than her in a plane-", "YTA.\nThe amount of excuses youre giving tells me baby was crying for more than what you think as acceptable.

I doubt that person just lost it on you after such a short time. Sounds like the baby was wailing for a lot longer than you want to admit & for that YTA. Maybe going to a mommy group will give you the validation you so desperately seek.", "NTA she was such an ah but your comment about private jets was too far in my opinion only because it kinda insinuates that only people who are rich deserve quiet and comfort", "YTA can't stand people's screaming procreation in public and noise cancelling headphones don't block out the noise of screaming babies", "NTA.\n\nAnd I love the way you handled those people.\n\nI have sensory issue and I do not have kids, that been said  newborns are humans, they have every right to exist, to fly and whatever. If people do not want new born they can pay for child free space or private jet.

Maybe your words were a tad harsh but I\u2019ve seen some atrocious behave from adults including some cases where they kick off/not allowed to board before takeoff. There\u2019s a weird sense of entitlement when it comes to flying and so long as the caregiver is doing their best than that\u2019s all you can ask for. That 4% is the parents that just let the kids scream and yell (usually the kids that are old enough to know better) \n\nI HATE this trend where parents feel like they need to provide goodies for those around them.

Of course, without taking the culture involved into account, where most people you see are kind and understanding to start with. So in their contexts the treats are just a plus - they are actually respectful between each other no matter what.\n\nThen people transfer that to other contexts where seeing unrespectful behavior is the rule (people pushing the sit in front of them, people cutting others in the boarding line as if they would take off earlier because of that, people treating the flight attendants poorly as if they were not worth of respect, and so on) and just think it is ok to demand treats/gifts and if you didn\u2019t do that, you are a selfish person who dares take a baby onto a plane?

Baby starts getting fussy, my anxiety starts to climb so I was about to walk around with him in the cabin.

Other passengers refused the bags saying they were all parents and had nothing but support for us. I never forgot that flight or her kindness.

So she is just projecting.", "Talk about mama bear!\nYou never mess with a mother and her child.\nOr else fierce angry mama bear comes out ;-;", "Also, one way to greatly increase the chances of a baby getting fussy is to stress the caregiver. Babies can sense the caregiver's stress, and get stressed, and babies deal with stress by fussing or crying. So the passenger was being rude to the other passengers by starting shit.", "Honestly I am so confused by the entitlement people have now adays. Babies are people too. \n\nObviously you don\u2019t want to be subjected to a wailing baby when you\u2019re at a bar or if you\u2019re in a theater or somewhere that should either be for adults only or some expectation of quiet. \n\nBut as for public transport (trains, planes, buses, boats) or even just parks, libraries, restaurants (especially cafes or family restaurants) etc., expect that there will be babies. And it is not their fault if they get jostled by turbulence or startled by screaming. They don\u2019t know any better. And any parent worth their salt is just trying to get through it with some dignity. \n\nNow, I have seen some parents who will unreasonably expect people to make adjustments for unruly behavior or their kids poor behavior.\n\nBut clearly it wasn\u2019t this mom. This mom came with tools and prep to make this a smooth ride. And for a baby only crying 20 minutes total out of a long flight. I would say that\u2019s a win, especially when 15 of those minutes are for turbulence. \n\nOp don\u2019t let the entitled haters tell you that you should apologize for the existence of your child. You already did what was reasonably possible to mitigate stressors for your kid. You\u2019ve done all you can do and you did great. NTA", "If people want to be free of all possible unpleasantness from the existence of other travelers, they should be flying private. Can\u2019t afford that? Well guess you have to use public transportation with the rest of us peasants.", "Right? When travelling with an infant my focus is on my actual infant, not all the grown-up babies around me.", "Agreed. I mean, the AIRPLANES are supposed to supply earplugs to passengers already, free. Why should frazzled parents have to do it?", "it's a trend??'  wtf is this? i take dozens of flights a year i never heard of it before this post.", "Yes!  I've been handed little care packages multiple times over the years when I flew constantly for work.  I traveled steadily from 2009 - 2015 and received everything from snacks and earplugs to a $10 starbucks gift card to one of those really nice neck pillows.  I always refused because I had my own ear plugs and I don't need to be paid to not act like an asshole.", "this lady must have seen a viral post on facebook and now thinks its what she deserves every time she has to endure the horror of sharing space with a baby.", "Yeah, my dad and I got stuck next to this annoying little punks (old enough to be told no) who kept kicking our seats and no care packages were handed out. I didn't know we should have felt slighted lol", "it's really one of my favourite words but I don't want it to be a regular in baby's vocab so i'm weaning myself off it hahaha", "Same:\n\nMy opinion is that if you are an adult - it\u2019s your responsibility to have noise canceling headphones on flights.", "I mean, stuff like handing out say earplugs and maybe a piece of candy will help smooth any ruffled feathers if the pain of the air pressure change causes the baby to start to cry nonstop.", "Let's NEVER normalize that word. It's offensive no matter what or where.\n Just my opinion, don't call me names!", "I think most people conveniently forget that we are all former babies. I enjoy your wording a lot!", "I too am a former baby, one who (I am told) screamed from Tokyo to LA because it turned out I had an ear infection, and if you've ever flown with a fluid filled ear or sinus cavity, you understand why I was screaming. I was six months old. I did not have the life experience to know that the agony would eventually end. \n\nI have spent the rest of my life doing penance by reassuring people that their baby is allowed to exist and make baby sounds even if it is on an airplane.", "Why isn\u2019t this the top comment?! An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind\n\nESH!", "This.", "I had two babies crying on my last flight (I swear they were egging each other on). So I put on my own noise cancelling earphones because I'm a functioning adult that recognizes that if I want peace while traveling, that's on me to figure out. It's wild how people expect strangers to coddle them instead of learning to take care of crap themselves.", "\"Rightfully angry\" - lol. It's public transportation. You're not entitled to a perfectly quiet, peaceful experience when you're stuffed in a tube with a couple hundred other individual humans and it's remarkable that you think you would be. If you're not making plans that take jetlag, delays, turbulence, and the existence of other passengers into account, that's on you. These are just realities of modern air travel, but oooohhh I might have to *take a nap* after being safely transported to the other side of an ocean or continent in less than a day, it's so unfair!\n\nThis mentality is more childish than the actual baby is. Good grief.", "Then wear ear plugs or noise cancelling headphones. You can't expect a public space like an airplane to be completely silent for your convenience. What do you expect this parent to do, smother their child?? All humans make noise, whether they are infants or adults. If you want complete silence, don't use a mode of transportation that is open to everyone. Book a private charter. The world doesn't revolve around you.", "Bring ear plugs/headphones. People snore, people cough/sneeze even talk in their sleep,  babies cry.", "I may not agree with the verdict, but you phrased it very well. \n\nI personally wouldn't say anything, but I think OP stepped into A H territory when she made her baby laugh loudly. That isn't trying to keep baby calm and quiet and it certainly isn't respectful to other passengers.", "I am definitely a when the go low, I go lower kind of gal but I can see why you might say this. Thanks", "I mean\u2026if there\u2019s booze or special brownies in the bag I wouldn\u2019t turn them down\u2026", "You don\u2019t stop traveling just because you have kids. Thats unreasonable.", "This is a completely ridiculous statement. There are plenty of valid reasons why traveling with a baby is necessary.", "Get over it. Making noise *is* existing. Babies need to travel sometimes too.", "It was the \"loud laughter\" bit that got me. I can understand breastfeeding (even if I personally don't want to see it.. I can ignore it), I can understand a few minutes of crying.. But purposefully making noise? Like.. Babies are loud and I don't want to hear that more than I have to in any place.\n\nYou couldn't do anything to soothe your child for 15 minutes?", "Op is allowed to travel with her child. Guess what kids cry. Don\u2019t go anywhere that you could possibly be stuck near a child.", "And why bring a baby on a 10 hour flight anyway?", "So you expect children to be locked in their homes 24/7? Babies are people too and have just as much a right to occupy public spaces as you do. If you can't handle it, maybe you're the one who should stay home. This mother did her best to keep her baby quiet, and short of smothering her there isn't really anything else she could have done.", "I have a feeling that you are not mature enough to be in public spaces.", "I didn't know that - suppose that makes sense though. thanks for the feedback!", "I completely agree and honestly more people need to realize planes are a form of public transport. A very expensive one sometimes, but still public transport. When you use public transport the public tends to be there", "Nooooo, use it with pride! Baby will learn all kinds of other things you don\u2019t want them to learn, what\u2019s one more?\n\nGenuinely, though - NTA and I freaking hate people like that. Babies are people too, and half the time whatever is making them cry is something I also hate, so know that for every person like her there\u2019s probably also somebody silently commiserating with your baby and wishing they could cry, too.", "Sure, but who goes on a plane without headphones these days though?", "Try to tell that to the entire continent of Australia", "Clearly you've not been to Ireland.", "That is a very US centric viewpoint and a wrong one at that. I\u2019d recommend doing some research before making blanket statements under the guise of your \u201copinion.\u201d", "That\u2019s just not true. There are plenty of places and times where it\u2019s not offensive.", "Offensive to you perhaps.", "Best word ever if ou ask me", "that's why i voted nta, dummy,\n\nbut still, to the extent that it affects me it is annoying.", ">. People snore, people cough/sneeze even talk in their sleep\n\nI would me mad at the mad well, of course wouldn't say anything. there is this concept called \"necessary evil\". It is when something bad but, inevitable happens. Of course there will be noise it a plane. If it disturbs my sleep i will not be happy about it. But still can't demand total silence. I am not saying that people who snore, babies parents etc etc are assholes( thus the nta verdict, look at the  top of the comment) but i still can be pissed about the inconvenience.", "Oh, honestly? Naturally, I totally am as well. I\u2019ve actively worked to not do it. \ud83d\ude02 That\u2019s why I say: I completely understand the urge/where you\u2019re coming from!", "I dont drink or partake in special brownies. If i drank id just put myself to sleep with booze. Cheaper than handing it out to everyone else!", "Making your baby laugh keeps them engaged and not wailing. Laughter is way easier on the ears and nerves than wailing. There are absolutely times when babies can't be soothed no matter what you do,  for 15 minutes.  This baby was scared by adults screaming,  turbulence and op was probably stressed.", "I was on a 7 hours flight a few days ago and there was a 18 months old right behind me and a tiny baby next to my boyfriend. The 18 months was very excited before take off and hitting the back of my seat. His mother explained not to hit the lady's seat, so I turned around and waved to the little one. He laughed. He tried to stand up, holding on to my seat during take-off, I told him we all need to sit, his mom helped him sit back down. Honestly, after that, I put my headphones and I didn't hear the kiddo. You did your very best. NTA.", "And UK & Ireland", "Or Scotland", "American here, c*** is my favorite word, we have a lot of them \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Or the North of England"]}
