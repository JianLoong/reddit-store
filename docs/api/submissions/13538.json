He would buy nothing for her, pay her no alimony, and she would provide her own utilities and vehicle.

I\u2019m not taking you you\u2019ll go to jail for crying\u201d along with some other unhinged comments. \n\nI called the cops after discussing with DH. I showed the video.

I won\u2019t allow her to do this to them anymore. \n\nShe did answer almost 24 hours later and called me a sanctimonious every word under the Sun and really laid in.

Honestly, kudos to you for not just reporting but giving them a real home and stable life. \n\nAlso sounds like ex is being led on with lies.", "You are NTA!

Until then, thank you for being a wonderful human and aunt.", "NTA. Her ex by offering all those things to her you can tell he's still under her influence, even after all this time. Thank you for doing right by these children. The state does not like to take responsibility over children, and so they only did so because of the clear neglect and abuse suffered by those kids. Good luck to you moving forward; she doesn't deserve the time of day. Don't sugarcoat her behavior to the kids, either; they need to understand that is incorrect behavior.", "NTA..first of all, she made this your & your husband's situation by constantly dropping off her kids to your house with no prior warning just expecting that you'll watch the kids because as you said \"you have no say\" which is extremely entitled that she felt it was ok just to drop off her kids without even asking you if it was ok first hand. But that opened the door to seeing what else was really going on. She's verbally/mentally & emotionally abusing them & as well as not providing them basic essentials that they need, such as food & coats that would be weather appropriate. You had every right to get involved since she involved you & your husband. You are doing what's best for the children first. She's obviously not in the best place to take care of those kids & those kids shouldn't have to pay because their mother can't or won't take care of them.", "NTA. All that matters here are the kids and you are quite literally saving their lives. You don\u2019t owe an explanation to the ex but it\u2019s almost certain that your SIL fed him a bunch of lies and he is unaware of the actual situation. \n\nYou\u2019re awesome for getting those kids out of a horrible environment!", "NTA, you didn\u2019t force her to continually abandon and neglect her children.", "NTA, though I get the feeling that your SIL called her ex and gave some sob story to get him on her side.", "NTA. Your sister is an AH parent for neglecting and abandoning her own children. You and DH are being very gracious taking them in. Those kids are lucky to have you.", "NTA. You did right by the kids. I have a feeling her ex is getting an edited version of the story.", "Definetly NAH, you did the right thing and by the sounds of it you're in a position to give those kids a good life. \n\nI would ask the ex though why he thinks the way he does though as it sounds like he was trying to do right by them but didn't know what was going on. \n\nHopefully you can co parent with him and the kids get a food life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thank goodness nothing ever happened to those poor kids.\n\nAlso, there's no way the ex was given the full story.

I won't even leave a stranger's kid like that, not even the kid of my worst enemy, heck even the mafia and gangs don't touch children and here you have you SIL leaving them alone in front of a porch like that. \n\nAlso, the ex-husband of SIL is either fed some strange lie by your SIL or is probably worried that he'll lose any bond with the kids.

People like her should not be having kids.", "Yeah its gonna be tough but it is the right thing to do and op should let nobody convince her that this was the wrong choice,ever, the children will thank her soon enough when theyre old enough to realize what happened in their childhood.", ">Surprisingly her ex contacted me, told me I was wrong and an ah for \u201cstealing\u201d her children. \n\nIf he gets custody, nothing stops him from returning the kids to bio mom....", "Don't think he still has custody after the divorce. Otherwise he could have been in their lifes.", "Not every state/country follows the \u201cborn during the marriage, makes him their legal parent.\u201d So be cautious with giving this advice out.", "OP should offer him a chance to be dad again. It was important to him at one stage. Maybe it will help the kids?", "Exactly. NTA", "Wait and see. Often there are decisions regarding visitation during court hearings for custody.", "Is this your husbands sister?", "You might want to have your lawyer contact him & supply him with all the info &  videos.", "Ooof, I'm so sorry, that's really not good news... \n\nI would suggest (if you haven't already done so) that you look into family counselling asap and also take every last inch of support from CPS and social services. And look into support that might be available for foster parents with challenging placements. (you're a kinship placement but hopefully can access similar support). \n\nIs ex the named father on the birth certificate? Does he want to be involved? Would you welcome this? Tbh, anyone who reacts the way he did isn't thinking rationally about the situation.", "So she is your hubby's sister? I get confused how she is related to you.", "The answer is probably drugs.", "I don't blame you. Whatever is lacking in her character has been lacking since before she was a parent is my guess. She was out and about having kids with someone or more than one someone throughout her marriage for how long? Selfish is probably the nicest word I'd use. It would be hard to trust that she'll be able to change any time soon. The kids are so lucky to have you and DH. Thank you.", "Sound's a lot like my mother what you have been describing here, just trust me even tough it is tough and you didnt plan for this, it is the right thing to do.\n\nDont let anyone discomfort you about your decision, the children deserve better and i am sure youre able to provide that.", "May sound weird, but don't try to be mom. Be their aunt who raises them, loves them and protects them. That's what they need. Tell them the truth about what / why everything happened in an age appropriate way. And if possible get them in therapy (not the baby, the older kids). Good luck to the kids, you and hubby.", "You know what, I had children on purpose and I still don't know what I'm doing. As long as you want what's best for them, that counts for a lot. It's okay to have a lot of mixed emotions right now, this is a lot to process. But they will be safe with you, and from the bottom of my heart I am grateful there are people like you out there.", "You've got money. Get a nanny, put the kids in therapy. Do individual and family therapy. Get some parenting books..\n\nYou'll be fine. Boundaries, stability and love- they'll be okay.", "Wanting to give them a good life is more than they've ever had before.  You're getting thrown in the deep end for sure, but you're as qualified as any of us were when we started.  Love and their best interests at heart is the core of parenting, and you're already better at it than their mother.", "They need love and security and you and your husband will give them that. Everything else will come with time.", "If CPS has a no contact order, that would be a stopper.\n\nI missed the part about the ex on the mom's side.  Yeah, two unfit parents.  Time for CPS to begin the process of stabilizing the kids.", "Not clear that he isn't their legal father.", "I thought so to. Invite him over and explain the situation to him and show him all the videos. I'm sure your sister has told him all kind of crap.", "I doubt not-dad will fight for custody.  Seems like he mostly wants to be Fun Uncle for a Saturday afternoon and/or put on a show of what a Good Person he is by still interacting with the children of his marriage, even though they're not biologically his.  If he wanted custody, or legitimately thought OP had overstepped, he'd be the doorstep the kids got dumped on.", "Most kids, still love their parents and want to be with them, even in the worst situations. I'm really concerned about that comment.  I hope that it it just that the kids have already bonded with OP and her husband and the grandparents...", "I took in my cousins kids in a similar situation last year. The expectations for family placement vs an outside party foster are significantly less stringent because it benefits CPS to keep kids within the family", "If you've got lots of Lego but never stepped on a stranded Lego brick while you're barefoot, your home screams childfree.", "Everything you cherish and is reachable by the two youngest: find a safe place (upper board, closed off room). Electricity outlets - make them child safe, also stairs. Fish pond, water tank in the yard? Cover them child safe. Everything else you will figure out with every new milestone \ud83e\udd23"]}
