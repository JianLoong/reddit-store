He was devastated, but still offered to be their dad and co parent. He even offered to pay her mortgage on her new home and buy all groceries, his stipulations were she would never touch his money and he would do the shopping with the kids any time they needed.  He would buy nothing for her, pay her no alimony, and she would provide her own utilities and vehicle. She didn\u2019t like that she would have no control over his money anymore and tried to sue for alimony. She lost. However, since he is not their father she won\u2019t allow him in their lives. \n\nSo I think that gives sufficient background. Onto what\u2019s happening. Since she lost the proceedings she has had a habit of dropping the kids off without telling myself, my husband, or even the maid who comes twice a week. It\u2019s been going on this way for two years with an infant in the mix now. She said it\u2019s because she only has a two bedroom apartment and that we\u2019re family so we don\u2019t get a say. \n\nI usually work from home but had an in office week to visit a new property my company owns. I got a call from my house keeper that 3 young children and a baby were crying on my porch in the rain. I checked my camera. Offered my housekeeper $500 to watch them for 1 hour while I wrapped up. \n\nI got home. Called DH and told him to watch the video. It was SIL bringing kids to the door with literally nothing. No diaper bag, no backpack, no coats. 9 yo starts crying \u201cstfu or auntie nacho won\u2019t watch you for this week. I\u2019m not taking you you\u2019ll go to jail for crying\u201d along with some other unhinged comments. \n\nI called the cops after discussing with DH. I showed the video. Showed several prior unknown drop offs and asked if this counted as abandonment. Her 7 & 9 yo also said that hasn\u2019t eaten anything but crackers and water and the baby was only getting instant breakfast. \n\nThe kids are now in a state facility until our home is inspected for placement. (Tomorrow thank goodness.)  I text SIL and told her this was the last straw and I\u2019ve already obtained a lawyer to gain custody of the children. I won\u2019t allow her to do this to them anymore. \n\nShe did answer almost 24 hours later and called me a sanctimonious every word under the Sun and really laid in. She said I was just jealous I\u2019m old and will produce no children. (We were child free by choice however I WILL NOT allow further abuse of these innocent children.) \n\nHer own family is against and told her at least I will be a mother. Surprisingly her ex contacted me, told me I was wrong and an ah for \u201cstealing\u201d her children. I was very confused about that.

Definitely an asshole. Considering that this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s literally dumped her kids on your front porch, I do agree that it would be grounds for abandonment.\n\nI don\u2019t know why her ex called you an AH.

Perhaps you\u2019ll be able to clear the air and you could ask if he\u2019d like to visit them. They may not be his kids biologically, but it sounds like he still deeply cares about them.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds like a piece of work. Kudos to you for stepping up to take in the kids. Why would your ex-BIL take her side after everything she put him through, though?", "Very much NTA. \n\nWow. You are saving these kids from an all around terrible situation. Honestly, kudos to you for not just reporting but giving them a real home and stable life. \n\nAlso sounds like ex is being led on with lies.", "You are NTA! No matter what anyone says ever you protect children. Also did the ex know what was really going on or did she lie to play victim. Good job saving those kids!", "NTA. Those kids have such stellar bio parents.", "NTA - don't worry I firmly believe you are right too. You are a saint and have gone above and beyond to care for the innocent children from a toxic and abusive parent who is obviously not interested in taking care of them.\n\n>Surprisingly her ex contacted me, told me I was wrong and an ah for \u201cstealing\u201d her children.\n\nSend him the videos, maybe he'll understand.", "NTA You are a wonderful, caring person, and those kids are lucky that you\u2019re in their lives. \n\nTheir biological mother is horrible. I hope that she stays away from y\u2019all, and that she lets you and your husband raise your children in a stable, loving home. I wish y\u2019all well.", "NTA, you are not stealing her kids you are protecting them - which is actually her job, that she isn't capable of doing at this time. \n\nMaybe if she gets the help and support she needs, she'll be ready to parent. Until then, thank you for being a wonderful human and aunt.", "NTA. Her ex by offering all those things to her you can tell he's still under her influence, even after all this time. Thank you for doing right by these children. The state does not like to take responsibility over children, and so they only did so because of the clear neglect and abuse suffered by those kids. Good luck to you moving forward; she doesn't deserve the time of day. Don't sugarcoat her behavior to the kids, either; they need to understand that is incorrect behavior.", "NTA..first of all, she made this your & your husband's situation by constantly dropping off her kids to your house with no prior warning just expecting that you'll watch the kids because as you said \"you have no say\" which is extremely entitled that she felt it was ok just to drop off her kids without even asking you if it was ok first hand. But that opened the door to seeing what else was really going on. She's verbally/mentally & emotionally abusing them & as well as not providing them basic essentials that they need, such as food & coats that would be weather appropriate. You had every right to get involved since she involved you & your husband. You are doing what's best for the children first. She's obviously not in the best place to take care of those kids & those kids shouldn't have to pay because their mother can't or won't take care of them.", "NTA. All that matters here are the kids and you are quite literally saving their lives. You don\u2019t owe an explanation to the ex but it\u2019s almost certain that your SIL fed him a bunch of lies and he is unaware of the actual situation. \n\nYou\u2019re awesome for getting those kids out of a horrible environment!", "NTA, you didn\u2019t force her to continually abandon and neglect her children.", "NTA, though I get the feeling that your SIL called her ex and gave some sob story to get him on her side.", "NTA. Your sister is an AH parent for neglecting and abandoning her own children. You and DH are being very gracious taking them in. Those kids are lucky to have you.", "NTA. You did right by the kids. I have a feeling her ex is getting an edited version of the story.", "Definetly NAH, you did the right thing and by the sounds of it you're in a position to give those kids a good life. \n\nI would ask the ex though why he thinks the way he does though as it sounds like he was trying to do right by them but didn't know what was going on. \n\nHopefully you can co parent with him and the kids get a food life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No kid deserves that, at all, ever.", "NTA, but you are a bigger person than me, I would be forwarding that drop off video to anyone that gave me guff.  Then tell them that no one was home.  \n\n\nOn another note, in all the old times stories, little kids are abandoned on front porches and doorsteps in hope they will be taken in so based on those, you were given these children.

The courts generally try to keep the children with their parents.

Those kids need someone to properly care for them, and their mother surely wasn't. ...Plus abandoning your kids on someone's doorstep and then fleeing?! Thank goodness nothing ever happened to those poor kids.\n\nAlso, there's no way the ex was given the full story. Considering how much the ex cared about the kids, in spite of them not being his bio kids and the circumstances behind them being brought into this world, there's absolutely no way he knows what actually happened. \n\nI hope OP reaches out to the ex and explains things. The kids probably will want to maintain a relationship with him, sounds like he was the only parental figure they ever had, other than OP.", "I will.

However, I WANT to give them a good life. To do this I\u2019ve got to be a mom right? I don\u2019t know how. There 3 under 10 yo and a literal infant. She\u2019s only 11 months.

I\u2019ve gotten zero sleep.", "you will be fine just be honest and a house is spotless\n\nbut a home has stuff, as long as the house is clean clear you will be fine.", "I'm guessing she simply lied about what really happend.  \nProbably some story about you agreed to watch them for an hour and called CPS on her without a reason.", "I just don\u2019t want it to seem sterile. We never planned on children. I mean my DH has DND and Lego stuff all over. Lol. I don\u2019t know how my office set up will fly since it used to be the den but has my work and gaming stuff.", "So?

That sounds like a fun home :) kids should love it, the lego always, and the dnd once they get a bit older.\nEdit; the 9 year old might actually be old enough to start enjoying short campaigns.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll deny you because you\u2019ve got lots of Lego and DND stuff. They\u2019ll be looking for if you have enough rooms and overall condition of the house. Anything else they\u2019ll likely approve but ask for minor changes to make it safer.", "You\u2019ll sort out the details as you go. They know it is an emergency placement for multiple children. They only care that the house has food, working utilities, no mold or rotten garbage, enough space that kids will have bedrooms with beds. They\u2019re not going to judge your LEGO collection; they\u2019ve left kids in far worse situations than \u201cparent has lots of LEGO\u201d\n\nMentally prepare yourself to find out from the kids that their home life was worse than you ever knew. It\u2019s ok that you didn\u2019t know.

It sounds to me like you are acting in their best interests when nobody else will.", "NTA. A part of me believes she doesn\u2019t really care that she\u2019s losing custody of her kids. She knows they will be in good hands and she won\u2019t have to be bothered to mother them. This is so messed up.

Though, if I was him, I wouldn't believe anything she says but that's neither here nor there. What she was doing was absolutely abandonment and abusive. Thank you for being someone the kids can rely on.", "Girl, you are saving these kids from a neglectful and seemingly unhinged mother.

YOU SAVED THESE CHILDREN\u2026 Thank you for stepping up too many people ignore child abuse\n\nBest of luck with the inspection, no doubt you two succeed with flying colours", "As much as our society tends to forget it in basically every aspect of how we treat them it's important to remember that children are in fact people and people are not property.", "Right! He\u2019s been told some baloney story about what happened.", "SIL probably lied honestly and said you were stealing her children. NTA op", "Oh my, this comment just broke my heart. No child should be that upset to go home, unless the home they live in is abusive.", "It\u2019s one thing to not want your own bio children.

We\u2019re all winging it!", "The case worker said the same thing and I\u2019m so afraid. Her own mother already disowned her. My DH said she\u2019s trespassing and will have her arrested if he sees just a glimpse of her near the family store or our home. I never knew I could truly hate. Here we are though.
