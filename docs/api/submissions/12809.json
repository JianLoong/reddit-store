Maybe the guy should drive his RV to go pick up the food instead of having it be delivered to random addresses.", "NTA\n\nHe placed an order and had it delivered to YOUR house for no reason. He didn't clear it with you and you don't know him. There was no way you could have possibly known it was for him/belonged to him.", "Nta\n\nHe chose to send it to your house. If he's parked in an rv, and he just chose to use your house, it means he doesn't actually know anyone in that neighborhood, so maybe he should park near someone that he knows house.", "NTA. If he wanted to use your address, he could have asked your permission.", "NTA. \"Joe\" had it delivered to your house without permission. It's simple enough to have it delivered to the RV. Yes, I'm aware some drivers don't bother reading the instructions. \n\nI hope it was good food.", "NTA, I would\u2019ve done the same thing. If there\u2019s a bag of fresh food on my doorstep that must be god giving me one hell of a gift. Savor that Chinese food, the man will get a refund and move on.", "What in the actual fuck? Some random dude parked by your house and used your address for food delivery? Hell no. There should be absolutely no interaction with a random stranger at Your House. Eat the food and don't think twice. \n\nNTA", "All he has to do is contact DoorDash and they will rectify it. And he can leave delivery instructions that say \u201cIn the RV that is parked on street.\u201d This was, and is, not on you. Enjoy your gift from the universe.", "NTA. It was delivered to YOUR house. He put in your address without checking if it was okay with you first. The food is yours", "Tough call here. Why would someone you don\u2019t know have food delivered to your house? That\u2019s weird.\n\n\u2018Definitely NTA for eating the food because it was intended for you apparently but no, do not engage with this person in the RV in any way to give money or for any other reason\u2026\n\n\u2018This sounds really sus and sketchy and if this RV person ordered food, then they should pay for it...But exercise caution and contact DoorDash and leave the food outside if this should happen again because something about this doesn\u2019t seem right\u2026", "NTA - if he was going to do that he needed to tell you.", "NTA  \nits the guys own fault for having food delivered to NOT his own place. he could have givin' the doordash instructions that it was to be delivered to the RV instead of your door. also he could have gone and picked up food to avoid this kinda problem", "NTA.\n\nAccounting for this is baked into Door Dash's system. It's incredibly easy for the person who actually ordered the food to get a replacement at no cost. (unless it's around closing time), and Door Dash also gives you more than enough tools to specify where you are and how to get the food to you. For example: \"I'm in the RV in front of this house.\" Or: \"I'm at extension 1099 at the front door.\"", "NTA. But now you know it was his food, I\u2019d reimburse him, but tell him not to order food to your house again or it\u2019s fair game.", "INFO what was \"a while\"", "NTA, i would\u2019ve done the same honestly but i think you should give him the money because he paid for it and you just ate it", "People should not be allowed to live on the street in RV's. It should be illegal to be parking in front of people's houses. I would tell that guy to go park in an RV park since he has so much money to be ordering Doordash or ask them for a refund and tell him to let it be a learning experience to not be using other people's addresses and not put directions down . I hate that. Tell him to go park at Walmart or Planet Fitness like a normal person!", "NTA, personally I\u2019d give him like $5-$10 back since doordash likely won\u2019t refund him in this instance as the food was delivered to the correct address. But I can also understand not wanting to give him any money.", "How long did you wait? If like 5 minutes then YTA. But if it was a reasonable amount of time for the driver to realize their mistake (had there been one)  and come back or even the RV dude to come over and get his food then I say NTA. \n\nAlthough RV dude would have been smart to say something or give some kind of heads up (or just ask??) What\u2019s next? Using your address to send his mail?", "How long did you wait before eating it?", "ESH\nRV dude sucks for ordering food delivery to a strangers home. You suck for eating food that wasn\u2019t yours and then refusing to reimburse the person who paid for it.", "I guess I have an unpopular opinion but I say YTA. You didn\u2019t order the food, you didn\u2019t pay for the food, it\u2019s entirely reasonable that it could have been a mistake by the driver or accident in entering the address and either the driver or customer might come looking for it. Waiting 10 minutes is not long enough, 30 minutes would be more acceptable.", "I'm a little torn on this one. It's definitely a bit of an A H move to eat someone else's food that you didn't pay for. However, you have no idea whose food it is and it would be shitty to let it go to waste. Now that you know whose food it was I think you should reimburse him. I'm not sure exactly how it works, but I think if the driver has proof that he delivered the food to the right address the guy won't get reimbursed through doordash. NTA, but I think you should pay him back for the food.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's using YOUR ADDRESS, what the fuck does he think will happen?", "NTA.", "Admittedly I dont know enough about your relationship with the RV guy, but maybe he was trying to be nice and have food delivered as his way of saying thanks for letting him stay on your street? How was that succulent Chinese meal?", "Why wouldn't RV lurker have put instructions on the order to deliver the food to the RV outside of the address.", "Or at the very least... like you can literally see the realtime progress of where the driver is! I understand giving a nearby physical address when you're in an RV that isn't easily used as a delivery location. But in that case you've gotta know the risks and be tracking the progress so you can make sure to be standing right outside to meet the driver!", "[deleted]", "Edit: never mind I misread the post. \n\nSince the dude lives \u201cin the tv park next door\u201d it could likely be that the address got kid-entered.
