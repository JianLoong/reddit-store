Why would someone you don\u2019t know have food delivered to your house? That\u2019s weird.\n\n\u2018Definitely NTA for eating the food because it was intended for you apparently but no, do not engage with this person in the RV in any way to give money or for any other reason\u2026\n\n\u2018This sounds really sus and sketchy and if this RV person ordered food, then they should pay for it...But exercise caution and contact DoorDash and leave the food outside if this should happen again because something about this doesn\u2019t seem right\u2026", "NTA - if he was going to do that he needed to tell you.", "NTA  \nits the guys own fault for having food delivered to NOT his own place. he could have givin' the doordash instructions that it was to be delivered to the RV instead of your door. also he could have gone and picked up food to avoid this kinda problem", "NTA.\n\nAccounting for this is baked into Door Dash's system. It's incredibly easy for the person who actually ordered the food to get a replacement at no cost. (unless it's around closing time), and Door Dash also gives you more than enough tools to specify where you are and how to get the food to you. For example: \"I'm in the RV in front of this house.\" Or: \"I'm at extension 1099 at the front door.\"", "NTA.

I hate that. Tell him to go park at Walmart or Planet Fitness like a normal person!", "NTA, personally I\u2019d give him like $5-$10 back since doordash likely won\u2019t refund him in this instance as the food was delivered to the correct address.

What\u2019s next? Using your address to send his mail?\n\nETA: I didn\u2019t know that once doordash is delivered then it\u2019s written off, wrong address or not, so I say NTA all around.

You suck for eating food that wasn\u2019t yours and then refusing to reimburse the person who paid for it.", "I guess I have an unpopular opinion but I say YTA. You didn\u2019t order the food, you didn\u2019t pay for the food, it\u2019s entirely reasonable that it could have been a mistake by the driver or accident in entering the address and either the driver or customer might come looking for it. Waiting 10 minutes is not long enough, 30 minutes would be more acceptable.", "I'm a little torn on this one. It's definitely a bit of an A H move to eat someone else's food that you didn't pay for. However, you have no idea whose food it is and it would be shitty to let it go to waste. Now that you know whose food it was I think you should reimburse him. I'm not sure exactly how it works, but I think if the driver has proof that he delivered the food to the right address the guy won't get reimbursed through doordash.

You made a reasonable effort to see if it was your tenant's. But, personally, I'd give the guy his money back. You DID eat his food.

OP has no responsibility to RV guy. NTA.", "Nah, OP has no responsibility to a stranger who used their address with no heads up. Plus, DoorDash can\u2019t re-deliver the food once it\u2019s at the wrong place, that\u2019s not allowed for food safety reasons.

But I would still feel pretty shitty about it. Realistically, he did eat food he didn't pay for. You're 100% right that it's not on him, but I still think it's the right thing to do. \n\nMaybe this is more a NAH situation? He's not an asshole for eating it, wouldn't *technically* be an asshole for not giving the guy the money, and the RV guy isn't an asshole either unless he was a big jerk to OP about it.", "YTA. never eat someone else\u2019s food! \n\nNever eat food you didn\u2019t order! what if it had been poisoned?! \n\nI\u2019ve always left food outside if it\u2019s been delivered to me by accident. just leave it be. \n\nNow that you KNOW who\u2019s food it was, you really should offer to buy him replacement food or pay him back", "NTA\n\nAny food delivered to your house by someone else without your consent is up for grabs", "NTA\n\n\"Should I give him money for the food?\"\n\nNo, he shouldn't order food to your address without asking you, that's just bizarre.\n\nP.s. Bon app\u00e9tit.", "I wouldn\u2019t want anyone doing anything that allows them to create any kind of paper trail to my home.  Squatters rights happen way to often and someone starting small establishing that they get their stuff at your home is a good start.", "If you took the food inside and call the restaurant they will tell you to keep it. They can't take it back. Sucks for him but he should've been waiting outside although I find it kinda peculiar that you picked it up since it clearly wasn't for anyone living in the house. I had this situation once and the bag had our address but no name, if the name was someone not living in my house I wouldve probably left it.", "Why would he get a refund if it was delivered to the exact address he specified?", "Definitely a scam.", "Do you both realize I edited (immediately after the fact) to post that I realized I misread it? I already admitted I was wrong.", "Quite possible. I use the service fairly regularly, and one thing I've noticed is that maybe one driver in twenty, tops, bothers to read the delivery instructions.", "Well that's a rabbit hole I didn't expect to stumble into at work.", "It sucks. My road is mapped and everything, but only DD and Grub Hub will deliver to me because I'm in a bad area, so the actual local places with delivery don't deliver to me."]}
