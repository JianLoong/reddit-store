We have been dating since we were 18 and 19, and we both have broken families nowadays. \n\nMy parents got a divorce when I was 20, because my father cheated on my mom with our neighbour. My mom naturally was devastated and she had some really rough years after the divorce. During those years me and my mom grew closer than we've ever been, and now she's one of my best friends. However, I've had very little contact with my father after the divorce. I found his acts unforgettable and disgusting, so I decided not to reach out as much. I haven't asked him for any money since I was 15, but he still sends me some every now and then (nothing huge, 200-300\u20ac about twice a year). I think he does this because he feels guilty.\n\nBoth of my fiance's parents have remarried and I've spent quite a lot of time with their new spouses. We're inviting both of my fiance's parents and their new spouses to our wedding. My mom has been dating a new man for a little over two years. Both me and my fiance have met him, and he's nice. He makes my mom happy and that's all that matters to me. My dad continued dating the neighbour after the divorce. I've never spoken to the woman, and neither has my fiance. I've seen her a few times due to her being our neighbour, but I've never said a word to this woman and she's a complete stranger to me. I also have some hatred and resentment towards her, since she's the reason my parents broke up. I know that it's not complete her fault and my dad's to blame as well, but the neighbour knew my parents were married and that they have kids. I have a hard time understanding why she would break up a family like that. \n\nEven though I have very little contact with my dad, I've decided to invite him to our wedding. He is not going to walk me up the aisle or be a big part of the wedding, he is simply a guest. I felt it would be too cruel to not invite him, and I was also scared I would regret not inviting him. His invite said nothing about an avec, only his name.\n\nHe texted me a few days ago asking if his new partner, the neighbour, can come to the wedding with him. I answered nicely and calmly, that I only invited him to the wedding since he is my family and I want him to see my big day. He got upset that I didn't extend the invite to his new partner. He claims that it's gonna be awkward if he comes alone since he doesn't know our other guests.\n\nI do not want his new partner to our wedding. The woman is a complete stranger to me, so why would I want her there? I also see her as a cold and evil type of person, due to her acts in the past. I also want my mom to enjoy my wedding and have fun there, and it's going to be difficult if the neighbour's there. \n\nAm I being cruel for inviting all of the other partners of our parent's, but not my father's? \n\nI apologize for any grammar mistakes there might be, English isn't my first language.", "created_utc": 1676924350, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117jct7/aita_for_not_inviting_my_fathers_new_partner_to/", "score": 317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Moving on is actually accepting your father is a VERY flawed individual, who made a HUGE fucking mistake.

But just out of curiosity then... how long did the affair last before your dad divorced your mother? Because if it's only been for six years, seems like the marriage ended pretty much when he started dating the neighbor.

But I don't think my wedding is the right time and place to do that.", "For all I know, my father was cheating for about 6 months before the divorce. My mom wanted a divorce immediately when she found out. You're correct, my math was wrong and their relationship has probably lasted for about 6,5 years by now.

You have plenty of time to meet her and get to know her.  What's stopping you?", "No. I just understand people get hurt and that some parts of their heart will never fully heal. You should try to be empathetic.", "The fact than she has made zero effort on getting to know me or meeting me. Honestly, I don't even know if she wants to come to the wedding. It's obvious my father wants her there, but I don't know if she cares at all about me or my wedding.", "Nta but it was a bad idea inviting him in the first place.", "NTA. Actions have consequences, that can be far reaching and show up years later. He's lucky he's getting an invite after showing he doesn't know what marriage means.", "NTA Their relationship has personally brought you pain. Why would you invite pain to your wedding?", "I have never seen the term avec used on an invite, it\u2019s interesting,and it makes sense because it means with. As for your wedding you are NTA or being cruel . It\u2019s your wedding, and you can invite whoever you want. Frankly, your dad should just be glad he got an invite, I don\u2019t think I would be as kind if it were me. Your in-laws,their spouse, and your mom\u2019s bf are all people you like, know and are comfortable with, so it makes sense inviting them. And it makes total sense not to invite someone you don\u2019t know, and resent because of her part in ending your parents marriage.", "Well, now it will be in my weeding, lol, because I LOVE it.", "She lives next door how would she not know they weren\u2019t separated", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding so you get to decide who is invited. If your dad decides not to attend because his affair partner isn't invited then that's his choice.", "NTA. Quite simply it comes down to it's your wedding and thus you get to select the guests. If you don't want this woman there then it's your right not to invite her. Of course you dad is going to be unhappy, but that isn't your fault.", "NAH. You get to invite whomever you want to your wedding.  However actions have consequences and this might mean your dad doesn't go and/or create a larger rift in your relationship.  \n\nI get that it might be easier to blame a stranger, but your father is the one to blame for his infidelity and breaking up your family.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I would have no problem stating that he is invited because he is my dad, and I want to love him in spite of his flaws. I would tell him I will not support the betrayal of my mom by him and the (call her what she is, it starts with a W) to take any joy away from my mom on my wedding day. I would tell him if he can't show me and my mom respect on this day, he can stay away. \n\nThe cheater wants to bring the other cheater to his child's wedding, where they will make their own vows of fidelity. He just doesn't get it. No shame.", "NTA. Tell him he can stay home then.", "NTA- You need to tell him that his wedding is about you and you don\u2019t want here there. He is invited to attend as a guest, the invitation is not mandatory.", "NTA, its your wedding, you get to decide who you want to support you.\n\nYou Dad has an invite out of courtesy, and the fact he is still your Dad and you love him.\n\nHis \"partner\" is not part of your life, you have no relationship with her and you hold her equally responsible as him to the divorce.  The fact he has no relationship with the other guests is a result of his actions and he can sit back and enjoy the day and make polite conversation with the other guests, maybe he will make some new friends.\n\nI would tell him the above if he can't handle the truth of the situation, that's on him.", "NTA and tell your dad affair partners are not part of the family so he should consider himself lucky.", "NTA", "I\u2019m going to go against the crowd here and say YTA but only because I think your reasons are incorrect.\n\nOf course you don\u2019t have to invite someone you don\u2019t want at your wedding, but it sounds like your issue are with your father, not his partner and excluding her won\u2019t fix that.\n\nThat\u2019s not his \u2018new partner\u2019 that\u2019s someone he has been with for over 6 years (unless I misunderstood).\n\nYour mum had a right to have a problem with him since she was hurt by the affair, but a lot of time has passed since then and it sounds like she\u2019s moved on.\n\nTheir divorce should not have meant you were distanced from him, he wasn\u2019t divorcing you and you were an adult. Clearly though your relationship with him broke down and the issues you now have with your father might need to be addressed, but that\u2019s not his partners fault.\n\nAlso, in my opinion you are not both from \u2018broken families\u2019 just because your parents are no longer together. \n\nI really hope you manage to sort things out because it actually sounds like everyone involved is doing quite well and is happier now.", "Honestly, op was genuinely gracious enough to even invite him at all. \n\nIf it were me I\u2019d be like \u201cI don\u2019t want people who don\u2019t respect the sanctity of marriage at my wedding\u201d so sorry.", "Good he can not go.", "NTA and everyone is gonna be on your side because she\u2019s an \u201caffair partner\u201d but really, just the fact that you won\u2019t be comfortable, for whatever reason, is enough. I didn\u2019t want my dad\u2019s partner there for a different set of issues, and he still came (and paid for most of it). \n\nNow, he left right after the meal and didn\u2019t come to the brunch the next day, but he was able to toast me and respect my boundaries. He didn\u2019t have to mingle afterwards, but if he\u2019d drawn a line in the sand, I would respect it, but from a distance, because I don\u2019t think I could forgive him not choosing me again. I hope your dad comes to the same realization.", "Canada?", "Avec doesn\u2019t mean \u201cplus one\u201d it means \u201cwith\u201d.", "I agree.  He was the home wrecker.  But, she was complicit.  I doubt very seriously that she didn\u2019t know he was still married.  If she didn\u2019t know, she would have when it blew up.  I guess she was so love struck by then she couldn\u2019t help herself.  In her place, given the circumstances, it would take a lot of brass to even consider attending the wedding.  She should tell the Dad he must be out of his mind for even considering it.  He should be grateful he\u2019s invited.", "\u201cIf she didn\u2019t know, she would have when it blew up.\u201d\n\nOP has never even spoken to this woman. Maybe it never blew up. They don\u2019t know each other.\n\nMy dad married the woman he cheated on my mom with and she was absolutely clueless. They dated for four years. She didn\u2019t even know I or my brother existed. Eventually that did blow up, partly because I met her. Meeting the kid she didn\u2019t know existed obviously blew her mind and the rest of the info followed. She did divorce him. He went on to do this to at least 3 other women. Once he was even engaged to two women at the same time. Cheaters are liars, and it\u2019s amazing how they can lie!\n\nShe doesn\u2019t ever have to know or give a shit about this woman. I just wouldn\u2019t assume anything about her. That\u2019s all.", "Then she definitely shouldn\u2019t be offended about not being invited to the wedding.  Given the circumstances, why would she even expect to be invited?  But that\u2019s a question for OP\u2019s clueless father.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to invite the affair partner who broke up your family. Also, it would make your mom feel bad, and she\u2019s the parent you care about.\n\nBoo boo for poor old dad. He can live with the consequences of his actions.", "nta - tell your dad you don\u2019t want to jinx your wedding with his affair partner attending. He is an adult and if he truly wants to see you on your wedding day, he can attend alone.", "Be sure to remind him that maybe you don't want to see someone who didn't honor a married couple on your wedding day. HE is welcome not to come but she's not invited. Plus think how your mom would feel and people would talk about it\n\nNTA and congrats", "NTA but you may want to reconsider inviting your dad, especially if he continues to push for a +1 for his affair partner.", "NTA he should feel so lucky that you extended him an invite. That is incredibly magnanimous of you.", "op=NTA\n\nyour guest list is your guest list. \n\nPlus 1) you've MET all the other plus ones from the other three parents.  2) it is highly likely your mother would be uncomfortable with the affair partner attending(tho it's likely that being an awesome mother she would buck up for the wedding). 3) you don't want to invite her.", "I really love calling a plus one an \u201cavec\u201d and want to try to make this take off in the states. NTA", "Nta\n\nEnjoy your wedding. Let him miss it if he won't leave his partner home. His choice.", "NTA. However, I feel it\u2019s unfair of OP to place more blame on this neighbor than the father. Yeah, it\u2019s a dick move to date a married man, but it\u2019s a much bigger dick move to cheat on one\u2019s wife. This neighbor did not make vows, nor did she enter into a legal institution. Father did that. Consider that if you can forgive your father to a degree, perhaps you can forgive her too. Is it so damn hard to talk to one\u2019s spouse BEFORE you decide to violate wedding vows?\n\nStill, it\u2019s enough that you are uncomfortable and most certainly Mom might be, although, presumably if she\u2019s in a relationship she is past it. It\u2019s you and your betrothed\u2019s day, and while I think you\u2019re placing blame where it doesn\u2019t belong, you absolutely deserve to be comfortable, drama-free, and not worrying about how anyone else feels. \n\nIf Dad chooses not to come, you will know that you made the effort and that is enough. Whatever happens, I hope your wedding is beautiful and stress-free (as much as possible).", "ESH, if your mom's husband is invited it's only fair that your dad's partner is as well.", "Yeah, cause there\u2019s nothing less awkward than parading your affair partner around the wedding of your daughter! \u201cHey, everyone! Come meet the woman of my dreams, who single-handedly helped me blow up my marriage and family.\u201d That\u2019s way less awkward that just going solo!\n\nI agree. What was he thinking? And how entitled is he? OP, it\u2019s your wedding, and his feelings on the matter are irrelevant. He hurt you and your mother DEEPLY, and made the conscious decision to do so. The fact that he\u2019s still with the AP and is insisting on her presence at your wedding is peak entitlement and the epitome of self-absorbed. NTA, OP. Having the AP at your wedding will create an ungodly amount of drama and further hurt.", "If your dad can\u2019t understand this then that is his problem he can choose not to come if he insists to bring his side piece. Make it very clear that she is NOT INVITED and have someone at the door making sure dad doesn\u2019t bring her,looks to me you just invited him to be polite, plus he has no role in wedding so in reality he wouldn\u2019t be missed if decided not to show. Congrats!! And have fun!!!", "Obviously. You also don\u2019t step out on your own family", "I don\u2019t have any reason to think she\u2019s upset or even wants to go. I think dad wants to bring her so he\u2019s not alone there.", "Well then Dad is going to need to make a decision.  He knows how his child (rightly or wrongly) feels about his GF.  She doesn\u2019t want her there.  He will need to either accept it and attend alone or refuse to go\u2014which means any chance of a future relationship between him and his daughter probably goes out the window.  It\u2019s pity that parents who cheat either can\u2019t or won\u2019t consider the ramifications of their behavior on their future relationship with their children.  The delusion is strong I guess."]}
