One of them I went on 6 dates with and decided I didn\u2019t like too much and the other is my current bf. After my current bf and I agreed to be exclusive I told the other date (let\u2019s call him Mark) that I was going to be exclusive with someone else and wished him luck. He replied saying I should reconsider and that he would have asked me to be exclusive but he thought I wanted to take things slow. I said I had already considered and that my current bf is a better fit and he said I had left my sunglasses at his place. I said I would come and pick it up tomorrow after work and he said he was in the area and he would be over. He come over in 10 min which was really weird because he lives like 30 min away. \n\nHe knocked and I opened and took the glasses and thanked him. He asked to come inside and I said it wasn\u2019t a good idea and he said he would like to stay friends and I said I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea because of the context we had met. He said fine under his breath and left.\n\nA week later I spotted him at my neighbor hood grocery store. I thought again it was weird because he normally shops at a store near his place and said hi to him. He said he had just been in the area and asked if I wanted to chat and grab coffee. I said no I have to go to meet a friend and left.\n\nThen like 2 months later I saw him while I was taken out the trash. I was spooked really bad because it was at night and he was in the hallway. I asked what he was doing there and he said he was seeing a friend. I said cool and got into the elevator and he got in too and got off at my floor. I was really scared and ran into my unit. He knocked on my door and I told him to go away. He started ranting I was paranoid and he was just here to see a friend. I told him to go see that friend and looked in the peephole and he was still there. I called 911 because I was getting scared and thought he might be stalking me. He stayed at my door not saying anything for a few minutes and then left. The police came shortly after and took my statement and said they would look into reviewing the security cameras. The guy texted me a week later on another number saying he is sorry he scared me.  It made me feel guilty for calling the police because he  gave me the unit number to contact them and they will vouch for him.", "created_utc": 1668631929, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yx5uy6/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_my_ex/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He might have been trying to convince her of the truth out of fear that she could ruin his life by accusing him of stalking. I don't think this is the case here, because his other actions seem a bit suspicious, but just wanted to put another possibility out there. \n\nWomen have a lot to fear from men, because some men are predators, so she isn't the asshole either way. That said, false accusations of sexual assault and stalking happen more often than people like to admit, and lots of men have a reasonable fear of misunderstandings like this blowing up and ruining their lives. \n\nEither way, I think he probably was the asshole here, but when there's even a chance there's just a misunderstanding, I try to see other possibilities and mention them so people can see other points of view.", "idk coincidences don\u2019t chase you when you run away from them, repeatedly knock on your door, and then proceed to stand outside your apartment for an extended amount of time after you\u2019ve repeatedly told them to go away (as if the running away wasn\u2019t enough of a clue\u2026)", "Misunderstanding I get.
