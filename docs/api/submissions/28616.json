Since you would otherwise have saved this up in your fun money account I see no issue, it's not a detriment to your financial future.  You're fine here.", "NTA - you've explained in other replies that it came out of your fun money, and that other than mortgage car payments you have no outstanding debt, kids are well looked after, etc. Spending money on Lego is no more abnormal than spending a ridiculous amount on a set of golf clubs along with a membership to the local golf course - and it;s probably cheaper. Hobbies come in all shapes and forms, and there's nothing wrong with Legos. Show her the age limit on the box  the one that says 4 to 99.\n\nSide note - this is at least the third post about Legos I've seen in the last 2 days.", "Info- what does she spend money on that you don\u2019t say anything about?", "Nearly 2k in one go when you have debts to pay off? YTA. \nLego is a legitimate hobby, and you have every right to save up your personal money to spend on it. What you don't have is the right to spend a big chunk of money on a personal hobby if that money is not from your own personal savings. \nAlso, pay off your debts before any big spends. \nI recommend negotiating with your wife an amount of money each month that is specifically \"yours\" and \"hers\". That money can be spent on whatever you like, without guilt, with household money ring fenced for household and jointly agreed expenditure.", "YTA, you knew she wouldn't be ok with you spending $2,000 on Legos, but you did it anyway. You said you chose to do it and ask for forgiveness later. You aren't sorry. You are basically telling her the money is gone, it's not coming back, now watch as I play with $2,000 worth of Legos, and accept this fake apology I had already planned to give you while I was putting these sets in my cart.", "NTA. Each of you should budget in hobbie, that\u2019s what life is all about, living! As long as it\u2019s within your means of course, and the amount is fair for both of you. I can\u2019t tell from your post the level of your normal \u201cfun budget\u201d", "I mean 2k on something is a HUGE amount like that\u2019s more than I earn in a month and realistically you should be speaking with your wife when dropping so much money on something. Just because it\u2019s a hobby doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any different on her going out and dropping 2K on a designer handbag. You\u2019re in debt you say so I don\u2019t think spending that much on Lego at once is a good idea. You deserve to be able to spend some money on your hobbies, but 2k all at once is too much if you have debt and you should have sat down with your wife and discussed it and come to a solution where you can still enjoy your hobby, but compromising on the price.", "NTA. If you have a fun money account and she does then spend it how you want. As long as the essentials are paid for then go for it.", "YTA for not discussing this with your wife. Anything that expensive needs to be gone over, so that she's at least aware of the expense and can budget her own spending if needed to balance it. You don't necessarily need to ask permission, but at least saying 'Hey, honey, there's a new Lego set I want, and if I get it and one other, it's going to be X' is basic courtesy to the person you're living with.", "2k does seem a lot, but since u say you earn the majority, i dont think it matters much and as u say u dont spend as often as she does.\n\nConclusion? NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been putting much of your fun money into an investment account\n\nYou are making double mortgage payments every month.\n\nYou really have very little debt compared to the average American.\n\nHowever it is a large sum of money and it should\u2019ve been talked about with her. Even if she recently bought herself a 2K handbag and didn\u2019t check with you.\n\nIf this money came out of your fun budget and not the household budget, then enjoy your bricks.", "NTA. I spend that much on video games every 3 months and it is the only hobby I spend money on. My wife doesn\u2019t care however, but if she did I\u2019d still do it.", "Nta", "NTA, everyone should have a hobby they enjoy. Even taking into account you charged it, if you have the means to pay it back in a timely manner what exactly is the problem? \n\nYou are the main breadwinner, she really should not question your spending if it is done responsibly. Your income is what is holding up your family, and in one of your replies you state she gets to keep whatever she earns in addition to what you give her? \n\nPlus you invest what you do not spend for her future also. Yeah NTA. Your wife is a slight asshole for trying to question how you spend your money, but I get it. Her future relies heavily on you, so it makes sense to want to make sure everything is accounted for.", "I'm curious as to why you mention you are the main breadwinner? Does it change your budget depending on who is earning? Do you think you deserve more money as you wife is working less whilst raising your kids? Do you maybe subconsciously have less respect for her role in the family? Y T A for such a big spend seemingly out of the blue. As mentioned you have equal \"fun money\" as your wife then you can save it and spend it on what ever you like. So just keep a record of it when you invest it so that you can make large purchases should you so desire. If you did do this N T A, Then there's no reason she should have issues. Totally with you there's nothing wrong with lego, so maybe her ire is from another source and it was just triggered by the large spend. Is she involved in your money management? If not maybe involve her more so she can see you are just spending your play money not draining the household budget for toys (awesome toys but ya know) she may have just been confused where the money came from.  Unless you are actually spending more than your allotted play cash, this seems more a communication and respect issue, ESH.", "YTA - you each get your own fun money. You used yours. Whether it\u2019s for investing or buying cheap shit - it was spent. And so you went over budget.\n\nYes I would be angry.", "YTA, if you are carrying debt you don't have money for Lego. You should have discussed a major purchase with your wife, especially if you knew she'd say no.\n\nNTA, if the debt is a mortgage.", "NTA. Some people spend their 'fun' money on games, some on wine, some on golfing weekends, some on handbags or shoes, some on lengthy hairdresser appointments or nail polishing, some on concert tickets or streaming services, and some on lego sets.  You don't spend your 'fun' money every month and it has accumulated - its not different if you purchased a set every month for the last 6 months, or buy them all in one day.  They are the same thing - if you have an agreement that you each have fun money, then I don't see why it is a problem if you just save yours up for one larger purchase.  Life is too short to live to pay bills - we all need something that just makes us happy, and if you can do that, then you are lucky.", "Probably NTA but why are you so into legos?

At least give a warning about spending so much, even if you're going to disagree and buy it anyway. Sometimes it helps to get another view on such purchases.", "NTA and honestly it's such a petty little move when people get together with someone they know has hobbies and then once the deal is sealed think they can unilaterally remove the hobby. A couple with 750 per month each in fun money can afford legos, OP's wife's issue is that she disapproves of them on some kind of aesthetic level. Well, too bad, sweet cheeks, you married a guy who likes legos. Honestly I think OP is very mature to be investing the fun money, in his position I would be buying exactly seven hundred and fifty dollars of legos per month and setting them up in the windows.", "Do you put aside fun money for each of you? if not you should and what you spend your fun money on is up to you.\nIf you have joint account, you should each have a separate on for the fun money.\nMy husband spends a lot on lego, that what he spends his fun money on.

If not, perhaps you could try to help her find one - we all need something to help us unwind.", "YTA, doesn't matter who earns more when kids are in the mix, half of it was her money. \n\nYou should have discussed pros and cons of saving it, buying lego and paying off the car.", "NTA. You're entitled to have hobbies and do fun things. So is she. I think each person deserves to have their own hobbies and interests.

I rarely spend my fun money, most of it gets tossed into an investment account, since I see little value in just letting it sit as cash. \n\nThat is a deal I could not pass up, and the only reason I got the deal was because I was also buying the new set.

I'm going to just go ahead and say YTA since you didn't consult your wife, and your only defenses seem to be \"it was a good deal I couldn't pass up\" and saying that you rarely spend your fun money despite admitting that you are technically choosing to spend it on investments.\n\nIt's kind of disrespecting the whole idea of having these budgets if you're allowed to invest all your fun budget and still buy whatever you want - the point of keeping your fun budget and not investing it is specifically for situations like this when legos you want go on sale.\n\nI think that going forward, you should stop investing all your fun budget money if you're going to want to buy legos or other hobby stuff.
