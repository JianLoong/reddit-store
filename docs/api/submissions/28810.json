The values \u200b\u200brefer to my country's money.  \nI (31M) dated Kate (29F) for a few years and she got pregnant with Ava (6F). Kate has Ava's custody and I have her every other weekend and some holidays, but because Kate really likes my parents and we're \"fine\" now, Ava used to spend afternoons with me after school and I could see her whenever I wanted.So, I met my fiancee Aly (32F) about 2 ya. Aly was a single mom to May (8F) and Lia (7F).  Ava met the girls and they seemed to get along well when they saw each other.  I proposed to Aly and we have been living together for a few months and that's when the problems started. Now, Ava has to share a room and since then has been throwing tantrums, refusing to sleep in room, fighting with her sisters, crying all the time.  The girls' school is also causing confusion. May and Lia studied at public school and now I pay for a private school for them (3k per month for each). Kate comes from an extremely wealthy family, and although I'm very well off, I don't have as much money as she does.She always wanted to put Ava in the same school she and her family attended when she was old enough and this year she puts Ava in this school (10k per month) and Ava keeps telling her sisters how great her school is and this makes May and Lia sad. Aly asked me to take Ava out of school and put her with the other 2 or send all 3 to the same school.  I told her I didn't have the money to pay for all 3 (I make 23k a month) and that Kate paid Ava's tuition.  Aly was very upset and called me AH for favoring one kid over the others and that it wasn't fair for Ava to go to such a fancy school and her sisters go to a bad school. Well, a few days ago Kate threw Ava a slumberparty and invited several of Ava's friends, without May and Lia.  I discovered it on Instagram, Aly was furious.  I talked to Kate about it and she said Ava didn't want the girls there and wouldn't make her do anything, so she hung up saying that Lia and May weren't her problem. Friday, when I got home, I found Ava hysterical because Aly had told her that she was leaving school and that she had to invite her sisters to parties or she wouldn't be able to have them over.  I calmed Ava down and took her to her mom's house and had a big fight with Aly. Saturday Kate came to my house and said she would file a lawsuit to stop Ava from having contact with Aly, that I couldn't go around playing house with someone else and hurt Ava and that Ava wouldn't pay for it, that Ava doesn't have sisters, that Aly should accept that Ava will always have better things because she can afford it and we cannot...There was more arguing and Kate go away saying I was an AH.My parents found out about the fight and are saying I'm an AH for treating random kids like mines and ruining my relationship with Ava and refusing to treat the girls like their granddaughters.  Ava is avoiding talking to me and crying because I replaced her with May and Lia.  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697158021, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176mbyz/aita_for_treating_my_daughter_and_stepdaughters/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to tell Aly to stay in her lane.  She doesn't get to make decisions about Ava's education or any activities that take place during Ava's mother's custody time.  Stop trying to force a familial relationship between Ava and your future stepdaughters....it won't end well for you.", "Hell yes YTA! These girls are not your stepdaughters because you are not married. Your fianc\u00e9e is jealous of your daughter and treating her horribly. She is not her mother & she does not get to control what your daughter does, who your daughter invites to a party, or what school your daughter attends. This is not going to work. She sounds controlling and emotionally abusive towards your daughter. What\u2019s next? Your daughter will have to give up her college fund because your fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t save for her own kids?  You need to step back from this relationship & put your daughter first. Do better!!", "Im not gonna say that you are an AH as I can understand that you wanted to be \u00ab\u00a0fair\u00a0\u00bb BUT here is the thing.\n\n1/ To me your priority should be Ava. Why ? Because it\u2019s your child and I believe that she sees you as her dad as well. Not sure that it is the same case for May and Lia.\n\n2/ sometimes parents are being a bit selfish when it comes to children\u2026 let me explain, if you can\u2019t offer the best for your first child, why would you put yourself in a situation when now you have to deal with more children. You said you could not pay for Ava school (10k) but you can pay for the school of children that it is not even yours ? (6k in total). Even if your ex girlfriend makes more money than you, you should try to participate as much as possible (5k, because you can clearly afford it) for Ava.\n\n3/ When you are a parent you are supposed to wish the best for your child. Kate wanted her child to get to a good school and that\u2019s what happened. And now your fiancee is jealous and clearly said to you \u00ab\u00a0I want YOUR child to go to a BAD school with my children\u00a0\u00bb. Are you going to accept that ? Are you going to compromise your future child so that your fiancee could be happy ? What you are asking us is \u00ab\u00a0Is that normal that my daughters MOTHER won\u2019t let me put OUR child in a BAD school so I could keep dating my fiancee\u00a0?\u00a0\u00bb.\n\n4/ You and your ex girlfriend broke off even if you had a child together. So you must know that a relationship is not as solid as what we wish. If you and your fiancee broke off for any reason then I guarantee you that she won\u2019t let uou ser HER children. Or maybe yes because apparently she needs you to pay her daughters school. \n\n5/ If you continue to act like a bad father by pushing this relation between your fiancee, her children and your daughter you will loose EVERYTHING that truly matters. \nYour Daughter, the mother of your daughter (which will be quite unfortunate because as you said you are in a good relationship with her and it\u2019s quite rare) but also your parents. \n\nMen really have to stop thinking with their dick. You like your fiancee BUT she does not like your child because she is willing to IMPACT NEGATIVELY YOUR child future to make her happy and feel less bad about her financial situation. \n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the truth.\n\nAnd let me add something. The more you spend your time thinking about a situation which is very clear the more you show to your parents, ex girlfriend and daughter that you don\u2019t really value your role as a dad and that you are immature. You should not need to post on Reddit about it. It\u2019s a super red flag. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 From the BEGINNING you should have said \u00ab\u00a0I will put my child future above everything, but I will still respect you and your children.\u00a0\u00bb \n\nGood luck for not destroying your family in the future ! Be careful of who enter in your life and have interactions with your child and family. \n\n(Sorry English is not my native language)", "YTA\n\nYour first responsibility is to Ava.\n\nIt's past time to show Aly and her daughters to the door.

Making her now share a room isn't going to help either, as she gets older she's going to spend more time with her mom if you do that when she had her own before.  Everything you're doing is pushing her away.\n\nLike it or not, your fianc\u00e9e doesn't get a say is much of your daughters life, not when her mother is involved and providing funds.  She's going to have to learn to live with that, and that harsh as it is, your daughter will have more opportunities in life due to that than her kids.  This isn't anything you can change, and it's not your fault, or responsibility.  It's great you care and are making an effort, but know what your limits are.", "This is a mess.

You have no right to force Ava to go to a lesser school to appease your fiancee (because Ava's MOM is paying for her particular schooling), nor to invite your fiancee's children to a sleepover at Kate's (Ava's mother) house with Ava's friends. Ava doesn't think of May and Lia as her friends, and you can't force that kind of relationship. Aly is showing some major red flags and so are you as a father. You and Aly aren't even married yet and you're already letting your daughter get the short end of the stick. If things don't work out with Aly, you have Ava who will always remember how you treated her and it will affect your relationship with her forever.

Stop trying to force relationships that don\u2019t exist.  \n\nSecond. Give your daughter back her own room. Girlfriend\u2019s daughter should be sharing a room.\n\nThird. Tell your girlfriend to stay in her lane and that since the girls have different parents then different schools, parties and friends are real and unmovable things. \n\nFourth. Your girlfriend sounds jealous of your daughter. \n\nFifth. Why In the hell are your paying tuition for your girlfriend\u2019s daughter.  They have their own parents for that.  Girlfriend is approaching gold digger territory since you are now spending a huge part of your salary supporting them.  Again, they have parents and you are not their parent.  \n\nYour are the AH for putting girlfriend\u2019s daughters before own. You daughter has every right to feel replaced.  You are going to irreparably damage your relationship with your own child.", "YTA. Ava is not Aly's daughter, Aly needs to butt out.

It won't end well for anyone.", "YTA, smooth.  \n\nMaybe you're doing what you think is right for your stepdaughters, but the way it's being done is hurting Ava. \n\nAly, however, is completely out of her mind.  She can't say where Ava goes to school and what she does at her mom's house if she isn't paying for it.  It sounds like Aly is jealous of Ava... \n\nDoes Aly work?  What is her contribution to May and Lia's expenses?  Do you pay Ava's child support?  \nDude, you guys aren't even married yet and she treats her daughter this way... \n\nLots of red flags.  I feel sorry for the kids stuck in this mess, especially May and Lia, as Kate seems to protect Ava.", "YTA, massively so.", "YTA for sure and the moment that woman suggested yanking your kid out of her school is the moment she should have been out of your life for good.", "YTA dude, you\u2019re gonna lose everything", "Yes so wth is wrong with you that you would seriously let your new woman make major decisions about your child to her detriment, obviously purely because she's jealous.
