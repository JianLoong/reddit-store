The values \u200b\u200brefer to my country's money.  \nI (31M) dated Kate (29F) for a few years and she got pregnant with Ava (6F). Kate has Ava's custody and I have her every other weekend and some holidays, but because Kate really likes my parents and we're \"fine\" now, Ava used to spend afternoons with me after school and I could see her whenever I wanted.So, I met my fiancee Aly (32F) about 2 ya. Aly was a single mom to May (8F) and Lia (7F).  Ava met the girls and they seemed to get along well when they saw each other.  I proposed to Aly and we have been living together for a few months and that's when the problems started. Now, Ava has to share a room and since then has been throwing tantrums, refusing to sleep in room, fighting with her sisters, crying all the time.  The girls' school is also causing confusion. May and Lia studied at public school and now I pay for a private school for them (3k per month for each). Kate comes from an extremely wealthy family, and although I'm very well off, I don't have as much money as she does.She always wanted to put Ava in the same school she and her family attended when she was old enough and this year she puts Ava in this school (10k per month) and Ava keeps telling her sisters how great her school is and this makes May and Lia sad. Aly asked me to take Ava out of school and put her with the other 2 or send all 3 to the same school.  I told her I didn't have the money to pay for all 3 (I make 23k a month) and that Kate paid Ava's tuition.  Aly was very upset and called me AH for favoring one kid over the others and that it wasn't fair for Ava to go to such a fancy school and her sisters go to a bad school. Well, a few days ago Kate threw Ava a slumberparty and invited several of Ava's friends, without May and Lia.  I discovered it on Instagram, Aly was furious.  I talked to Kate about it and she said Ava didn't want the girls there and wouldn't make her do anything, so she hung up saying that Lia and May weren't her problem. Friday, when I got home, I found Ava hysterical because Aly had told her that she was leaving school and that she had to invite her sisters to parties or she wouldn't be able to have them over.  I calmed Ava down and took her to her mom's house and had a big fight with Aly. Saturday Kate came to my house and said she would file a lawsuit to stop Ava from having contact with Aly, that I couldn't go around playing house with someone else and hurt Ava and that Ava wouldn't pay for it, that Ava doesn't have sisters, that Aly should accept that Ava will always have better things because she can afford it and we cannot...There was more arguing and Kate go away saying I was an AH.My parents found out about the fight and are saying I'm an AH for treating random kids like mines and ruining my relationship with Ava and refusing to treat the girls like their granddaughters.  Ava is avoiding talking to me and crying because I replaced her with May and Lia.  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697158021, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176mbyz/aita_for_treating_my_daughter_and_stepdaughters/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to tell Aly to stay in her lane.  She doesn't get to make decisions about Ava's education or any activities that take place during Ava's mother's custody time.  Stop trying to force a familial relationship between Ava and your future stepdaughters....it won't end well for you.", "Hell yes YTA! These girls are not your stepdaughters because you are not married. Your fianc\u00e9e is jealous of your daughter and treating her horribly. She is not her mother & she does not get to control what your daughter does, who your daughter invites to a party, or what school your daughter attends. This is not going to work. She sounds controlling and emotionally abusive towards your daughter. What\u2019s next? Your daughter will have to give up her college fund because your fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t save for her own kids?  You need to step back from this relationship & put your daughter first. Do better!!", "Im not gonna say that you are an AH as I can understand that you wanted to be \u00ab\u00a0fair\u00a0\u00bb BUT here is the thing.\n\n1/ To me your priority should be Ava. Why ? Because it\u2019s your child and I believe that she sees you as her dad as well. Not sure that it is the same case for May and Lia.\n\n2/ sometimes parents are being a bit selfish when it comes to children\u2026 let me explain, if you can\u2019t offer the best for your first child, why would you put yourself in a situation when now you have to deal with more children. You said you could not pay for Ava school (10k) but you can pay for the school of children that it is not even yours ? (6k in total). Even if your ex girlfriend makes more money than you, you should try to participate as much as possible (5k, because you can clearly afford it) for Ava.\n\n3/ When you are a parent you are supposed to wish the best for your child. Kate wanted her child to get to a good school and that\u2019s what happened. And now your fiancee is jealous and clearly said to you \u00ab\u00a0I want YOUR child to go to a BAD school with my children\u00a0\u00bb. Are you going to accept that ? Are you going to compromise your future child so that your fiancee could be happy ? What you are asking us is \u00ab\u00a0Is that normal that my daughters MOTHER won\u2019t let me put OUR child in a BAD school so I could keep dating my fiancee\u00a0?\u00a0\u00bb.\n\n4/ You and your ex girlfriend broke off even if you had a child together. So you must know that a relationship is not as solid as what we wish. If you and your fiancee broke off for any reason then I guarantee you that she won\u2019t let uou ser HER children. Or maybe yes because apparently she needs you to pay her daughters school. \n\n5/ If you continue to act like a bad father by pushing this relation between your fiancee, her children and your daughter you will loose EVERYTHING that truly matters. \nYour Daughter, the mother of your daughter (which will be quite unfortunate because as you said you are in a good relationship with her and it\u2019s quite rare) but also your parents. \n\nMen really have to stop thinking with their dick. You like your fiancee BUT she does not like your child because she is willing to IMPACT NEGATIVELY YOUR child future to make her happy and feel less bad about her financial situation. \n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the truth.\n\nAnd let me add something. The more you spend your time thinking about a situation which is very clear the more you show to your parents, ex girlfriend and daughter that you don\u2019t really value your role as a dad and that you are immature. You should not need to post on Reddit about it. It\u2019s a super red flag. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 From the BEGINNING you should have said \u00ab\u00a0I will put my child future above everything, but I will still respect you and your children.\u00a0\u00bb \n\nGood luck for not destroying your family in the future ! Be careful of who enter in your life and have interactions with your child and family. \n\n(Sorry English is not my native language)", "YTA\n\nYour first responsibility is to Ava.\n\nIt's past time to show Aly and her daughters to the door.

Making her now share a room isn't going to help either, as she gets older she's going to spend more time with her mom if you do that when she had her own before.  Everything you're doing is pushing her away.\n\nLike it or not, your fianc\u00e9e doesn't get a say is much of your daughters life, not when her mother is involved and providing funds.  She's going to have to learn to live with that, and that harsh as it is, your daughter will have more opportunities in life due to that than her kids.  This isn't anything you can change, and it's not your fault, or responsibility.  It's great you care and are making an effort, but know what your limits are.", "This is a mess.

You have no right to force Ava to go to a lesser school to appease your fiancee (because Ava's MOM is paying for her particular schooling), nor to invite your fiancee's children to a sleepover at Kate's (Ava's mother) house with Ava's friends. Ava doesn't think of May and Lia as her friends, and you can't force that kind of relationship. Aly is showing some major red flags and so are you as a father. You and Aly aren't even married yet and you're already letting your daughter get the short end of the stick. If things don't work out with Aly, you have Ava who will always remember how you treated her and it will affect your relationship with her forever.

Stop trying to force relationships that don\u2019t exist.  \n\nSecond. Give your daughter back her own room. Girlfriend\u2019s daughter should be sharing a room.\n\nThird. Tell your girlfriend to stay in her lane and that since the girls have different parents then different schools, parties and friends are real and unmovable things. \n\nFourth. Your girlfriend sounds jealous of your daughter. \n\nFifth. Why In the hell are your paying tuition for your girlfriend\u2019s daughter.  They have their own parents for that.  Girlfriend is approaching gold digger territory since you are now spending a huge part of your salary supporting them.  Again, they have parents and you are not their parent.  \n\nYour are the AH for putting girlfriend\u2019s daughters before own. You daughter has every right to feel replaced.  You are going to irreparably damage your relationship with your own child.", "YTA. Ava is not Aly's daughter, Aly needs to butt out.

It won't end well for anyone.", "YTA, smooth.  \n\nMaybe you're doing what you think is right for your stepdaughters, but the way it's being done is hurting Ava. \n\nAly, however, is completely out of her mind.  She can't say where Ava goes to school and what she does at her mom's house if she isn't paying for it.  It sounds like Aly is jealous of Ava... \n\nDoes Aly work?  What is her contribution to May and Lia's expenses?  Do you pay Ava's child support?  \nDude, you guys aren't even married yet and she treats her daughter this way... \n\nLots of red flags.  I feel sorry for the kids stuck in this mess, especially May and Lia, as Kate seems to protect Ava.", "YTA, massively so.", "YTA for sure and the moment that woman suggested yanking your kid out of her school is the moment she should have been out of your life for good.", "YTA dude, you\u2019re gonna lose everything", "Yes so wth is wrong with you that you would seriously let your new woman make major decisions about your child to her detriment, obviously purely because she's jealous.

Your daughter is going through a really tough time and doesn\u2019t get along with your gf\u2019s kids, but she\u2019s in big trouble for not inviting them to her bday? Well she doesn\u2019t have to, she deserves to have her friends there and exactly who she feels comfortable with. I would seriously look at your priorities, your new relationship, and decide if you are making the right decision by staying w your new gf.", "YTA. Aly needs to back way off. She does not make decisions for Ava. Period. Ava does not want to be around Aly\u2019s kids - this is also perfectly fine.

You are fool, who is forgetting his daughter should come first and not everything is or can be equal.  \n\nYour fiancee is not Kate.  She can not afford private school for her kids.

Dude your fianc\u00e9e is upset at the idea that you might favor your own child over hers. Witch you absolutely should be doing and she should support. \nPlease stop telling your child that these kids, who are not related to her by blood adoption or marriage, are her sisters. It's untrue and hurtful, and lying to a child about their family is wrong.\nand you asked your patents to help you emotionally abuse your 6 year old? and your shocked they refused? lol", "YTA.\n\nThey aren't her sisters. They aren't even her step sisters at this point. Just dad's gfs kids who have come in and taken over her time with you. They have to develop a relationship, which may or may not come in time. Just because you want Aly & her kids doesn't mean Ava does. She has no choice here but is the one being targeted and dealing with the repercussions of your choices.\n\nAly has ZERO say in where Ava is educated. None. You aren't paying for it. She isn't paying for it. Kate is. Why should Kate deny her child an opportunity cos you and Aly can't provide the same for her children? Why are *you* happy to deny Ava that opportunity? Fair isn't always equal. \n\nAlso, what Kate does and plans with or for Ava during her custody time is none of yours or Alys business. Ava did not want the girls there. That should tell you something about their (nonexistent) relationship. If Aly & the girls extend invitations to Ava, good for them. It doesn't mean Ava & Kate have to do the same.\n\nSo far, you're fine with Aly demanding and dictating the shots over Ava. You're fine with her telling her she can't come and visit her home... and you're ok with all that? You are treating the girls equally. You aren't the one providing all the extra things Ava has, KATE is.

Your wife is being ridiculous and is being unfair to Ava. Your wife is just going to have to deal with the fact that Ava will have and do things from her mum that her children may not. That is the reality of coparenting. Ava doesn\u2019t live with you full time so it doesn\u2019t matter whether they go to the same school or not. It\u2019s not like you are paying for it.   The fact that your wife wants to put her in a different school just to make herself feel better is unbelievably selfish. If your wife can\u2019t deal with the situation then she shouldn\u2019t have married someone that already had a child. You are being unfair to Ava by listening to her nonsense. Stop entertaining it and put Ava first.", "YTA", "YTA for considering your girlfriend's daughter sisters to your daughter and for even considering taking your daughter out of her school. Hopefully you have no say in the matter. Your ex is right in her views of the matters presented here. You should take your lead from her, since your moral compass seems to have stopped working. The problem here is not about you treating your stepdaughters the same as your own daughter. The problem is you are not seeing your correct place in the world!", "YTA. Quit thinking with your dick.\n\nYour girlfriend is a gold digger. She saw you coming a mile away.

Aly is over stepping in your daughters business.", "You\u2019re well on the way to alienating your daughter. \n\nAly needs to mind her own business. Her kids are not Ava\u2019s siblings and it\u2019s about time you both realised it. \n\nIf Ava wants to have a party or anything else without the spoilt brats, then she can. \n\nKate sounds as tho she has a lot more money than you to fight for full custody, so be very careful. Otherwise you\u2019ll find Alys has her wish and only her kids have you as a dad. She\u2019s a bitter jealous woman, be careful \n\nYTA", "YTA. To me, you failed to handle this situation as a father. It started with introducing an irrational person such as Aly in her life.\n\nAly has to understand that Kate's money is not hers. Kate has a say on Ava's education as a mother and she's even paying for it. If Aly want better education for her children, it should be her responsibility. I don't think you formally adopted your stepdaughters and you're not married to Aly yet. Do you think she will stop at that? She will continuously compare the life of Ava from the life of her daughters. And if not handled well, it will affect your relationship with your real daughter.", "Yta. Your girlfriend abuses your daughter, and you do nothing.", "YTA for not managing this situation better. When Ava was having a hard time adjusting to the new family structure, that was the time to reassess and figure out if you needed to live apart for longer until everyone could come to a common understanding. I think being asked to share a room with one of the girls was too much \u2014 don\u2019t move in with your partner until you can afford that they each have their own room. \n\nBeyond that, you should have talked with Aly about joining families and made sure that she was on the same page. If her kids go to public school and yours goes to an expensive private school, she\u2019s got no say unless she wants to pay herself to send her kids to private school. And it\u2019s highly inappropriate that she\u2019s making any kind of demands of your daughter \u2014 she should never make parenting decisions for your daughter and also that\u2019s inappropriate to force them to be together. \n\nYour daughter is right to feel upset about the situation. You fucked up big time by not putting her first. At this point, I think your best option is to separate living from your fianc\u00e9e. You can keep an apartment and live with your daughter when she\u2019s with you and with your fianc\u00e9e when she\u2019s not. But ultimately, your fianc\u00e9e needs counseling so she understands appropriate step parent boundaries and if she\u2019s not on board with that, you should not marry.", "Shame of a father, and you won\u2019t even reply here shitdad. Seems like your dick is more important than your kid", "YTA\n\nLet's be very clear. Those two girls are not her sisters. They're not even your daughters yet, unless you adopt them. Marrying their mother makes you a stepfather. Eve. After marriage, your fianc\u00e9e has no legal right to make any decisions regarding your daughter. None whatsoever. And you have made massive errors in the way you are handling this.\n\nYou have chosen a woman who is interfering with your family in a horrendous way. She is determined to tear your daughter down to her level in the hopes of bullying you into raising her children up. That is *despicable*. She is bullying a 6yo, intentionally confusing and upsetting her, as a manipulation tactic.\n\nIf that's the woman you love, that is extremely concerning about your character. Your daughter should always come first. The fact that your fianc\u00e9e is clearly getting a lot of financial benefit from you, which is tangentially affecting the quality of your daughters life, is a big red flag. If you stay with her when she is behaving like this, you have picked a side.\n\nIf she tries to fix her behaviour, maybe you can  salvage things. But people that cruel and entitled are incapable of change in my experience. Your ex is right to do everything she can to protect her daughter from the Lady Tremaine you've chosen to subject her to. This has gone too far and you'll never go back to the way it was. Whether or not you have a decent relationship with your daughter going forward depends on what you do now.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nYou may have stepdaughters, but your daughter absolutely **does not** have sisters.\n\nYou think you can just force Ava into the life you want without respecting her feelings or what she wants, and it doesn't work like that.\n\nNot only is your daughter not interested in or compatible with your fianc\u00e9e's children, but now she's being punished for how she lives her life away from them.\n\nYou will absolutely alienate your child and lose access to her if you keep foisting your toxic and punitive fianc\u00e9e on her.

She said something like \u00ab\u00a0her sisters go to a bad school\u00a0\u00bb. But even if a private school was a bad school it\u2019s not the important thing here to me. When you see how things are going on even if they were all going to a fancy school Aly will still be mad about something. And that\u2019s what is happening because now she wants Ava to include her sisters at her parties even if Ava is not close with them. What will be next ? Kate will go to fancy vacations and they will be forced to include the whole \u00ab\u00a0family\u00a0\u00bb.
