Her parents are flying in tomorrow night and are staying with us until Saturday.  Her sister and her family live a couple hours away so they are coming just for the day on Thursday.  One family member that I specifically asked about was her younger brother, Mike.  \n\nMike has struggled with substance abuse and gambling for as long as I've been with my wife.  Shortly after my wife and I got married, he conned my wife out of about $5K.  She pulled the money from our shared account without talking to me about it.  The money was supposed to be for a down payment on a house that Mike was going to renovate and flip.  He \"promised\" my wife that he would give her more than double back after he sold the house.  \n\nWell, he didn't even buy the house.  He used the money to pay off some gambling debts, go on a bender, and gambled the rest away.  Cherry on top was that we had to pay to bail him out of jail after he got caught breaking into a hardware store near the end of his bender.  After that, I told my wife I was done with her brother and want nothing to do with him.  She tried to talk me out of it by saying \"he's still family\" and all that BS that enablers like to say.  \n\nHe showed up at our house about 6-months after that but I was the only one home.  He said he wanted to talk to his sister but I told him to leave before I call the cops.  He tried to apologize, but I told him that unless he has $5K to put in my hand, I don't want to hear a word he has to say.  I told my wife what happened and she called me out for being a jerk to her brother when he was trying to apologize.  I just don't trust him.\n\nWhen we were planning Thanksgiving, I was told by my wife that Mike is not attending.  I specifically asked and she said he isn't coming.  But, last night my MIL called for a final chat before they fly out to make sure they didn't need to bring anything else.  My wife had her on speaker and MIL asked if my wife had heard from Mike.  My wife quickly took her off speaker and left the room.\n\nWhen she came back, she immediately started trying to explain.  She said that Mike had apologized to everyone in the family and has been totally clean for almost a year.  She said he's started his own business and is doing really well.  She said that she invited him to Thanksgiving because it's supposed to be about family and coming together.  She said that everyone in the family has forgiven him, and she needs me to forgive him too.\n\nI told her that if Mike shows up, I will leave.  I told her that I have forgiven her for giving him that money without talking to me about it, but I haven't forgiven him and I don't want to see him.  She asked me to do it for her because it's important to her and I told her that this is a hard boundary for me and if he comes, I go.  \n\nShe said I'm putting her in an impossible position to choose between her brother and her husband and I need to forgive him like everyone else has.", "created_utc": 1669147490, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z23fj3/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_wont_help_and_i_will/", "score": 1857, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't trust her not to take more money from your shared account to give to her brother during Thanksgiving.

One day while talking to me he told me, he never trusted my uncle even before this incident asy uncle had asked my dad for money on occasions and dad had helped him out and never saw that money back and to never trust him if he asks me for money. Well my mom was really sorry because she thought her brother had finally mended his ways and it was a chance he needed and she thought she will get back the money by the time my sister went off to college.

Now she and dad have separate accounts and as she has always been a SAHM, my dad gives her monthly fun money (and my sister and I contribute to that) so that she has more than enough for herself. My dad was going to take a personal loan for my sister and I was going for my masters, I gave my half of fund to my sister and took a loan for myself.

He made absolutely sure of that when he lied to you about what he was going to do with the loan.  \n\nIf he wants to make this right, he can start by returning the 5000 plus interest.  If in fact his business has been doing so well, that should not be a hardship for him.

I can relate to this on so many levels and I can see and understand everyone's point of view. I was an addict and I have been sober since 2012. I have also been on the other side of this, in your wife's position, because my son ended up getting addicted as well (he is now going on 3 years sober). I feel you have every right to take your time to forgive, and others need to understand that the time just may never come. And that needs to be ok.  Unfortunately, when you're living the life of an addict, you burn many bridges that cant be re-built.  A year being sober is great, however, he is not out of the woods yet.  One of the first things I did when I got sober was to try to mend relationships that I destroyed.  Some never recovered because the betrayal was too much, and I have no choice but to accept that.  If I had taken $5k from family/friends I would have made it a point to pay it back, even if it broke me.  When I found out my son had a problem, I was making excuses for him and excusing his behavior due to the fact that I knew it wasn't really my son, it was the drugs and addiction that was changing him.  But in reality, I was enabling him.  I put him in rehab three times and attended the support meetings.  I learned how my behavior was not helping him and that he needed to hit rock bottom.  I can relate to how your wife wants to forgive and forget, however, you are right to have apprehensions.  You do not need to accept the apology, it is just sad that the family can't respect your feelings on this.", "NTA- I wouldn\u2019t trust him either. If he really wanted to make amends, he\u2019d start paying for the debt he owes you. An apology is empty without it. Your wife needs to respect your boundaries.

She has a habit of going behind your back when she knows she won't get her way.  Asking for forgiveness instead of permission is a coward or manipulators' way of doing things.  I don't blame you for your stance on your bil, but this is not a bil problem,  it's a wife problem.", "NTA, but personally I would stay with your wife over Thanksgiving. I understand not wanting to be around her brother and that he\u2019s a point of contention in your relationship. But it sounds like she\u2019s vulnerable to being manipulated by him and it would probably be better for you both to deal with his presence together, as partners.

I would be saying the exact same thing in your position. Until he makes an active effort to pay you back that money I wouldn\u2019t even entertain \u201cforgiving\u201d him. Your wife is a MAJOR AH for agreeing to this without consulting you first. Stick to your guns and don\u2019t enable that criminal! It\u2019ll start with him attending thanksgiving and then before you know it he\u2019ll weasel his way back in completely. All while likely just expecting his debt to magically be forgiven and you made to look like an AH anytime you bring it up. Don\u2019t let the cycle continue. If he wants to be forgiven he has a LOT of work to do on his part before you should let him even step through your front door.", "NTA and it's you're right regardless if his family forgives him, they didn't get ripped off by him in the amount of $5K.", "NTA. She put herself in this position. He might be worth a chance IF she had laid it out beforehand and respected you and given you the choice/veto.  And if he had apologized to you with monetary amends. But she was counting on you not making a scene when he just showed up. This family system is still effed up big time. She lied to and manipulated you. Were I you, I might make clear to my spouse that playing happy families on thanksgiving was the least of their worries because they are in danger of no longer being married, and if they\u2019d like to avoid that marriage counseling and individual therapy for her is the only option.", "NTA-  I would tell her simply- forgiveness is not available upon demand, that's not how that works. This particular bit of forgiveness has a price tag. It's going to cost $5k plus the cost of the bond out of jail. If it means that much to the \"family\" then they can pass the hat. But I have to assume that absent the effort to make amends for the damage, any apology that comes without amends is insincere and will not be accepted. And finally, I am not the one that is forcing you to make this choice. I have done nothing but be victimized and somehow, the answer is for me to be further victimized by being made a scapegoat.

We all understand substance abuse, the journey back from addiction and getting back on your feet. I'm happy he has (apparently) recovered and has made amends with his family. What he hasn't done however is apologize to you.

However, sounds like you are not willing at all to forgive, which I believe is a major character flaw in a family unit. I believe that if your wife\u2019s brother is truly remorseful and sorry, you should be open to have a civil discussion with him, and try to set up some payment method so he can give you guys the money he owes you. If he is truly clean and remorseful, I don\u2019t see why he would not agree to give you back the money he stole.

As hard as it is to choose between a brother and a husband, she should choose to be true to you because you are her life partner - you should be most important. Sounds like she makes a lot of decisions by herself, big ones at that (5k is a lot of money). \n\nAnyways, as sucky as this situation is, it\u2019s definitely fixable.

He has been clean for 6 months. \n\nAt no point during any of this did I try and make my partner be OK with seeing or interacting with my brother in any way. I informed him that I was starting over with my brother since he'd decided to actively get help. I told my partner he did not have to join me in this. He took his own time and he has now decided to forgive him and support him. This stuff cannot be forced. Your wife needs to realize that.", "Your wife doesn\u2019t seem to have any redirect for you. First she essentially steals from you by using joint funds for something you didn\u2019t agree on, that she continually tells you that you\u2019re the problem when it comes to her brother? BIL isn\u2019t your problem, your wife is.", "If her brother is going to be there and you are not, find a way for your wife not to take money from your shared account without your consent or knowledge, AGAIN", "Look I see your view but I just don't think it's all about you. \n\nYou don't need to forgive him but you can't demand that his own family doesn't at least try.\n \nYou can share a meal.", "If they did ambush you kick them all out right away. As much as addicts need help you are in no way obligated to do so and your wife taking money from a SHARED account. Maybe therapy who knows but that\u2019s not okay and you don\u2019t need to allow him into your home and your wife needs a reality check even if it\u2019s her brother she\u2019s being used. If he\u2019s changed great but also maybe not true so i wouldnt take a chance either", "NtA - She wasnt even going to warn you .\n\nAlso - you're her husband, she should choose you. We see so many times where spouses dont back up the other spouse with family matters and it really harms their relationship.\n\nYour wife already made her chouce.", "It feels like an ambush because it was supposed to be.\n\nDo yourself a favor, Plan your out now.  Gather important Documents and valuables and get them to a friends house now.", "Sounds like getting steamrolled and having your boundaries stomped.\n\nYou told this guy what he needed to do to get back into your good graces, and he just hasn't.", "OP, it is an ambush. And you need to be clear with your wife that he is not welcome and that you will not be ambushed on thanksgiving. Not that you\u2019re going to leave - that if he shows up, *he* will be removed. If your wife wants to spend thanksgiving with him, then someone else can host.", "Yeah, your wife is a major AH. I\u2019d be more pissed that she gave away $5K of your money and bailed him out of jail, and then pulls this. Her behavior is unacceptable. Do you have kids together?", "Mike needs to show up with the $10,000 h promised on a non holiday first. He had $$ to start a business?? Where\u2019s YOUR $$? NTA", "You need to protect your assets so he doesn\u2019t con her again while he\u2019s there\u2026and you aren\u2019t. In another reply I suggested leaving but now I\u2019m thinking you should stay and be yourself. They have no problem ruining your holiday, and you need to run him off before he scams your wife again, and not care if their holiday is ruined. They brought it on themselves.  He\u2019s a liar, and so is your wife. Lock down your assets. There\u2019s no way this holiday is going to go well, and I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with your wife\u2019s stupidity, duplicity and disloyalty.", "NTA\n\nThat's as toxic and manipulative as hell.\n\nIf he's doing so well for the last year, then why weren't you paid $500/month for the first ten months of his new business?\n\nHonestly, I would cancel Thanksgiving all together! If your wife wants to visit with her family, she can travel to see them.\n\nIn __no way__ would I want my in-laws, including the bil, in my house after trying to pull a stunt like that.\n\nI'd take a __MUCH__ harder stance than you are.", "It's great his new buisness is doing well...I think his first step would be to arrange a repayment plan with you both and then follow-up on that commitment.\nIf he has a gambling addiction and is in recovery that seems like an obvious step.\nNTA OP your wife needs to acknowledge her part in this also. She lied again! You asked point blank if he was coming she avoided it. Uggggh why is your wife being such a coward in this? Wasn't that 5000.00 dollars partly her money too?\nI don't know OP..I think you both need to see a counselor and get on the same page in terms of supporting eachother.", "If he\u2019s really been clean and doing better all this time, why has he not reached out to make amends to you long before now? Forgiveness doesn\u2019t require an intervention. Your wife is WAY out of line with this stunt and if Mike is onboard, it makes me doubt that he\u2019s legitimately working a program or legitimately sorry.", "Your wife is an asshole", "Well then now comes the time to decide if you want this to be your life forever.  A year's worth of counseling and taking the major step to separate finances after having them combined beforehand means you've done your due diligence and tried to make things work.  The problem is that your wife *isn't* trying, she's just carrying on like before.  Sorry dude, it sucks that you have to face down a decision like this.", "Not un common to have a blind spot for your own flesh and blood. Which is why in this instance you should have had the final say on whether he attends this holiday", "How much more do you plan to give of yourself to make this work, while she does whatever she wants with no thought to the magnitude of the damage she does to you and your marriage? I think there are tons of far better women out there who wouldn\u2019t dream of doing this to you. Stop fighting this losing battle and find someone you can be happy with.", "NTA You should not allow him in your home no matter what your wife and her family say.  It's very hard to set boundaries with enablers but you have every right to. Don't  you leave, make your wife leave and celebrate somewhere else. Holidays are always great for an ambush!!", "I have a soft spot for my useless baby brother, too. He is a bit of a mooch but he\u2019s never outright stolen 5k from me, so there\u2019s that.\n\nI do have sympathy for your wife, but she has to understand that there has to be AT LEAST a repayment plan in place, with the first payment made, before she could possibly expect you to accept the man in your house again. It isn\u2019t about an apology, it\u2019s about making amends.", "INFO\n\nHow long ago was the incident with Mike?\nHow long is this visit supposed to be? Days or just for the meal?\nHas there been other attempts to get Mike and you in the same place?\nHow long has your wife known Mike planned to come?", "He did get an apology when he came to the house and his wife was not home.", "You literally could\u2019ve pressed charges on all of them. The fact that you stayed married to her should\u2019ve been her wake-up call. She didn\u2019t. She just got you to cave bc poor little her was charmed by her brothers smooth talking pfft. She knew what she was doing. She was going to ambush you on thanksgiving bc all of them forgave him and it\u2019s now you that\u2019s ruining everything in their eyes. They want you to forgive everything they do every time bc they themselves will never change.", "You're minimizing what she and her family did and are doing still.\n\nIf she took that money without your agreement, she stole.", "But he could come with the 5K. And still respect the HARD  boundary in place.", "$5K? No. Adjust that shit for interest and inflation\u2026amortized interest. It was a down payment on a house. Depending on when they bought their house, they may have paid $10-$30K more than what they could have originally bought the house for, 30 year interest rate, that could be an additional $10K paid in interest. That $5K invested as principle on a house could be an adjusted value of $50K.", "Yeah I'm surprised OP was so laid back about his wife lying to his face about the brother coming. \n\nI come from a family full of drug addicts and I've seen family members (clean ones) ruin their marriage because they spent too much time and energy trying to take care of their siblings/parents/children with drug addictions and going behind their partners back to do it.", "Yeah. He\u2019s going to have serious trust issues. This is the second time she has gone behind his back. In this case, she lied about it when asked. It\u2019s going to be hard to get pass that.", "I hate that phrase \"but family\". I don't mix with most of my mom's family because of a cousin. No one talks to her, but they tolerate her for my aunt's sake. I told them to get lost cause I'm not putting up with her. I just don't go to events. Toxic family isn't worth your mental health.", "The wife doesn't seem to see op as family. And what else is she keeping from him?", "maybe Mike knows his \"charm\" holds no sway with OP!", "Not married, but I'll get salty before we've hit 1K...one of my favorite \"relationship\" rules with money is to set a limit on how much can be spent without BOTH parties discussing it (applies to shared funds primarily, although I have one couple of friends who have a \"percentage\" of individual funds the other partner needs a notification on prior to spending...I think that's more like a \"cool off\" period they built in than a voting situation though).  \nOP's wife took out what is objectively quite a lot of money without talking to her partner...not cool!", "Yeah, I see this going another way.\n\nHe started a new business and you all welcome to invest in it., because it's doing so well he is guaranteed to pay you back in a year or 2. /s\n\nI've seen tnis hustle a few too many times with an addict uncle, it takes more than a year to change \"bad habits\".\n\nTruth is you kind of forced to go clean once you hit rock bottom and have no source to fund your habits. \n\nEven if he has changed or wants to change, if people forgive/enable  addicts and they start having \"ways to fund\" their habits again. There are risks of relapses.", "Exactly!  It sounds like OP\u2019s in laws are trying to bully him into forgiving Mike, and that kind of thing can come back to bite all parties involved in the asscheeks.", "I would keep a strict eye on the banking accounts! She gave him money before, even though supposedly clean a year\u2026\u2026you never know!", "Yeah dude. What else is she doing behind your back you don\u2019t know about?", "Right? OP is NTA and has every right not to forgive, but if Mike offered even $20 a week or something it might help heal some of the anger.", "Oh, trust me, there's no business, and he isn't clean.  I know addicts, and I know enablers.   Addicts lie--and then enablers get drawn into the web of lies as well. \n\nOP--the problem is your wife can't draw boundaries.   You've made a really clear boundary around your BIL.  But she's the weak link in the chain fence.  Therefore you have to draw your boundary around HER.  It's one of the only ways enablers can be brought to understand what they're doing.   You're 100% right, and I salute you for your clarity.  \n\nYou're doing this to protect yourself AND ultimately, your wife, even if she can't see it.  She really needs to go to a co-dependent support group.  She's not helping her brother; she's just prolonging his addiction.", "There is a good chance that he simply is selling his works. \n\nIt's pretty easy to start."]}
