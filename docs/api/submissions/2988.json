Her parents are flying in tomorrow night and are staying with us until Saturday.  Her sister and her family live a couple hours away so they are coming just for the day on Thursday.  One family member that I specifically asked about was her younger brother, Mike.  \n\nMike has struggled with substance abuse and gambling for as long as I've been with my wife.  Shortly after my wife and I got married, he conned my wife out of about $5K.  She pulled the money from our shared account without talking to me about it.  The money was supposed to be for a down payment on a house that Mike was going to renovate and flip.  He \"promised\" my wife that he would give her more than double back after he sold the house.  \n\nWell, he didn't even buy the house.  He used the money to pay off some gambling debts, go on a bender, and gambled the rest away.  Cherry on top was that we had to pay to bail him out of jail after he got caught breaking into a hardware store near the end of his bender.  After that, I told my wife I was done with her brother and want nothing to do with him.  She tried to talk me out of it by saying \"he's still family\" and all that BS that enablers like to say.  \n\nHe showed up at our house about 6-months after that but I was the only one home.  He said he wanted to talk to his sister but I told him to leave before I call the cops.  He tried to apologize, but I told him that unless he has $5K to put in my hand, I don't want to hear a word he has to say.  I told my wife what happened and she called me out for being a jerk to her brother when he was trying to apologize.  I just don't trust him.\n\nWhen we were planning Thanksgiving, I was told by my wife that Mike is not attending.  I specifically asked and she said he isn't coming.  But, last night my MIL called for a final chat before they fly out to make sure they didn't need to bring anything else.  My wife had her on speaker and MIL asked if my wife had heard from Mike.  My wife quickly took her off speaker and left the room.\n\nWhen she came back, she immediately started trying to explain.  She said that Mike had apologized to everyone in the family and has been totally clean for almost a year.  She said he's started his own business and is doing really well.  She said that she invited him to Thanksgiving because it's supposed to be about family and coming together.  She said that everyone in the family has forgiven him, and she needs me to forgive him too.\n\nI told her that if Mike shows up, I will leave.  I told her that I have forgiven her for giving him that money without talking to me about it, but I haven't forgiven him and I don't want to see him.  She asked me to do it for her because it's important to her and I told her that this is a hard boundary for me and if he comes, I go.  \n\nShe said I'm putting her in an impossible position to choose between her brother and her husband and I need to forgive him like everyone else has.", "created_utc": 1669147490, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z23fj3/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_wont_help_and_i_will/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife is a huge AH who has a problem with respect and telling the truth. She knew your feelings but went behind your back anyway and kept it from you. If her mother hadnt asked, you wouldn't have found out until Mike showed up at your house on Thanksgiving. That is some next level disrespect from your spouse! I wouldn't trust her not to take more money from your shared account to give to her brother during Thanksgiving. I'd suggest some marriage counseling so the therapist can tell her how wrong her actions are within a marriage. She's not acting like you have a partnership.

And then tell him what is acceptable to you, which is repayment.

Instead of taking the zero negotiation and hard line you have, you'd likely be better suited to a more proactive and intentional approach.\n\nMike did terrible stuff to your family. If he has truly changed, you could approach him with something like this:\n\n\"Hey Mike, I've heard you have been invited to Thanksgiving at our house. Due to how you acted in the past, specifically how you took 5k from us and never paid it back, I am not okay with you coming. That said, if you were willing to start paying us back that money, it would go a long way towards rebuilding the bridges that were burned, specifically in me being willing to let you join us for Thanksgiving.\"\n\nAlso, your wife has some MAJOR issues with putting others before you. You and she should have each other's back, instead, she keeps going around yours. \n\nYou two should seek couples counseling around this issue and she should look into GAM-ANON.\n\nYou are justified in your reasons for not letting Mike come, but what's justified isn't always the right or best course of action. I'm not saying you should lay down and take it, but instead consider taking control of the situation with intentional, solution-minded actions.", "An impossible situation to choose between her (addict) brother or her husband\n\nThis is nowhere near an impossible choice.

If you have such contempt for him show the same emotions to your wife who ACTUALLY stole from you. Honestly ESH. Your wife sucks because she has continually showed she puts her brother and family before you. You for staying with her and subjecting yourself to this. And the brother for obvious reasons", "If your wife outright told you that Mike wasn\u2019t coming and your MIL accidentally clued you in, you still have a wife problem, my dude.", "Thiiiisss, exactly", "Hopefully, you take all of your valuables with you.", "Can you maybe set a limit for him to be there? Maybe something like he can come for dinner but has to leave after an hour? I'm just trying to help you figure out a way that your wife won't flip out on you, you're in a tough spot.", "I feel like that would be a fair compromise. It does sound like its a to late to change the plans though", "Thats fair. I just don't think building walls is the answer", "You basically just said don't blame the con men and Indian scammers who steal money from old people because they are gullible so its their fault they were taken advantage of. \n\n\nYou certainly can blame Mike, and you CreepyCarrie213 sound like a scammer yourself.", "Probably not.  Apparently, everyone else in my wife's family has forgiven him and want him there.  So I am severely outnumbered on this.", "That\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Totally agree, but I don\u2019t think OP is the A H, because not wanting him in the house after he basically stole from you is fair\u2026 but compromise (at least in the future) should be maid, or it can potential ruin the marriage", "Sorry that I\u2019m smart and use common sense. My mother has fell victim to those scammers and I blame her just as much. I said in the post the brother was not a good person for obvious reasons but as others said he would not of been able to do anything with the money or continue his plan if his sister OPs wife was smart and stood her ground in saying no. Instead she stole from a joint account and gave it to her brother, if it were me I would of divorced anyway that is unacceptable behavior and with how his wife is acting it\u2019s clear she will always put her brother and family first.", "That sucks. Your choices are suck it up or be the bad guy, I'd be pissed also. Your wife needs to stop doing things behind your back.", "Their forgiveness means nothing because they are not the victims in this story.", "honestly, you aren't. the answer becomes none of them get to stay there.\n\nyou and your wife both get a say in who stays in your home. if your wife wants to play the well the whole family agrees card. well, the whole family can find a last minute hotel.\n\nyour BIL hasn't asked for your forgiveness. probably because he knows that you are the only person who won't just say- yes! of course! you are going to want to see that he's clean and making progress. you are going to want to see him doing things like paying back the $5k he got your wife to take from your joint account.\n\nand honestly, part of this needs to include you and your wife starting counselling. it's awesome that your wife is so supportive of her brother and her family. but it can't be at the cost of you and the family that she's making with you or why the heck did she bother marrying you?", "I'm not saying it was.", "Mike has victimized everyone around him in some way or another.", "Yes, but your refusal to forgive is for something he specifically did to you. Your wife\u2019s relatives don\u2019t get to decide if you forgive or not. Their issues and forgiveness is completely separate from your issue."]}
