Tell your husband that when the boy falls asleep, he's more than welcome to carry him back to his room. \nChildren sleeping in bed with parents is actually a very common issue.\nMom's typically want it, dad's don't.\nAs a young mom I loved when my son would sleep in bed with us, as an older adult, I do understand why the dad's don't like it.", "NTA\n\nLocking a child out of a room when the child is scared and seeking you guys out is absolutely ridiculous. When my ex wife and I were together and our daughter was around that age, if she came crying to us, I'd take her back to her room and comfort her and get her back to bed. I would lay on the floor next to her bed so if she woke up again, she knew daddy was right there for her. \n\nGranted, she's my firstborn and had me wrapped around her finger since the INSTANT she was born, but still. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "ESH. Locking a scared 4 year old out of your bedroom is a recipe for disaster and setting him up to never trust you. But he is too old to be sleeping in your bed when one parent is unhappy with it. You are coddling him and neglecting your husbands boundaries for a child that actually needs to learn to sleep by himself. The issue isn't him climbing into your bed, it's you letting him stay there all night.\n\nYou need to be comforting him then sending him to his own bed. Give him some cuddles, then pick him up, take him to his bed, tuck him in, give him a kiss and hug, assure him he's safe, tell him if he needs you he can come to you, make sure he knows that his bed is his safe place, then go back to your own bed. If he's really worked up then sit with him until he's calmed down at his bed. Try to figure out what's causing the nightmares. Try night lights, soft toys, just comfort items. But him staying in your bed should not be the norm if the other parent is unhappy with it. Don't lock him out, but don't let him run your relationship either.", "NAH. Your husband has a valid point about your son sleeping in his own room. You both need to get restful sleep without being woken.\n\nI also get wanting to comfort your son with nightmares, but should also have him return to his own bed.", "ESH/nah you need to figure out a solution together. You need to agree if it\u2019s okay for your son to sleep with you both or if the marriage bed is just that. An intimate place for you and your husband. It sounds like you need to find a compromise together on this because that is the deeper issue beyond just a lock", "NAH. Let the kid come in and comfort him but then  take him back to his room and stay until he falls asleep again. Sleeping with you guys is NOT a long term solution.", "NTA!!!!\n\nI have memories of having nightmares and my mom yelling at me to get out. I was so horrified, but I waited, trembling and crying until I could tell she'd fallen asleep, and curled myself up in the corner just to be near her, and feel a little safer.\n\nI was older than your son was at the time, but I still remember how it felt to be pushed away when I was already so scared.", "NTA. 4 year olds waking up with nightmares is pretty common. He's scared, he's dark, and he wants to be with you. He's four years old. This is normal.\n\nHe won't still be crawling in to your bed in high school.", "NTA \n\nIt's perfectly normal for a distressed child to seek security. I could never imagine locking out a child that was upset.", "NTA. If your son is scared and coming to you for comfort and instead is locked out it may make things much worse. Nothing is more frightening to a small child then thinking they are cut off from their parents.", "Okay my SIL was like you and her kid is now 8 and can only sleep with them. Your husband has a point.", "Esh. The solution to the problem is one that not only addresses the issue of your child not sleeping in their own but also is acceptable to both you and your husband. So far y'all are 0-3.", "ESH - you both need to address why your son is getting out of bed at night.", "INFO: why does this make your hubby upset? Is your son interrupting intimate time or something?", "NTA your son is only 4 years old!!!!! It doesn\u2019t sound okay to deprive your child of a safety net that he feels with his parents. I get that children need to learn to sleep on their own, but this is just a terrible approach.\n\nHusband could\u2019ve suggested having a sit down and speaking with your son to find out what\u2019s bothering him throughout the night and how to make it easier for him. Not shut him out literally. He\u2019s 4 it may be a change in schedule or bad dreams, etc\u2026 as parents it is up to y\u2019all to find out and figure out how to help him. \n\nGod forbid there\u2019s an emergency, anything can happen in the night, if he\u2019s not feeling well and the door is locked, both of you in deep sleep unaware and he can\u2019t reach you guys. This is not to scare you, but I hope it\u2019s enough for you guys to try to find a better solution.", "NAH Children need to learn to not be afraid and self soothe. Sleeping with your parents is not a long term solution to the problem. Encouraging your child to sleep on their own and help mitigate the anxiety is more helpful than allowing him to co sleep in the long term. Some people advocate co sleeping but it's a buzzkill for marital intimacy.", "NAH. My daughter comes in for a snuggle at night regularly, but she is allowed to come in once a night and only for about 5 minutes. It\u2019s a good compromise with being there for the kid, but also not destroying mine and my husband\u2019s rest.", "NTA\n\nLocking your clearly terrified son out of your room is going to distress him further, and probably cause lifelong trauma.\n\nSounds like you're doing the right thing by comforting him and taking him back to bed. Does he also have a nightlight, or maybe a security blanket or toy? If it's a nightly issue he may be feeling insecure in some other areas of his life, and probably needs some help working through it.\n\nIf your hubby can't see the damage that's being caused by locking the door then he's the asshole here. Could be part of his male upbringing, ignoring perceived weakness as a means of eliminating it.", "NTA Talk about traumatizing an already frightened child! If your husband has such an issue with it then let him get up and comfort your son back to sleep in his own room.", "NTA but your husband is. 4 is still very little. Our boy crawled in bed with us almost every night until he was 5. If he needed us, he needed us, and we wouldn\u2019t shut him out. Was it always comfortable? No. But our baby was, and that was what was important.", "NTA he\u2019s scared and needs comfort.  he\u2019s also only 4, hub is a giant AH.", "NTA but more INFO is needed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can understand installing a lock on your door if your son was too old for this kind of behavior but that does not seem to be the case. That being said, when your 4 year old wakes up in the middle of the night to sleep in your and your husband's room, does he wake either of you up and if he does, is the movement he makes going to your room alone enough to wake either of you up or just when he gets into your bed? I ask this because if your husband needs to work early in the morning, your son waking him up during the night may be affecting how he performs at work, let alone his health and if he is waking up solely by your son going to your room at night instead of just him climbing into your bed with him, him sleeping in another room won't fix anything. While installing lock  is extreme, I can still understand why he would if this was happening.\n\nAnother thing you should take into consideration is if your son really is having nightmares or he simply says he's having them to get attention. I know when I was a kid, I would make things up or greatly exaggerated the truth to get attention. If so, then it would seem that you are rewarding behavior that should not be rewarded.\n\nLastly, while putting a lock on the door is extreme, I think making your husband sleep in another room may be less than but still an extreme measure as well. Tell me, have you tried any other methods to stop your son from having nightmares so he can sleep in his room (night lite, reading him a story, staying with him in his room until he fell asleep, etc). If you have exhausted every possibly avenue to stop your son from having nightmares that caused him to want to sleep in your and husband's room, then yea, having your husband sleep in another room may be the last best option, since putting a lock on your door would stop your son from entering your room if an emergency occurs (such as a fire, burglar, etc.). If not, then I would discuss with your husband what both of you can do fix the situation before taking either extreme measure.", "YTA\n\nIf your son knocks on the door in the middle of the night, you and your husband need to take turns getting up and taking him back to bed. \n\nStay with him in his bed if need be.\n\nIt'll be a short phase if he learns that you'll help him back to bed.", "NTA...I am the parent of a an almost 21 year old.........I miss the days when she used to sneak into our bed", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he appears frightened enough, he will be allowed to stay the whole night, he will attempt this over and over, hoping for the outcome he wants (staying in your bed). He needs to *know* that this is not an option.\n\nConsistency is not just for discipline - kids find comfort and safety in the predictable - even when they don\u2019t like it. They need to know where the rules and boundaries are. If sometimes he can sleep with you, and other times he\u2019s not allowed, it will only make him way more stressed and anxious wondering if he\u2019ll be able to this time. \n\nHe needs to know that you love and support him, and that his room is a safe place to be.

Then I moved to the landing on the stairs between the floor their bedroom was on, and the upper floor my bedroom was on. Eventually I got tired of sleeping on the floor and developed coping mechanisms to stay in my room. \n\nI found that what really helped was a book on tape (it was the 90s). A stuffed animal to cuddle - it was enormous, so it felt like cuddling a person. They also offered me bribes (if you can stay in bed for a month, we\u2019ll go to Legoland, etc).  I knew they were there if I really needed them, but I also knew I was causing them anguish and stress and frustration by waking them constantly, and after a while did my best to avoid waking them up if I could.", "Have you both discussed if you allow your son to sleep in the bed you share? Was this ever a conversation?", "I did not suggest locking the door.
