If he's really worked up then sit with him until he's calmed down at his bed. Try to figure out what's causing the nightmares. Try night lights, soft toys, just comfort items.

That being said, when your 4 year old wakes up in the middle of the night to sleep in your and your husband's room, does he wake either of you up and if he does, is the movement he makes going to your room alone enough to wake either of you up or just when he gets into your bed? I ask this because if your husband needs to work early in the morning, your son waking him up during the night may be affecting how he performs at work, let alone his health and if he is waking up solely by your son going to your room at night instead of just him climbing into your bed with him, him sleeping in another room won't fix anything. While installing lock  is extreme, I can still understand why he would if this was happening.\n\nAnother thing you should take into consideration is if your son really is having nightmares or he simply says he's having them to get attention. I know when I was a kid, I would make things up or greatly exaggerated the truth to get attention. If so, then it would seem that you are rewarding behavior that should not be rewarded.\n\nLastly, while putting a lock on the door is extreme, I think making your husband sleep in another room may be less than but still an extreme measure as well. Tell me, have you tried any other methods to stop your son from having nightmares so he can sleep in his room (night lite, reading him a story, staying with him in his room until he fell asleep, etc). If you have exhausted every possibly avenue to stop your son from having nightmares that caused him to want to sleep in your and husband's room, then yea, having your husband sleep in another room may be the last best option, since putting a lock on your door would stop your son from entering your room if an emergency occurs (such as a fire, burglar, etc.). If not, then I would discuss with your husband what both of you can do fix the situation before taking either extreme measure.", "YTA\n\nIf your son knocks on the door in the middle of the night, you and your husband need to take turns getting up and taking him back to bed. \n\nStay with him in his bed if need be.\n\nIt'll be a short phase if he learns that you'll help him back to bed.", "NTA...I am the parent of a an almost 21 year old.........I miss the days when she used to sneak into our bed", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He needs to *know* that this is not an option.\n\nConsistency is not just for discipline - kids find comfort and safety in the predictable - even when they don\u2019t like it. They need to know where the rules and boundaries are. If sometimes he can sleep with you, and other times he\u2019s not allowed, it will only make him way more stressed and anxious wondering if he\u2019ll be able to this time, and way more upset and scared when you *do* direct him back to bed. If one parent allows something, and another doesn\u2019t, it will only make him upset wondering why one parent seems (in his mind) to care more about him than the other (which is, in *most* cases, NOT TRUE). Sometimes being a parent is hard, and it\u2019s not fair if one parent is making it harder by making the other one the bad guy. You need your sleep, and the privacy of your room, and so does your husband. You need to be parents here - together. \n\nYour kid needs to know that you love and support him, and that his room is a safe place to be. And I say this as a child who had persistent insomnia and nighttime fear, and would regularly try to leave my room and cry and beg my parents to stay in their room.\n\nThey didn\u2019t lock the door, but they were absolutely firm on \u201cthis is not where you are sleeping.\u201d  Both of them. Invariably. And BOY did I try to lean on one, and then the other, to see if one would crack. I learned that I couldn\u2019t play them off each other, which I think was incredibly important. \n\nThis is what really worries me about this situation:\n\n> I told him **he** should sleep in a different room if he had an issue with our son sleeping with **us** during an argument over this and now he\u2019s mad at me.\n\nFirst, you are acting as if he is being unreasonable when you created the problem in the first place. His solution would probably work if you were on board, but it\u2019s not empathetic or responsive parenting either. But the reason he is suggesting such drastic measures is because you haven\u2019t been taking him seriously when he\u2019s been voicing his need to not have your child in your shared bed.\n\nYou are allowing a situation of resentment between you and your spouse to fester. Your relationship is important to maintain also. Think of it this way: he values your time together. He is fighting to keep your room *your shared room.* My recommendation? That you respect this and remember not to lose sight of your relationship because of your kids. That you continue redirecting your son to his own room. What I think is fair if you are unwilling to do so? *YOU* are the one to sleep elsewhere. Perhaps in your son\u2019s room with him. I don\u2019t think this is ideal, but it\u2019s more fair than kicking your husband out. If that seems ridiculous to you, like it does to me, then perhaps you\u2019d best reconsider what you are suggesting your husband do.\n\nI also want you to think carefully about how seeing his actions be the cause of a rift between his parents could affect him in the long-run. You two need to get on the same parenting page. \n\nMy parents agreed \u201cno kids in the bed.\u201d So after I had been thwarted, and they put me back to bed, I would grab a blanket and sleep on the floor outside their door. They did NOT recommend this as a compromise - they simply pretended not to notice that\u2019s what I was doing (I thought I was being sneaky). As long as I didn\u2019t wake them up unnecessarily, they let me be. They got some sleep, knew I was okay, and I felt a little safer. Then I moved to the landing on the stairs between the floor their bedroom was on, and the upper floor my bedroom was on. Eventually I got tired of sleeping on the floor and developed coping mechanisms to stay in my room. \n\nI found that what really helped was a book on tape (it was the 90s). A stuffed animal to cuddle - it was enormous, so it felt like cuddling a person. They also offered me bribes (if you can stay in bed for a month, we\u2019ll go to Legoland, etc).  I knew they were there if I really needed them, but I also knew I was causing them anguish and stress and frustration by waking them constantly, and after a while did my best to avoid waking them up if I could.", "Have you both discussed if you allow your son to sleep in the bed you share?

I reminded them that if they woke up and needed me, they could come get me. When they did need me, we did the same thing. I went to sit with them until they fell asleep again. For the first week, it was up to 3x per night. (Yes, it was a whole process.) After that, it started to slowly get better. I really believe me making sure they always went straight back to bed immediately made the process more effective. \n\nThe kid with night terrors needed one additional thing. I told that one the red light on the ceiling (smoke alarm light) was a \"bad dream detector\" and it \"scans the room and will zap them away before they could reach you\" You can see it zapped one when it blinks. (They blinked every 30 mins or so for 5 secs.

Let him sleep with you, in evolutionary terms this is what we did as a species for most of our existence - this is also what many cultures still do. Why does your husband get to sleep with your warmth and support and love, but your four year old has to cope without?", "When that happens, why doesn't one of you go back to his room with him and stay with him and provide comfort and safety until he falls back asleep? \n\nI know this might be annoying but nightmares are normal at that age and your son needs comfort.", "ESH. Your son needs consistency and you're not providing it. Hubby shouldn't have suggested locking the door cause that's incredibly stupid and dangerous but as a parent, when my child had a nightmare I went to his room and comforted him in there to show him his safe space is actually safe. Co sleeping can be a 50/50 good or bad scenario. My two best friends co slept with their kids; one managed to get her kid into their own bed whilst the other has three kids between 10 and three that sleep in their bed. Kid number three was conceived whilst the other two were in the bed asleep and frankly I was disgusted by that on so many levels.", "NTA.  I\u2019m not sure if any of the esh people have actually had kids but you\u2019ll probably find this comes in ebbs and flows.  Some weeks he might come into your bed a lot and then maybe not for weeks.  I promised myself I would never turn my son away because I remember how unsafe I felt when I was a kid and my parents did that to me.  It does nothing for anxiety I can tell you that much.  I can guarantee he\u2019ll grow out of it and definitely won\u2019t be coming to get comfort from you when he\u2019s older so give it to him now.  They are only young once and when he\u2019s gone you\u2019ll miss it, he will only have good memories of the parents who made him feel safe and loved when he was scared.", "NTA. Children naturally seek their parents when they are afraid. Locking a child alone in the night is just cruel imo. And what if he hurts himself?", "he is four! what is your husband thinking?! This will pass.  Don't lock your door.  Children always need to be able to access their parents  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, having nightmares can be a phase. My dad always talked me through it when putting me to bed. Like you change the route of your dreams. And if I did wake up, he take me back to bed and we get a glass of water or something. There are work arounds to this.", "From the childs perspective, being locked out when they need you could lead to distrust, feeling adandoned and possibly even betrayed. When I was 3 or 4 I remember multiple occasions where I would have a nightmare and would try and wake my mom up and my step dad had locked the door. I would sit outside the door crying until my sister who was 12 years older than me heard me and  comforted me and put me back to bed than went to her room and went to sleep. \n\nSleeping in their own bed won't hurt kids but not allowing your kid to seek you out when they believe they need ypu will hurt them and could potentially so damage to any future relationship because he'll remember reaching for you and being denied. 30+ years later and I have clear memories of cuddling against my mom's door crying and my sister coming to my rescue. It didn't hurt me to learn to self soothe in my own bed after I had reassurance and some comfort. But being locked out of my mom's bedroom when little me needed her and my sister being there is definitely a core memory. But you know what I don't have memory of?  Being put back in my own bed and learning to be ok. So clearly that didnt cause me trauma or damage. However you decide to handle your son's nightmares or resulting coping skills needs to be discussed and decided on WITH your husband. You are a team and assuming you share the common goal of raising your son to be happy confident adjusted human being, locking him out will only hinder that goal and put potential strain on your future relationship. I don't have an answer to what you should do, to each their own,  other than telling you locking him out of your bedroom and ignoring your scared child is not the answer.", "Nah. He is 4 and if he needs his parents then he needs his parents.", "NTA! Only humans think that letting the young ones sleep away from their parents/group is a good idea. Children no matter the  specie need the safety of their parents amw9round them, and it is deep in our DNA. While a 4 years old understands during the day that no saber-toothed tiger will snack him away, he won't be able to keep his instincts under control during the night. This will not magically disappear if you ignore his desire to be close to his loved ones. Kids whose parents closed the doors when they are scared don't become more brave, but more insecure (there are studies out there, especially about letting babies cry themselves into sleep. Don't do that!). A kid running to their parents at night doesn't need discipline but security.\n\nHowever, there are usually no dangers your kid needs protection for but you are in the very dangerous situation to not get a good sleep. One way to solve this is to find a ritual you do every night and to make your kid feels secured in his own room. More lights would be one way, or you \"order\" some monster repellent spray, a dreamcatcher for bad dreams (worked wonders with me) or anything else. Rituals you do every night also help. But it is also important that he always knows that if it fails, he can always come to you. Be there for him (either in his room or yours) and discuss the next day what you can change. Don't worry, your kid WILL grow out of it, and all kids have their own pace. Some kids never asked their parents to sleep in their bed while others are 8 and older when they finally stay in their own bed.", "My step father would do this when I was little. I'm an adult I still have night time anxiety. When I was younger it was worse than it is now.\n\nYou could always get a bigger bed for your son. (A queen bed) so you can lay down with him comfortably in his room. \n\nIt's being compromising because your son deserves to feel safe with the comfort of you being there.\n\nNta.", "NTA, at 4 nightmares are a thing increasingly and you want your kid to feel safe. Maybe him sleeping in the guest room until it gets better is an idea, but locking out a scared kid is not nice. It's stressful I get it, but having kids means getting through those phases...", "He is 4 not 40.", "I had the same experience. I just wanted comfort, I was so scared and wanted help and I got nothing. OP's child is 4, I don't understand why other commenters are acting like he's 30, why is it so awful to comfort a scared child?", "This, my daughter came and got in to bed with us often at night right up to about 9 or 10. My mum used to say its not for ever and she'll stop. And now my daughter is in full teenager strop mode I really miss those late night cuddles lol.", "Me being a whole grown ass woman still sleeping in bed with my mama. Lmao.", "When my kids had nightmares, I would go to their beds with them, until they fell asleep. I often fell asleep in their beds. \n\nI think the security is important, especially at such a young age. I don\u2019t think him sleeping in your bed is a bad thing, but as your husband doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s probably better if you go to your son\u2019s bed.  My husband didn\u2019t tolerate our children in our bed, which is why I went to their beds. When I was a child, my mother would tell us to go back to bed, but our father always stayed with us if we had bad dreams. \n\nWith time, this will stop. My children are now grown, and I look back at those times wistfully.", "Or just knock? That\u2019s what I remember doing at that age. I wasn\u2019t allowed to barge in.", "Jesus fuck I hope you never have children. The kid is FOUR YEARS OLD.", "He's four?!?! FFS", "Yeah, I had friends whose kid was too young to really speak or say that something was wrong. She was still smol. \nShe wandered into their room and woke them up by crawling into their bed, just burning up and sweating a river.\n\nShe\u2019s not a loud kid, wasn\u2019t a loud baby. If they had locked their door, she probably could\u2019ve just been there the entire night like that.\n\nHonestly, they could get a baby gate for their door if they\u2019re that desperate to not have him in their room. But yeah, the kid needs access to his caregivers somehow. At least until he\u2019s old enough to fully communicate.", "This.

My parents opted to get me my own little TV and it worked wonders.", "i think this person parents", "This is the perfect response to OP. One of the hardest things in early parenting is sleep schedules and, OP, if you don't nip this in the bud, you will be exhausted for years to come. Especially if you have another child someday.

I mentioned this to a nurse at my clinic recently. She said that she did the same thing with her son, and everyone warned her that she would still have a teenager sleeping in her bed.\u201d\n\nDespite the warning, the nurse attributes her close connection\u00a0with her now teenage son to those early days in\u00a0the rocker. \u201cA\u00a0few weeks ago, her teenage son came home from school very upset. He didn\u2019t want to talk, and just went to his room and listened to his music, typed on his phone and cried.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe mother gave her son space, and night time came and she went to bed. Just as she was about to turn off her side light, the door opened, and her 15-year-old son padded into the room. He climbed into the bed with her, laid his head on her shoulder and cried. He told her all about the girl that broke his heart, all about the friends who laughed, all about the stresses of being him.\u201d\n\nThey talked for hours in the dark, sharing their thoughts until they both fell asleep in the bed together, she explains. \u201cI was so scared that I would wind up with a teenager who would \u2018need me\u2019 at night, that I never stopped to consider how beautiful that would really be.\u201d", "I understand that, but not every child is the same, and parents need to sleep too, so if putting the child in the bed gives a little more sleep so be it.\n\nI do agree there needs to be something, a friend put a second bed in their kids room so when the kid did come in they just went and slept in the room with them, their partner was a shift worker, so I do understand that side of it, but locking a door is an absolute no in my house. And they feel safe enough to sleep in their beds, tell me when something is wrong, etc.", "Lol, right?

They are literally coming to you because you are safe and they need reassurance. \nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with letting a child sleep with you until they develop their independence. Independence whilst a child is young is not linear, they will go through phases of needing extra reassurance and other phases of feeling confident and independent. \nYour child will not still be sleeping in your bed at 18, they grow up and develop independence on their own at their own rate. \nThere is absolutely no NEED to force your child to be independent just because the western society has this strange fixation on it and it's somehow the current standard.", "Locking the door isn't going to accomplish anything because chances are very good that the child will start crying or knocking on the door and wake you up anyway.

She would \u201ccheck the scary areas\u201d and what not. If I was especially wound up she would sometimes just let me sleep with them. \n\nI turned out fine. But I gaurantee you locking the door will absolutely make this more traumatizing for everyone then it needs to be.\n\nNow that I\u2019m older we\u2019ve realized I just have a very intense imagination. Creatively this was a good thing. Sleep wise it was not. Be careful letting him watch scary movies, if he\u2019s nightmare prone it\u2019s likely to go badly. I remember be irritated as a kid that I my mom vetoed movies that were too scary\u2026until I secretly watched the ring at a friends house. I had to keep the lights on the entire night for a year. For what it\u2019s worth, night lights actually made it worse. I would \u201cimagine up\u201d things in the shadows. Reality was, it was just my creative brain doing what it did best, creating. Would\u2019ve been nice if it could\u2019ve conjured up the tooth fairy or something instead, but it didn\u2019t.\ud83d\ude43\n\nAs an adult I am still very nightmare or stress dream prone. I think it\u2019s probably due to the way I rem sleep. I am a vivid sleeper and I remember almost all my dreams. I was the same way as a kid, which I think is part of the reason I woke up so scared. I didn\u2019t just remember the feeling when I woke up, I would remember the dreams. I tend to wake up on the hour, and while i now fall back asleep for the most part, I think it\u2019s why I\u2019m more awake while dreaming and therefore tend to remember my dreams and have very vivid dreams that feel real. I also lucid dream much more than the average person.\n\nI also think this is part of the reason why I seem to have such a good internal time clock.

Hell he already sleeps in his own bed most of the time. If we can comfort him when he's scared or just show him how loved he is, why wouldn't we? We can nap later in the day if we need to.

Headphones with music helped a lot. But I didn\u2019t have access to those until I was older. Silence let\u2019s my mind wander and imagine things up. A sound machine would have been fantastic, but these weren\u2019t really a thing when I was a kid.
