If he's really worked up then sit with him until he's calmed down at his bed. Try to figure out what's causing the nightmares. Try night lights, soft toys, just comfort items.

That being said, when your 4 year old wakes up in the middle of the night to sleep in your and your husband's room, does he wake either of you up and if he does, is the movement he makes going to your room alone enough to wake either of you up or just when he gets into your bed? I ask this because if your husband needs to work early in the morning, your son waking him up during the night may be affecting how he performs at work, let alone his health and if he is waking up solely by your son going to your room at night instead of just him climbing into your bed with him, him sleeping in another room won't fix anything. While installing lock  is extreme, I can still understand why he would if this was happening.\n\nAnother thing you should take into consideration is if your son really is having nightmares or he simply says he's having them to get attention. I know when I was a kid, I would make things up or greatly exaggerated the truth to get attention. If so, then it would seem that you are rewarding behavior that should not be rewarded.\n\nLastly, while putting a lock on the door is extreme, I think making your husband sleep in another room may be less than but still an extreme measure as well. Tell me, have you tried any other methods to stop your son from having nightmares so he can sleep in his room (night lite, reading him a story, staying with him in his room until he fell asleep, etc). If you have exhausted every possibly avenue to stop your son from having nightmares that caused him to want to sleep in your and husband's room, then yea, having your husband sleep in another room may be the last best option, since putting a lock on your door would stop your son from entering your room if an emergency occurs (such as a fire, burglar, etc.). If not, then I would discuss with your husband what both of you can do fix the situation before taking either extreme measure.", "YTA\n\nIf your son knocks on the door in the middle of the night, you and your husband need to take turns getting up and taking him back to bed. \n\nStay with him in his bed if need be.\n\nIt'll be a short phase if he learns that you'll help him back to bed.", "NTA...I am the parent of a an almost 21 year old.........I miss the days when she used to sneak into our bed", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He needs to *know* that this is not an option.\n\nConsistency is not just for discipline - kids find comfort and safety in the predictable - even when they don\u2019t like it. They need to know where the rules and boundaries are. If sometimes he can sleep with you, and other times he\u2019s not allowed, it will only make him way more stressed and anxious wondering if he\u2019ll be able to this time, and way more upset and scared when you *do* direct him back to bed. If one parent allows something, and another doesn\u2019t, it will only make him upset wondering why one parent seems (in his mind) to care more about him than the other (which is, in *most* cases, NOT TRUE). Sometimes being a parent is hard, and it\u2019s not fair if one parent is making it harder by making the other one the bad guy. You need your sleep, and the privacy of your room, and so does your husband. You need to be parents here - together. \n\nYour kid needs to know that you love and support him, and that his room is a safe place to be. And I say this as a child who had persistent insomnia and nighttime fear, and would regularly try to leave my room and cry and beg my parents to stay in their room.\n\nThey didn\u2019t lock the door, but they were absolutely firm on \u201cthis is not where you are sleeping.\u201d  Both of them. Invariably. And BOY did I try to lean on one, and then the other, to see if one would crack. I learned that I couldn\u2019t play them off each other, which I think was incredibly important. \n\nThis is what really worries me about this situation:\n\n> I told him **he** should sleep in a different room if he had an issue with our son sleeping with **us** during an argument over this and now he\u2019s mad at me.\n\nFirst, you are acting as if he is being unreasonable when you created the problem in the first place. His solution would probably work if you were on board, but it\u2019s not empathetic or responsive parenting either. But the reason he is suggesting such drastic measures is because you haven\u2019t been taking him seriously when he\u2019s been voicing his need to not have your child in your shared bed.\n\nYou are allowing a situation of resentment between you and your spouse to fester. Your relationship is important to maintain also. Think of it this way: he values your time together. He is fighting to keep your room *your shared room.* My recommendation? That you respect this and remember not to lose sight of your relationship because of your kids. That you continue redirecting your son to his own room. What I think is fair if you are unwilling to do so? *YOU* are the one to sleep elsewhere. Perhaps in your son\u2019s room with him. I don\u2019t think this is ideal, but it\u2019s more fair than kicking your husband out. If that seems ridiculous to you, like it does to me, then perhaps you\u2019d best reconsider what you are suggesting your husband do.\n\nI also want you to think carefully about how seeing his actions be the cause of a rift between his parents could affect him in the long-run. You two need to get on the same parenting page. \n\nMy parents agreed \u201cno kids in the bed.\u201d So after I had been thwarted, and they put me back to bed, I would grab a blanket and sleep on the floor outside their door. They did NOT recommend this as a compromise - they simply pretended not to notice that\u2019s what I was doing (I thought I was being sneaky). As long as I didn\u2019t wake them up unnecessarily, they let me be. They got some sleep, knew I was okay, and I felt a little safer. Then I moved to the landing on the stairs between the floor their bedroom was on, and the upper floor my bedroom was on. Eventually I got tired of sleeping on the floor and developed coping mechanisms to stay in my room. \n\nI found that what really helped was a book on tape (it was the 90s). A stuffed animal to cuddle - it was enormous, so it felt like cuddling a person. They also offered me bribes (if you can stay in bed for a month, we\u2019ll go to Legoland, etc).  I knew they were there if I really needed them, but I also knew I was causing them anguish and stress and frustration by waking them constantly, and after a while did my best to avoid waking them up if I could.", "Have you both discussed if you allow your son to sleep in the bed you share?

I reminded them that if they woke up and needed me, they could come get me. When they did need me, we did the same thing. I went to sit with them until they fell asleep again. For the first week, it was up to 3x per night. (Yes, it was a whole process.) After that, it started to slowly get better. I really believe me making sure they always went straight back to bed immediately made the process more effective. \n\nThe kid with night terrors needed one additional thing. I told that one the red light on the ceiling (smoke alarm light) was a \"bad dream detector\" and it \"scans the room and will zap them away before they could reach you\" You can see it zapped one when it blinks. (They blinked every 30 mins or so for 5 secs.

Let him sleep with you, in evolutionary terms this is what we did as a species for most of our existence - this is also what many cultures still do. Why does your husband get to sleep with your warmth and support and love, but your four year old has to cope without?", "When that happens, why doesn't one of you go back to his room with him and stay with him and provide comfort and safety until he falls back asleep? \n\nI know this might be annoying but nightmares are normal at that age and your son needs comfort.", "ESH. Your son needs consistency and you're not providing it. Hubby shouldn't have suggested locking the door cause that's incredibly stupid and dangerous but as a parent, when my child had a nightmare I went to his room and comforted him in there to show him his safe space is actually safe. Co sleeping can be a 50/50 good or bad scenario. My two best friends co slept with their kids; one managed to get her kid into their own bed whilst the other has three kids between 10 and three that sleep in their bed. Kid number three was conceived whilst the other two were in the bed asleep and frankly I was disgusted by that on so many levels.", "NTA.  I\u2019m not sure if any of the esh people have actually had kids but you\u2019ll probably find this comes in ebbs and flows.  Some weeks he might come into your bed a lot and then maybe not for weeks.  I promised myself I would never turn my son away because I remember how unsafe I felt when I was a kid and my parents did that to me.  It does nothing for anxiety I can tell you that much.  I can guarantee he\u2019ll grow out of it and definitely won\u2019t be coming to get comfort from you when he\u2019s older so give it to him now.  They are only young once and when he\u2019s gone you\u2019ll miss it, he will only have good memories of the parents who made him feel safe and loved when he was scared.", "NTA. Children naturally seek their parents when they are afraid. Locking a child alone in the night is just cruel imo. And what if he hurts himself?", "he is four! what is your husband thinking?! This will pass.  Don't lock your door.  Children always need to be able to access their parents  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, having nightmares can be a phase. My dad always talked me through it when putting me to bed. Like you change the route of your dreams. And if I did wake up, he take me back to bed and we get a glass of water or something. There are work arounds to this.", "From the childs perspective, being locked out when they need you could lead to distrust, feeling adandoned and possibly even betrayed. When I was 3 or 4 I remember multiple occasions where I would have a nightmare and would try and wake my mom up and my step dad had locked the door. I would sit outside the door crying until my sister who was 12 years older than me heard me and  comforted me and put me back to bed than went to her room and went to sleep. \n\nSleeping in their own bed won't hurt kids but not allowing your kid to seek you out when they believe they need ypu will hurt them and could potentially so damage to any future relationship because he'll remember reaching for you and being denied. 30+ years later and I have clear memories of cuddling against my mom's door crying and my sister coming to my rescue. It didn't hurt me to learn to self soothe in my own bed after I had reassurance and some comfort. But being locked out of my mom's bedroom when little me needed her and my sister being there is definitely a core memory. But you know what I don't have memory of?  Being put back in my own bed and learning to be ok. So clearly that didnt cause me trauma or damage. However you decide to handle your son's nightmares or resulting coping skills needs to be discussed and decided on WITH your husband. You are a team and assuming you share the common goal of raising your son to be happy confident adjusted human being, locking him out will only hinder that goal and put potential strain on your future relationship. I don't have an answer to what you should do, to each their own,  other than telling you locking him out of your bedroom and ignoring your scared child is not the answer.", "Nah. He is 4 and if he needs his parents then he needs his parents.", "NTA! Only humans think that letting the young ones sleep away from their parents/group is a good idea. Children no matter the  specie need the safety of their parents amw9round them, and it is deep in our DNA. While a 4 years old understands during the day that no saber-toothed tiger will snack him away, he won't be able to keep his instincts under control during the night. This will not magically disappear if you ignore his desire to be close to his loved ones. Kids whose parents closed the doors when they are scared don't become more brave, but more insecure (there are studies out there, especially about letting babies cry themselves into sleep. Don't do that!). A kid running to their parents at night doesn't need discipline but security.\n\nHowever, there are usually no dangers your kid needs protection for but you are in the very dangerous situation to not get a good sleep. One way to solve this is to find a ritual you do every night and to make your kid feels secured in his own room. More lights would be one way, or you \"order\" some monster repellent spray, a dreamcatcher for bad dreams (worked wonders with me) or anything else. Rituals you do every night also help. But it is also important that he always knows that if it fails, he can always come to you. Be there for him (either in his room or yours) and discuss the next day what you can change. Don't worry, your kid WILL grow out of it, and all kids have their own pace. Some kids never asked their parents to sleep in their bed while others are 8 and older when they finally stay in their own bed.", "My step father would do this when I was little. I'm an adult I still have night time anxiety. When I was younger it was worse than it is now.\n\nYou could always get a bigger bed for your son. (A queen bed) so you can lay down with him comfortably in his room. \n\nIt's being compromising because your son deserves to feel safe with the comfort of you being there.\n\nNta.", "NTA, at 4 nightmares are a thing increasingly and you want your kid to feel safe. Maybe him sleeping in the guest room until it gets better is an idea, but locking out a scared kid is not nice. It's stressful I get it, but having kids means getting through those phases...", "He is 4 not 40.", "I had the same experience. I just wanted comfort, I was so scared and wanted help and I got nothing. OP's child is 4, I don't understand why other commenters are acting like he's 30, why is it so awful to comfort a scared child?", "This, my daughter came and got in to bed with us often at night right up to about 9 or 10. My mum used to say its not for ever and she'll stop. And now my daughter is in full teenager strop mode I really miss those late night cuddles lol.", "Me being a whole grown ass woman still sleeping in bed with my mama. Lmao.", "When my kids had nightmares, I would go to their beds with them, until they fell asleep. I often fell asleep in their beds. \n\nI think the security is important, especially at such a young age. I don\u2019t think him sleeping in your bed is a bad thing, but as your husband doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s probably better if you go to your son\u2019s bed.  My husband didn\u2019t tolerate our children in our bed, which is why I went to their beds. When I was a child, my mother would tell us to go back to bed, but our father always stayed with us if we had bad dreams. \n\nWith time, this will stop. My children are now grown, and I look back at those times wistfully.", "Or just knock? That\u2019s what I remember doing at that age. I wasn\u2019t allowed to barge in.", "Jesus fuck I hope you never have children. The kid is FOUR YEARS OLD.", "He's four?!?! FFS", "Yeah, I had friends whose kid was too young to really speak or say that something was wrong. She was still smol. \nShe wandered into their room and woke them up by crawling into their bed, just burning up and sweating a river.\n\nShe\u2019s not a loud kid, wasn\u2019t a loud baby. If they had locked their door, she probably could\u2019ve just been there the entire night like that.\n\nHonestly, they could get a baby gate for their door if they\u2019re that desperate to not have him in their room. But yeah, the kid needs access to his caregivers somehow. At least until he\u2019s old enough to fully communicate.", "This.

My parents opted to get me my own little TV and it worked wonders.", "i think this person parents", "This is the perfect response to OP. One of the hardest things in early parenting is sleep schedules and, OP, if you don't nip this in the bud, you will be exhausted for years to come. Especially if you have another child someday.

I mentioned this to a nurse at my clinic recently. She said that she did the same thing with her son, and everyone warned her that she would still have a teenager sleeping in her bed.\u201d\n\nDespite the warning, the nurse attributes her close connection\u00a0with her now teenage son to those early days in\u00a0the rocker. \u201cA\u00a0few weeks ago, her teenage son came home from school very upset. He didn\u2019t want to talk, and just went to his room and listened to his music, typed on his phone and cried.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe mother gave her son space, and night time came and she went to bed. Just as she was about to turn off her side light, the door opened, and her 15-year-old son padded into the room. He climbed into the bed with her, laid his head on her shoulder and cried. He told her all about the girl that broke his heart, all about the friends who laughed, all about the stresses of being him.\u201d\n\nThey talked for hours in the dark, sharing their thoughts until they both fell asleep in the bed together, she explains. \u201cI was so scared that I would wind up with a teenager who would \u2018need me\u2019 at night, that I never stopped to consider how beautiful that would really be.\u201d", "I understand that, but not every child is the same, and parents need to sleep too, so if putting the child in the bed gives a little more sleep so be it.\n\nI do agree there needs to be something, a friend put a second bed in their kids room so when the kid did come in they just went and slept in the room with them, their partner was a shift worker, so I do understand that side of it, but locking a door is an absolute no in my house. And they feel safe enough to sleep in their beds, tell me when something is wrong, etc.", "Lol, right?

They are literally coming to you because you are safe and they need reassurance. \nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with letting a child sleep with you until they develop their independence. Independence whilst a child is young is not linear, they will go through phases of needing extra reassurance and other phases of feeling confident and independent. \nYour child will not still be sleeping in your bed at 18, they grow up and develop independence on their own at their own rate. \nThere is absolutely no NEED to force your child to be independent just because the western society has this strange fixation on it and it's somehow the current standard.", "Locking the door isn't going to accomplish anything because chances are very good that the child will start crying or knocking on the door and wake you up anyway.

If you wamt to comfort your son you should comfort and its okay even if he wanta to sleep with u because he is 4 and the world is scary .", "NTA\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine locking my child out when he is scared.\n\nIt\u2019s great that sometimes you will comfort and then take back, but it\u2019s also totally fine that you sometimes let him stay.\nI had this happen with both my children except it started around 3, and sometimes I was too exhausted from my day to do the comforting/settling and back to their bed, I\u2019m my sleepy mind I\u2019d just lift the blankets, let them climb in, hug them and go back to sleep.. my kids both sleep in their own rooms all the time now.\nMy husband would sometimes sleep in the guest room so myself and whichever child had come in would have more space and be comfortable.. and he didn\u2019t mind because our childrens comfort and feeling safe and happy is more important than him getting to sleep in our bed every night.\n\nSorry, this is rambling, but you\u2019re NTA, keep doing what you\u2019re doing, being a good mum. \n(The trying to make sure they find their room safe is also a good thing, but sometimes hugs with parents are what they need)", "Your husband does want to be tossed and turned on after being woken up. The kid should brought back every single time. The longer you jet this go on the worse it is going to get. Limit screen time and none 30 minutes before bed. Add string lights to his room. Come up with a plan WITH your husband for the best way to stop this behavior. He shouldn\u2019t be locking the door but you shouldn\u2019t be unilaterally I voting him in the bed. NAH", "Also intimacy doesn\u2019t only refer to sex. Emotional and physical intimacy of just sleeping together is hugely important", "It sounds like you both had policy. The issue here is that op and her husband don\u2019t have a policy. They need to get on the same page. For a lot of couples, having that private place to just be a couple is hugely important for emotional intimacy. It can kill a relationship if both are not in agreement. That is the issue here and why I voted ESH. They need to make a policy like you had. It doesn\u2019t matter too much what it is as long as both are on the same page. It seems here that the husband is not okay with the child sleep in the bed with them. That needs to be addressed and op saying well sleep somewhere else is childish and not constructive in a healthy relationship", "Me too.  My son always had access to our bed, and was fine sleeping alone.   Maybe 8 YRO kid needed to sleep with parents until that age.  Maybe SIL did something smart.  Every child is different with different needs,", "I know, if you see my follow up comment below. My original comment is just more of a warning of what could possibly happen down the road.", "And I remember a few months (weeks I don't know) when I got to sleep in my parent's bed.  It was delicious.  Then they told me it was enough, and it was.", "THat would be reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut she is still the AH for her shitty way of communicating and for her shitty approach to solving disagreements.", "Honestly, I've shared beds with grown men and a small child. I'd pick the small child every time \ud83d\ude02 their toes and elbows dig in a little, but their snoring is cute and not a freight train lol", "My husband said that my son and I would do ballet in our sleep, and both of us would stay fast asleep.", "Yup - \"self soothing\" literally isn't possible for a child this young, they don't have the brain development to reason out that their nightmare isn't real and they're actually safe.\n\nWhat they can learn is learned helplessness - that no one is going to help them because the parents don't think they need to parent overnight, so their only option is to suck it up and lie terrified in their bed or, in less common circumstances, feverish or covered in wee / vomit (happened to both my nephew and sister as kids because of parents who advocated asshole behaviour like \"cry it out\") until they pass out.\n\nObviously there is a middle way between co-sleeping and cry it out, but claiming kids can learn to self soothe this young is just not supported by our current knowledge of child development.", "My almost 3 year old sleeps with me, and apart from the occasional elbow in the face, I really like it. It's so nice to spend time winding down together at the end of the day, and he gets really chatty right before he falls asleep and tells me all sorts of stories.", "They're not well adjusted tbh, I wish they were. I do have a son, he's 8 - has ADHD and ASD level 2 and is far more adjusted than her three.", "I think they meant you as in \u201cyou, the parents\u201d not \u201cyou, the mother\u201d", "They will grow out of it even without redirection and comfort. My kids slept with me until they didn't want to anymore. Around 8 it started to drop off.", "Yeah, as I said I know what I'll need to do, I was just holding onto *some* hope that this issue will solve itself over time because I haven't slept decently since 2019 and I **do not** look forward to a long stretch of multiple sleepless nights in a row lol.", "Wait:  Mommy and Daddy can get comfort by sleeping with each other, but the child MUST sleep alone?  What makes you think that the child doesn't have lighting, bedding, sound machines, and all that? \n\nSome children just want their parent(s) for comfort.  It is not a failure of parenting that they seek parental company in the middle of the night.  It is normal and natural, especially if that parent is loving and nurturing during the day.  \n\nThe parents need to find a solution that works for all three of them.", "This is such a great answer. The other very serious concern about your response is that this is not an isolated issue. You two need to get together on how you will handle things right now. You two ALWAYS need to be on the same team. Your child will try to play one against the other if he thinks that he\u2019s likely to get his way. He will test boundaries\u2026 all of them. Nighttime is the hardest time to know your child is upset, particularly if you struggled with this as a child. But by dismissing your husband\u2019s concern, you\u2019re sending the clear message that while parenting, only your opinion matters and you won\u2019t support him when he makes decisions. That is not cool and will lead to much bigger issues in your relationship. No one likes being the heavy all the time. You need to take a step back and rethink your response and how this will play out if you don\u2019t get on the same page\u2026 because seeing it up as your husband against you is not healthy.", "Top comment right here folks ^", "  This is really helpful insight.", "I bet lots of small kids think that as well, but they're expected to sleep completely alone while the grown adults get company.", "Right sorry I forgot we don\u2019t parent four year olds. \n\nIf you let your 4 year old into your bed all night  every time he is scared then your child will learn to be \u201cscared\u201d in order you sleep in your bed.\n\nIt hilarious you\u2019d allow yourself to be manipulated by a 4 year old.", "Forgot you don\u2019t parent 4 year olds.", "Exactly, your kids should know that they can come to you when they are scared, you should be their safe space. When did comforting a small child become a harmful way to raise children?", "My husband finds seeing me care for our children to be quite attractive...  if cuddling a 4yo when they have a nightmare kills \"marital intimacy\" I'm really worried for OP, because something is wrong with her husband!", "That's exactly it, just enjoy the time the little ones like to spend their time with us. We'll become the embarrassing parents early enough, when they can't be seen together with us \ud83d\ude05", "I don't think you were whining.  And there is no \"one true solution.\"  \n\nMy youngest kept coming in our room.  My husband didn't want her to get used to sleeping in our bed.  We put an old crib mattress and a blanket on my side of the bed.  Our daughter would wander in and snuggle down on the mattress, and everyone was happy.  \n\nEventually she stopped.", "It won\u2019t. If you know what you need to do then do it. Don\u2019t whine about it not happening on its own. You need to parent your child even at night", "Username confirms.", "Cool and all the main issue here is that the parents aren\u2019t on the same page and that is why everyone sucks", "It's 647 in the morning where I live and I'm sitting in my room ugly crying bc I miss the times my now 7 year old (going on 16 most days) needs me less and less. If she came to me at night as an actual teen, I'd lose it lol. Then she'd think I'm hella weird but my god there's nothing like the feeling of when ur child COMES to u on their own when they aren't the needy toddlers anymore. It hits so much more different when they are older. It is too early to be ugly crying already!!!", "Your thought process is shockingly callous, I feel sorry for any child you \"parent\".\n\nAll of those malicious, manipulative toddlers running around, good thing you are here to give small children a what for and get them into shape.", "This is not true.  If you comfort a 4 year old when they are scared they learn they are safe, then start to sleep through the night again.  If you deny them they remember this and feel the pain their entire lives.  \n\nJust like when a child falls you pick them up and kiss them.  this does not mean they fall all the time for the kisses.", "He wants to lock his scared 4 year old out of their room. \n\nSomething is DEFINITELY wrong with her husband", "I wasn't whining, I was asking actually. I will start whining when it's time to do this shit. I'm still enjoying the cuddles for now. Day or night, I try to limit my parenting to the minimum, it makes me tired and sometimes cranky so I'd rather not. Thanks for the advice though, super insightful lol.", "I\u2019ve seen a 5 year old threatening to squeeze a hamster and also throw herself off a high step to get what she wants. If you think a 4 year old is incapable of manipulating you that is really just proving my point. Good luck to your bratty kids who get what they want because mommy feels sorry for them and doesn\u2019t know how to say no. \n\nIt is not cold to teach your child they need to sleep in their own bed. Every child wants to sleep with mom and dad it\u2019s only the shitty parents that are unable to train their child out of it.", "If you kiss a child when they fall because they cry, they learn to cry every time they fall regardless of if they are hurt or not. Yes it is exactly like that it\u2019s called Molly coddling good luck with your parenting and raising children who struggle with independence and confidence.\n\nBet you feed your cat every time it jumps on the bench because that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s hungry \ud83d\ude02", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
