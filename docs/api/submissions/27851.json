She approached things WAY wrong...HOWEVER, things like Stevia are not much more than sugar nowadays and are very easy to work with and could actually be healthier for everyone and tend not to make much difference in taste. I know its not up to you to accommodate one person but its not a huge shift. Personally I have celiac and HAVE to eat gluten free and while I will often eat before I go or bring something, sometimes it feels bad to walk into something at work and not be able to eat anything or just a few things because no one thinks of you. I dont expect them to but when I went to a cousins birthday party and expected to just eat a plate of chips because they were doing pizza and she brought out a gluten free pizza she had ordered along with the regular pizzas, it made me feel good. She was definitely an a-hole if she came at you that hard. Had she approached you and asked if you had ever made Sugar Free desserts because she knew everyone loved your stuff but she could never try it and maybe even offered to buy ingredients if you would be willing to make something, since you said you do like to bake, I think it would have gone much further and you would have likely been more willing to try doing SF next time.

Sure it might be nice if you tried but you don't have too. \n\n. I love baking and would gladly try to bake something vegan for part of my family but it takes a lot of time and research and sometimes I just don't feel like it\nFinding sugar free dessert (good) recipes is hard\n\nYour coworker should know the world doesn't revolve around her.. and it was quite selfish of her to ask you this and in an angry tone", "NTA\n\nYou make treats for your coworkers. They can accept or decline. You shouldn't have to alter your recipe to make anyone else happy. Short of your employer asking you not to make treats with items that people are allergic to, I don't see an issue here. \n\nIf anyone here is selfish, it's the coworker thinking everyone should be required to have desserts catered to her...

Ceasing to do something and then turning the entire office against one person is not the way to handle it.

Though I just made a batch of cherry walnut chocolate chip banana bread that was sugar free technically, because wow you don\u2019t need extra sugar with very ripe bananas. Highly recommend as a fun recipe activity because you just make a banana bread vase and add whatever the hell you want that won\u2019t mess up the moisture levels.

Because there were 2 classmates that had lactose intolerance and or gluten allergies. They really appreciated it because they could only eat the food they brought themselves, and they loved my fruit coctail bowls.\nIt is good to be aware of these things.\n\nBut also diabetic or not, if you eat something unhealthy the sugars aren't the only villains. If your colleague wants Your baked goods, she will have to think about, \"if I want something unhealthy, I will have to lose double the calories for it.\" It will be a reward then to eat less healthier foods.\nIf she also doesn't say \"I am diabetic\" all the time and instead starting to do something about it, it wouldn't be a burden anymore.\n\nThis is just my opinion.", "Can't you make something gawdawful? Make a huge deal about her being special and all, but make sure she eats her entire portion as you had to drive all over tarnation to get the special ingredients. The high cost of special Ingredients. The high cost of gas. The hours searching for a sugar free recipe. And then she doesn't like it?", "NTA. That being said, have you tried using Splenda? It's good for diabetics and it tastes exactly like sugar without the funky aftertaste you get with Equal or Sweet & Low, so she can eat and so can everyone else. Obviously I'm not saying you *have* to do this, because she was an AH for how she approached you for consideration, just throwing it out as a suggestion", "As a diabetic myself: NTA\n\nIf someone at work brings something I can't eat, I dont eat it. Period.\n\nOf course she can REQUEST that you do something that she can eat too, but she has to accept a firm NO, too.", "With the way the world is today I would stop making them altogether for fear of \"singling out\" someone.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to make a separate dessert for one singular sugar free person. If there were multiple people with sugar free diets, It would be a different story.

Don't stop making the snacks because she's got diabetes instead make more of the snacks and maybe her diabetes problem will solve itself.", "Nta. Reminds me of one of my old coworkers. I made smores squares for a work potluck. And while we were all sitting around eating someone commented that they really liked my squares. This coworker said that they would have liked more chocolate in them. So I replied \"well, when YOU make something, YOU can put in as much chocolate as you want\". In the 3+ years she worked with us she NEVER brought anything to the potlucks. Not once! The nerve of some people.", "NTA. You're generous to make desserts for anyone. Just like you avoid spicy foods, your diabetic coworker needs to avoid sweets. You have no responsibility for her diet.\n\nHer request (demand?) is ridiculous.", "I can't have caffeine... meaning I don't eat chocolate at all. Do you know how many times I have been unable to participate in eating a dessert someone brought in? I don't feel bad unless they make a deal about it. (Many people will get really apologetic and make it uncomfortable for me. Like I get it, but it's not a big deal. It's not like the cookies were for my birthday or something). \n\nYou have no obligation to make a sugar-free dessert for one person. If you brought a death by chocolate cake in for her birthday... that would be a different story. But NTA.", "NTA - stop baking.  Then tell everyone who asks \"I love to bake but coworker asked me not to bake any more because it's selfish unless I can make the desserts sugar free.  That's not something I know how do and I don't want her to feel left out, so I stopped making the desserts at her request.\"  Let the chips fall where they may.", "NTA - people are entitled", "NTA\n\nI have coeliacs disease and I wouldn\u2019t dream of asking you, or anyone else to make me something gluten free!  I\u2019d just provide my own!\n\nI did, however, once work with someone who converted to baking gf if they were taking anything into work, because they wanted to include me, I\u2019ve never felt so blessed!

Does she ever contribute?", "NTA no one can expect every dish at a work potluck to cater to them personally. I have a million digestive issues and know what I do about work potlucks? I just don't partake. If someone ever says anything, I explain about my medical condition. Yeah sometimes it isn't nice to feel left out, but being a loud entitled asshole isn't the answer.", "NTA. You're not obligated to bake something specific for just one person. That's not the point of a potluck lol.\n\nHowever, a strategy you may consider would be to contact the potluck organizers and say - \"Hey, so-and-so recently mentioned to me that there are no sugar-free desserts. That's a new category for me and not something I'm comfortable baking for so many people, but I was wondering if there was any room in the party budget to purchase a small tray of sugar-free cookies or brownies to accommodate those who may want them?\" If you're feeling especially generous you could offer to chip in a little. \n\nI imagine it might be frustrating to feel left out when everyone else gets to enjoy a delicious dessert. I don't know your relationship with said coworker, but a small gesture to help accommodate her might go a long way.", "NTA why doesn\u2019t SHE bring sugar free desserts??", "Nta that's not your problem", "NTA she can bring her own or give you the stuff, and you could bake it.   Not everybody likes sugar-free, so you would be baking for one person!!!!", "NTA", "NTA - You are not required to make desserts and you are DEFINITELY not required to cater to her wants.", "I used to bring pizza as a reward for my team.

I thought I had been poisoned! Bring your treats, and they can eat or not.\nNTA", "NTA. If she were a guest in my home, I would make the effort to accommodate her, but not in an office setting where everyone is bringing in something. It is up to her to provide for her own needs if she cannot eat what others bring in. She is the selfish one.", "Yeah NTA. I have type one diabetes and I would never demand this of anyone. If there's something I can't eat I just won't eat it. At potlucks there's usually lots of options I can have instead and if I really wanted to I could bring my own sugar free stuff.", "NTA.

You shouldn't have to be responsible for your co-worker's diet.  If she can't eat sugar, she can't eat sugar.

Xylitol icing sugar is also kind of a disaster - a Swiss meringue is the best option, partially because the butter prevents it from collapsing."]}
