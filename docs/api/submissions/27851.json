Artificial sweeteners taste gross, don't ruin your desserts with them. I would be petty and bring a store bought bowl of fruit for her next time.", "NTA you make it how you want to. The only reasons to make a sugar free dessert for something like this is because the majority of people there need a sugar free dessert or you want to make one", "NTA\n\n Any sensitivities that she has are her burden to bear. Honestly, her approach was so entitled that I would be disinclined to do her any favors at all.", "NTA - Your coworker is entitled to bake and bring in sugar free deserts for everyone if she so chooses.", "NTA but also I'm married to a diabetic and if you want to address her \"complaints\" without engaging in extra work sugar free Jello.\n\nShe needs 0 carb if she's diabetic not just sugar free so a jello bowl costs about 60 to 70 c for a store brand.", "NTA\u2014she is .What a Drama Queen !", "I\u2019m a Type1 diabetic.

If she's that much of a sweet tooth, she can bring her own, or have a meal without. \n\nAt our monthly lunches I was told if something had  my allergy in it and didnt eat it. All good.  Certainly never told them not to cook it.", "NTA good for you for instantly shutting her down. This lady is unhinged. Bring her a pack of sugar free gum, she can chew on that while everyone else enjoys your stuff lol", "Next time bring her a big bag of sugar free gummy bears. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading the reviews on Amazon, take  a moment. Very informative.", "NTA. She approached things WAY wrong...HOWEVER, things like Stevia are not much more than sugar nowadays and are very easy to work with and could actually be healthier for everyone and tend not to make much difference in taste. I know its not up to you to accommodate one person but its not a huge shift. Personally I have celiac and HAVE to eat gluten free and while I will often eat before I go or bring something, sometimes it feels bad to walk into something at work and not be able to eat anything or just a few things because no one thinks of you. I dont expect them to but when I went to a cousins birthday party and expected to just eat a plate of chips because they were doing pizza and she brought out a gluten free pizza she had ordered along with the regular pizzas, it made me feel good. She was definitely an a-hole if she came at you that hard. Had she approached you and asked if you had ever made Sugar Free desserts because she knew everyone loved your stuff but she could never try it and maybe even offered to buy ingredients if you would be willing to make something, since you said you do like to bake, I think it would have gone much further and you would have likely been more willing to try doing SF next time. For instance I am a good cook/baker and have been approached to do SF desserts for our family dinners but they approached me nicely about it, didn't demand it, and bought the sweetener for me to use.", "NTA. Sugar free desserts use alternative sugars, which are expensive. She's trying to get you to make her a batch of desserts to take home. Don't do it.\n\nThere are several sugar products that would work. I frequently see recipes that use multiples. She's quite demanding to think that you should cater to her. She should absolutely bring her own.", "She shouldn't eat dessert if she's diabetic. That's what most diabetics do!", "NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They can accept or decline. You shouldn't have to alter your recipe to make anyone else happy. Short of your employer asking you not to make treats with items that people are allergic to, I don't see an issue here. \n\nIf anyone here is selfish, it's the coworker thinking everyone should be required to have desserts catered to her...

I only eat stuff I bring \ud83e\udd23 I usually end up eating veggies sticks or crackers but that's okay it's my choice", "I saw a neighbor once out a frying pan on the stove that  her cat had been lying  in She offered to have me stay for supper .No thanks .Gag !", "Good lord, this is horrible advice. Ceasing to do something and then turning the entire office against one person is not the way to handle it. That is how you create a hostile work environment and get yourself fired.\n\nOP is NTA for sure. There are better ways to handle this, like what OP already did. Tell them that's not going to happen and suggest they bring their own desserts that meet their dietary needs.", "The ironic part is the selfish person accusing someone else of being selfish.", "That's the devils product!
