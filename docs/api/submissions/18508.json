My mom kept both of our hair in its natural state when we were young; I continued this when I got old enough to do my own hair but since she was 14, Clara wanted to experiment with colors, textures, cuts, etc. She's had a lot of really cool styles over the years but her hair has definitely been damaged from it.\n\nPeople often comment on my hair because it's really long at this point and if my sister is present, she'll usually say something like \"OP got all the good hair genes\". She'll complain to me in private that it's \"unfair\" that my hair still curls up nicely and \"she wishes she could get her hair to do that\" \n\nIt didn't used to bother me but she says it so often now and I'm so sick of hearing it. It's not genes. It's not luck. If you wanna bleach your hair every time you see a root and raw dog it with a straightener every day, then that's your business and you're free to do it but it's not some mystery that your hair isn't in peak condition afterwards. just bffr. please. we have the same hair. It's just frustrating when she plays dumb about it.\n\nOur cousin had a BBQ this weekend and my sister and I both went.

Yes you could've made it into a joke like, *guess that's the tax for awesome pink hair*, which would've been the best approach for everyone there (including the now awkward feeling bystanders), but sometimes things come to a point where a more direct approach is needed. Now, to your cousin and the other attendees of the BBQ, you might be an asshole in allowing your sibling issues to cast a shadow over what was supposed to be a fun event. But that wasn't your question, so no, you weren't an asshole in this instance to your sister. She should've heard you when it was brought up multiple times to her.", "NTA. It\u2019s not even about what she\u2019s done to destroy her hair. She shouldn\u2019t interject with self-depreciating comments when someone is trying to give you a compliment. She wanted some attention too and you gave it to her.", "I have a friend who always comments on how \u201clucky\u201d I am to have the glorious head of hair that I do have. When in reality it took a lot of work; I used to be like your sister and bleach, straighten, damage my hair constantly. And it got super fried and super short, so about 8 years ago I changed my ways and worked on getting my mane healthy. I don\u2019t think there are any AHs in your story but I just wanted to share that I relate to being annoyed at comments like that. Don\u2019t let it eat away at you and damage your relationships though! You\u2019ve already got the prettier hair ;) lol", "Ok, try a different approach. Next time somebody  compliments your hair and your sister pipes up with the oh, woe is me, OP is sooo lucky she got the good  hair\u2026  Smile and  say yes, you *are* very fortunate. Too bad you got the short end of the stick, sis. Try to sound sympathetic. After all, you are agreeing with her. \n\nAnd if she complains in private, tell her you know, (she has bad hair), shrug and say well, that sucks for her. \n\nNTA she just wants attention. You don\u2019t have to give it to her, to your own detriment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
