I also highly advise you to stick to your guns on this one.  \n\nI restore and use Singer sewing machines, everything from modern ones, to vintage ones with a potted motor, to antique ones that run on a treadle.  Yes, there are differences in machines, especially in regards to acceptable usage.   I can and have run saddle leather through my treadle machine (circa 1920s) and have sewn corsets with up to 7 layers of fabric on my potted motor machine (1950s).  I've also done heavy-duty sewing on a 1980s-era Necchi machine.  Would I do any of that on a new sewing machine?  Heck no!  (hisses vehemently)\n\nThe difference between modern sewing machines and vintage/antique ones is all about what is inside.  When I crack open the treadle machine or the vintage one, I know that there is not going to be a single piece of plastic in the 'innards'.  Everything is either cast or machined metal, which makes it extremely durable and enables it to stand up to punishing material thicknesses.  It also contributes significantly to their longevity.  The treadle machine I have now came to me in non-working order.  I was able to dismantle it, ultrasonic/clean all the parts, find and replace a sheared needle bar, relubricate, and reassemble the machine.  I used a standard leather treadle belt, which I purchased from Amazon.  What I got in the end was a machine that sews through the heaviest materials I can run through it, even though it's over 100 years old.  I might have a needle get dull and break, but that's the extent of my issues with that particular machine.  \n\nNew machines, which are more often than not made in China, have significant deficiencies in regards to their construction, design, and motor power.  If you open one up, you'll see something scary to anyone who does more than hobbyist sewing:  plastic parts.  If the bars and pins are not plastic, the gears almost certainly are.  I was given a Singer Simple by a friend, and to my horror, quickly discovered that 4 layers of silk (lightweight but denire-thick) were too heavy for it to handle.  What was it doing?  Welp, it would make a tic-tic-tic sound, indicating that at least one of the gears was very quickly being stripped, and the needle would stick in the fabric and refuse to go down or rise.  It took me all of three weeks to kill that poor machine, simply because the things I sew most often are items which are made to last...It was a pity that the machine was not up to the task.  And even though my Necchi machine is considered vintage, it still has some plastic parts, in particular gears, that I have to consider when sewing items.\n\nUnless your new machine is labeled/rated as a \"heavy duty\" or an industrial machine (more durable parts and stronger motor than regular machines), DO NOT allow anyone to sew heavier items or leather on it.  You'll end up with broken parts, in particular the gears, or bent parts on your machine, as they are not designed to sew through anything thicker than 3 layers of canvas or so.  Leather is also a huge no-no.  Attempting to sew those things will result in broken/bent parts, stripped gears, and/or a burnt motor, and it will happen within a short timeframe.  Your mom is basically demanding that you allow her to ruin your machine before you've even had a chance to get the new smell out of it.\n\nWhat really concerns me here is that your mom does not have the money to replace her current machine, and she has to scrape together and borrow to buy a replacement.  If she messes up your new machine, how will she reimburse you for the damage?  For that matter, would she reimburse you for the usage?  If she has all these orders to complete, then her business is obviously has a clientele.  Why has she not put aside money in case of equipment failure, refunds, materials, etc.?  Even cottage industries such as hers does such a thing.  \n\nThis squarely falls on your mother for not responsibly running her little business as a business.  She's looking for the cheapest way (for her, not you) to do her projects, and she either does not care about or is intentionally and maliciously ignoring the fact that your brand-new machine can't take the kind of abuse she's going to put it through.  It's not your fault that she did not plan for the eventuality of her machine breaking (on sewing machines, even older ones, it's a matter of \"when it breaks\" and not \"if it breaks\").  And you are not responsible for any mechanical failures she encounters on her machine.  Your machine is not built to take on her type of sewing, and its both selfish and foolhardy for your mom to even ask.  If she's an accomplished sewer, she knows already that she's going to either damage or ruin that weaker machine on those types of items, and she already knows that if she messes up your machine, she doesn't have the ability to have it professionally repaired or replaced.  It also sounds like she knows that if she does mess up your new machine, you won't be too forceful about her repairing/replacing it, because you live with her.  She's thinking that she'll use your machine, and (in her mind) odds are that no damage will occur.  For her, it's a win/win:  project gets done on time, no money out of her pocket to replace her machine, and (assuming here) she keeps all the money from the project that your machine labors to complete.  But from the perspective of someone who has done what she is about to do, and from someone who has the ability to repair machines, I can say that she is dead wrong, and you are the person who will end up losing, probably both in money and in equipment.\n\nTell your mom what I have told you here, and offer to help her pay for repairs on hers, but that your machine has plastic parts and cannot handle at all the type of sewing she does.  It will not \"make it through\" even one project before damage occurs, and you already know your mom cannot afford to repair or replace your machine and hers, too.

The tools needed are very basic ones that are inexpensive to buy, and which your home probably already has:  Philips and flathead screwdrivers, sewing machine oil, degreaser, Q-Tips, old artist's paintbrushes or makeup brushes, old rags, canned air, vacuum cleaner with a fine tip wand, and perhaps a magic eraser.  I have more specialized tools that I also use, such as an ultrasonic cleaner, a steam cleaner, WD-40 (for stubborn/rusted bolts, never use for lubrication!), and a Dremel with attachments to remove rust, dried oil, and other crud.\n\nIf you google search the type of machine and common problems, chances are you'll hit upon what's messing up her machine and find a solution.  If she can't afford to be without a machine and also can't afford a repairman, her next best bet is to figure out how to do the repairs herself.  It's not that hard to do.  Since your stepdad appears to be so concerned, I'd suggest he makes himself useful in this scenario and learn those skills.\n\nConsidering that your mom has already sent one of your machines to the Great Sewing Room in the Sky, and now has another defunct machine...Your mom's history tells you what you can expect for your new machine.  Even if your new machine manages to struggle and sputter its way through a few projects, I guarantee that the heavy demands will cause damage and drastically shorten the life of your machine before the first project is even complete.  Things like gears don't strip all at once, and belts don't fail unexpectedly:  it's wear-and-tear that occurs over time, even when only used lightly.  Heavier materials are going to speed up the process.  And if she's not doing basic maintenance like cleaning out lint in the bobbin/feeddogs area and oiling her machine on a regular basis, then the lifespan of the machine will be further reduced.  You can't habitually abuse a sewing machine, then expect it to just keep working.  They're not made to be durable anymore, even if used solely for what's considered to be regular hobbyist usage.  \n\nAnd if she's that desperate for a machine, working ones in good condition can be found very cheaply on Marketplace.  Considering how your mom burns through them, she might be better off spending less money on a used replacement/backup unit, and honestly, an older machine might just stand up better to heavier usage.  The older ones are also much easier to work on than machines with electronics on them.\n\nBottom line here is that you are under no obligation to take what you enjoy and hand it over just because your mom is in a bind.  If she can learn to sew leather and foam, then she can also learn how to repair her own machine.  (Side note:  I'd gargle with sewing machine oil before I'd ask one of my adult kids for anything.)\n\nIt might work out better for you to take your new machine back to the store, get a refund, and then wait until your mother fixes her problem before you bring a machine of your own into the house.  She's using you as a cheap solution to her problem, and you're not going to get anything out of it except a busted-up new machine and building resentment.", "NTA, as I have said elsewhere, but you may have to step away from this for awhile. Let your stepdad and mom figure it out.", "Then she can now learn to use her hands.\n\nWould be way better than using a newer machine or non-heavy-duty machine anyway!", "Yup. I have my great-aunt's sewing machine she bought off the high school she worked at...mofo was built no later than the 60s and you will pry it from my cold dead hands...it handles things no modern machine would be able to stand up too, but I'm also not nutty enough to try leathers or anything...", "Some people are just like this, they just feel that if they keep their head down and keep working, all will be well. You obviously love your mother and wish you could help, so it is hard to sit by while she keeps doing this, but none of this is your fault.", "NTA.  If they break your machine, they will not replace it.  Let Stepdad go get her a new machine or pay for repairs.  None of this is your problem.", "NTA. I just sold a small pet product business and I had an industrial fabricator.  You can get them used for about $400.00 she needs to save up. And either adjust her pricing so she is profitible and can buy a machine a d actually make money or call it quits. The IRS will at some point consider it a hobby if she doesn't turn a profit. My smaller machine I used for product tags etc but I had to pierce layers of foam fabric and velcro and there is no way the smaller machine could handle it.", "NTA, your not obligated to give her a tool for her business. It sounds like poor planning on her part is hurting her now. If your machine is not meant to sew over/through the types of fabrics she is using than you should not Liam it out! I see and the one time  let someone use my machine is the one time it broke. The repair was $250, my friend that borrowed the machine did not offer to compensate for even $1 of the repair cost. \n\nI never loan my machine out again!", "She has a sewing business and only one machine (that isn't even built for the work she needs to do)??? If she really expects to be able to make a living from this she needs a much better plan. NTA", "Well, her business isn't profitable and your sewing machine isn't right for the job anyway. Problem solved.", "No, NTA. Your newly purchased machine won't stand up to what she wants to sew. It'll break, too. I would never lend something that I had saved up for but never used yet to someone else! It's too bad but it won't work.", "Am I the only one who thinks YTA \ud83e\udd14 \n\nThe reason I say so is because it is just a sewing machine. It is not the end of the world if you give it to your mother (the person who supposedly raised you) to support her business. I find it quite odd that you would choose a machine over your mother's welfare. Surely your mother is more important than an electrical product? You said that you don't think it is fair because you spent money etc, but I am sure your mother has spent a lot of money in order to raise you? Am I wrong ?\n\nI disagree with everyone who says NTA. Sorry.", ">my machine is absolutely not designed to sew through sponge, leather and thick materials. \n\nThis to me is the clincher, as it means that in a few weeks both of you will be needing a new machine. NTA.", "NTA and you need to point out to your mom and step-dad that your machine CAN\"T HANDLE those materials.\n\nI'm a sewer, and unless you either buy a very expensive machine or one labeled \"Heavy Duty\" your machine, and definitely your needles, will break.\n\nMom can go out and guy a Singer \"Heavy Duty\" sewing machine for around $200.", "Nta", "I've been making leather costumes and such professionally for over 15 years now. You can't do it on small machines. You HAVE to get an industrial. And I get how hard it is as a small business, I went through several used machines until I was finally able to get my 1st new industrial. It was worth every penny, catapulted us higher, quadrupled our sales. I know a great place to get one from too in Nashville, TN, they are bringing my new one next week. In the long run, better to spend the money for a proper machine. NTA.", "I loved your reply.  I bought a new sewing machine during Covid, and it took 3 months for it to come in.  There was a world side sewing machine shortage then.\n\nDuring the lockdown, I spent a LOT of time researching and reading sewing machine reviews and even watching YouTube videos..  I ended up with a Babylock Brilliant machine, and I love it.  \n\nA really good, heavy duty sewing machine brand is Juki.  I considered that but found the Babylock a little more my style.", "I have a Singer 301 A, which I love.", "It's the handyman special where it's just get it done.  That's how you end up with flex piping in plumbing and cardboard backing your drywall.\n\nSame mentality with using the wrong tool that mostly works but its gonna break", "Weeelllll, I have sewn often for about 3-4 decades. I agree that most machines cannot handle just any o'l fabric/project, but I have 3 steel Singer machines (my favorite is a 1940's model) that can really sew almost anything: leather, burlap, cotten or even silk or chiffon. It really is determined by having the right sized needles and approriate weight thread.\n\nOnce I was snowed in during a storm and had to sew ballet costumes for high-school aged kids. My newer plastic sewing machine broke down so I sewed those costumes on a really, really old, well-oiled Singer.  Everything came out fine. Thank heavens for the appropriate oil, needles and thread.  \n\nI would only give my Singers to my most favorite and trusted people.\n\nEXCEPTION: I have to have a newer (plastic) machine to do buttonholes :-(", "Yeah at times I feel like one cause I guess im just caught up in how its brand new and I feel like I worked hard to get it. At a level I think if her machine broke after I had mine for a couple of weeks I'd probably feel different and not even have been reluctant...", "NTA but can you rent her a professional machine for a few days? Depending where you live there are rental places.", "This was great information!  My go to, and only machine, is a 50 year old Pfaff 1222.  Virtually bulletproof!", "Those old machines are indestructible compared to the new ones. I\u2019ve got a few machines ranging from an old singer treadle machine, my grandmas machine from the 40s, and a \u201cnew\u201d one that\u2019s about 6 years old. \nAnything tough I use the treadle machine - it\u2019s easy to control the speed of the needle and pressure. \nMy new machine I\u2019ve snapped needles and the pressure feet.", "I understand that you wanted to use it yourself. But I really think you need to look at the bigger picture and do what's right. Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made for the greater good, and this is a small sacrifice indeed. I think you should give it her and be more supportive. Put yourself in her shoes, she raised someone all her life and you aren't doing this small favour? Just give it her.", "Excellent idea! Just give whatever she buys/gets a thorough cleaning and oil it occasionally.", "And Craigslist, eBay, and Etsy. The singer website has two heavy duty ,machines for < 200 right now.", "I had a Kenmore sewing machine, and decided to get a new Singer machine.  I used the Singer once and returned it. The Singer was too plastic. It couldn't compare with the Kenmore.  I found out that Kenmore sewing machines were actually made by Janome, and Janome machines are superior to Singer.", "Perhaps this was the push I needed and actually came here for. Thank you", "Remember, just because we have feelings doesn't mean we need to listen to them, sometimes the act of going against our emotions and doing what's right  is a show of true strength and character.\n\nI don't know you personally but I am genuinely very proud of you. You have shown a lot of strength here to go against your wishes. This is what it means to be a strong and compassionate human being. Super Super proud of you!!! Much love \u2764\ufe0f"]}
