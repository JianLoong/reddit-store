Obviously I immediately started sewing on it. As I was doing this however my mother who has a creative business was busy sewing on her machine too. She sews incredibly difficult to sew items and her machine broke. \n\nShe doesn't have a backup machine and has a lot of work due. Obviously the first thought is borrowing mine since she doesn't have funds to buy a new one. The trouble is my machine is absolutely not designed to sew through sponge, leather and thick materials. I really want to help her but I just feel like its very unfair to ask me to use mine since its brand new and I've gotten no use out of it. I also feel like I won't get it back in one piece or get it back the same at all. I just feel very anxious about saying no so I've avoided the issue while trying to instead help her get the funds together to buy a new one. I'd only be able to pay for one next week though which she says is too late...\n\nMy stepdad has gathered that I don't want to give my machine and thinks I am an AH for it. I certainly feel like one cause I really want to help but I also feel incredibly sad about giving away something I just got. So am I the asshole for not wanting to give her my brand new machine?\n\nEdit:\nHer business isn't really profitable and she does live from one order to the next. Sadly she doesn't want my help managing or handling her finances better, even though I'm a business consultant and have two relatively successful businesses of my own granted they're still new businesses so I'm not well off at all yet.  \n\nAlso we contintually have argued about her not taking on projects where she sews thick materials since she cannot afford an industrial machine. But she accepts those orders anyways. Her main products are supposed to be kids clothing which is fine on a domestic its the elaborate outfits, props etc that are the issue. Its fast money in her mind thought.

When I used to groom dogs I would have three clippers in case one of them broke while grooming. \n\nYou are not responsible for your mothers business and whether it rises or falls but this could have detrimental effects on your relationship. Is the sewing machine worth it? \n\nI know sewing machines are not cheap as I am currently saving for one but could you not stipulate to your mother that if she borrows yours and it comes back in anything less than pristine condition she is to buy you a new one. Failure to do so will mean you will not help her out in the future until money is given that would cover what you needed for a new machine. \n\nI mean if she doesn\u2019t have profits to buy a new machine where the hell are the profits from her business going ? \n\nSo you\u2019re NTA if you choose not to give her your machine but how negatively will this effect your relationship ?", "Can't you just explain that your machine is not heavy duty and therefore won't sew through the materials your mum uses. If she's a seamstress she would already know that so makes me wonder if this post is genuine.", "NTA - you saved up to buy it. Your mother has broken hers and can\u2019t afford to replace it. If she broke yours she wouldn\u2019t be able to replace it. Maybe she\u2019s in a tough spot but it\u2019s not fair of her to expect that of you.", "NTA, if the project broke her machine then it will likely do the same and then your mum has 2 broken machines that she can\u2019t afford to replace, instead of just one", "NTA, if your machine is not heavy duty then it's not. If your mother is an experienced seamstress, she should understand it. In some countries, there are like libraries where one car borrow different appliances/machines. Maybe she could look for it? Or, you know, look for possibilities of fixing her old machine. It's incredibly hard to permanently break a sewing machine.", "This seems fake. As someone who does sew a lot - it\u2019s pretty basic that a general machine won\u2019t cut it for thick materials (sadly I learned that lesson the hard way). Your mum should know better. \n\nAs someone who makes clothes as a hobby, I\u2019ve definitely given harder materials a red hot go, but it\u2019s failed every time. \n\nYour mum should know better.

It would be one thing if your machine could do the things she needs to do, but it sounds like she doesn't have access to a machine that can do what she needs, so she should go buy a new one. You should explain to your step father that your machine simply isn't heavy duty enough and in sewing machines thats actually a big deal and the machine *will* break if she tries to use it.", "NTA. Of course you don't want to give her your brand new machine that isn't even fit for her purposes. She must be a bad business woman since her efforts will not allow her to buy the necessary tool. She should stop her business immediately.", "If she needs an industrial machine she will just break yours then no one will have a machine.

If that's what she's sewing, your machine wouldn't cut it anyway, so this seems like a silly argument about who the AH is. \n\nNTA.", "I know how sensitive sewing machines are. Box it up, hide it.\n\nNo!\n\nMom needs to take care of herself.", "NTA - she broke her machine using it improperly to do projects it is not designed to cope with so now she wants to have yours to use in exactly the same way. Ridiculous! She needs an industrial machine not a domestic. You are not required to fund her idiocy with your money/things/time/effort or anything else.", "NTA smaller cheaper machines like yours are not designed for that kind of thing. She knows this as well. But instead of buying a new machine I would recommend taking it to a shop and seeing if they can repair it. That would be much cheaper.", "NTA. This is hard because it\u2019s your mom, and I imagine you feel some sort of obligation to give it to her because she\u2019s your mom But, you\u2019re both adults now, who have made adult decisions to put themselves in the positions that you\u2019re in. She likely knows you feel this small sense of obligation and seems like she\u2019s taking advantage of it. But it\u2019s your machine, your money, your sense in knowing this machine you love with break in your mothers care.", "If your mother's business can't afford the proper machinery for the job, it is going to fail. That is a fact. You letting her destroy your new machine will only postpone that a little bit, as once she does that there is still no backup machine. NTA.", "NTA dont let her near your sewing machine and maybe just let her run her business and stay out of it and let your stepfather handle it. he wont like it because she is rocking the boat and he has to rock back harder to stabilise the boat if you wont help but its not on you to enable her bad habits and he needs to realise she is the one causing the stress not you. if he continues to push you may have to sit down and explain your reasoning so he understands all that would happen is there would be 2 broken sewing machines.", "NTA.\n\nYour machine is new. It\u2019s not designed for the kind of work she does. You are helping by providing funds for her to get a new one.\n\nYour mom needs to run her business better. She needs to buy a specialized machine. She needs to set aside a little percentage from every job for equipment repair and replacement. She needs to let her current customers know there will be delays so they can take their work elsewhere to get it done in time if it\u2019s related to a specific event/deadline.", "NTA. You're right, most home use machines aren't equipped to handle heavy duty fabrics. Your mother will just havevto turn down the order until she has the money to repair or replace hers, or borrow from someone else. Don't let her guilt you into giving up yours.", "NTA- things like sponge and leather would definitely break your machine sooner.", "NTA.\n\nIf your mother really knows what she's doing, she would know that your machine won't do her any good. Your stepfather can be forgiven for not knowing the difference between sewing machines, but not for calling you an AH. Why isn't he buying a new machine?", "If you got 2 successful businesses buy your mom a new machine. I'm assuming you live together and she is using her business to put a roof over your head.", "NTA hide the machine and tell her it broke and is being repaired by the manufacturer which can take up to 30 days. Assuming you want to avoid drama.", "NTA. It would be pointless anyway, as your mother would break your machine the same way she broke hers. Tell your stepdad to step up and help get your mother a second hand industrial-level sewing machine so she doesn't continually have the same problem. Your mother is caught up in the \"if I just take on more work it will be fine\" mode of business equating being busy with success\u2014until she steps back and thinks about what she is doing it will be like this for her, and you sacrificing your brand new sewing machine won't help.
