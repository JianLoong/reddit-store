Any attempt to reach out is usually just to gloss over the past for the sake of keeping appearances.

The whole frog riding the scorpion story. She was a single mom looking for a provider and my con of a dad is all smiles and charm but a bleeding account full of draft fees. She jumped ship as any other reasonable woman would - but not after poisoning him to prioritize her and her kids over us for 2 years. I jumped that ship halfway once college had a on campus residence opening when I realized I\u2019d assume the scapegoat role. \n\nI can\u2019t extend him the same courtesy because he made that choice to go back on his word. He broke a promise to his own kids to treat us fairly and destroyed whatever progress he had with our mother because his then partner was jealous he was on somewhat civil terms with her, and jealously coaxed her to make an ultimatum. He made his choice and he burned those bridges. Shame, really. \n\nJokes on her - he emotionally cheated and then ultimately moved in her replacement and now theirs playing house with the baby and her pre-existing kids. Yikes. \n\nI\u2019m not gloating out of pettiness. I\u2019m just glad at least one woman had sense. She caught on sooner than my poor mother who was stuck with his shenanigans and two kids. \n\nPraying for the other because that\u2019s going to be a hard lesson to learn. Mom went through all sorts of abuse for a decade - and dealt with divorce for half of span of her marriage that ran her through the mud. \n\nAll I can say is that take his example.
