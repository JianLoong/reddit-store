They would convince my mom to take less child support saying they can\u2019t afford their lifestyle and while my mom was struggling to pay the bills and we had to spend a winter without heat or hot water my dad enrolled my sisters into gymnastics, dance, skating lessons and summer camps for the next year. They would go on vacations every year and buy new clothes for their kids every week. \n\nI had my toys and even furniture at my dads house given to my siblings, at Christmas they would give me clothes that were obviously too small and then give those to my sisters right after I opened it because they knew it would be too small. Even on vacations that I went with them on, they would ask me to babysit or take family pictures of them and any pictures I was in, my stepmom would later crop me out of. I wasn\u2019t allowed to use some of the towels or sheets as they were reserved for the family and not for me, they were the \u201cgood towels and sheets\u201d not for my use, I got to use the old ones and sheets that didn\u2019t fit. I was also told it was my responsibility to take care of my sisters and clean, I would even have to clean their rooms. \n\nMy stepmom couldn\u2019t stand any attention going towards me even when I moved to uni she told my dad she had a depressive episode and he had to take the kids to the zoo instead of helping me but when his other daughter went to uni they helped her move in, stayed the weekend and even decorated for her. \n\nMy stepmom always used her depression to her advantage to get my dad to take care of her or prioritize her kids if I needed him. She made comments as I got into high school and made me feel bad about myself. \n\nAfter the divorce I didn\u2019t think I would be seeing her as often, but my dad invites her to all holidays and events as she is the mother of his kids but he knows how she was towards me and he never stopped her when she those things in front of him, he never told her it wasn\u2019t ok and he still doesn\u2019t think it was wrong because she was depressed. He keeps choosing her over me and he knows she makes me uncomfortable. When I stopped visiting my dad her depression was suddenly manageable and she is so much happier, the whole family is. \n\nWhen I bring it up with my family that I\u2019m not comfortable around her, they say I should just let it go and forgive her, but I can\u2019t. My dad never wants to discuss it and he will defend her actions.

Thing is, I\u2019m 27F and haven\u2019t spoken to my father in 6 years despite the woman who drove a wedge between us long gone and replaced. The damage is done. \n\nI haven\u2019t met his new family, the step siblings or the new toddler daughter. Too much bad blood, I suppose. Any attempt to reach out is usually just to gloss over the past for the sake of keeping appearances. Never got a genuine apology that wasn\u2019t passed onto her as the sole instigator or gaslighting me to undermine his guilt.\n\nOddly enough I forgive HER because what\u2019s done was predictable. The whole frog riding the scorpion story. She was a single mom looking for a provider and my con of a dad is all smiles and charm but a bleeding account full of draft fees. She jumped ship as any other reasonable woman would - but not after poisoning him to prioritize her and her kids over us for 2 years. I jumped that ship halfway once college had a on campus residence opening when I realized I\u2019d assume the scapegoat role. \n\nI can\u2019t extend him the same courtesy because he made that choice to go back on his word. He broke a promise to his own kids to treat us fairly and destroyed whatever progress he had with our mother because his then partner was jealous he was on somewhat civil terms with her, and jealously coaxed her to make an ultimatum. He made his choice and he burned those bridges. Shame, really. \n\nJokes on her - he emotionally cheated and then ultimately moved in her replacement and now theirs playing house with the baby and her pre-existing kids. Yikes. \n\nI\u2019m not gloating out of pettiness. I\u2019m just glad at least one woman had sense. She caught on sooner than my poor mother who was stuck with his shenanigans and two kids. \n\nPraying for the other because that\u2019s going to be a hard lesson to learn. Mom went through all sorts of abuse for a decade - and dealt with divorce for half of span of her marriage that ran her through the mud. \n\nAll I can say is that take his example. Put yourself first. He made his priority and chose his comfort over yours. Don\u2019t do him any more favors if he ain\u2019t trying to reciprocate.", "NTA \n\nDepression doesn't make you treat your stepchild like crap while indulging your bio children.
