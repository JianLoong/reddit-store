It's his fault and he'd be TA here.\n2) He didn't really look with any sort of intent and your stepsister took glances or something else normal the wrong way. I've seen this happen where girls raised on purity culture have absorbed the idea that all men are completely out of control and therefore any looks or anything are indicative of attraction. Less likely, but in this case she would be 100% TA and you'd both be unfairly the victim of her internalized assumptions.\n\nRegardless, it's her/his problem, not yours.

There's no actual evidence in this story that Boyfriend was uncomfortable (thought it's possible) but we know Step-Sister thinks this outfit is bad and tempting to men. Then, despite OP not noticing any inappropriate behavior form the guy being with him all day, Step-sister decided that every time he looked at OP during a day together it must have been beacuse he was checking out OP's scandalous sexy overalls. This is ambiguous, it obviously was not clear what the guy was thinking (since OP didn't get the same vibe), which means what we have here is Step-sister's interpretation. Step-sister assumed he was having dirty thoughts about OP's dirty overalls and skin \"and she had a fight with him because of this\".\n\nThis is all on Step-sister. She is the one who brought OP to her date wearing clothes that Step-sister was upset about. (Boyfriend didn't pick to invite OP.)

Step-sister is the one who invited OP and brought OP along dressed in a way Step-sister thinks is immoral and seductive to men. Then they spent the entire day together and not once did OP feel uncomfortable with Boyfriend, like he was leering at her, or get a creepy or flirtatious vibe from him. Yet, Step-sister decided that he was thinking dirty thoughts about OP beacuse he was looking at OP, which is ambiguous and could be a normal part of being in a four person hang-out.

You were already doing her a favor by coming on her trip so that she can be repressed, ridiculous, and silly. If she's going to demand that someone else has to be around her, then she can't also control what they wear, least of all to such a fine degree.\n\nNTA. Anna is the asshole.", "NTA, you do you OP, also dont even go on these days with your sister or her bf, its just recipe for drama. Also dont let them throw up all this dress how I want and religious stuff if its not by own free will.", "NTA, if he couldn\u2019t stop looking that a him problem not a you problem. Dress how you want as long as its not illegal whats the harm?", "NTA. You did not do anything wrong. He was being a creep.", "NTA. Boyfriend\u2019s eyes are his to manage.", "You don't have to change the way you dress for anyone. You don't go to her church, you don't have the same religion as her or the same beliefs. Just as you respect and accept her as she is, she must do the same to you. These religious people have to stop imposing codes of conduct, morals or clothing on other people. \n\nSecondly, I believe he is used to seeing women dressed like you, as I assume you don't live in any kind of community. A self-respecting man who respects his partner will never look at other women in a sexual or suggestive way. I'm tired of the way women dress is seen as a justifiable reason for being harassed by men.\n\nI think it's disrespectful and disgusting for your sister's boyfriend to look at you that way. If I were you, I wouldn't go with them to any more meetings, nor interact with them.", "NTA \n\nU warned her that u didn't want to go and yet she insist but when you arrive with clothing that her beliefs didn't line up too she gets upset and know what she could of done to prevent it? by not inviting you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe can believe anything that she wants but she also can't just force someone to believe in it especially if they are getting dragged to somewhere they don't want to be.\n\nThe least she can do is allow whatever clothes you can have on because you don't want to be with them when they are dating.", "Congratulations,you just found your new, irrevocable excuse to not participate in their dates anymore. Just say you can't go because what happens if her boyfriend decides to stare at you inappropriately again? Better not risk tempt the poor dude, so you'll just HAVE to excuse yourself. \n\nI also hate so much how woman are constantly blamed for men's action, but now her morals are what is in her own way. The dude's a creep, your sister doesn't like it but can't blame him because ??? and now women are sinful for just existing.\n\nAlso, your cousin saying it's your fault that you tried to impress your crush? Yeah, she's full of bullshit as well, seems the church mentality is still ingrained in her, even if she doesn't attend anymore. \n\nNTA, and you gotta remove yourself from this date situation, for your own sake. Stepdad can accompany them if he's so worried. Or the cousin.", "NTA it's great that your mom is on your side, but i don't understand why she's dating such a controlling dude. the kid obviously grew up like this due to her father's restrictions.", ">I would stop going on their dates. Totally remove yourself from this situation. \n\nStep-sister is treating OP like some kind of inanimate object that only exists to enable her dates, rather than an actual independent human who is doing her a pretty significant favor by playing along with this stupid game.  It's got to be pretty dehumanizing for OP.\n\nReally the obvious solution is, like you said, to just completely refuse to go with them.  Get someone from their church to act as a chaperone if that's how they're going to play it.", "Especially because that goes against Jesus\u2019 teachings! Like ffs, if you\u2019re going to use religion to control others, at least read the text. Jesus told men to pluck out their eyes if their eyes cause them to stumble, not for women to alter their appearance to keep men from being upset", "NTA you can wear what you want.

Even he said the onus is on the boyfriend and that OP did nothing wrong. But the church doesn\u2019t care about that because it\u2019s ruled by men who don\u2019t want to take responsibility and want to instead control women for their ego. \n\nOP you did nothing wrong. Absolutely refuse to do anymore dates with them and do whatever you can to get out of it. Also congrats on asking out your crush I hope you had a great day with them!", "Is the stepsister going to make every female everywhere change their clothes? It\u2019s ridiculous.", "This. Nothing good will come from playing along any further, and blaming her is insane. NTA, OP. Congrats on being brave enough to ask out your crush! That can be tough!", "For the first time I agree, I mean if your with someone then they should obviously have your full attention no matter what someone else is wearing.", "if a man\u2019s eyes cause his to sin, he should pluck them out\n\n- a line that can actually be found in bible (maybe not this exact wording tho)", "This!

Repressing feelings and refusing to provide fact-based sex education are leading causes of single parenthood\u2014and abortions.", "Yeah. When people ask for a favour, they don't get to add conditions like these on top.

It was her stepsister who is a year older than her...", "You're too busy being sanctimonious to even read the post correctly. It was her step sister, not her cousin.  The \"room\" was an amusement park for which she was dressed 100% appropriately.  If step sister doesn't like that OP doesn't follow the same church, then she should find someone else to chaperone her dates.", "No. You dress to fit the room when the room is work or school and you do not go in your pyjama.

And blaming OP for her own ridiculous insecurities.", "Part of me wonders if bf was actually uncomfortable and/or actually looking, since SS told her to change before they even went out. I think the argument might have been real, but instigated by the SS because she needed to vindicate herself about OPs choice of clothing", "Of course all the other young women at the theme park were wearing floor length sacks.", ">Honestly, I'm not even sure boyfriend did anything wrong rather then this all being Step-Sister's hang-ups and insecurities.\n\nI'm not even sure its SS's hang-ups.  I think it's what the church has told her SHOULD be her hang-ups.  \"Dress modestly because men can't control themselves.\"  Well, her beau could have very well been controlling himself just fine, but because the Church told SS that he couldn't, she's obsessing.", "Also a possibility that BF was uncomfortable and didn\u2019t look. So he didn\u2019t engage with OP at all. Which also could have made things tense and awkward. There are times when women\u2019s attire made me uncomfortable for various reasons. My solution was not to look at them. At all.", "NTA, next time she needs to dress more appropriately for the event/weather. Start hiding how to leave a cult pamphlets in her room.", "Or the SSister seeing things and being raised to think all women who don't dress like nuns are sluts and all men who happen to see knees are instantly fantasizing and forgetting their saintly girlfriends.\n\nAll the kids in this story are victims, really.", "We don't know he was actually staring, OP saw nothing of the kind.

Those high control groups are so hard for the kids raised in them, especially girls. I hope she grew up to leave it behind!", "In a private convo later? Her religion doesn\u2019t allow that, apparently.", "But according to their own belief system, G-d is omnipresent. You can\u2019t \u201cput him back\u201d because They are already there.

And, obviously, it would be the woman's fault for having those sexy sexy shoulders and not the man for not plucking his sinning eye out. It was dumb and sexist and infantilising to the men. But eventually they got smarter and just turned the AC down so far you needed a down coat to get through the service without turning into a popsicle and no more shoulders were seen and all sin obviously ended!
