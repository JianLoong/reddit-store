One of the rules is that she can't be alone with guys, she is dating a guy from the same church with the permission of her dad. They had been together for like 2 years and still haven't had a date alone. I had gone with them before and it was absolutely tedious, I had refused to go again, this infuriated my step dad, but my mom backed me up.\n\nHer boyfriend won tickets for an amusement park, which is super expensive, but all their chaperones had plans for the weekend. I had no plans but refused. Anna begged me to go with them. I ended up accepting but I would take someone to make me company. I ended up having some courage and inviting my crush to come.\n\nThat day, I decided to use a short dungaree and a cropped. When Anna saw me, she asked me to change to something else, I told her no. I was happy and feeling cute. She told me my clothes are inappropriate and would make her and her BF uncomfortable, I told her they could just not look at me. She tried to get her father to make me change, but my mom backed me up. And I told her I would just give up on going then.\n\nI barely paid attention to them during the day, but did my function not letting them alone. When we got home Anna was sucking, but I didn't pay much attention and went to my room. The next day she asked me if I didn't have anything to apologize for. I told her no, but to tell me why I should. She told me I made them uncomfortable with my clothes and her boyfriend was looking at me all the time, and she had a fight with him because of this (I didn't see this).\n\nShe blamed me for the fight, and told me it wouldn't had happened if I just changed my clothes when she asked me. I told her to blame her boyfriend. I wouldn't even think twice, but I was speaking with a cousin, who used to go to a similar Church, and she told me I could have prevented all of this if I wasn't dressing up to impress my crush.

Should we all dress, act and think in their way to make them comfortable and happy?? NTA live your independent life.", "NTA. The bible even says something about a man plucking out his eyes if they cause him to sin. The responsibility is with him, not you. You were even ignoring him. So it is purely because he looked at you.", "NTA - never offer to go on a date with her again. She clearly isn't appreciative and she and her church clearly have problems with the autonomy of women. \n\nShe doesn't get to impose her religious values on you or guilt you for her own insecurity and jealousy, especially when she asked you for a favour.\n\nYou wear what you want and you aren't responsible for someone else's reaction to it, men are ultimately responsible for their own wandering eyes. \n\nHonestly, if she thinks her repressed, teenage boyfriend isn't looking at other women while out or online, she's deluded...", "NTA it's not your fault that Anna's boyfriend looked at you and frankly it's creepy behavior on his part given he's dating Anna. If she can't trust him to not have wandering eyes after 2 years of dating, that's a them problem. You do you!", "I grew up in a church that heavily emphasized modesty in dressing. Yet, we were also taught not to stare, to be appropriate, etc\u2026 If the bf can\u2019t be around a girl in shorts without inappropriate thoughts or actions that is a problem he needs to work on. You can\u2019t go to a beach and expect no one to be wearing a bikini. And especially as the warmer months come around, you can\u2019t expect people to not be wearing shorts, tanks, cropped tops, etc\u2026\n\nYou wanted to look cute for your crush which is perfectly normal, ESPECIALLY at your age.

Totally remove yourself from this situation. This is a disaster waiting to happen and I\u2019m so sick and tired and angry with women being blamed for mens behaviour. If he was looking that is his problem not yours. Men are responsible for their own actions.", "NTA. Her religious beliefs aren't yours to abide by or be obligated to. You did your part by agreeing to chaperone them. You didn't agree to adhere to the tenets of her faith.", "NTA. \n\nWhy should you be required to conform to norms of a church that you don\u2019t even belong to? You were already doing Anna a favor by going so she could go to the amusement park. She doesn\u2019t get to control how you dress. She then blames you for a fight that she had with her bf because of her insecurities (or maybe his legitimate wandering eyes) but probably a combo when really all you were doing was existing. You do not owe her an apology.", "That Big book they follow most likely says that If someones looks tempt / attract one, one should gouge his / hers own eyes out.

It's rude to police other's clothing regardless of any religious nonsense one chooses to believe.  \n\nAlso, not your problem that your stepsister's BF has a wandering eye.  Perhaps if he'd been exposed to girls in normal attire up to now he wouldn't be so distracted by your skin.  Does he never go out in public during the warmer months? \n\nNTA", "Short dungarees are now considered scandalous? What in the world?\n\nObviously you're NTA for not changing. I'd also urge you to stand firm about the whole 'bf allegedly staring at you' thing. If that's true it really isn't your responsibility and she needs to learn that. Not just for the purposes of this argument but also she could find herself in a lot of messy situations if she accepts blame for men looking at her or generally overstepping.\n\nEdit: synonym", "NTA. I hate the idea that women are automatically responsible for how men look at them. If her bf really was staring at you then he's the problem, not you.", "NTA - you were going on a date with your crush.

So then another women said \u201cwe need god back where he belongs, everywhere!\u201d. So neat, you don\u2019t want people \u201cforcing\u201d things on you, but it\u2019s perfectly fine for you to force your religion on everyone?? What about that \u201cfreedom\u201d conservative Christians scream about all the time?? These people are the reason i left the church and barely have any faith at all.", "Yes, clearly we should live according to conservative ideology, hence all the obsessive control they try to have on government, schools, women's bodies...

What's even worse is women blaming women for a man's behavior.", "\ud83d\udcaf It\u2019s bad enough when men do it, but even worse when women do."]}
