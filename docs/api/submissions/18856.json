It's his fault and he'd be TA here.\n2) He didn't really look with any sort of intent and your stepsister took glances or something else normal the wrong way. I've seen this happen where girls raised on purity culture have absorbed the idea that all men are completely out of control and therefore any looks or anything are indicative of attraction. Less likely, but in this case she would be 100% TA and you'd both be unfairly the victim of her internalized assumptions.\n\nRegardless, it's her/his problem, not yours.

There's no actual evidence in this story that Boyfriend was uncomfortable (thought it's possible) but we know Step-Sister thinks this outfit is bad and tempting to men. Then, despite OP not noticing any inappropriate behavior form the guy being with him all day, Step-sister decided that every time he looked at OP during a day together it must have been beacuse he was checking out OP's scandalous sexy overalls. This is ambiguous, it obviously was not clear what the guy was thinking (since OP didn't get the same vibe), which means what we have here is Step-sister's interpretation. Step-sister assumed he was having dirty thoughts about OP's dirty overalls and skin \"and she had a fight with him because of this\".\n\nThis is all on Step-sister.

Step-sister is the one who invited OP and brought OP along dressed in a way Step-sister thinks is immoral and seductive to men. Then they spent the entire day together and not once did OP feel uncomfortable with Boyfriend, like he was leering at her, or get a creepy or flirtatious vibe from him. Yet, Step-sister decided that he was thinking dirty thoughts about OP beacuse he was looking at OP, which is ambiguous and could be a normal part of being in a four person hang-out.
