It's not your responsibility.\n\nFriends and roommates help. They don't become responsible for the housing and care etc. of the baby.", "NTA. Not your kid, not your wife, not your reaponsibility. Babies, aside from your own, are the most annoying beings in existence.", "NTA she was expecting you as a friend to step up on the days you work from home to be free child care for her.  Or else help with her child.  You are not obligated to help in any way. There are programs out there for her to help with utilities, food, and medical.  For those talking about abandoning her, you are the baby daddy, she is your roommate, not your lover and those same friends need to help her instead of calling you out.", "Her decision to get pregnant and have the child without a partner is not your problem. If anyone tries to shame you, you tell them they are welcome to be a much better person than yourself and live with your pregnant roommate. It would really piss me off that she would assume I would let my standard of living suck on account of her.\n\nAsk her what she thinks you would get out of the situation? What would be in it for you? As I see it, you would be guilt tripped into being a surrogate dad.\n\nShe obviously didn't think this through and seemed to be entitled enough to think that you would eat this bullshit with a knife and fork.\n\nDon't cave. She is going to be a mother soon and will have no money or time to ever help you in return.\n\nRelationships are about reciprocity.", "NTA. You aren't obligated to be an extra babysitter or parent to someone else's baby.", "NTA but do offer to help her pack and move.  Tell your friend (& everyone) that is about getting your own space,", "NTA - You didn't knock her up.  Her mistakes  are her responsibility.  If the father isn't around and she isn't prepared to deal with this alone, she could have terminated the pregnancy.    \n\n\nThis is entirely her mistake and she's trying to foster the burden onto you.  God for you getting out of this mess.", "NTA. \u201cI\u2019ll be moving closer to work and this allows her to move into this new chapter of her life with her newborn\u201d.", "Unless you are somehow responsible for her being pregnant, then NTA. \n\nLet the people telling you otherwise to step up and offer her a bedroom in their places.", "NTA. She\u2019s responsible for her own life and you\u2019re responsible for yours. If she thinks she\u2019s mature enough to have a kid she can surely figure out her own living situation.\n\nIf your friends think you\u2019re an AH, they should offer to take her in and live with a newborn. If I had to guess, no one has done that. Way easier to point fingers at you then do anything themselves.", "NTA.\n\nYou are in good company, second one this week\n\nMaybe she and the other one can share an apartment with their babies.\n\nJust tell her you are moving closer to work and you have to have a dedicated office for wfh home days and won\u2019t have room. \n\nThat works for anyone else who is in this situation.   \n\nRoommate needs to reach out to the person that created the baby for help.  Not you.", "NTA she\u2019s mad a free babysitter is leaving", "Her problems are not yours NTA!!!!!!", "NTA. Moving because you don't want to live with a baby that's not yours is a valid reason. Anyone giving you flack over it let them know you will forward their contact information to your roommate so they can discuss future living arrangements.", "NTA, no one is entitled to being attached to you all the time.", "NTA. You have no obligation to continue rooming with your friend after the current lease us up.\n\nShe's upset because she expected you to help with her baby. Don't offer to help. Don't babysit. Find a new place", "You're not her life partner, the co-creator of her child or anything else other than a friend. This isn't the -1 version of Three Men and a Baby. \n\nGranted she's under a lot of stress but it's entitled of her to expect you to help raise her baby. Your other friends can step up, since they're so opinionated.", " You didn\u2019t get her pregnant,  not your concern", "NTA. Roommate and baby are not your responsibility. How are you going to work from home with screaming newborn? Do what's best for you.", "Her lack of prior planning does not make it an emergency  for you or your problem ? How much work from home would get done with baby crying or you drafted as a baby sitter ?", "NTA.  You didn't get a say in her pregnancy, she doesn't have a say in where you choose to live, or who choose to you live with.", "NAH - it\u2019d be one thing if it was mid January and you were blindsiding her, but you\u2019re not. This is a perfectly fine amount of notice. As for her, it\u2019s perfectly understandable to be feeling hurt/like she\u2019s losing a close friendship, worried about her baby-to-be and living situation, seeking out the rest of her support system, etc. Neither of you has done anything wrong here (well, maybe your mutual friends have, they should be staying tf out of it unless they\u2019re looking to room with one of you) and hopefully once she\u2019s had time to process the news and lay the groundwork for her next living situation she will be able to see that you\u2019ve not done wrong by her and this will not be long-term too damaging to your friendship.", "Yep. OP didn't have any part in making this baby so why are they now on the hook for supporting mom and baby? More importantly, why do all the friends this so?", "Isn't it always the way on this sub - an empty handed peanut gallery trying to guilt trip someone into doing what they have no intention of doing. If I had a dollar...", "What if roommate offers to move to wherever OP moves to? Move in with OP wherever OP ends up.\n\n\nNo point sugarcoating it. The pregnancy is the reason for OP moving. It makes sense not wanting to live with her baby especially with her WFH needs. OP shouldn't hide that.\n\nAnd anyone who has a problem with that is welcome to move in with OP's roommate after OP leaves.\n\nNTA", "> do not say it's bc of her pregnancy\n\nI dunno about that. Almost nobody that isn't part of the baby's family should want to live with a newborn. Everything about them completely screws your ability to function. Loss of sleep, interruptions, etc. I don't think there's anything bad or abnormal about saying you don't want to live with a newborn.\n\nAnd I'd say it's VERY likely that she had plans for OP to help her raise the child (babysit at the very least).", "It's the same thing with other people telling you what you should do with your money.  They have no intention of stepping up or volunteering. It's easier  to attack the person who said no.", "eh, there's no need to beat around the bush.  \"I don't want to live with a newborn, a baby, or a toddler\" -- anyone who has done any of those understands.\n\nOr, \"I like sleeping through the night\", or I want to be able to watch tv / or make reasonable noise at adult times, or I don't want to be babysitting, or I don't want to smell diapers, or I want to occasionally come home drunk...", "I agree to not make it about pregnancy even though obviously that\u2019s part of your reason. You weren\u2019t going to live together for the rest of your life. She has the option to find a smaller and cheaper place or find a roommate. Maybe there\u2019s someone else with a young kid that needs a housemate and it would be an ideal situation. Either way, this is her issue to address and not yours.", "So she can go find another person to move in when you move out.  A clean exchange.  Her getting upset about it isn't going to get her a good solution, and hello, babies aren't a spontaneous cell mutation.  Someone else has to have been in the picture.  Are they helping?  That's their job.  Not yours.", "OP already disabused her roommate of the notion they'd continue as roommates", "You gotta step up if this was the magical first time two women had a baby without even having sex, immaculatish conception is serious business!\n\nMore seriously, I do feel bad since I'm sure you'd like to stay friends but living with a newborn would not be fun. With unlimited money and unlimited time you could do it. And unlimited sleep. But we don't get those things.", "Yeah, that's what I got from this too. She was expecting OP to coparent. Probably also \"hey, since you WFH, you can...\"", "Guarantee she\u2019s hoping roomie will provide free childcare while working from home and take care of childcare for the mom on days when she has to rto.  \n\nHahahahahaha.   Probably what the dad said.", ">I figured the issue was that moving while 6 months pregnant would be a major hassle.  Likewise would be finding a single roommate willing to move in with someone about to give birth.\n\nThat was my take."]}
