He knows where I live, he has my number and my Facebook. We are amicable. He can reach out any time and I will never keep them from each other. He just chooses not to. And he opted out of parental rights so that's entirely his choice.\n\nBut yes, this is one reason why my brother was specified. Not only does he play an active role in my son's life, but he has expressed directly to me that he would be more than happy to take him in if the worst happened to me.", "I am hoping it was an offhand comment because she had been thinking about \"what ifs\" and not something she's set on or going to push. Thanks, if she brings it up again I will probably say that.", "To be clear I am not in the US. I do know our laws around parental rights/ child support are a bit different here.\n\nLegally here, by not signing the birth certificate, he is not a legal parent. Therefore he does not have to pay child support, and he has no parental rights. If I wanted to go after him for child support I would need to have his paternity proven, either through joint testimonies or DNA testing. This would then give him parental rights, regardless of the birth certificate. It would then be up to the courts to determine how much child support I would get, and how to split custody/ visitation to suit everyone.\n\nIf I do not ever take him for child support, and he never petitions for his rights to be reinstated, my son will only ever have one legal parent. With only one legal parent, I don't have to stipulate that anyone is dead. Because legally, he has nothing to do with anything.\n\nAlso, to be clear, if he petitioned for his rights, I am more than happy for him to have them. That is his choice. If he decides he wants that, and wants to be involved, that's ok with me. But he will be up for backpay of child support. So far it's 2 years worth. And every week it gets more. If he cant pay it, it will be taken directly by the government from his pay or he will go to jail. Again, that's his choice.", "You can't just \"stipulate\" that a person you know to be alive is dead.", "The legal process he would have to go through where I live would be that he would have to go through the courts, prove his paternity, and then backpay child support to me/ my estate (depending on whether I was alive or not when he did that). Specifying a legal guardian of my brother in my will without him doing that (because legally I am the only parent) is perfectly legal. \n\nYes, if he went through that process he would get custody. But if I specify them in my will, he would not have to do that. But also, I know my parents would fight it, because of how absent he has been his entire life, and because of our agreement. Then he would have to prove it anyway.\n\nBut let me clarify- it's the mother of his OTHER child and current partner who bought this up- not him. I do not know if he is even aware she has said this to me nor even wants to take in my child should I die. I haven't spoken to him directly for 3 months.", "I assume since she gave birth she's been thinking about that stuff for herself, and so that's why she mentioned it. I also was struck with a bit \"what if\" feeling after I gave birth.", "Unless she or the loser plans to get rid of OP? Because now that he has a child with the other person he finally got his paternal feelings in.", "She is nice and I'm very glad that my son's brother has such an easy woman to get along with so they can have some sort of relationship growing up.\nShe does know. Obviously there was the agreement between me and him about what that meant, and honestly I'm ok with that. If he doesn't want to be my kids dad he doesn't have to. I just get a bit irritated that in my house we refer to him by name, and when my son does see him, they refer to him as \"your dad\" \ud83d\ude2c but he's not in any way except genetically.", "Yes, I mean all I see of his parenting of baby is what she posts on socials, and of course she's going to post the good stuff. I don't know what else happens in their home and frankly it's none of my business.", "If you take any emotional argument like \"he should be with his dad/ two parents/ his brother\" out of it, my brother is a clearly better choice. He is more involved in my son's life, more financially stable, has a large enough house for him to be able to live there, he's also even had experience raising a child (he was a step dad for a time, but they didn't work out). I've also had conversations with my brother about my son's future schooling, sporting etc and he agrees with me, or at the very least respects my opinion as his mother. I can't say the same for the others.", "He is not legally his dad. He is not on the birth certificate. He would need to attend court to prove his paternity, and backpay child support to my estate, before he could fight my wishes dictated in my will.", "DNA is not the only factor.", "Not true. If the parent is not actively involved in the life and the active parent puts someone else who is. They will definitely lean towards that.", "My father wanted nothing to do with me. If my mom died, I would have been raised by her sister. DNA doesn't always matter.", "Also that\u2019s False information. I know a father right now who wasn\u2019t a part of his child\u2019s life by his own doing for the first four years. Mom died in a car accident and the child was left to the cousin of the mother. The father is now trying to fight it and even with him having signed the birth certificate is fighting a losing battle FOR HAVING BEEN ABSENT THE WHOLE TIME PRIOR. Get off Reddit and do research before posting mouth diarrhea because the correct answer to that part is it varies by state law. \n\nNTA.  And it\u2019s truly none of the fathers/\u201cstepmothers\u201d business since clearly sperm donors a dead beat anyway. \n\nThis is coming from a father of four who has custody of all four of his children, and has left his children in case something happens to me to the care of my parents even though both of the separate mothers are still alive.", "I really hope you aren't actually a lawyer, as you wouldn't be very good at it if you were. \n\nBest interests of the child are always the top consideration in any custodial dispute. The court will also always consider the will of the parent/guardian with decision making, as the standing action in child placement. They will also prioritize kinship care persons who are bonded to the child as a primary determining factor in any child placement dispute. \n\nSo based on actual family court standards, seeing as the mother is the only named legal parent, or guardian, her wishes for child placement, and the fact that the child is more bonded to the uncle, would be the premier considerations in determining who his caregivers would ultimately be in the event of the mother's death, or compromised mental competence.", "To be clear this conversation was with the mother of his other child, not with the father. I have no idea if he wants or has even thought of this himself. I have looked into what he would have to do should he want custody and honestly he is welcome to do it if he wants to. He is not abusive or anything. \n\nI am not going to presume he suddenly wants to take care of a child he hasn't wanted much to do with previously unless he tells me himself. I am not going to specify him as guardian (as he is not legally my son's parent) unless he has a conversation with me himself about wishing that. If I die I am certainly not leaving my child in the care of someone who doesn't want it simply because they're blood related.\n\nHe is always welcome to start to make more of an effort any day. He has my number, my Facebook, my address, and I have never and will never say no to them seeing each other.", "No, she has told me that they decided he would go to either of their parents. I'm not related to their son at all, but biologically (not legally) that is his father. I think that's why they think it's different.", "By him not being on the birth certificate, they are. If he wants them, he will have to attend the courts, do a DNA test, and backpay all child support to me/ my estate. It will be a big cost to him which, frankly, I know they can't afford.", "I think having a new baby just got her thinking \"what if\" you know? I did the same when he was born, suddenly everything like this becomes a lot more important than it was before.", "I am not in the US.\nWhere I live, by not being on the birth certificate, he has no parental rights, as he is not legally the parent.\n\nHe is within his rights to change that through the courts should he wish to. To my knowledge, he doesn't wish to.\n\nHonestly I think she just assumed I would specify them as guardians because my son and his father are blood related. There is a process he can go through to get parental rights and custody and I am not opposed to that at all if that's what he wants. But to my knowledge it's not.", "I can count on one hand how many times he has seen him in the last 12 months. Last time he came by to drop off come Christmas presents and was upset my son didn't recognise him, after not seeing him for 4 months. There's no need really for me to cut him off cos he's barely there anyway. For all my son knows he's just one of mums friends we see every now and then. \nI also am aware that if I give him any resistance, should he want to see him, it could be used against me in the future. I don't think it's likely but in my experience you never really know people.", "I am not in the USA. I have spoken to a lawyer.\nBy not being on the birth certificate he never got any parental rights as he is not a legal parent. \n\nAs it stands, if I died my will stipulates that the guardianship of my child goes to my brother. \n\nOf course at any point (whether I am dead or alive) he could go to court and get his parental rights. And deal with all the costs and responsibilities associated with that. If that is something he decides he wants to do I am not against it. But as far as I know he doesn't want to do that.\n\nThe conversation was between myself and his wife, who I guess made the assumption because my son and he are blood related that I would stipulate them as guardians. I am not going to name a guardian who, to my knowledge, has no interest in being one.", "Of course if he did go to court after my death and get his rights reinstated, then he will have to pay back child support to my estate, which I have specified to be held in trust for my son until he is 21. \nIf I was to name them guardian without him proving his parenthood, he would not be up for any back child support. So either way I feel it's in my son's best interest as it is currently.\n\nOf course if he becomes a different person overnight and comes to me and makes a genuine effort to have a relationship with my son and wants to get his parental rights while I am alive I am of course open to it.  But again, as far as I know, he is more than happy to pretend we don't exist.", "No telling what a court would say should you pass and the bio-dad try to insist on a DNA test and assert parental rights. Bio-dad might try to spin some story of how he tried repeatedly to be involved but you prevented it.\n\nGet this squared away with a lawyer. Be specific. Unless a lawyer specifically advised you, do not just assume that if his name isn't on the birth certificate that there is no way he could try to force himself into a parental role should something happen to you.", "Stop allowing him to see your son. That\u2019s your problem. It leaves your will open to contest.", "I am not sure that means anything.  Lots of reddit lawyers don't know what they are talking about, plus the law is complex.  See lawyer is the only answer.", "All it takes is a DNA test and he can assert his rights", "What about life insurance? Your ex may say he doesn't want anything to do with your son but once money gets involved all bets are off. Maybe see a trust lawyer/planner. Best of luck to you and your son.", "Fair enough. I think everyone's concern here was just making sure that you were protected in your decision.", "You actually can. \"For purposes of this will, XXXX is to be pre-deceased\" and is perfectly legal in a will.\n\nHaving both created, stood witness to for signing, and assisted in executing several wills.", "Does she somehow expect you to take over raising their child if they both die?", "Yeah that would annoy me too. He doesn\u2019t act as a dad to your kid, he shouldn\u2019t get the title.", "Instead of arguing this, just go see a lawyer.  I don't really want the guy to get your child, I just know that he could pretty easily.  Paternity is easy to prove, child support would probably be moot.  Listen to people telling you this, it is not just me.", "I don't know where in the world OP is, but in the US courts take severing parental rights pretty seriously. Even lack of previous involvement isn't going to be a serious obstacle if there's nothing else wrong with him. The fact he's providing a stable home for another child would be a point in his favor too.", "The argument isn't that it matters morally. Of course it doesn't.\n\nBut your assumption of who would have gotten custody of you was (fortunately) never tested by your mother dying and your father and aunt going to court to decide on custody.", "Gotcha, that makes sense! Like I said\u2026 too many Datelines lol. Either way, you\u2019re definitely NTA!", "NTA\n\nHowever even though you are in a jurisdiction in which the father doesn't have paternal rights, it does appear that he could add his name to the birth certificate if he wanted - unless I am misunderstanding.\n\nI am assuming he doesn't want to do that because it would also mean he would have financial or other obligations.\n\nHowever, things can change especially since he would seem to have pressure from the wife to take the child.\n\nI would consult an experienced family lawyer in your jurisdiction to make sure that you have done everything necessary to prevent the bio father from taking custody - since that it not what you feel is in the best interests of your son.", "I have spoken to a lawyer, supplied to them copies of text messages etc. should they ever be needed. I have friends who have been witness to all of this who I have given the names and numbers to my lawyer for.\n\nBut to be clear, if I did pass away and he wanted to take custody he is welcome to do so. That's his choice. There is a process I've outlined in other comments he would have to go through. \n\nBut I am not going to specify him as the guardian for my son when as far as I know he has no interest in that.\n\nThe conversation was with his wife, not him. I have no idea if she even spoke to him about it or just assumed herself.", "As I write this is it April 11th, last time he saw him was December 29th. The time before that was August. I don't think he would have much of a case there tbh.", "I am not in the US, and I don't have life insurance. I don't own a house or have many assets. Probably the most I have is in my retirement fund (which is legislated that I can't access until retirement age, and would go into my son's name/ account if he has one should I die before then) and I don't think that's enough to bother with court costs and back child support payments", "Yes it's an unusual situation I know. I know a lot of people can't understand opting out of their child's life but he has, and honestly I respect that he did that rather than just be an absent father/ abandon us and cause more hurt and trauma you know?", "And you can sever parental rights that way?", "No they have specified the guardianship of their child go to his parents. I am not related to their son at all. I think because he is blood related to my son, she has assumed that they would take him if something happens.", "Yep. Not legally his dad, doesn't act like a dad, not his dad. Honestly he is just a donor. I don't mean to be rude but that's what it is and I'm fine with it. They are blurring that with the \"dad\" talk", "I have seen a lawyer about this. If he wanted to get custody he very well could. The point I am making is that as far as I know he doesn't want it. Why would I specify guardianship to someone who doesn't want it?\n\nIt was a conversation with his wife and she made an assumption (I suppose) and I'm asking if I'm the AH for not correcting her assumption. I have no idea if she even spoke to him about it at all.", "That would only be if he petitioned the court and prove he was the father since he not on the birth certificate. Plus he probably wont be informed she died unless her family told them.", "I am not opposed to him seeking parental rights if he wants them. He said at the start he didn't want them and I am under the assumption unless he tells me otherwise that that hasn't changed", "If he decided he wanted to do that, I am open to it. He is not abusive or anything- he simply chose not to be my son's parent and is continuing to not be his parent.\n\nIf he wanted to be his parent, whether I was dead or alive, I am open to that. It would mean he will have done a complete mental 180. If he does go for rights and get on the birth certificate (and all the financial things that would mean) my will would need to be redone anyway, if I was alive at that point. I would obviously take into consideration how he was acting and what involvement he wanted to have at that point and perhaps reassess.\n\nAs it stands now, to my knowledge he does not want parental rights for my son and so I am not going to name him guardian should I pass away.", "Thank you. Again, best wishes to you both.", "Depends on the situation and state. Some states, a birth to an unmarried woman the father has no rights unless they go to court and can prove they are the father.\n\nThe father can fight the will and must have a good reason to win the case. But yes, you can dictate in a will of an unmarried person who is to be considered deceased.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rude at all. Sounds like she pushes him to be more involved? Or is that wrong?\n\nShe may have a hard time reconciling how he can show interest/be good with her child but not be that way with yours. \n\nShe seems cool, or at least someone I\u2019m willing to let my kid around. Him? Not so much.", "Why are you even bothering to let this \u201cdonor\u201d around your son? It sounds like the few times you invite him to be part of your sons life, he\u2019s a disappointment who doesn\u2019t show up. Seems like your son would be better off never seeing him then having the baby daddy as a disappointment", "Yes, he could easily petition the court for this (if he was so inclined). And he'd likely find out, as his wife seems to communicate regularly with OP.", "I think she is very much the driving force in their relationship. I don't know the intricacies of their relationship or how he is with their child, just the photos she posts on socials and what she tells me. It does seem like he is more involved and doing everything right which is great for them.", "I will admit in the past (especially the first year of his life) I really made an effort to get them together. I'll blame postpartum hormones and my \"friend\" in my ear telling me how important it was for my son to have a relationship with his father despite him not wanting to be his father. I absolutely gave up on that after my son's first birthday. I just couldn't understand how someone could want nothing to do with their child. Honestly part of that was on me for trying to push a relationship he clearly had no interest in.\n\nI will never say no because he's not abusive or anything, but honestly I haven't had to say no because he doesn't make any effort. Which is fine because he clearly said he doesn't want to.\n\nHis wife wants to make an effort because our kids are siblings and that's great, I am more than happy to be friendly with her. I think if she wasn't there and organised things we probably wouldn't ever see him again.", "Yes she does. He also has my Facebook, my number, my address. He can communicate with me whenever he likes. He chooses not to.", "Tbh for me, the idea of your son growing up, watching his bio dad not give two shits about him while actively parenting his sibling seems cruel", "NTA", "Just because he's not on the birth certificate, doesn't mean if something happened he couldn't petition and prove a dna match.  \n\nI would check with a lawyer to make sure that you can actually give guardianship to your brother, and have it stick.", "NTA you need to talk to your lawyer on other things as well.  This almost sounds like the start of a move to get joint or full custody of your child.  They will try to claim that they as a couple are better off to raise a child.", "NTA. She's making assumptions and sounds kind but your ex isn't on the birth certificate. No idea if the court would adjudicate him as the dad fir custody if you died; he's had minimal contact. His wife might be able to get him to go to court but your wishes have been made clear.", "NTA.   If he really wanted to be a part of his son's life he would've allowed himself to be added to the birth certificate.    It's your right to leave him to whoever you want.", "As much as I can I have done that, but there is no way for me to 100% ensure my son goes to my brother, if my ex decides to go for custody by proving his parentage he can do that. He has done nothing that would deem him an unfit parent to at least have some custody/ access should he choose to do that, so I am not able to stop it. At best I can collect and provide evidence that he has not made an effort to be in his life up to that point, and that they are not able to care for two children financially, and hope that a judge would give primary custody to my brother and allow an arrangement with his father.\n\nHowever I honestly think that scenario is unlikely because to my knowledge he doesn't want custody of my son at all.", "Of course if he wanted to go through the court process to prove he is the father and gain his parental rights he could do that. He would of course then be up for court fees, back payment of child support to my estate (i.e. to my son), etc. My brother I am sure would have no trouble proving his complete lack of involvement in my son's life so far, and a judge would be able to decide on a suitable arrangement with that.\n\nHowever to my knowledge he does not want parental rights or responsibilities for my son now or in the event of my death, so I have no named him guardian because... Well obviously that wouldn't be what's best for my son.", "Unless my son's father had done something that would deem him to be an unsuitable parent, which he has not, there is no way for me to completely legally block him from deciding to prove himself as my son's father and take on the rights and responsibilities associated with that. If he did decide to do this one day, however, whether I am dead or alive a judge would take into account his complete lack of involvement for however long it goes on.\n\nBut again as far as I am aware he had no interest or intention of doing that", "Without talking too much about myself or them, absolutely no judge in their right mind would look at their financial situation and deem them more suitable than me. I am very frugal and responsible with my money and they are not so much. I have evidence of them asking for financial help on Facebook multiple times in order to feed their pets because they \"ran out of money this week\"\n\nI have spoken to a lawyer about this and I am very careful with my money for this exact reason. I don't drink, gamble, nothing. I have no debts and pay all my bills ahead.\n\nI do not live in a place that would consider them automatically better than me just because they are a married couple", "Yes it's unlikely they would get sole custody, or no custody/visitation at all. Likely a judge would make an assessment based on a variety of factors to try and determine what would be best for my son. I am doing the best I can in the meantime.", "Here is a scenario for you to consider:\nSeeing as your ex's wife is the one initiating everything, I'm betting that she would threaten to leave him if he didn't fight for your son if something happened to you. So then you have an issue of him raising your son and your son not getting the proper love from his father figure. You need to take into consideration what is the best thing for your son. You know how he will be treated by your brother, but you can't guarantee that his father would treat the two children equally. Then what happens if him and his spouse were to divorce, you really think he is going to want his son after all of these years of not wanting him and ONLY making an effort because the wife set it up.", "Keep collecting the evidence and make sure your brother knows where it is kept.\n\nIt may just be the wife feels like your child should belong with them, but in reality, you child  needs to be the people who will develop a relationship with him as he grows.  \n\nYou sound like a good parent, thinking ahead an preparing for worst.", "To be clear if he went for his parental rights, whether I was alive or dead, there is no way for me to 100% ensure he can't get them. He has done nothing to deem him and unfit parent. Our laws don't allow for that.\n\nThe best I can do is collect evidence in case it is ever needed and hope a judge would make a fair assessment and award sole custody to my brother with visitation for his father. But more likely they will split the custody, unless my ex changes it up completely before this happens.\nI have done and continue to do everything I can within the law to ensure the best situation for my son should the worst happen.", "I have come back to clarify that where I live there is no way for me to prevent him for gaining at least some custody of he wanted to whether I was dead or alive. All he would have to do is prove his parentage and take on the financial responsibilities dictated by law. Honestly I think that's a great law to have for split families.\n\nThe only way to stop that would to prove he is an unfit parent. I can't prove that because he's not, except that he has no interest or involvement with my son. All I can do is gather evidence of the situation so that in the event that this does happen the judge can make a fair judgement. My brother can still have part custody of my son even if his father wanted to take custody after I die.", "Do you have life insurance or a 401k, or any money that would go to your son should you die? He may not have any interest in your son or being a father now, but maybe inheritance/money might make him more interested. Do you really want him to be able to get custody of your son when you know he has previously shown little interest? Why not be more secure and sure that your son and his best interests are being taken care of?", "You are talking to human beings.  Most of us care more about the welfare of a child then whether or not you are an asshole.  That is a good thing.", "I am not in the US, so no I don't have life insurance, but yes I do have a retirement fund. There are laws surrounding this money though, if I were to die it would not be paid out, but transferred to the account of my beneficiary (I have gone through the process to make this binding) which is my son. There are specific laws for this sort of thing where I live. Even if he decided to get custody for money, I don't have a house or many assets, and he wouldn't be able to touch that retirement money. Honestly he would have 2 years so far of back child support to pay, or risk jail, and if my math is right it won't be much longer until that amount would be more than any money he would get from my estate.", "Yes.\nTo be clear if he wanted to prove his parentage and gain part or full custody whether I was dead or alive I am not able to block that. He has done nothing to make him an unfit parent and our laws don't allow us to block access completely to people who want to be parents to their children. All I can to is gather evidence to assist a judge in making a good decision for my son if it came to that.", "You're not wrong. It's something I struggle and cry about a lot. Obviously when I went into having a child I was under the impression he was going to be a father to him. By the time he communicated to me that he wasn't going to, there was no way for me to not continue the pregnancy. \n\nI absolutely did not expect him to have another child with someone else so soon after, and I certainly couldn't have ever foreseen him being such a different person to that child.\n\nIt's a situation I never saw myself having to navigate and honestly I don't know what the correct way to do it is. What I do know is that I'm not going to force a relationship that the other person doesn't want. That's clear.\n\nMy son is of course still small and doesn't know this man as his father. But of course one day he will, I'm not going to try and keep a secret from him like that. There will be hard feelings there for him regardless.\n\nBut again, I don't know what does on in their house except what the wife tells me and what she post on social media. We definitely don't have the kind of friendship where she could come to me complaining about him.\n\nI am just trying my best, taking each day and interaction (as few and far between as they are) at a time. There's no one clear right answer on how to manage this.\n\nI do engage with regular therapy and other supports as for advice about specific situations if and when they should arise.", "I wish everyone would stop giving the OP legal advice that they didn't ask for. They have a lawyer. They asked if they were the asshole. No you are not. I am making my husband's close friend (who is trans) the guardian of our kids. I am not telling my family at all. My husband's folks know, but I see no reason to fight with my folks. Yes they might argue if my husband and I die and I just have to trust that my will and family and friends are able to stand up for our wishes.", "WHY IS HIS WIFE TELLING YOU TO GET YOUR WILL DONE IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO YOU????? are we just gonna bypass that entirely??? was this apart of a conversation you were having?? or was this brought up randomly?? NTA but seriously concerning if this was random.", "NTA... but if bio dad is involved in his life, he should pay child support!", "NTA but you should definitely specify that they will not be his guardians, as they might use the fact that you said they would be in court", "Thankyou. \nMany people trying to tell me what the law is without even knowing where I am \ud83d\ude05 I am getting tired of writing the same thing.", "We were chatting about schools and how the boys wouldn't be going to the same school (just due to where we live and our different views on some minor things), and she mentioned how it's strange that suddenly when they are here everything that was so unimportant before is suddenly so important. Then she made a comment about my will. I've never discussed my will with her before so I guess she just assumed I hadn't done one (probably because she hasn't) and also assumed that I would want my son to go live with them. I don't think it was anything other than her just talking out loud but I didn't correct her so idk.\nIf I died tomorrow she would be in for a bit of a surprise I guess", "If it's ever bought up again I definitely will. I was caught off guard.\nI would be very surprised if any weight is ever given to \"but one time she said to me\" in court when there's legal documents stating that that's not the case.", "Yes, she may have thought about it, but it's not something you mention to people, especially demanding who the child goes to.\n\nIn my country one doesn't have the option to choose anyway, the surviving parent takes the child. I'm dreading that if something happens to me, my kid will stay with his father and will turn out super spoiled and inconsiderate.", "> Here is a scenario for you to consider: Seeing as your ex's wife is the one initiating everything, I'm betting that she would threaten to leave him if he didn't fight for your son if something happened to you.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that she might also be under the impression that OP would take in her ex\u2019s new kid if something happened to him and his new baby mama.", "FYI, there's nothing particularly US-centric about life insurance; I live in Europe, and it's not uncommon here. (Not sure about other regions, though!) If you think it would benefit your child / family, you may want to look into it.", "It's definitely not uncommon for people to have for sure, but it's very uncommon for someone on my sort of income. I am a single mother and I don't have excess cash for things like that.\nDefinitely if I had more money coming in it would be something I would consider.", "What about his parents? How do they treat your kid?", "His mum and stepdad are lovely, but we don't see them very much (maybe once a month). We haven't seen or heard from his dad and stepmother in over a year now, but I do know they've been in contact with the new baby.", "NTA she is playing happy families in her head while the childs father doesn't care.  \n\nShe is deluded.  Don't discuss it further with her, and maybe make it clear in your will that your child is not to go to her.", "NTA\n\nBut why do you spend time with them?", "Don't do that to your child. Don't put him in the situation of having to go through a legal battle because his absent father's wife wants to be involved. He doesn't care about your child, your brother does. He wants to keep his wife happy, which is why he shows up when she tell him to. Do you think your kid won't see that? And what happens if he gets custody and they get divorced? Or if she dies too? Your poor kid would be stuck with a father that doesn't love or care about him, instead of with his loving uncle. \n\nDon't leave your son vulnerable just because you think a man who's been an absolute asshole should have the chance to be redeemed.", "She might push him to go to court.  Please make sure this doesn't happen.", "It's not up to me- it's the law. He has done nothing that would legally deem him unsuitable should he seek custody. All I can do is put my wishes into my will (which I have because again, I have no indication that my ex wants anything to do with my son), and do my best to give the judge enough information to make a good decision.\n\nPlease remember we are talking a very unlikely hypothetical situation here whereby not only do I pass away before my son can communicate his wishes himself/ be an adult, and my ex does a complete 180 and decides to be a father. \n\nIdeally I would prefer to stay alive for ay least the next 16 years until my son is an adult. Longer, if possible \ud83d\ude05", "I'm doing my best."]}
