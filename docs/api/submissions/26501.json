Last night, my girlfriend had her good friend Amy (F) sleep over. Amy's friend Josh (M) slept on our couch because he was drunk. I met Josh one time a week ago at the bar. My girlfriend doesn't have a phone at the moment, so she walked to Amy's to see if Amy would spend the night with her. She is understandably nervous being home alone without a phone. Josh was at Amy's and my gf invited them both back to our apartment. They hung out until 2AM and my gf invited him to sleep on the couch while she and Amy slept in our bed.\n\nThis AM, I was messaging my girlfriend at work via Facebook. She was upset that her computer had broken overnight. We msg'd back and forth for a bit about her broken computer and other things. At one point, frustrated about her computer, she mentioned that perhaps Josh broke it when he slept over on our couch last night. There was no mention of Amy, only that Josh slept on the couch. At this point, I blew up because I thought it was totally unacceptable that a man who I barely know spent the night in our apartment. The conversation went like this:\n\ngf: god this is barely working im so pissed.\n\ngf: wtf could have happened\n\ngf: the only thing is if Amy's friend Josh who slept on the couch last night accidentally fucked it up somehow\n\nme: What the fuck you\u2019re just gonna have guys stay over at our house and not tell me til afterwards\n\nMe: The first night I\u2019m gone?\n\nme: What the fuck?\n\ngf: Amy was in bed with me?\n\ngf: it was both of them?\n\ngf: josh is just Amy's friend you met them the other day\n\ngf: why does it matter if Amy's friend is sleeping on the couch cuz they dont want to drive drunk?\n\nMy position: If a man who neither of us knows well at all is going to spend the night at our apartment, she should tell me about it. She had been messaging me earlier, we talked earlier (over Facebook), and she left her computer on the coffee table in the living room where they were hanging out. I don't think it seems like that much work to just open her computer and let me know that he is spending the night. 30 seconds. I had no clue anyone spent the night last night. Then she nonchalantly mentions that Josh spent the night. There was no mention of Amy sleeping over previously. Then she immediately minimizes it (I was with Amy, josh is just Amy's friend, why does it matter?).\n\nHer position: I'm being controlling. She says I am like an overprotective father, and that I want her to get my permission before she does anything.\n\nHow I could be the asshole: She is allowed to make decisions on her own, and she doesn't need to let me know everything she does. She didn't hide it from me because she mentioned it the next day. I put her on the defensive by being so aggressive with my \"what the fuck\" response.\n\nFinally, I want to be clear that I have no problem with drunk people staying on our couch. It's hospitable and is a good way to prevent drunk drivers.", "created_utc": 1694224840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dt83b/aita_guy_slept_in_our_apt_wo_my_knowledge/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The way she casually mentioned it to you with no context would have set me off too. I don't know your entire relationship, and I don't know how controlling you are, or you aren't. You haven't gone into any details, so I can't elaborate on anything that way.\n\nThe fact that you're gone for a month, and just the FIRST night you're gone, your girl, who for some reason has no phone, and now \"oops\", the only thing she can actually communicate with you on is now broken too (nice coincidence), and she uses her friends phone to message you and just casually explained that the first night you were gone, that another dude you met once has already slept at your apartment...\n\nThere's SO many ways to hide lies and that's one of them. Let the lie hang out in the open with plausible deniability. \"Well, she told you right away so she couldn't have lied about anything\". Really? That's the oldest trick in the book. How often do girls and guys start talking about particular co workers that are funny etc etc WHILST actually cheating on their significant other. It just seems innocent or a remark so it gets ignored and isn't picked up until later.\n\nDamn right I would be pissed. I think all those things make your reaction justifiable. She should be apologizing to you because when you add up it all up : 1 - No Phone. 2 - Only device she can contact you on coincidentally happens to just break. 3 - With zero context explains a guy slept on the couch the first night you're gone... 4 - You're gone for an entire month and now literally one day after, \"oopsie we can't talk anymore I'm so mad grrrr\". Yeah, something stinks here bro.\n\nI think some of these people are gaslighting you to be honest. They're so focused on her and nobody here that I've read so far has cared about your feelings here, or the implications of what could be happening.", "Gonna go the unpopular route and say NTA. Maybe blowing up on her was a bit much, but if I found out some strangers(to me) stayed in my house without my knowledge, it would make me freak out too. Especially when she automatically assumed the guy broke her computer. He's been there one night and already possibly broken an important/expensive item? I would definitely start freaking out at that. It's also not like he was wanting her to ask for permission. He just wanted a heads-up before some randos slept in his place.", "YTA. You really think if she'd been cheating she would've told you that he was there? And is a man sleeping on the couch in a different room really such a threat to your relationship/manhood? You need to learn to trust her, rather than acting like a dog who's marked their territory and barks whenever another dog comes near.", "NTA dont know what these other people are thinking but in a year from now when you hear he had sex with both ur girl and his girl at the same time youll be like shit i shoulda listened to this guy on reddit lol\n\nAnd if you share a apartment with ur girl then you have every right to get mad and put you foot down. When your in a relationship theres always going to be some level of control that has to happen from both sides. Dont give in to these people on here saying your controlling when they are probably single sluts.", "NTA but you both need to do better with communication.", "NTA In my opinion just because it wouldn't have taken much effort to let you know as you said via a quick Facebook message or maybe if Amy has a phone she could text you on your gf's behalf. When your gf brought up Josh, she skipped over Amy being there too even if by accident it's hard not to worry since it's your space as well. You guys should establish a boundary of if someone else is staying over Amy or whoever and one of you is away that you let the other person know using whatever means. I would tell ur gf if it was you that brought a girl over without her knowing she might feel just as uncomfortable as you did. This whole thing is based on lack of communication, but I hope you guys can make that conclusion together and agree on what to do going forward.", "Nta, I imagine this is a clear no no in your relationship.

There are a few layers so I will discuss each separately.\n\n1. She should have told you about both Amy and Josh. It is a matter of respect. I always tell my roommates if I were to have a friend or family member sleep over (this being in college off campus apartment, after college while working). The home is a shared private space and if there is someone outside that coming to stay over, you should tell the other people who also share that space.  \n   1. a.  I understand the drunk situation, I've let a few drunk friends crash at my couch before too, but I always let my roommates know. If they are not okay with it, I respect that and find an alternative, like putting them up in a hotel nearby or see if another friend can take them.\n   2. b. regarding the no phone, she has fb messenger, and many other means to let OP know, she should have. It doesn't take long to give a heads up.\n\nTo this, she needs to understand that this is not to control her, but it is just a matter of being respectful of the other person who is sharing the same home as you. It is not asking for permission, but informing the other of what is going on. \n\n1. OP should have been calm when talking with her and the response with anger first is unacceptable as well. She should be your partner and your most trusted ally. Instantly go on an aggression is not okay. OP needs to control his emotion and take a step back before replying. While I understand that there is a lot of emotions, it is your responsibility to not get it out of hand. Remember, this is the person you love. You should not start with an implied accusation. You should calmly assess the whole story first.\n\nOP needs to apologize to gf. She is already feeling overwhelmed and frustrated with the broken computer, and you adding on with the attack is only making everything worse. Be calm, cool and collected.\n\nAnyways, this is only my unqualified opinion so take it as you will.", "I don't think YTA. If it was the opposite, she wouldn't understand.", "NTA.

It's really that simple. You couldn't even be bothered to ask why a guy was there first?\n\nYou are so, so wrong here. If you're not rehearsing your best apology and coming up with countless ways to make it up to her, you might as well do her a favor and call it quits.", "if she was cheating why would she mention him sleeping over?", "If she was cheating, would she just tell that in casual conversation? Use common sense please \ud83d\ude44 YTA", "So... you thought that she was cheating on you, and stupid enough to tell you about it the day after?\n\nHow dumb is this girl, in your opinion?\n\nYou have some serious issues with insecurity. I suggest you work on them before you run her off, because women pick up on that shit. Even the \"dumb\" ones.", "Oh God. Another one.\n\nThat's not what he's worried about anyway. He's only concerned she's cheating on him.\n\nThe fact is it just isn't that big of a deal, and if he had bothered to ask some questions he would have found that out.\n\nGood luck with your girl.", "what the OP means is he was introduced to Josh as Amy\u2019s friend a week ago. When ops gf texted him, she mentioned only Josh and not Amy. so he didnt know Amy was there", "Read what you wrote. Why not something like, \u201chuh? Who\u2019s Josh and why was he on our couch?\u201d", "And if *your phone was broken?*\n\nClearly, they were drunk and she was being nice. She was uncomfortable with the situation. Jumping down her throat is the most insecure way to respond to this situation\n\nIt\u2019s clear she was scared of this situation and you aren\u2019t being supportive", "oh yeah ofc i believe you when u say u r not gonna freak out when u get a casual text saying there was a girl who slept on the couch last night while u r away. and also OP says his gf lies a lot. anyone with a liar is bound to be insecure and gonna definitely freak out on things much smaller than this", "Hey look I know I don't know you so this is probably a little too personal but everything is gonna be alright even if the worst comes to light. Just breathe and relax, it really could be coincidence but don't be naive or reactive. \n\nSociety won't listen to your side nearly as much because 1 A large majority of people barely know how to tie their shoes much less give competent and impartial advice without having an angle due to some personal bias. 2 you're a man, society will never see your side and the responses here spell that out already.\n\nIt's a huge breach of trust to not communicate something like that and you know damn well what was happen if the situation was reversed.\n\nBe safe and look out for yourself brother.", "I recognize ppl might not want to have the f word showing up on something they're reading at work. I know it's unkind language to use w the woman I love but she casually mentioned that a guy slept over with no context\n\nedit: so I don't think it's too bad. I should apologize for it if I am indeed the asshole", "Makes sense, from how you described things it seemed something that regularly happens at your house, but you were referring to college. However you shold negotiate rules with your gf  since it's also her house and be prepared for her to have a different opinion. You are also describing a situation in which she wasn't at ease (alone in the apartment with no working phone) so I wonder how your being away for a month has impacted her. Your discomfort is valid, but it seems that there's more to it than reddit can help you validate (and probably more to the story).", "Tbf I think saying wtf to finding out a guy you barely know stayed over is fair. She should have said both of them stayed. He should have asked more info and got the full picture. Communication is always key and it seems neither did great at it.", "I was legit about to say this, is she was cheating she wouldn\u2019t tell the guy \ud83d\ude2d", "In case the neighbors mention she took a guy home. Has happened to people I know, and I didn't know at the time that Amy was there as well. Honestly, if Amy wasn't there I wouldn't be okay with this under any circumstances. For safety if nothing else. We had each met this man exactly one time.\n\nedit: I should also mention there is a lack of trust in our relationship. She lied to me repeatedly, apologized, then lied again. We are working through it. I am (obviously) in a paranoid state", "Uhuh you go ahead and do what he said just happened see how long your relationship lasts. I dont know anyone that would let something like this fly. Well no decent ppl at least.", "Not hiding it means nothing, in fact that's one of the easiest ways to hide cheating. Combine with the fact that his only way to reach her now, the computer, magically broke the same night, and she doesn't have a phone, AND he's gone for a month.... Like cmon. Connect the dots. That's prime real estate for hiding some dirty shit...", "Like I said, her computer was sitting on the coffee table where they were hanging out. She had been messaging me earlier on her computer. It would have taken 30 seconds to shoot me a msg. If her computer wasn't right there I wouldn't have expected her to let me know", "TIL women share a hive mind, and if one woman in one particular scenario reacts one way, that means every other woman in that scenario will also react the same way.\n\nI'm learning so much today!", ">and I didn't know at the time that Amy was there as well.\n\nYou didn't know because you decided to have a meltdown instead of giving your girlfriend any benefit of being either A. Not a cheater aor B. Not the single dumbest cheater in the history of planet earth.", "Sure. Considering your other responses and the fact that you left this really important context out of your original post, I'll take that with a grain of salt. For all we know you're controlling in other parts of her life as well and your expectations for her are actually unreasonable.\n\nWhatever you're doing to work through it isn't working. I'll say it again: you are wrong and you need to be able to admit that. Certainly to her if not us.", "Then leave. If trust issue will always affect your judgement then just leave. It won't get better after marriage. Or a kid won't fix it. This is a you issue and how you'll handle this", "Let what fly? Let a drunk significant other of a friend sleep on my couch?\n\nWhy exactly is that a problem?", "If you\u2019re going to worry that much, you\u2019re not ready to date. Someone can cheat on you every second they\u2019re out of your line of sight. Even then they can cheat via their phones.", "So just to be clear, despite everyone here saying YTA, you're just going to repeat the same thing over and over?\n\nYou're not doing a very good job of learning from this.", "im just saying its a stretch to call OP an AH. and ik for a fact no one would be calling OP an AH if he were a woman", "Fair enough. I had to edit a lot out of my post to get it under the 3000 character limit. Would have liked to include the full context, tried to limit my post to the details of this situation. \n\nI only mention my paranoid state now because it explains me being worried about her cheating. I think that without this context I do seem paranoid and controlling. Of course, you have no way of knowing whether this is true. I'm just trying to add context to get the best advice out of this. Thanks for replying", "When you share a apartment with someone and they dont know that person yea theres unspoken boundaries that are set in relationships and thats usually one of them.", "Unspoken boundaries? That'll go well with whoever you live with.\n\nI really think you're missing the point. He overreacted because he thought she was cheating on him with the guy, and then he got upset when she took offense. If you were to really read my original post, I explained how he could have handled it better (you called it immature) by actually communicating (like an adult) in the future- asking to be notified the next time something like that happens.\n\nHe's not worried about his stuff. He's not worried about her safety. He's just insecure. I'd actually agree with you if it were about those other things."]}
