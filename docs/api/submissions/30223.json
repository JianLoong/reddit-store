I had just gotten home from work and the kids bathroom was a mess (my oldest left her hair extensions, a flat iron, and some other hair stuff on the counter), my middle didn't take out the trash or walk the dog like she said she would (she \"forgot\") and there were dishes left in the sink (apparently they were going to do them when the got home but I don't understand why they couldn't have washed the dishes when they put them in the sink.

I told the kids I will not be cooking or buying food for them anymore until their behavior changes and they stop living like pigs. \n\nSince I said that, I've noticed some concerning behaviors in my youngest. She became a bit more clingy, she made sure to say I love you every time she talked to me, and I see her lights on extremely late at night (she's usually in bed by 10). She's also in her room a lot more than usual. My other kids are saying she's not eating and I can tell she's lost some weight. She's also been hoarding food in her room and I've gotten emails from her teachers (she's in high school) saying that she's always sleeping or crying in their classes and that she hasn't turned in any work for the past 2 weeks. Her behaviors around the house have not changed though so I haven't started cooking for her or bought any food for the house. \n\nShe broke down crying earlier because she thinks I hate her then she locked herself in her room again. My oldest asked if I was going to take care of it and I told her they all knew what they needed to do. She called me \"fucking evil\" and stormed out.

I can only think .. who sets that example for them ? Your husband needs to be supporting you but sounds like he\u2019s setting a bad example & isolating you. The more he continues to act that way, while you\u2019re the only one trying to make things work, the more the children will see your point as unimportant. He needs to be on your side.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to suggest other than family counselling because you must have tried everything for you to resort to withholding care in the efforts of being heard, helped, and appreciated. Which is not healthy.\n\nSide note. Your children are grown. They\u2019re adults actually, and you\u2019re telling me they can\u2019t cook or go out shopping if you give them money ? They\u2019re adults waiting to be cooked for every single day and throwing tantrums when it doesn\u2019t happen. God this is awful", "NTA they\u2019re really not kids anymore. They should be able to handle cleaning up after themselves and even cooking for themselves. These are basic life skills. Seems like they\u2019re also trying manipulate you and guilt you into doing everything for them. The same goes for your husband.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should give in to these tactics. Why not treat yourself to a nice little vacation instead?", "So NTA for drawing a boundary but your youngest is clearly having issues of some kind. She might be legally an adult but she\u2019s also still in high school and not ready to be just a roommate. \n\nSince her siblings have spoken to you about it, and it sounds like the two oldest are the only ones you have concrete complaints against, it might be a good idea to revisit the situation and revise expectations based on age and capability. You don\u2019t have to treat your children equally, but equitably. And you don\u2019t have to punish her for the failings of others. This isn\u2019t bootcamp where everyone has to do push-ups because one person screws up. It\u2019s life.", "NTA (mostly):\n\nI suspect OPs youngest daughter feels guilty about how they have treated their mother and now doesn't know how to deal with it. The other one is doing classic gaslighting. \"You called me up on my BS behaviour and I don't like it so I will turn it around on you.\"\n\nIf I was OP I would explain to the youngest that I love them and always will but cannot continue to live how they have been treating me. That things need to change. Maybe offer to cook some meals with her if she helps and cleans too.\n\nWhy YTA a bit:\n\nI do agree that not buying basic groceries for the  youngest who is still in high-school is a bit of an asshole move. Even if it is not meals and cooking. The older two can get jobs (if they don't already) and provide for themselves. Clearly your youngest is struggling and needs some support with her mental health.", "Your husband was a slob before y\u2019all had kids, got married, and dated. This isn\u2019t new.\n\nYour kids however are grown? Like? I\u2019m 23. That\u2019s just pure spiteful bullshit they\u2019re doing.\n\nHonestly. You simply not cooking is reasonable. Now not buying groceries is a little wild. I would buy ingredients, pantry staples, fruits and veggies. But no snacks/junk foods, or sodas, juices.\n\nAt the very least though. They can clean up. They\u2019ve only gotten this way because they\u2019ve been duly enabled by their parents (i.e. you & your husband).\n\nThey can all tough it out. Really. Like. They would lose it if rats and roaches started crawling around. It\u2019s not hard to do bare minimum cleaning. \n\nYou\u2019re just the teeniest, softest, mostly justified, with a minor exception AH. :) So technically\u2026 NTA ;)", "NTA. My 15 year old is capable of buying groceries and cooking for herself and she often does because she enjoys it. Where the hell is your husband in all of this??? Why can\u2019t HE help the children (mostly the youngest, the others can figure it out) with cooking or groceries ?", "NTA, legally these kids are all adults. Ok, the one in high school still needs to be at home. The oldest is free to move out if she doesn't like what is happening, instead of trying to get the rest of the family to guilt you into cleaning up after them again.\n\nEdited to add, your husband is perfectly capable of buying food. That isn't your sole responsibility", "ESH - The fact that you want your children and husband to do their part in cleaning is understandable. The mistake on your part, in my opinion, is that you are dismissing your youngest daughter\u2019s feelings. Her reaction and behavior in school makes me think there is something more serious troubling her than just your decision to not buy and cook food. And it just seems like your mentality is so focused on getting the kids to do what you want, that you don\u2019t care about what problem your daughter may be going through.", "okay even the one in high school is technically an adult, why can't they cook for themselves?\n\nMind, if you haven't bothered to teach them and only went nuclear after20 plus year then you have to take some of the responsibility for not teaching them before now.\n\nHowever, your youngest daughter sounds like she has serious problems and you should get her checked out by doctor and likely also some sort of therapist.\n\nSo if you don't get your daughter help, you're an AH, but NTA for not cooking for people who can't take their share of household on their shoulders.", "ESH \n\nYour youngest sounds like she needs therapy and might be developing an ED, which is why I NEVER advocate using food as a reward or a punishment \n\nThat being said \n\nYour kids are adults \n\nYou laid out what was happening, why it was bothering you, and how to fix it\n\nI do think the fact that your youngest is still in high school does make it a bit worse, because she's never even had a chance to be on her own \n\nNever lived in a dorm, or even been given the opportunity to\n\nThat's why my vote is E S H and N T A like I was originally leaning\n\nYour youngest is still dependent on you, in every sense except the fact that she is (legally) considered an adult, and I would seriously look into getting her therapy\n\nHer reaction (hoarding food, while simultaneously losing weight) is worrying imo", "NTA- all of your kids are technically adults and should know by now what respect looks like. Also can't they cook for themselves?", "These children are adults. I would be telling the 2 older ones to move out. The youngest is still old enough to help. She sounds like she is playing you. Honestly, you should have put your foot down a lot sooner.", "First of all, your oldest is 21 so if she\u2019s really concerned about your youngest then she should go buy groceries. Second, YOU HAVE A HUSBAND WHY IN THE WORLD ARE THEY ONLY RELYING ON YOU???? He can\u2019t go out and buy groceries?????? Is he useless? Clearly he is, but maybe point out to ALL of them that they are all more than capable of getting their own food at this point. NTA and I\u2019m sorry your family is being absolutely horrible to you. I would suggest having the 18 start therapy though. They can\u2019t be victims forever.", "Sorry this is happening OP, mothers are often so mistreated and carry the burden/weight of the family. It\u2019s crazy how your child is saying you\u2019re evil and not seeing their own errors. I think you need to address the issues with your youngest, clearly something deeper is going on there and in general it seems. If they\u2019re this lazy and inconsiderate, I\u2019m sorry to say it but maybe you raised them to be that way? Too comfortable and spoiled. Also with your husband sounds like you got 4 kids, he needs to step up but I honestly doubt that he will. The conditions have already been set up for them to slack off and you do all the work. Yall need a family intervention", "NTA. They are adults. Have a long talk with them, set boundaries, and buy food for them. EVERY household I know of has a, \"if I cook you clean\" rule. If they dont clean, you dont cook. I would even consider booting the two olest out so you can focus on the youngest. Good luck.", "ESH,\n\nFor the oldest 2, let them fend for themselves.\n\nFor your youngest, the punishment (of no food) doesn't fit the situation.  I think she's depressed and I too am a teacher so I would be concerned.  This might be traumatic for her and her brain is not processing it very well.\n\nDoes she have money to go and buy food for herself?  Does she have a ride?  If she is depressed, I don't think she going to have the motivation or will power to cook, clean, take care of anything.  Something needs to change and she's not going to change in this current setup.  Maybe you can help her by cooking with her or cleaning up with her.  Sometimes it helps a lot to do something together.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome other things you can do for your daughter, take her to the doctor or counselling.  Is she going to fail high school at this rate?  Is she going to self harm? \n\nHave you talked to your daughter about what her issues are?  Don't repeat the you don't do this so I won't feed you line.  THAT ISN'T GOING TO WORK SINCE IT HASN'T.\n\nAsk her what you two can do together to help her get better.   \n\nSide note, why isn't your husband cooking?", "ESH. They're adults, they can make their own meals and clean up after themselves. However, taking away their FOOD is NOT the right punishment. Stop cooking for them for sure, but keep groceries in the fridge.", "NTA for not cooking. Does your husband live with you? Why haven't your kids learned to cook? Or your husband? I could cook whole meals by 14. My dad sometimes cooked and he was born in 1923. If mom was working, we cooked or else we went hungry. Betty Crocker was my best friend back then. LOL Anyway, it sounds like your youngest is taking all of this really hard. I understand your frustration but maybe you can make preparing meals a family thing that you all do together?", "There is a reason I started teaching my boys to cook in their tweens, hell if. Am sending them out into the world\nTo have an excuse expectation of someone else taking care in f them.  Same\nGoes for laundry Ect.", "Why aren't you talking to your youngest about what's going with her? If you've noticed concerning behaviour and her teachers were worried enough to call you, don't you think you should at least try to figure out what's happening?", "ESH. Your children are grown enough to start looking after themselves. Maybe introducing an agreed rota and agreeing a set of realistic rules with the children would help them understand better what to do. Everyone has a different level of tolerance, but dishes in the sink aren\u2019t terrible from my perspective if they\u2019re washed before a certain time. \n\nYou\u2019re perfectly entitled not to cook. But even though your youngest is technically an adult you should be more interested in understanding what is happening with her. She sounds vulnerable and may be having a mental health crisis which is totally unrelated to your cooking or not. She seems to be reaching out for affection from you and it\u2019s not clear if you\u2019re denying it. For some people, denying affection is worse than a smack. \n\nIf you can\u2019t bring yourself to show affection to a daughter who is not meeting your cleaning expectations, at least try to get her some external help. \n\nIf she\u2019s still in school and no food has been bought for the house, does she have the means to feed herself some other way? If not, you\u2019re an AH. There is teaching a lesson and going nuclear. You seem to have gone nuclear.", "NTA but you should've done this years ago.  Better late than never.  They need to learn they can't get by with that stuff.  Food being cooked for them is a reasonable incentive.  In fact, it's a delightful luxury!

Yes. Are you still an asshole? Also yes.\n\nIt sounds like you prefer strong arming and manipulation as a coping mechanism. Your behavior is modeling to your youngest that when Mom gets mad she will be withholding.\n\nThe kind of person that does this probably is also verbally abusive. I\u2019m reading between the lines but I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re emotionally abusive. Additionally, you seem to be more concerned about being right than your youngest daughter\u2019s wellbeing. Why did it take the siblings to point out to you she isn\u2019t doing well? Conversely, usually depressed kids keep messy rooms. Are you creating the very problem that you\u2019re punishing them for? \n\nThe TL;DR is you sound like a miserable person to live with and therefore YTA.", "Yta. You're killing your daughter.", "YTA\u2026you starved your high school aged daughter", "ESH.\n\nYour older kids have graduated and are abusing you and taking advantage.
