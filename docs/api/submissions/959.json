We're also new parents to our little boy who is three months old. During the beginning of the party, my wife was away at the shops looking for some olives because for some reason, they were all out almost everywhere we checked. \n\nMy son has a pretty funny and chaotic birth story. During labour, I got kicked out of the room for around fifteen minutes. Before you guys come at me with pitchforks, let me explain. My wife was labouring and her mother and myself were her birthing partners. I went to use the bathroom quickly and came back, and my wife who was obviously in a foul mood (who wouldn't be) asked me if I enjoyed walking around while she couldn't get up. Obviously, I took no offence because she literally giving birth, so I apologised. She then said 'i don't want your apology, you did this to me' and I made the fatal mistake of chuckling. I immediately got kicked out by her while my MIL laughed her head off. I went to get a slushie for her (approved by the doctor) and I ran into a laughing nurse who was looking for me (sent by my wife) on the way back. When I got back to the room, I gave her the slushie and she was happy. \n\nAt the party, before my wife returned, my friend asked me to tell his wife, Molly, the story. His wife is eight months pregnant and the thought of labour is stressing her out a lot, so my buddy wanted her to hear a light hearted labour story to ease her fears. I told the story and we all had a chuckle, except for another friend's wife, Cassandra. She did not find it funny, and immediately started to berate me for 'making a joke out of my wife's pain'. I tried to clarify that I was not making a joke out of my wife, but in fact the situation as a whole because let's be honest, it was a funny situation. She continued to insist I was making it all about myself so when my wife got back, she clarified that she also found the story funny and she wasn't angry with me for sharing it. Cassandra was not happy with my wife's response and she kept insisting it wasn't my story to tell. I was kinda annoyed at this point, so I told Cassandra that it wasn't our fault she had no sense of humour. She was extremely offended by this, so she left the lunch party, taking my friend with her. He is now insisting that I apologise to her because her intentions were pure (advocating for my wife who made it clear that she was fine). I refused and he called me an asshole. AITA?\n\nEdit: Cassandra, the one who had the problem is not pregnant.

She got worked up and took offense - ostensibly on behalf of your wife, even if your wife herself was fine with it.\n\nMaybe you didn't need to go all the way and say she has no sense of humor, but I understand the feeling. If she didn't find the story funny, she could just not laugh, but it seems she got some issues that were triggered by your story.\n\nYour friend is an AH for calling you AH though. So it seems like they are a good match for each other.", "NTA. Apologise to your friend for not apologising to Cassandra, to complete the circle. It is a funny story by the way.", "NTA. They were pushing for a fight - assuming you told the story as it happened, your wife condoned you telling the story, so Cassandra is actually being a proper AH for effectively telling your wife to not allow you to tell the story she allowed you to tell?", "NTA\n\nIt was funny story.

Easiest thing to do, would be apologizing. She's pregnant, full of hormones and, you've said it yourself, anxious. Even if her sense of humour is usually impeccable, fear screws with that. Your friend, on the other hand, is being a dutiful husband, at the expense of being a friend. Again, first time father, hubby to an anxious soon to be mommy. Cut them some slack. Apologize and avoid joking with them, at least for a while and about this subject matter.", "[deleted]", "NTA, probably simplest to apologize but I do see your frustration as warranted. Cassandra was way out of line to police anyone else's experience in that way; the good news is I suppose your friend will get tired of such self-righteous earnestness very quickly and probably address it privately himself.", "NTA, the first rule of being a guest is not to police people in their own homes jfc \n\nThat said you were sort of rude but I don\u2019t think it was undeserved and certainly not unprompted, she was correcting you both in your own home and not dropping it, so you are entitled to be rude IN YOUR OWN HOME in response.", "NTA\n\nYour wife found the story funny and wasn't angry at you at all.\n\nShe got angry because she believes that your wife would get mad at you for making a joke about her pain when you only joke about you being kicked out by her because you chuckle. She even got more mad when she found out that your wife wasn't mad which probably made her embarrassed that she use the \"its not your story to tell\" card. I believe your wife is ok with you sharing it as she thinks its funny also.  \n\nNo need to apologize", "how come?", "Yes it is. Obviously even OP's wife thinks so. It's not roaringly hilarious but it's a cute anecdote to come out of a birthing experience.", "Cassandra isn't pregnant. Molly is", "Molly is the pregnant one. Cassandra is not", "You went to the toilet, came back, said something to your wife, she got angry and made you leave, then you came back with a slushie? Sorry my dude, but this is not as funny as you think it is.", "Oooh, my bad, you're right! I suck with names, and mixed them up. Doubly NTA, if the lady was offended for its own sake, yeah, different beast altogether.", "Oh, in that case I rescind my judgement. NTA.", "\"you did this to me\" is objectively funny. Go wait outside with Cassandra.", "So you too have no sense of humour. Good to know", "Oh, I did, too. Lol.", "NTA. Here's a funny labour story for you to tell your friend's wife.\n\nMy mum was in labour with me. From the stories, I was a 'catcher's mitt' baby. Apparently, I didn't want to wait for the epidural to kick in. So, my mum is labouring. My dad's being \"helpful\" (how helpful depends on who you ask). My mum got asked if she wanted music playing to help her relax and distract her from the pain of childbirth. My mum said yes.\n\nShe immediately regretted it when the \"music\" started playing. The staff decided that whale music would be relaxing. It may be relaxing at a beautician. But not so much when you're in labour. At least, for my mother. For, as my mother frequently says when telling this story, only male whales sing. (We've never been told otherwise.)\n\nAgain, how loudly my mother yelled depends on who you asked. My dad would say they heard her three rooms down. My mum would say otherwise. But the general consensus? She yelled, \"WHAT'S THAT \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* CRAP?!\" She was mid-contraction and let's just say she did not find it relaxing.\n\nFortunately, my mother didn't have to put up with it for much longer. They turned it off as soon as she yelled. She also added, \"THAT'S NOT \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* MUSIC!\"\n\nAnother reason? They had to look for the catcher's mitt. Like I said, I didn't want to wait long.", "NTA, Cassandra made the whole thing about HER by being such a self righteous jerk.", "Cassandra sounds like a total pain in the ass. Don't apologise and if you're lucky she won't be back. NTA.", "You forgot \u201cin my opinion.\u201d", "This is reddit. Doing something to \"keep the peace\" is tantamount to a war crime.", "I would bet a lot of women threaten to never let their husband touch them again or blame them for the pain in the throws of labor. Doing the deed does not seem worth it when you are pushing an entire human out of your body.", "And at least he had the big brain play to come back with a gift. Even when she kicked him out he was still thinking how he can help her."]}
