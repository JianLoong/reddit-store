{"id": 22146, "submission_id": "14yuwd4", "title": "AITA for kicking my friend out for the comments he made about my girlfriend while drunk?", "selftext": "So, I'm a 21/M. my girlfriend Ella (21/F) and I have been together for 5 years and recently bought a place and moved in together. I have a few friends who are around the same age as me, but the one mentioned in the title we'll call Caleb (21/M)\n\nLast night, we had a housewarming party and invited a few friends over. I had invited Caleb and two other friends that I knew from high school, and Ella invited a few work friends. Of course some drinks were had, but none of us, except for Caleb, drank more than one or two beers. \n\nAfter the night progressed, Caleb started making comments about Ella and her looks. I admit, she is a very pretty woman and always has been. Caleb started commenting on her clothing, when she wasn't wearing anything revealing, just a skirt that was just above her knees and a long sleeved sweater. He started asking things like how I \"managed to score someone like her\". I told him to cut it out, and he seemed to do so for a while.\n\nI'm not sure if its relevant, but the way Ella and I met as kids was because of behavioral problems after her mother passed. She said that I was the first person who willingly decided to be around her since it happened. So I don't know if I see it as \"scoring\".\n\nAbout an hour later, Caleb's comments about Ella started up again. He was talking about how short she was, but then started commenting on her body. I quietly snapped at him to stop, and even the other guys were telling him that its going to far. It seemed that Ella heard his comments, because she went upstairs and changed into longer pants (Her sweater was pretty long already). When she came downstairs, I was pissed. Caleb had made her so uncomfortable in her own house that she felt like she needed to change. \n\nWhile using choice words, I kicked him out of our house. His girlfriend came to pick him up and the party didn't last much longer. Ella later came to me and apologized for the touble she caused and how she was dressed, and I told her that neither her or her clothes were the problem, it was Caleb's sick comments. The next morning, Caleb's girlfriend called me asking what happened and after explaining, she was horrified. Caleb had told her that Ella was coming onto him and I got mad. \n\nCaleb later told me I was an asshole for telling his girlfriend and kicking him out, since apparently his girlfriend is rethinking their relationship. The guys are on my side, but a few of Caleb's family members are telling me that I should get Ella and her slutty clothing in check. Idk if I'm an AH for doing what I did, but with so many people are calling me one I decided to ask you guys.

They're awful.", "NTA\n\nAnd Ella's clothing is fine, Caleb's family should get his slutty mind in check.", "NTA You did the right thing and stuck up for your girlfriend, she should be allowed to wear whatever she wants, ESPECIALLY in her own house. Caleb is gross- get rid of him, if those thoughts come out while he's drunk, I'm sure he's already thinking them sober. You did a great boyfriend move, always protect your girlfriend from weird wack ass men like Caleb.", "NTA, and I'd drop Caleb.  If his family is commenting about \"slutty clothing\" then he went home and said some pretty awful things about her, likely to attempt to blame her for his behavior.  Good for you for sticking up for your GF and for making sure she knew that you didn't see her as the problem.", "So NTA. You did the right thing. You had her back and kicked the AH out of the house.

Caleb isn't only a gross, sexist pervert but also a little baby who cries to his family when his actions have consequence. How pathetic.\nI'm proud of you for standing up for your girlfriend!", "NTA but maybe stop associating with Caleb. His family deeming it your girlfriend's responsibility to keep his behavior in check is super gross. But him thinking is okay to spread lies about your partner coming on to him to cover up for his behavior shows he definitely knew what he did was wrong but doesn't respect her enough to care. If he'll lie about that, you can't really trust anything else he'll say in future anyway. Next time, it might be you he tries to lie to about your girlfriend \"coming on to him\" just out of spite. \n\nI am proud of you for standing up for your girlfriend and for reassuring her that she's not responsible for his behavior. A lot of women dont hear that enough,  especially from men that they respect. It'll go a long way in the future towards preventing her from blaming herself if ever something happens again. Society tends to teach women the lie that they need to fit certain criteria or they're the cause of men's behavior, but it's wonderful to hear you're helping her unlearn that.  You two sound wonderful for each other.", "NTA get rid of caleb and his ..........family. clear to see where he learned the behaviour.\n\nYou stood up for gf while caleb was being a giant p.o.s!\n\nYour a great guy.

I guarantee Ella will remember you having her back. \n\nA few years ago, my husband and I were drinking with a friend of his, and the friend teased me about something or other (I don't remember what it was, but it was pretty mild). My husband immediately sat upright and said \"if you ever talk to her like that again, I'll kick your ass.\" I talked him down because we had just been joking around (and we were all tipsy by this point) but I still really appreciate that he was willing to step up when he thought I was being disrespected.\n\nAn ex of mine once stood idly by while a friend of a friend made a gross comment about my chest within ten seconds of meeting him.

Yikes. \n\nHe was out of line from the start and then the doubled down by slut shaming and lying? His GF may be rethinking things because of him and how he is, not because of anything you said to her. Clearly he knows he's problematic, too, if he wants to blame you for his actions.

This guy is dangerous. If you hadn't been there he would have used more than his words to make Ella feel uncomfortable. It's good you and your other male friends let Caleb know his behaviour isn't acceptable in your social circle. What Caleb's family is doing, saying Ella was asking for it by wearing everyday clothes, is unfortunately the reaction most men have when their friends treat women this way. If you and your friends had shared Celebs attitude, than Caleb would have escalated his behaviour from words to actions. Why hand Caleb the opportunity to do so?\n\n\nIt speaks volumes that Caleb told his girlfriend Ella came onto him and she called you to calmly ask what happened. Sometime who believed her boyfriend is an honest and trustworthy person wouldn't have done that. Would you have doubted Ella? His girlfriend immediately believed your POV over her boyfriends. It's fair to assume this is isn't the first red flag she's noticed. And what she's seen of his behaviour accumulated into that gut feeling of needing to verify his story. If his girlfriend wants out, that means this was the last straw and she no longer feels safe or respected with Caleb. Why should you feel bad your honesty contributed to that? NTA", "NTA OP.

You absolutely did the right thing and I\u2019m sure your gf appreciates it. Don\u2019t listen to the misogynistic AHs who are ok with a man hitting on and harassing another girl even though he\u2026 *checks notes* already has a gf?

Protect yourselves and eachother from false friends like this.", "Caleb had to get checked. He\u2019s lucky you simply kicked him out. You\u2019re a better man than me.", "NTA. I don't even know why you're questioning if you are or not. Caleb either is a grade AAA asshole with no basic manners or just a nimrod; which begs the question - why are you friends with this person?  She showed too much restraint in my opinion.", "NTA. Kick Caleb to the curb i.e. cut all ties. Who knows what he might try if you aren't around.", "NTA and Caleb is not your friend. You may have helped his gf by opening her eyes to who he really is. Congratulations on your new home.", "Fake. \u201cBought a place\u201d at 21\u2026 lol", "Why would you even have to ask. Even if this situation actually happen the only purpose for posting it is to garner praise. clearly anyone in this situation wouldn\u2019t be the asshole. Like\u2026 are you serious?", "Nta and stop being friends with him", "NTA. I guess Caleb and his entire family like that predatory behavior and misogyny. You\u2019ve already got the right emotions here imo. I\u2019d never hang around this guy again. No means no in all interactions. Pretty simple stuff", "NTA. Caleb is a creep and NOT a friend.", "DEFINITELY NOT THE AH.\n\nYou defended your girlfriend from an obvious creep, who no doubt sounds like someone that could turn into a predator very quickly.\n\nAnyone who defends him is as bad as he is.", "NTA holy shit that last part would end my friendship with him for sure. Him and his family are gross", "NTA. Caleb clearly has the hots for YOUR gf. He has no right to comment on Ella's clothing in any capacity. He decided to be a fucking asshole and now he reaps what he has been sowing.", "NTA. Good job standing up for your girlfriend and protecting her from that type of behavior. Caleb sounds like he doesn\u2019t belong in your life, not just not in your house.", "Send this to Caleb and his family.  \n[What were you wearing - Tracy Ullman](https://youtu.be/51-hepLP8J4) \n\nand show your girlfriend to help her realize that she did nothing wrong. Caleb is just a sexist asshole.\n\nNTA", "NTA\u2014he kept making comments about her, plus he LIED to his own girlfriend about it. She wore clothes. Perfectly reasonable respectable clothes. And even if she wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s her own god damn house. He is 110% the asshole. I hope his girlfriend leaves him and I hope he gets a reality check", "NTA OP ur story of how your met her is so sweet goodness \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. And please note boys and men, THIS is how you do it. You speak up and you ensure consequences for the misogynist (in this instance he\u2019s kicked out of the space). Caleb is gross and not a friend. He\u2019s a pure misogynist and unsafe to be around.", "the fact that you think that her having behavioral issues after her mom passed away means she wasn\u2019t a \u201cscore\u201d ?!?!?! that was enough to make me stop reading. i hope he gave her a lot of attention. YTA\n\ncaleb is also TA, i feel sorry for your girlfriend.", "You're a good partner. Sorry your friend had to ruin your party. NTA. Your friend is and he is a major creep.", ">Caleb had told her that Ella was coming onto him and I got mad.\n\nSo on top of everything else, he lied about it?\n\nCaleb is not your friend, and neither are his family.  Cut them all out of your life.  NTA.", "I'm not sure if it's like this in other countries but in Australia there is a lot of focus on tackling domestic violence and anti-social behaviour at its roots, which is often \"casual\" misogyny. If you have a friend who is saying stuff like \"look at her slutty clothes\" or a parent that excuses their son's poor behaviour towards a girl as \"oh he just *likes* her\" then it should be called out.\n\nWhat you did is perfectly reasonable - and he ignored several very reasonable queues/prompts/warnings to address his behaviour.\n\nGood for you, brother. You're part of the solution and definitely NTA", "NTA - the world needs more men like you calling out toxic comments like Caleb", "The last time someone tried to hit on my wife in front of me (and some friends), I got in front of her, got in his face, and told him\n\n \u201cit\u2019s not gonna happen man\u201d. \n\nhe laughed like it was hilarious and then stopped laughing when he looked around and saw that everyone else there was being really quiet with disgusted looks on their faces. He then proceeded to drunkenly try to make a quick exit and fell down a flight of stairs in front of us. His sister (a friend of mine) and I checked to make sure he wasn\u2019t injured and then we left him to hobble home. She turned to me as he was hobbling down the alleyway and goes \u201cunfortunately he\u2019s my brother\u201d.\n\nWe both laughed.", "NTA. Caleb is not your friend.", "That was the worst part for me as well. This whole post was hard to read, but that bit made me let a groan out so loud, my gf looked up from what she was doing across the room. Wtf man", "Doubt it's his family, he's probably spoofing numbers. What 21 year old tells his family he got kicked out of a party for drunkenly making the hosts uncomfortable with sexual harassment?", "Guess misogyny runs in the family. Gross.", "You can send anyone on messenger a text if you can find them on Facebook or Instagram. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "They've been friends since high school, which is an age you still hang out at the other person's parents house around their parents and siblings. It wouldn't be weird to have each other's family members on social media, or know how to contact them easily.", "Yes - and, you know what? Even if her clothing was sexier, Caleb would still be the AH.", "I would guess it's a small town and they grew up together. I knew a lot of my friends' family members at that age cuz fuck, I swear everyone is related to someone in those small towns. And the rumor mill is alive and well when there's not much else to do", "What about men - Wahhhhhh", "The person who had my phone number before me apparently never notified his family he dropped the number. No matter how many times I answer the phone and explain it is no longer his...still on the family mailing list. At this point, I am about to just celebrate Aunt Louise's birthday and appreciate the random family pictures they send me.", "For real. They've been friends since high school, which is an age you still hang out at the other person's parents house around their  parents and siblings. It wouldn't be weird to have each other's family members on social media already without even having to find them.", "It was the friend's family. Do your friend's family members text you when you and your friend have a fight?", "The whataboutism is expected.", "I think it\u2019s okay to feel sympathy for victims no matter the gender.", "Forreal, its not that hard to get information from people. Chances are if Caleb was willing to throw OP and his GF under the bus, who\u2019s to say he wouldn\u2019t give out a number? Also, instagram? People are able to find others and DM them so easily on there.", "I mean yeah, but it's really weird that we are talking about a woman being sexually harassed and someone randomly brings up how men are too...."]}
