{"id": 22146, "submission_id": "14yuwd4", "title": "AITA for kicking my friend out for the comments he made about my girlfriend while drunk?", "selftext": "So, I'm a 21/M. my girlfriend Ella (21/F) and I have been together for 5 years and recently bought a place and moved in together. I have a few friends who are around the same age as me, but the one mentioned in the title we'll call Caleb (21/M)\n\nLast night, we had a housewarming party and invited a few friends over. I had invited Caleb and two other friends that I knew from high school, and Ella invited a few work friends. Of course some drinks were had, but none of us, except for Caleb, drank more than one or two beers. \n\nAfter the night progressed, Caleb started making comments about Ella and her looks. I admit, she is a very pretty woman and always has been. Caleb started commenting on her clothing, when she wasn't wearing anything revealing, just a skirt that was just above her knees and a long sleeved sweater. He started asking things like how I \"managed to score someone like her\". I told him to cut it out, and he seemed to do so for a while.\n\nI'm not sure if its relevant, but the way Ella and I met as kids was because of behavioral problems after her mother passed. She said that I was the first person who willingly decided to be around her since it happened. So I don't know if I see it as \"scoring\".\n\nAbout an hour later, Caleb's comments about Ella started up again. He was talking about how short she was, but then started commenting on her body. I quietly snapped at him to stop, and even the other guys were telling him that its going to far. It seemed that Ella heard his comments, because she went upstairs and changed into longer pants (Her sweater was pretty long already). When she came downstairs, I was pissed. Caleb had made her so uncomfortable in her own house that she felt like she needed to change. \n\nWhile using choice words, I kicked him out of our house. His girlfriend came to pick him up and the party didn't last much longer. Ella later came to me and apologized for the touble she caused and how she was dressed, and I told her that neither her or her clothes were the problem, it was Caleb's sick comments. The next morning, Caleb's girlfriend called me asking what happened and after explaining, she was horrified. Caleb had told her that Ella was coming onto him and I got mad. \n\nCaleb later told me I was an asshole for telling his girlfriend and kicking him out, since apparently his girlfriend is rethinking their relationship. The guys are on my side, but a few of Caleb's family members are telling me that I should get Ella and her slutty clothing in check. Idk if I'm an AH for doing what I did, but with so many people are calling me one I decided to ask you guys.

They're awful.", "NTA\n\nAnd Ella's clothing is fine, Caleb's family should get his slutty mind in check.", "NTA You did the right thing and stuck up for your girlfriend, she should be allowed to wear whatever she wants, ESPECIALLY in her own house. Caleb is gross- get rid of him, if those thoughts come out while he's drunk, I'm sure he's already thinking them sober. You did a great boyfriend move, always protect your girlfriend from weird wack ass men like Caleb.", "NTA, and I'd drop Caleb.  If his family is commenting about \"slutty clothing\" then he went home and said some pretty awful things about her, likely to attempt to blame her for his behavior.  Good for you for sticking up for your GF and for making sure she knew that you didn't see her as the problem.", "So NTA. You did the right thing. You had her back and kicked the AH out of the house.

Caleb isn't only a gross, sexist pervert but also a little baby who cries to his family when his actions have consequence. How pathetic.\nI'm proud of you for standing up for your girlfriend!", "NTA but maybe stop associating with Caleb. His family deeming it your girlfriend's responsibility to keep his behavior in check is super gross. But him thinking is okay to spread lies about your partner coming on to him to cover up for his behavior shows he definitely knew what he did was wrong but doesn't respect her enough to care. If he'll lie about that, you can't really trust anything else he'll say in future anyway. Next time, it might be you he tries to lie to about your girlfriend \"coming on to him\" just out of spite. \n\nI am proud of you for standing up for your girlfriend and for reassuring her that she's not responsible for his behavior. A lot of women dont hear that enough,  especially from men that they respect. It'll go a long way in the future towards preventing her from blaming herself if ever something happens again. Society tends to teach women the lie that they need to fit certain criteria or they're the cause of men's behavior, but it's wonderful to hear you're helping her unlearn that.  You two sound wonderful for each other.", "NTA get rid of caleb and his ..........family. clear to see where he learned the behaviour.\n\nYou stood up for gf while caleb was being a giant p.o.s!\n\nYour a great guy.

I guarantee Ella will remember you having her back. \n\nA few years ago, my husband and I were drinking with a friend of his, and the friend teased me about something or other (I don't remember what it was, but it was pretty mild). My husband immediately sat upright and said \"if you ever talk to her like that again, I'll kick your ass.\" I talked him down because we had just been joking around (and we were all tipsy by this point) but I still really appreciate that he was willing to step up when he thought I was being disrespected.\n\nAn ex of mine once stood idly by while a friend of a friend made a gross comment about my chest within ten seconds of meeting him.

Yikes. \n\nHe was out of line from the start and then the doubled down by slut shaming and lying? His GF may be rethinking things because of him and how he is, not because of anything you said to her. Clearly he knows he's problematic, too, if he wants to blame you for his actions.

This guy is dangerous. If you hadn't been there he would have used more than his words to make Ella feel uncomfortable. It's good you and your other male friends let Caleb know his behaviour isn't acceptable in your social circle. What Caleb's family is doing, saying Ella was asking for it by wearing everyday clothes, is unfortunately the reaction most men have when their friends treat women this way. If you and your friends had shared Celebs attitude, than Caleb would have escalated his behaviour from words to actions. Why hand Caleb the opportunity to do so?\n\n\nIt speaks volumes that Caleb told his girlfriend Ella came onto him and she called you to calmly ask what happened. Sometime who believed her boyfriend is an honest and trustworthy person wouldn't have done that. Would you have doubted Ella? His girlfriend immediately believed your POV over her boyfriends. It's fair to assume this is isn't the first red flag she's noticed. And what she's seen of his behaviour accumulated into that gut feeling of needing to verify his story. If his girlfriend wants out, that means this was the last straw and she no longer feels safe or respected with Caleb. Why should you feel bad your honesty contributed to that? NTA", "NTA OP.

I hope you (and your other friends) are planning to not associate with Caleb anymore. He was not just rude and obnoxious but he lied about your girlfriend so he would look better. He is a liar and you don\u2019t need him.", "NTA The fact that he made her so uncomfortable she felt like she had to change was gross, I\u2019m glad you kicked him out. He\u2019s pissed because he got called out for his behavior and now he\u2019s having some consequences for them. I\u2019m also glad that your friends also agree that he was out of line with his comments, I think Caleb needs to be removed from the friend group here.", "NTA. I commend you for protecting your girlfriend. No matter what her past is, Caleb's behaviour is unacceptable. You had every right to throw him out, and you should seriously consider even associating with him ever again. His family's whole blame on what she was wearing act is a giant red flag, and you do not need to subject her to that again. \n\nKudos to you for protecting your girlfriend! You show more maturity in your pinky finger than Caleb or his family has.", "NTA. Caleb is a disgusting creep and you\u2019re a wonderful partner. It\u2019s so refreshing to read about a guy who clearly really cares for his gf and sticks up for her in her times of need, especially since so many posts here are about problematic wives/husbands, bfs/gfs and all else in between. You absolutely did the right thing and I\u2019m sure your gf appreciates it. Don\u2019t listen to the misogynistic AHs who are ok with a man hitting on and harassing another girl even though he\u2026 *checks notes* already has a gf? And said girl he was harassing is dating you when you were literally right next to her\u2026 right. He is a total AH and a loser. But at least you now know better than to invite him to a part next time.", "NTA. We\u2019re these family members there? So how do they know she was dressing slutty?  You said she wasn\u2019t. Tell Caleb he made his own problems and he needs to own them", "NTA.  Caleb came into yours and your girlfriend's home and made wildly inappropriate comments about your gf.  He's lucky that all you did was make him leave.", "NTA by a fucking mile. You stood up for your girlfriend -- who did absolutely nothing wrong -- and Caleb is probably trying to cover for the fact that he's jealous of your stable relationship; jealousy that came out once he had too many drinks. Don't give this guy a second thought and let him hang himself.", "NTA. Caleb was way out of line and his family have absolutely NO RIGHT to talk to you about you're relationship or commenting on you're girlfriend. \n\nIt's better to cut them off. If Caleb was willing to lie about what he did and don't even have the decency to apologize but instead put the blame on you I don't think that this relationship is worthy. \n\nI'm sorry about the mistake I'm still learning English", "NTA. Keep in mind that Caleb's family have probably only heard his version of things and their opinion should be ignored. Your GF did nothing wrong and you did everything right. If Caleb doesn't come to his senses in a couple days and apologize and se the story5 straight, I'd cut him out of your life.", "NTA And it's time to remove Caleb from your circle of friends. Not only has he shown you what he really thinks of Ella (\"in vino, veritas\" after all), but he's also lying to his own GF and family about her.\n\nTime to invite him to find new friends.", "NTA NTA - All the other comments are correct - Go you for standing up for your GF over a misogynistic AH. It doesn't matter what she was wearing those comments he made were uncalled for, his GF should def be reconsidering their relationship", "NTA I think you handled this perfectly. Including telling his GF", "NTA. You were a very supportive boyfriend. Awesome job!", "NTA you did the right thing standing up for your lady because you respect her. You handled it the proper way and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.", "I genuinely think that they make this shit up. So many posts talk about how friends and family members text bombed me about how wrong I was (when it is very clear that the OP was not wrong). Like why does your friends mom, dad,  brother, sister, aunt and uncle have your number even to begin with? I just don't believe it. Why would someone out of the situation feel the need to even put in their two cents? I just don't believe it.", "These are the parts of the AITA I kind of don't believe. So you get in an argument with someone, and their like aunt randomly gets their number and texts them theyre the asshole when other person like stole their car ir something. I don't buy it, when has that ever happened in real life?", "Sounds like 'Caleb' decided to tell other people that the clothing she had on was revealing. Probably made it out to seem that she was wearing nothing but a bra and a miniskirt. It sounds to me like Caleb was trying to come up with anything to defend his actions. Of course his family is on his side, either they are shitty people too and contribute to his misogyny, or Caleb simply lied. Both can be true as well, now that I think about it.", "He told his girlfriend and family that op's girlfriend flirted with him, then he got kicked out of the party. Trying to be the victim makes it so much worse.", "I would have simply told his family to eat shit and fuck off. Blaming the girl for her reasonably modest clothing is gross and Caleb is gross for probably lying to them too about the events.", "I guess we know where Caleb gets it from...", "Caleb is a lying drunk AH who was hitting on Ella, who was dressed appropriately and modestly for a party in her own house. Caleb is just throwing her under the bus to try to save his troubled relationship. This is not a friend - he should never darken your door again. NTA", "I think Caleb has managed to get his version out to them. I'd correct them ONCE, and then just forget they exist.", "also, family members? *Which* family members? Why is Caleb telling family members about this, and why do they have contact with OP? When I was 21 I don't think any of my friends' family members knew who I was enough to a) have my contact information b) think commenting on friend-group drama is appropriate at all? It's one thing if the family members are siblings, but the vagueness of \"family members\" has me thinking it's like, Caleb's aunts, uncles, or parents or something, and that's honestly kinda fucking weird?", "You should cut him and his family off completely OP. The fact that he hasn\u2019t apologized tells you all you need to know. He\u2019s an asshole through and through. NTA, but please don\u2019t hang out with Caleb anymore. He showed his true colors.", "I hope my daughter ends up with a man that values her like you do your girlfriend. You defended her and wanted her to have a safe place to call her own. You also want her to unabashedly be herself with no filters necessary.  Cudos. So, NTA, and stay away from that assclown and his enabling goons.", "LITERALLY this is all I could actually focus on while reading. Like how", "He's obviously just jerking himself off about how great of a guy he is, if it even did happen like this", "I feel like someone either meant NTA or misread a line or two of OP's post.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It's the 21st century...  Even if some didn't have my info, all they'd have to do is send an email asking a couple people.  Not hard at all.", "This is genuinely the most braindead comment I've read tonight. Congratulations.", "Maybe you have been lucky to not be surrounded by that kind of drama? I have in the past been messaged by friends of friends to argue about something they have done to justify their actions.", "Many years ago my ex gave all his family members my direct number at work because I had kicked him out and was letting the home phone go the message machine.  I had to have the tech folks replace (rewire?) the phone outlet at my desk to an unused extension so I could work.  Boss was so mad he had his attorney send out certified letters to half a dozen of them threatening to sue for harassment if they didn't cease and desist.  This was in the early 1980's so yes, it does/can happen.  Today I would imagine it is even easier to do - so many different platforms with personal information they can access.  I understand the skepticism, but it is possible, especially among families that believe their little darlings can do no wrong.", "Her choice of outfit is not relevant here. The comments would still be inappropriate", "It's a big wide world out there, people don't all live like you.", "I always think that too. Do people really not realize how pathetic that makes everyone involved look? It's the adult version of taking a parent to school to fight another kid you have beef with.", "> And why do any of the people who post here even ask if they are somehow wrong when all these third parties contact them?\n\nThis is a *thing* on this subreddit in a way I have literally not once experienced in real life, even with people on the peripheral of my social circles, and I'm beginning to wonder if it's some kind of tactic to get a N T A verdict? I mean obviously OP is NTA here, but adding \"also everyone is dog piling me in my DMs, poor me\" to anything could garner some kind of sympathy? I mean, is this behavior actually common amongst full grown adults, and I'm just lucky to have avoided people like this my whole life?", "Agreed. I was thinking to cut him off too! I understand Caleb was under the influence but we say more truthful things like that. And Caleb probably already has a \u201ccrush\u201d on Ella and said those things. \n\nLike you said. Caleb is showing his true colors.", "When someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "I read the title, and the first thing that came to mind was, \ud83c\udfb6 \"somebody wants some karma\" \ud83c\udfb6", "I've had someone I literally never interacted with message me over a massive misunderstanding because friend I was talking to and had the misunderstanding with decided to tell this person what I said. It was weird, and some people can be really petty.", "Yeah but that\u2019s your family, not your friend\u2019s family", "You should probably keep that that shit a little more private.
