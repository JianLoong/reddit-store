{"id": 22146, "submission_id": "14yuwd4", "title": "AITA for kicking my friend out for the comments he made about my girlfriend while drunk?", "selftext": "So, I'm a 21/M. my girlfriend Ella (21/F) and I have been together for 5 years and recently bought a place and moved in together. I have a few friends who are around the same age as me, but the one mentioned in the title we'll call Caleb (21/M)\n\nLast night, we had a housewarming party and invited a few friends over. I had invited Caleb and two other friends that I knew from high school, and Ella invited a few work friends. Of course some drinks were had, but none of us, except for Caleb, drank more than one or two beers. \n\nAfter the night progressed, Caleb started making comments about Ella and her looks. I admit, she is a very pretty woman and always has been. Caleb started commenting on her clothing, when she wasn't wearing anything revealing, just a skirt that was just above her knees and a long sleeved sweater. He started asking things like how I \"managed to score someone like her\". I told him to cut it out, and he seemed to do so for a while.\n\nI'm not sure if its relevant, but the way Ella and I met as kids was because of behavioral problems after her mother passed. She said that I was the first person who willingly decided to be around her since it happened. So I don't know if I see it as \"scoring\".\n\nAbout an hour later, Caleb's comments about Ella started up again. He was talking about how short she was, but then started commenting on her body. I quietly snapped at him to stop, and even the other guys were telling him that its going to far. It seemed that Ella heard his comments, because she went upstairs and changed into longer pants (Her sweater was pretty long already). When she came downstairs, I was pissed. Caleb had made her so uncomfortable in her own house that she felt like she needed to change. \n\nWhile using choice words, I kicked him out of our house. His girlfriend came to pick him up and the party didn't last much longer. Ella later came to me and apologized for the touble she caused and how she was dressed, and I told her that neither her or her clothes were the problem, it was Caleb's sick comments. The next morning, Caleb's girlfriend called me asking what happened and after explaining, she was horrified. Caleb had told her that Ella was coming onto him and I got mad. \n\nCaleb later told me I was an asshole for telling his girlfriend and kicking him out, since apparently his girlfriend is rethinking their relationship. The guys are on my side, but a few of Caleb's family members are telling me that I should get Ella and her slutty clothing in check. Idk if I'm an AH for doing what I did, but with so many people are calling me one I decided to ask you guys.

OP YOU ARE NTA.", "NTA NTA NTA. Absolutely disgusting behavior from Caleb, good on you for defending Ella. Neither of you are in the wrong here. Caleb has shown his true colors and is never going to change. It's time to cut him out of your life.", "Easy NTA.  Ridiculous after reading your narrative.
