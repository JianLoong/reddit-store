{"id": 22146, "submission_id": "14yuwd4", "title": "AITA for kicking my friend out for the comments he made about my girlfriend while drunk?", "selftext": "So, I'm a 21/M. my girlfriend Ella (21/F) and I have been together for 5 years and recently bought a place and moved in together. I have a few friends who are around the same age as me, but the one mentioned in the title we'll call Caleb (21/M)\n\nLast night, we had a housewarming party and invited a few friends over. I had invited Caleb and two other friends that I knew from high school, and Ella invited a few work friends. Of course some drinks were had, but none of us, except for Caleb, drank more than one or two beers. \n\nAfter the night progressed, Caleb started making comments about Ella and her looks. I admit, she is a very pretty woman and always has been. Caleb started commenting on her clothing, when she wasn't wearing anything revealing, just a skirt that was just above her knees and a long sleeved sweater. He started asking things like how I \"managed to score someone like her\". I told him to cut it out, and he seemed to do so for a while.\n\nI'm not sure if its relevant, but the way Ella and I met as kids was because of behavioral problems after her mother passed. She said that I was the first person who willingly decided to be around her since it happened. So I don't know if I see it as \"scoring\".\n\nAbout an hour later, Caleb's comments about Ella started up again. He was talking about how short she was, but then started commenting on her body. I quietly snapped at him to stop, and even the other guys were telling him that its going to far. It seemed that Ella heard his comments, because she went upstairs and changed into longer pants (Her sweater was pretty long already). When she came downstairs, I was pissed. Caleb had made her so uncomfortable in her own house that she felt like she needed to change. \n\nWhile using choice words, I kicked him out of our house. His girlfriend came to pick him up and the party didn't last much longer. Ella later came to me and apologized for the touble she caused and how she was dressed, and I told her that neither her or her clothes were the problem, it was Caleb's sick comments. The next morning, Caleb's girlfriend called me asking what happened and after explaining, she was horrified. Caleb had told her that Ella was coming onto him and I got mad. \n\nCaleb later told me I was an asshole for telling his girlfriend and kicking him out, since apparently his girlfriend is rethinking their relationship. The guys are on my side, but a few of Caleb's family members are telling me that I should get Ella and her slutty clothing in check. Idk if I'm an AH for doing what I did, but with so many people are calling me one I decided to ask you guys.

It's clear where Caleb's prejudice came from.\n\nNTA", "Caleb's family members are on my AH list as well.", "Agree completely, I would never speak to these people again. They're awful.", "NTA\n\nAnd Ella's clothing is fine, Caleb's family should get his slutty mind in check.", "NTA You did the right thing and stuck up for your girlfriend, she should be allowed to wear whatever she wants, ESPECIALLY in her own house. Caleb is gross- get rid of him, if those thoughts come out while he's drunk, I'm sure he's already thinking them sober. You did a great boyfriend move, always protect your girlfriend from weird wack ass men like Caleb.", "NTA, and I'd drop Caleb.  If his family is commenting about \"slutty clothing\" then he went home and said some pretty awful things about her, likely to attempt to blame her for his behavior.  Good for you for sticking up for your GF and for making sure she knew that you didn't see her as the problem.", "So NTA. You did the right thing. You had her back and kicked the AH out of the house. His family's comments show they are just trash people. Hopefully, his GF will clue on and jump ship.", "NTA! Caleb isn't only a gross, sexist pervert but also a little baby who cries to his family when his actions have consequence. How pathetic.\nI'm proud of you for standing up for your girlfriend!", "NTA but maybe stop associating with Caleb. His family deeming it your girlfriend's responsibility to keep his behavior in check is super gross. But him thinking is okay to spread lies about your partner coming on to him to cover up for his behavior shows he definitely knew what he did was wrong but doesn't respect her enough to care. If he'll lie about that, you can't really trust anything else he'll say in future anyway. Next time, it might be you he tries to lie to about your girlfriend \"coming on to him\" just out of spite. \n\nI am proud of you for standing up for your girlfriend and for reassuring her that she's not responsible for his behavior. A lot of women dont hear that enough,  especially from men that they respect. It'll go a long way in the future towards preventing her from blaming herself if ever something happens again. Society tends to teach women the lie that they need to fit certain criteria or they're the cause of men's behavior, but it's wonderful to hear you're helping her unlearn that.  You two sound wonderful for each other.", "NTA get rid of caleb and his ..........family. clear to see where he learned the behaviour.\n\nYou stood up for gf while caleb was being a giant p.o.s!\n\nYour a great guy. Sod them and enjoy your new house with your gf", "The  family members of Caleb were not at the party.  They have been lied to by Caleb.   Don't waster your time on them and their clearly biased opinions.\n\nThe people at your party are on your's and Ella's side.  \n\nI would go NC with Caleb at this point.

You're not.\n\nNTA", "Anyone saying a word about your girl needs to be dropped and forever banned from coming to your house.\n\nThese are the kinds of people who blame the victim and believe the rapists are innocent and helpless. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

Sounds made up.", "YTA for being friends with such an obvious bellend.", "If it pleases The court, counsel would like to view said clothing\u2026", "YTA, but it wouldn't have mattered if your girlfriend was in a bikini, his behavior is on HIM - not her. It's remarkably shallow, self-centered, and misogynistic to think that what women wear makes them responsible for the depravity of men.", "NTA and thank you for doing the right thing. I guarantee Ella will remember you having her back. \n\nA few years ago, my husband and I were drinking with a friend of his, and the friend teased me about something or other (I don't remember what it was, but it was pretty mild). My husband immediately sat upright and said \"if you ever talk to her like that again, I'll kick your ass.\" I talked him down because we had just been joking around (and we were all tipsy by this point) but I still really appreciate that he was willing to step up when he thought I was being disrespected.\n\nAn ex of mine once stood idly by while a friend of a friend made a gross comment about my chest within ten seconds of meeting him. I've never forgotten that either.", "NTA. Good on you standing up for your girlfriend and perfectly normal clothing. I've been walking around in a bikini the past week because we're at the beach and no one has said anything about my body or 'slutty' clothing.\n\nYou were right to tell Ella the truth. Why should she suffer being in a relationship with someone awful?

Yeah, NTA.", "NTA, except you let it go on too long.   \n    \n>  Caleb later told me I was an asshole for telling his girlfriend and kicking him out, since apparently his girlfriend is rethinking their relationship.   \n    \nNo shit, no one wants to be with \"that creepy guy\".", "WTF? No! NTA. Not in the slightest. You\u2019ve done everything right and you\u2019ve acted very admirably.\n\nNTA a million times over.", "I threw up in my mouth a little when I read that last little bit that his family members are saying! I'm sure he told them a completely different story about how she wore slutty clothes and kept flirting with him... Kind of the same story he told his girlfriend, which wasn't true! But the idea that he now has his flying monkeys brainwashed into thinking that your girlfriend did something wrong is insanity at best! Kick him out of the whole friend group! Hopefully his girlfriend dumps him! You are NTA and your girlfriend sounds lovely.", "NTA - you did what was right and he's horrible. I mean, it's your home/her home and she felt that uncomfortable? Yikes. \n\nHe was out of line from the start and then the doubled down by slut shaming and lying? His GF may be rethinking things because of him and how he is, not because of anything you said to her. Clearly he knows he's problematic, too, if he wants to blame you for his actions. If he hadn't said or done those things, there would be no issue.\n\nAnyone who wants to slut shame Ella is someone you need to know is a red flag. That's predatory and problematic behavior and it's how women end up being harmed.", "NTA. Your first instincts were the right ones, and you would be an even better boyfriend (already great!) if you cut out the person who sexually harassed your girlfriend and then demanded it be tolerated out y'all's lives.", "*Rage*\n\nNTA\n\nGet rid of Caleb - he's trash, and if he's being enabled by his family, he may try it again, or something worse.\n\nCat videos for me, then.", "What's stopping you from blocking Caleb's number and social media? This guy is dangerous. If you hadn't been there he would have used more than his words to make Ella feel uncomfortable. It's good you and your other male friends let Caleb know his behaviour isn't acceptable in your social circle. What Caleb's family is doing, saying Ella was asking for it by wearing everyday clothes, is unfortunately the reaction most men have when their friends treat women this way. If you and your friends had shared Celebs attitude, than Caleb would have escalated his behaviour from words to actions. Why hand Caleb the opportunity to do so?\n\n\nIt speaks volumes that Caleb told his girlfriend Ella came onto him and she called you to calmly ask what happened. Sometime who believed her boyfriend is an honest and trustworthy person wouldn't have done that. Would you have doubted Ella? His girlfriend immediately believed your POV over her boyfriends. It's fair to assume this is isn't the first red flag she's noticed. And what she's seen of his behaviour accumulated into that gut feeling of needing to verify his story. If his girlfriend wants out, that means this was the last straw and she no longer feels safe or respected with Caleb. Why should you feel bad your honesty contributed to that? NTA", "NTA OP.  If I were you, I would talk to your girlfriend about going completely no contact with Caleb and his family.  They seem to be jerks.", "NTA. Personally, I wouldn't want someone like Caleb for a friend.", "Finally, a reasonable man with a coincidentally gorgeous woman. Blames the man for the attention and undoes the shame she felt for just being pretty.

Tell Caleb and his familh to fuck off. Make sure your other friends know how youre being treated because of that, so they can steer clear from that shit too.", "Men are predators because they are allowed to be - either coving up for them, or through those stereotypes of comments.

OP literally told the gf that how she dressed wasn\u2019t the problem, Caleb\u2019s behavior was.
