Youre 16 you shouldn\u2019t be expected to spend a minimum of $50 per person. That\u2019s ridiculous.

How did she think you would pay 200+.", "NTA. The thing that bothers me the most about this is the LIST she gave you--and the $50 each minimum expected for presents! You're not Santa, so unless your mom is providing you with the money with which to buy those presents, that's an absolutely ridiculous demand. At 16, you're still technically a child. (Note: I'm not calling you a child in a patronising way, just that very few teenagers have the same income as mature adults.)  The step-siblings are a separate matter, as they're younger children, and it's always kind to get gifts for children--but only spending reasonably within your budget.", "NTA. So she expects you to spend $200 on their little family unit, plus whatever for the rest of your family?\n\nAdditionally, she wants you to buy a present for a person who's treated you poorly, and also for her who up and ignored you for like 2 plus years. Nope, she should just consider herself lucky you didn't decide to ignore her existence forever, and tell her new wife to treat you decently.

Regarding removing the kids from the room? Treating you poorly?", "NTA- Also, I\u2019m a bit concerned as to why your therapist encouraged you, a minor, to reach out to someone so clearly toxic and entitled. If she makes you uncomfortable and acts so terribly, she should be cut out of your life. Inviting toxic people into your life \u201cbecause family\u201d seems a bit\u2026naive.

Regardless of the sexualities involved, your mom's wife was involved in breaking up their marriage.  Mom needed to end one relationship, cleanly, with a minimum of hostility, before getting involved with someone else.  On a 16-year old's budget, $200 worth of gifts is over the top.  THEY have a $50 minimum.  Nothing obligates you to work with the same minimum.  Mom's wife was rude to you, but your mother sees nothing wrong with her partner's behavior, which is in keeping with her apparent inability to recognize her own bad behavior (again, it's not about sexualities, just about how to handle the end of a relationship when she's the one ending it).\n\nI get that your therapist wanted you to make an effort to salvage some kind of relationship with her.  Now you can honestly tell yourself you tried.  Show your therapist the messages you've received.  I have a feeling your therapist will think it's a good idea to go NC.  As far as your friends are concerned, they need to invite themselves out of the conversation.  Nothing says you have to put up with their continuing bad behavior.  Your mom really isn't much of a mom and until she makes a great deal more effort than she's making now, nothing says she has to be part of your family.  Nothing says you ever have to put up with her wife's bad behavior, either.", "NTA  - Your mom is an immoral mess.
