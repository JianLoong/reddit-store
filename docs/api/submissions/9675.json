Kids at school make fun of her. We have brought this up to the school, but they do nothing. We have actually requested her to an alternative then gym class because the girls in the locker rooms would take pictures or gang up on her.

At a time when your daughter just needed comforted and supported you piled on more. \n\nI understand that you were trying to \"fix\" the problem (lots of guys, my husband included go straight to fox it mode) but that was not the right time.\n\nTry sitting down with her and let her know that you support her and that what those kids did was terrible. Also tell her that you realize what you said came across to her as piling more crap on an already upsetting situation and that it wasn't your intent. \n\nThen LISTEN to her without trying to \"fix\". See what she wants to do. Give her some healthy options (and make sure that it is focused on HEALTH not weight) and let her pick what/if she wants to go to the gym or run or anything like that.\n\nBefore becoming a SAHM I used to work with bariatric/healthy weight clinic at a rather large children's hospital. We saw patients from ages 4 to 21, some of whom after completing the healthy weight portion of the program went on to get bariatric surgery. You can eat healthy foods at large portions and gain weight. You can gain weight due to health issues (hormonal imbalance, etc). When I worked there all of our patients met with a doctor, dietician, physical therapist and a psychologist. Have her see a therapist and mental health is often linked to weight, even when you don't realize it.\n\nDon't push the exercise and especially don't push it for weightloss and single her out. Maybe see if everyone, her included, are interested in doing family walks in the evenings (walks not runs, she needs to start slow so she doesn't injure herself). If everyone doesn't want to right now then don't force it but make it about bonding as a family and not her losing weight. But only if she wants to don't make her. She may decide to join you all later if the rest of you are doing this together.\n\nBut please please please sit down with her and talk to her. Don't let her continue to think that you think she is fat or that you are pushing her to change. She needs love and patience and support right now. She could be thinking that you agree with what those kids did because you too think she is fat. Tell her you love her and LISTEN to what she has to say\n\nSorry if this jumped around a bit...problems of ADHD and trying to give a lot of info. Haha. Good luck dad. You got this...and so does she\n\nEditing to add judgment: a soft YTA. You meant well but terrible timing and made things worse", "YTA\n\nNot for what you said. But because your daughter had just been obliterated by a very traumatic event. It wasn't the time to talk about her weight or losing weight. She should have been given time to process.\n\nI don't feel you were fat shaming or anything of that sort and I certainly think an apology would go a long way once she's had time to process.", "I was a fat little girl, too. My father would have these talks with me about my weight, too. He meant well, too. It still did a lot of damage because he unintentionally made me feel like it was my fault I was fat. I was 9, 10, 12 years old - what did I know about being healthy or losing weight in a healthy way? I ate the same foods and had about the same amount of exercise as my older brother and my friends, but they were all skinnier than me. I didn\u2019t understand why and just felt ugly. \nSoft yta because I know you were trying to help your daughter, but I think you should have her meet with someone more knowledgeable about health and weight issues to figure out what\u2019s going on.", "YTA- addressing her weight at that moment makes you an AH. You should have been there for her, addressed the behavior of the kids at school- not confirm the very reason these bullies picked on her is her problem and needs to change. Is her weight a problem? Sure. People picking on her weight a problem? Absolutely. Suggesting weight loss when she just got traumatized *because of her weight* is not OK. You should have left her weight out of it and comforted your suffering child. To her you just sealed the deal that it was ok for them to bully her because she *is* fat, that\u2019s exactly how she will see it, because you at length talked about how to fix *her weight* when in this *specific situation* it\u2019s the behavior of the bullies that was wrong, and you should have focused on that. \n\nI\u2019m not saying never address her weight, but that one specific time was absolutely not the right time.", "I'm going to say YTA here even though your intentions were good.\n\nWhen I was in college, I had a roommate whose parents took a similar approach to her weight.   She consoled herself with food.  Her senior year of high school, they sent her to a weight loss camp.   She buried herself even more in food.\n\nBy the time she reached freshman year of college, she was 5'2'', 260 pounds, and would blow up at her parents the moment anything that could even be remotely construed as related to weight was said.\n\nOne of my sister's friends, under pressure from parents and peers, went in the opposite direction.  She almost died, ended up in the hospital for months after basically starving herself and doing massive damage to her body losing the weight.  She just went on one massive crash diet and lost 100 pounds in an insanely short time.\n\nThe best thing you can do for her (assuming you have truly ruled out medical causes for the weight)  is find a therapist who can help her to work through whatever issues she is dealing with (not limited to her weight.)    If she tells you that she wants to start losing it, you can offer whatever resources are possible--getting her to a support group, a program, a trainer, nutritionist, whatever will work.   But otherwise, focus on giving her the mental health support she needs and you are far more likely to really help her.", "YTA\n\nSorry mate. I\u2019m sure you were coming from a good place but such awful timing. Console and support your daughter.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t buying a bunch of garbage then how is she 230lbs? Clearly she either has a job that supports her snacks or you aren\u2019t as healthy as you say you are", "YTA\n\n>I was trying to make her feel better, and I suggested maybe we should work on some weight loss\n\nYeah, because the solution to your daughter being bullied is to insinuate that it's her fault and that if she wants it to stop, she should lose weight.  /s", "YTA The problem here is that she was bullied by assholes, and you suggested she should lose weight to appease the assholes.\n\nLet's pretend this is a different scenario entirely. Bullies can bully people about anything. What if it wasn't her weight? What if they bullied her for wearing glasses? Would you tell her to stop wearing glasses and just deal with not seeing well to make the bullies happy? What if they teased her about her nose, would you suggest she get plastic surgery?  What if a boy asked her out and she said no and they bullied her about that, would you tell her to just go on a date with a dude she's not into? \n\nDo you get it now? You just taught your daughter that she should change herself to make mean people happy.", "YTA for the timing. Like that was the absolute worst timing to have brought it up.  I do think the desire to work with her is right because she is a minor who is risking or already at the point of health issues with her weight being what it is. But JC why would you bring it up right after she\u2019d been humiliated by the boy she was into?", "A very gentle YTA... maybe you should have broached the subject with your wife first and then both of you should have called your daughters doctor for advice on how to broach the subject with the least amount of emotional trauma. And you shouldn't have chosen THAT particular time to bring it up either... you should have waited a couple of days so the sting of the school incident could have had to lessen with comforting words from her daddy & mom. \n So I suggest you & your wife call the doctor and ask them how to best proceed and also find your daughter some counseling for the emotional trauma from classmates and an appointment with a nutritionist(get a referral from the pediatrician)so she can learn how to take control of her diet on her own and wait for HER to ask you to help her at the gym.", "YTA.\n\nNya was complaining about being bullied for her weight, and instead of comforting her...you suggested that her weight was the problem. Like, you basically agreed with the bullies that her weight made her less worth of respect. I mean... she got bullied for being overweight, and instead of condemning the bullies you victim blamed and  confirmed that her being overweight was a reasonable reason for her to be bullied.\n\nWhether Nya should lose weight for health issues is something to discuss with her doctor. And any discussions of weight should be based on reinforcing her doctor's suggestions and completely separated from being bullied. If Nya expressed a desire to reduce her weight or exercise more, then it would be appropriate to suggest how you could help. \n\nNya deserves to be respected as a person and loved, period. She does not deserve to be bullied.  Her weight and body does not factor her right to exist in the world.", "YTA\n\nThe lesson you're teaching her is that she should change herself to suit other people. Is that really what you want her to do?", "YTA but only because you should\u2019ve waited to broach the subject when she wasn\u2019t balling her eyes out. Your intentions were good and your heart was in the right place but you should\u2019ve been helping her build self esteem in that moment then approach the subject of weight loss", "YTA. \nMaybe she should lose weight for medical reasons, but a doctor should say that.\nMaybe she wants to lose weight to look better or feel more secure about herself, but it wasn't the time to even mention the W in weight. \nI get where you're coming from, but that was an insensitive way of approaching the topic.\n\nMaybe talk to her about what she wants, and offer to help in whatever she needs, but don't straight up suggest that there's something wrong with her.", "Shame on you for letting it get that bad she's only 16 what the hell", "YTA but softly. In the car was absolutely not the time to bring up her weight. What you should\u2019ve done was comforted her and helped her build her self confidence up. I absolutely understand your concern for her weight, as childhood obesity is something that I struggled with and, had I had the help of a parent earlier in my teen years, I probably wouldn\u2019t have the problems that I do now. Again, offering to create a safe space where you and your child can work out together in is awesome, but this was awful timing, OP.", "NTA but maybe it wasn\u2019t the right time. I think a counselor or therapist suggestion would\u2019ve been a better choice, but you weren\u2019t calling her fat. Those of us living in larger bodies know we\u2019re bigger, so it\u2019s not like you were saying anything shameful or discriminating.", "YTA.\n\nNot the time man. Just Not the Time.\n\nYour Daughter was extremely, and justifiably, upset, and regardless of whether or not you meant well, you piled on instead of being empathetic. You don't sound like you even realize that's what you did, but it is.\n\n>I feel horrible and really think maybe I shouldn\u2019t of suggested it or worded things differently\n\nThat's about the gist of it, yeah. There was absolutely no way to bring this up, at this time, that was going to do *anything* other than make her more upset. Under other circumstances, you might have been perfectly fine, but this time, given that this is the entire reason she was being bullied, you just made it worse.\n\nDo your best to apologize, but do know that she might not forgive you for a while. From her perspective, you basically just sided with her bullies, regardless of your intentions. Good intentions don't always make you not an asshole.", "NTA. - So as a parent, I don\u2019t know if I could not say anything. It is such a sensitive topic and your daughter was highly attuned to the shame she feels. I think maybe you could have found a better time to bring it up, and maybe included your wife in the conversation\u2026 but your a concerned father, it is your place to say something, I don\u2019t see how your the asshole as long as what you said was carefully worded\u2026 go comfort her btw, I think she needs to hear you out and get comfortable with you again. Good luck OP!", "OP, don\u2019t take advice from Reddit on being fat. \n\nThere is SO MUCH that has been discovered about weight in just the last 6 weeks that has turned everything we know about it on its head. Your advice was harmful. \n\nFirst of all, listen to the Maintenance Phase podcast for starters. It\u2019s info, research, and statistics delivered with snark and humor. You need data. \n\nSecondly, she needs evaluated for an eating disorder/disordered eating. She has an eating disorder, btw. Skinny ppl aren\u2019t the only ones with eating disorders. \n\nThirdly, your entire family is killing your daughter. You\u2019re putting too much pressure on her about food and her weight. You let your other kids bully her. You let the school do it. You let her peers do it. How dare you, actually? \n\nYou don\u2019t think your daughter is beautiful, your whole family thinks she\u2019s fat and none of you are capable of seeing fat women as beautiful. You don\u2019t think that\u2019s true but it is. \n\nEducate yourself before you go any further with this. You\u2019re doing more harm than anything at EVERY. SINGLE. TURN. with this child and you\u2019ve already damaged her for life. \n\nYTA- bc it\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve never even done a google search about this.", "NTA\n\nBut your timing is fucking terrible.\n\nIgnore all the people talking about fat shaming, the truth is, her life will be harder if she is fat.  That might be hard to hear, but truth aint always easy.\n\nPerhaps therapy of some sort might help her.", "> I even thought about what to say before saying it\n\nthen you must not be very bright cuz its so obvious that it was the worst you could say at that moment and imply that she's at fault or something YTA", "YTA because you haven't actually done shit to help her. You can't even get the other two kids under control. This isn't about her health anymore, you're letting bullying happen in your house and when she literally had her privacy violated at school, yall just fucking put her in another gym class and made her still go to that school? Disgusting parenting.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter has been being bullied for her body, right after being publicly humiliated is not the time to bring up weight loss. \n\n\nTo say this directly after this bullying incident is just sending a really bad message to your child that if people are bullying her about something she should change that something to be accepted.Instead of teaching her about the benefits of being at a healthy weight. It seems like you care about what other people think of her rather than her health.\n\n\nYou should\u2019ve waited for this incident to blow over to bring up her health, and ideally you should\u2019ve already had this conversation by now, i\u2019m assuming she didn\u2019t become obese overnight.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing your best as a parent. You see how hurtful everyone is to her because of her size and you\u2019re concerned about her health. You didn\u2019t call her fat, you suggested working out TOGETHER   That\u2019s beautiful imo. You sound like a good dad. \n\nShe might need therapy. It would probably help her. It\u2019s got to be hard being bullied on a daily basis and it must be miserable for her. She might benefit from talking to a therapist about how she\u2019s been feeling. That might eventually help her to want to change and lead a healthier lifestyle as well.", "NTA-teenagers have it rough nowadays, especially girls. Maybe instead of talking to her about her weight, change some things around. lighter meals, family bike rides\u2026maybe she won\u2019t notice (she probably will but you are doing it as a family so maybe it won\u2019t be so upsetting).", "NTA - this is a serious health issue which will shorten her life if not gotten under control.   It's important to do what you can to help her.   \n\nSwitching gym classes or adding activities won't do much.   Those things help losing the last stubborn 10lb, not the first 50 when you're likely double your healthy weight.  The primary cause of obesity is simply consuming too many calories.   \n\nThe first thing I would do is remove every snack, ice cream, sugary breakfast cereal, etc, from the house.   Swich family dinners to more healthy versions and shrink portions (for example, if you make steak and vegetables, just buy a smaller steak and add some extra vegetables).  \n\nIf she's formed a habit of snacking all day, she's going to freak out because she's an addict going cold turkey without her favorite drug.  Good luck", "Jesus Christ the people in this thread are delusional. She will have a happier, healthier life if she loses weight. Someone needs to tell her the truth now, and you did it in a compassionate way. Nta", "NTA, you didn\u2019t say she was fat or say hurtful words to her, you tried to be an amazing, supportive dad and look out for your daughter. I think your suggestion was a great one! I really don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong here", "NTA", "NTA - OPs daughter is going to die from a heart attack in her 30\u2019s. She is 5 ft and 220 lbs. This isn\u2019t a little overweight, at this point she needs an intervention cause this girl is unfortunately addicted to food.\n\nLike honestly what was OP supposed to say? Lie and say she isn\u2019t fat? He presented a valid plan of action to his daughter to help her out. See how she instantly runs to her mommy to validate her hurt feelings and that dad is a big meanie? She is doing what most addicts do and avoiding the root of the problem. Her own actions. The daughter refuses to eat proper portion sizes, eats junk food regularly and refuses to do some form of exercise. She is deflecting and wallowing in her misery instead of taking concrete actions.", "I want to say NTA but something is missing.\n\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re wife and you\u2019re daughter accusing you for fat shaming to go to the gym.  Are they agents it?  Also, was she medicated or seen a doctor with her weight problem?  It does not matter if you eat healthy but something is causing it.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in a similar situation. Take your daughter to a doctor, preferably an endocrinologist, because she may have a medical condition.", "YTA! Excuse me? Body shaming your daughter?

You don't mention that she has a problem with overeating, you don't mention she has a problem with movement, and you and your wife follow a healthy lifestyle. You're the parent, how did she get this way? And if eating in a calorie deficit isn't enough for her to lose weight, you need to talk to a doctor", "YTA. She needed a shoulder not a lecture. I could have been your daughter (except I'm older than you are.) Hug your daughter and apologize. Tell her that she is beautiful. She won't believe you but she will appreciate the sentiment. \n\nIt's not about the food. I ate for plenty of reasons which I won't be going into. I suggest you set up therapy sessions for your daughter and take her in to the doctor to make sure nothing is physically wrong. Provide healthy meals and snacks. \n\nTalk to the school about the bullies. That behavior could escalate and end in tragedy. Also you need to do a better job of getting her siblings to stop making fun of her. Home should be her safe place.", "This comment is from the perspective of someone who was in your daughters position: \nYTA. The timing is TERRIBLE to say the least. Your job in the aftermath of that incident was simply to comfort your daughter, to listen to her vent and hold her why she cried. I find it hard to believe that you didn\u2019t realise how awful your timing was. I also find it hard to believe that you\u2019ve done enough to stop your other children bullying your daughter. Do better \nI also think you\u2019re going about it the wrong way. You said in one of your comments that you only ever have very healthy snacks in the house. I think it would be a good idea to start getting a few unhealthier treats for the house but to tell Nya that she can\u2019t buy her own food anymore. My mum did the same to me, and it worked wonders. Then she can still have her favourite foods, but in monitored, reasonable quantities. Maybe encourage her to save her money towards something she wants that isn\u2019t food related so it\u2019s not just burning a hole in her pocket. \nDon\u2019t make weight loss the stated goal here either, because that piles on the pressure. Express to her that you\u2019re concerned for her health, and say that preventing further weight gain is the goal. If you stop her from buying her own food, she\u2019ll probably start losing weight \nFinally, I would recommend reading up about binge eating disorder.", "Okay slight YTA. Your heart was in the right place but your timing was not so great. I get it, all good parents want their kids to be happy and healthy.\n\n1. Give her a shoulder to cry on. Let her vent and cry, and do all the things necessary to get it out. \n\n2. Then you contact the school and tell them that you'll now be contacting the proper authorities to file harassment charges and also that you'll be contacting a lawyer about taking action against *them* for their inaction in stopping and preventing further bullying of your child. \n\n3. If you haven't yet, get her into therapy.  They'll be able to help her develop the tools to better process and deal with this. And it's okay if the first few therapists don't work out, a lot of the times you go through a few to find the right person. She needs to find good outlets and healthy coping mechanisms to help get her thru this. My favorites are knitting and crochet! Even exercising is a good coping mechanism!\n\n4. Again if you haven't already, get her to a doctor. Have her tested for anything and everything! There could very well be a medical problem you didn't know was there that is causing this. \n\n5. Once she is in a healthy headspace and you know whether or not there is an underlying condition you can bring up losing weight. Try to ease her into the idea if you can. Just start off with something like \"hey, maybe if we go for a walk it'll help you clear your mind a little.\" Try introducing yummy but healthier snacks, \"hey fam, let's try these 'insert healthy yummy snacks here' together!\" The key is you have to be patient with her.\n\nRegardless though right now what she needs is a good hug and a shoulder to cry on. You made a mistake but it isn't the end. Once she's willing to talk it out apologize and let her know that first and foremost you love her and will always have her back no matter what. You know her better than I do so say whatever comes from your heart!  \ud83d\ude0a Good luck to you both!", "YTA. All she\u2019ll take away from this is that you agree with her bullies.", "Yta.

This level of emotional ineptitude honestly makes me question how this man found anyone willing to reproduce with him.\n\nLike, how does one, man or woman, make it to adulthood and keep such a basically faulty, rudimentary emotional compass? It boggles the mind.", "Exactly this. Take her to a doctor.  There could be an underlying health problem. You should always talk to a doctor before trying to lose a significant amount of weight. Especially a child.", "To change herself to suit other people that don't respect her at all anyway - OP fucked up on this, his intentions were good but he pretty paved more hell on his daughter by saying that right after she was traumatized by a nasty prank. YTA and OP needs to stay apologizing to his daughter for basically victim-blaming while bodyshaming her.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "This!! Maintenance phase is an amazing resource!!", "We didn\u2019t put her in another gym class, we requested an alternative for gym, like band, or an extra core.", "The thing is we don\u2019t have those things in our house. My wife and I make healthy dinner plans. We do have snacks in the house like veggie chips or popcorn. We do not have snack cakes or any of the sorts. We might have a tub of vanilla ice cream once in awhile, but usually our options of snacks are healthy choices. I am a fitness instructor 4 days out of the week, so I am pretty serious about health. But Nya does have access to her own money and buys snacks for just herself.", "I don't get it either, this thread likes to pretend that a person that is fat will not have an objectively harder life than that same person being fit.\n\nIts so incredibly dishonest.", "As someone who has been both in a smaller body and a bigger body, I\u2019m happier in my bigger body. My smaller body was me with anorexia, bulimia, and exercise addiction with a lot of medical side effects. This larger body is still training for endurance events like half marathons and half Ironmans but with perfect bloodwork and lung function and heart tests. Weight does not equal health. They should work on incorporating healthy habits if they\u2019re not there already but that\u2019s done in concert with medical professionals, not by acting like there\u2019s something wrong with his daughter right after she\u2019s been bullied.", "Weight does not equal health, and fat shaming has the exact opposite effect of helping someone adopt healthier habits if they aren\u2019t there. You have no evidence she\u2019s going to die of a heart attack. Stop fear mongering.", "Thank you. This is a difficult situation to maneuver, for anyone. Kids come first. Thank you for the kind words and the award", "Sure. Not a problem", "Have her doctor do a full thyroid panel. You need to use the word \"full\" if you're in the US. Sounds like a thyroid issue if she's eating the food you do.", "Best wishes for you and your daughter.", "You mentioned going to the gym with your daughter, but if she continues to eat this way, it will likely not impact her weight that much. You absolutely cannot outrun a bad diet. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried. \n\nOther people have mentioned therapy and having a meeting with her GP to test thyroid, etc. Figuring out what\u2019s fueling the bad diet is going to be a lot more impactful than a few days a week at the gym.", "I believe there is new research about obesity in the last month. We clearly don\u2019t understand it yet but since she is your daughter, maybe you need to brush up on the causes, issues, and psychological impact of it before just looking for a solution.", "Well\u2026. My mom sure didn\u2019t and made tons of comments to me about my weight (I wasn\u2019t even overweight) in high school\ud83e\udd73. I remember every single one. A lot of moms do this (dads too), so I\u2019m going to blame society.", "That's not really the point, she's still gonna see those people and be harassed by them", "Has she seen a doctor and had blood work done? That\u2019s  always a big worry for me when kids are overweight. Underlying thyroid conditions, PCOS, and some other things can lead to being overweight and there\u2019s medical help for this. Has she seen a therapist to discuss her relationship with food? Overall, I get that you\u2019re a concerned parent. You just might not have approached this the right way", "And imagining the whole world should change and ignore what they think is attractive. \n\nLike imagine if it was his son, and he was exhibiting neckbeard tendencies. Would people in this thread start saying women should stop bullying him and go on a date with him, or would people say he should change his behavior to be more attractive?", "She weighs 220 lbs at 5ft. Just did a google search for morbidly obese and the daughter qualifies. So yes she has a ton of potential health issues. This is her father not some rando off the street. OP is definitely the person who should be having a conversation with her about developing healthier habits.", "She has been to the doctor and there is no health issue causing the weight gain, but I am currently considering a therapist.", "I\u2019m in a larger body at 5\u20190\u201d but still do half marathons and half Ironmans. My bloodwork and heart and lung function tests are better than when I was in a smaller body because I got there through 3 eating disorders. Professionals should be working with his child on what is going on, not him. Your approach and way of thinking is what causes eating disorders in the first place. Just look at all of the people in the comments who have had them. Something tells me you\u2019re going to double down on the numbers though\u2026", "I wanted to suggest a therapist. Including her siblings and school mates and now you(that's how she sees it) everybody is basically bullying her which is affecting her mental health which can turn dangerous. Prioritize your daughter's mental health it can actually lead to an insight to her eating habits.", "Yes I am well aware of the Reddit hive mind regarding telling overweight people they are overweight. \n\nYou actually exercise regularly which is awesome and BMI can be completely wrong for certain body types. Some close family friends are Dutch farmer boys and they are big boned giants. BMI would have them as overweight but they are completely healthy with decent diet/exercise.\n\nThis girl shows all the signs of having an addiction to food. She needs help. If her own father gently encouraging her to come work out with him a few times a week causes her to go into a depression spiral then she does need professional help. Those professionals will also recommended exercise several times a week.", "But they may not recommend exercise. There is a hell of a lot that goes into eating disorder recovery. The first part is a dietician and therapist who can determine what is going on and then they go from there. Exercise could be triggering to her or something else might be going on. The human body is very complex, and every single one is different. \n\nOut of curiosity, do you have this much concern for thin people who have heart disease, don\u2019t exercise, and/or don\u2019t eat nutrient dense food often?", "YTA. Nya is being bullied at home and at school about her weight. How can you be such ineffective parents that you are allowing her siblings to fat shame her? And then you fat shame her too? \n\nShe\u2019s trapped in a vicious cycle of feeling shame about her body and eating to feel better or maybe to punish her body. She\u2019s on her way to develop a full blown eating disorder if she hasn\u2019t already. Your main concern should be her mental health, not being a bit overweight. I\u2019d say her biggest risk right now is suicide rather than a heart attack when she\u2019s in her 60s. You need to be much more worried about the effects of bullying and not having a safe space. You all need to see a family therapist and she also needs her own therapist. You need to do much better.", "YTA you decided that while she just got harassed and publicly humiliated about her weight to then add fuel to the fire and suggest that it is a problem and that if she losses weight it wouldn\u2019t happen your job in the moment was to support her emotionally you projected onto her what you wanted her to do instead of talking to her about how it felt why it wasn\u2019t okay for them to do that ect", "NTA. You need to discuss this with a therapist of some sort. It's heartbreaking to think of her youth and how many years she'll live being tormented about her weight. It's odd that one of three children would be obese; she needs a total medical workup to help determine what might be going on", "My dude you need to get her some medical help for this pronto. She is five foot tall and 16 and is bigger than me at 6'3 I don't think this is an exercise issue. If she doesn't get professional help now she's on track for a life from hell", "Thank you. So glad that you're in recovery, keep it up!", "He doesn't let kids bully her - addressing this is really tough at schools when they aren't supportive. Plenty of parents have tried tirelessly and struggled to stop school bullying. But good on you for having all the answers.", "And have her tested for PCOS.", "THIS! Higher! I have steadily gained weight from graduating HS to now (almost 30) and have just recently been diagnosed with PCOS and can accurately and appropriately address getting healthier. This is after years and years of trying, failing, and hating myself. Weight, health (because the two aren\u2019t always synonymous) and PCOS is a whole different beast", "I would also recommend a dietician. She\u2019s still in puberty and may need different nutritional needs. A dietician, in tandem with a therapist, will be able to help. I would recommend a dietician who is focused on a non-diet approach would be best. They are going to help and not do more damage (i.e. a calorie-restricted plan or a strict meal plan will almost certainly do more harm than good). This is about her health, not the number on the scale, and a dietician, GP, and therapist will all be able to help her with healthy habits and with her emotional habits. The scale doesn\u2019t tell that story.", "Yes I have empathy, I know multiple girls with high metabolisms who were routinely mocked all through school as being anorexic despite eating regularly and appropriately. I myself have to consume mass gaining protein shakes everyday if I want to gain any weight when I go to the gym. \n\nI actually agreed with you that professionals need to be involved. But I don\u2019t think a parent asking their child to go workout with them a few times a week is an AH move. Obviously it\u2019s triggered the daughter badly enough to put her in a depression spiral. So the next move is for OP and his wife to look into getting the daughter professional help both for her weight and her mental issues. Cause she is obviously not healthy both physically and mentally.", "That isn\u2019t the question I asked. I asked about thin people who have heart disease and/or who don\u2019t \u201ceat well\u201d or exercise.", "Lol seriously how is this in any way related to OP\u2019s post??? I have basically agreed with all your points except that I don\u2019t think a father asking his daughter to work out with him makes OP an AH. \n\nThis is what I and others mean when mentioning the Reddit hive mind. I have to be an AH cause I don\u2019t have an issue with a close family member or friend confronting an overweight/ obese person about their weight.\n\nI get this can triggering to some people cause a lot of people are AH about it. Unfortunately life isn\u2019t very fair. And a 5 ft, 220 lb girl who doesn\u2019t exercise is basically eating herself into an early grave.", "That is exactly why it has to do with the OP. You see some numbers and automatically think you know about her health. That's the whole damn point. You could have a person who is 5'0\" and 220 pounds and a person with is 5'0\" and 140 pounds and the person who is 220 pounds could be the healthier one. You're making assumptions based on her weight; it isn't about being triggered.", "NTA. You were trying to help the situation. It\u2019s just a shame that she took it negatively. She is pretty overweight and bullying aside, she should do something about it considering the health risks that come with being obese", "You were judged enough, so I am just telling you my experience as a fat teen, before you make those mistakes.\n\nI got really fat at age 17-18. I was old enough to know what to do. My mum kept judging me for everything I ate. Everything. When I had my breakfast at 9am she asked me if I really want to start eating now. I felt horrible the whole time and ate even more to comfort myself.\n\n\nComfort her. I think she will come through at some point and decide that she wants to lose weight on her own. You can ruin a lot without even wanting to. Be careful with what you say. Good luck dude! I think you got this.", "Should have thought a bit longer and harder about if right after being completely humiliated about her weight was the right time to say yeah! Lose some weight! I'll help!", "YTA she needed support and self love and you basically said there was a problem with her", "She is 16. What is he supposed to do? You can handle that up till maybe 12. After that it just gets ridiculous. She has access to her own money. It is not his fault.", "I find your comment very gross.\n\nI hate that you use such harsh language for someone who tried to help his daughter and was right but whose timing was not impeccable. The fact that you'd even say you're surprised someone would \"reproduce with him\" is what's mind-boggling to me, it's virulent and cruel.", "Absolutely. I had weight issues starting with puberty and would lose and gain without changing my exercise or food intake Each gain was more weight. I tried everything. When I was in my 30s, I went through fertility testing and my specialist ordered a full thyroid panel. It was discovered I had  Hashimotos, which is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the thyroid. My thyroid literally has holes in it. The weight cycling was a classic symptom. My family physician apologized. My mother never did. She thought until the day she died it was because I ate too much and didn\u2019t work out \u201cenough\u201d."]}
