You guys are way too enmeshed and as the mother she should have put you first and undid the enmeshment. She projected all this on you for years until it became normal, and never pushed either of you to get better so she could help you grow up and live your life.\n\nWhatever her motivations, you are an adult now and can make your own choices. I really recommend making ones that help you sort through this and distancing yourself from her physically to start.\n\nEdit: I will also say, I don't think co-sleeping as a kid is very weird though some might disagree. IMO it depends on context and can be fine.

But it is likely that your mother is mentally ill and/or has a personality disorder, and she is either unable or unwilling to acknowledge appropriate adult/child boundaries, and that makes her unsafe as a caretaker for young children.", "There are actually quite a few benefits from independent sleeping, and it\u2019s considered an emotional developmental milestone. \n\nIf he spent years sleeping independently, then I wouldn\u2019t be concerned about stunted growth, but if he\u2019s always shared a bed I would be worried", "You already should know why they're saying that. Are you even reading all the comments here? Are you really taking in every word? Because it seems like you aren't taking this seriously. If you truly have been listening to everyone here, you would understand why these words are being used to describe your situation. It's weird to see your mother in her underwear every morning. It's weird for her to see you in yours. Even if there is no sexual relationship going on, this is still a really bad situation. You don't need reddit, you need therapy. Now.", "Just. Read. The. Comments. \n\nStop trying to make out like this is normal. It's not. Get help... Peverted is putting it MILDLY. \n\nI won't reply to you further, you're seriously disturbed and I don't feel comfortable speaking with you.", "This isn\u2019t even normal for most roommates, much less a parent and child. It\u2019s not a sex thing, it\u2019s an intimacy thing, and it shows just how much she\u2019s raised you enmeshed with herself and for her own needs rather than yours.\n\nHow does she handle your dating? Is this the first girlfriend you\u2019ve had \u2014 at age 27 \u2014 for this never to have come up before? Is your mom jealous?\n\nIt may not even be obvious to you \u2014 my last ex\u2019s mom would say very nice things about every girl he\u2019d take an interest in, but within a few weeks would turn to subtle, then not so subtle, digs and insults to drive her off. He thought at first it was due to her looking out for him and trying to be sure he got the best partner, but after a few girlfriends he began to realize that she saw them as threats to her own status with him. \n\nNo date would *ever* be \u201cgood enough\u201d because then he would not be 100% devoted to Mom any more.\n\nSound familiar?", "That is still weird and wrong. I dont want to see my parents in their undergarments or have them see me. The fact is she is using you like an emotional support animal and you haven\u2019t grown independent as a result. You have grown to see this as normal and healthy; it is not. How different would things be if she hadn\u2019t encouraged this? I imagine you would be more confident and have more of a social life.", "Most people would be deeply uncomfortable seeing their parent in underwear. Or being an adult and being seen by a parent in underwear.", ">What sort of privacy?\n\nWell it's also where a lot of people masturbate.", "For instance, I've never met an adult man who sleeps with their mother.  That's way beyond the standard of normal behavior.  So we have no idea what you might consider acceptable.", "So where does sexytime happen?  Is your mother going to be home when it happens? Oh boy.", "Dude the whole issue here is that you\u2019re even thinking you have to ASK PERMISSION. You are 27 years old. You are completely emotionally bound up with your mother. This is not normal and women (and men dependant on your sexuality) will find this an absolute turn off. No one wants to date a man this close to his mother. You need to detach yourself physically and mentally from this situation as soon as possible. You will have to learn to live life without thinking about her every second of the day. That\u2019s going to be really difficult to start with but it\u2019ll get better with time. You\u2019ll need a fair bit of help with this, hence the many recommendations to use a therapist to help navigate this problem set.", "It has already interfered with your romantic relationship. Just say that and mention what she told you cause she was right", "TBH to this date, I struggle with hiding morning woods when I wake up.", "But my mom never tried to date again or see other men, Not as per my knowledge.", "The only way this could get weirder is if the genders were reversed.", "Yes, Holy F. My mom always complains about the female friends that I have, Saying they are not \u2018Decent\u2019 girls and something like that.", "Now, That I know all this, Now this is creeping me out.\n\nAll these years She was seeing me in my undies and she used to get dressed up in room while I am still there(Not naked, In Bra/Panties) But still, I never thought this was wrong and Knowing that my mom did it intentionally is most disturbing thing for me.", "I completely agree that this whole situation with OP is weird but to your comment - some people grow up in a chill household and not everyone has an issue with seeing their parents or vice versa like this. For some it's not something sexual.", "And pull the 'Don't you want grandkids?' card even if you don't want children.  Who knows what you want as an adult because you've been denied the chance to be an adult.", "You understand that means you are staying with her instead of a husband/partner then?", "I'm so sorry. But that's your hint . . . she was using you as a replacement husband. Not sexually (thank goodness), but for companionship and comfort. And that was never your job, and it wasn't healthy, and it wasn't fair to you.", "Nobody is that naive sorry", "dude, your mom fucking groomed you. You need to stop living with her and you need a therapist. Don't bother trying to date until you go to therapy for this.", "Have you dated before? What were you planning on doing if you wanted to have a sexual relationship with a woman? Also...why get an apartment with several other rooms if you aren't going to use them?", "Here is a suggestion: \"Mom, I want us to have seperate rooms. I feel that it is bad for us to continue to share the same bed.\"\n\nThere is a chance that your Mother does not realize that what she is doing is wrong. How is she with your Father? Was the divorce a mutual choice, or did he leave? Has she dated since?\n\nAlso, if she won't listen there is one question you can ask: \"What would it look like if someone found out that a single dad was sharing a bed with his teenage daughter?\"", "1) ensure you have control of all your financial accounts and that they are private. if bank accounts are only in her name, ask /r/personalfinance  for help\n\n2) buy an electronic copy of this book, assuming that she doesn't have visibility into your online accounts\nhttps://melodybeattie.com/books/codependent-no-stop-controlling-others-start-caring/\n\n3) get online therapy at an online service like betterhelp.com (again, keep it private) and use your health insurance (assuming you are in USA) and then start looking for mental health in your area covered by insurance. pls spend the money on therapy asap if you're financially able to\n\n4) does anything about children of dysfunctional families make sense to you? https://adultchildren.org/literature/laundry-list/\n\n5)  please look at the description of this book. many times you have noted that there is no sexual activity or nudity between yourself and your family member and this writer specifically notes that this is an unhealthy situation in which you, the child, have been recruited to meet the emotional desires of the parent.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Silently-Seduced-Revised-Updated-Children/dp/0757315879/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1310406761&sr=1-2\n\n\"\n\u201cThere's nothing loving or caring about a close parent-child relationship when it services the needs and feelings of a parent rather than the child.\u201d \"\n\n\n\u201cThere are many situations that will require you to set boundaries so you can be clear on who you are and what you need and want, in relationship with others. This is the most important part of your healing process, allowing for the unfolding of your true, authentic self as opposed to playing the role that was defined for you by your parent. This new defined self will be the compass that directs you in moving forward in your life.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAn important difference between overt and covert incest is that, while the overt victim feels abused, the covert victim feels idealized and privileged. Yet underneath the thin mask of feeling special and privileged rests the same trauma of the overt victim: rage, anger, shame and guilt. The sense of exploitation resulting from being a parent's surrogate partner or spouse is buried behind a wall of illusion and denial. The adult covert incest victim remains stuck in a pattern of living aimed at keeping the special relationship going with the opposite-sex parent. It is a pattern of always trying to please Mommy and Daddy. In this way the adult continues to be idealized. A privileged and special position is maintained; the pain and suffering of a lost childhood denied. Separation never occurs and feelings of being trapped in the psychological marriage deepen. This interferes with the victim's capacity for healthy intimacy and sexuality.\u201d", "because she's using you to fill that void. that's the point. she doesn't date or have a social life because she gets to use you for all her emotional support and she doesn't care that she's hindering your life and development by doing it. She's USING you. YOU ARE BEING USED.", "With all kindness, you've said this a few times as though it negates your mother using you to fill the role of a partner/husband and it only proves that point further. She never dated because you have been filling that emotional need your whole life. I'm sorry that your mother emotionally stunted you, but as an adult you have to set up boundaries and figure out how to build a life for yourself. You should really consider therapy to work through this.", "She doesn\u2019t need to see other men, she\u2019s emotionally dating her son. This is some emotional incest. I think your mom knew the whole time too, at least at some level. If you made a move I don\u2019t think she\u2019d block you, let that sink in.", "But I have never ever seen her getting involved with other men or dating someone\u2026", "How about going all out and moving out?", "Because you\u2019re filling that role, emotionally at least.", "It's because she decided to make you fill that role for her. She devoted all of that into you and made you her sole focus, which might seem (and she probably even told herself) was benevolent. But it was not because you didn't get to have a normal life with room to grow up and feel things normally since you always had to be everything for her.", "Bc emotionally you are filling that role", "And.. you never even once fucking wondered? lol", "Also a good option, but it is a very drastic step. Depending on the level of codependancy it might not be the best first step for OP, but more of a goal in recovery."]}
