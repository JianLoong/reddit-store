She finds it disturbing that how is my mom OK with this? and Why is she sharing bed with me?\n\nShe literally blamed my mother for using me for her emotional comfort and said that I am being manipulated my my own mom here and I need to distance myself from her for my own good! I am shocked and confused here, IDK If I am doing something \u2019WRONG\u2019 or my mom is \u2018USING\u2019 me.\n\nAITA here?\n\nPS- To make things clear, There is no physical relationship going on b/w me an my mom, Its gross to even think of it.

She don't have any social circle as such. \n5 years ago she got Herpes on her mouth, which she said happened randomly and Knowing that it's an STD I believed her because she was not even dating, but still to this date It buggs me.\nYes, As I mentioned in comments, She had shamed me when she saw me touching myself when I was a teenager, She councled me that it's very bad and I should never do it again.", "created_utc": 1691935276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pzok6/aita_for_sharing_bed_with_my_mother/", "score": 511, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If we visit her and watch a movie in her room, we\u2019ll fall asleep and take a nap with her. But as far as on a regular basis, I do find it odd.

I can\u2019t imagine how difficult this situation was for you as a teen, when you didn\u2019t have your own space and privacy.

You guys are way too enmeshed and as the mother she should have put you first and undid the enmeshment. She projected all this on you for years until it became normal, and never pushed either of you to get better so she could help you grow up and live your life.\n\nWhatever her motivations, you are an adult now and can make your own choices. I really recommend making ones that help you sort through this and distancing yourself from her physically to start.\n\nEdit: I will also say, I don't think co-sleeping as a kid is very weird though some might disagree. IMO it depends on context and can be fine.

The sense of exploitation resulting from being a parent's surrogate partner or spouse is buried behind a wall of illusion and denial. The adult covert incest victim remains stuck in a pattern of living aimed at keeping the special relationship going with the opposite-sex parent. It is a pattern of always trying to please Mommy and Daddy. In this way the adult continues to be idealized. A privileged and special position is maintained; the pain and suffering of a lost childhood denied. Separation never occurs and feelings of being trapped in the psychological marriage deepen.

My daughters do it sometimes, too. And as they grow into adults and come home to visit, if I\u2019m still single and one of them falls asleep in my bed, awesome. They\u2019ll always be my babies. But it is certainly not our norm! They have their own beds. And I need my own space. And my own bed!

She was alone for a very long time, and from a very young age she had to assume a huge responsibility. She has seeked out comfort in the form of the only person around, and the only person who could never leave, and that was you.\n\nIn many cases like these, the parent sees the child as an extension of themselves, and sees the child's development and independence as a form of abandonment. If you become independent and have your own life, she will be alone again. It's like ripping off a limb, because she has difficulty viewing you as a person seperate from herself. She has tied the idea of motherhood as central to her identity, and any form of independence as an attack against her.\n\nBut she also longs for the comfort of someone to support her and her own emotional needs. Children and babies are very easy to mold into that role, because children will alter their behavior to seek parental approval, and it's possible that underlying mental illness or trauma has made her blind to it. She may have been that emotional support person in her own past, or severely neglected and doesn't understand what a normal sense of boundaries is.\n\nParents may often ask inappropriate or difficult questions for their development, treating the child as another adult and asking for advice or help with a concept too difficult for the child to grasp. She may see you as both her child and her husband, and use you as a person who can emotionally support both needs. Or use you as a therapist who can support her through a crisis, without respecting that you are not capable of providing her the support she needs.\n\nShe may make you feel responsible for her emotions or panic attacks, and in doing so making you responsible for her well being. It instills a guilt complex that you can't leave her alone, because she isn't capable of taking care of herself.\n\nMost often undiagnosed mental illness or unaddressed trauma is why parents engage in emotional incest, but they often won't undergo treatment or understand why what they're doing is wrong.
