Don\u2019t cook for those entitled brats even if they end up not inviting the extra guest.

That is so tempting", "NTA! It's high time someone else hosted and you got looked after.  Say that...

I\u2019m all about breaking toxic cycles and creating my own traditions, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you enjoy any aspect of being the sole person responsible for thanksgiving, so take my opinion as you wish:\n\nI don\u2019t like Thanksgiving personally. It seems forced and the labor is often unequal. My mother always did thanksgiving at her house I\u2019d watch her go crazy with the planning, shopping, prepping, cooking and it just seemed\u2014\u2014not worth it. I don\u2019t think she actually liked it but she\u2019s bought more into \u201cbe miserable for family bc that\u2019s what family does.\u201d Shes a bit upset with me bc I\u2019m not carrying on that same \u201ctradition\u201d.

And I\u2019m certainly not gonna pay these crazy prices to cater to whiners and beggars. \n\nI\u2019d like you to really take to heart \u201cyou do not have to be miserable for family\u201d. I know it\u2019s hard to break that cycle of expectation and performance but after that first time, it gets so much easier. \n\nPlease, do not put effort towards people that make no effort with you.

You\u2019ve done your time and now it\u2019s time for someone else to step up if they want a family dinner. This goes for Christmas dinner as well. Just make it clear you are finished making big dinners because it\u2019s simply too much at this point in your life. Stand firm. It\u2019s time for you to be a guest.

Honestly, at this stage I'd stop hosting altogether.\n\nTell your husband that you are happy for him to take over all of the prep and cooking if he still wants to host, otherwise you want to cut way back, maybe say you're happy for step-daughter to host at her home, and you'll bring a salad or dessert, or if they want to try to find somewhere that's not yet fully booked and eat out, otherwise you'd prefer to give it a miss as the whole thing is too exhausting .\n\nAnother option is too suggest a radical change - say you are happy to have a big meet up and spend time together, but the cooking, prep and clean up are too much given your health, so you're happy to host pizza night with everyone splitting the bill, paper plates all round so everything just goes in the bin at the end of the party, and no one has to cook.\n\nIt sounds as though everyone who comes is a relation of your husband's, not yours, but you are the one doing all the work and having people complain.", "You know what you need to make for Thanksgiving?  *Reservations*.\n\nAnd if that won\u2019t fly?

Your husband, the eager host can pay for everything, since putting on this dog and pony show is so important to him.\n\nI completely sympathize with not wanting to cater to opinionated, messy, critical, and unhelpful guests. \n\nNTA for not wanting to do it *again!*, especially since you are in constant pain. They should be feeding and catering to *you*.", "I say with love,\n\nYour problem isn't with him. Your problem is with everyone else. He hasn't done anything other than be a man. It sounds like you just don't want to host,  which is fine, but take it up with the actual problem.  Your ungrateful fil, bil, and step daughter. \n\nDo you have to feed this guy too? No. But the alternative is him staying at home alone while this household/ family nearby all goes to yours. \n\nDon't host if you don't want to host, but you clearly are projecting on him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your husband says it's no big deal, he can cook the entire dinner for himself.   \n\n\nI think the most important thing is that you take a stand and make it your hill to die on. If you want to celebrate it with family, make it clear NOW that you won't be hosting or cooking Thanksgiving dinner. If you are willing to make a dish, stick to a side dish. But again, it all depends on your shiny spine.\n\nIf they start complaining and keep doing so, save the money and go on a small holiday or out for dinner if that's possible.\n\nFamily means things go both ways. My ILs used to prepare Christmas dinner for a whopping 14 people. After COVID they felt too old for that. So now my husband and his sisters invite them. If we have a family Christmas, everyone chips in.  It saves money, time, energy and frustration.", "NTA\n\nDon't cook at the holidays for any of them.  Make reservations for yourself and your husband for Thanksgiving and go out.\n\nAt Christmas, get some good cold cuts for sandwiches or something.  (That's what I do.)\n\nTell everyone, \"With my health, I won't be hosting any meals this year.\"", "NTA. Your husband can make Thanksgiving for this wad of people while you spend a day or two at a hotel relaxing. Make sure he knows he can clean up after it's all said and done, as well, since \"it's just one more plate.\"\n\nDo not let them use you or walk all over you anymore. You are important for more than just serving them. Stand tall and stand up for yourself!!!", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like is time for serious change. You are being used, and I don't see how you can be thankful when you have this thankless group to deal with on thanksgiving. \n\nNow, as for the change, it sounds like something drastic is necessary because your husband doesn't seem to understand how big a deal catering for 8 (have I counted correctly?) is.  So, maybe it is time for him to learn. Now, I'm not suggesting something drastic like broken bones which make you unable to cook, but it would be such a shame if you came down with something which left you too ill to do the preparation and cooking. /s  \n\nBut it sounds more time for your stepdaughter to take her turn. After all, most the guests are residents in her home. \n\nIf you can afford it, and want to spend time with them on thanksgiving, consider buying in pre-made, or going out to a restaurant. If you are not so keen for their company, last minute trip for two could be nice. \n\nOh, and OP, I've just seen your explanation as to why you think you might be the AH. Has your husband seriously said you will cause them not to come around if you don't cook?  So, he's saying his own daughter and grandkids wouldn't visit on thanksgiving if you are not catering. Seeing you is not reward it itself?", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s a reason restaurants are open and supermarkets have prepared meals on Thanksgiving.", "NTA\u2026wife and I gave up the whole hoopla holiday dinners a long time ago.

I do t know why they brought him but he paced the floor waiting for me to get food on the table. Left his plate at the table. Left without even a thank you. Seems like he already expects it. But yes I\u2019m just done with waiting on people", "That\u2019s what I think. I didn\u2019t put it in the story but I have a son with a new wife. He\u2019s been around me enough to know he needs to help. He always cooks several dishes and he will help clean so I hate to not have them. They are not the problem. I was so sick by the time we were done last year my son and his wife did all the dishes and put away the food but it\u2019s not fair for him to have to do it all either. So I think we will be making reservation for a change", "The good writer Elizabeth David once recommended omelette and champagne for Christmas lunch because of the stress that some people have with these big family holidays. If you're getting stressed like this, stop. Do something different. If your family members think it's no big deal, they can cook. Even better, they can host. Or the menu can be completely different. Either way, OP should hang up the apron this year and let someone else sort it. Noones going to go hungry, and they might just remember to say thank you.\nNTA.", "Great,, if it's no big deal, your husband will have no issue with taking it on. \n\n(in my family, these things (not thanksgiving since we are not in the US, but other big family events) work with everyone pitching in. Once people arrive, they help out with last minute prep, normally those coming will bring desserts or sides, travel permitting, and then of course the main cook will not do any of the clearing or washing up because they have worked so hard on the prep work. (And of course, if you are hosting, you decide what you are making and no one would dream of complaining or criticizing - if there is something that you want because you feel that Christmas / thanksgiving / whatever isn't complete without it, you offer to bring and you do any prep needed (including planning and checking ahead so it doesn't disrupt the hosts plans - e.g. you can't take up half the kitchen and 3 burners on the hob just bas the host needs them to finalize the main meal)", "It\u2019s always no big deal for people that don\u2019t need to do it. My mother was the same on new year\u2019s eve dinners (east asian) when I was little and she used to have to cook for my whole extended family on my father\u2019s side, so 3 families and a couple, during which time none of my aunts would help (uncles are useless in the kitchen anyway). She finally put her foot down and we have been eating out for new year\u2019s eve dinner since. Best decision on my dad and uncles\u2019 part honestly.", "In my family all the women set the table, lay out the food, cut the pies and cakes and get everything together. No one sits except the men. And then when everyone is done ALL the women get up and start washing dishes and condensing the food down where everything can be washed and putting away food. Wiping down tables and sweeping the floor. It\u2019s quick because everyone helps. I told my husband I was going to celebrate with my family this year (it\u2019s been 10 yrs since I\u2019ve been with my family)", "We actually flew to St. Croix one year over Thanksgiving, laid on the beach, and had the turkey dinner at a hotel there. With only 3 people in the family and now 2 since retired..I haven\u2019t cooked a whole turkey in probably 40 years\u2026and could probably count the total number of them ever on one hand with fingers left over. Turkey breast\u2026a few more but usually a whole roasted chicken or a game hen or duck breast instead.", "Why do the men get a free pass?  This seems very odd to me."]}
