It would take an openminded crowd, though, to accept it. But these holidays really should be about being together, not about what you happen to put in your face. Once you've eaten, your stomach doesn't care what you had, unless it was poisonous or very unhealthy.", "Her house is really small. However I agree if she wants her husbands family and her dads family together she needs to host. She won\u2019t cook cause she never does. She gets her hubby to do it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a stress free time for her cause she just hangs out and drinks", "Yes I told my husband I would go spend the holidays with my family this year since it\u2019s been so long. He says I\u2019m being rude. Said you haven\u2019t seen them for the holidays in years. I told him maybe it\u2019s time for me to start again. So now he\u2019s frosty", "Yeah they all get to catch up. Just not me. I\u2019m too busy getting things ready. Then they bolt like lightening after they get their leftovers, leaving the dirty dishes", "Yeah, you do that. Use that money to get a vacation just for yourself, inform your husband that HE will be responsible for fixing any mess made in the house or kitchen, and remember to give thanks that you are not having to deal with those assholes this year.", "Take that attitude. Hey honey, it's no big deal, you just need to go shopping for everything.\n\nYou're cooking, right? You said it was no big deal.. you know IM not cooking, I told you that weeks ago.\n\nAnyway, no big deal, I'm sure YOU will figure something out.\n\nThen have a headache the morning of thanksgiving, and do whatever you want, far from the men or the kitchen.", "No big deal for *them*, clearly.\n\n(All they do is show up, and eat!)", "Great. If it is no beg deal, they won't miss it. They apparently MUST have the labor they all tell you doesn't matter and deserves no recognition. If they won't come over unless you spend hundreds of dollars and days of time cooking in constant pain, so they can make a mess, take all the leftovers and never thank you, THEY DON'T NEED TO COME AROUND!", "Even if you don't make the turkey and ham, you are on your feet for HOURS cooking a Thanksgiving meal. Even if someone helped with the prepping, it would be great. If no one can even contribute, then no meal for them", "\u201cThis year, I\u2019ll be making one side and husband will make the turkey.  We will be using paper plates for easy cleanup and everyone is expected to clean their place at the table. All other dishes including dessert will be potluck. You can text me what you are bringing. If no one brings anything I will not be blamed for providing only what I said I would. I am no longer willing to be used as labor without gratitude. It is, after all, Thanksgiving. Let\u2019s all be grateful for each other. If you are attending, you are pitching in.\u201d\n\nOP, you set the table before they come. You preheat your oven to keep things warm. You then pour yourself a drink and direct others to where the glasses and drinks are, you tell them where to put their dishes and when to put them on the table. You don\u2019t do anything else.", "NTA. Just don't cook. Period. They'll throw *such* a fit, but just like with young children, sometimes you have to ignore the temper tantrum. (I suggest you get yourself wine & a few brownies, & a comfy chair.)\n\nThey're grown ups. They can fend for themselves or step up & contribute for a change.", "Perfect!  Maybe you can go visit the son at his house!", "How about you visit with your son at Thanksgiving at his home and allow your husband to host his family for a few holidays. They may get the point then. (And don't allow your son to be bullied into inviting these people either).", "I\u2019d tell him that you are not his servant. be direct with him.  He can\u2019t even say thank you means he is not welcome.", "And you need to address this with your stepdaughter and her husband. \n\n'Don't bring your father/FIL to my home expecting him to eat. He lives with you and you're responsible for him. The man can't even mutter a thanks or bus his own plate.'  I'm guessing neither of them did either? Then none of them needs to come to your home expecting to be fed anymore.\n\nAs a matter of fact, OP. You know what my mom has started doing when her ungrateful stepchildren stop into town expecting her to cook? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. She stopped doing it. \n\nYour household apparently consists of you and your husband. You are not required to feed and clean up after all these people. Your husband should also be helping you around the home and helping to prepare meals.\n\nI know it's not the 'traditional' way of things but some traditional value systems need to die. If there's one thing I've been learning as I round the corner to 50, is that love is action and it must always be reciprocal. The reason why you're so tired and disgusted beyond your physical ailments? The lack of reciprocal love and appreciation from all these people in your life that continue to take from you without realizing that they too must give to you.", ">Left his plate at the table. Left without even a thank you. Seems like he already expects it. But yes I\u2019m just done with waiting on people\n\n*facepalm*\n\nI am so sorry you are treated this way.", "It's super fair to be done. If i were you I just wouldn't host anymore.", "Damn that sounds awesome. Add a quick green salad and some over/air-fry-erd chips, and you got a hell of a meal", "My family always does a breakfast casserole for Christmas brunch. You can make it ahead of time and stick it in the fridge, then just pop it in the oven on Christmas morning.", "My family does vegetable soup and hot dogs for Christmas Eve. Because my grandfather worked at a dairy (no changing that schedule even for Christmas) and she basically said there was no way she was getting four young children ready for Christmas Eve service and the pageant alone AND making a big dinner, so soup and hot dogs it was. Now the entire extended family 65+ years later does that. A few things have been added like vegetable pizza and pudding and of course cookies, but the main meal is the same. And it\u2019s the best Christmas Eve meal ever, to me.", "And complain... don't forget that!  Apparently they think it's all they need to contribute.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m over it. In a couple weeks FIL will put in a list for the pies he wants. It\u2019s not happening this year", "That was my plan but my son lives several hours away. Due to my health the drive is difficult for me. The town he\u2019s in is very small so he wants to come here for Black Friday. I told husband he can cook and clean for his family and I will take my family out for thanksgiving", "I parbake cinnamon rolls and freeze them and then make some hash browns and microwave bacon.", "I don\u2019t understand why the men don\u2019t help.  My son helps in the kitchen, son and husband help clean up.  Husband doesn\u2019t cook because he burns water, but he does dishes as we go.", "What's this - except the men? My brother and I cook and clean together and have for over 20 years. Other people help if they are around and can. Growing up Mom and I cooked, but the boys and men cleaned. Well, Dad polished the silver - it was his thing.", "Go somewhere quiet for Thanksgiving. Maybe get a hotel room and order room service and let your exceedingly ungrateful family realize the work that goes into a meal.\n\nNTA but you need to stand up for yourself. Men help in my family. Hell, my dad made most of the last Thanksgiving because Mom hurt her wrist. If they refuse to help then REFUSE to cook.", "Go be with you family!  It's time.  And time for everyone on your husband's side to figure out how to do Thanksgiving themselves.  Heck, I'd make it my annual tradition to \"go back home.\"  You have the power to stop this - please do it!  For yourself!", ">I told my husband I was going to celebrate with my family this year (it\u2019s been 10 yrs since I\u2019ve been with my family)\n\nYES!", "Ooh I like that idea, might have to add those to the meal as wel lol", "A lot of households are like that. In my family too, even though the women also work outside the home and all worked inside the home as well, the men sat, watched football, and yet were given the 'honor' of carving the turkey.\n\nThis was true in any household I visited for the holidays, although, the one I am thinking of, especially true. But she had a good son, and a good grandson.\n\nI will say a few men (two sons, and one grandson) helped a bit, but 95 percent or more, was the women's doing. The men watched football afterward as well, while the women cleaned up.  \n\n\n(And the kicker was, despite rising *before dawn* to begin cooking whatever had to be cooked that day, the women still had to go dress up, before guests arrived, as well.)", "tradition. Even my very feminist mother didn't mind on Thanksgiving that the women took over doing it all. One exception, every one helped clear the table.", ">I agree.  My dad can't cook at all, but when my mom hosted, he would peel potatoes, move furniture, set the table, etc. and anything else that needed to be done.", "Yeah that\u2019s my plan. May cause a divorce but I\u2019m okay with that too", "Yeah, there is really nothing like fresh-baked cinnamon buns on a holiday morning. And the way I make my hashbrowns, or they're more like home fries I guess, is by baking some potatoes while I'm making dinner the night before, and then chopping them up in the morning and roasting them with some olive oil and seasonings, so it's very quick since they're already cooked.\n\nI don't like eggs so we adapt what we do like to be easier.", "I grew up in an abusive home, and I loved Thanksgiving because nobody fought on that one day. My dad took over the kitchen and he'd call us in to help with things, one kid at a time.   \n\n\nHonestly, I think that him staying busy all day was why there was no fighting, but I'm not letting that take away from my happy memories.", "Okay, where do you live so we can come over for Thanksgiving? :)\n\nI will be trying this recipe out.", "Canada, so you'll have to wait til next year for Thanksgiving ;)\n\nIf you wanted to be fancy you could throw in a few chopped up bell peppers and onions, too."]}
