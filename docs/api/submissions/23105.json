There is one exception.\n\n  \nOn top of one of the malm dressers, the one that contains my clothing, there are probably six or seven shirts, hoodies, etc. that are just strewn about. And they've been there for awhile. At first, this pile began as a place where I just sat clothes that I was going to re-wear the next day - a hoodie, a light jacket, clean sweatpants that I had only wore for a few hours, etc. But over time it also became a dumping ground for shirts that need a button re-attached, etc. Some of these shirts have been there for months because neither of us know how to sew and neither of us are probably learning how to sew any time soon.\n\n  \nThis has always been a slight annoyance to my wife. This has become complicated, though, because one of our cats has really taken a shine to this pile of clothes. It's high up, it gets sunshine for the window, and it's dirty clothes. That's primo cat real estate. Little homie sits up there like six, seven, hours a day. The clothes are now covered in a fine layer of orange fur. It's very cute. He's clearly very happy. I have christened the dresser \"Dirty Clothes Tower.\"\n\n  \nMy wife is a gentrifier. She wants to evict my kitty from the tower. She wants it to be clean, sterile. Raise rents. Put in some horseshit gastropub called \"Hook and Arrow.\" An Orangetheory. Put a \"proper cat bed\" up there, some fucking gentrification box lookin' ass apartment building type shit. My kitty likes it how it is. He likes the mess. Kitties love dirty clothes. It's the only part of the house that is messy.\n\n  \nI continue to defend the existence of dirty clothes tower. Occasionally I add a new garment. This is the only thing that we argue about. She thinks I am being a child. I think it is harmless and the cat likes it so it's cute.

She has us well trained not to leave dirty clothes on any surface including the floor. (On another note, yes, she has been to the vet and had every test in the box to find out why she sometimes prefers a nice soft place to pee instead of her litter box. The tests all ended with a Prozac prescription.)", "Perfect answer, I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by all the YTAs", "I'm not saying the cat tower shouldn't be condemned by the city but I am saying that it is really unhealthy to view this kind of dispute as indicating an inanimate object is more important than your spouse and if you do feel that way and it does foment contempt to your partner, then your partner is the one who should have divorce in the back of their mind.  In this situation it's obvious OP is in the wrong, but try looking at it an ugly family heirloom lamp and it's obvious you have some unhealthy internalizations about relationship boundaries.", "X", "Oh, this is long past \"can't be bothered\".  This is intentionally leaving it there *because* he knows it annoys his wife.  He's being spiteful.", "Finally, somebody with a brain. It\u2019s like calling somebody with a healthy diet that eats one small dessert a day an unhealthy glutton. Just because OP has one tiny area I\u2019d dirtiness that honestly now serves another purpose doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a slob at all. You clearly have things about your wife you don\u2019t like, so she just needs to suck this one up for gods sake.", "I laughed at too hard at this.", "I am literally OP\u2019s wife and I agree with your wife which makes it extra funny you\u2019re being downvoted.", "What you do is line the cat bed with a dirty shirt.  The cat likes that spot, it'll use the bed.", "Then let him have a junk drawer or something that she doesn't have to *look at* every day of her life.  The cat would probably be over the moon to have a \"proper cat bed\" if OP lined it with a dirty shirt.\n\nYTA, OP.  What she wants is reasonable.  Stop being spiteful.", "Hey if that\u2019s what makes him happy \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "I\u2019m prettty sure a dog person wouldn\u2019t find something covered in dog hair cute, just as I\u2019m pretty sure 99% of cat people wouldn\u2019t find something covered in cat hair cute.", "Dude I\u2019m not gonna divorce my husband over kitty clothes tower.", "Exactly.  The clothes may have attracted the cat to that spot initially, but now the cat is attached to that spot.", "As OP\u2019s wife I find this characterization kind of hilarious and very inaccurate.\n\nMy husband is a very silly guy and he made his dumb post cute and silly. The clothes tower is really not that big of a deal. \n\nHis humor in this post is not some insidious thing used to undermine me, I promise."]}
