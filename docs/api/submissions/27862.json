Then it\u2019s a table argument while everyone claims they put the right amount in until someone gets annoyed and just makes up the difference.  A tip on a table of 12 should be a minimum of 20% in the US.

We'll pay for what we consumed\".  \nTheir bill was around $150.   \nOn the drive home my wife thanked me for speaking up.", "NTA, I think what you did was perfectly fine.

If they are going to split the bill, that needs to be announced at the beginning.  Then others can help pay for you to eat Lobster and have a $200 bottle of wine.

You hear a dozen people who have been drinking all day, and have a meal at a shared table.

Otherwise, if you go out every 5 years, it never gets even.

In my friend groups we always just paid for whatever we ordered. Unless it was a special occasion and we were specifically taking someone out, then that person didn't pay for shit and everyone else covered them. But, like you said, that was something we all planned and agreed to and would make sure we kept things within everyone's budget.

Many moons ago, I took my sibling out along with her roommates when they first started grad school in the city I was living in. A friend who worked nearby asked if she could come bc she liked the restaurant. She was also an alum and excited to meet the newbies. My friend ordered the most expensive truffle pasta dish (3x the cost of others) and two glasses of wine. My sibling and roommates ordered simple pasta dishes and had water. Guess who wanted to split? I told my friend straight out no and that her portion was significantly more than all of ours. I later gave my sibling and their roommate back all the money bc I didn\u2019t tell them (bc ppl over order when you do), that it was on me but didn\u2019t want to cover my friend\u2019s portion. Needless to say, that friend never really talked to me again and I was fine to have one less mooch in my life. Still shocks me to this day that she was making 6 figures trying to sponge off some new grad students.", "And drank. NTA", "I'd add a third of wanting the credit card points.

Snatching the check is only acceptable if you are paying the whole thing.

But yeah, it was to get the airline miles lol.", "Edited, I did a dumb", "I don't understand it either. Until recently I only saw it if you took friends out and you explicitly said it was on you or you were celebrating something. It was never common among coworkers or large groups. \n\nI know certain restaurants won't split larger bills but how that equated to everyone doing an even split is beyond me.", "That's the way! No one should ever have a problem with paying for what they indulge.", "I'm American and it's fairly new to me.\n\nI've only ever seen it among coworkers. In my situation it was because people felt pressured to go to go out with their coworkers because they thought if they didn't it would affect their job. Certain people can't afford it or live outside their means so someone who thinks they are being considerate says everyone will just split it. In reality, they are just making it awkward for the people who also can't afford it but don't talk about finances with coworkers. \n\nIt is also often a jerk who wants the lobster for the cost of a salad or to some how profit using bullshit math.", "It's not everywhere in the US, but there are a LOT of people who think if you go out for a group dinner you should expect to split it evenly. I personally hate it, but my group of friends generally does this.\n\nI now tell people in advance if I'm not in a position to split the check that night, and I will often just open my own tab at the bar to avoid having to split those bills.", "I\u2019m Canadian and used to have a friend who would pull this shit in a group.

Up to 5 pet person, I would say you would be a bit annoying, but this is s big difference.\n\nNTA", "I even got in the habit of telling coworkers I didn't have Venmo or Cash App. If I paid they'd \"just send it later\" and take their sweet time and if they paid they'd just say \"You can send me $50 for your portion\" when I knew I spent less. \n\nIt always caused tension because I'd call them out and obviously they aren't the type of people to have a mature reaction to having their bullshit exposed. It's amazing how people prioritize making an extra $20 over having a decent work environment.", "Unfortunately, it was for a smaller company where there was no official HR office. If there was an actual HR department there is no way that manager would have been there for various reasons. They were the main reason I left.", "Yeah, I don't think the point thing was really wrong it was just the way they went about it.

It's not always old money but being either frugal or leeching off.", "Yeah in my friend group we decide who puts stuff on their card partly based off of who will get the most points.
