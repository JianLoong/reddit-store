Trying to get the cash right for a bill for a large table always ends up shorting the total. People don\u2019t pay the right amount including taxes, fees and tip. Then it\u2019s a table argument while everyone claims they put the right amount in until someone gets annoyed and just makes up the difference.  A tip on a table of 12 should be a minimum of 20% in the US.
