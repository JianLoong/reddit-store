Her bday is tomorrow. And this is her 2nd of punishement. I cancelled her birthday as part of punishment and the other part is not allowing her to go out for 4 days. She still has electronis available.\n\n\nEarlier today, My ex contacted me and asked about the bday cancellation. I told him what happened and he said that he'll throw her the bday party since I cancelled. I said that he can't throw her the party when she's grounded and isn't allowed to leave the house for days. He called me ridoculous but I told him that he was encouraging bad behavior and acting like the cool parent instead of working with me on fixing these behavioral issues. He said that since he's also the parent then I cannot stop him from throwing her a party and he'll do it tomorrow. We got into a big argument and my husband agrees that my ex is being an enabler. But my daughter's grandparrnts got involved as well and told me I can't stop her dad from celebrating her bday and said that I needed to let it go and suggested I put off the rest of punishment til after the bday. But I refused. I feel like he's undermining my parenting and deliberately going against my input.", "created_utc": 1668537968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw5yvl/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_father_that_he_cant/", "score": 7173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus, their bad behavior may stop altogether. Maybe even go to therapy or learn how to meditate if you get angered easily.\n\n2) You don't get to make decisions for your children while they are with the co-parent. Either you a) discipline the child on your own time or b) speak with the co-parent and come to a consensus on how to handle the child.\n\n3) You sound like you want to have control over everyone in this situation.

However, my ex has also talked to me about these disciplinary actions before it was my turn to have our daughter.  Sometimes I agreed and other times I did not.  OP dealt out this punishment unilaterally.  Bad juju", "Jesus Christ. OP, you are absolutely TA and you\u2019re also a shit parent. Taking away your kid\u2019s birthday over some dude\u2019s vase? Obviously not a serious enough slight to lose her electronics but totally cancel her birthday.", "I'd go a step farther. I think OP thinks she is justified, because if she didnt... she'd never have replied to the people asking what daughter did.", "Great. Now I've got [Uranium Fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKVmhaSY1X8) stuck in my head.", "Exactly.  What a major fckng ah.", "I'm thinking the same thing, too. Karma will show up at OP's door, before too long; when the new husband 86s OP for another woman, she'll call her, beg her forgiveness, but to no avail, because she'll not only cut off contact with her, she'll also move states away, disconnect her phone number and delete her social media accounts.\u26a0\ufe0f", "If I were her friend, I'd try to help her figure out how to get out and go NC once she turns 18.", "Even if he didn't break it on purpose to cancel the birthday, the fact that it broke at all is a pretty convenient excuse to be shitty to his step-kid, no? For a terrible parent, that is. A TON of parents take shit like this out on their kids, it's awful. \n\nOp, you even admit that there was no actual proof! Even if there was, the fact that she didn't do it on purpose and didn't act out until she was accused of lying (which is an absolutely valid feeling for her to have ffs), a punishment would be cruel, let alone a *multi-day punishment*. No wonder your ex's family cried abuse at your original punishment. \n\nPlease take a long, hard look at your spouse, and how he treats your kid. Because she isn't *his* kid, he isn't necessarily going to be fair to her. Then take another long look, this time  in the mirror, and ask yourself if all of this is worth losing your kid over; she's not going to forget this cruelty. \n\nYTA for picking your spouse over your kid.", "This is the first comment where I think you actually said it right.  I didn't have the right words in my head when I was commenting pretty much the same thing.  OP canceling her daughter's birthday over something as punitive as a bloody vase is not only showing how superficial OO is but is also instilling her daughter with the sense that celebrating her life is no longer important because she's a bad girl!\n\nOP, if you want to see your daughter how much of a bad girl she can be go ahead and continue this line of disciplinary action choices.", "He probably pays the bills\u2026", "This is what I worry about, too. \n\nOP doesn't have any problem making a major decision without consulting the dad.

Once when I was a child my step-grandmother accused me of taking my pocket knife and just randomly stabbing at the fence in one area. I had nothing to do with it but I got in a shit-ton of trouble.\n\nFast forward a few years and I go back and visit when I'm 18 or 19. We were all on the back porch when I glanced over at that section of the fence and noticed they had stapled some fine chicken wire over the area. I asked step-grandmother what was going on over there, and she replied, \"Oh, the dog was clawing at and chewing the fence, so we put that up.\"\n\nNo apology, no one called me when they discovered it was the dog and NOT me, we just sat there in awkward silence.  That's when I decided to cut them all off.", "What a ride", "Definitely Mother of the Year.", "Exactly. She's terrible. YTA OP.", "OP didn't involve dad in the conversation/decision because their daughter didn't do anything to warrant being grounded. Cancelling her child's birthday celebration is a shitty thing to do, and it's a cruel decision. \n\nThis punishment would maybe make sense if OP's daughter was bullying other children, or if she was sneaking out of the house to get shitfaced. **OP's daughter accidentally broke an antique vase and \"talked back\" to step dad. The vase is her step dads.**. And it was *fucking accident*. There was no reason (besides her calling the vase ugly one time) for them to think she did this on purpose. Was OPs daughter \"talking back\",  or was she simply defending herself from step dads dramatic accusation that she broke the vase intentionally. Makes we wonder how many times step dad has steamrolled over this poor girl, only for her mom to choose dick her own daughter. \n\nBirthdays are so important at that age. **OP is being cruel for no reason, and her daughter is sure as hell gonna resent her for this completely unreasonable, unhinged punishment.**\n\nEdit to add judgment: OP you are TA 100% YTA. I'm not sure how you wrote that entire post without coming to that conclusion on your own (that's honestly concerning). Her dad realizes how completely unhinged this punishment is. ***He isn't enabling a damn thing - he's being a good parent since you're failing to be.*** He is thinking about your daughter's feelings and showing he cares about her. \n\n**Your daughter is going to remember you choosing your husband over her**. It is time to remove your head from your husband's ass. **Put your daughter and her needs above your husbands needs and his overinflated ego**", "Came on here to say the same thing. Nothing warrants taking away your child\u2019s birthday unless they killed someone or did something else that\u2019s just as serious. \n\nIt\u2019s her birthday. She broke one vase. Don\u2019t you realise how sad it is that you believe your daughter doesn\u2019t deserve to celebrate her birthday because of something so trivial? \n\nYou\u2019re teaching her that she can\u2019t make mistakes, and that if she does, she\u2019s not deserving of even the most basic love & care such as celebrating a birthday.", "My mom was the same way. I was about OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s age when she hit me and I hit her back. We ended up in a full out brawl. My brother came in and stopped the fight. She never hit me again after that, instead she would threaten to kick me out of the house. After a few times of that, when she told me to leave, I proceeded to walk out the door. She actually stopped me and asked me where I planned to go lol. I said I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll figure it out but I\u2019m leaving because she wants me to leave.

My dad did this too. We were on holiday in Italy. He stopped the car because I needed to pee outside an appointed rest stop and made me get out. Then they appeared to drive off. I had no idea if they were leaving or parking.\n\nI remember a local priest coming over and checking on me but the language barrier just freaked me out. My dad appeared after a bit, speaks Italian and gets in a total screaming fit with the priest and drags me away telling me \u2018you are lucky we came back.\u2019\n\nHe then shoved me into the car slamming the door on my leg and the priest and some locals followed so I was convinced I was going to get my parents arrested. It is important to note we were from Northern Ireland, this was mid conflict and we came from a Protestant family who were \u2018more British than the British\u2019 types. My dad turned to me and said \u2018you made the Pope angry!\u2019\n\nThe Pope was our bogeyman. I was about 6, and the priest was wearing white. It was Italy. I lived in terror all trip the Pope was coming for us and that my parents would just leave me by the road.\n\nI have really severe agoraphobia as an adult. I also find holidays the most stressful un-fun ever. My parents also enjoyed pulling stunts on my birthday too to the extent I have actually diagnosed PTSD and my birthday is one of the biggest triggers.\n\nMy partner and I went on our first international trip on my birthday this year and the days before  my birthday were lovely. The actual day: the overload between agoraphobia and PTSD meant I just dissociated and my partner of eight years was absolutely freaked out how much day to day  I manage these triggers but how physical and total the combo hitting me was. They thought they ruined things but actually it was just feeling safe enough to feel it all. Odd birthday present but freeing.\n\nMy partner is not Irish so felt terrible laughing at the Pope story but looking back there is a gallows humour for me too. Except my parents did on multiple occasions leave me at the side of Irish roads so it was a pattern. My mum did it on a driving lesson and to this day has no idea how I got back to the city on a Sunday with no money, cell phone or bus service like NBD. I just walked to a pub and when I asked if any taxi firms would take credit, the bar man called his off duty police BIL to drive me.\n\nI am sure it is total coincidence my mother\u2019s car that I gave the plates for got stopped by police and army checkpoints *constantly* for about six months after. But all those little revenges have never filled the void for how scared and unloved and powerless I felt knowing my parents liked to hurt me by taking my joys away, hating marking the day I came to exist and keeping me on eggshells. I remember the panic, the terror, the hopelessness.\n\nI am now no contact. And they know I mean no contact as in signed legal papers to prevent them accessing my dead body but now they send birthday cards. The message is \u2018be careful what you wish for\u2026\u2019\n\nOP and similar parents are always AH. If you really need to *discipline* a child around birthdays you can be much less cruel. For example the party went ahead but perhaps a larger gift is dialled back or kid has to help with clear up instead of just hanging out. But saying \u2018your birthday, day you came into my life is a day I should ignore you\u2019 is always punishment and cruelty.", "Agreed. I\u2019ve always been a supporter of the idea that parents should have to deal with their own trauma before getting children so that they don\u2019t dump their problems into others.", "I\u2019m a divorced Mom and I\u2019ve never understood Moms who think they can tell the other parent what they should do or how they should do it. These are the same moms that often complain that fathers aren\u2019t involved but then don\u2019t allow them any room for negotiation.", "It seems to me that sonce OP knew that the birthday situation was coming up,  why did she not call Dad to discuss the issue and potential punishment.   Obviously you wouldn't call for every single problem that comes up, but if punishment is going to coincide with a birthday or holiday or other visit with Dad, then this should have been discussed prior to issuing punishment.  How can you expect  Dad to be a team player if he is not included???\n\nOP, you , Dad and step dad need to get together in person or on the phone to attempt to discuss an appropriate disposition of the punishment.   And ask yourself,  does the punishment truly fit the crime???  \n\nUnfortunately,  Op, YTA.", "Thank you. I\u2019m also the parent of twins now, and I would just never dream to hurt one of them like that. She was not well.", "At age 15 I broke part of a Waterford wine glass as I was cleaning up for my stepmother and father\u2018s dinner party. She made me drink from the Glass for a month it had a broker jagged edge on it approximately an inch deep.  She said I did it on purpose which is ridiculous.

I dealt with this type of parental abuse growing up. I got accused of things I either had nothing to do with or if there was an accident they just flat out didn't believe me. They irrationally blamed me for things I didn't do. My lack of \"fessing up\" to things i didnt have anything to do with that they thought I did made their punishments progressively worse. They essentially tried to \"break me\" of my perceived lying (I was a kid/teen).\n\n\n Ironically they found out my younger sibling did all the stuff they accused me of without proof years later. They destroyed their trust in me for literally no reason. They discovered this when my younger sibling moved out and told them about it one day when my parents were complaining about me.\n\nThey're still trying to repair their relationship with me after finding out and I just don't want anything to do with them. It crushes them and I just don't care because parents like OP don't deserve the love of their kids if they treat them like this. In their mind they \"just made a mistake\" but they couldn't even conceive of looking at it like that with their own child (who genuinely didn't do it) and now resents the hell out of them.", "The only reason she got to keep her electronics is because her ex and his family got mad because daughter was not able to talk to them. This woman is a crap mother.", "It's also like. There are a lot of things like advocating for yourself, explaining circumstances, not saying awful shit you don't mean just because you're mad, etc., that ideally your kids would learn.\n\nAnd if you ban all backtalk then you're kinda cutting off one of the main ways they would learn that stuff from you.", "I bet the stepfather broke it. OP YTA And that poor girl will cut you off as soon as she can. There is something very very wrong if you think this is reasonable behaviour on your part.", "Right?! She basically said the punishment was because she talked back to her step-dad, not the vase, which means she cancelled her sweet sixteen because she was acting like a teenager.", "[oh...f......shit.   yah, Im done with that.](https://youtu.be/pnsizkVjGm8)", "My mom also did this to me after promising me for years that she would throw me a real party for my sweet 16.

I wasn't cancelling that one.", "My favorite witch story is the one where they threw her in the water so she just swam away. She did end up in jail later though", "Now watch OP try to be super saccharine on her daughters birthday and act like the victim when the daughter doesn\u2019t act overjoyed about being cut off from her friend and dad and having no party or fun on her birthday.\n\nOP: Happy Birthday honey! I know it\u2019s not what you want but let\u2019s try to make the best of it!\n\nDaughter: grunts and is texting her friends who are genuinely wishing her happy birthday.\n\nOP: I\u2019m trying to make this a nice day, you could at least appreciate me enough to look up from your phone. \n\nDaughter:\u2026..I\u2019m texting dad\n\nOP: THAT\u2019S IT!
