Her bday is tomorrow. And this is her 2nd of punishement. I cancelled her birthday as part of punishment and the other part is not allowing her to go out for 4 days. She still has electronis available.\n\n\nEarlier today, My ex contacted me and asked about the bday cancellation. I told him what happened and he said that he'll throw her the bday party since I cancelled. I said that he can't throw her the party when she's grounded and isn't allowed to leave the house for days. He called me ridoculous but I told him that he was encouraging bad behavior and acting like the cool parent instead of working with me on fixing these behavioral issues. He said that since he's also the parent then I cannot stop him from throwing her a party and he'll do it tomorrow. We got into a big argument and my husband agrees that my ex is being an enabler. But my daughter's grandparrnts got involved as well and told me I can't stop her dad from celebrating her bday and said that I needed to let it go and suggested I put off the rest of punishment til after the bday. But I refused. I feel like he's undermining my parenting and deliberately going against my input.", "created_utc": 1668537968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw5yvl/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_father_that_he_cant/", "score": 997, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your daughter did something bad enough that it warrants cancelling a birthday party and grounding her on her birthday, then it's bad enough that you and your ex need to discuss the appropriate punishment before giving it and generally get on the same page.  \n\nYou didn't do this.

You can't even be bothered to take away the electronics aside from for school purposes, because then you'd have to do something resembling actual parenting rather than sitting her in front of a TV or smartphone.  *And* you get out of the work of having a party.

Plus, their bad behavior may stop altogether.

Like does she have a habit of doing bizarre things like that?  If so, I'd think OP would've mentioned this. So all of this suggests it was done purely by accident and daughter was punished for defending herself.  YTA.", "I'd like to follow up with OP in 20-30 years.  She'll be wondering why her daughter doesn't have shit to do with her.", "Also if they are in America 16 is a milestone birthday", "My ex once was gifted a glass sword (roughly hewn) by my stepdad while he was using glass cutting equipment. \n\nOne weekend he went away, and when he came back the sword was broken. He was furious, yelling at me and I answered truthfully that I hadn\u2019t touched it all while he was away, I had no reason to, and if I HAD broken it I\u2019d have told him the moment it happened, not pretend it hadn\u2019t happened.\n\nHe never forgave me. And it was only a few weeks later when I was brooding over yetANOTHER thing he accused me of doing, that I remembered that he kept it on top of the cast-iron radiator in our shared room \ud83d\ude11", ">And then backtalking someone calling you a liar, hopefully this woman never gets accused of anything, wouldn't want her backtalking and proving her and her husbands guilt\n\nThat's like the trials they had back in ye olden days for argumentative women. \n\n\"Were you argumentative?\"\n\"No\"\n\"Well you are now!\"", "right?i thought she stole the car or something..", "Especially when we teach our kids to stand up and defend themselves", "\u201cBut I let her keep her electronics!!\u201d", "Oh boy.", "I think her husbands very existence is more important to her then her daughter.

The 4 days seems designed specifically to justify cancelling the party, not at all coincidental.

Seems kind of random.", "I wish I was wrong but between her talking about how she limited communication between her daughter and her ex by taking her electronics in the past to being punished now shows that she gets punished often in big ways. \nIn her post she justified herself with my husband agrees with me and she is punishing her daughter in yet another big way because her husband accused her daughter of something with no proof other then husbands say so."]}
