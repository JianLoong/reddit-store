Her bday is tomorrow. And this is her 2nd of punishement. I cancelled her birthday as part of punishment and the other part is not allowing her to go out for 4 days. She still has electronis available.\n\n\nEarlier today, My ex contacted me and asked about the bday cancellation. I told him what happened and he said that he'll throw her the bday party since I cancelled. I said that he can't throw her the party when she's grounded and isn't allowed to leave the house for days. He called me ridoculous but I told him that he was encouraging bad behavior and acting like the cool parent instead of working with me on fixing these behavioral issues. He said that since he's also the parent then I cannot stop him from throwing her a party and he'll do it tomorrow. We got into a big argument and my husband agrees that my ex is being an enabler. But my daughter's grandparrnts got involved as well and told me I can't stop her dad from celebrating her bday and said that I needed to let it go and suggested I put off the rest of punishment til after the bday. But I refused. I feel like he's undermining my parenting and deliberately going against my input.", "created_utc": 1668537968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw5yvl/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_father_that_he_cant/", "score": 2678, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your daughter did something bad enough that it warrants cancelling a birthday party and grounding her on her birthday, then it's bad enough that you and your ex need to discuss the appropriate punishment before giving it and generally get on the same page.  \n\nYou didn't do this.

You can't even be bothered to take away the electronics aside from for school purposes, because then you'd have to do something resembling actual parenting rather than sitting her in front of a TV or smartphone.  *And* you get out of the work of having a party.

Plus, their bad behavior may stop altogether.

I get that your husband is important to you, but is it common practice to just blame your daughter for things based on speculations?..?
