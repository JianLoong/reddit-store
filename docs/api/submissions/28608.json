Btw I\u2019ve always called him \u201cFred\u201d I just can\u2019t help myself every time I try to call him by another name like \u201cbaby\u201d\u201dbabe\u201d\u201dmy love\u201d just feels weird since everyone we know calls him \u201cFred\u201d even his family. Well my son met him as \u201cFred\u201d and since he always hears everyone call him \u201cFred\u201d he would call him \u201cFred\u201d too.\n\n After 3yrs of dating and eventually moving in together he out of nowhere asked me why I don\u2019t \u201cencourage\u201d my son to call him \u201cdad\u201d instead of \u201cFred\u201d I told him that it\u2019s not my call it\u2019s my son\u2019s, he knows the meaning of \u201cdad\u201d and I\u2019m pretty sure if he wants to call him dad he will maybe he\u2019s not ready yet or he\u2019s just used to call him \u201cFred\u201d like I do and EVERYONE does.He says that somehow it\u2019s my fault for not introducing him sooner in the relationship and for not telling him that he is his dad(that he wouldn\u2019t know it isn\u2019t true since he don\u2019t know his biological dad anyways). \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do now I don\u2019t want my son to feel obligated on calling him dad but I also don\u2019t want to lie to him saying he\u2019s his biological dad.

It seems that that is what he wants.", "NTA. Fred shouldn't force the issue and let it happen naturally, if at all. Also, ffs, if he's so hungry up on \"Dad\" level commitment, why is he not legally committed? He wants the title, but right now he could walk away whenever he wants, no consequences. It'd be a little different if you married and he did a stepparent adoption, but for right now he just seems to want more than he's put up.", "WTF? He is NOT his dad. How creepy.", "NTA- So my partner and I have been together 12 years and he\u2019s been the only father figure to my son. My son calls him by his first name. My partner told him years ago he can call him whatever he wants, even dad, but it was up to him. If he tries to force it the kid will definitely not want to call him dad, it 100% the kids choice. I would say that you to aren\u2019t even engaged, much less married so this guy isn\u2019t even his step dad, so it\u2019s weird he\u2019s trying to push being called dad. My brother is engaged to his current partner and told her daughter she can call him dad if she wants to when they announce their engagement. Her daughter still calls him by his first name, but I\u2019ve been auntie for years lol.", "NTA, I feel like my kids' dad but would never force them to call me that.

They're my kids.", "NTA\n\nPLEASE DON'T EVER FORCE YOUR SON TO CALL SOMEONE AS HIS \"DAD\" WHEN HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE OF HAVING A FATHER IN HIS LIFE.\n\nI was in the same situation as your son. My mom started dating my stepfather when I was just a baby. They were living overseas so we never really had a chance to be close. I call him dad but my heart is really not into it. Because I grew up knowing who my father was but he was never in my life. I don't know the sound of his voice. We never met face to face. So I don't how it is like to have a father. \n\nSo when my mom and my stepdad finally came to where I was living ( my stepdad is of diff nationality and they will be migrating to his birth country) my mom basically pushed me to be this loving daughter. She never understood why I wasnt comfortable. Have I known him all my life? Yes? But do I really know him? No. I grew resentment towards my mother for not understanding how hard it was for me to act like a loving daughter when I was not comfortable at all. So please, tell Fred to stop it. your son will call him \"dad\" when he's ready. Wouldnt it be more meaningful if he does it naturally and on his own rather than Fred or you (if you agrees to what fred wants) coercing him to do so?\n\nDon't make your 6 year old suffer. I'm 30 and I still carry everything.", "OP does the kid know that his stepdad isn't his biological dad or nah", "NTA You were right to be cautious about introductions and you shouldn't lie to your son about his origins. \n\nYou might want to have a conversation with your son ALONE and ONCE. Explaining that Fred wants to be his father figure and if he wants to call him Dad that's fine and if he doesn't he doesn't. Purely because he may just think that Fred is his name and Fred might reject a change in title but don't push it. The title of Dad has different entry requirements for different children.", "I\u2019m honestly nervous about having this talk with Fred I am lowkey scared on how will this end some situations like this could be the dealbreaker and I just feel we all too attached at this point\u2026", "Thank you! This really helps a lot.", "I would never force my son to call him dad if he don\u2019t want to because my mom never forced me to call her husband dad. But in my moms case that was a dealbreaker. They separated because she wouldn\u2019t force us (me and my 2 older sisters) to call him dad but during that time she found out she was pregnant so they got back together I do remember feeling guilty for not forcing myself into calling him dad but once again I wasn\u2019t a little kid I was a teenager back then\u2026", "You\u2019re so right!", "I have mixed feelings because you know the saying \u201cA Dad Isn't the one who created the child.

I just feel a little bit of pressure I don\u2019t know why tbh", "He really sees himself as his biological father. He\u2019s into everything that has to do with my son he makes sure he eats good, he teaches him to be respectful, he\u2019s truly a father figure but when it comes to discipline he prefers to talk to me first when son is behaving bad so both of us can sit with my son and talk to him about what he did wrong.

Your son already sees him as a father figure, but hasn't fully accepted him as his \"Dad\" yet.  He may never, but that's his call to make, not yours and not Fred's.", "Avoiding it won't make it go away. If you let it go on it may end up in resentment from Fred, your son or both.

I genuinely hope Fred gets over it and doesn't give you any further grief about it.\n\nThat said, you are 100% NTA in this situation. I never called my mom's husbands \"dad\", because they weren't my dad. It makes me extremely uncomfortable to even read about Fred's comments and behavior. He's out of line. I hope he treats your son well otherwise.\n\nRegarding your other comment, about whether your son will feel guilty if Fred ends things. Hopefully there will be no ending things and everything is ok! In the worst case scenario, I would simply not mention that issue to your son at all. But again, hopefully it's not even necessary to even be thinking about this.", "I met my boyfriend's 9yo daughter a couple of months ago. I told him that he doesn't get to dictate how mine and her relationship progresses(what she calls me, what kind of bond we have, how much she trusts me and how quickly, etc), that's up to her. It should ALWAYS be the child's choice how the relationship progresses, they're in the position of vulnerability.", "You need to leave this man. He is manipulating ypu and your son.

You seem like a caring mom \u2764\ufe0f. Just take things slowly and continue to prioritize your son. I\u2019m sorry for the circumstances surrounding your own stepparent during your teen years. That is rough for sure.", "Yes, that is true. But insisting that he deserves this immediately, instead of waiting for it to come naturally, is a sign of a deeper problem. That's entitlement.", "Fred hasn't had time to take the responsibility.  He's demanding the label without having done anything to deserve it.\n\nIn any case, a dad is who the kid says is the dad.  If the kid thinks he's \"Fred\", then Fred has to accept that.", "I hope Fred isn\u2019t the kind of guy who thinks if he brings home a check that kid better call him dad.

Our daughter was calling her by her first name but started calling her aunty like her niece and nephew did, so us three grown ups had a chat to make sure we were on the same page then had a chat with our daughter to say she's not your aunty she's more like a second Mummy to you, and together we came up with Mumma (her name) because our daughter needed a distinction between us, and she's since dropped the first name and just has Daddy, Mummy and Mumma.
