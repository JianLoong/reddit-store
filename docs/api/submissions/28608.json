Btw I\u2019ve always called him \u201cFred\u201d I just can\u2019t help myself every time I try to call him by another name like \u201cbaby\u201d\u201dbabe\u201d\u201dmy love\u201d just feels weird since everyone we know calls him \u201cFred\u201d even his family. Well my son met him as \u201cFred\u201d and since he always hears everyone call him \u201cFred\u201d he would call him \u201cFred\u201d too.\n\n After 3yrs of dating and eventually moving in together he out of nowhere asked me why I don\u2019t \u201cencourage\u201d my son to call him \u201cdad\u201d instead of \u201cFred\u201d I told him that it\u2019s not my call it\u2019s my son\u2019s, he knows the meaning of \u201cdad\u201d and I\u2019m pretty sure if he wants to call him dad he will maybe he\u2019s not ready yet or he\u2019s just used to call him \u201cFred\u201d like I do and EVERYONE does.He says that somehow it\u2019s my fault for not introducing him sooner in the relationship and for not telling him that he is his dad(that he wouldn\u2019t know it isn\u2019t true since he don\u2019t know his biological dad anyways). \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do now I don\u2019t want my son to feel obligated on calling him dad but I also don\u2019t want to lie to him saying he\u2019s his biological dad.

How creepy.", "NTA- So my partner and I have been together 12 years and he\u2019s been the only father figure to my son. My son calls him by his first name. My partner told him years ago he can call him whatever he wants, even dad, but it was up to him. If he tries to force it the kid will definitely not want to call him dad, it 100% the kids choice. I would say that you to aren\u2019t even engaged, much less married so this guy isn\u2019t even his step dad, so it\u2019s weird he\u2019s trying to push being called dad.

They're my kids.", "NTA\n\nPLEASE DON'T EVER FORCE YOUR SON TO CALL SOMEONE AS HIS \"DAD\" WHEN HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE OF HAVING A FATHER IN HIS LIFE.\n\nI was in the same situation as your son. My mom started dating my stepfather when I was just a baby. They were living overseas so we never really had a chance to be close. I call him dad but my heart is really not into it. Because I grew up knowing who my father was but he was never in my life. I don't know the sound of his voice. We never met face to face. So I don't how it is like to have a father. \n\nSo when my mom and my stepdad finally came to where I was living ( my stepdad is of diff nationality and they will be migrating to his birth country) my mom basically pushed me to be this loving daughter. She never understood why I wasnt comfortable. Have I known him all my life? Yes? But do I really know him? No. I grew resentment towards my mother for not understanding how hard it was for me to act like a loving daughter when I was not comfortable at all. So please, tell Fred to stop it. your son will call him \"dad\" when he's ready. Wouldnt it be more meaningful if he does it naturally and on his own rather than Fred or you (if you agrees to what fred wants) coercing him to do so?\n\nDon't make your 6 year old suffer.

They separated because she wouldn\u2019t force us (me and my 2 older sisters) to call him dad but during that time she found out she was pregnant so they got back together I do remember feeling guilty for not forcing myself into calling him dad but once again I wasn\u2019t a little kid I was a teenager back then\u2026", "You\u2019re so right!", "I have mixed feelings because you know the saying \u201cA Dad Isn't the one who created the child.

I genuinely hope Fred gets over it and doesn't give you any further grief about it.\n\nThat said, you are 100% NTA in this situation.

That is rough for sure.", "Yes, that is true. But insisting that he deserves this immediately, instead of waiting for it to come naturally, is a sign of a deeper problem. That's entitlement.", "Fred hasn't had time to take the responsibility.  He's demanding the label without having done anything to deserve it.\n\nIn any case, a dad is who the kid says is the dad.

I mean no disrespect about it. In fact, the word \"dad\" is associated with a whole lot of negativity and alcohol problems on my mom's side and long rants about her marriage and just all kinds of negativity. So it's actually a complement to not call him that.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to understand that it doesn't matter whether his biological dad was around or not. Calling another man dad is very very very very very very very very personal. Even if your son never calls him that, it doesn't mean that your son doesn't like him. Only time will tell. Whether your son is six or 16 or 60, it will be up to him what he wants to call your boyfriend, assuming that you guys are still together at that point.\n\nAlso from a personal perspective I think that calling somebody your only just dating for only about a year and calling him dad seems like a really strange push and flex like he wants to try to control things", "NTA", "NTA There is more to being a dad then being called dad. My stepmom forced me to call her mom.  I stopped when I was 18 and moved out. I\u2019m 44 and still don\u2019t call her mom. So if he really wants to build the relationship he will not force it!", "NTA 100%\n\nHie I hope you are doing okay now.\nI want to say, please look and focus at all the facts which are there in front of you, from your mom's family to your personality to your own family, and try not to go pessimistic on everything, second guessing everything in our life and be cynical is second nature to all of us, but once it goes beyond that it gets worse and i guess you already have experienced that.\n\nI am so happy to see your reply to one, on how your son reacts with his friends vs at home, he is smart, observant and sensitive kid, he understands his surroundings. So, please, as everyone here said too, have a conversation with your son without second guessing because he has always been there for you and has seen you the most in your best, okay and worst times, he will definitely understand and answer you in his own way, because you as his parent & caregiver have given him that space.\n\nHave some confidence in yourself, you are doing so well for your kid and for yourself. Really really proud of you. <3\n\nYou will always get support from here from everyone, they literally have your back.", "NTA. \n\nTbh my mom met my first stepfather when I was 3 and he treated me like a daughter but I never called him dad. I tried one time when his 2 other daughter visited us and when he went to work we all wished him a good day, and when his daughter said \"dad\" I tried at the same time to not \"give false expectations\" and it didn't felt right at all. \n\nAnd then he cheated on my mom when I was 10yo and had a daughter with the mistress and he brought the mistress when my mom was at the hospital recovering from a surgery. He demanded my sister (not his) and myself to be asleep. When he came back, we weren't sleeping but pretended and we saw the mistress (who knew that he was in a relationship). \nI never felt like calling him dad during all those years prior to the discovery of his affair and honestly I don't even feel bad. I never knew my dad and my mom didn't pressed me to call the cheater \"dad\"\n\nMy mom is with my now stepfather that raised me since I was 12 (I'm 22) and I consider him as a father even tho I don't call him dad. But it takes nothing from our relationship. He consider me and my sister as his daughter, and when he talk to others, he refer to us as \"my daughters\". My sister had a baby a year ago and she told me that her son will be referring to him as grandpa so it tells a lot. \n\nDad is just a title that don't hold much values nowadays for a lot of people and that's ok. Honestly, forcing your child to refer to him as dad will only bring bad things. \nHow many posts on reddit talk about stepchildren not getting along with their step parents bc they wanted to force the family and the title? There is a lot, and how their relationship with the biological parent? Bad. And a lot of them are gone NC with them. \n\nYour son is still young, he have the time to decide when he's ready to call your partner \"dad\". But also, it's only been 3 years and he's already pushing to be called dad? \nHave a discussion with your son about how he feels about Fred and how he feels about calling him dad one day. Communication is the key, on the relationship and with your son. Time to set some clears boundaries with Fred.", "Ugh. Don't force kids to call step parents \"dad\" or \"mom\". Pretty much ever. \"Dad\" is an honor he has to work for, it's not something you can demand. And doing so almost universally has the opposite effect.\n\nNTA. It is your son's decision and forcing it will destroy any chance of it ever being real.", "NTA. take things slowly and don't force him to call his future stepdad (dad). \nIf you get married and things got serious between you two\nStart using the word dad in front of your son.\nFor example: son could you wake up dad\nDo this until he used to it but never force him to do it.", "NTA, your child should get to choose whether or not he calls your partner Dad", "NTA. He\u2019s not your son\u2019s dad. The two of you aren\u2019t even married, so he has no real commitment to your son. He\u2019s not even the child\u2019s step father at this point. The absolute last thing you should have done was introduce people you are dating to your child early on. Frankly, your partner sounds like he knows nothing about children and needs to do a whole lot of education about what \u201cstep parenting \u201c entails.\n\nYour son needs to be your number one priority. It really sounds like Fred is not a good partner if you are scared of putting your son first. Huge red flag.", "NTA \n\nOnce you are married you could bring it up with your son in a non pushy way such as \u201cNow that Fred and I are married, he would be okay with you calling him dad if that\u2019s something you would like to do.\u201d And then leave it at that - either your son will or won\u2019t.", "YTA - your son is six, not sixteen, and it's a complete cop-out to put all responsibility for decision making on his shoulders.\n\nIf you and Fred are long term, and this makes it sound like that's what Fred wants, then working to foster the familial relationship is part of building a healthy life together.\n\nInstead of saying \"my primary school child has complete autonomy to make decisions without parental guidance\", talk with your son, let him know that Fred loves him, and that if your son wants to call Fred dad that would be okay, and it would mean a lot to Fred, and if your son doesn't feel ready to then that's okay too.\n\nRespecting some degree of autonomy, while also providing the context that a six year old can't independently assess.", "NTA\n\n\nI can see why it's seen as OPs responsibility to approach the topic of calling Fred dad. OP says her son knows the meaning of dad, but is he aware that he is allowed to do so?\n\nThe situation was handled poorly by Fred, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it a red flag by itself.", "This is why Id consider being a step-parent to be a circle of hell I'd never want to be stuck in, you can do all the work and  try your hardest to be in the family but you'll always just be \"Fred\" and never Dad. All the comments just prove it too, you'd just be a paycheck.", "I\u2019m gonna comment as a view point of your son here and withhold my judgement for the moment.\n\nMy dad came into my life when I was very little. He and my mom married when I was 3, I knew at 6 he was not my biological father I knew the whole time. Kids are smarter than we give them credit for.\n\nNow none of that mattered, my parents never forced me to call him dad right away they let me ease into it. I was 9 when he adopted me and it was MY choice. If I had told them no or the judge no they would of respected my choice even if their feelings would of been hurt. \n\nFred cannot force his way into this role, it must be your son who wants him to. You run the risk of your son growing to resent not only Fred for taking something he doesn\u2019t deserve but you as well for not considering how he feels. Bottom line is your son is the only thing that matters and if Fred needs to go then show him the door.\n\nNo man is worth more than your kid.", "NTA. Honestly I find it fucking weird of Fred to suggest you told your son that Fred is his bio dad, and that that choice would have made everything smoother. It's just despicable to think it's okay to lie to a kid just because he wouldn't realise it was a lie, and it's also quite bold of Fred to think that something like that couldn't snowball into something huge some years from now.", "I don't think anyone is an a$$hole in this situation. It is a fine balance between the needs of three different people. OP is naturally protective of her son and wants what's best for him. Fred has joined a close partnership but still feels on the outside and thinks being called Dad would firmly bring him into being part of the family. The son is merrily going along with his life and never wondered why people have certain names. \n\nI think OP could have a casual chat with her son and ask him if he wants to have Fred as his Dad. Give the boy a few days to think about it and then suggest if he likes the idea he could call Fred \"Dad\" or even \"Daddy Fred\". They could have father and son activities or adventures together without OP to help build a closer bond. The son may find it easier to see Fred as his father when doing things together and just call him Dad spontaneously, which would mean far more.", "NTA\n\nYou handled it right. Has Fred told you why it is so important for him to be called \"dad\"? Has he mentioned adoption?", "Agreed, NTA. Step-dad here, have known stepson since he was 3, and we have been a family unit since he was 5. He called me by my name for years, until at 7 he asked his mother why he cannot call me dad.\n\nSpouse said \"You can if you want to\". So since then, I have been \"Dad\".\n\nJust reiterate to Fred that it is indeed your son's choice. He might notice one day how his friends call their male parental figures \"Dad\", and wants in on it. Or not. Not gonna lie, it WAS huge for me to be Dad officially, but I would not love my stepson any less if he didn't.", "Do you think at 6 yrs old he would understand about \u201creal\u201d dad and stepdad?
