OP shared that [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jd16r/comment/j5jpa9r/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). So it would be uncharacteristic for them to post anything about OP.", "NTA. It would be different if he never posted or didn\u2019t even have social media. But the fact that he posts his friends & cars and not you\u2014 that would hurt my feelings too. You deserve to be celebrated and appreciated and shown off to the world!", "INFO - does his social media have a particular angle for him? Eg you mention vehicles - is he trying to become some sort of influencer in that space?? \nPeople who use SM for business / profile will often not show their plus ones. Appearing single tends to be good for follows - or at least there's a popular perception that that's the case. Of course another reason to appear single is to invite flirting, but there are other explanations.\n\nIf he's just posting personal stuff like hanging out with mates but keeping you invisible then that is odd. \nWhat's his explanation?\n\nEdit - I'm sorry you're getting so many harshly worded comments / insults etc. You don't deserve that.\n\nEdit2 oh my goodness talk about a buried lede, you're in a NON MONOGAMOUS relationship?? Of course he wants to be positioned as single on SM to maximize his chances with women. Not sure whether that's as transparent as I like to see in ethical non-monogamy...but as long as the girls he actually gets involved with know he's got a partner then thats the main thing, I suppose. (Do they??)\n\nNAH but yeah the SM thing is not gonna be your biggest challenge in terms of trust.", "NAH leaning a little towards NTA. Mainly just because if he doesn\u2019t want to post about it he doesn\u2019t have to, but there\u2019s no point in keeping saying he\u2019ll do it just to not.", "NAH\n\nI don't think its wrong for you to be upset your partner doesn't post photos of you but at the end of the day it is his account.\n\nYour feeling are valid. I would feel probably feel similar. I would sit down and have a talk about how it makes you feel and then work on moving past it.\n\nIf he doesn't want to post your beating a dead horse", "INFO: even though he doesn't post you, can you tell he's in a relationship when you look at his page?\n\nLike a status\n\nOr your tagged photos of him visible \n\nOr anything?\n\n\nI personally think if you can tell he's in a relationship then it's a you thing. But if you look at his page and it appears he's clearly single and he's hiding your tagged photos then it's a bit suspicious imo.", "INFO: Do you guys have mutuals on these accounts that you posted on? Did he react IRL or online in any sort of way to your posts?", "NAH. I think some people like to post about big things online and others like to be more private. There\u2019s nothing wrong with either one, but I wouldn\u2019t push him to post about it either.", "Has he ever posted about you? If he hasn't, why is this coming up as an issue now?\n\nDo you think he's keeping you a secret?", "NAH. I'm in a similar ish position as you. My boyfriend doesn't really use social media other than snapchat, and when we do something he'll usually post a picture to his story but never with me in it. Although maybe I wish he would every once in a while, I just don't take it personally. I know he's not \"hiding\" our relationship because I've met all of his friends and I know he talks about me to them when I'm not around. He's just a much more private person than I am and I've had to accept that!", "NTA - There are two valid scenarios: 1. He's a bro and uses social media for bro stuff; 2. He doesn't want other chicks seeing tons of pictures and videos with his fiance.", "NTA and idk where the Yta judgements are coming from. If y\u2019all are letting social media ruin your social media that\u2019s on you but not posting your partner even when you\u2019re engaged is very weird. Especially after four years. I\u2019d ask him why he\u2019s against", "Pretty surprised at how many people are answering YTA to this.. it would be more understandable if he just wasn\u2019t the type to post at all, but if he\u2019s posting about other things then he can do this small thing for you. If social media\u2019s not a big deal for him, but it\u2019s important for you, can\u2019t he just post this one (very special) time if it would make you happy?", "NAH, but I think you\u2019re putting too much gravitas on social media. Is he excited in other ways? Calling and texting his buddies? I mean, he proposed to you right? Is there another reason why you\u2019re feeling insecure about this?", "NAH here. He may have good reasons for not wanting to post pictures of you on social media, including a strong desire to maintain privacy about your relationship. \n\nYou see social media as a way of sharing and spreading information; he may see it as something completely different.", "NAH. \n\nYou have a right to feel upset over this, as it does make you feel \"hidden\" he also has that right to protect your relationship from online preying eyes. I would suggest to just let this be. You're excited about being engaged, and he proposed to you on his own(I'm assuming). He may just not want to. My FH doesn't post anything like that about me. He's just tagged in my post. Is that a compromise? Can you tag him, so it still shows up but he doesn't have to post it?", "I can\u2019t really pick a side. It\u2019s odd that he frequently posts, promises to post with you, then doesn\u2019t follow through. Sure, social media is trash. But that\u2019s irrelevant in this case, because your fianc\u00e9 is a frequent poster.", "I would've said YTA just because of the title but I'm going with NTA as you said he posts his friends and vehicles but not you which is quite strange and I'd be concerned too", "His other girlfriend follows him on social media,  and he doesn't want her to find out about you. Duh.", "NTA. People like to be shown love in different ways. I could see you being TA if he wasn\u2019t active on social media but it seems like he is.", "NTA \nI don't post my husband but I don't post a lot. But my status very much shows that I'm married and I reference him occasionally.\n\nI hate to be this person but be sure you are tagging the heck out of him if you are posting him. Make it public. A lot of guys his behind this on social media.\n\nEdit: I say this because a woman i know peripherally found out her fiance was cheating just yesterday because the other girl was posting him smh. I believe trust is relationship cornerstone. But social media gets it, every time", "NAH. This made me laugh out loud. I don\u2019t look at my husband\u2019s FB, but if I do I know I will find the following: 1. Rants about inflation, 2. Pictures of fish he caught, 3. Pictures of his truck. We\u2019ve been together 15 years and this used to bother me but now I think it\u2019s a guy thing and I pay attention to how he treats me and not what he posts. (I do tag him in pics of us and he likes them immediately.) I can\u2019t rule out that he might leave me for an amazing truck, but not gonna lose sleep over it.", "NTA. If he is open about every other main area of his life on SM, it would strike me as odd, too, if he felt some kind of aversion to posting your engagement without at least some sort of simple explanation as to why not. It obviously means something to you, so if it's something he's not willing to compromise on, I feel like its reasonable to expect him to be able to tell you why.", "I only very occasionally post anything with my partner.  Whenever I see couples constantly posting each other and publicly declaring their love via social media it comes across as if they are trying to convince themselves, not anyone else. It\u2019s okay for some parts of you life to be private.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you should measure his love for you thru his social media BUT it does seem weird that he wouldn\u2019t post about an engagement if he\u2019s active on there a lot. Maybe he just likes to keep it less personal and more about his hobbies?", "I realize that I'm the odd ball out, but EVERY time I was in your situation much gut was always right.\n\nThere's NO REASON why you should be hidden or a secret.

My ex husband put so much stake in it. He would try to control how effusive my posts were about our relationship. He wanted constant validation of love and flowery rants about how fantastic things were when reality was quite different. It was also out of my style/character to write that way.
