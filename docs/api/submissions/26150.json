Recently we'd gone for an ultrasound and we found out that it's a girl. We were both very excited but now things aren't going so well.\n\nI got a call from my mother in law, thanking me for putting her in charge for our \"gender reveal party\" and when I'd be sending the money. I was confused and told her we already knew the gender of the baby. She said my wife told her that and they were hosting the gender reveal for the other family members who we haven't told and she thought it was weird that I didn't already know this since we asked her. I was very confused so I went to talk to my wife and she only told me then that she was hosting a gender reveal. I asked who was going to be funding it and she said it would obviously be me, even showing me her ideas, which were pricey.\n\nI immediately shut the idea down because for one, as it stands, I'm the only one working, two, we have a budget which we both agreed to stick to, three, I'm still paying off our mortgage, and finally I'm also putting some into savings for our daughter. All this really takes a toll on the money we have and she knows this so it felt inconsiderate of her. She then told me she can't cancel because she already informed a lot of her friends and it would be embarrassing to have to tell them it's not happening. I told her it'd would be more embarrassing when we both end up raising our child on the streets. \n\nThen the arguing began, and she talked about how she had a right to celebrate our child, how I can't make these decisions for her and how everybody she knew had one so she had to have one too. This isn't our first back and forth about wanting what others have. I didn't say much, I just told her it wasn't happening with the money we had so now we're not talking and she's gone to her mother's place.\n\nI did explain our financial situation to her mother and she said she'd talk to her. It's been two days and she's still not back even after all my attempts at reaching out. Now I feel like I'm a fault because it feels like I'm not man enough to provide for our family. I don't know what do anymore but I'm definitely not funding the gender reveal or at the very least by myself.", "created_utc": 1693778655, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1699tbp/aita_for_shutting_down_my_wifes_gender_reveal/", "score": 4403, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Making decisions about big financial commitments without discussing it with your partner and then behaving like a child when you do not get your way. \n\nYour response to her was mature and appropriate.

She is immature with money unfortunately.", "NTA Is she a toddler?? Why is throwing a tantrum and behaving like she has no fiscal responsibilities at all ??", "NTA.

To keep the peace, offer to co-finance a small gathering in a free location (your home, MIL's home, or a park) with cupcakes your wife and MIL can bake (with some pink frosting on the inside for the reveal) and some punch.  Maybe also some wine (you can get some very tasty wine at very reasonable prices these days).  It doesn't need to be fancy.

The way she went about it is what\u2019s wrong. By your description, whatever she had planned is quite expensive & so you should have been consulted about spending excessive amounts of money.\n\nOne thing that does stand out to me is that you describe your arguments over money saying, \u2018wanting what others have\u2019. Maybe you don\u2019t mean it in this way, but this sounds like something a parent says to a child. It may be nothing & if so, fair enough, but if you are treating her like a child in the way things are discussed or where money goes, that\u2019s a bigger issue imo.", "Definitely NTA but your wife thinks you are... \n\nDo you have any wiggle room in the budget? You could do a potluck party & have guests bring main dishes.

She's very wrong to have attempted to railroad you into a gender reveal party but you've not helped matters by responding as if you are dates splitting a bill (\"it's my money!\") then presenting the false dichotomy of it being no reveal or you are out on the streets. No attempt to meet her in the middle and instead you've alienated her by making it seem like she's not entitled to any social spending at all because she's not working. Why don't you carry the baby and let her go to work? Oh... you can't?\n\nMarriage is a partnership and neither of you are acting like it.

She is carrying your child ffs.", "YTA. Parenthood and marriage are going to be VERY hard for you if this, your first hurdle, is causing such trouble. At 34, not having paid off your mortgage is not a good reason to put the reasonable feelings of your wife (your daughter\u2019s mother) beneath minor financial concerns. IMHO gender reveals are ridiculous. BUT dying on this hill for no good reason makes such silliness pale in comparison.", "ESH because there's no reason a compromise couldn't have been made. She shouldn't have told everyone there was going to be a party without discussing first, but OP shouldn't have just said \"nope, too expensive\" without figuring out a way to make a party happen.

But you could suggest a compromise that does not cost an arm and a leg.", "NTA because your wife didn't discuss it with you beforehand. These things need to be discussed. But maybe a compromise can be made? There are ways to still get that experience as a Mommy-to-Be and budget carefully. Maybe make it a combo gender-reveal and baby shower so that you won't have to fund two parties. And talk about budgeting for it more responsibly. Examples: My church allowed the use of the basement with a full kitchen and plenty of tables for my baby shower for free. Or if that's not an option for you, maybe just have it at someone's house. And there are ways to decorate really creatively with items from a dollar store. A cake can be made cheaply with pink inside (like a simple box strawberry cake) so that when you cut it, the \"gender\" is revealed. Schedule it for the afternoon, around 2-3ish, so that a meal isn't expected, and just put out a fruit and veggies tray with some cheese and crackers for snacking. Tea, lemonade, and water to drink are very inexpensive. The whole thing can be done on a budget without losing the fun experience.", "NTA in the least! The wife and MIL treat you like a combo free cash machine/anonymous sperm donor. I am a mother of three and grandmother of four. Thankfully, the idea of a gender reveal never came up bc it would have been tough for me to happy face it through such trash.\n\nWhenever I see a video of everyone cheering at a gender reveal, I wonder how the crowd would have reacted if the reveal was for the wrong gender. <sarcastic>", "NTA just because (in my opinion) gender reveals are tacky and useless", "NTA\n\nDid y'all see the recent gender reveal where a plane participating in the event crashed and the pilot died?", "NTA at all but I\u2019m curious how expensive her plans could have possibly been.

Why not have a simple celebration with close friends and family in a backyard, and serve cake, coffee and punch or soda? Why does it have to be expensive?\n\n\nOnce the baby is born, you will have lots of celebrations, birthdays, graduations, etc.. You need to compromise and figure out how to celebrate without breaking the bank.", "YTA,,, but not for saying no? She should have communicated this expectation to you, let\u2019s be honest. Pregnancy comes with a mountain of hormones that are easy to dismiss, but impossible to live with. Maybe compromise was possible, maybe not. But there were much better ways to discuss this than by shutting her down.", "ESH. Do I thing gender reveals are ridiculous? Abso-fucking-lutely. But I'm not the one pregnant with your child. You and your wife are gonna need to learn how to compromise. She wants a gender reveal you can't afford, so you've said no to a gender reveal. There is a middle ground. Set a very small budget (maybe $100?), buy decorations from the Dollar Store, make it a potluck BBQ in someone's backyard.", "I feel like there's an ESH vibe, but it really depends. You say you're the only one working, but that's only a fair point under certain circumstances. Did she unilaterally quit her job and has yet to get another? Did she get fired and is still job hunting? Or did you both make the decision that she would stay home and be a homemaker while you provided? If it's the last, then your money belongs to both of you. The other factor is whether this recurring fight is because you're being an unreasonable tightwad. Mortgages take time to pay off. So putting things off and not allowing parties or fun or whatever until you pay off the mortgage is kind of unreasonable. If you are actually living life then that's obviously moot but it really depends on the level of frugality. I know everyone on here is going to poo poo a gender reveal just because they don't like gender reveals, but if your wife wants to celebrate the gender, I don't think that's a crazy request. I've had parties for really stupid reasons and it's just an excuse to get the friends together and have a good time. I feel like there's a compromise here if you're willing to look for it.", "INFO how much will this party cost? Seems like it would be better to just throw a little BBQ in the back yard and have a colored cake (or whatever) than to do nothing. I'm not crazy about gender reveals either, but if your wife and family want to have fun there should be a way to do it on the cheap. I hope you find a middle ground.", "No one in the comments saying compromise. It\u2019s good moment to meet your village. Buy some cheap pizzas and drinks. It\u2019s totally doable to do a party on the cheap. Marriage and children are compromises. And for those saying gender reveals are stupid. I agree instead of celebrating an arbitrary biological organ how about celebrate the coming of new family.", "For both of my kids, we went to Build A Bear, built a bear, and dressed it for their gender.
