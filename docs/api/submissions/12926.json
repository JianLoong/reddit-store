But this idea you *won't even learn to make a basic meal* that you refuse to *pick up a duster or mop* that you basically flat out 100% refuse to do ANY chores or housework or cooking disgusts me. She is financially dependent on you and she knows it, but she's also really dang tired of being your maid! If you're \"so well off\" and you \"could subsidize life without her\" then get a maid!!!

And that since she is unable to financially contribute to the same degree that you do, she's the one who has to do all the chores.  Is that correct?  \n\nI mean, you're essentially refusing to live somewhere she can afford, and as a result you're forcing her to be your maid.  Does that sound about right?", "YTA.

A marriage is a partnership. Your goal should be each of you contribute the best you can to your family stability and household. If only one of you is working, that means the other should be doing almost everything around the house (assuming no kids). If both are working, you split it equally and pool your funds. She\u2019s going to start working, and she doesn\u2019t even object to splitting finances 50/50 as long as you\u2019re doing so in a way that\u2019s financially feasible for her.

Why did you even get married if this is how you view things? I was ready to agree with you that financial contribution is more important than household chores, but a marriage shouldn't be about keeping a list of who contributes the most. The discussion about chores should be completely separate than the discussion about finances. I have no problem with the partner who doesn't have a job doing all the household chores while the other supports the household financially, but when both have a job, the chores should be shared. But *not* according to who makes what. And that should have nothing to do with the rent. You should not have gotten married if you're going to want to split the rent with your *wife* like she's a roommate.

The topic here shouldn\u2019t be what is an Equal split but rather what is an Equitable split, as no marriage is ever going to be able to be 50/50 all the time.\n\nAn Equal split of the rent would be 50/50 whereas an Equitable split would be 75/25 (by the sounds of it) since you are saying you would be making 75% of the income. \n\nAn Equal split of the chores would of course be you do half and she does half. That might work, that might not. If you\u2019re working the same amount of hours and have the same travel time (within reason, an hour drive compared to a ten minute one is much different than 60 vs 45 minutes) related to work, 50/50 on the chores is still equitable. \n\nBut if you work 40 hours and she works 20, then it would stand to reason you should do one third of the chores (since you work twice as much) and she should contribute the other two thirds (since she works half as much and therefore should have more time at home).\n\nIf you haven\u2019t learned how to do the chores, ask your wife to show you. It will go a long way. But expecting her to work and still do ALL the chores makes you TA.

To be frank, I think it's shocking that I earn so much more as I consider her job to be far more important than mine. We don't have separate bank accounts though, we have had joint current and savings accounts since we moved in together (25 years ago - been married for 24 years and have two daughters in their mid / late teens).\n\nI wouldn't dream of suggesting that she should do more housework than me simply because I earn more.

It's important for couples to have discussions about finances and dividing responsibilities, but it's also crucial that both partners are willing to compromise and understand each other's perspectives. Your wife may feel undervalued if you imply that her contributions to the household are less important than yours simply because they don't have a monetary value attached to them.\n\nWhile it's true that financial stability is essential, house chores and emotional labor play a significant role in maintaining a healthy and happy home. Perhaps you both could have a calm, open conversation about your expectations and reach a compromise that feels fair to both of you. This might involve finding a less expensive apartment that still meets your needs, or dividing expenses and chores in a way that takes into account your differences in income.\n\nIt's essential to approach these conversations with empathy and understanding, rather than trying to \"win\" the argument or proving that one person's contributions are more valuable than the other's.

Rent and household expenses are usually split on a percentage-income basis in a majority of relationships. Sometimes it\u2019s 50/50, but that\u2019s usually when there isn\u2019t such a GIGANTIC GAP between the two incomes, or when the place of residence is within the means of the lowest-income earner. Housework, however, is definitely a 50/50 split unless there\u2019s some kind of physical or mental disability preventing this, or one partner\u2019s work hours simply don\u2019t allow for an appropriate rest/work contribution. Usually the partner that can\u2019t contribute to the physical cleaning and daily upkeep of a home/meals will then provide a greater financial portion to the pot, it\u2019s true. But you have not indicated any such disability or time constraint in the above post. Just a general unwillingness to perform basic normal tasks, or to even learn how. Couple that with the misogyny displayed in your disdain for the partner performing the tasks, this makes you the AH. When you\u2019re the only one cooking and cleaning, it\u2019s a full time job. If she\u2019s going back to work you either need to step up and do your job with half of the chores, or pay for assistance for your partner so she doesn\u2019t have to work two full time jobs.

Your wife would prefer to downsize so not all of her income is absorbed by this \"equal\" 50/50 split, but you refuse because you like living expensively.\n\nThe simple fact is you seem to be irrelevant to your own household beyond your financial contribution.

Looking at the issue ESH.\n\nLearn to discuss about your needs and wants without veiling them to pseudo-objectivity.", "A point that a lot of people here seems to miss, is that partnerships between people, *are* inherently transactionable.\n\nMeaning, all partnerships are to some extent based on some sort of transaction, stereotypically that women exchange looks, sex and intimacy for men providing financial security and physical protection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is often how many partnerships work out from the onset, which is very much a transaction and objectively it quacks like a zero-sum-game.\n\nDoes that mean that all partnerships are a zero-sum-game of transactions? Of course not. The \"partnership\" part that other posters base their YTA verdict upon, is exactly the point they try to put words to.\n\nIdeally a partnership (speaking of heterosexual partnerships) is a non-zero-sum-game, where the transaction of looks, sex and intimacy for financial security and physical protection, results in an outcome which is more valuable for each party than the sum of the individually contributed parts (the definition of a non-zero-zum game, in this instance the result that is more than the sum of the individual parts would be descriped as \"mutual affection\" or simply just \"love\").\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I agree that a partnership *ought* to be more than the sum of its parts, though I also acknowledge that it is up to each couple to make that decision for themselves, e.g. I can't make a verdict whether a specific couple find their parthership to be zero-sum or non-zero-sum.\n\nHowever, in order for any kind of transaction to function, the contribution needs to be equviable in percieved value - not neccesarily exactly equal, but at least such that no party feels they contribute more than the other party.\n\nI firmly believe that having a conversation with your partner about how each of you contribute to the partnership is a good and healthy conversation to have, because if you don't have that conversation, you might find yourself in a situation where either of you feel the contribution is unequally distributed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all this and before anyone jumps to the conclusion that I weigh everything in this manner, no, I don't percieve everything in life strictly as a transaction;\n\nI'm just pointing out that at its core you *can* weigh everything as a transaction and if you want to decide if you are getting screwed in a social setting, you *should* weigh that interaction as a transaction - that is how you conciously figure out if you are getting used and abused by your \"friends\" or partner (and is also the reason why when people feel their partnership or friendships are unequal, because they actually *are* contributing more to that social interaction than the other party does).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in OP's case, is he the asshole? ; (Assuming they both work the same hours at their job each week)\n\nI believe it is fair for his partner to ask for splitting housley duties.\n\nI believe it is fair OP says \"I earn X amount and want Y lifestyle\".\n\nI belive it is fair OP's partner says \"I yearn Z amount and can't pay half of Y lifestyle upkeep).\n\nI believe it is fair ***if OP said*** to his partner \"if you pay less than half of Y lifestyles upkeep, you also do more than half of the housely duties\" -> \n\nThis would mean OP's partner gets the lifestyle of Y, only pays what she can and the housely duties are distributed in comparison to the financial burden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they can't agree to splitting of financial burden versus lifestyle standard versus housely duties, then they have a problem with expectations of their living conditions.\n\nIf OP's partner want's to split *everything* 50/50 and *she* sets the standard of what lifestyle is affordable according to *her* income, then it is no longer a conversation, but an ultimatum from her side.\n\nIf OP insists on splitting *everything* 50/50 etc. etc., then OP is not having a conversation any longer, but setting an ultimatum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion: Social interactions are complex, as are people. You can't make a verdict of a situation that is not explained in detail and in a case of an eleven year relationship there are a lot of details (there also seems to be a slight language barrier).\n\nSo, I don't think OP neccesarily is the asshole here, but depending on how and what exactly OP wants from the arrangement, he *could* become the asshole rather quick.", "I'm a bit confused.

This is such patriarchal bs.", "YTA.\n\nAlso, to answer your question...\n\n>Why does half the people here misunderstood this post for my wife trying to make me do the house chores lol ??\n\nBecause you're a really shitty communicator who can't piece together a coherent argument, that's why.\n\nBut back to you being an AH - yes, you're an AH because you're basing it on money and not time.\n\nGoing to school (plus whatever additional work she does) IS HER JOB.  It requires time and energy away from household tasks, just like when you're at your job, and it will eventually go towards the overall improvement of your household when it allows her to earn larger income just like the money you earn goes towards the overall improvement of your household.\n\nWhat if your wife made multiple real estate investments and started earning a passive income renting those out and started out-earning you by a significant amount.  It literally requires no effort or time on her part other than maybe a couple of hours a month for invoicing and bookkeeping.  But since she's now the financial breadwinner making more money than you, according to your argument that means maintaining the household falls on you since earning money is more important and absolves the money-earner of all other responsibilities.  So even though your job may require 40 or more hours a week of your time away and hers may require a mere couple hours a month in this scenario allowing her all the free time in the world - according to you time is of no significant value and shouldn't factor into the equation.\n\nTime has value and it is a limited resource.   What a person earns is largely arbitrary and based on what society decides to value and think that type of work should earn.  You could just as easily earn peanuts compared to what she would make if society decided your type of work isn't worth the significant pay it is right now.  A good example of this is social work.  Social workers have to have a significant amount of education and end up making shit wages despite long hours, huge caseloads, and the important work of keeping our most vulnerable population safe.  But since social work isn't something executives can profit off of, we pay them far less than what we pay programmers who sit on their asses all day making apps that let us be even lazier and matching games that make money for the CEOs.", "YTA.\n\nFirstly, the \u201ctasks\u201d she\u2019s asking to talk about splitting _are the chores_. Currently your wife is working (for example) 20 hours in the home plus 20 hours studying plus 2 hours cooking dinners at home each week (42 hours of total work), while you are working 40 hours at work plus 2 hours at home doing garbage and fixing things (42 hours of total work). You are both working the same amount, just some of your work is out of the house while all of her work is in the house.\n\nBut that is soon to change; your wife will not be studying but will be working outside of the home, which means that to keep your workloads equal you will both be working more hours in total: the 20 hours of work in the home still need to be done, but now it will be split between you both in the evening and weekend. So if you both work 40 hours, you both need to work 12 hours at home to keep up with chores (2 hours you were already doing + 10 hours of shared chores).\n\nYou share the chores because you are partners, and is not reasonable or kind for two people in a relationship to both work 40 hours per week, and then come home and one person does all the household work while the other watches TV. For one person to work 62 hours per week while the other works 42. If you are both working the same amount, you need to split the housework evenly.\n\n_Separate from this_ is the issue of finances. If you are not sharing finances, then there are two ways to split finances that are fair to everyone.\n\nThe first is that you split your expenses proportionally: if you make 70% of the household income and she makes 30% of the income, then that is the proportion you each pay. It\u2019s what you are doing right now, where you make 100% of the income. Everyone pays to their own means.\n\nThe other option is that you split expenses 50-50, but if you do this the expenses need to be based on _the lower income_: an apartment, a car, etc, that she can afford to pay on her salary and still have money left over. This is where your wife is talking about a cheaper apartment. It is not _fair_ to ask your wife to give all of her income to paying the rent, while you have money left over to spend on yourself.", "INFO: How does your doing your half of the chores have anything to do with all the \"what if I lost my job\" argument? Do you honestly think you risk your health and ability to earn money if you fo YOUR HALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD?\n\nYou both work full time = you both do 50 % of the household.  It doesn't matter who earns more unless you pay her for doing your work.", "YTA if you earn more you should pay more of the rent and if you both contribute to the rent regardless of how it is split the housework should be equal.", "OP you are an AH.  her TIME should be thought of as equal in value to yours, even if the economy doesn't pay her as much as it pays you.", "I see the issue here. You think money equals chores, instead of time equals chores. If you both work 40 hours, you should both do the same amount of chores. It doesn't matter how much money your 40 hours brings in or hers, it's about the time itself.

He will live in a different house, but will have the exact same job, career, salary, retirement plan... OP's argument makes no sense.", "I do t think you need to switch to a lower paying job to get a cheaper rent.", "YTA. Why did you post just to argue with everyone?", "This is what my spouse and I do. He makes more than me, but we throw everything into the same account and pay all bills/expenses from that. However, he and I have very similar views about spending and saving.  I know people who do not, so they keep everything separate with their partners.", "Well we can certainly agree on one thing - you clearly can't please a woman in anything lol.", "Wash the dishes you lazy fuck", "You've missed the point of why your wife is so upset. You don't value her contributions to your shared life, at all. That's heartbreaking.", "If you\u2019re this much of an argumentative, nit-picking jerk when she\u2019s trying to have serious conversations with you about the future of your marriage, I can see why she\u2019s so worried you\u2019re going to try to screw her over. Do you want to be single? Because this is a great way to accomplish that.", "In his own words, it won't make a bit of difference in his day to day life. She deserves someone who actually likes her and wants to be with her.", "\"You work the same hours as me, but make less money than me, so you should make up that financial difference by being my maid and cook.\" Hope he's ready to have a wife that wont have sex with him. She'll be too busy making up the difference \"he feels\" she owes him!", "He said he is ok with that as long as does a proportionate amount of household chores. She is fighting him on that too though.", "I know it makes no sense I have a strong dislike for op in general that's why in my first comment I said he's an AH however to play devils advocate if op comes from a background of being poor/struggling people like that tend to see downsizing as a bad thing", "He must believe that if uou get a raise or make x amountnof money, then your apartment or house should reflect that. You shouldn't be living frugally or cheaply if your rich. \n\nHe wants his life, house, car, vacations ect, to reflect the amount of money he makes.", "None said anything about switching to a lower paying job to get lower rent tho", "I know married and cohabitating couples like this because the do not have the same views with finances. It works for them, so cool.  But, I am so glad that my spouse and I pool our money together without any issues. So simple and less stressful.", "A transactional relationship is more about treating the relationship as a business and keeping track of what one partner gives or takes from the other. (And transactional people see all relationships as transactional). OP clearly does that to an extreme level. \n\nWith love based relationships, the couple generally acts as one. If my partner is tired, I\u2019ll massage their feet without expecting anything in return. And vice versa. That\u2019s quite a different mindset than massaging my partner\u2019s feet while expecting her to reciprocate or keeping track of how many more times I\u2019ve done that than her.", "No, it wouldn't. Transactional relationships are like business deals and aren't focused on building the connection/relationship. Both partners are concerned about what \"benefits\" they are getting from the relationship and are self-serving, making sure they never give more than they get back. The idea of giving without expecting anything in return goes out the window and love without conditions isn't even considered. It's a very cold outlook on what should be a loving relationship.", "If you are with someone for what they do for you as opposed to being with them because you love them for who they are you need to dump them and hire people to do the shit for you that you don't want to do for yourself. \n\nHealthy relationships are NOT transactional.", "Conditional isn\u2019t the same as transactional", "This is not true. You need to Google search \"transactional relationships\" because you don't understand what the term means.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Yup! A study from 2022 estimated stay at home persons would be paid a 150k salary if paid market value. \n\nBased on their rent of 2k and assuming 3xs rent as average salary, op could not afford to pay his wife for her unpaid labor that he is so quick to dismiss as actual work.", "Why are you so hung up on the word \"equality\"? You're having an unusually intense reaction to it's use.", "People are not misunderstanding you here dude. They are understanding, and still think you are the asshole.", "You\u2019re fight is over semantics. Which is ridiculous. You understand the point but just need to ensure you\u2019re right because it\u2019s not called equal it\u2019s called proportional. But all this concern over terminology doesn\u2019t help in making a fair and equitable split for the household, it just makes you an asshole, sound like an insufferable jerk, and hurt your relationship with your wife.", "you\u2019re an absolute AH.", "Here's another hypothetical for you. You seem fixated on things being even, what if your wife was to get in an accident that limits her physical capabilities. Would you expect her to pay bills in order to make up for not being able to help around the house?", "This isn\u2019t a hypothetical situation. This woman is married to OP, is financially dependant on him, and she doesn\u2019t want to be. OP thinks that because he brings in more money, he doesn\u2019t need to do house work. When they both would be working the same amount of hours. Only way he finds it fair, is it she pays 50%. Which she can\u2019t afford. \n\nNothing from OP says she spend money on whatever she wants. The way he talks about her, he doesn\u2019t seem to even like her.", "Because it shouldn't be based on income, it should be based on hours. If they're both working full time, they pay % based on their income and split the chores 50-50 since they both work full time. The income amount doesn't correlate with the amount of chores, otherwise, a high paid 20 hour a week job would have less chores than a low paid 40 hour a week job. That makes no sense.", "Where?", "How is he \u2018going down to her level\u2019 and \u2018throwing away years of work\u2019 then? It makes no sense.", "It\u2019s also more fair. My mom worked 50% for almost her whole life, so she could be there to pick us up from school and do housework, while my dad had a high paying job with long hours. He was able to do this job, because my mom worked part time. The money he made doing that job was 50% hers. In marriage you are a team. If you think the money you made because you did the work for a company is 100% yours to spend how you want, then in my opinion- you aren\u2019t in a partnership.\n\nBut then again, I also wouldn\u2019t be able to marry someone who has a totally different view on finances and also has different spending habits (which is what you mention would be a reason for keeping things split).", "Lol ofc that it works for the party that makes less, particularly when they make *significantly less*, no shit. \n\nThe other party is probably going with it to keep the peace or for the sex or cause there's an unspoken house/parenting split they enjoy (if money doesn't get ~nickle and dimed, why keep a tally of the times one picked up a mop? you're either keeping score or you're not). \n\nOP sounds like he really hates housework and he wants to negotiate some option where he buys out of it. I don't see that as so unreasonable, considering it's implied he makes significantly more, so he's earning the financial power to do so. If his wife doesn't want to do the leftover chores, then they should hire a part-time maid with his leftover money, cause it's his money, and it's his problem w/ housework that is in need of being addressed. \n\nPersonally, I despise chores and the moment I can outsource to anyone else I will, even before going for some other more common life upgrade. It's a continuously trite time suck that people should be able to buy their way out of if they can afford it. We supposedly live in a technologically advanced society, yet you're all acting like there's no possible rational recourse but for a high level programmer to personally handle the mop?\n\nThe entire point of expensive skilled labor is that you can advantageously trade it for someone else doing less yielding lower skill labor. They don't pick their own fruits, they don't spin their own fabric or make their own clothes, presumably, so why is him holding a mop the hill to die on?\n\nThe wife can do all of it if she chooses, and in return she lives in a more affluent household than she would otherwise. Or she doesn't have to do it, but then they go 50-50, him matching her and doing with the surplus whatever the hell he wants, including hiring someone else to do his chores.", "Ah.  I see now.  Meh, why would ypu want to treat the relationship as a business?", "There's nothing wrong with keeping score if the score *is fair*. The people who whine about score-keeping are moochers who aren't pulling their own weight and would prefer their behavior not be logged for overview.", "This is absolutely right. Too many people search for partners based on what they can do for them and not for love.", "healthy relationships are *EQUALLY* transactional. you do things for your spouse, they do things back for you, and you have a healthy relationship. sometimes you tackle things together, sometimes one handles it for the other, but their ALWAYS is fundamentally a transaction going on, even if its not the most obvious on the surface.", "She\u2019s totally willing to split the rent if it\u2019s an amount she can afford. He is unwilling to live anywhere cheaper and wants to keep her dependent on him\u2026 and as his maid.", "I really really hope your wife does really well in her new job so she can ignore the housework like you do since it\u2019s not important. Then she can take all her nice new earned money and get her own apartment away from your misogynistic, asshole self.", "yeah this guy is just hung up on proving to his wife and the whole world that he\u2019s just better than her.", "It is a hypothetical situation because she isn't working yet and hasn't for 11 years it's gonna be alittle harder to get a job and there's no talks of her looking for a job yet just that she wants to. That all being said if you want to use the argument of what op did or didn't say in his then be consistent because op did say that he does chores. Op also said he has no issues with doing chores. And I can flip your argument back on you, op never said he didn't let her buy whatever she wants and op also never said she doesn't want to \"depend on him financially\" she could be getting a job to help with things or simply because she's bored", "On mobile so i can\u2019t quote it but end of the 5th paragraph. I\u2019ll try and quote it in a sec.\n\nHere we go:\n> but at the same time, I am okay with paying the majority of the rent as long as you compensate that with house chores.\n\n\nFor the record, not saying he\u2019s not an asshole, just saying he did offer to split things.", "For some reason, men do not like this idea, probably because they feel insecure if their partner doesn't NEED them, but in the same breath, they will bitch about women being gold diggers.\n\nGuys, please, pick a fucking struggle.", "But she was totally fine living there, until op said split EVERYTHING equally. Why should they move bc she doesn't make, OR, work as much as OP?", "OP has a huge issue doing chores. He would rather pay someone than learn to do them himself: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ymfa5/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_financial_stability/jd8dykx/", "Oh. So if they both work 40 hours, she has to still work harder at home because money. Very clearly why she wants to live in a cheaper area.", "I don't know buddy, you're going to have to figure out for yourself why someone who can't afford something would change their situation", "No and none is saying it's okay either (except probably op) \nThe problem is equality vs fairness. Op wants equality while everyone else is arguing fairness. That's why I'm pretty sure everyone on this thread has called him an AH he's hung up on equally splitting things.\n\nwhat he's saying is and equal split would be exactly that 50/50 on bills and 50/50 on chores or 70/30 and 70/30\n\nA fair split would be income based for bills and have that have no effect on chores split.\n\nThe biggest problem being op is looking at it entirely $$ wise  and not time wise.", "I get he's caught up on equal that was my point in his argument with his wife he was talking about equal then when  then that commenter said 70/30 would be fair op said I get that but not equal which is what the argument was about"]}
