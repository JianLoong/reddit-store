But this idea you *won't even learn to make a basic meal* that you refuse to *pick up a duster or mop* that you basically flat out 100% refuse to do ANY chores or housework or cooking disgusts me. She is financially dependent on you and she knows it, but she's also really dang tired of being your maid! If you're \"so well off\" and you \"could subsidize life without her\" then get a maid!!!

And that since she is unable to financially contribute to the same degree that you do, she's the one who has to do all the chores.  Is that correct?  \n\nI mean, you're essentially refusing to live somewhere she can afford, and as a result you're forcing her to be your maid.  Does that sound about right?", "YTA.

A marriage is a partnership. Your goal should be each of you contribute the best you can to your family stability and household. If only one of you is working, that means the other should be doing almost everything around the house (assuming no kids). If both are working, you split it equally and pool your funds. She\u2019s going to start working, and she doesn\u2019t even object to splitting finances 50/50 as long as you\u2019re doing so in a way that\u2019s financially feasible for her.

Why did you even get married if this is how you view things? I was ready to agree with you that financial contribution is more important than household chores, but a marriage shouldn't be about keeping a list of who contributes the most. The discussion about chores should be completely separate than the discussion about finances. I have no problem with the partner who doesn't have a job doing all the household chores while the other supports the household financially, but when both have a job, the chores should be shared. But *not* according to who makes what. And that should have nothing to do with the rent. You should not have gotten married if you're going to want to split the rent with your *wife* like she's a roommate. You are talking like you think you are better than her because you make more money.", "YTA this time. The topic here shouldn\u2019t be what is an Equal split but rather what is an Equitable split, as no marriage is ever going to be able to be 50/50 all the time.\n\nAn Equal split of the rent would be 50/50 whereas an Equitable split would be 75/25 (by the sounds of it) since you are saying you would be making 75% of the income. \n\nAn Equal split of the chores would of course be you do half and she does half. That might work, that might not. If you\u2019re working the same amount of hours and have the same travel time (within reason, an hour drive compared to a ten minute one is much different than 60 vs 45 minutes) related to work, 50/50 on the chores is still equitable. \n\nBut if you work 40 hours and she works 20, then it would stand to reason you should do one third of the chores (since you work twice as much) and she should contribute the other two thirds (since she works half as much and therefore should have more time at home).\n\nIf you haven\u2019t learned how to do the chores, ask your wife to show you. It will go a long way. But expecting her to work and still do ALL the chores makes you TA.

To be frank, I think it's shocking that I earn so much more as I consider her job to be far more important than mine. We don't have separate bank accounts though, we have had joint current and savings accounts since we moved in together (25 years ago - been married for 24 years and have two daughters in their mid / late teens).\n\nI wouldn't dream of suggesting that she should do more housework than me simply because I earn more.

It's important for couples to have discussions about finances and dividing responsibilities, but it's also crucial that both partners are willing to compromise and understand each other's perspectives. Your wife may feel undervalued if you imply that her contributions to the household are less important than yours simply because they don't have a monetary value attached to them.\n\nWhile it's true that financial stability is essential, house chores and emotional labor play a significant role in maintaining a healthy and happy home. Perhaps you both could have a calm, open conversation about your expectations and reach a compromise that feels fair to both of you. This might involve finding a less expensive apartment that still meets your needs, or dividing expenses and chores in a way that takes into account your differences in income.\n\nIt's essential to approach these conversations with empathy and understanding, rather than trying to \"win\" the argument or proving that one person's contributions are more valuable than the other's.

Rent and household expenses are usually split on a percentage-income basis in a majority of relationships. Sometimes it\u2019s 50/50, but that\u2019s usually when there isn\u2019t such a GIGANTIC GAP between the two incomes, or when the place of residence is within the means of the lowest-income earner. Housework, however, is definitely a 50/50 split unless there\u2019s some kind of physical or mental disability preventing this, or one partner\u2019s work hours simply don\u2019t allow for an appropriate rest/work contribution. Usually the partner that can\u2019t contribute to the physical cleaning and daily upkeep of a home/meals will then provide a greater financial portion to the pot, it\u2019s true. But you have not indicated any such disability or time constraint in the above post. Just a general unwillingness to perform basic normal tasks, or to even learn how. Couple that with the misogyny displayed in your disdain for the partner performing the tasks, this makes you the AH. When you\u2019re the only one cooking and cleaning, it\u2019s a full time job. If she\u2019s going back to work you either need to step up and do your job with half of the chores, or pay for assistance for your partner so she doesn\u2019t have to work two full time jobs.

Your wife would prefer to downsize so not all of her income is absorbed by this \"equal\" 50/50 split, but you refuse because you like living expensively.\n\nThe simple fact is you seem to be irrelevant to your own household beyond your financial contribution.

Looking at the issue ESH.\n\nLearn to discuss about your needs and wants without veiling them to pseudo-objectivity.", "A point that a lot of people here seems to miss, is that partnerships between people, *are* inherently transactionable.\n\nMeaning, all partnerships are to some extent based on some sort of transaction, stereotypically that women exchange looks, sex and intimacy for men providing financial security and physical protection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is often how many partnerships work out from the onset, which is very much a transaction and objectively it quacks like a zero-sum-game.\n\nDoes that mean that all partnerships are a zero-sum-game of transactions? Of course not. The \"partnership\" part that other posters base their YTA verdict upon, is exactly the point they try to put words to.\n\nIdeally a partnership (speaking of heterosexual partnerships) is a non-zero-sum-game, where the transaction of looks, sex and intimacy for financial security and physical protection, results in an outcome which is more valuable for each party than the sum of the individually contributed parts (the definition of a non-zero-zum game, in this instance the result that is more than the sum of the individual parts would be descriped as \"mutual affection\" or simply just \"love\").\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I agree that a partnership *ought* to be more than the sum of its parts, though I also acknowledge that it is up to each couple to make that decision for themselves, e.g. I can't make a verdict whether a specific couple find their parthership to be zero-sum or non-zero-sum.\n\nHowever, in order for any kind of transaction to function, the contribution needs to be equviable in percieved value - not neccesarily exactly equal, but at least such that no party feels they contribute more than the other party.\n\nI firmly believe that having a conversation with your partner about how each of you contribute to the partnership is a good and healthy conversation to have, because if you don't have that conversation, you might find yourself in a situation where either of you feel the contribution is unequally distributed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all this and before anyone jumps to the conclusion that I weigh everything in this manner, no, I don't percieve everything in life strictly as a transaction;\n\nI'm just pointing out that at its core you *can* weigh everything as a transaction and if you want to decide if you are getting screwed in a social setting, you *should* weigh that interaction as a transaction - that is how you conciously figure out if you are getting used and abused by your \"friends\" or partner (and is also the reason why when people feel their partnership or friendships are unequal, because they actually *are* contributing more to that social interaction than the other party does).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in OP's case, is he the asshole? ; (Assuming they both work the same hours at their job each week)\n\nI believe it is fair for his partner to ask for splitting housley duties.\n\nI believe it is fair OP says \"I earn X amount and want Y lifestyle\".\n\nI belive it is fair OP's partner says \"I yearn Z amount and can't pay half of Y lifestyle upkeep).\n\nI believe it is fair ***if OP said*** to his partner \"if you pay less than half of Y lifestyles upkeep, you also do more than half of the housely duties\" -> \n\nThis would mean OP's partner gets the lifestyle of Y, only pays what she can and the housely duties are distributed in comparison to the financial burden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they can't agree to splitting of financial burden versus lifestyle standard versus housely duties, then they have a problem with expectations of their living conditions.\n\nIf OP's partner want's to split *everything* 50/50 and *she* sets the standard of what lifestyle is affordable according to *her* income, then it is no longer a conversation, but an ultimatum from her side.\n\nIf OP insists on splitting *everything* 50/50 etc. etc., then OP is not having a conversation any longer, but setting an ultimatum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion: Social interactions are complex, as are people. You can't make a verdict of a situation that is not explained in detail and in a case of an eleven year relationship there are a lot of details (there also seems to be a slight language barrier).\n\nSo, I don't think OP neccesarily is the asshole here, but depending on how and what exactly OP wants from the arrangement, he *could* become the asshole rather quick.", "I'm a bit confused.

This is such patriarchal bs.", "YTA.\n\nAlso, to answer your question...\n\n>Why does half the people here misunderstood this post for my wife trying to make me do the house chores lol ??\n\nBecause you're a really shitty communicator who can't piece together a coherent argument, that's why.\n\nBut back to you being an AH - yes, you're an AH because you're basing it on money and not time.\n\nGoing to school (plus whatever additional work she does) IS HER JOB.  It requires time and energy away from household tasks, just like when you're at your job, and it will eventually go towards the overall improvement of your household when it allows her to earn larger income just like the money you earn goes towards the overall improvement of your household.\n\nWhat if your wife made multiple real estate investments and started earning a passive income renting those out and started out-earning you by a significant amount.  It literally requires no effort or time on her part other than maybe a couple of hours a month for invoicing and bookkeeping.  But since she's now the financial breadwinner making more money than you, according to your argument that means maintaining the household falls on you since earning money is more important and absolves the money-earner of all other responsibilities.  So even though your job may require 40 or more hours a week of your time away and hers may require a mere couple hours a month in this scenario allowing her all the free time in the world - according to you time is of no significant value and shouldn't factor into the equation.\n\nTime has value and it is a limited resource.   What a person earns is largely arbitrary and based on what society decides to value and think that type of work should earn.  You could just as easily earn peanuts compared to what she would make if society decided your type of work isn't worth the significant pay it is right now.  A good example of this is social work.  Social workers have to have a significant amount of education and end up making shit wages despite long hours, huge caseloads, and the important work of keeping our most vulnerable population safe.  But since social work isn't something executives can profit off of, we pay them far less than what we pay programmers who sit on their asses all day making apps that let us be even lazier and matching games that make money for the CEOs.", "YTA.\n\nFirstly, the \u201ctasks\u201d she\u2019s asking to talk about splitting _are the chores_. Currently your wife is working (for example) 20 hours in the home plus 20 hours studying plus 2 hours cooking dinners at home each week (42 hours of total work), while you are working 40 hours at work plus 2 hours at home doing garbage and fixing things (42 hours of total work). You are both working the same amount, just some of your work is out of the house while all of her work is in the house.\n\nBut that is soon to change; your wife will not be studying but will be working outside of the home, which means that to keep your workloads equal you will both be working more hours in total: the 20 hours of work in the home still need to be done, but now it will be split between you both in the evening and weekend. So if you both work 40 hours, you both need to work 12 hours at home to keep up with chores (2 hours you were already doing + 10 hours of shared chores).\n\nYou share the chores because you are partners, and is not reasonable or kind for two people in a relationship to both work 40 hours per week, and then come home and one person does all the household work while the other watches TV. For one person to work 62 hours per week while the other works 42. If you are both working the same amount, you need to split the housework evenly.\n\n_Separate from this_ is the issue of finances. If you are not sharing finances, then there are two ways to split finances that are fair to everyone.\n\nThe first is that you split your expenses proportionally: if you make 70% of the household income and she makes 30% of the income, then that is the proportion you each pay. It\u2019s what you are doing right now, where you make 100% of the income. Everyone pays to their own means.\n\nThe other option is that you split expenses 50-50, but if you do this the expenses need to be based on _the lower income_: an apartment, a car, etc, that she can afford to pay on her salary and still have money left over. This is where your wife is talking about a cheaper apartment. It is not _fair_ to ask your wife to give all of her income to paying the rent, while you have money left over to spend on yourself.", "INFO: How does your doing your half of the chores have anything to do with all the \"what if I lost my job\" argument? Do you honestly think you risk your health and ability to earn money if you fo YOUR HALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD?\n\nYou both work full time = you both do 50 % of the household.  It doesn't matter who earns more unless you pay her for doing your work.", "YTA if you earn more you should pay more of the rent and if you both contribute to the rent regardless of how it is split the housework should be equal.", "OP you are an AH.  her TIME should be thought of as equal in value to yours, even if the economy doesn't pay her as much as it pays you.", "I see the issue here. You think money equals chores, instead of time equals chores. If you both work 40 hours, you should both do the same amount of chores. It doesn't matter how much money your 40 hours brings in or hers, it's about the time itself.

You misread.", "To me the wording makes it sound like her issue is with the request for **half**, when she will not be able to afford that on her salary. She is happy for them to move somewhere she can afford to split the rent.", "Price out the cost of a DAILY housekeeper and a DAILY professional chef. Add that total to your wife's future income and see how \"equal\" your finances are then. Considering you'll both be full time employed and she'll be doing everything on top of working.\n\nYou seem to believe that value and contribution only comes in terms of financial contribution. Every comment you write is seething with arrogance. Yuck.", "You seem to have trouble seeing how sneering OP is and they even edited \"wtf this isn't about CHORES people!\" when they literally said \"Today she randomly brought the topic of how are we going to \"split the tasks\" once she starts working.\"\n\nsplit the tasks can only mean OP doesn't contribute to the chores. What an asshole.", "No, she actually won\u2019t be less happy. She\u2019ll be able to work and split housework with her partner like equals do in an adult relationship, instead of being a maid to her husband in addition to working full time.\n\nHonestly this post makes me scared for her. You clearly have a desire to prevent her from being financially independent. I hope she can get away from you.", "You\u2019re an idiot. This isn\u2019t how relationships work.", "Easy peasy.  Both work or both sit.  Nobody gets to kick back while the other is busting.", "It\u2019s not \u201ctheir money\u201d unless they both decide that\u2019s how their finances will work.\n\nDon\u2019t tell people how to be married lmao", "You asked what would be fair not what would be equal.  Even with proportional splitting you will still come out ahead with more money etc at the end of each month.  Seem way more hung up on equality than having a happy home life with your partner.", "And you're willing to make your wife feel worthless over semantics?", "You both EQUALLY live in the home so the maintenance of that home should be 50/50 split. Where you spend your time has nothing to do with pay. They are two different things. You dirty the house equally and eat the food equally so you should equally divide the clean up and meal prep. \n\nPaying the bills should be prorated based on the compensation of each partner, especially if the home is above the financial means of one (if finances are split).", "Because the \"proportion splitting\" is EQUITABLE.  Being equal is not always synonymous with fair.  Equitable (or proportion splitting) is. \n\nIf you make $2k/ month and she makes $1k/ month, $500 from your income is not the same as $500 coming from her prospective income.  \n\nAnd saying equal effort in quotation marks in regard to her future work sounds like you are looking down on her since her income will likely be less. But I'm sure she's would still put in 100% effort at her job as you do,  so why should she be required to put in more effort at home just because she earns less?! Honestly, you don't write life you do appreciate what she does in the house now and feel superior because you are the sole breadwinner. You should value and support your spouse in whatever they do. I say this as the current breadwinner in my household (who still does the majority of chores). Going tit for tat like this is not how you have a healthy relationship.  Your communication has broken down. Fix it.", "So the #1, single most important aspect of all this to you is that your wife never forgets for a second that she's your lesser. Cool, got it!", "YOU ARE MARRIED. Under the law your money is her money. You are trying to keep her trapped in this set up with no recourse. Why? Because you\u2019re an asshole", "Dude you live in the real world and not in a fucking computer programm.", "Chores are split based on the amount of time both partners spend on their jobs, not the amount of money their jobs make. This is because jobs are compensated unequally in this world even when they require the same amount of effort/time. What is equal is that we all get the same 24 hours in our days. \n\nFor example teachers earn less than engineers even though they might work the same amount of time.", "I did cover it in my direct comment to your post. Which you ignored.", "50 50 on housework isnt the same as 50 50 with money if one person will be broke and you still have a high standard. You dont treat her like a equal. Equity is more important then equality. If you are been 50 50 she has less. If you pay within the means and do tasks you are really equal.", "It sounds like you think the only value people bring to a relationship is how much money they\u2019re earning (perhaps because that\u2019s the only thing you can \u2018objectively\u2019 measure? You seem to consider yourself very logical and rational\u2026)", "You're already treating it subjectively. The way you evaluate her is based in what you consider valuable contributions, but many people don't care your take on this.", "You're in here arguing with everyone which is against AITA community rules. \n\nEither way you flip it, YTA.\n\nYou want everything your way or the highway. Either she pays what she cannot afford to please you sitting upon your high horse or she makes up for it in sweat. Put yourself in her shoes and hear how ridiculous and selfish you sound.\n\nAlso you sound a bit financially abusive in your post, waving how much money you make in her face to show her \"who calls the shots\". \n\nGreat job on being such a equitable and economically conscious roommate OP.", "This problem IS subjective (like most things are)", "But it\u2019s not economical discussion. In both scenarios your household income/expenses are the same.  If you are both working 40 hours a week you\u2019re arguing who\u2019s time is worth more when you\u2019re not working.  These two things are not related and if you believe they are than you don\u2019t believe your wife is a equal in your relationship.  YTA. \n\nShe should continue doing all of the cooking/chores and pocket 100% of the money she makes.  She should also make you pay for sex since you\u2019ve made this transactional.", "That\u2019s how op wants it to be what are you talking about. He very clearly likes being in control over his wife and making her the maid at home. He is being a sugar daddy.", "Except that this whole debate is because she's getting her own job.  Also, in OPs other posts, he says she had been working as a pharmaceutical assistant until a few months ago when she started school.  So something is fishy here.", "Both partners should contribute financially and in chores, so why can\u2019t they both?

How was that not obvious? They are married. It\u2019s her money too. That\u2019s what happens when you marry someone.

OP does not like either of these options, despite both being fair.", "Again, the conversation between op and his wife was about equally splitting things, not fairly. There's a difference. If me and you go to a restaurant and split a 200$ check equally, we split it 100$ and 100$ between the both of us, requardless of what you ordered. If we split it fairly, then if I ordered 150$ worth of food then and you ordered 50$, then that's how we pay.\n\nSwitch that to op he says if we split the chores equally, then he wants to split bills equally. Ie I do half of everything and pay for half of everything and you do the same. \n\nAll I said was ops talk with his wife wasn't about fairness it was about being equal. He asked the person in the comments he replied to what would be fair then they gave an example and all he said was yeah that isn't equal. Then I pointed out to the guy who replied to that his original post and argument wasn't about fairness it was about equal splitting. I made that comment as in hey you just kinda proved ops point splitting based on income isn't equal", "I mean, I think we\u2019re mostly on the same page, but maybe on different paragraphs. Treating someone fairly does not mean that is has to be equal, but splitting things equally can be fair if everyone agrees to it.\n\nSplitting 50-50 is equal. Splitting proportionally is fair. Splitting 50-50 at a lower cost of living could be both equal and fair.\n\nOP\u2019s getting caught up on \u201cequal\u201d rather than \u201cfair\u201d while not caring about the equality of the chores."]}
