My husband interrupts EVERYBODY. When it's just me, I don't finish what I was saying either. If he asks, I tell him I forgot when he interrupted me. When it's with someone else, after he's done I'll ask the other person to continue. Sometimes they \"forget\" too. Funny thing is, he appears to be oblivious to the whole situation. The only person that straight up calls him out on it every time is our son. I love that kid! lol", "NTA. I would be fine with it the first couple of times. But frequently, that sounds exhausting. You also said she never really bothered to actually change her behavior despite you and her having a proper conversation about it. You\u2019re being petty but let\u2019s be real, most people would be annoyed.", "NTA. You've repeatedly asked her to stop, and she chooses not to.  That is very disrespectful, so now she is facing the consequences of refusing to do what you have asked", "NTA but you and your gf do not seem well suited. She has a behavior that you find rude, disrespectful and to be blunt - you hate it! You've drawn a line in the sand over the behavior. But she continues to cross that boundary because she thinks her behavior is justified. Correcting people and trying to make everything about her are fundamental parts of her personality and if you cannot accept this about her, it's better to end it now because this will NOT change.", "NTA. Does she interrupt other people, or just step on you?  It\u2019s a sign of disrespect or self importance, maybe there are other ways she\u2019s disrespecting you and you\u2019ve gotten used to it and don\u2019t realize it.", "NTA. I eventually reached a point where I would give my ex two rude interruptions before I would simply stop telling my story. Genuinely seemed to me he didn\u2019t want to hear it, and that made me not want to share it. Constantly cut me off to guess what was next, go off on his own story, etc. I would tell him he could just go talk to himself since he didn\u2019t want to hear what I had to say lol. \n\nOf course, we also broke up\u2026 it\u2019s not great for a relationship when one or both parties constantly feel they can\u2019t even tell their partner about their day or share a childhood memory.", "NTA.\n\nPetty? Sure. But if you have had discussions about this before then like ? How else are you gonna get it to stop really?\n\nI had a bf who would interrupt me a lot. In fact we had so many conversations about how shitty and ignored and insignificant it made me feel.\n\nI might have considered doing something like this if he\u2018d even cared enough to ask me about what I\u2019d been saying before.", "NTA. Sounds like you've spoken to her about it and frankly, you shouldn't have to. Not interrupting when people are talking is like 3rd day of kindergarten level politeness. This is basic knowledge.", "It sounds like your gf is either neurodivergent or the least considerate person alive. Either way, she's shown you who she is - are you sure this is what you want?\n\nIf she hasn't been evaluated for physical and mental health she may want to start there if she wants to break this habit but feels unable to do it. NTA", "NTA. \n\nI hope she figures it out.", "NTA. My in-laws literally are the worst about interrupting. She at least cares what you have to say and so will hopefully learn. My approach is to literally just keep talking over them or to semi-aggressively say \u201cas I was saying\u201d and restart. But also if this is a person you want to spend your life with, you may also need to get used to it to some degree.", "NTA. This is so disrespectful and annoying. My ex would constantly do this,wildly switching topics in the middle of my speaking. I'd be like, wtf? He said he had to say it before he forgot. I really think he had undiagnosed ADHD and an AH personality disorder lol", "NTA. Eventually, she may learn to stop being rude.", "NTA \n\nHowever, you might want to set up a signal word to warn her. If she starts to interrupt your sentence, you can simply use that word to warn her that you will stop mid-sentence and not finish the joke/sentence at all.", "NTA. I find this to be a very good consequence to her actions. From what you've stated, it sounds like a constant thing and I would find that extremely rude and disrespectful after having discussions with her and how you feel about it. I'm petty enough not to speak at all until she apologizes for yet another interruption. Oh, now I'm free to speak? Nah, I'll just stare at you.", "INFO how does she react when you tell her it bothers you? Does she try to change or refuse to?\n\nIt\u2019s hard for people to change their conversation styles. My partner still struggles sometimes with interrupting and - watching his extended family interact, it\u2019s easy to see where it came from. It\u2019s a hard habit to change. \n\nIF she\u2019s trying to improve, I would probably not punish her lapses.", "INFO: Is your girlfriend diagnosed with ADHD and/or autism?", "Nta she\u2019s weird", "NTA. It\u2019s incredibly annoying and disrespectful.", "INFO: Does your girlfriend know how serious you are about not liking being interrupted. I know you've had a talk but a serious one? I have the same pet peeve where if I'm interrupted I lose my train of thought so it's annoying to me, but my partner and I talk it out", "INFO: Is she actually interrupting or is this a conversational style difference? I (and a LOT of other people -- this is deeply a cultural norm) tend towards what's linguistically called \"[collaborative overlap](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/25/opinion/interrupting-cooperative-overlapping.html),\" which is basically talking back and forth over each other to show interest and engagement. It's very, very Jewish, very New York, very Mediterranean, very South Asian. Is this what's happening? If so, it can be an issue of both of you adjusting your expectations.", "Info:\n\na.

What was the set up of the joke?\n\nb. does your girlfriend have ASD or anything else that makes it harder for her to interpret tone? Does she do it to other people or just you? \n\nc. does she only interrupt jokes or other things that you state as facts? When she interrupts you, how often does she turn out to \"be the correct one\" and how often does she \"not\"?", "NTA.  I\u2019m guilty of what your GF does and my husband gets tired of my correcting or interrupting him.  I\u2019ve been working hard to notice when I\u2019ve interrupted and apologize quickly and say, \u201cGo on, please,\u201d but I\u2019ve been struggling with hearing myself correct him while in the moment.  He still has to point it out sometimes.  I\u2019ve been going to therapy to deal with the underlying issues (mother related) that make me so quick to jump in and why I seem to need to prove I\u2019m the smartest person in the room.  Sound familiar?\n\nMy point is that this is a continual source of frustration for my husband, but he sees I\u2019m working hard to fix this issue.  What effort is your GF making to solve this problem of hers?  \n\nHere are a couple of things that my husband did initially to help me with the interrupting.  They may seem harsh, but I was a tough nut to crack.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.  You must have thought I was finished speaking.\u201d  (Accompanied by a direct, hard stare.  He did it privately several times and it didn\u2019t have a huge effect until he did that in front of a close friend and it pulled me up short.  To be clear:  I needed to experience a little bit of embarrassment and the close friend knows I have this issue and that I want to fix it.  It only took that one time for me to get it. I guess I\u2019m like Pavlov\u2019s dog.)\n\n(I interrupt).  He stopped, gave me a direct, hard, unblinking stare until I got uncomfortable enough to stop and say, \u201cWhat?\u201d then said, \u201cI was still speaking.  May I continue now?\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m trained well enough that the quick look is enough to tell me I just did it again and I quickly stop and apologize.  Most of the time, I catch myself before I interrupt. I\u2019m happy to report I\u2019m not doing this nearly as much as I used to.\n\nWhen it comes to the correcting, I think she probably needs some therapy to figure out why she feels the needs to do that.  I hope she invests her time in that, not for you, but for herself.  It\u2019s much harder work.", "ESH.  What she's doing is annoying and you're right to call her out on it.  But your way of handling it is passive-aggressive and ineffective.  Plus it seems like you're setting up a game that will go on forever.  She interrupts, you react, she says you're a jerk for clamming up, rinse and repeat.\n\nIf you really want this to stop, the tit for tat has to stop.  Set boundaries: \"Please don't interrupt me!  I'm just telling a joke!\"  If you're in a situation where you can't do it right then, have a firm, adult conversation about it later.  Don't let yourself be baited into a childish reponse.  And if she really persists, you have to decide whether this is someone you can spend a lot of time with down the road.", "siri show me an unhealthy relationship dynamic", "> \u201cspeed has never killed anyone, it\u2019s the suddenly becoming stationary part that gets you.\u201d\n\n> She said I\u2019m a jerk and being too petty.\n\nI'm really trying to write something clever about the deceleration being what kills you, and [\"jerk\" is the rate of change of acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics\\) ), just as acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, but it's not *quite* coming together.", "ESH.  Interrupting is rude.  I'm guessing she knows that and isn't intentionally doing it or doesn't care.  She may just have bad impulse control.  I think stopping telling it to her just to teach her a lesson or whatever is immature and spiteful.  Continuing like the two of you have been is just going to end up with you both resenting each other.  \n\nI saw in a comment you said she doesn't take medication or anything for ADHD and as far as you know she doesn't have it.  It's definitely under-diagnosed in women, and as someone who also has ADHD that didn't get noticed until adulthood, I'd recommend that she at least look into it.  Worrying about forgetting what she was going to say, the impulsive interruptions, etc, are something that can be really hard to fully control and could be part of the reason she struggles to stop her behavior.", "ESH - she either won\u2019t or can\u2019t honor your reasonable request.

Maybe simply talk strategies to stop this with her. She gets it bothers you and, as your girlfriend, I imagine she doesn\u2019t *want* to bother you.

And tell her exactly what you are telling, a joke or a story, before you tell it. Because if she is interrupting your jokes with facts, she is not picking up on the fact that you are telling a joke.\n\nEdit: I'd also add that if she did have hyperactivity and/or attention deficits, it could be very hard for her to sit and listen to an entire story or long joke in silence until you are finished. I can't diagnose her, but I am still going on the assumption she isn't trying to bother you on purpose.", "Oh my god that would drive me insane.

Weekly?", "If she *is* neurodivergent, he's better off finding a balance with her. And even if she's neurotypical, there is a very obvious communication barrier between them.

Like you it's worse with my partner. In my case I get so anxious about it around others that I become more introverted. I can see how it would feel like she's disrespecting you more than others but it might just be that you're her safe place, someone she trusts, and where she feels like she doesn't feel so on guard. Maybe ask her if she shares this feeling and see about getting her checked out.", "Yeah, I know that interrupting is rude generally, but people have different conversational styles. Some people just keep talking until somebody interrupts and they're fine with this. Some people don't mind it sometimes, and can adjust when they want to finish their thought with like \"hold on\" or \"like I was saying\" etc. Some people don't like interruptions but talk fast and they misread a comma as a period. Some people need very clear indicators that it's their turn to talk. \n\nI think both OP and gf should try to be accommodating, but will likely never match exactly. NAH"]}
