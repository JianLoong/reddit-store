My wife, Emily, has a longtime friend, Leslie, who has recently become a single mother. Leslie does not have a working vehicle at the moment and is working two jobs so Emily took it upon herself to help Leslie out as much as she can. Emily had started asking me to help as well in driving Leslie and her kids around, taking them to school/appointments, taking Leslie to the grocery store, etc, whenever Emily or someone else couldn't.\r  \n\r  \nI agreed since it made my wife happy and I understand the kind of situation Leslie is in. Helping has turned into Emily inviting Leslie and her kids over often, or organizing trips that they would like, such as camping or fishing. A few times my wife was unable to attend these get-togethers she organized due to work and insisted they still take place leaving me to entertain Leslie and her kids on my own. Since I've known of Leslie my entire relationship with my wife I didn't think too much about this. The times that it has been me left with her, or sent in Emily's stead to shuttle Leslie around, I've made normal small talk with her and her kids.\r  \n\r  \nRecently, Leslie's kids were going to be away for a weekend so Emily wanted to have Leslie over for dinner and some movies. She asked me to text Leslie to ask her over and when I did, Leslie replied with \"Just as friends right? I'm not interested in being anyone's girlfriend\". I thought that response was out of left field so I asked her why she'd even say that and her response was pretty much \"No guy would be asking me and my kids how we're doing or helping me out unless he wanted something in return\". I told Leslie it wasn\u2019t anything like that and then showed my wife the conversation and informed her I would be stepping back from helping her with anything involving Leslie and to leave me out of any future plans. I also offered to show her the rest of my phone and anything else. Emily believed me but she still talked to Leslie about it to see what had given her that impression and accordingly, she gave Emily the same answer. A few days later Leslie apologized to Emily and told her that her emotions and mind were just all over because of a down day. That\u2019s fine but I\u2019m still not willing to help her or my wife out anymore as I had been because I don\u2019t want any repeats or accusations hurled at me when I was helping as my wife asked. Emily thinks I\u2019m overreacting and should just brush it off because it was just a \u2018silly miscommunication\u2019 she had on a bad day.

Cringe friend. Could have gone a lot worse. Do not help her unless your wife is around.", "NTA\nShe's ruined a good thing for herself that your kindness was offering.", "NTA. It\u2019s not worth it. I get having a down day, but you don\u2019t take it out on others\u2026 especially ones working hard to help you. It\u2019s not worth your mental health or reputation to keep trying with her", "NTA. Her response was out of line. And the excuse of having a bad day doesn't excuse it.", "NTA  I notice she didn't apologized to you.  She accused you of trying to cheat on your wife, that is no small thing to overlook.", "NTA and your wife is putting your marriage at risk by continuing to \u2018entertain\u2019 and \u2018assist\u2019 her friend while not realizing that #1, she doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s appreciative and #2, she might actually be mental and putting you in the line of fire by asking you to fill in to \u2018entertain\u2019 should never happen. She\u2019s your wife\u2019s friend, not yours. \n\nHer texts to you were definitely out of left field but thank goodness for her battyness because had she said those things to you, your wife definitely wouldn\u2019t have believed you. The texts however, paint a much clearer picture of her issues and your wife shouldn\u2019t be so quick to dismiss your concerns. \n\nYour wife needs reevaluate her friendship and set up firm boundaries for all parties involved because not doing so won\u2019t end well.", "NTA. I think you were right in stepping back. Leslie and her kids are not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nTo be fair, your wife shouldn't have put you in those positions to begin with. Her friend saying what she did makes me concerned that *she* was developing feelings for *you,* which would be completely understandable as she's in a vulnerable place and you were stepping up to help her.\n\nIf it was me, I'd steer clear and let them do their own thing.", "NTA. I would never again be alone with leslie.", "NTA.\nYou were giving too much before, even as a means of being supportive of your wife.\n\nIf your wife wants to take on her friend and her children, as if they are lost puppies, let her. But I wouldn\u2019t be engaging in that ish anymore.", "NTA this is a recipe for disaster. You have no idea when Leslie will get this idea in her head again. You should stay as far away as her as possible. It's also strange that she thought you might be into her but never talked to your wife about it.", "NTA She clearly is looking for trouble. I wouldn\u2019t risk your relationship over helping someone that ungrateful.", "NTA- sounds like Leslie is trying to cause problems In Your marriage so that your wife ends up single as well.\n\nIt\u2019s probably hard on her to see her friend with a helpful, loving husband such as yourself, while she doesn\u2019t.\n\nBe careful around her Op and I would suggest you tell your wife the same.\n\nVideo cameras or record any interaction With  Leslie so she can\u2019t be claiming anything in the future.", "NTA. Leslie should become person non grata to you. She may start telling your wife lies about you because of any other 'miscommunications'.", "it only takes one accusation to ruin a man\u2019s life. since this isnt ur direct friend, stay away. just in case. NTA. be safe. \u201cjustice\u201d doesnt care what sex u are.", "Nta - that's really not a situation you want to get into and out was weird of her to even suggest it. You're definitely not wrong for stepping back. If your wife wants to keep helping her that's on her but she definitely should not expect you to do it.", "NTA.  I'm betting that the friend is catching some feelings for you, or thinks she is, so I would definitely put up some very solid boundaries.  If your wife wants to keep helping her friend, then whatever, but you would be wise to only be around her when your wife is there and no calling or texting.", "NTA. I would never be alone with her again, kids or not. The fact that you are married to her friend and she still asked that question is off the wall crazy. She didn't even say, *because it would be wrong, you're married to my friend*. No she says she isn't looking for a boyfriend. So if you *had* been interested and she was looking...   \n\n\nIt takes one false accusation to ruin a life. Be firm, be polite, but do not give in.", "NTA but why is your wife so suddenly attached to this woman? If I were Leslie, I'd be wondering more if your wife wants a girlfriend than you.", "Info - did she apologise to you once the situation was explained to her?", "NTA.\n\nJust make sure to ***never*** be with her (even if her kids are with her) unless your wife is there.\n\nIt's one thing to be taken advantage of and used as an errand boy, but quite another to be subjected to this nuttery", "NTA.\n\nand make sure that you are **NEVER** alone with leslie and / or her kids.", "NTA but tell Emily that you will no longer be doing anything for Leslie or her kids. And if she organizes things and she can't make it. That you are not stepping up to fill in. \nLeslie is not your responsibility. \nThe only AH'S here are you wife and Leslie..\n\nAnd they both you a massive appolgy. But it doesn't seem you will get one from either one.", "NTA and that\u2019s not a silly miscommunication. If you hadn\u2019t showed your wife when you did this could have been really bad. Who knows what the friend might have told your wife, or if she\u2019s told anyone else your hitting on her.  Do not put yourself in position to be alone just you and her because she\u2019s got other thoughts about you in her mind.", "NTA your wife shouldn\u2019t have volunteered you to help Leslie out like that and put both of you in those awkward situations.\n\nEDIT: As an example, when it comes to setting up play dates for kids, some moms will only talk to the moms of other kids, not the opposite sex parent for this very reason. The dads are the same way and may tell the mom to contact his wife.", "Info - how long have you and your wife been acting as Leslie's chauffeurs and doing everything for her?  What is Leslie's plan to get her own life back together?", "You can't stay far enough away from that. I would be terrified about what is next. It is not over.", "NTA, she bit the hand that feeds her.", "She clearly has had some poor experiences with men. It's weird because your her friends husband, so it's wild she'd assume you were interested in her - but she also wasn't really accusing you of anything. She asked \"just as friends, right?\". Clarifying the situation and making sure it was not something more. And she wasnt entirely wrong either. Sure, you weren't interested in her but you were helping her because your wife. It was not out of the goodness and kindness of your heart lol.     \n\nIt sounds like you're doing too much for her. Hanging out 1:1 is weird and unnecessary, as that's more than \"helping\". Also, if your wife agrees to help then she shouldn't dump it on you. She should ask if you can or are willing to do something before saying \"husband can drive you\" etc. But I think refusing to help or do any favors for her is too much and making a bigger deal out of it. Not really an AH, but unnecessary", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
