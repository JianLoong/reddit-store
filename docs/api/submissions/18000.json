My wife, Emily, has a longtime friend, Leslie, who has recently become a single mother. Leslie does not have a working vehicle at the moment and is working two jobs so Emily took it upon herself to help Leslie out as much as she can. Emily had started asking me to help as well in driving Leslie and her kids around, taking them to school/appointments, taking Leslie to the grocery store, etc, whenever Emily or someone else couldn't.\r  \n\r  \nI agreed since it made my wife happy and I understand the kind of situation Leslie is in. Helping has turned into Emily inviting Leslie and her kids over often, or organizing trips that they would like, such as camping or fishing. A few times my wife was unable to attend these get-togethers she organized due to work and insisted they still take place leaving me to entertain Leslie and her kids on my own. Since I've known of Leslie my entire relationship with my wife I didn't think too much about this. The times that it has been me left with her, or sent in Emily's stead to shuttle Leslie around, I've made normal small talk with her and her kids.\r  \n\r  \nRecently, Leslie's kids were going to be away for a weekend so Emily wanted to have Leslie over for dinner and some movies. She asked me to text Leslie to ask her over and when I did, Leslie replied with \"Just as friends right? I'm not interested in being anyone's girlfriend\". I thought that response was out of left field so I asked her why she'd even say that and her response was pretty much \"No guy would be asking me and my kids how we're doing or helping me out unless he wanted something in return\". I told Leslie it wasn\u2019t anything like that and then showed my wife the conversation and informed her I would be stepping back from helping her with anything involving Leslie and to leave me out of any future plans. I also offered to show her the rest of my phone and anything else. Emily believed me but she still talked to Leslie about it to see what had given her that impression and accordingly, she gave Emily the same answer. A few days later Leslie apologized to Emily and told her that her emotions and mind were just all over because of a down day. That\u2019s fine but I\u2019m still not willing to help her or my wife out anymore as I had been because I don\u2019t want any repeats or accusations hurled at me when I was helping as my wife asked. Emily thinks I\u2019m overreacting and should just brush it off because it was just a \u2018silly miscommunication\u2019 she had on a bad day.

I'm betting that the friend is catching some feelings for you, or thinks she is, so I would definitely put up some very solid boundaries.

The dads are the same way and may tell the mom to contact his wife.", "Info - how long have you and your wife been acting as Leslie's chauffeurs and doing everything for her?

It's weird because your her friends husband, so it's wild she'd assume you were interested in her - but she also wasn't really accusing you of anything. She asked \"just as friends, right?\". Clarifying the situation and making sure it was not something more. And she wasnt entirely wrong either. Sure, you weren't interested in her but you were helping her because your wife. It was not out of the goodness and kindness of your heart lol.     \n\nIt sounds like you're doing too much for her. Hanging out 1:1 is weird and unnecessary, as that's more than \"helping\". Also, if your wife agrees to help then she shouldn't dump it on you. She should ask if you can or are willing to do something before saying \"husband can drive you\" etc. But I think refusing to help or do any favors for her is too much and making a bigger deal out of it.

Leslie is emotionally vulnerable due to recently becoming single and probably subconsciously either looking for a man or wary of men,  depending on her feelings toward men after her break-up. I can't understand your wife putting you in that number of situations with Leslie where the two of you ended up doing things together without her present. How is your relationship with your wife? I may be crazy, but it almost seems that your wife was trying to set you up to cheat with Leslie. Especially with her not admitting that it was really odd for Leslie to ask you that.\nAnd definitely keep your distance from Leslie and stop all communications between the two of you", "NTA you are right to pull back.

Make sure you keep clear and open communication with your wife, because it feels like Leslie could easily start making things up to try and divide you two. NTA", ">A few days later Leslie apologized to Emily\n\nLeslie should be apologising to you, too, and I really wonder why she hasn't.\n\nYou are absolutely right to remove yourself from this situation. You have put yourself out for Leslie and she should be thanking you instead of accusing you of being a creep based on absolutely nothing.\n\n*EDIT*\n\n>Emily thinks I\u2019m overreacting and should just brush it off because it was just a \u2018silly miscommunication\u2019 \n\nThere is nothing 'silly' about this and neither is it a 'miscommunication'. Bad day or not, Leslie's allegation against you was very clear; it was an attack on your character which could have resulted in problems in your marriage. I have a feeling your wife is minimising this situation and telling you to get over it because she doesn't want to lose you as a chauffeur when she's too busy to honour her promises to Leslie. I hope I'm wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I think your wife is creating the problem here. She is asking you to help Leslie in a way that seems disproportional to your friendship with her. It is creating a weird situation for all parties.  Leslie could have communicated her worries better but she clearly feels uncomfortable to an extend and it is time to step back. This does not sound sustainable long term anyway.", "NTA. stay clear of her. Honestly I\u2019m trying to figure out what your wife is thinking? If I want my girlfriend over, I\u2019m not going to have my husband text her.", "NTA\n\nLeslie apologized to your wife, but not to you. I know I wouldn't feel comfortable helping out someone who accused me of having ulterior motives AND couldn't be bothered to say sorry.", "NTA\n\nBut only because Leslie didn't apologize. And I don't think you're in the wrong for not helping her anymore.\n\nThis is kind of a weird situation. Like if my friend asks me to go fishing with me and my kids, then sends her boyfriend/fiance/husband in her place, that's pretty weird. If it was just an errand that's one thing, but a whole ass fun trip is super weird. I would just cancel the plans at that point. Also, was this fishing and camping trip just you, Leslie and her kids, or were there others involved?\n\nSo I can actually kind of get Leslie's side, because this time, you directly texted her from your phone right? When your wife sets up these errands/play dates, I'm guessing she initially says it'll be her, then shit might come up and so maybe half the time, she then tells Leslie that you're coming.\n\nSo a direct text to Leslie from you asking to come over for movies kinda does feel pretty off.\n\nAlso, you say paraphrase here: \"No guy would be asking me and my kids how we're doing or helping me out unless he wanted something in return\", but I'm curious what exactly the text messages say.", "That is such a weird response. Your wife has been helping out. There obviously had to be some communication between your wife and the friend. \"Oh, I can't do this for you today but my husband can help.\" So why would the friend assume that you wanted something from her? Clearly you are doing this because your wife asked you.\n\nI would step back too. This isn't a miscommunication. This is an accusation\n\n\nNTA", "No good deed goes unpunished. NTA.", "NTA - if my husband was helping one of my friends and her kids because he is genuinely a good person, and she said something like that, I would terminate the friendship. \n\nPeople shouldn't automatically assume that they want something when someone is helping them, and furthermore it is disrespectful to you and your wife. It's almost like she was trying to get you in trouble. \n\nI wouldn't help her, and really your wife should stop helping her too. This lady is seriously taking advantage on you guys.", "NTA. This is how peoples\u2019 lives get ruined.", "NTA, but I don't get why all the comments seem convinced Leslie is either trying to seduce you or destroy your marriage. I suspect she's been burned before by men who use \"friendly\" gestures to try to hit on her, and her clumsy attempt to set boundaries backfired hard. \n\nThere's no value in speculating wildly on why she thought you may have been flirting - only she could possibly know, and even then there's no guarantee she'll be truthful (with you or with herself). \n\nLeslie definitely owes you an apology, and I'd say your wife does too. Your kindness was misconstrued and taken for granted, and that shouldn't be swept under the rug.", "NAH- Going against the grain here and saying Leslie clarifying the situation is reasonable. If anything- this is on OP\u2019s wife for blurring boundaries. Wife should not be asking husband to be social without wife there (driving is one thing but whole social events is different.)", "NTA. Leslie fucking sucks, you did nothing wrong. This is your wife's mess to clean up.", "NTA she doesn't even need to be in your home. Your wife wants to help cool she can do it on her own time.", "NTA. Down day, projection, whatever was happening you need have no part of it", "NTA. I don't think it was wrong of her to ask to clarify, *once*.

She's accusing you with a very serious thing, I'm glad you read right through it because it's not a silly miscommunication. You're her friend's husband on top of all, even if she had a doubt in her mind like that, she should have apologized right away to you as well. You are the one being accused like that when you were trying to help, someone who truly appreciates the effort you've put would have apologized to your face.", "NTA i would also take a complete step back over that kind of comment. with that comment, leslie made it very clear how she views your kindness toward and her children: as nothing but an attempt to get her into bed. why continue to go out of your way for someone who just thinks you\u2019re trying to cheat on your wife with them? i think your wife is underreacting and being dismissive of your feelings here.", "NTA and Leslie is now holding a big red flag. She is trying to interfere with your relationship with your wife and turn Emily into second parent. \n\nYou both need to step back and let Leslie figure out being in her new situation without Emily becoming her \"husband\".", "NTA- Avoid Leslie at all costs. She has shown you her potential for dramatic messiness.", "NTA, How do one have so many examples and so much history of you guys helping her out of the kindness of your hearts and not demanding anything, and all of the sudden it\u2019s \u201coh you must want something more\u201d. It is very out of left field and very weird for to go there. The only thought I have is that she was trying to hit on you? But it backfired, and so she\u2019s playing dumb. That would sort of explain why she only apologized to your gf and is still avoiding you. It\u2019s either that, or she\u2019s actually that dumb.", "NTA for the situation.

It\u2019s not her place to do so.", "NTA You are NOT over reacting Stand your ground", "Why does everyone think this girl was  looking for trouble? She was setting boundaries which is what I would have been doing as well. I would have thought it totally bizarre that my girlfriend's husband was just showing up on his own to do stuff with me. I think the wife has gone completely overboard and put the husband and friend in an awkward situation. She is probably relieved he stopped showing up. There is being supportive and then there is getting way too freaking involved. As the husband I would have refused to be volunteered to do all that stuff.", "NTA, but this is a LOT to do for someone that isn\u2019t family. Are you sure your wife isn\u2019t having a little bit of an affair (at least emotionally)?", "Your wife is doing no one any favors here and is, in fact, putting way more stress on your marriage than there needs to be. I would definitely step back completely and remind the wife that her friend accused him of cheating. As a married man, that would put me on high alert and never trust being around this woman for fear of what she might assume. Tell the wife tough luck, you can't take the risk, and you now do not trust her friend and leave you completely out of it from now on.", "NTA\n\nYou no longer trust Leslie\u2019s ability to interpret actions, and you don\u2019t want to be around to see what else she will misinterpret.", "Poor guy. Even his wife is an absolute spineless clown.", "NTA, protect yourself, that is a strange place for her to jump right to after you all have basically been raising her and her kids.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, but marriages as well as individual men\u2019s lives are ruined by this type of accusation all the time. I get that she\u2019s in a bad place, but this is a very serious subject. No need to become hostile, but I would also massively reduce if not eliminate interaction with someone who accused me like that. Accusations of cheating are definitely not simple miscommunications\u2026", "NTA. Nope the F out. It\u2019s done. Burn before reading. I would not be alone in the same room and i would not communicate further. I would not even be comfortable with her coming over.", "She jeopardized your marriage. NTA and I would stay away too. Frankly, if I was your wife I\u2019d also be concerned by the accusation. Why would you want to be around someone who speaks ill of your spouse?", "Of course now it looks like you aren\u2019t helping because she \u201crejected\u201d you. \n\nBut who cares, NTA. Even she thinks it was an over-reach of your friendship to help so much.

Stay away!", "NTA you're overreacting?!? That's rich coming from her...", "NTA, but as I read your post I began to think your wife is straight up nuts.  Asking you to do all that really blurs lines.  I also don't blame you for never ever ever being alone with Leslie or helping her again in any way.", "NTA you are 100% right stepping back. This is not a miscommunication. She\u2019s trouble.", "NTA. Wife should have made the plans anyway, Leslie owes you an apology, not your wife. You don't need this stress. Be polite, leave them all to their own devices.", "NTA\n\nMy feelings would be so hurt and I would never be alone with her ever again. \n\nWe\u2019ve all had bad days and I bet almost zero of us have ever accused a good friend\u2019s husband, who is helping, of wanting to get in our pants. She\u2019s letting her divorce poison her mind about men in general.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Any communication should be via group text including your wife. I don\u2019t understand why your wife wouldn\u2019t invite her and had you do it, unless your wife was testing her friend. \n\nBut I would not feel comfortable doing anything without the wife present (kids present or not).", "NTA. This was not a \"silly miscommunication\". This was not a miscommunucation at all. She clearly communicated to what she thought was going on.\n\nThis was her misinterpreting what was going on.\n\nAnd ok, so the misinterpretation may have been because she was having a bad day (and a bad year). But that's as may be, it's still a frog. Regardless of why she misinterpreted things, she did.\n\nAnd now that it has been said, it can't be taken back. She had that impression once. You cannot trust that the impression might not re-surface.\n\nStepping back from interacting with her is the course of prudence. Most definitely starting with pulling back from entertaining her and her kids when your wife is not around. You can still be cordial when all of you are together, but your wife needs to be the entertainment commitee. And yes, leave you out of plans altogether.\n\nIt is perhaps unfortunant that this also means that you won't be able to assist with driving her, but it is what it is. Stepping back here means stepping back all the way.\n\nWill this potentially damage the relationship between your wife and Leslie? Yes, it might. But not stepping back presents equal or greater risks to your marriage.\n\nGiven the choice between the two possibilities, choosing to protect your marriage is the right choice.", "NTA. Your wife needs to take a solid 6 month break from Leslie and her kids, too. \n\nYikes", "NTA.\n\nSorry but you need to sit down with your wife and make it clear you are no longer helping because the very clear jump to accusations has made you very uncomfortable and you don't want to be put into a situation where this can repeat again.\n\nIf she keeps pushing then you may want to think about couples counseling.\n\nLeslie ruined a good thing because she can't fathom that her friend's husband is genuinely nice instead of wanting to get with her. I've had bad days, currently having one now, and not once have I jumped the gun like this. Leslie needs to get herself into therapy.\n\nYou and your wife should both be taking a step back from helping this much, especially after Leslie's comment about \"just as friends right?\". That was cute or a mistake made when feeling down, that was deliberate.", "Big Yikes. Nope, your relationship with this person when your wife isn't present is over.

Wife was dumping the help she was offering on OP, when it should have been her doing it. He did not and doesn't need to help at all. I even siad I don't think he's an AH for not helping. But I can somewhat understand her need to clarify that going to the movies 1:1 with her friends husband was not expected to be a date. Is it shitty she had to question his motives? Absolutely. Does OP have a right to feel upset that his motives were questioned? Absolutely. It's sad this woman has never had a male relationship or someone do something nice for her where they weren't actually interested. Her idea that guys don't do anything or care to check in without expecting something is really unfortunate as it's clearly not true. But that has been her experience and its something I can understand, too. It says less about him and more about her and her unfortunate experiences with men. \n\nOP is not, and never has been under any obligation to help her. This woman has only experienced men in her life who are interested in something. I have had similiar experiences where I had male friends and the friendship ends once they go for it and I told them it's just a friendship. I even had a couple of my current finances friends, and a friend's boyfriend in the past make moves which I was not expecting. So I can understand wanting to clarify what is going on.       \n\nIt is not OPs responsibility to change her outlook on men, but by actually continuing to help her occasionally, or not making it into a big thing, it might actually change her outlook on men. I think he was already helping too much and it should be more on the wife to begin with as I don't agree with offering help and dumping it on someone else, but stopping entirely just for this particular reason  seems unnecessary. I can see myself being understanding in any of these peoples situations. \n\nI think OP fearing accusations is unwarrented.

But acting as if a friend has some nefarious agenda is AH behavior", "She very much accused.\n\nBy saying she wasn\u2019t interested in being anyone\u2019s girlfriend, she was very much accusing OP of romantic/sexual desires where non existed. It\u2019s disgusting to think just because OP was friendly and nice enough to do as his wife requested to help her out that he had any other intentions. The very act of thinking op was anything other than friendly is misogynistic. \n\nIf a man thought a woman wanted sex/romance simply because she was nice and friendly towards him, he would be disgusting. How is this any different?", "Ohhhh no. That was 100% accusal. \n\nAnd did you really just compare complex human dynamics and relationships to...fear of dogs?", "Sorry it just seems like a situation where a woman says so clearly that she doesn't want a man and people instead twist that into \"well she's playing hard to get\" \"she's testing the waters\" \"she wants him to know she's available.\" \n\nRather than just hearing her words and believing them. \n\nIt sounds like she just said him showing up in place of her friend makes her uncomfortable and somehow you turned that into her wanting to be with him.", "This! 100%", "I feel like OP and the friend need to have a sit down talk with the wife together. It's clear she has overestimated their friendship when really the only thing they have in common is her. They need to set a boundary with her.\n\nPersonally, I would be weirded out if my friend set up a movie night or event with my kids and then instead of canceling when she couldn't make it, she just left me alone with her husband. I'd feel even weirder when she did it multiple times.", "But if she was into him and he was doing these favors... wouldn't she just come on to him too? \n\nInstead of laying a hard boundary that things wouldn't get romantic. \n\nI agree that misread his intentions but it does not sound like she wants him at all. If anything it sounds like she's uncomfortable with this attention.", "Seriously, who throws their spouse at another person (single at that) then acts like her text to him was nothing? That's not logical.", "He has a right to distance himself, but he should be aware of how she will perceive it. \n\nAfter all if he wasn\u2019t interested, then it should not have been a problem to reassure her that he was only doing as his wife asked and that everything was above board.", "Thank you!!", "Haha brilliant!! Mines not until next year now so I was wondering what the fuss was about", "I don't find the website idiotic, I find the whole idea of celebrating the anniversary of the creation of one's account on it idiotic. Not the same thing", ">You cannot blame anything bad a certain woman does to a man on misogyny.\n\nWhy not? Women can be perpetrators of misogyny too.", "Right. Not all men.", "Not even a little bit.", "If a whole bunch of women have made up accusations about you, sure. \n\nSince being a single mom, you\u2019d be shocked the number of men that circle like sharks in the early days thinking because you\u2019re \u2018desperate\u2019 that they can exploit you. Even \u2018good\u2019 ones. I lost a lot of friends because of it. Probably didn\u2019t help that I was young so more vulnerable. I don\u2019t have an issue with someone saying \u2018I\u2019ve had this problem before, it won\u2019t be a problem with us, will it?\u2019 In any situation.", ">Recently, Leslie's kids were going to be away for a weekend so Emily wanted to have Leslie over for dinner and some movies.\n\nHonestly, if I asked a guy out for dinner and a movie, I wouldn't be at all offended if he wanted to clarify that it was just as friends. I've had more dates that consisted of dinner and movies than I can count. I don't blame her for asking for clarification. So much language around dating and romantic interest is vague. \"Wanna get dinner?\" or \"Wanna see a movie?\" *is* often an invitation to a date. If it's ambiguous, ask. To me, at least, that's how you avoid miscommunications. \n\nAnd.... Having been made a single parent by a shitty ex husband.... The number of men who are skeevy about single/divorced moms in some way is both surprising and appalling. There's the \"you're used goods, you're just someone else's thrown away trash, being with you would be like using someone else's worn out old toothbrush\" types, and there's the \"if I get in good with mom by showing what a great helper I am when it comes to her kids, then I'll get into her bed\" types. And there's tons in both groups who look to take advantage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm putting this in its own paragraph just so it stands out -- I am aware not all men are like this. I know that the majority specifically *are* *not* like this and are good, honest, decent people. OP is clearly one of the good ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I don't necessarily agree with OP's stance, I do understand where he's coming from and am extremely reluctant to label him the A. Nor would I necessarily label anyone else the A. NAH, I guess? \n\nHonestly, a good sit-down between all three of them together would really be best -- a chance to air out the whole thing together so that they're all on the same page and can move forward as friends.", "You DO know that happens a lot, right? And when I witness it, I ask them what happened. Because they're clearly not okay, and it was often because of something someone else did to them. I listen to what happened, and see if I can find any red flags that they missed at the time so they can decrease their chances of it happening again. Or i tell them \"okay, when you did this, that probably made her uncomfortable and here's why,\" again, so they can avoid similar situations in the future.", "Yes. Because it's an accurate metaphor.", "Fear generally. Not all dogs will rape you, not all men will try to sexually exploit you. But some will.\n\n\u2018As friends, right?\u2019 Is different to \u2018you want to have sex with me, you\u2019re awful!\u2019", "And in an alternate universe where the husband *is* hitting on her, if she hadn't drawn a boundary, these same people crying false accusations would say \"Well, why didn't she make it clear sooner that she wasn't interested?\"\n\nThe only reason OP knows the first boundary was unreasonable is that OP lives in OP's head. \n\nWhy did Emily want OP to text her on that occasion, instead of Emily herself doing it?", "I get your perspective. It's mainly because this seemed to come out of nowhere.", "Agree! This definitely needs to be discussed between all three. If I were any one of them I'd feel uncomfortable about all the alone time between OP and friend and would want to put a stop to it.", "Because she thought she was girlfriend material and was being treated as such.", "Are you a woman? Because if youre not youre really missing how direct we can be. If a woman is starting to feel something she is going to say what she said flat out to both shut it down and simultaneously test the waters. Shes not being victimized here, a normal person would understand that they are JUST helping her out.", "I understand your point but this whole issue came from her wrongly perceiving things so I just think he shouldn\u2019t really care and the onus is not on him to apologize or correct things when she is the one who made him uncomfortable and overstepped.", "I finally figured it out on my last birthday (Nov) when there was no \"Happy Cake Day.\" \ud83d\ude02", "Ohhhhhh, I see! \ud83d\ude02", "I believe the term for this is \"victim blaming\"", "You can say it, I can fire the friendship into the sun though.", "That makes sense to me, and maybe I was too definitive.\n\nI wonder if there\u2019s a distinction between AH behavior and behavior that is technically value neutral, but will absolutely damage interpersonal relationships. Like OP should never be alone with this woman again for his own sake, and she has nuked any friendship they had, but she may have been just trying to protect herself. \n\nI think it\u2019d veer into AH behavior if this person expected OP to go back to helping her out afterwards, because sometimes you cannot unring a bell, but there\u2019s no indication in the post that\u2019s actually the case here", "Did it though? \n\nShe keeps making plans with her friend only to be left alone with her husband who's she's not that close to. \n\nA lot of people on the outside (like people in this subreddit) would start whispering that she must be angling to steal him away. So instead she made her boundaries clear.", "Unless they believed that before just to have a man say she's a villain who led him on by accepting his help with her kids. \n\nWhich is a super common thing that happens with single moms. Including my own mom. \n\nAnd by the way, yes I am a woman.", "Honestly, It\u2019s kinda on ops wife. If I kept making plans to hang out with a friend and then got bait and switch into 1:1 time with their husband after my friend couldn\u2019t make it, it would raise all kinds if red flags.", "I hope everyone here who's saying \"She's gonna accuse you of SA!\" will do the following:\n\nEvery time there's a thread where the OP's girlfriend has a male friend who helps her out a lot, and the usual incels pop up to say he's \"orbiting\" and wants in her pants, I expect the people on this thread to jump in and say nah, he's just being a friend. And every time these incels say the girlfriend must sekritly want him or else she'd give him a firm preemptive rejection, I expect the people on this thread to defend her too, because clearly saying nothing is the way to go.", "Yeah, honestly this makes me feel weird about OP's wife. It feels like she's trying to set them up almost.", "Yeahhhh no. These comments keep going from one extreme to another lmao"]}
