{"id": 18000, "submission_id": "13pucfh", "title": "AITA for refusing to help my wife and her friend anymore over what my wife calls a miscommunication?", "selftext": "Fake names. My wife, Emily, has a longtime friend, Leslie, who has recently become a single mother. Leslie does not have a working vehicle at the moment and is working two jobs so Emily took it upon herself to help Leslie out as much as she can. Emily had started asking me to help as well in driving Leslie and her kids around, taking them to school/appointments, taking Leslie to the grocery store, etc, whenever Emily or someone else couldn't.\n\nI agreed since it made my wife happy and I understand the kind of situation Leslie is in. Helping has turned into Emily inviting Leslie and her kids over often, or organizing trips that they would like, such as camping or fishing. A few times my wife was unable to attend these get-togethers she organized due to work and insisted they still take place leaving me to entertain Leslie and her kids on my own. Since I've known of Leslie my entire relationship with my wife I didn't think too much about this. The times that it has been me left with her, or sent in Emily's stead to shuttle Leslie around, I've made normal small talk with her and her kids.\n\nRecently, Leslie's kids were going to be away for a weekend so Emily wanted to have Leslie over for dinner and some movies. She asked me to text Leslie to ask her over and when I did, Leslie replied with \"Just as friends right? I'm not interested in being anyone's girlfriend\". I thought that response was out of left field so I asked her why she'd even say that and her response was pretty much \"No guy would be asking me and my kids how we're doing or helping me out unless he wanted something in return\". I told Leslie it wasn\u2019t anything like that and then showed my wife the conversation and informed her I would be stepping back from helping her with anything involving Leslie and to leave me out of any future plans. I also offered to show her the rest of my phone and anything else. Emily believed me but she still talked to Leslie about it to see what had given her that impression and accordingly, she gave Emily the same answer. A few days later Leslie apologized to Emily and told her that her emotions and mind were just all over because of a down day. That\u2019s fine but I\u2019m still not willing to help her or my wife out anymore as I had been because I don\u2019t want any repeats or accusations hurled at me when I was helping as my wife asked. Emily thinks I\u2019m overreacting and should just brush it off because it was just a \u2018silly miscommunication\u2019 she had on a bad day. AITA?\n\nAdditional info: The text I sent Leslie about the night was \"Emily wants to know if you'd like to come over for dinner and some movies on Saturday\". That's why her response was so out of left field. I sent the text because Emily was busy on her phone and wanted to know asap so we could make our weekend plans.", "created_utc": 1684861435, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pucfh/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_wife_and_her_friend/", "score": 5440, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm betting that the friend is catching some feelings for you, or thinks she is, so I would definitely put up some very solid boundaries.

The dads are the same way and may tell the mom to contact his wife.", "Info - how long have you and your wife been acting as Leslie's chauffeurs and doing everything for her?  What is Leslie's plan to get her own life back together?", "You can't stay far enough away from that. I would be terrified about what is next. It is not over.", "NTA, she bit the hand that feeds her.", "She clearly has had some poor experiences with men. It's weird because your her friends husband, so it's wild she'd assume you were interested in her - but she also wasn't really accusing you of anything. She asked \"just as friends, right?\". Clarifying the situation and making sure it was not something more. And she wasnt entirely wrong either. Sure, you weren't interested in her but you were helping her because your wife. It was not out of the goodness and kindness of your heart lol.     \n\nIt sounds like you're doing too much for her. Hanging out 1:1 is weird and unnecessary, as that's more than \"helping\". Also, if your wife agrees to help then she shouldn't dump it on you. She should ask if you can or are willing to do something before saying \"husband can drive you\" etc. But I think refusing to help or do any favors for her is too much and making a bigger deal out of it. Not really an AH, but unnecessary", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Leslie is emotionally vulnerable due to recently becoming single and probably subconsciously either looking for a man or wary of men,  depending on her feelings toward men after her break-up. I can't understand your wife putting you in that number of situations with Leslie where the two of you ended up doing things together without her present. How is your relationship with your wife? I may be crazy, but it almost seems that your wife was trying to set you up to cheat with Leslie. Especially with her not admitting that it was really odd for Leslie to ask you that.\nAnd definitely keep your distance from Leslie and stop all communications between the two of you", "NTA you are right to pull back. However, you can offer to watch her kids if needed to keep your wife happy", "Buffalo Bills former punter is living through that right now.", "They've always been attached at the hip. When my wife had surgery for carpal tunnel Leslie kept showing up even when I was home to take care of Emily and the house.

A lot of times, it's for the best.", "It's been about 4 months. Leslie is trying to save up to get a new used car or her current one fixed as well as looking for a cheaper place to live.", "She\u2019s definitely in to you.  You made the right decision.  Make sure you keep clear and open communication with your wife, because it feels like Leslie could easily start making things up to try and divide you two. NTA", ">A few days later Leslie apologized to Emily\n\nLeslie should be apologising to you, too, and I really wonder why she hasn't.\n\nYou are absolutely right to remove yourself from this situation. You have put yourself out for Leslie and she should be thanking you instead of accusing you of being a creep based on absolutely nothing.\n\n*EDIT*\n\n>Emily thinks I\u2019m overreacting and should just brush it off because it was just a \u2018silly miscommunication\u2019 \n\nThere is nothing 'silly' about this and neither is it a 'miscommunication'. Bad day or not, Leslie's allegation against you was very clear; it was an attack on your character which could have resulted in problems in your marriage. I have a feeling your wife is minimising this situation and telling you to get over it because she doesn't want to lose you as a chauffeur when she's too busy to honour her promises to Leslie. I hope I'm wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I think your wife is creating the problem here. She is asking you to help Leslie in a way that seems disproportional to your friendship with her. It is creating a weird situation for all parties.  Leslie could have communicated her worries better but she clearly feels uncomfortable to an extend and it is time to step back. This does not sound sustainable long term anyway.", "NTA. stay clear of her. Honestly I\u2019m trying to figure out what your wife is thinking? If I want my girlfriend over, I\u2019m not going to have my husband text her.", "NTA\n\nLeslie apologized to your wife, but not to you. I know I wouldn't feel comfortable helping out someone who accused me of having ulterior motives AND couldn't be bothered to say sorry.", "NTA\n\nBut only because Leslie didn't apologize. And I don't think you're in the wrong for not helping her anymore.\n\nThis is kind of a weird situation. Like if my friend asks me to go fishing with me and my kids, then sends her boyfriend/fiance/husband in her place, that's pretty weird. If it was just an errand that's one thing, but a whole ass fun trip is super weird. I would just cancel the plans at that point. Also, was this fishing and camping trip just you, Leslie and her kids, or were there others involved?\n\nSo I can actually kind of get Leslie's side, because this time, you directly texted her from your phone right? When your wife sets up these errands/play dates, I'm guessing she initially says it'll be her, then shit might come up and so maybe half the time, she then tells Leslie that you're coming.\n\nSo a direct text to Leslie from you asking to come over for movies kinda does feel pretty off.\n\nAlso, you say paraphrase here: \"No guy would be asking me and my kids how we're doing or helping me out unless he wanted something in return\", but I'm curious what exactly the text messages say.", "That is such a weird response. Your wife has been helping out. There obviously had to be some communication between your wife and the friend. \"Oh, I can't do this for you today but my husband can help.\" So why would the friend assume that you wanted something from her? Clearly you are doing this because your wife asked you.\n\nI would step back too. This isn't a miscommunication. This is an accusation\n\n\nNTA", "No good deed goes unpunished. NTA.", "NTA - if my husband was helping one of my friends and her kids because he is genuinely a good person, and she said something like that, I would terminate the friendship. \n\nPeople shouldn't automatically assume that they want something when someone is helping them, and furthermore it is disrespectful to you and your wife. It's almost like she was trying to get you in trouble. \n\nI wouldn't help her, and really your wife should stop helping her too. This lady is seriously taking advantage on you guys.", "NTA. This is how peoples\u2019 lives get ruined.", "NTA, but I don't get why all the comments seem convinced Leslie is either trying to seduce you or destroy your marriage. I suspect she's been burned before by men who use \"friendly\" gestures to try to hit on her, and her clumsy attempt to set boundaries backfired hard. \n\nThere's no value in speculating wildly on why she thought you may have been flirting - only she could possibly know, and even then there's no guarantee she'll be truthful (with you or with herself). \n\nLeslie definitely owes you an apology, and I'd say your wife does too. Your kindness was misconstrued and taken for granted, and that shouldn't be swept under the rug.", "NAH- Going against the grain here and saying Leslie clarifying the situation is reasonable. If anything- this is on OP\u2019s wife for blurring boundaries. Wife should not be asking husband to be social without wife there (driving is one thing but whole social events is different.)", "NTA. Leslie fucking sucks, you did nothing wrong. This is your wife's mess to clean up.", "NTA she doesn't even need to be in your home. Your wife wants to help cool she can do it on her own time.", "NTA. Down day, projection, whatever was happening you need have no part of it", "NTA. I don't think it was wrong of her to ask to clarify, *once*. But once you asked her why she thought that, she should have come back with something like \"I just wanted to clear the air just in case,\" and then she should have apologized to you and not just to Emily.", "NTA. She's accusing you with a very serious thing, I'm glad you read right through it because it's not a silly miscommunication. You're her friend's husband on top of all, even if she had a doubt in her mind like that, she should have apologized right away to you as well. You are the one being accused like that when you were trying to help, someone who truly appreciates the effort you've put would have apologized to your face.", "NTA i would also take a complete step back over that kind of comment. with that comment, leslie made it very clear how she views your kindness toward and her children: as nothing but an attempt to get her into bed. why continue to go out of your way for someone who just thinks you\u2019re trying to cheat on your wife with them? i think your wife is underreacting and being dismissive of your feelings here.", "NTA and Leslie is now holding a big red flag. She is trying to interfere with your relationship with your wife and turn Emily into second parent. \n\nYou both need to step back and let Leslie figure out being in her new situation without Emily becoming her \"husband\".", "NTA- Avoid Leslie at all costs. She has shown you her potential for dramatic messiness.", "NTA, How do one have so many examples and so much history of you guys helping her out of the kindness of your hearts and not demanding anything, and all of the sudden it\u2019s \u201coh you must want something more\u201d. It is very out of left field and very weird for to go there. The only thought I have is that she was trying to hit on you? But it backfired, and so she\u2019s playing dumb. That would sort of explain why she only apologized to your gf and is still avoiding you. It\u2019s either that, or she\u2019s actually that dumb.", "NTA for the situation. I think your wife is an asshole for volunteering you in helping someone else out. It\u2019s not her place to do so.", "NTA You are NOT over reacting Stand your ground", "Why does everyone think this girl was  looking for trouble? She was setting boundaries which is what I would have been doing as well. I would have thought it totally bizarre that my girlfriend's husband was just showing up on his own to do stuff with me. I think the wife has gone completely overboard and put the husband and friend in an awkward situation. She is probably relieved he stopped showing up. There is being supportive and then there is getting way too freaking involved. As the husband I would have refused to be volunteered to do all that stuff.", "NTA, but this is a LOT to do for someone that isn\u2019t family. Are you sure your wife isn\u2019t having a little bit of an affair (at least emotionally)?", "Your wife is doing no one any favors here and is, in fact, putting way more stress on your marriage than there needs to be. I would definitely step back completely and remind the wife that her friend accused him of cheating. As a married man, that would put me on high alert and never trust being around this woman for fear of what she might assume. Tell the wife tough luck, you can't take the risk, and you now do not trust her friend and leave you completely out of it from now on.", "NTA\n\nYou no longer trust Leslie\u2019s ability to interpret actions, and you don\u2019t want to be around to see what else she will misinterpret.", "Poor guy. Even his wife is an absolute spineless clown.", "NTA, protect yourself, that is a strange place for her to jump right to after you all have basically been raising her and her kids.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, but marriages as well as individual men\u2019s lives are ruined by this type of accusation all the time. I get that she\u2019s in a bad place, but this is a very serious subject. No need to become hostile, but I would also massively reduce if not eliminate interaction with someone who accused me like that. Accusations of cheating are definitely not simple miscommunications\u2026", "NTA. Nope the F out. It\u2019s done. Burn before reading. I would not be alone in the same room and i would not communicate further. I would not even be comfortable with her coming over.", "She jeopardized your marriage. NTA and I would stay away too. Frankly, if I was your wife I\u2019d also be concerned by the accusation. Why would you want to be around someone who speaks ill of your spouse?", "Of course now it looks like you aren\u2019t helping because she \u201crejected\u201d you. \n\nBut who cares, NTA. Even she thinks it was an over-reach of your friendship to help so much. She didn\u2019t think you would unless you had other ideas.", "I'd say Leslie is testing the waters to see if a bit of fun with her friend's husband is actually a possibility! NTA. Stay away!", "NTA you're overreacting?!? That's rich coming from her...", "NTA, but as I read your post I began to think your wife is straight up nuts.  Asking you to do all that really blurs lines.  I also don't blame you for never ever ever being alone with Leslie or helping her again in any way.", "NTA you are 100% right stepping back. This is not a miscommunication. She\u2019s trouble.", "NTA. Wife should have made the plans anyway, Leslie owes you an apology, not your wife. You don't need this stress. Be polite, leave them all to their own devices.", "NTA\n\nMy feelings would be so hurt and I would never be alone with her ever again. \n\nWe\u2019ve all had bad days and I bet almost zero of us have ever accused a good friend\u2019s husband, who is helping, of wanting to get in our pants. She\u2019s letting her divorce poison her mind about men in general.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Any communication should be via group text including your wife. I don\u2019t understand why your wife wouldn\u2019t invite her and had you do it, unless your wife was testing her friend. \n\nBut I would not feel comfortable doing anything without the wife present (kids present or not).", "NTA. This was not a \"silly miscommunication\". This was not a miscommunucation at all. She clearly communicated to what she thought was going on.\n\nThis was her misinterpreting what was going on.\n\nAnd ok, so the misinterpretation may have been because she was having a bad day (and a bad year). But that's as may be, it's still a frog. Regardless of why she misinterpreted things, she did.\n\nAnd now that it has been said, it can't be taken back. She had that impression once. You cannot trust that the impression might not re-surface.\n\nStepping back from interacting with her is the course of prudence. Most definitely starting with pulling back from entertaining her and her kids when your wife is not around. You can still be cordial when all of you are together, but your wife needs to be the entertainment commitee. And yes, leave you out of plans altogether.\n\nIt is perhaps unfortunant that this also means that you won't be able to assist with driving her, but it is what it is. Stepping back here means stepping back all the way.\n\nWill this potentially damage the relationship between your wife and Leslie? Yes, it might. But not stepping back presents equal or greater risks to your marriage.\n\nGiven the choice between the two possibilities, choosing to protect your marriage is the right choice.", "NTA. Your wife needs to take a solid 6 month break from Leslie and her kids, too. \n\nYikes", "NTA.\n\nSorry but you need to sit down with your wife and make it clear you are no longer helping because the very clear jump to accusations has made you very uncomfortable and you don't want to be put into a situation where this can repeat again.\n\nIf she keeps pushing then you may want to think about couples counseling.\n\nLeslie ruined a good thing because she can't fathom that her friend's husband is genuinely nice instead of wanting to get with her. I've had bad days, currently having one now, and not once have I jumped the gun like this. Leslie needs to get herself into therapy.\n\nYou and your wife should both be taking a step back from helping this much, especially after Leslie's comment about \"just as friends right?\". That was cute or a mistake made when feeling down, that was deliberate.", "Big Yikes. Nope, your relationship with this person when your wife isn't present is over. Talk about \"don't look a gift horse in the mouth\", for the sake of your wellbeing and your relationship with your wife you need to put huge down a huge boundary line. \n\nDefinitely no home alone time and no more car rides. Ick", "Lol huge NTA I would be repeating the points in all the other comments so I\u2019ll just leave it at my vote", "NTA, my danger sensor is beeping xD", "NTA. No way would I help someone who jumped to that conclusion!", "NTA.\nDon\u2019t ever be alone with her", "NTA.  You are not a part of this friendship. They should communicate between the two of them and keep you out of it, especially since Leslie took the message as she did.", "**You are NTA** and I would make sure that \"Leslie\" is blocked on anyway she has to contact you. You are 100% NC and \"Leslie\" and her children should not be allowed back in your home. She is bad news", "I drive carpool for my kids swim team. I always reply to group chat that my wife is also in. I never text the other mom separately.

Wife was dumping the help she was offering on OP, when it should have been her doing it. He did not and doesn't need to help at all. I even siad I don't think he's an AH for not helping. But I can somewhat understand her need to clarify that going to the movies 1:1 with her friends husband was not expected to be a date. Is it shitty she had to question his motives? Absolutely. Does OP have a right to feel upset that his motives were questioned? Absolutely. It's sad this woman has never had a male relationship or someone do something nice for her where they weren't actually interested. Her idea that guys don't do anything or care to check in without expecting something is really unfortunate as it's clearly not true.

So I can understand wanting to clarify what is going on.       \n\nIt is not OPs responsibility to change her outlook on men, but by actually continuing to help her occasionally, or not making it into a big thing, it might actually change her outlook on men. I think he was already helping too much and it should be more on the wife to begin with as I don't agree with offering help and dumping it on someone else, but stopping entirely just for this particular reason  seems unnecessary. I can see myself being understanding in any of these peoples situations. \n\nI think OP fearing accusations is unwarrented.

It\u2019s disgusting to think just because OP was friendly and nice enough to do as his wife requested to help her out that he had any other intentions. The very act of thinking op was anything other than friendly is misogynistic. \n\nIf a man thought a woman wanted sex/romance simply because she was nice and friendly towards him, he would be disgusting.

It's clear she has overestimated their friendship when really the only thing they have in common is her. They need to set a boundary with her.\n\nPersonally, I would be weirded out if my friend set up a movie night or event with my kids and then instead of canceling when she couldn't make it, she just left me alone with her husband.

I've had more dates that consisted of dinner and movies than I can count. I don't blame her for asking for clarification. So much language around dating and romantic interest is vague. \"Wanna get dinner?\" or \"Wanna see a movie?\" *is* often an invitation to a date. If it's ambiguous, ask. To me, at least, that's how you avoid miscommunications. \n\nAnd.... Having been made a single parent by a shitty ex husband.... The number of men who are skeevy about single/divorced moms in some way is both surprising and appalling.

You wife can do as she pleases but make it clear you want no part in it.", "NTA. \n\nI can understand why Leslie was wary -- unfortunately, it's a pretty common scenario -- but it seems her suspicions were unfounded, so keeping your distance is a pretty good way to make sure you avoid any other \"miscommunications\". Also, this is not your friendship, and your wife roping you into escalating involvement was a bad idea to begin with.\n\nNGL, I really thought this whole story was going somewhere else. It sounds to me (a gay woman), like your wife has a crush on Leslie. It doesn't have to be a romantic crush, mind you, since women's relationships aren't so easily defined, but it's definitely intense enough to make me wonder why she's this involved.", "NTA - but I'm super confused on why your wife would assume you're comfortable enough to be in Leslie's presence without HER? Even if your wife puts all her trust in you to be a faithful husband, can we talk about how *awkward* these interactions had to have been? \n\nI have a best friend and we've been best friends for 23 years now. Her husband is a friend that was part of our circle - so I consider him an extension of my best friend. But that wouldn't mean I'd be comfortable hanging out with him without my best friend there. \n\nThe fact that Leslie was obviously uncomfortable enough that she thought she needed to text and clarify that she didn't want excessive attention means that Emily needs to learn how to manage her time better and stop being so oblivious to her loved ones' feelings. Leslie got uncomfortable and OP was just stuck in the middle. Maybe it's not a big deal to Emily, because again, she trusts her husband ... But she's still not ***getting*** the fact that SHE is the only one that doesn't see a problem with these scenarios. So odd to me.", "NTA. It\u2019s entirely possible, Leslie could be developing feelings for the good man in her life. Whether she wants to or not. So she said something stupid. Regardless, you\u2019ve been going above and beyond helping her and I commend you for that. This is not a good situation you wife is putting you into. For you and for Leslie. Please show her the nicer comments in this thread and hopefully she\u2019ll understand the position shes putting you all in. \n\nIf Leslie is developing feeling for you, the last thing she needs is alone time with you. If she\u2019s not, she\u2019s got other issues if she believes a man and a woman can\u2019t be friends. \n\nPoint out to your wife that Leslie all but accused you of being a cheater. That is low. It\u2019s insulting to both you and your wife. \n\nGood luck dude.", "NTA. Stay FAR away from her at this point. She's said how she views your help. It wasnt a bad day. \n\nYour wife is also being naive by sending you guys on trips without her. I am NOT saying you would cheat with Emily, but statistically, either coworkers or 'close friends' are the most likely to become an affair partner. So the forced closeness could eventually backfire and blow up. Or emily could take things wrong and accuse you of inappropriate behavior. \n\nI've seen it happen. Sorry if it sounds so negative", "NTA. Your trying to make your wife happy by helping out her friend and this is what the friend comes back saying?! Basically accusing you of trying to cheat.

Trust your feelings- her response was weird, especially since you've known each other for a long time. Stay away from this woman. Honestly, at first I thought that your wife was setting the stage to pitch you an alternative, semi-open relationship; then, I thought you were getting set up for grounds for separation. I suggest you gently and with compassion repeat to your wife that you feel uncomfortable helping Leslie or being alone with her.  I am very paranoid about these things, so if you can't avoid contact with your wife's long-time BFF, try go record your interactions going forward, to avoid future \"misunderstandings\".", "NTA and you\u2019re right to stay away from Leslie. She sounds like a problem just waiting to happen. She already has it in her mind you want something from her, it\u2019s not a big leap to her accusing you of trying something.

But if they\u2019re as close as you say she\u2019s always going to be in the picture and now things are awkward. Sorry this happened.", "NTA\n\nTo be fair to Leslie as I was reading this, before I got to the end, I thought it possible that Leslie and Emily were easing OP into a thrupple/poly situation. \n\nWhile she handled it completely wrong obviously Leslie is also not comfortable with some of what Emily is doing. It seems especially weird that she makes plans for the families and then doesn\u2019t cancel/reschedule when she can\u2019t make it. \n\nDefinitely time to sit down and make some boundaries not only about this situation but hypothetical ones for the future about how involved op wants to be with his wife\u2019s friends. And definitely a good idea to take a break from helping out for a while. Not as a punishment thing but as a re-establish boundaries way.", "NTA\n\nMost likely she thought those things because she herself was becoming interested in you.  There is NO WAY I would ask or want my husband to be alone with a female friend no matter how much it was helping them.

That was just gross and unacceptable behavior for her regardless of her having a \"down day\". By what I read, it sounds like she never properly apologized to you.

What other morally questionable things would she do for her own benefit?", "NTA as soon as she threw out that accusation, any friendship you may have had with her went out the window.

She took and took and took until she was asked to engage in social time spent together. Totally normal thing for friends to do.

You will be the loser, it will be your fault, and your marriage is under fire.

And why didn\u2019t Emily just text the lady herself That\u2019s the part I really don\u2019t get it. Because the other times the husband stepped in because  Emily and Leslie already have plans But it turns out Emily can\u2019t make it.
