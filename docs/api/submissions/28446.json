Not necessarily that her dad sucks, but how to make the right relationship choices in the future as a woman.", "At the age of 13, your daughter is going to start picking up as to why Dad's having so many girlfriends.  And then she's going to be starting asking questions herself.", "NTA - With the caveat that you explained things in an age-appropriate way that didn\u2019t give your daughter unnecessary details. Your ex is irresponsible and selfish. He\u2019s putting your daughter through a constant rollercoaster of emotions, highs and then heartbreaks. He shouldn\u2019t try to get your daughter attached to these women only to leave them, and leave you to be the shoulder for his exes to cry on.\n\nHe can do whatever he wants with his life, but it shouldn\u2019t be at the detriment of your daughter\u2019s emotional and mental well-being. You need to help level your daughter\u2019s expectations, and no one should be pretending that any of these women are going to be joining the family or being step-moms.\n\nI think telling your ex to hold off for several months before letting your daughter meet any of his romantic interests is smart. That way you can level out if it seems more stable/long-term or not, and it\u2019s less risk n your daughter getting attached only for the relationship to fall apart again.", "NTA your daughters only 13 and that\u2019s her male role model in life? Yikes. I\u2019d definitely tell Annie she deserves to not be cheated on by a loser that\u2019s 10 years older than her. Set a better example for your kid and show her shitty actions have shitty consequences and her dad doesn\u2019t just get to keep playing with women like they\u2019re his personal playthings", "NTA for being honest about his instability in relationships, but why does she need to know about his infidelity? Shes 13. She can clearly see him bounce from one relationship to another. I would let her know that based on his history in relationships its probably not a good idea to get used to annie, and tell her that her dad does not set an example of what a healthy relationship looks like. But really, shes 13. IMO she doesnt need to be told about either of her parents sex lives.", "NTA, they deserve to know. as long as you\u2019re doing it in an age appropriate way and not just trauma dumping on them it should be okay and healthy. if anything get a therapist to help have these difficult conversations", "YTA sorry. Gracie only needed to know that you\u2019d like her to wait a while to meet her, until you know the relationship is long term and stable.\n\nTelling her about the possible (erm\u2026likely) cheating was unnecessary. Kids need to be insulated from all the drama.\n\nShe would have put things together on her own eventually. If she becomes curious she would ask you what happened. That would be the time to tell her. Even then, the cheating might be irrelevant to her. It doesn\u2019t change her relationship with her dad. She loves him unconditionally.\n\nDoes this man never learn though?", "I think YTA here sorry.\nI get your intention to protect your daughter but you didn't need to give a 13 year old the dirty secrets of adult and parent relationships. Especially as it isn't clear Annie knows, and if/when she does, she might forgive him and stick around - leaving your daughter knowing this unnecessarily and having to navigate awkward adult level relationship stuff.\n\nI think you could have lowered your daughter's expectations without getting into the gossip. Simply reminding her that her dad has broken up with women in the past, or that most relationships in general don't last very long let alone end in marriage or forevers would have been fine i think.", "YTA. Adult relationships are not the kid's business. You've put her in a really awkward position where she has to lie to a complete stranger that her father expects her to get along with.", "YWBTA. What makes you think it would be appropriate to tell your daughter that her father is cheating on his current girlfriend? Why would you want to drag her into his sex life drama (more than she already is by meeting a series of girlfriends)?\n\nBack off! You don't need to care except to the extent of enforcing a minimum time before he can introduce his girlfriends to your daughter. And maybe tell him to stop talking up his new gf if it's likely to get broken up in the near future due to infidelity (just a comment, don't have a discussion about it with him).\n\nI have this idea that maybe you and Jasmin should live close and co-parent, lol.\n\nEDIT: I can't believe the folks telling you to go ahead and tell your daughter her father is cheating! I mean, is she then supposed to keep that secret when she meets Annie?? Worst ideas ever. SMH", "Edit: OP didn't tell the daughter that, but explained herself only under later comments without editing the post until now. If other INFO arrives in bits as an reaction, there is no way to form an oppinion.\n\nI see no reason why it would benefit a 13-year old to know all of that but I can imagine that a cuckolded past flame could get some satisfaction out of it. Also you don't know how it turns out between dad and Annie nor is it your business, it's just gossip. It was not your truth to tell, he is her father and you don't write anything that makes him look bad as a dad, just as a boyfriend, so what's the deal here? I get the guy is lost but that doesn't give you the right to spoil his relationship with his daughter and her not getting attached seems like an excuse to brush off invasive behaviour. YTA, not for wanting to protect your kid, not for being f... over by her dad and hurting, but for pushing your kid one step further into having daddy issues she doesn't get from what her dad does but what she knows about it.", "YTA this can easily be construed as manipulation or ostracizing a parent and child. Now that sounds extreme I know but you\u2019ve basically \u201ctalked bad\u201d about the other parent to her. We don\u2019t know what you said or how you said it but bad mouthing the other parent is never good. Is he good to your daughter? If so, then his mistakes that don\u2019t hurt her are not yours to air. \n\nAdult up, talk to him about new ground rules when he has a girlfriend and when he should even be talking about them to your daughter.

Your daughter deserves better from everyone.", "Daughter needs to be in therapy asap!", "What's your real motive?

I thought he met Annie after he'd broken it off with Jasmine so she's not really a home wrecker?\n\nETA:  now I've reread your post it looks like he told you he was going to break off with Jasmine but it took a while for it to actually happen.

You are WAY too invested in this soap opera. \n\nIf I was in your shoes, Id be going to court for SUPERVISED visitation because CLEARLY he doesnt care about his daughter worth a plugged nickel!\n\nYOU exposing her to this toxicity-YTA. \n\nYOU chose him-not her.

It takes a lot for a parent to lose all legally protected access to their child. Daughter is going to have to deal with his messy relationships until/unless she decides, *on her own*, that she doesn\u2019t want to see him anymore. And that means dealing with the nasty cycle of getting attached to dad\u2019s girlfriends, watching dad pull away from those girlfriends, and then being told one day that those girlfriends are gone and she\u2019ll have to get used to the new woman who\u2019s suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

Learning the truth about your shit dad at 13 doesn't make you do a Sailor Moon transformation into a teen mom, and honestly it reflects poorly on you that you've decided to use as your argument. \n\nLol, okay, you're being down voted as the hero too brave for reddit to handle, definitely not for being weirdly overwrought.", "Since I found out that he is now cheating on the new GF I have talked to him however I didn\u2019t want to let him know that I knew that. \nI did say I wanted to make sure he was still thinking about introducing Gracie to Annie and he said \u201cabsolutely , we are getting serious\u201d I told him that I knew that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he was faithful and I asked him if by chance he was in an open relationship. He said no and said he was going to introduce her to his daughter mid November. The therapist is more my daughters, I have not been to a session with her since she was 12. She wants me to wait in the waiting room for her.", "That's exactly what I'm saying, fool. I'm saying not all 13 yr olds learn about sex.", "That's your opinion. 13 is still a child.

By 13 they probably have a period or get boners, they should know how the reproductive system works.

I said it should be age appropriate.

I want to know the SPECIFIC age that you think is appropriate to teach TEENAGERS (13-19) about sex and contraceptives."]}
