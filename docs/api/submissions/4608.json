I'm sorry, and no disrespect to your parents, but anyone who responds to a request to be considerate of you and your guests at your wedding with \"this is just who we are\" has got their head up their ass.\n\nObnoxious AH is not a defendable personality type.", "NTA.  They want to be who they are, you are not interfering in that at all. But no-one says you have to let them be who they \u2018are\u2019 at your important events.

You\u2019re *not* expecting them to change.  That\u2019s the point.  They literally told you to expect bad behavior if you invited them.

And it's obvious they'd repeat the same behavior at OP's wedding. And their excuse \"that's just who we are\". Honestly it's so ridiculous when people refuse to acknowledge and take accountability for their mistakes. Enjoy your special day, congrats on getting married :)", "NTA\n\nIf they aren't paying, they don't have a guaranteed spot, even if they're family.

If your parents cannot control their own behavior for one afternoon/night that says a lot about them and their priorities. \n\nI hope you have a beautiful easy breezy wedding OP! Congrats!", "NTA\nThey outright said you can expect them to act the same at your wedding.", "NTA it's not really expecting people to change, it's just asking people to be on their best behaviour. We all do that. I don't act the same at work as I do at home. I don't act the same at a wedding as I do when I'm out with my friends. Most people are able to modify their behaviour depending on the specific event they're at. If your parents are refusing to do that then that's their choice but then they can't come.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice.  \nThey have warned you that they won't behave/ change their ways for your wedding. \n\nYou told them that what you saw at your sister's wedding is not what you wanted at yours and they told you they wouldn't change.   \nSo this is how shitty behaviour reaps shitty rewards. Their own actions ensured that they can't be trusted. Since you don't want to worry on what the heck they will do, you told them not to come to part of your wedding celebration.   \nHarsh? Yeah. Necessary? absolutely? They aren't paying so they don't get to decide.", "NTA. You didn't actually kick them out of your wedding; you told them what conditions and behavior you wanted your guests to follow, and they refused to agree to that basic code.\n\nYou're not abandoning them here. They're abandoning you.

Regardless of whether or not I agree with your reasons, it\u2019s your wedding and you get to decide who gets to be there.

And they're still invited to the wedding just not the reception. I mean I understand the music asking DJ to occasionally play different songs so everybody can enjoy it but everything else was out of line", "NTA. They have a choice - take a step back and tone it down for an event that isn't centered around them (a very reasonable ask) or be relegated to guest status. This isn't you asking them to not be themselves; this is you asking them to not take over your event.\n\nIf they want to insist that their personality is that they do and will take over any event as they please, then they can expect their 'personality' to affect their invitations to events. It's your personality to not want to be run roughshod at your own wedding, and you are not going to change for anyone.", "NTA\n\n>The other half is saying that my parents are who they are\n\nAnd? So because they're naturally AHs means you're supposed to allow that? F all of that.", "NTA. They told you they are going to ruin your wedding. Best they be away and sulk than you have your party destroyed by them.", "NTA   It's your wedding and you're paying for it.  Allowing them to attend the ceremony but not the reception is totally fair.  And you can tell your family members that you're NOT expecting them to change, which is exactly why they aren't invited.\n\nMy only question is - since they're such steamrollers, how are you going to prevent them crashing the reception?  They sound like the kind of people who wouldn't think twice about showing up uninvited.", "YTA, you are describing normal parent behavior at weddings.  At every wedding I have been to, the photographer took a picture of each table.  Which is how family groups are divided up usually.  Are you saying that you don't want at least one picture of each guest (not individual pictures)?  Geez, do they have to pay for the wedding to request a song they can dance to?  I can understand why you don't want a scene, but it seems like you hate your parent's personalities.  I can't believe they still want to attend after hearing you this.\n\nFor clarity\n\nterrible speeches?  Is there curse words?  personal attacks?\n\ncrappy music?  oldies?\n\nextra work for the photographer can be dealt with by planning ahead and sharing that specific cost.  Perhaps, having them pay for an assistant photographer that takes all these extra pictures.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There HAS to be much more anger and vitriol toward his parents than what he described at the sister\u2019s wedding.

Doesn't anyone know how to set limits?  Like sure, Mom, each family pose costs X and the print selection sheet costs X and prints are X, and if I get that many poses then an assistant cost X.

Should they *have* to deal with that?  No.  If I know someone\u2019s going to pull that kind of behavior, and talking to them about not doing it hasn\u2019t helped, then why make everyone\u2019s lives harder by setting up a situation where it\u2019s going to happen?", "That isn't what they tried.
