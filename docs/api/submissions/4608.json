Anyone else gets told that the shot list is set.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the print sales for me. It\u2019s about the workload. Every wedding is already more than enough. I\u2019m not squeezing in an entire extended family portrait session on top of it.", "So true\u2026.", "NO NON O! THAT IS PURE EVIL. THEY ARE INDECENT HUMAND BEINGS!!!!!!1!1!!1!!", "We had our photographer take candids during the reception. He spent an hour walking around shooting and also asked some people to pose. We ended up with great shots (my 80 year old aunt shaking her head about in the hokey pokey! My 1 year old nephew in a tiny tux dancing with a cousin he just met that day!)\n\nBut me guests were not so rude as to demand anything from him. NTA.", "Yeah, that didn't happen at my wedding or any of the other weddings I attended. Unless it was ruled by the ones who payed for photos. Another American thing, I guess... Your weddings are even more crappy that they show in movies, seems to me.", "And this is why I\u2019m making a playlist for our wedding and it will be the only music played. No DJ or band, just my playlist through Sonos speakers in the venue. \n\nMy mom can dance her little heart out to the music I like. \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23", "So what if you're speech is merely meh and not great, does that make you a borderline indecent human being? What if you make a great speech? Does that make you a great human being?\n\nBill Cosby could give a hell of a toast; where does he end up?\n\nGhandi was dog shit at speeches? Why was he such an indecent human being?\n\nMartin Luther King Jr was great at speeches, but his speeches were wildly off topic for a wedding. Where does he land on the decency scale?\n\nPlease elaborate so everyone can fully understanding how much your ability to give a speech impacts the quality of person you are. Don't forget to cite your sources.", "I've seen that pretty often in packages. The couple gets Album A, which is what they select. There are also smaller size albums (usually 2) for the parents of the couple. Photographer has a link to the final pictures, person who gets Album B selects their pictures, person who gets Album C selects their pictures. That way, everyone's happy with their pictures, and it's minimal extra work for the photographer.", "Because the wedding couple should give a hoot about their guests! Do you want guests enjoying themselves and dancing or sitting bored?", "He didn\u2019t say his sister paid for her wedding, just that he is paying for his.  He also said the speech was bad not obnoxious, no explanation for how or why. Most wedding DJ\u2019s take guest input into the song choices, sounds to me like they pushed harder than most, which is why I think they\u2019re obnoxious, and I see a lot weddings where families not in the wedding get a photograph of them and their family together. They just pushed it further again. Maybe you just have lower thresholds for what is abhorrent behavior than I do, or you are just reading into the situation more than what was written. Either way, I don\u2019t see this discussion moving forward in an interesting way for either of us. Have a good one.", "Oh really? Please elaborate how you know they \"deliberately made an obnoxious speech.\"", "Same with our band. Added it to the contract.", "different people have different priorities, what a shock", "I read somewhere that the person who hires the photographer has sole ownership of those phots once they pay, of course \u2026so technically if some bozo or group asked the photographer to take any pictures not sanctioned by the person paying for the photos , what happens to them would be at the bride and groom's discretion \u2026\u2026that means she could buy them with her package and not give the photographer the rights to sell them to someone else. The bride would or could refuse to give them to the bozo who took time away from the photographer who should have been taking pictures of other things or the bride could charge them for time wasted on them. Either way, bride would be making that call.", "I'm not trying to defend the parents here, just replying to someone's comment about the pictures with my own experience. \n\nI can only speak for myself, but I grew up in a family masonry business doing actual hard work every day starting at like 13 or 14 in the summers  and hating every second of it for years. I couldn't imagine being upset over being asked to take some extra pictures that I'm being paid a whole lot more money for..", "I'm not American.  My wedding was lovely.", "If I'm charging a couple grand to take pictures for the night, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. It would be different if it was somehow interfering with the shots I needed to get, but it's generally pretty harmless.", "Lol, now I have a picture of MLK doing his I have a dream speech at a wedding. Thanks for that", "Yeah, because giving a crappy speech is the ONLY THING listed in the original post that they did wrong.", "Imagine being such a boring guest; hell: being such a boring, stick-in-the-mud *person*, that you can't dance to any music while supposedly celebrating your loved ones' wedding lmao\n\nEdit: of *course* your name is Gary \ud83d\ude02", "If a guest is sulking in the corner because they're not hearing the specific songs they want, that's their problem", ">Most wedding DJ\u2019s take guest input\n\nAnd there is nothing worse than your DJ going off script and throwing off the flow to jam in a song that one person is requesting. \n\nMost DJs these days work with the bride/groom to curate a pre-set list based on their preferences seeing as it is their wedding. They\u2019ll craft \u201cnever play\u201d songs and \u201cmust play\u201d songs and then fill in the rest to create a seamless flow between songs. \n\nMy brother\u2019s DJ told us any requests day-of would need to come from the bride/groom or MOH/BM. Even then he advised us that the best experience is one where we don\u2019t fiddle day of. Otherwise, his advice was to plug in someone\u2019s phone and use Spotify.", "Yeah we definitely send the photos to bride or groom not to the person who asked for the \"extra\" photos, so it would be up to them whether they shared them or not. I actually wonder about this sometimes, people ask me to take their picture but do they ever even see it?", "But it means the that the photographer doesn't have the time to take the pictures the married couple *actually* want. There really isn't time to set up and get multiple groups of people to pose for pictures decently, then set up for different shots of the rest of the wedding party, then set up for pictures of the reception, not to mention candid shots... It's just a lot. And if there's 200 extra pictures of group shots that weren't planned, that's SO much extra work for the photographer to go through.", "I\u2019m very upset because I typed out a response to you and then my cat immediately walked across it and deleted it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f so if you\u2019re wondering what happened to whoever tried to respond to you\u2026.welp", "Mine was just fun :)", "Oh, I didn't mean that you as a photographer (I don't even know if that is right word, but my non-English ass will take it...) was neglecting your duties, not at all. In my culture it is just not heard of bothering photographer to shoot family photos and taking his time just like that by guests. I put it under your comment, since you delivered professional input of that being actually common thing :)", "I think we found daddy dearest, proving how obnoxious he is based on his comments on this thread...", "my thoughts exactly. Its a wedding, if you can't find it in you to celebrate unless your specific tastes are met then you can leave. IDC about catering to such entitled stuffy snobs.", "Yikes! Seemed unnecessary! If the wedding couple only cares about themselves and not if guests have a nice time, ok. Maybe it\u2019s a regional thing. Most weddings I\u2019ve attended there is a variety of music cuz some love country and others hate it! And Gary is Sponge Bob\u2019s pet snail which I think is adorable. I\u2019m a women btw.", "Probably not if they've monopolized the photographer's time. I read on here where a couple took the photographer aside and asked her to do engagement photos and that the bride had ok'd it\u2026..not ! They kept calling the bride for their pics. She posted on here and the consensus was not to give them to them unless they paid the bride what a photographer would have charged them for the shoot\u2026wonder how that worked out?", "There are definitely photographers that I've been around who agree with you, I personally just never thought it was a big deal. The way I see it you never know when that drunk uncle who pulls you aside for a picture is going to have one of his own kids getting married and need a photographer.", "[deleted]"]}
