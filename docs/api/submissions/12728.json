{"id": 12728, "submission_id": "11w3k1p", "title": "AITA: For telling my fathers widow I no longer agreed to give her any money.", "selftext": "  \n\nThe story started out for my family when my mom passed in a sudden accident. My father not one to be alone started dating Sally 9 months after. Sally and my dad married, 2 years after my mother passed. 5 months after my dad remarried his health turned suddenly and he passed, due to poor health.\n\nSally called to let me know, and said that it was so sad me and Andrea had lost both our parents so young. She also said she didn\u2019t want my parent\u2019s money it was last thing we had left of our parents. \n\nI threw myself into the task of closing my parent\u2019s life. I contacted lawyers, banks, and consolidated assets. The short time my dad was with Sally he had paid off her house. As well as bought her a new SUV and remodeled her backyard. Also from what I can tell he gave her $1k a week. All in she received about $400k that I could find.\n\nWhile I was moving his stuff to the car, Sally had cornered Andrea and asked her to talk to me about money. She wanted 50k and she wouldn\u2019t need to petition the court for her spousal full third. Her friends had gotten into her ear about what was rightfully hers. No matter how short the marriage.\n\nI agreed $50k wasn\u2019t too bad and there would still be a decent amount for me and Andrea. The AITA situation arose when over the year long period for the estate to close I kept getting calls from Sally saying stuff like. Your dad left me destitute. I don\u2019t have any money. And when can I get that 50k. She also said to Andrea that if her name was on the accounts before my father passed the money would just be hers. I was getting bitter. After everything she got from my dad, in my eyes she had won the lottery and she wanted more.\n\nAnd then one day I snapped, about 2 months before the estate closed she was complaining to me about money again. I stopped playing nice, I told her everything my father had done for her, and how she said she didn\u2019t want our inheritance. I said I didn\u2019t even have the time to mourn the passing of my father due to her constant stress about money.\n\nMy final words to her and the last time we talked were. \u201cI think you should get a lawyer. If the money my parents earned during their life is so important to you, then you should petition the court for your \u201cfair\u201d share. As I am not interested in giving you what we agreed to anymore. \n\nThe two months came and went, the estate closing went smoothly and my parent\u2019s final wishes were executed exactly to their wishes. Well what came next came as a little bit of surprise. I got a letter in the mail saying that I owed her money from a verbal agreement in the amount of $100k. She even inflated the amount she said we agreed to. Our lawyer said we should offer $20k to settle out of court. Sally jumped at the opportunity to take more of my parents money and it was settled.\n\nI guess the AITA moment I am curious about is: AITA for getting fed up and telling her to get a lawyer if she wanted any money from my parents estate. And not sticking to the original agreement?", "created_utc": 1679273634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11w3k1p/aita_for_telling_my_fathers_widow_i_no_longer/", "score": 320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have the patience of an absolute saint. She needed money so bad she could\u2019ve sold the house and downsized or the car. There were options for her.  Also how legitimate was that letter? Did she have proof of a verbal agreement because I seriously doubt that would\u2019ve held up in court anyways and the petty monster in me would\u2019ve let that ride all the way to a judge.", "NTA. But you should\u2019ve talked to the lawyer before agreeing to anything and had it drawn up in paper.", "NTA, she went back on her word and then used the opportunity to try for even more money. Sounds like your dad did a lot for her but her true colors weren\u2019t revealed until after he was gone.", "I\u2019ll let you decide- is it right to let your emotions get the better of you, and go back on your word?\n\nShe\u2019s clearly an asshole. Inheritances, and who should get what is hardly ever easy. It never has been in our family. She went back on what she had told you, initially. She lied and went after more, but that\u2019s her lawyers play. Same as your lawyer lowballing at $20k. The upside is, she isn\u2019t your family, and she won\u2019t be missed.", "NTA, and it looks like you saved yourself 30k (minus lawyer fees)", "NTA, she treated your dad as a cash cow when he was alive and she is not entitled to your inheritance", "NTA. Judging by the constant whining, it should have been sent to the lawyer sooner", "NTA. You honored your parents wishes. End of. And. I don\u2019t know exactly how old she is, but I do know if she\u2019s destitute at her age, that\u2019s on her.", "NTA she lacked tact, hounded you, and fucked around and found out. Good for you for holding your ground. I am very sorry for your loss. I hope it all works out.", "NTA.\n\nI would have started recording her without her knowing. Verbal agreements don\u2019t work without proof unless she tricked you into making the statement in front of witnesses or a recording. Your dad had a will, right?

Rest easy.", "NTA she\u2019s a greedy hag and deserves nothing else. Good riddance .", "NTA You barely had time to mourn your mother before this woman entered your lives. Your father did a lot for this woman when it came to finances and money and she still wanted more. You and your sister weren't even allowed to mourn the loss of your father before this greedy woman started to demand more. Consider her and you lucky that she got what she got and you're finally rid of her.", "Did sally kill your dad? Sounds sketchy", "NTA. Their marriage was quite short and she would be unlikely to have gotten much as a spousal share as that depends on the length of the marriage", "I felt the same upon the request, I had to keep it together though. But due to the state they where married in all she needed to do was petition the court and she would have gotten 6 times what she initially requested. Which in the end would have taken a considerable amount of what was left for myself and my sister. The letter was legit from a law firm. I had a very good lawyer and her words wouldnt fit in the 3000 characters i can use to tell my story. But she basically said, \"We can take 2 years and $20k in lawyer fee's defending you in court, which I'll win\". \"Or we can offer the $20k to her and make her sign an agreement that says her and anyone else related to her can't ever come after you or your sister\". And so thats what we decided to do.", "Lesson learned on that one. The two people I would come to for advice where both gone and I had never dealt with anything like this before.", "Mid 50's if i remember correctly. I'm not sure on her situation but I think she was trying to manipulate me at this point. Which didn't work because I knew what was in my parents trust and would follow it to the letter for them.", "She will never ever be in my life ever again. Shes my father mistake I had to deal with.", "Delete this. You don\u2019t need her lawyer getting this and using it as an admission. Talk to your lawyer before posting anything about this situation.", "Jesus the court shouldn\u2019t even consider a marriage that short when your parents had an active will that named their CHILDREN as beneficiaries especially when your mother contributed to the financial part too. At least your lawyer got her to leave you the heck alone. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that and that you lost both of your parents so tragically and so close together. I lost my own mother due to COVID in February last year and it was a nightmare. She also lied to my father about both of them having life insurance policies, having to break that news to my father was so hard. I am his only child and he can\u2019t live alone so he moved in with me and my 2 girls. He\u2019s 64 retired and has been having a lot of health related issues as well lately. Having that  policy would be helping us so much right now because we are struggling so much without it.", "Fair enough. Just moving forward, don\u2019t loan money to people and expect it back. I only loan what I can afford to lose. If you make a money deal with someone, let them know you\u2019re recording and get it down on paper if you don\u2019t have lawyers present. You got this.", "Wouldn\u2019t the agreement she signed prevent her from doing that ?", "Kinda depends.  I was with my husband for years but we only married 3 months before he died.  (Cancer we had no idea he had.  Horrible).", "It should, but it\u2019s not worth the risk. The woman already came back to reopen a closed estate once, and she might claim fraud if anything OP said is not 100% consistent with the positions her lawyer took. The truth is that whatever the end result should be, people can and do drag people into stupid lawsuits all the time, and it takes time and money to deal with it.", "My husband died 2 years ago. All my money is in trust for my daughter should I pass. I will under no circumstances remarry for this reason you have described", "I\u2019m terribly sorry for your loss, I\u2019d like to adjust my statement to they should consider the longevity of a relationship then.", "NTA.\n\nYou've been patient enough. Sally is a gold digging parasite. She can just fade away now.", "NTA I am sorry for your loss", "NTA.\n\nYou are allowed to change your mind. Esp on a matter of this nature.\n\nTry not to lose too much sleep over it.", "NTA - she totally milked your poor father during his life time and their very short marriage.  \u20ac400k !!  He was a very nice man and I suppose he hoped to live a long comfortable life with her.\n\n50k on a verbal agreement isn't worth the paper its written on but its the cost of litigation. Perhaps in that jurisdiction, she is entitled to 1/3 of the assets that form part of his estate. \n\nIndeed it was a stressful time and peoples memories are fuzzy.  You were clearing out your parents home when she approached you and had a great deal on your mind.  Can you be sure what number was mentioned?", "Delete this you smart girl.", "I wonder how many husbands she's had whose \"health turned suddenly\"?", "> She needed money so bad she could\u2019ve sold the house and downsized or the car. There were options for her.\n\nmickey d's hiring right now", "She absolutely tried to manipulate you. Tried. Good on you that she didn\u2019t succeed."]}
