However, this whole situation comes off as SUPER controlling behavior from her part.", "NTA.  You set a hard and fast boundary and she violated it.  And then violated it again.\n\nAnd then got mad at you for calling her on it.\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 can't get this straight in her head, then you may need to make some hard choices about what kind of future your relationship has.", "NTA\n\nyou told her she wasn't looking for a mum, she is definitely behaving like one which is weird", "NTA.  You sir currently have a fiance problem.  Solve this now before it becomes an evil stepmother and/or daughter problem.\n\nBig red flag that fiance is trying to insert herself where she was forewarned was not appropriate to try assert dominance/control over a 15 year old.  That course doesn't end well for anyone involved.", "NTA I would rethink living together right now & postpone any thoughts of marriage until your daughter is 18 and off to college. Even if your daughter has gotten in trouble, has poor grades & is a delinquent your fianc\u00e9e should have discussed things with you before trying to control your daughter. She is totally in the wrong here & you need to be concerned about her controlling & abusive attitude toward your daughter.", "NTA - you set up boundaries which she accepted and she has to respect them. Sounds like she has issues trying to control other people and thinks your daughter is the ideal victim to do that.", "NTA. I don't actually see where this was about discipline; Kylie had plans to go out and there's nothing to suggest she'd been badly behaved and shouldn't be allowed to go out.\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9e wants Kylie to respect her, not talking over her would be a good place to start.", "NTA. Single mom here, and I get it. She ISN'T your daughter's parent, period. You made your boundary clear in the beginning and she indicated that she understood. It's not your fault she's trying to flip things around now. She can either deal or go, your daughter's comfort comes first. It's pretty simple.", "NTA.\n\nI think the only way this relationship can work is either through counseling and/or for you two to live separately until your daughter is in college/moved out.", "NTA\n\nWould be a deal breaker for me in a relationship, if I was to completely ignore a child doing things i did not agree with, but fiance was told ahead of time and accepted the terms", "NTA.  You told your fiancee about the nacho parenting.  She isn't stepping back to let you handle it.  It's good to find out now if fiancee is capable of stepping back or not.  She may be such a control freak that she feels compelled to parent.  Maybe let her know that it isn't because you have a lack of confidence in her ability to parent.  It is the style of parenting that you and your daughter have chosen.", "Kid is way past \u201cneeding\u201d a mom. Nta", "NTA\n\nI applaud you for thinking about your daughter first.

This whole \u201cshe does it in a way that I can\u2019t say anything until after the fact\u201d is a BS argument - all it takes is \u201cI rather you not drive her to school anymore\u201d. \u201cI rather you do not pick her up from school anymore\u201d. \u201cI rather that you direct her to me when she asks for a ride going forward\u201d. \u201cI rather that you not clean up after her, she\u2019s 16 and will do it on her own\u201d. Consistently. All in all you should really wait until your daughter is out of the house to continue this relationship, but if that\u2019s not a realistic possibility for you as a pair, then you have to stand your ground every time, not only when it\u2019s a disservice to you or your daughter.", "NTA since you were clear about your boundaries.

If you want to keep that attitude fine. But stop taking advantage of the plus side of having other adult around and then throwing a fit when it doesn\u2019t fit the narrative you want!  Also pretty clear your daughter are pitting you to against each and  it is working beautifully for her.", "[deleted]", "ESH.\n\nImagine living with a kid and them acting out. Potentially smashing things or doing something that requires corrective action, but not being able to do so. \n\nBoundaries were made clear, so I get that you aren't fully an asshole, but this seems like it would strain the relationship between your fiance and child, because the fiance is unable to act like a parent to your child, for good and bad parts. And in return if your child truly acted out, your fiance would just have to sit there and deal until you decided to correct the action. These are a lot of \"what if\" scenarios though. \n\nYour fiance is an asshole for overstepping your boundaries and also trying to keep your child from the group study, but honestly at that age, she's right, kids don't study. At least at my school we never did in a group environment. \n\nIf you two were to have a child together, would your fiance be able to parents then? Because what if she favors the biological child over the child she could never parent? I don't know, this just seems like a overall hard situation. Good luck my friend and I hope the outcome that occurs is one that you are satisfied with!", "I was going to say NTA but I think it should actually be ESH.\n\nFianc\u00e9e sucks for massively overstepping with restricting Kylie\u2019s movements - assuming though that Kylie wasn\u2019t going out alone late at night, suspected drug use etc. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot that\u2019s not included in this post however about what you expected the relationship between Kylie and Fianc\u00e9e was supposed to be. Are they roommates?? Doesn\u2019t seem reasonable considering the fact that she is your fianc\u00e9e and an adult. She has to have some authority here. It feels like you both need to communicate the nuances of those boundaries and what is and what is not allowed considering you are living together and presumably will be in this situation for at least 3 more years.\n\nEdit: Kylie going out late at night could be an issue because she is a minor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I will say, and I\u2019m guessing this is the case since you seem like a reasonable human being and father, that there should be some house rules that everybody is expected to follow.  Your fianc\u00e9 should also have some leeway to *help* enforce those if it\u2019s ever necessary. For example, if the rule is that everybody takes their dishes to the sink and your daughter does not, fianc\u00e9 should have the right to say \u201chey remember to take your dishes to the sink.\u201d  If daughter refuses, fianc\u00e9e should have the right to enforce a consequence you\u2019ve already put in place.

We don\u2019t think anything about these people having some level of authority over our children.  A stepparent, however, can be put in the position of having every interaction under a microscope and result in feeling like you don\u2019t have a place in your own home or even that you have to compromise your own boundaries due to the perceptions around enforcing them (eg \u201cI wont be spoken to like that\u201d).  That can be an extremely rough place to be.\n\nIn your example, your fianc\u00e9 is unilaterally deciding to change the existing status quo because she thinks she knows better than you.

It\u2019s seems it would be worth your while to have a really good discussion with your fianc\u00e9e to find out if there has been some other dynamic at play of which you\u2019ve been totally unaware, especially before you decide to terminate your relationship.\n\nYou may find out she has indeed been stealthily and intentionally putting herself in the role of a parent.  You may find she\u2019s so hyper focused on being a parent (wanting a baby) that she just can\u2019t help herself.  You also may find that there is some straw that broke the camels back along the way and this particular interaction was born out of that.\n\nBeing a stepparent is hard and a big adjustment.

A town population of 3,600, also pulled in couple smaller towns for the district.\nThe teachers were all biased, players were ignored when bullying/pranking/causing trouble.  As long as attendance is kept up and they pass the class.\nI tried joining a couple study groups on the rare chance I heard of one...oops, we're full, go find someone else.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019ve been a single parent for the vast majority of my teenager\u2019s life and I empathize with you, Op! It takes an incredible amount of effort, time, trust, trials and (many, many) errors to develop a harmonious parent + child relationship. If someone came into our lives and messed with it, I would throw hands\u2026 it was one of the many reasons why my ex, who wasn\u2019t their bio-dad, and I divorced.  \n\nI\u2019m now with a lovely human who understands our unique rhythm and never tries to insert himself when unasked, discipline, nor \u201cparent\u201d my child.  Instead, he talks to me, we talk it out but generally just has my back on the rough days and celebrates with me with the good ones \u2014 they\u2019ve developed a bond/relationship organically and I\u2019m very grateful.\n\nThrough both of these experiences I\u2019ve learned two things:\n- People rarely conceptualize how much adaptation is required of them when they step into parent/parent-adjacent roles. It\u2019s like starting at a new job and onboarding can be a little rough but ultimately, you have to adapt to the structure and boundaries of the new place, otherwise chaos ensues and productivity stops/  By productivity I mean, raising a well-adjusted, self sustainable human with healthiesh emotional processing.  \n- When you invite newcomers in, while yes, you may have been upfront or transparent about you + your daughter\u2019s unique rhythm, it\u2019s an incredibly hard feat to be 60% less selfish while giving up 90% control of your environment for another human, let alone one that you don\u2019t get to really set the parameters of a relationship with. So I feel like some grace should be given for these people because it\u2019s hard for them too.\n\nWith that said, while I dislike when any adult throws their weight around with undue authority, I\u2019m erring on the side of \u201cmaybe it\u2019s not coming from malicious intent\u201d to inquire if there\u2019s been some sort of recent event to cause this paradigm shift?  While yes, the two of you moved in together and she\u2019s trying to figure out her place \u2014 she\u2019s been aware of your boundaries regarding your child for years, so it seems both odd and  presumptuous she\u2019d aggressively assert herself as such. Maybe it might merit a discussion to emphasize your boundary \u2014 but also check in to see where it\u2019s coming from, or if it\u2019s always been there and now revealing itself to you because you moved in together. Who knows.\n\nI do want to commend you on advocating for your child and supporting her and most of all, continuing to make her feel valued during these new times and changes.", "I was around 10 or 12 when I decided that unless he earned respect from *me*, I wasn't going to blindly obey any of my mom's bf's, even if they got married. He had to earn the title dad if he wanted it, which would only take a good relationship with me and treating me with respect. (My mom didn't date the most stellar guys though, so the bar was pretty low). \n\nAnyways. NTA. Your daughter is old enough to know your rules. Fianc\u00e9e is overstepping your clearly set boundaries *while* disrespecting your daughter. If you support your fianc\u00e9e, then our daughter *will* push away from you. Although the opposite may be true as well, but only one lady will definitely be linked to you for life, whether or not they remain in contact is the question.", "You don't sound exactly like the model parent. I think ETA but you especially. Your fiancee is coming into your life as your partner, not your subordinate. You do have a duty to put your daughter first in some instances, but she appears here to be acting in the child's best interest. You are simply trying to flex some power over them both and drive a wedge between them. This would definitely be red flag territory to me if she wants to fet out before it is too late. What happens when you all have kids of your own? Will you expect her to treat your daughter equally? Will you undermine your wife in front of them also?", "Nta and some of these people need to learn to read so op doesn\u2019t have to say it 1000x freakin times. SHE RANDOMLY STARTED DOING THINGS EVEN THOUGH OP HAS BEVER ASKED AND NEVER WANTED HER TO DO THEM. HES TOLD HER TO STOP MULTIPLE TIMES AND SHE DOESNT. ALSO HE DOESNT EXPECT HER TO PAY FOR ANYTHING REGARDING HIS DAUGHTER. I hope so of the dimwits who don\u2019t understand boundaries can now stop commenting things to this nature. Op I wish you and your daughter the best of luck, you are an amazing parent.", "Nta. Not at all. And i see so many set that boundary then give in because they don't want to argue or whatever reason. There is no reason she cant come to you if she has or sees an issue. Ive been a step mom for over 30yrs. She was a yr & a half when we got together. We had her a lot. Around 10ish her mom started using & we had her afterwards. I still didnt try to parent her. That wasnt my place, wasnt my job. I still don't understand why so many ppl think being a step parent isnt enough or isnt good enough. I absolutely love it. Very proud to be. If she asks, i give her advise or whatever but I don't parent her.", "NTA.  I think you should have a private conversation with your daughter and find out what other boundaries have been crossed, because I guarantee this wasn\u2019t the first time.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is very manipulative and controlling. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "All good but please ensure she doesn't do any parenting at all. No driving, pick ups, meals or laundry and then you will have a perfectly separated family and they can co exist without issue.  Good luck.  But please don't expect her to do any chores for your child and have zero say...that would be hypocritical.", "It\u2019s basically like the relationship with a friends kid or babysitting, if the parent isn\u2019t there and something serious happens u tell the parent. if the child is doing something dangerous you try and stop the child. The whole alarm clock thing and small stuff like that isn\u2019t really parenting it\u2019s more just are you gonna be a decent person and say \u201chey it *insert time* I just don\u2019t want you to run late for *place/thing*\u201d This is all most likely discussed differently which each family. And tbh if I ever became a step parent or my SO became a step parent, I\u2019d follow a similar approach.", "So it\u2019s ok for her to scream at op\u2019s daughter for literally going to the library to do homework?", "A neighbor drove me to school when I was a teen - should she have been allowed to decide if I\u2019m able to go out at night before homework?\n\nYour threshold for who gets to parent is ridiculously low.", "I\u2019ve gotten into the WORST habit of falling asleep to something streaming on my iPad right next to me\n\nI\u2019m trying to break the habit, but it\u2019s rough.  Hence why I\u2019m awake on Reddit at nearly 3am.\n\nMy brain is now used to whatever rando sounds it\u2019s decided it needs in order to fall asleep.", "NTA ur fiancee is a dumbass, not even letting her talk while she waw arguing, bruh", "Unless she speaks chinese and you explained in japanese - NTA\n\nI understand you explained, you made clear, you listed things and set a hard boundary.  \nShe ignored the explanations, she muddied up your clarifications, she tore up the lists, and she crossed the boundary.\n\nThis tells me either she has severe issues understanding directions (unless the first line was true of course) or she DOES NOT CARE about either YOU or YOUR child. And that would be a line she should NOT cross, as that means she is using you for.. i dunno - but she is not accepting you as partner, undermining you as partner and is upsetting your child for.. her own gain ? He fantasy \"i\\`m a good mommy\" (starting with a 15 year old? Herding cats is easier).?\n\nAnd when pointed out - she gets upset??? and does not want to talk about it because 'she' is mad? \n\nI am not sure how many more red flags you need - but I do not really see a happy future for you and her with this.   \nNow she\\`s forcing her ideas on your daughter - what\\`s next? Fashion police? Boyfriend inspection? Bank account control?", "As a step parent myself NTA.\n I co-parent per se with my fiance because that is what he has asked of me and my step daughters mum has asked of me as well. If my fiance or her mum told me they weren't comfortable with me disciplining her then I wouldn't. My step daughter is 5 so there is a huge difference.\nIn so many step parent groups I'm in Nachoing is brought up a lot. If that is what you prefer then that is up to you.", "NTA. Dump her. This is a mere glance at how she will torture your daughter for her own twisted needs the rest of your short years left with Kylie at home. Take this chance. And don't leave Kylie hanging, make sure you talk to her and let her express her feelings too", "I\u2019m with you on this. It doesn\u2019t seem like, in this one example at least, that the fianc\u00e9 was speaking to the daughter respectfully. However, it feels like the fianc\u00e9 is being reprimanded and treated like a second daughter rather than a partner. It doesn\u2019t feel like there is room for her in the family. There also appears to be some issues with the power dynamics. \n\nSure, you can set boundaries and expect others to follow them. That\u2019s reasonable. At what point will you decide the relationship isn\u2019t working because that person can\u2019t abide by those boundaries? At what point do you stop reprimanding your partner and respect her enough to end it? Maybe this partnership is never going to work.", "My partner and I have a nacho approach, although I had never heard the term before.\n\nMy kids have a dad and they don\u2019t need another one.  They do benefit from adults who have their best interests in mind, so that\u2019s my partners role.  He wants what\u2019s best for them, and that includes letting me do the parenting (and co-parenting with their dad). \n\nWe also have the rule that everyone deserves to be respected and he\u2019s allowed to enforce other house rules like \u201cdon\u2019t jump on the furniture\u201d and \u201cgo to bed on time\u201d.  But it\u2019s not heavy handed and if they were to refuse to listen to him, I would be the one to hand out the consequences.  He just does gentle reminders.  \n\nHe does help with the housework and errands and will pick up the kids for me when needed.  But everyone is very clear that I\u2019m the parent, they\u2019re the kids and his job is to support me and by extension, them.", "I understand your POV but why so many partners of people with kids are eager to be parents. Why not just friends with the kids? My partners daughters were adults when we met, so I've never been in a situation to live in the same household with them but just can't imagine a reason to deliberately do more work or take more obligations than necessary. I would just enjoy my life and be friendly with the children, and would do something more only if asked.", "To be fair, 99% of the study sessions I did in high school and college eventually devolved into hangouts. \n\nBut I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s one of the points of having them in the first place. You get to know your classmates and forms bonds with people that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t have talked to. \n\nSchool isn\u2019t just about learning facts, it\u2019s also about learning how to be a person and function in society.", "Do you know how to read?"]}
