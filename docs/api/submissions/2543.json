A lot of people may not like that but this is just what me and my daughter are comfortable with, what me and her have discussed before I engaged and allowed her to move in.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t sprung up on my fianc\u00e9e either, she was told this way before we got together, dated or engaged so this wasn\u2019t new, I told her that I get if she doesn\u2019t like that but this is the boundary that I make for me and my daughter. \n\nShe seemed to be understanding of that when she was told before. Look up NACHO parenting if you\u2019d like. Again I have no issue with someone not liking this, never have been, I have an issue with her randomly having an issue with it even though she was made aware. \n\nShe moved in a few months ago. It started off with her taking her to school, I had no intention of her taking my daughter to school or thinking she was going to do this, but she got up one hour earlier to bring my daughter to school. \n\nNow she ended up going to my daughter and telling her that she wasn\u2019t allowed to go out because she has to do her homework, this ended in an argument between them because my daughter was trying to get a word in and she was cutting her off saying just saying nope you can\u2019t go out. \n\nOnce I walked in I told her that she\u2019s not going to a hangout, she\u2019s going to a library because of a test she has and she will study on that in a group her teacher made for her. \n\nShe looked shocked and said \u201cwell she doesn\u2019t need to be going out like that anyway she won\u2019t focus in a group\u201d I said that that\u2019s not her decision to make.  \n\nI drove Kylie and came back to my fianc\u00e9e fuming, she said that I completely embarrassed her, and that she\u2019s probably not even studying. \n\nI was upset and said that again she has no right to try and dictate what my daughter does, and if there is such a serious concern come to me about it, but she doesn\u2019t get to argue with my kid like that. \n\nShe said \u201coh well I can drop her off and pick her up from school and do all the inconvenient things but when it comes it discipline she can\u2019t?\u201d \n\nI said no, and she needed to stop thinking she can show me she can parent , it\u2019s not about being a parent that wasn\u2019t the issue, she was told before this this boundary we had and it\u2019s not something she can just slowly break down, I said that she did that by choice and went out of her way to make sure I *couldnt* say anything until after, and that was her choice. \n\nShe left saying she was to mad to talk right now, \n\nI feel like I\u2019m being set up in a way.

However, this whole situation comes off as SUPER controlling behavior from her part.", "NTA.  You set a hard and fast boundary and she violated it.  And then violated it again.\n\nAnd then got mad at you for calling her on it.\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 can't get this straight in her head, then you may need to make some hard choices about what kind of future your relationship has.", "NTA\n\nyou told her she wasn't looking for a mum, she is definitely behaving like one which is weird", "NTA.

That course doesn't end well for anyone involved.", "NTA I would rethink living together right now & postpone any thoughts of marriage until your daughter is 18 and off to college. Even if your daughter has gotten in trouble, has poor grades & is a delinquent your fianc\u00e9e should have discussed things with you before trying to control your daughter. She is totally in the wrong here & you need to be concerned about her controlling & abusive attitude toward your daughter.", "NTA - you set up boundaries which she accepted and she has to respect them. Sounds like she has issues trying to control other people and thinks your daughter is the ideal victim to do that.", "NTA. I don't actually see where this was about discipline; Kylie had plans to go out and there's nothing to suggest she'd been badly behaved and shouldn't be allowed to go out.\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9e wants Kylie to respect her, not talking over her would be a good place to start.", "NTA. Single mom here, and I get it. She ISN'T your daughter's parent, period. You made your boundary clear in the beginning and she indicated that she understood. It's not your fault she's trying to flip things around now. She can either deal or go, your daughter's comfort comes first.

You told your fiancee about the nacho parenting.  She isn't stepping back to let you handle it.  It's good to find out now if fiancee is capable of stepping back or not.  She may be such a control freak that she feels compelled to parent.  Maybe let her know that it isn't because you have a lack of confidence in her ability to parent.  It is the style of parenting that you and your daughter have chosen.", "Kid is way past \u201cneeding\u201d a mom. Nta", "NTA\n\nI applaud you for thinking about your daughter first.

This whole \u201cshe does it in a way that I can\u2019t say anything until after the fact\u201d is a BS argument - all it takes is \u201cI rather you not drive her to school anymore\u201d. \u201cI rather you do not pick her up from school anymore\u201d. \u201cI rather that you direct her to me when she asks for a ride going forward\u201d. \u201cI rather that you not clean up after her, she\u2019s 16 and will do it on her own\u201d. Consistently. All in all you should really wait until your daughter is out of the house to continue this relationship, but if that\u2019s not a realistic possibility for you as a pair, then you have to stand your ground every time, not only when it\u2019s a disservice to you or your daughter.", "NTA since you were clear about your boundaries.

If you want to keep that attitude fine. But stop taking advantage of the plus side of having other adult around and then throwing a fit when it doesn\u2019t fit the narrative you want!  Also pretty clear your daughter are pitting you to against each and  it is working beautifully for her.", "[deleted]", "ESH.\n\nImagine living with a kid and them acting out. Potentially smashing things or doing something that requires corrective action, but not being able to do so. \n\nBoundaries were made clear, so I get that you aren't fully an asshole, but this seems like it would strain the relationship between your fiance and child, because the fiance is unable to act like a parent to your child, for good and bad parts. And in return if your child truly acted out, your fiance would just have to sit there and deal until you decided to correct the action. These are a lot of \"what if\" scenarios though. \n\nYour fiance is an asshole for overstepping your boundaries and also trying to keep your child from the group study, but honestly at that age, she's right, kids don't study. At least at my school we never did in a group environment. \n\nIf you two were to have a child together, would your fiance be able to parents then? Because what if she favors the biological child over the child she could never parent? I don't know, this just seems like a overall hard situation. Good luck my friend and I hope the outcome that occurs is one that you are satisfied with!", "I was going to say NTA but I think it should actually be ESH.\n\nFianc\u00e9e sucks for massively overstepping with restricting Kylie\u2019s movements - assuming though that Kylie wasn\u2019t going out alone late at night, suspected drug use etc. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot that\u2019s not included in this post however about what you expected the relationship between Kylie and Fianc\u00e9e was supposed to be. Are they roommates?? Doesn\u2019t seem reasonable considering the fact that she is your fianc\u00e9e and an adult. She has to have some authority here. It feels like you both need to communicate the nuances of those boundaries and what is and what is not allowed considering you are living together and presumably will be in this situation for at least 3 more years.\n\nEdit: Kylie going out late at night could be an issue because she is a minor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But thanks", "You're hyper fixating on a detail while completely ignoring the fact that op had clearly set up boundaries several times but the fiance chose to cross them and expect op to accept the \"help\" he never asked for.", "It doesn\u2019t seem like he accepted it.
