And do it, even if it means staying at a hotel. Nobody could possibly want to get sick", "NTA.  Being sick at Christmas sucks....but viruses are not gifts to pass onto others.", "NTA. I don't see the point of this drama. They said whatever you are comfortable with. They are coming to see you in January. They have a virus you don't want to risk catching, as it would seriously mess with your logistics. You are comfortable with NOT seeing them at Christmas. This is where this discussion should end. The other drama, though, is that you came all this way to visit your mother and spend Christmas with her, but she wants to ditch you on Christmas and go see your sister's diseased family, not caring that she might hand-deliver the virus back to your family. Here, it sounds like some long-running sibling-rivalry/mommy's-favorites drama.", "NTA. Post-COVID people have gotten much more aware (and rational) about how diseases are transmitted.  You have every right to decline to have them over, and they should respect your decision without pushback. That said, it's your mom's house, so I think she gets to weigh in. If she wanted them over you might want to find a hotel.", "NTA\n\nevery time i have flown in the past two years i have without fail gotten sick upon my return and lost another week. pretty likely you will get sick regardless. no reason to up your chances when your sister _knows_ her kids are already sick. and the fact that she and her husband \u2018haven\u2019t gotten\u2019 it yet just means they are probably contagious now.", "NTA but it's not really your choice as it isn't your house. Your mother would have to make the final decision.", "Smart siblings would just understand and ask mom to come over after you and your brother left. By the way, it's a policy here that children with a stomach bug are allowed to come back to school / daycare after having NO symptoms for 48 hours (2 full days). I wonder why... \ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd14", "NTA - I can\u2019t believe grown adults still can\u2019t grasp how viruses are spread.", "NTA. All you\u2019re doing is setting a (fairly reasonable) boundary. In any case, you\u2019re staying at your mom\u2019s house for the time being, so wouldn\u2019t her say be final?", "NTA. youre setting a boundary", "Considering how my coworkers with kids all keep getting sick from their kids and making my other coworkers sick, I would say NTA and that you are justified for wanting to expose yourself and your very young children to whatever their kids have. You didn\u2019t mention if they went to a doctor, but there\u2019s nothing reassuring in what you\u2019ve said so far that says you *can\u2019t* get whatever they have.", "NTA but not your house so ultimately not up to you. I would tell your mom that if they show up you're not interested in interacting though. Stomach bugs suck and your sister should understand you don't want your family sick", "NTA, start looking for a hotel. I would never want to risk getting someone else sick, especially if they are traveling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don\u2019t get to dictate what your mother does or who comes and goes from her home.", "NTA.  People have so little understanding of viruses and, in the case of stomach viruses, just how long the germ lingers on surfaces.  Look up norovirus.  Gross.  \n\nExpecting you to expose yourself and your kids is ignorant and selfish.  Full-stop.", "NTA. This is when you draw a line and do not cross it.  Either:\n\n1) sister and family keep their family at home\n\n2) or you go to a hotel until you leave (and do not see your mom and family)\n\n3) or you get return flight tickets asap and avoid all of those germ-bags", "Nta did she learn literally nothig from Covid?  You keep your sick ass home and don't spread it!", "Ding ding ding. My sister is the oldest and is used to getting her way. I have another brother who has a newborn that is on my side and has said if she comes over he won\u2019t be coming for Christmas, and now my sister is still upset her kids won\u2019t be able to have Christmas with my mom. Fun family drama for sure", "The kids have already been symptom free for two days.", "My mom is also disappointed and wants to visit them on Christmas, and now we are getting flack for telling her not to go over there", "Their oldest threw up on the 21st and was the last to get sick. Parents haven\u2019t had it yet", "Agreed, I told her our stance, if she goes over to see them we will be leaving her house and will stay at a hotel until we leave. Not ideal but willing to go through the complexities of it if it comes down to it", "Fun indeed. Good luck to you and your brother setting boundaries with your sister, sounds like a lifelong project, never a dull moment.", "i personally would cancell the airline tickets and get credits and stay home for christmas.  your family other than your brother dont sound intelligent when it comes to viruses and how it can affect ppl.  stupid ppl can be dangerous for sure", "The general rule is 48 hours symptom free to return to usual activities.  So if the last symptoms were two days ago and no one else gets sick, they are fine to come over on Christmas.", "Understood, the other complicated factor is we recently had a stomach virus affect our household after a Friendsgiving where someone brought their child after they were symptom free of stomach virus for 48h and nearly everyone who went to the Friendsgiving got the stomach bug.", "You don\u2019t actually know you all caught it from the kid.  Stomach viruses can be contagious before the person is showing any symptoms, so it\u2019s just as likely one of the people who developed symptoms after the Friendsgiving spread it to everyone else n", "Speaking as someone who has spent the ENTIRE month of December sick after picking up a virus from family on Thanksgiving, you are NTA. Either stay home or stay in a hotel while visiting.

The best course would be your sister seeing a doctor and seeing if the kids are even contagious.", "We just had the stomach bug rip through our house. Started with my son, then me, next son, my DIL and granddaughter. It was literally 24 hours from start to finish. Or so we thought. It took a few days to get over the fatigue. \nI was supposed to travel to see my oldest but he got the flu. I'm high risk so we are rescheduling. It sucks but not worth the risk. \nNTA but your sister is.", "YTA. You are not setting boundaries when you are stopping your mom to visit her daughter\u2019s place.
