She is very sharp, uncaring, domineering, unpleasant, demanding and emotionally abusive. This is well understood within her family, and has been for years.\n\nMy partner is her only child. His father sadly passed away 5 years ago. Whilst I deeply sympathise with her loss, his mother was apparently just the same before he died.\n\nSince his dad passed away, my fella has done a lot for his mother - despite her bad treatment of him - but has done so out of duty and to try to prevent her abuse rather than from any place of actually enjoying her company, or wanting to do nice things for her.  \n\nFor Christmas, my parents invited her to their house, to join us whilst partner & I cooked dinner for everyone (my mum has 2 types of Dementia and is in a wheelchair - I don't know how many Christmasses I have left with her). \n\nMIL didn't thank them for their hospitality. The next time. I saw her, she reeled off a list of things she evidently spent Christmas day judging about my parents & their home - saying perhaps my mum could walk if the house wasn't 'so cluttered'. That my father is obviously failing as her carer and that he and I are letting her down by not using social services (which is all set up and ready to go, should my mum & dad need/want it in future,  but they are both happy & coping as things are). That my mum is wrong/lazy to remain in bed a lot of the time (despite this being a-the most comfortable thing for her and b- on the advice of her doctors.\n\nI politely thanked her for her concern, explained the situations at hand and tried to change the subject. She carried on about it in a nasty way, so I left our house to run an errand to calm down.\n\nWhen I returned, she was waiting with a furious look - she had been having a go at my partner whilst I was gone. He stood up for me and my folks - and she told him that 'I knew this would happen. You having a child with her is a big hole you have dug yourself. I knew it would break you'.\n\nHe then left (I don't blame him at all!) and she started having a go at me. She said some dreadful things. I am 7 months pregnant and recovering from pneumonia,and she had me so upset that I was struggling to breathe. I politely and repeatedly asked her to leave our house and she wouldn't. \n\nLater that evening, I started bleeding. It carried on into the next day. I was terrified that I would go into premature labour, and scared for the health of my unborn son.\n\nHis family have been dragged into it by MIL and are leaning on us to reconcile. I have no issue with this for the sake of my partner, because he is the one who will cop the most shit if we don't acquiesce - but I am terrified about the effect any more stress will have on his and my mental health, and on the health of our baby and me.\n \n\nAITA for not just rolling over 'for a quiet life'?", "created_utc": 1672622711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100zgnh/aita_my_mil_described_me_and_my_unborn_child_as_a/", "score": 450, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
