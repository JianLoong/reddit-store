It came to be that she passed away suddenly - I found out because I knew enough about her RL to find her obituary quickly. Initially, I was not able to contact her surviving relatives, but wound up heading up efforts to let the community know and share in her memory. Eventually another friend got a hold of her mother via FB and she got into contact with me. Her answer to my questions surprised me - she wanted to know everything she could. Even though she really had no idea about video games, her online community or the rest of it, she wanted to know about the things that made her daughter happy, that she was passionate about and spent her time on. I was frankly surprised, and had worried it wouldn't be my place to speak to her.

I didn\u2019t want to accidentally upset anyone so a little \u201cfyi, up to you if you want to read this\u201d is such a good (and simple, don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t cross my mind) idea", "Especially if you have pictures! They may not have seen them all....", "Thank you! This is my concern, I would never want to inadvertently upset them.", "I suspect your husband doesn\u2019t want you to write the letter because he thinks it will make the parents sad when they read it because they\u2019ll be reminded that their daughter died. Except I guarantee you that they are acutely aware of this fact every day and they are already sad about it. A letter reminding them of all her great qualities and the positive impact that she made on you while she was here is not going to add to their sadness. I\u2019d write the letter.", "Your husband is completely, totally, absolutely, and in every imaginable way, ***WRONG!***  People who have lost someone they loved are never unaware of what they have lost, but they do often feel that other people have forgotten; it is never a bad idea to tell a grieving person that you also remember, and grieve. We received many wonderful letters after my father died, and learned about things we hadn't known, and were touched to know that he affected so many lives for the good.\n\nPlease write that letter. I promise you that her mother will cherish it.", "It sounds really sweet of you. You should include distinctive things/quirks that you remember about her eg she smelled like lavender mixed with oranges or you could tell when she was thinking really hard because she'd look left and absently tap her  foot.\n\nI would also add in a note that they are welcome to contact you if they want and include any photos you have of her. Photos and videos they haven't seen would be a precious addition too. \n\nBut just knowing someone thought well of her to reach out to them parents is lovely.", "one of the many ways to help mend a grieving heart is talking about the person who passed on, im sure the letter will help the family heal", "Just to echo everyone else..... please send that letter.  When my grandmother passed away, I was supposed to ride with my immediate family in the car procession after the hearse to the church, but I felt so sick when I woke up that I ended up having to stay at the hotel and get a taxi when I felt better.  Because of this, I actually managed to get to the church before anyone else was there; it was just me, the church choir, and my hollow, endless grief.  \n\n\nNow, my grandmother was a member of that church choir for decades, and every member took a moment out of their warmup to come to me, individually, and tell me how lucky they all felt to have known her.  Even the one women who had joined the choir just a month or two before my grandmother was hospitalized told me that my grandmother was the warmest, most welcoming person that she had ever met.  \n\n\nWhen I miss my grandmother now, I think of all of those people who knew her, miss her, and loved her--for decades, or for just a month.  I treasure the memories of what they said to me, so I can only imagine how wonderful it would be to have something physical like a letter for her parents to hold and bring out to read when they want to remember how much their daughter was loved and how many lives she touched.", "If you want to play it super safe, put the letter in a sealed envelope and put an explanation and that envelope inside a mailing envelope.", "omg good point. They would adore seeing some new pictures!", "How many people lose someone and then hate that no-one talks about them for fear of them being upset? These are all good things OP wants to say, there's no downside here. If they're not ready for mail they just won't open it.", "This is such a thoughtful way to approach this"]}
