Its my job to register grad students for classes and advise them until they pick their doctoral advisor. I recently had a first year student who did not maintain the 3.0 gpa requirement after two semesters, and was therefore academically dismissed by the university. She claimed she nearly lost her life in a car accident and is still traumatized by it, she even saw two other people get killed instead. This apparently happened during her first semester. There apparently was a hearing where this student had to testify in front of a judge (and in front of the teenager that almost took her out) about what happened that night. She did send me her court subpoena and let me know right after it happened. She was already on academic probation after her first semester (when the accident apparently happened), so the fact that she let it continue into her second semester is a bit concerning. anyways once she was dismissed, she sent me an email asking if there was any way she could be reinstated. I told her no, and explained that I could no longer help her. I suggested she just take it easy for a few days, eat a bag of chips, and that peace be with her. Well four days later, I get an email from the dean, explaining that she would be medically dropping two classes and that we need to reinstate her. The chair wasn't thrilled either, so we tried to convince her to change programs, but the girl wouldn't budge, claiming she just had a \"bad year.\" AITA for trying to get her to look at better options? I just dont feel shes cut out for this program.", "created_utc": 1689774993, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153vs0n/aita_for_reinforcing_departmental_boundaries_with/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The kind of trauma she experienced doesn\u2019t magically go away after a single semester. You showed no empathy, no compassion, no kindness.", "YTA jfc this poor student went through hell and you\u2019re like \u201cshe claims that\u201d something happened to her that\u2019s she\u2019s literally sent you proof *did* happen to her, and you dismissed her academic ambitions with \u201ceat a bag of chips and go away\u201d. You sound like such a piece of work.", "Relax and eat a bag of chips? Seriously?! YTA for that alone. You don\u2019t care about this student\u2019s well-being, you wanted her out of your hair.", "Yta\n\nNo compassion for someone going through trauma", "Jesus, You don't have any empathy, do you? It's sad the student had to go over your head to get the correct thing done and be given the rights and accommodations they are allowed to have. PTSD is a very real condition and YTA for not recognizing that. People have shit that happens in their life that causes them to focus on other things. I failed out of my first EE program because my marriage was falling apart while I was trying to do it and work full time. Later I tried to get back into that school and they said no so I went to a new school and graduated with a 4.0. Cut the girl some slack she just watched 2 people die.", "YTA for not using a process that ensured everyone up through the dean was on board with the handling of this student. While you may be right for her ability to meet program requirements, it's clear she had significant and verifiable events in her life that were playing a role. Your handling of this was off, including the frankly random, odd, and inappropriate guidance to 'eat a bag of chips' (what?!). You also allude in this post to distrust or disbelief in this student which is probably not the right mindset for you to have.", "YTA - You didn't try to get her to look at better options. You told her to eat chips. \n\nDid it never occur to you when your student was dealing with this horrific experience that it was your job to connect her with the appropriate resources at the university? Did it never occur to you to discuss this situation with the dean? Did you make any attempts to advocate for this student at all? \n\nIf the university wanted a robot to do your job, they wouldn't be paying you to do it. They hired a human because they wanted someone who would actually think and care about the students they are responsible for advising. \n\nIf you are so jaded and burnt out by your profession that you completely lack empathy, then you should not be working with students. You should seriously consider therapy.", "YTA. I work at a university and you clearly don't understand what your job is. You are supposed to support the students, not kick them while they are down, and you should have supported them immediately after the incident. I would be advising the student to contact the ombudsman and lodge a complaint about your department.", "YTA - you didn't do your job. You failed to assist this student through her real trauma and make sure that she was on-track. \n\nThe Dean should see you removed from your position for cause, as it is clear that you not only aren't doing your job, but that you are acting like a complete asshole to the students ('eat a bag of chips' -- wtf!!!)", "YTA\n\nEat a bag of chips and deal with the ruling", ">I suggested she just take it easy for a few days, eat a bag of chips, and that peace be with her.\n\nlmao please be so thankful that you've never experienced a trauma. \n\nYTA and don't deserve to be in your job position.

The way you wrote this, it seems like you don't even believe this accident happened.  Eat a bag of chips and actually do your job of helping students.", "YTA- you\u2019re not even human anymore at this point", "YTA\n\nIs this a joke post? I know it's a stereotype of STEM (I'm in it too) to be devoid of empathy and focus only the science but this is beyond the pale. If she's not cut out for the program that's fine, but you have been completely unprofessional and shockingly heartless. You say 'apparently happened' multiple times re: the accident despite her giving you court evidence, do you not believe that an accident happened? Do you not believe that someone in a deadly car crash would experience trauma from it or that trauma could be a legitimate reason for academic underperformance?\n\nShe's clearly working hard to reinstate herself, this is something that matters to her. Your dean seems to see her cause as legitimate, why don't you?\n\nEven if she was a lazy, unintelligent student who was dropped for no reason other their own incompetence, responding to someone asking about being reinstated with \"eat a bag of chips and peace be with you\" is unbelievably rude and condescending and you'd be TA for that comment alone.", "YTA, a typical bureaucrat who cannot see beyond their remit of ticking boxes, like that makes you good at your job, frankly l am disgusted by your lack of compassion and basic humanity, the fact that the dean emailed you to reinstate her shows you clearly do not understand anything outside of your little fiefdom.", "YTA- with how callously you push off the fact that she watched 2 people DIE in front of her and then needed to relive it in front of the asshole who did it and then have the defense's attorney  most likely attacking her to try and discredit her account was also another horrible trauma and your advice is to eat a bag of chips... the lack of empathy or even any sympathy is truly horrible", "YTA and your attitude is the reason why higher education is the mess that it is now. The student supplied court record explaining what happened. Your DEAN is telling you it was a bad call and you're still not seeing why you're wrong? You're an advisor not some grand protector of the realm. If this student wants to tank their time & money by continuing in a program they're not prepared for, what's your issue? It doesn't negatively affect your department or position. This feels like a power trip more than anything.", "YTA. She saw two 'other people' (were these her friends, people in the same car or random people) killed in front of her and they likely died horribly, she had to testify against the asshole who killed them which not only will bring up a huge amount of terrible memories but be hard in and of itself to stand up to someone, to be in front of strangers recounting the worst moment of your life, etc.\n\nYou think it's concerning she 'let it continue' into the second semester. Yeah get over horrific trauma instantly you lazy asshole student, just get over it.  Try to have just the tiniest bit of empathy for other people in life.\n\n>claiming she just had a \"bad year.\"\n\nIf someone fucked up a year of college because they were a bit homesick or broke up with their boyfriend that is one thing, their bad year is witnessing a horrific accident, probably struggling to travel around due to anxiety/fear of being in a car again and probably survivor guilt.", "**I suggested she just take it easy for a few days, eat a bag of chips, and that peace be with her.**\n\nSorry, but What the What?  How did your dean let such an unprofessional response go unchallenged?\n\nYTA here.", "Eat a bag of chips? YTA.", "I was N T A until you told her to eat a bag of chips.  It is not your job to tell her how to deal with her trauma.  You were unprofessional.  YTA.", "YTA, she just went through major trauma. Give her a chance. \n\nAlso, what's the worst that can happen for you personally if she wouldn't make it?", "YTA. This is a one time event that has severely affected her. Everyone had adversity happen. It's not like she was just flaking off. She needed time to recover and University doesn't exactly allow you to stop in the middle of a semester.", "YTA - I work for a university and the culture here is that staff works hard to see that students finish their course of study. Everyone, including staff whose job isn't direct student contact (e.g. custodial) everyone is told about the various \"success centers\" where students can get help overcoming their individual obstacles.\n\nYour student had a temporary disability caused by the accident, referring them to the Student Disability Center, who would have crafted accommodations appropriate to her specific temporary disability, to get her through to her degree, would have been the right action. Instead you cranked the paperwork and didn't refer her to anyone. It's good that someone, somewhere set her to the right people to get the right thing done.\n\nIts not enough to crank the university's paperwork machine, its the job of staff to know that there are other cranks available and send student to those who can turn the appropriate cranks.", "YTA. You cannot make a judgement on whether she's 'cut out' for this program; given what she's been through, she has not had the opportunity to show what she is capable of. The way you dismiss her trauma is really concerning. I work in a University and, being completely honest, you're damn lucky that a) you are not under fire for discrimination and b) you haven't BEEN fired for your utterly callous behaviour. \n\n'she sent me an email asking if there was any way she could be reinstated. I told her no, and explained that I could no longer help her.'\n\nI mean, given the Dean's intervention this simply wasn't true. And are you honestly trying to tell us all that you have no mitigating circumstances process? No appeals processes? Baloney. \n\n'I suggested she just take it easy for a few days, eat a bag of chips, and that peace be with her.'\n\nThis is outrageous. I genuinely hope you're trolling.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s called \u201cempathy\u201d, and as a trusted(?) advisor to students, you need to look up the definition and start practicing this in your job. \u201cEat a bag of chips.\u201d Just fucking wow!", "YTA. She went through trauma that affected her studies and you think the problem is she's not a good fit? \n\nI'm glad she went to the Dean.", "YTA, YTA, YTA. Does your university not provide you with any training on trauma and how to address the impact? Are you really so ill equipped to understand or provide even a modicum of grace in this situation?  How in the world are you qualified to advise graduate students when you are this clueless to basic human behavior?", "YTA and a failure as a human being. You must really hate your job and your students to behave with such indifference to genuine trauma.", "YTA in this situation.", "YTA. Doesn\u2019t matter if she was already doing poorly just before the accident. She clearly experienced a near death situation where she witnessed people die. I don\u2019t think you understand how unbelievably traumatic that is.  Not allowing her the opportunity to take a break to be reinstated later is not just inappropriate but cruel. \n\nAnd by the way, telling to take a few days and eat a bag of chips? Is that really a normal response to someone who has witnessed people DIE?", "YTA. The person who should be dismissed is you. Not only were you insensitive, you also lied to this student. You told her nothing less could be done but clearly that wasn\u2019t the case since the dean saw fit to reinstate her. You\u2019re trying to convince her that she\u2019s not a good fit for this program but you\u2019re not a good fit for your job. She didn\u2019t meant the standards of the program because she was suffering from a trauma, but what\u2019s your excuse for not meeting the standards of your position? You need to start advising this student properly or you\u2019ll find yourself out of a job.", "YTA. This is not your calling, not if this is how you treat a student with severe trauma. I shudder to think what else you\u2019ve done when not pulled up on your actions. The Dean should be investigating you to be honest, because you\u2019re in a position where you\u2019re trusted to help people and you clearly haven\u2019t the capacity for objectivity or empathy.", "Holy shit, YTA. This girl nearly lost her life, watched two of her friends die and had to deal with a whole court case afterwards. That's traumatic as hell. \n\nBut here you are telling her shes \"not cut out for the program\" because she didn't overcome this in less than a year? Any respectable school has regulations where due to personal circumstances you don't get kicked out and get a second chance and this was a perfect example of that.", "YTA-for someone who works in/ around academics, you think you\u2019d understand one needs to use paragraphs, even when one is being a callous AH.", "YTA. Your job SHOULD require empathy and understanding, and you do not. Honestly, you should be let go. But do yourself a favor.
