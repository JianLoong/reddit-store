My boyfriend suggested that I get an outside perspective here.\n\nI (26F) was dating \u201cJames\u201d (M26) for most of college and we had plans to get engaged after graduation. Two months before graduation, I caught him planning to cheat.  Nothing physical seemed to have happened yet, but he and another girl were making plans for a weekend that he told me he was going for a quick visit home. Cheating is an instant dealbreaker to me, so it was over. Instead of having a fight, I didn\u2019t say anything, just waited til after he left for \u201chome\u201d, texted him proof that I had caught him and \u201cgood thing you\u2019re single now, have fun\u201d, then blocked him on everything and went for a girls weekend with friends. James lost his shit and spent a month trying to get in contact with me or guilt friends into helping him. The few messages that got through I trashed without even reading them. After awhile, I thought he had finally given up.\n\nAbout a year later, my sister (24F) announces she wants to bring her boyfriend home to meet the family. We didn\u2019t realize she had a boyfriend, but my parents had a BBQ and told her to bring him. It was James. My parents were stunned but tried to pull it together.  I just left. My sister called and tried to explain later that they had met at a party on campus and it was no big deal since I broke up with him. I told her I thought she could do better, but she could make her own mistakes. I just wouldn\u2019t be spending time around them. She got mad about it, because our parents \u201ctook my side\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t get along with my sister at the best of times, so avoiding them wasn\u2019t hard except at holidays. My parents caved and let him come to Thanksgiving and Christmas since they seemed serious. James seemed way too invested in getting back on my good side when he was around and it apparently made my sister jealous, because she started acting brattier than normal. This last weekend was a milestone birthday for my mom and I thought it would be a good chance to introduce them to my boyfriend Todd (29M). Mom gave it the ok and Todd actually made a great impression on the family. James was there with my sister and he was pissed and left early. My sister called me later and yelled at me for upsetting James and trying to make him jealous to get his attention. I told her that she knew she was getting a cheat when she decided to date my sloppy seconds and he was no longer my problem.\n\nSince then she\u2019s blown up social media venting about it and is refusing to see my parents for the holidays if Todd and I are there. My parents think she\u2019s over the top and acting out but she\u2019s on their case so much they want me to try and smooth it over and apologize for calling him sloppy seconds.

Your sister refuses to accept that not only did she get your cast-off, he's also not worth the drama and issues this has brought in the family.\nIf she's angry at you instead of with him because he got jealous then she's being ridiculous, and apologizing for it isn't gonna make her see sense.", "NTA\n\nIt was an apt description and the reasonable reaction to a grown ass adult throwing a tantrum over the consequences of their actions is to tell them why they're acting like a moron. You did what anyone should, which is to stand your ground and not let yourself be yelled at for someone else's poor life choices. If she's insecure, she shouldn't start shit that will get her called out. And while it's probable that James has been messing with your sister, under the circumstances (a poor relationship and him likely well poisoning against you) there likely isn't much you can personally do to fix it.\n\nAs far as your parents are concerned...yeah, they're in an uncomfortable situation. But that is not your problem and their desire to play peacekeeper is pretty messed up in the circumstances. Depending on your relationship I would suggest mentioning to them that you are legitimately concerned for your sister's wellbeing but aren't in a position to do much, that you have no desire to push her out of the family and love her, but that you've made your stance on this entire thing very clear and you aren't going to retract a true statement because their grown child is throwing a tantrum. Then I would ask them if they really want this to be the rest of their lives, with her acting like a child and them trying to smooth things over when they know she's in the wrong, or if they're going to do their job as her parents and show her that this is a bad situation, she's doing it to herself, and her actions have consequences.", "NTA \n\n>apologize for calling him sloppy seconds\n\nOk!

What exactly was she expecting - that you would stay single for the rest of your life?   You are simply living your life and your life now includes your boyfriend, just as her life includes her boyfriend.  She really wanted you to be miserable seeing her with your ex but you moved on, clearly the ex hasn't.\n\nNTA", ">My sister called me later and yelled at me for upsetting James and trying to make him jealous to get his attention. \n\nWell, James shouldn't be getting jealous because he's dating OP's sister.
