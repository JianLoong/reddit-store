Two months before graduation, I caught him planning to cheat.  Nothing physical seemed to have happened yet, but he and another girl were making plans for a weekend that he told me he was going for a quick visit home. Cheating is an instant dealbreaker to me, so it was over. Instead of having a fight, I didn\u2019t say anything, just waited til after he left for \u201chome\u201d, texted him proof that I had caught him and \u201cgood thing you\u2019re single now, have fun\u201d, then blocked him on everything and went for a girls weekend with friends. James lost his shit and spent a month trying to get in contact with me or guilt friends into helping him. The few messages that got through I trashed without even reading them. After awhile, I thought he had finally given up.\n\nAbout a year later, my sister (24F) announces she wants to bring her boyfriend home to meet the family. We didn\u2019t realize she had a boyfriend, but my parents had a BBQ and told her to bring him. It was James. My parents were stunned but tried to pull it together.  I just left. My sister called and tried to explain later that they had met at a party on campus and it was no big deal since I broke up with him. I told her I thought she could do better, but she could make her own mistakes. I just wouldn\u2019t be spending time around them. She got mad about it, because our parents \u201ctook my side\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t get along with my sister at the best of times, so avoiding them wasn\u2019t hard except at holidays. My parents caved and let him come to Thanksgiving and Christmas since they seemed serious. James seemed way too invested in getting back on my good side when he was around and it apparently made my sister jealous, because she started acting brattier than normal. This last weekend was a milestone birthday for my mom and I thought it would be a good chance to introduce them to my boyfriend Todd (29M). Mom gave it the ok and Todd actually made a great impression on the family. James was there with my sister and he was pissed and left early. My sister called me later and yelled at me for upsetting James and trying to make him jealous to get his attention. I told her that she knew she was getting a cheat when she decided to date my sloppy seconds and he was no longer my problem.\n\nSince then she\u2019s blown up social media venting about it and is refusing to see my parents for the holidays if Todd and I are there.

But I do genuinely Haye the term sloppy seconds. It's gross and dehumanizing, and it aims at the wrong thing. There's an implication that the ex is in somehow used up or less than a person for having a relationship that didn't work out. And you're also judging the new partner for having stooped so low as to.... date someone whose had previous relationships?\n\n Now when it's because they did a dirtbag thing, by all means call them a dirtbag. Call them a cheater if they cheated. Judge them for the thing they actually did wrong, there's much more room for witty insults and villifying the behavior is much more effective than demonizing the person.\n\nWe're all someone's sloppy seconds. We're all dating someone's else's cast offs. The entire relationship market is a second-hand store where we're all trying to find value in things that have seen some life and hope that someone sees value in us.

She fits the profile of someone that had an adverse childhood, this could have a profound effect on her physical and emotional development. \n\nI don\u2019t know the best way to handle this situation. James is definitely using her, and she\u2019s already feeling marginalized and isolated. James should absolutely never be allowed to anything family related because he\u2019s a cheater. That should be made clear over and over again. \u201cWe love you and want to see you with a more stable partner.\u201d \n\nHmm. I guess in that case, maybe you could apologize for the way you worded your response to her accusation? Show your sister the respect she isn\u2019t showing herself. And definitely your parents can ban James from family gatherings going forward. Something like, \u201cWe love you and want to see you with a stable partner. James has disgraced himself and shown all of us that he\u2019s untrustworthy. We\u2019re very worried he\u2019s taking advantage of you, but we understand that we have to respect your choices.

Either way, it\u2019s clear James is hurting your sister and that she\u2019s extremely vulnerable.

I don\u2019t know what to do about James, but I do know a fair bit about childhood development and family dynamics. She\u2019s definitely crying out for attention because something fundamental was missing from her childhood. It\u2019s not too late to support her. Sorry she\u2019s acting out, interacting with a predator, and trying to bring him back into the family dynamic. That part sucks. I\u2019m sorry James is such a good liar, your sister can\u2019t see it. \n\nBottom line: James knew your sister was vulnerable.

If anything she got more support and attention than I did because she acted out so much and was behind on academics so she got extra tutoring and counseling. To hear her tell it, everyone was mean to her all the time, which just isn\u2019t true, we had a really normal and unremarkable childhood. She never was able to keep friends because she always drove them away over really petty things and eventually most people at school just didn\u2019t want the drama. We didn\u2019t get along because she was constantly trying to pick fights and out compete me when there was really nothing to compete over. For some reason, she seems to interpret not being the center of attention or the \u201cmain character\u201d as people being mean to her. She\u2019s been like that for as long as I can remember so now that we\u2019re both adults I just avoid her, even before the James issue.
