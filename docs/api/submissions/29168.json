I met her 30 minutes before that. \n\nIt comes up all the damn time, they come over for dinner and I mention I am tired and she will tell me I don\u2019t work so how am I tired. I have talked to her and my son before. My husband and I have concluded that she is jealous. It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense at this point.\n\nI have told her if it happens again I will ask her to leave and the comments stopped for a bit. They were over for a dinner party and I was talking about how I made the pie for tonight.  Beth made a comment that of course I had enough time since I don\u2019t work.\n\nI had enough and told her I had enough. I get that her is jealous of me since she has to work but she needs to get out and she is not welcome back. My son and her called me a jerk for kicking them out.\n\nEdit: Not working doesn\u2019t equal lazy. I am not loafing around the house all day. I get up do all the chores, take care of all the paperwork, go for gym, take the dogs out, make homemade meals everyday, volunteer and so on.\n\nLazy would be chilling in front of the tv all day.

I don't believe in taking the higher road with jerks. \n\nWhat was the point of feminism if women aren't allowed to choose the life they want? \n\nAvoiding her forever is unavoidable.

Walking into your SO\u2019s parents\u2019 home and insulting his mom\u2026 it doesn\u2019t get much worse. Truly horrid person.

Kudos for standing up for yourself. \n\nYour rationale that she\u2019s \u201cjealous\u201d because she \u201chas to work\u201d oozes misogyny. Quite a lot of women enjoy their work.

Because lazy people don't make pies. \n\nShe sounds overworked, and like she doesn't have enough time in the day to do everything she'd like to do. No reason to have a grudge against people who have arranged their lives in a way that allows them to spend their time exactly as they'd like. \n\nAnd if she thinks that paid work is the only thing that can make a person tired, she must live a very dull life.", "When people ask me what I do, I laugh ruefully and say, \"I'm very busy, but none of it pays me a check.

Then you didn't go back on your threat. Good job maintaining your personal borders.\n\nI don't know if Beth is jealous or simply gets off putting other people down or whatever, but her behavior is just really rude and ignorant.

Cooking, chores, paperwork, gym walking the dogs, etc are things people do with a job/career. So yeah it's hard to respect people who chose to not have self fulfilment outside the home.

And as a woman, she is attacking another woman for her life choices?", "NTA- what is the matter with your son that he would tolerate that level of disrespect to his mom?? Especially for so long?

He gets to talk about the vacation but she books everything, does the laundry and mostly packs for him, she does the grocery shopping and they can cook together and eat, on the weekends there aren't a lot of errands so they can enjoy their time together. \n\nI always say I am not jealous of her, I am jealous of HIM!

She hates that I have a college degree and not using it. We have fought about me returning to work many times. I don't plan to. \n\nSounds like your DIL also doesn't understand the value or sacrifices that come from being a housewife. I now laugh it off and don't let it bother me when my mom brings it up.

You need to have a serious conversation with him before they are allowed back into your home.", "NTA\u2026.

Being a SAHW is not all sunshine and roses. After my FIL passed, my MIL was lost for a long time. She's only now able to start enjoying life again. Hopefully your DIL begins to understand that everyone has their own unique circumstances and her jealousy is unwarranted.

Jealousy doesn\u2019t feel like the right fit here.\n\nJealously is typically something one feels towards a peer, someone in the same circumstances as they are, someone they can relate to, etc.\n\nYou & she are in different stages of life. You\u2019ve raised grown children (one of which is her husband), so she\u2019d be aware of the fact that you\u2019re navigating a completely different stage of life than she is now or ever has before. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely that she\u2019d even make any mental comparison between she & you to even begin to feel jealous or any other way about it.\n\nAlso, jealousy is typically manifested in a more range \u201csubjects of attack\u201d (for lack of a better way to say what she insults you about). She is more singularly focused on one thing - the fact that you don\u2019t work.\n\nSo in my opinion, jealousy doesn\u2019t really fit.\n\nI suspect it\u2019s more something along the lines of some kind of fanatical belief regarding work - specifically prejudices towards those that don\u2019t. (Severe prejudices if she can\u2019t even manage to control herself & refrain from making unsolicited, rude, judgmental comments about/to you in your own home where she is a guest - especially at a party where others are present to witness her horrible behavior.)\n\nIt\u2019s telling that you have said neither her nor your son has explained WHY she makes the comments she makes. If it was jealously, I suspect your son would have attempted to explain/excuse away her comments (or even just attempt to mitigate any damage done by them) by saying something regarding jealousy - even just peripherally. Since he didn\u2019t, I suspect it\u2019s something much harder to articulate (without first taking a good long look at oneself).\n\nPrejudice (regardless of what/who the prejudice involves) is something many people have trouble admitting - even to themselves. Admitting prejudice would be admitting that their beliefs, as strong as they might be, aren\u2019t based on facts. Since prejudices are often based in extreme (or fringe) ideologies that are deeply ingrained (oftentimes for years or even an entire lifetime), that can be extremely difficult to admit - even to oneself, much less others.\n\nShe seems to have some fanatical beliefs regarding work that include extreme prejudices towards those who don\u2019t work. If so, she may not even be willing to even entertain that possibility that her beliefs &/or prejudices are anything other than facts. And if she can\u2019t even entertain that possibility privately to herself (or to her husband), she would never explain her comments by admitting to her prejudice.\n\nSo I think she is extremely prejudice towards you because you don\u2019t work - not jealous. If I\u2019m correct, she doesn\u2019t secretly envy you because you don\u2019t work, she disdains you for it. She isn\u2019t jealous that you\u2019re able to stay home, she is disgusted by it.\n\nDo NOT get me wrong - she\u2019s still an AH to be sure (as is your son for not putting a stop to it the first time it happened) & you are NTA. I\u2019m simply stating that I don\u2019t think jealousy is the motivator.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, even if we were to pretend that she is correct & people who stay home are lazy, she\u2019d still be an AH.\n\nWhat right does she have to come into YOUR home & disrespect you with her unsolicited, rude, judgmental comments? You\u2019re not asking your son / her husband to provide you with any resources (monetary or otherwise) to allow you to stay home. So why does she believe she has any right to judge you for what you as a grown ass woman do with your time?", "\"Your wife is not welcome back so long as she cannot keep her opinion about me being a homemaker to herself. There is no excuse for such rudeness, and while I never imagined having this sort of relationship with a DIL, I will not be putting up with her disrespect any longer.
