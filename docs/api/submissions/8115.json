She asks me for my opinion, and being the person I am, I give an honest answer, and she always blows up, deflects and blames everything on me.

She kept yelling, I shut down, then she went on about how I\u2019m being negative, having an attitude and she\u2019s not going to deal with her MOH acting like this at her wedding or bachelorette party, and any other reason she could think to yell at me.

She was LIVID when I told her no because I was planning on eloping in a different country, but that she was welcome to buy a plane ticket if she wanted to come. Then I walked out.  \n\nI texted her saying to completely remove me from her wedding, that she clearly does not want me in it if she\u2019s so quick to tell me that I\u2019m out every other day.

Based on what you've said she is, at a minimum, being a bridezilla AH.\n\nBut just a thought experiment:\n\nLet's assume for a moment that you are actually exaggerating: your sister is not really a narcissist, the reality is that you two just don't get along very well and she's having a stressful time planning the wedding (its stressful at the best of times, I know from experience).\n\nEven in that case... you're *still* NTA. You have no obligation to be your sister's MOH, or to attend her wedding, or to have **any** relationship with her at all.

Is this brand new behavior or has your sister always taken out her frustrations on you or somebody else in the family?\n\nVery rarely can you get somebody to have an epiphany and see your side of a story, it seems, and I'm only making an assumption based on the information here, that whenever your sister is frustrated, stressed or perceives that something's wrong, she totally attacks you and goes off instead of maturely addressing whatever the true issue is. If this is the case, you have to separate behavior from the person and decide what you can and could not tolerate.\n\nI think it's wonderful that you walked away, I'm not sure how that impacts your relationship with your parents or others in the family and you need to be prepared for backlash from them... Your sister is most likely going to tell them some convoluted version of what happened.\n\nYou do not have to engage in conversations with anybody if you don't want to, frankly it might become exhausting trying to explain your side of the story to anybody. I think you did the right thing by pulling out of the wedding and are 100% correct... By removing yourself from the wedding she can only flip out about you for a little while longer and then eventually she's going to have to go off on somebody else.\n\nGood luck and keep us posted", "Nta.

It doesn't seem like your sister has many friends", "NTA, you did the right thing.  You do realize that you are in an abusive relationship, right?

Whenever I visit her, I see her treat her fianc\u00e9 the exact same way.", "This.  NTA.", "This is absolutely the case. I somehow lived with her for a year after college but I barely remember any of it because I just completely blocked it out. All I remember is her screaming at me at the top of her lungs for not acknowledging her when she yelled at me for something she didn\u2019t approve of. These were things like cleaning the litter boxes or not washing the dishes by hand.", "I\u2019ve already had that conversation more than once with my mom. I\u2019m just waiting for the text telling me to stop being mean to my sister. I\u2019m trying to decide if I should just reach out to my mom first and explain my side, but then I know she\u2019ll immediately just start saying it\u2019s all my fault too, and I don\u2019t think I can handle that. I\u2019m already crying because I obviously want to be there for my sister on her special day, and have always wanted her and my mom to be a part of my life, but they will always take each others side in any situation and put all the blame on me, no matter what it is, and then are always shocked by how much they keep pushing me away.", "She was like this way before she got engaged. My mom always takes her side every time so I get attacked by both of them at once. I\u2019ve never been told by my mom that standing up against my sister was justified. I\u2019ve gone very minimal contact with both of them unless they reach out first. \n\nWere from Illinois, but she went to school in Wisconsin. I was living in chicago for school, without a car, so I\u2019d ask her to meet me outside the city to pick me up once or twice a year because she was going that way to get home anyway. It\u2019s been 6 or 7 years and she still holds it over my head that I didn\u2019t pay for any gas or tolls, that she had to pay anyway. But I had to pay for public transportation and waste almost 2 hours to meet her outside the city because she refused to drive downtown, and always paid for food for her and her boyfriend when we stopped.", "She seems to have a lot of friends. She gets invited to 5-10 weddings every year.", "Oof. Poor man.\n\nMaybe your sister will learn something about herself and be better behaved for her next wedding.", "I honestly feel so bad for her future husband, and their future kids. I just keep telling myself that I will do everything in my power to make sure I\u2019m the kind of aunt her kids will be able to turn to because I can only imagine what kind of mom she will be.", "I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s not your fault, and you can\u2019t fix them, or control what they choose to do. Focus on building the life you want and the relationships you deserve.", "Sounds like classic triangulation. Get some therapy or do some reading so you can gain some understanding of their behaviour and what drives it so you can gain some understanding and protect yourself. It sounds like psychologically you\u2019ve already taken a battering, but if you understand the situation it is usually much easier to manage.", "Oof, yeah that's a family dynamic that's so unfair, unfortunately it's not uncommon.\n\nYou deserve better as a daughter and a sister, for whatever reason your mother and sister have a questionable way of interacting with you, you deserve to be cherished and loved, they might love you but they certainly don't treat you well. This is probably much more a reflection of them and their problems then really you. Very often it's much easier to go off on somebody else than to face their own problems, you'll never get an epiphany from these people, in my own experience I found the best way to deal with them is to simply not engage/refuse to fight back and give them any ammunition.\n\nCongratulations on your own upcoming wedding, do what you need to do to protect your mental health with your sister and mother, I do feel pulling out as MOH is the smart move, being in her wedding party is simply being a target for all of her frustrations in life.", "And yet she wanted you to be the MOH. Not trying to be disrespectful and maybe it's a cultural thing, but why wouldn't any of her friends be the MOH? I could speculate as to why she goes to so many weddings but there's not enough info", "Gotta admit, this made me chuckle just a little bit, as mean as that is.", "Bright side, maybe they'll divorce before they have kids.", "Well, the wedding is in 2024. Fianc\u00e9 has a whole year to see the light and run...", "It\u2019s something I\u2019ve had to put up with for about ten years, so I\u2019m honestly used to being the punching bag and know what I do and don\u2019t deserve. It just makes me sad that that they are so full of themselves that they don\u2019t see they\u2019re the ones pushing me away, and instead blame me for being nasty all the time. \n\nAs for my own wedding, I honestly can\u2019t wait. We don\u2019t have anything planned yet, but we know we want to either elope or just have 4-5 of those most important people to us there. But his family is just so accepting of me and make me feel loved and welcomed for the first time ever, and like I actually have a family for once in my life, so it can\u2019t come soon enough.", "Tbh, I don\u2019t think she truly ever wanted me to be her MOH, because I can\u2019t think of any other reason why she would be so willing to strip me of that title every other day. I think it has more to do with making my mom happy and automatically assuming I\u2019m going to make her my MOH. She constantly tells me it\u2019s going to be a spruced college friend instead of me. She\u2019s been to dozens of wedding in the last few years, but not once has she ever been an MOH herself or even a bridesmaid at any of them.", "Glad you at least got a little laugh out of this sad situation.", "Maybe that's the blessing? For whatever reason your own family has pushed you away, but this makes you see how wonderful your fiance and his family are.\n\nUnfortunately, it's a really rare thing for people to change, I was in a very similar situation for over 25 years, with the help of therapy I've learned how to not engage or fight back, removing myself and slowly they've turned on others in the family, people who are willing to fight back. Sometimes I focus on pitying those who attack me, it's obvious there's something hurting within them that makes them lash out... They genuinely convince themselves that the person they're attacking is the one who's wrong. It's not fair and it does hurt so much, but you pick your friends,  you pick your partner and those are people who will cherish you. Congratulations and do everything you want to do for your wedding!", "Well that answers my question. Since she has never even been a bridesmaid and has gone to so many weddings I can assume she's merely an acquaintance/coworker to these people. Or they like the fiance and have to invite her out of necessity. So all in all don't stress on it and let her be.", "NTA\n\nI would go NC for a while just to get some peace and quiet.", "Nta- she\u2019s an adult and adults don\u2019t yell because you have a different personality or opinion.
