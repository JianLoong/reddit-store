It\u2019s off for a teenager to make a decision to change which house he stays at. It seems like there was a significant family breakdown.

They could easily say he's doing good and bring him up without always mentioning how close he is to his girlfriends brothers.", "My husband and Henry were close. They are far less close now. At a certain point Henry started blaming my husband for him not seeing his mom and he said he chose me over his mom. None of this is true. Henry's mom chose to be absent and they were broken up long before I met my husband. But Henry always craved time with his mom that she never wanted with him. I think she was only willing to let him move in with her because of his age. She often missed her scheduled parenting time with him. She missed most of his birthday and Christmas too.\n\nIt's not that we don't want to hear anything positive about Henry. We have engaged in some of the conversations about him. But where we have an issue is in regard to bringing up his posting about the two boys he now claims as his brothers when our son is around. That is incredibly hurtful to our son.", "That's our next step. We were hoping it would be one we would not need to make.", "Step brother aka only related through marriage", "That's how my husband and I feel. We can't understand why they are so okay with reminding Luca of something so hurtful. But they don't seem to care at all what he's feeling and he's just as much their grandson as Henry is. They actually had a better relationship with Luca until this.", "It almost looks like they're doing it on purpose, and I'm disgusted if that's the case", "Why are tbey always bringing in him up in conversation with your son?\n\nCan they not just Converse with your son, their grandchild about his life? \n\nIt feels deliberate like look how much better our grandson is than you, the other child. \n\nThey're treating your kid like the neighbors kid and not a member of their family", "This statement right here is what you need to say directly to your ILs. Make them understand how hurtful they are being to Luca. And create your boundaries. We said no more discussion of this, you discussed it, now we're/you're leaving. Have a nice day, we'll try again at another time.", "It does feel that way. But I cannot for the life of me understand why."]}
