They could easily say he's doing good and bring him up without always mentioning how close he is to his girlfriends brothers.", "My husband and Henry were close. They are far less close now. At a certain point Henry started blaming my husband for him not seeing his mom and he said he chose me over his mom. None of this is true. Henry's mom chose to be absent and they were broken up long before I met my husband. But Henry always craved time with his mom that she never wanted with him. I think she was only willing to let him move in with her because of his age. She often missed her scheduled parenting time with him. She missed most of his birthday and Christmas too.\n\nIt's not that we don't want to hear anything positive about Henry. We have engaged in some of the conversations about him. But where we have an issue is in regard to bringing up his posting about the two boys he now claims as his brothers when our son is around. That is incredibly hurtful to our son.", "That's our next step.

Make them understand how hurtful they are being to Luca. And create your boundaries. We said no more discussion of this, you discussed it, now we're/you're leaving. Have a nice day, we'll try again at another time.", "It does feel that way. But I cannot for the life of me understand why.", "NTA. They don't like / love you or Luca.", "NTA. I'm not sure why they're being deliberately cruel. They can talk about it outside your Luca's presence if they're soooooo moved he has a better relationship with strangers than his half-brother. Henry is also old enough to know what he's doing. \n\nI would limit contact with them, and also maybe get family therapy.

Like others have said, this feels deliberate. I think they are perfectly aware that it hurts Luca and they don't care. They want to hurt him or they want to hurt you or they want to hurt both of you.

Did your husband make much effort to be his dad despite that choice? \n\nThere seems to be a lot of missing reasons and they appear to be influencing your in-law\u2019s behavior. \n\nAlso have you not explained to Luca that this is nothing to do with who he is as a person?

It's time to cut way back on spending time with them since they refuse to change their behavior.", "OP, you\u2019re not the asshole.

In addition, is there a bit of truth that you are upset Henry rejected you, and you are displacing this hurt on Luca? I've never heard of anybody taking an absent relationship with their sibling so badly they needed therapy.", "NAH. They're free to discuss how your son's half-brother conducts his life. You might not want to hear this, but it sounds like your son's half brother does not see your son as family, which is his right. He's just existing and living his life. He doesn't owe your son brotherhood. \n\nThat said, your son is very young, so hopefully as he ages he will grow out of expecting brotherhood from his half-brother, and this won't be an issue. I would keep your distance, but no one's the asshole - just people living their lives separately.", "So you don\u2019t want your in-laws to be a part of his life because it might upset your son? They can never talk about him in front of you? Because your son feels sad?\n\nI know this is going against what everybody is saying but I think it\u2019s cruel for you to demand the in-laws just ostracize the kid because you don\u2019t want to hear about it. If you don\u2019t want to hear about Henry then don\u2019t go to your in-laws.\n\nThey have every right to discuss Henry. Just stay away from them then if they have to be careful what they say around you. Henry didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You\u2019re making it sound like he did this horrible thing and you don\u2019t want anything to do with them ever again. What a horrible father to just disregard his own son.\n\nI\u2019m glad the grandparents care about him. YTA", "It always breaks my heart when I see these posts talking about siblings and how they don\u2019t view their half siblings as their siblings at all. \nHonestly if it were my husband and I we would threaten no contact if they were treating our sons that way and being considerate of feelings.\nI have two older step children who pretty much have abandoned their biological half little brothers. They never come to see them and never seem to really consider them their siblings most of the time. This kind of treatment negatively affects the rejected siblings on so many levels.\nMy oldest biological son has autism actually and had a stuffed unicorn that represented his sister, her rejection of him hurt so much that he ended up throwing away the unicorn and doesn\u2019t ever want to hear about his sister anymore. He now has another stuffed animal that he treats as if it is his little brother. So for those commenting on Henry\u2019s side I would ask that you take a moment and try to see the perspective of the other side. If you read what OP said, Henry posted something that implied he doesn\u2019t consider Luca his brother even though they are biologically half brothers. How is that okay?\n\nYou\u2019re not the jerk op and I hope Luca comes to being able to cope better and I am so sorry you and your son are having to go through this.", "YTA. If Henry doesn't want a relationship with his brother, that is his decision. Nobody is owed a close relationship. It hurts Luca that Henry is happy and living a good life? Yeah okay. Seems like you spoil this child and he is the clear favourite. No wonder Henry moved out and wants nothing to do with you and your son. You are teaching your son that everybody should only speak about things that make him happy. Henry must have been born at 19 years and was never a child with hurt feelings. You're an asshole.", "NTA However, Henry isn't Lucas brother.  Henry has no blood or emotional tie to him.\n\nSadly you're inadvertently adding to Lucas pain by continuing referring to Henry as his brother.   Yes it socks Henry doesn't want a relationship with him but that's his call.", "[deleted]", "NTA - It's not unreasonable to ask that, because it takes quite literally no effort to just not mention Henry's social media posts around Luca.\n\nIt's not like you're policing what Henry does and force a relationship. It's good he's found a new family and set of brother and while I emphasize with Luca, he's not entitled to a relationship with Henry. \n\nHowever, that doesn't mean others should rub it in Luca's face that his brother wants nothing to do with him, that's just unnecessarily cruel. Definitely lower to contact between you IL and Luca, since it doesn't seem like they care all that much about Luca's mental health.", "How so they love their grandkid. What\u2019s wrong with that. So the father doesn\u2019t like his own kid I\u2019m glad he has grandparents that do.\n\nI would take offense if the stepmother said some thing against my grandson I would be livid.

They are trying to turn the family against Henry. Henry did nothing wrong. I\u2019m glad the family doesn\u2019t agree to it.

She had little interest in being a mom and moved out of state.\n\nHe didn't express that but he was only a toddler when I met him and when we married. He was 7 when Luca was born.\n\nHe said his dad chose me over his mom and blamed him for his mom not being in his life.

I don't want to meet them, I don't want a relationship with them, I don't know them. But without a doubt my father wants me to, and you can't force stuff like that.\n\nLike I'm sorry dude, but maybe Henry just doesn't see a younger child as his brother. You can't FORCE him to be involved.", "They can talk about him, sure. But bringing up how bonded he is with his girlfriends brothers and sharing videos where he claims they made him brothers, etc, is cruel to my son. We don't mind hearing about Henry but given he rejected his brother, half brother sure but to Luca Henry was there from day one until he wasn't, it's going to hurt a 12 year old to hear he has no problem being a big brother to two other boys. And boys around his age too.", "We're hopeful that therapy will get Luca there with time. Makes me wish I could have given him another sibling too. But that was not possible for a number of reasons. So now we just need to get him to a better place with the reality we have. My heart still breaks for him though. It broke his heart when Henry left.", "They are blood related.

That is an acceptable boundary and not policing at all.\n\nLuca has not only now been rejected by Henry but also by his grandparents.

OP didn\u2019t say anything about Henry. At all. And what makes you think the father doesn\u2019t care about his son? I mean you\u2019re just making stuff up just to be negative. \n\nAll OP said is to stop mentioning how much Henry claims these two random boys as his brothers in front of his ACTUAL brother, because it hurts his feelings. If the grandparents and aunt were actually nice people and cared about their grandson/nephew they wouldn\u2019t even need to be told not to be so cruel.

That helps. \n\nThen OP, YTA. This seems to be an unfortunate - yet common - thing that happens when parents fail to blend their families properly. The older son probably felt disrespected and unheard and driven out of his home with his father. His family probably can see that the reason he left is because of the pressure y\u2019all were putting on him to feel something he didn\u2019t feel. From their POV, you and your son drove him out of his home, away from them, and now you\u2019re trying to limit how much they can even talk about him. \n\nHe was being forced to bond with Luca but the bonds with the other children were probably formed more organically. \n\nSounds to me like you\u2019re dealing with the consequences of your failures to properly blend your family. I wouldnt expect Henry\u2019s extended family to think too terribly highly of you after how it seems things went down.", "Well it sure sounds like you don\u2019t want to hear about Henry at all. You\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing. Why can\u2019t their grandparents talk about him to his father. If you don\u2019t like it don\u2019t go. Just go no contact with that side of the family.\n\nI think you\u2019re jealous because they take an interest in Henry. And you demanding that they don\u2019t talk about Henry in front of his father for crying out loud is narcissistic and selfish. I\u2019m glad he has grandparents who care about him Because his father sure doesn\u2019t. His father is choosing Lucas over him and I bet that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t have contact with his own father", "What did Henry do? Henry moved on with his life he wasn\u2019t mean to him he didn\u2019t hit him he didn\u2019t do anything that would be considered cruel. Just because he doesn\u2019t want to see him as a brother or doesn\u2019t want to treat him as a brother doesn\u2019t make him an awful person.", "It\u2019s only hurtful because you make it that way. And the fact that his father isn\u2019t proud of him or wants to hear about him it\u2019s not fair To Henry. I\u2019m sure this is why he\u2019s got no contact with you.\n\nI\u2019m glad he has his grandparents who are proud of him and want to be part of his life. Because everybody now knows that you don\u2019t and neither does his father that\u2019s horrible", "I can now see why Henry went no contact with you", "I can imagine. My son getting his little brother was a surprise blessing. I was told I couldn\u2019t have kids let alone two. Does Luca like animals? I know it may not be the same as a sibling but everyone needs comfort of sorts from various sources.  Have you thought of those emotional support type of pets? Maybe having something to focus on that needs his love and care would help take away some of the hurt.", "Apologies I read step son and thought there was no blood.\n\nSadly Henry doesn't want a relationship with him and  awful though that is, you can't force it", "Well because everybody\u2019s saying what a wonderful parent they are by silencing the grandparents.\n\nThere\u2019s more to the story and I bet Henry felt abandoned when Luca was born. I bet he felt left out because all the attention was on Luca. We don\u2019t know what went on in the past. There\u2019s a reason for the way Henry is.\n\nThe reason that I am posting is because eveyone is against the grandparents and Henry. They don\u2019t want to hear about Henry and his accomplishments. I doubt that they even care. And if the grandparents can\u2019t be proud of who he has become then they should not go over there. I fixate on the fact that the father even agrees. He cares more about Luca than he does about Henry. \n\nI bet this was Henry\u2019s life. Stepmom blaming him for everything dad ignoring Henry in favor of Luca. Down vote me all you want but this is only one side of the story. How about they have Henry post his side I bet it would be different", "Well obviously his dad doesn\u2019t want anything to do with him because he doesn\u2019t want to hear anything about him.\n\nHenry\u2019s been through a lot too and everybody\u2019s just glosses over that.  I have a feeling that his dad having Luca made him feel unwanted. And I just wonder how much time dad spent with Henry and spent it all with Luca. I\u2019m saying that there is more to this. This might be Henry\u2018s way of saying I didn\u2019t get the attention or love I needed. He may even feel that Luca took it away from his dad.\n\nAnd by them saying they don\u2019t want family to talk about this with them is their right but it is not their right to silence them about Henry. Just don\u2019t go. I can see why Henry doesn\u2019t have any contact. He was abandoned a long time ago", "Well they should go no contact with the grandparents. They are so sensitive and insecure to even discuss Henry who happens to be his half brother and their grandchild then they shouldn\u2019t be around them.", "No they\u2019re getting the information that they get from Henry because obviously Henry\u2019s parents don\u2019t care. I say that they go no contact if they expect the grandparents to not mention Henry at all. But remember Henry is still their grandchild too. We don\u2019t know what Henry\u2019s been through that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Personally this is kind of a trivial thing. If Luca is that Damaged by the fact that his half brother doesn\u2019t want anything to do with him that is where the problem is. Lucas parents are supporting him and making Henry the bad guy. But again we don\u2019t know Henry side. I would say there has to be a reason. Maybe he felt abandoned when Luca was born, maybe he felt they wanted nothing to do with him when Luca was born who knows. There\u2019s usually a reason when people go no contact with someone", "So his dad doesn\u2019t wanna be present when they talk about him and his accomplishments? I think there\u2019s a reason Henry is no contact with them.", "Because they are the grandparents of Henry. The father of Henry is having an issue with this and that is wrong. That\u2019s his kid. The grandparents are proud of him why should they have to be silent because his father and stepmother don\u2019t like him. They prefer Lucas. Then don\u2019t go around them stay away they shouldn\u2019t have to be careful what they say about their grandson.", "They shouldn\u2019t ever go again just stay away permanently.

All we ask is when Luca is around to realize hearing some things about Henry hurts him.", "I never said he was an awful person. But Luca's feelings are still hurt. He adored and still adores Henry. He doesn't understand why Henry could be a good brother to two other kids but not him. All we want is to help him through this and for him not to have it rubbed in by his grandparents all the time.", "What did Henry do? So he didn\u2019t treat the stepbrother like a bio brother that is so common. So why should the grandparents have to be silenced around them about Henry? What did Henry do wrong? His father has already pushed him out of his life and wants nothing to do with him and now he expects the grandparents to do the same. If they don\u2019t like the fact that they bring up Henry when they visit then they should not visit. I\u2019m glad his grandparents are proud of him.", "Are you Henry? You\u2019re pouncing on every comment.", "We're aware which is why we're trying to help Luca as much as we can. But it's not easy for him. He adored Henry. Still does.", "No one's saying Henry is a bad person for having that relationship with the other boys. Personally I'm happy for him. \n\nAnd no one's saying the grandparents are AHs for supporting Henry - who no doubt had a hard time with the divorce - good for them.\n\n**Both of these things can be true AND the g'parents can be AHs for refusing to accept that they are *purposefully hurting* their other grandson.**\n\nThey can (and should) love and support Henry all they want.

It's clear, concise and well thought out.\n\nHere's the thing though: we don't know about any of this. It may all be true, it may all be assumption. I personally believe there's a bit of both. Even fully biological siblings can get like this. My older brother is 5 years older than me and apparently when younger was jealous of the new baby in the house after being an only child. That's VERY normal.\n\nHowever, what is being discussed here isn't about the grandparents or the parents. It's about an innocent 12 year old. A 12 year old that doesn't understand these dynamics yet. Who still needs to work on coming to terms with the situation.\n\nWhat doesn't help is the grandparents talking about Henrys new brotherly attachments. The one thing Luca dreamed of. Noone is saying here that Henry shouldn't be talked about at all. They are just stating that at this point in time this boundary needs to be set for LUCAS sake. Which is a reasonable expectation comsidering Luca really is an innocent in all of this\n\nWhat's happening right now, regardless of what has gone on before, is that the grandparents are punishing and hurting Luca (whether intentionally or not) for whatever transgressions the parents have done and THAT is not OK.\n\nWe wouldn't punish kids for a parent stealing. So let's not punish and emotionally harm a kid whose parents may have been crappy to the other child. There's other ways of dealing with it.", "Henry??  Is that you trying to rewrite the post?", "Would you want your grandma to constantly talk about your expartner's new love life at dinner? Showing you photos and videos of how happy your ex is with their new partner? It would probably suck, right? Well they're doing a similar thing to a 12 year old. You can say \"Henry is getting all A's this semester\" without adding, \"And he loves tutoring his new siblings, who he loves and accepts as his new family.\"", "Lol making up stuff doesn\u2019t make it true. Again, go back and try reading the post or any of OPs replies or even my comment. No one is saying not to talk about Henry. I repeat, no one is saying not to talk about Henry.

They can talk about Henry all they want in front of ANYONE, including them.

I told them that's fine but can't they be sensitive to their other grandson/nephew.\n\nThe post says the exact opposite, actually, OP says it's fine to talk about Henry, just not constantly bringing up how great he gets along with his new brothers in front of the brother Henry rejected and was mean to.", "Henry isn't no contact with them?", "Are they good with Luca otherwise?

They should not be silenced about Henry around you and Henry\u2019s father that\u2019s what really gets me. if he cannot handle not being liked by someone, he\u2019s gonna have a hard time in life.

However I\u2019m retired I don\u2019t have much else to do.
