They could easily say he's doing good and bring him up without always mentioning how close he is to his girlfriends brothers.", "My husband and Henry were close. They are far less close now. At a certain point Henry started blaming my husband for him not seeing his mom and he said he chose me over his mom. None of this is true. Henry's mom chose to be absent and they were broken up long before I met my husband. But Henry always craved time with his mom that she never wanted with him. I think she was only willing to let him move in with her because of his age. She often missed her scheduled parenting time with him. She missed most of his birthday and Christmas too.\n\nIt's not that we don't want to hear anything positive about Henry. We have engaged in some of the conversations about him. But where we have an issue is in regard to bringing up his posting about the two boys he now claims as his brothers when our son is around. That is incredibly hurtful to our son.", "That's our next step.

Make them understand how hurtful they are being to Luca. And create your boundaries. We said no more discussion of this, you discussed it, now we're/you're leaving. Have a nice day, we'll try again at another time.", "It does feel that way. But I cannot for the life of me understand why.", "NTA. They don't like / love you or Luca.", "NTA. I'm not sure why they're being deliberately cruel. They can talk about it outside your Luca's presence if they're soooooo moved he has a better relationship with strangers than his half-brother. Henry is also old enough to know what he's doing. \n\nI would limit contact with them, and also maybe get family therapy.

Why he rejected the relationships with you and his half brother, I'm sure he could tell us quite the tale.  \n\nBut none of that has anything to do with his grandparents behavior which is bad.", "NTA at all. Like others have said, this feels deliberate. I think they are perfectly aware that it hurts Luca and they don't care. They want to hurt him or they want to hurt you or they want to hurt both of you.

Did your husband make much effort to be his dad despite that choice? \n\nThere seems to be a lot of missing reasons and they appear to be influencing your in-law\u2019s behavior. \n\nAlso have you not explained to Luca that this is nothing to do with who he is as a person? Like\u2026..clearly, and often??", "NTA - what is wrong with people!!??", "NTA.

It's time to cut way back on spending time with them since they refuse to change their behavior.", "OP, you\u2019re not the asshole.

In addition, is there a bit of truth that you are upset Henry rejected you, and you are displacing this hurt on Luca? I've never heard of anybody taking an absent relationship with their sibling so badly they needed therapy.", "NAH. They're free to discuss how your son's half-brother conducts his life. You might not want to hear this, but it sounds like your son's half brother does not see your son as family, which is his right. He's just existing and living his life. He doesn't owe your son brotherhood. \n\nThat said, your son is very young, so hopefully as he ages he will grow out of expecting brotherhood from his half-brother, and this won't be an issue. I would keep your distance, but no one's the asshole - just people living their lives separately.", "So you don\u2019t want your in-laws to be a part of his life because it might upset your son? They can never talk about him in front of you? Because your son feels sad?\n\nI know this is going against what everybody is saying but I think it\u2019s cruel for you to demand the in-laws just ostracize the kid because you don\u2019t want to hear about it. If you don\u2019t want to hear about Henry then don\u2019t go to your in-laws.\n\nThey have every right to discuss Henry. Just stay away from them then if they have to be careful what they say around you. Henry didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You\u2019re making it sound like he did this horrible thing and you don\u2019t want anything to do with them ever again. What a horrible father to just disregard his own son.\n\nI\u2019m glad the grandparents care about him. YTA", "It always breaks my heart when I see these posts talking about siblings and how they don\u2019t view their half siblings as their siblings at all. \nHonestly if it were my husband and I we would threaten no contact if they were treating our sons that way and being considerate of feelings.\nI have two older step children who pretty much have abandoned their biological half little brothers. They never come to see them and never seem to really consider them their siblings most of the time. This kind of treatment negatively affects the rejected siblings on so many levels.\nMy oldest biological son has autism actually and had a stuffed unicorn that represented his sister, her rejection of him hurt so much that he ended up throwing away the unicorn and doesn\u2019t ever want to hear about his sister anymore. He now has another stuffed animal that he treats as if it is his little brother. So for those commenting on Henry\u2019s side I would ask that you take a moment and try to see the perspective of the other side. If you read what OP said, Henry posted something that implied he doesn\u2019t consider Luca his brother even though they are biologically half brothers. How is that okay?\n\nYou\u2019re not the jerk op and I hope Luca comes to being able to cope better and I am so sorry you and your son are having to go through this.", "YTA. If Henry doesn't want a relationship with his brother, that is his decision. Nobody is owed a close relationship. It hurts Luca that Henry is happy and living a good life? Yeah okay. Seems like you spoil this child and he is the clear favourite. No wonder Henry moved out and wants nothing to do with you and your son. You are teaching your son that everybody should only speak about things that make him happy. Henry must have been born at 19 years and was never a child with hurt feelings. You're an asshole.", "NTA However, Henry isn't Lucas brother.  Henry has no blood or emotional tie to him.\n\nSadly you're inadvertently adding to Lucas pain by continuing referring to Henry as his brother.   Yes it socks Henry doesn't want a relationship with him but that's his call.", "[deleted]", "NTA - It's not unreasonable to ask that, because it takes quite literally no effort to just not mention Henry's social media posts around Luca.\n\nIt's not like you're policing what Henry does and force a relationship. It's good he's found a new family and set of brother and while I emphasize with Luca, he's not entitled to a relationship with Henry. \n\nHowever, that doesn't mean others should rub it in Luca's face that his brother wants nothing to do with him, that's just unnecessarily cruel. Definitely lower to contact between you IL and Luca, since it doesn't seem like they care all that much about Luca's mental health.", "How so they love their grandkid. What\u2019s wrong with that. So the father doesn\u2019t like his own kid I\u2019m glad he has grandparents that do.\n\nI would take offense if the stepmother said some thing against my grandson I would be livid.

They are trying to turn the family against Henry. Henry did nothing wrong. I\u2019m glad the family doesn\u2019t agree to it.

She had little interest in being a mom and moved out of state.\n\nHe didn't express that but he was only a toddler when I met him and when we married. He was 7 when Luca was born.\n\nHe said his dad chose me over his mom and blamed him for his mom not being in his life.

My husband still tries and has tried visiting but Henry didn't want to see him.\n\nYes, we have explained this to him.", "1000000%, my father left when I was a kid and years later I now have like 5 half siblings. I don't want to meet them, I don't want a relationship with them, I don't know them. But without a doubt my father wants me to, and you can't force stuff like that.\n\nLike I'm sorry dude, but maybe Henry just doesn't see a younger child as his brother. You can't FORCE him to be involved.", "They can talk about him, sure. But bringing up how bonded he is with his girlfriends brothers and sharing videos where he claims they made him brothers, etc, is cruel to my son. We don't mind hearing about Henry but given he rejected his brother, half brother sure but to Luca Henry was there from day one until he wasn't, it's going to hurt a 12 year old to hear he has no problem being a big brother to two other boys. And boys around his age too.", "We're hopeful that therapy will get Luca there with time. Makes me wish I could have given him another sibling too. But that was not possible for a number of reasons. So now we just need to get him to a better place with the reality we have. My heart still breaks for him though. It broke his heart when Henry left.", "They are blood related.

That is an acceptable boundary and not policing at all.\n\nLuca has not only now been rejected by Henry but also by his grandparents.

OP didn\u2019t say anything about Henry. At all. And what makes you think the father doesn\u2019t care about his son? I mean you\u2019re just making stuff up just to be negative. \n\nAll OP said is to stop mentioning how much Henry claims these two random boys as his brothers in front of his ACTUAL brother, because it hurts his feelings. If the grandparents and aunt were actually nice people and cared about their grandson/nephew they wouldn\u2019t even need to be told not to be so cruel.

That helps. \n\nThen OP, YTA. This seems to be an unfortunate - yet common - thing that happens when parents fail to blend their families properly. The older son probably felt disrespected and unheard and driven out of his home with his father. His family probably can see that the reason he left is because of the pressure y\u2019all were putting on him to feel something he didn\u2019t feel. From their POV, you and your son drove him out of his home, away from them, and now you\u2019re trying to limit how much they can even talk about him. \n\nHe was being forced to bond with Luca but the bonds with the other children were probably formed more organically. \n\nSounds to me like you\u2019re dealing with the consequences of your failures to properly blend your family. I wouldnt expect Henry\u2019s extended family to think too terribly highly of you after how it seems things went down.", "Well it sure sounds like you don\u2019t want to hear about Henry at all. You\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing. Why can\u2019t their grandparents talk about him to his father. If you don\u2019t like it don\u2019t go. Just go no contact with that side of the family.\n\nI think you\u2019re jealous because they take an interest in Henry. And you demanding that they don\u2019t talk about Henry in front of his father for crying out loud is narcissistic and selfish. I\u2019m glad he has grandparents who care about him Because his father sure doesn\u2019t. His father is choosing Lucas over him and I bet that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t have contact with his own father", "What did Henry do? Henry moved on with his life he wasn\u2019t mean to him he didn\u2019t hit him he didn\u2019t do anything that would be considered cruel. Just because he doesn\u2019t want to see him as a brother or doesn\u2019t want to treat him as a brother doesn\u2019t make him an awful person.", "It\u2019s only hurtful because you make it that way. And the fact that his father isn\u2019t proud of him or wants to hear about him it\u2019s not fair To Henry. I\u2019m sure this is why he\u2019s got no contact with you.\n\nI\u2019m glad he has his grandparents who are proud of him and want to be part of his life. Because everybody now knows that you don\u2019t and neither does his father that\u2019s horrible", "I can now see why Henry went no contact with you", "I can imagine. My son getting his little brother was a surprise blessing. I was told I couldn\u2019t have kids let alone two. Does Luca like animals? I know it may not be the same as a sibling but everyone needs comfort of sorts from various sources.  Have you thought of those emotional support type of pets? Maybe having something to focus on that needs his love and care would help take away some of the hurt.", "Apologies I read step son and thought there was no blood.\n\nSadly Henry doesn't want a relationship with him and  awful though that is, you can't force it", "Well because everybody\u2019s saying what a wonderful parent they are by silencing the grandparents.\n\nThere\u2019s more to the story and I bet Henry felt abandoned when Luca was born. I bet he felt left out because all the attention was on Luca. We don\u2019t know what went on in the past. There\u2019s a reason for the way Henry is.\n\nThe reason that I am posting is because eveyone is against the grandparents and Henry. They don\u2019t want to hear about Henry and his accomplishments. I doubt that they even care. And if the grandparents can\u2019t be proud of who he has become then they should not go over there. I fixate on the fact that the father even agrees. He cares more about Luca than he does about Henry. \n\nI bet this was Henry\u2019s life. Stepmom blaming him for everything dad ignoring Henry in favor of Luca. Down vote me all you want but this is only one side of the story. How about they have Henry post his side I bet it would be different", "Well obviously his dad doesn\u2019t want anything to do with him because he doesn\u2019t want to hear anything about him.\n\nHenry\u2019s been through a lot too and everybody\u2019s just glosses over that.  I have a feeling that his dad having Luca made him feel unwanted. And I just wonder how much time dad spent with Henry and spent it all with Luca. I\u2019m saying that there is more to this. This might be Henry\u2018s way of saying I didn\u2019t get the attention or love I needed. He may even feel that Luca took it away from his dad.\n\nAnd by them saying they don\u2019t want family to talk about this with them is their right but it is not their right to silence them about Henry. Just don\u2019t go. I can see why Henry doesn\u2019t have any contact. He was abandoned a long time ago", "Well they should go no contact with the grandparents. They are so sensitive and insecure to even discuss Henry who happens to be his half brother and their grandchild then they shouldn\u2019t be around them.", "No they\u2019re getting the information that they get from Henry because obviously Henry\u2019s parents don\u2019t care. I say that they go no contact if they expect the grandparents to not mention Henry at all. But remember Henry is still their grandchild too. We don\u2019t know what Henry\u2019s been through that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Personally this is kind of a trivial thing.

That\u2019s like decent human 101 stuff.", ">he doesn\u2019t want to hear anything about him.\n\nWhere on earth did you read that?? Did you even read the post or you're just making up stuff in your head?", "Ah here it is.  Your reading comprehension is sorely lacking.  As others have pointed out they only requested that they don't discuss the older child's social media posts around the younger son.  Also who the fuck brags about what someone is posting on social media like that let alone does so in front of a child they know is hurt by the rejection of his older brother?  That seems targeted and done with malice.  What grandparent purposefully upsets their grandchild like that?  I'll tell you, a shitty grandparent.\n\nYou should enroll in some local adult classes for reading comprehension.  You're sorely lacking in that very basic ability.  Also maybe enroll in therapy so you can learn some empathy since you're ok with purposefully upsetting young children just because you can't wait till that child is out of earshot to discuss something.\n\nYou sound insufferable.", "OPs only issue is that they seem to enjoy telling one of their grandchildren their other grandchild proudly declared on social media that his half brother doesn't exist. \n\nWhat a trash take. They're so sensitive and insecure because *checks notes* were showing public posts of our bio-grandchild declaring his half sibling never existed despite being repeatedly asked to show some compassion for their younger bio-grandchild.\n\nDo you also cut off your nose to spite your face when you think you're not getting your way on 1% of a whole relationship?", "Do you have some kind of mental illness that's preventing you to understand a text?? Or are you just a sad wanker who is stupid??", ">I agree they should just go no contact\n\nI agree too. Grandparents and henry can go fuck off", "So what happens when those kids become Henry step kids. He won\u2019t be allowed anywhere near his family because of Luca and Henry knows that", "Ikr omg", "That\u2019s not my point my point is if he married this girl those will be his step kids and he won\u2019t be allowed around his family because of those kids. That\u2019s pretty awful.", "Well they may be his new family. Seems that\u2019s all he\u2019s got. I bet they\u2019ve told Henry that if he can\u2019t take Luca on the way they want he\u2019s not allowed at the house I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why he left", "So maybe they should give a script to the in-laws as to what\u2019s acceptable to Luca and what isn\u2019t. They obviously can\u2019t talk about Henry and his girlfriend because that will traumatize Luca, I can\u2019t talk about Henry\u2019s happy new life because that will traumatize Luca. There\u2019s more to the story I would love to hear Henry side", "Well you do too if you take what everyone says as the Bible. There\u2019s a reason Henry has gotten no contact with them. We will never know because all we\u2019re hearing about his stepmom\u2018s side of the story I would love to hear Henry\u2019s.\n\nSo again if he marries this girl he\u2019s become his step kids and he cares about them as he should. His family is already said they don\u2019t want anything to do with him or these kids so I see why he\u2019s got no contact and like I say I think There\u2019s more to this maybe Luca was the golden child who knows we\u2019ll never know", "OK that\u2019s her story. But how was Henry treated after Luca was born. Was he pushed aside? Was look at the main focus of the family now? Stepmom obviously cared more about Luca. Again we don\u2019t know the whole story we only know what she saying", "Because no matter what they say about Henry and his relationship with his girlfriend poor little Luke is going to get his feelings hurt and mommy and daddy will shield him and blame Henry and the in-laws.", "Well you are pretty stupid because this goes much deeper than the grandparents being proud of their grandson and their parents don\u2019t want to hear about it.\n\nWe\u2019re only hearing her side. I bet Henry side is much different. We will never know. I would hope that if they want to really say what\u2019s going on they would have Henry post also but they won\u2019t because I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t go with their narrative.\n\nSo they\u2019ve cut him off and they\u2019re trying to cut him off from his grandparents. If he married this girl they\u2019re gonna be his step kids which won\u2019t be allowed around his family. That\u2019s pretty mean. You love who you love. Not everybody is going to love you. They should just go no contact with the grandparents if they don\u2019t want to hear about Henry. Because no matter what they say they\u2019ll find something wrong with it. I feel bad for Henry, his family has cut him off. And I have a feeling Luca was the golden child and that\u2019s part of the problem but we\u2019ll never know for sure", " Again we don\u2019t know Henry\u2019s story. I\u2019m sure he would tell a different story. They are putting Luca above Henry and I have a feeling that may be part of the story we won\u2019t know.", "They're implying they have inside knowledge to the situation. Either Henry or one of the grandparents. They just won't come right out and say it. Probably just a very committed troll", "And spoiled little Luca can stay in his cocoon and cry Call mommy and daddy protect him against big bad Henry", "But the grandparents do care about him. And I\u2019m sure they know what\u2019s been going on all these years. But the golden child has to come first I understand", "Henry abandoned this family cause he wanted to live with the mother who abandoned him. Read the fucking post you moron and stop mKing up stuff based on nothing", "There is no reason at all to bring up kids that aren't related to the father, step-mom, or Luca when they've requested to not hear about them.  There's no relation to them.  None.  You sound like a petulant child.", "What kids will be his step kids? His girlfriends brothers? That's not how that works...", "You\u2019re reaching pretty hard.", ">mommy and daddy will shield him\n\nGood cause henry sounds like a spoiled annoying aasshole.", "[removed]", "Well again we\u2019re only hearing her side. Will never know Henry side.", "Agreed", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

If yes, you need therapy. You\u2019ve placed all the feelings of your mother\u2019s abandonment at your fathers feet and also blamed an innocent child - your brother. \nAre you the in-laws? If yes, then you know this isn\u2019t about talking about Henry in general it\u2019s talking about one aspect of what Henry posts on social media (which isn\u2019t always a good representation of reality anyway) and your desire to deliberately hurt your other grandchild. \nIf neither, then as others have said your reading comprehension is awful and you really need to stfu", "By your own logic that means everyone on AITA is TA because the vast majority of the time we only hear one side.\n\nThe fuck are you even doing on this sub then?", "So what happens if he marries this girl and they become Henry\u2019s step kids. They will have to keep the kids away from dad and family because Luca got his feelings hurt. We can love whoever we want. And if Luca is that sensitive but he can\u2019t accept that Henry is not his best bud then he\u2019s in for a very sad life. So the dad has thrown Henry away in favor of Luca and I have a feeling that\u2019s been going on all along. Now we may know why Henry has cut them out because Luca is the golden child", "They are his girlfriends siblings not her children \ud83d\ude44\nPlease read this post properly before responding again."]}
