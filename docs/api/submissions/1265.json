Her daughter was 12 when we got married, and now at 22 is getting married. I raised and supported her for much for her life and feel like she is my biological daughter. Her bio dad was a drug user and not around much. Her fianc\u00e9 is a wonderful young man who I get along really great with. The only issue is he is very religious and insists the wedding is performed at his church. My family and I are very religious as well and of the same religion, but it is the actual church that I have an issue with. I used to work as that church about 15 years ago and the priest was a terrible tyrant to me. He made me work all the time, come in in my vacation, make a mess and then have me clean it, etc. It all came to a head one day when he told me to clean a clogged toilet with no glove and I refused. He got furious, his face turned red, and he started yelling that I was trying to rise up on him and that he was my master. I tried to flee, and he followed me screaming. I still have pstd. I was terrified when I found out the wedding was going to be at that church and the same priest was there. At first I didn\u2019t want to go at all but eventually I agreed as long as I could stand in the back. My stepdaughter said she wants me to walk her down the aisle.

If it's a genuine fear and you think you could have a panic attack you need to actually talk to your step daughter and explain your fear/what happened. If you just said I don't want to because I dont like that church then yeah I can see everyone being mad at you. NTA for a genuine fear but maybe some counseling would be in order.", "Have an honest and open discussion with your daughter. If you have a solid relationship she will likely understand. There are many father/daughter moments to be had at weddings, toasts, father/daughter dance etc. She is not a child and if she is old enough to understand.", "I can\u2019t actually believe the ah votes here. You\u2019ve admitted that this person caused you actual trauma. NTA. \n\nCan you ask your daughter to find another priest from the next church over?", "YTA. You are a grown person now. He holds no power over you now. Hes probably an old man. Dont let your daughter down, you only get one.", "NAH, but it would be better if you communicated your reasoning very clearly. Your daughter, because she is, basically, your daughter, really wants and needs this support from her father. Have you communicated the full situation to her? Could you perhaps see a therapist or request that that particular priest not attend?", "Reported for shitposting. If you doubt it just look at his responses.", "This is a tough one. \n\nI'm gonna say NAH - BUT with a huge caveat.\n\nShe is your daughter. You've said that you basically raised her, love her as her own, and everything having to do with that.  You're happy for her and want to be a part of this huge event. You acknowledge that you are definitely suffering from some trauma regarding the man who will be officiating (rightfully so - sounds like he's a piece of work). You're NTA for not wanting to have to be around this awful man, BUT this is the time (well past the time, to be honest) for you to start addressing this trauma and working on it so that when her wedding comes around, you WILL be able to walk her down the aisle.\n\nI think it's time to sit down with her and explain the situation if you haven't already and follow it up with, \"I'm going to be addressing this with a therapist because I know how he treated me wasn't fair or okay, and I know that I need to learn how to deal with this experience in a healthier manner. I want to be able to be there for you just like I have always been, because I love you.\" Then, find a therapist ASAP.", "I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. \n\nYou got yelled at by your boss. Happens all the time. You were frightened by a man in power. Happens to women every single day. \n\nInfo- what treatment have you pursued for your ptsd?", "NTA\n\nHaving a PTSD attack mid way down the aisle will really put a dampener on the whole celebration.", "YTA\n\nI really don't blame you for feeling the way that you do, that priest sounds totally off his rocker. However - what is more important to you? Continuing to allow this event to impact you or be there for your step daughter on a day she really needs the support of her parents? Because I promise you, she will not forget the fact that you didn't walk her down the aisle and that will impact her... you see what I'm getting at here? \n\nYou're already going to be at the wedding. Whether you need extra support from your wife, spiritual guidance from your own priest, to walk her up and then back to the back of the church or getting some therapy, I think you need to find a way to take your power back so that this doesn't continue impacting you.", "Info: have you told your stepdaughter how that priest treated you?", "INFO: Are you sure it will be the same priest? Even if it's supposed to be, maybe they can get a Deacon (or a Bishop) for the ceremony instead?", "NTA\n\nforget the stepdaughter part.  you have a legitimate reason for wanting to have that boundary, it doesn't make you any less of a parent.  it may be her day, but you're still a person, not a prop.  emotional and verbal abuse is still abuse, and even if her and her fianc\u00e9 don't think it's that serious, they're not the ones that lived it", "YTA \nThis is a big day and for your stepdaughter (who you said is like your biological daughter.) This day will be one that they think about for the rest of their lives, don't be the one to ruin it for her, that's a big burden to carry forever and a big spot for resentment she may hold. \n\nThink about the grandkids some day they'll ask or be told about this story too.", "I'm going with NTA. Trauma and PTSD are very valid reasons. If Daughter and FSIL are not willing to have someone else marry them, then I am inclined to say they are the AH. You should not have to be full of fear and anxiety during such an event. I certainly wouldn't want someone who has caused pain and trauma to my loved one to be involved in the biggest/happiest/ most important day in my life.", "Easy NTA! Your refusal to walk her down the aisle is simply because you'd be subjecting yourself to an abusive AH/priest. Even though it's her wedding day, would she really want you, a man she views and wants to honor as her father figure, to be absolutely miserable during the ceremony?\n\nHave you shared your history with this priest with your daughter-in-law? I'm curious if this priest is the make-and-break \"it has to be him that marries us\" for your future SIL. It might be worth sharing your experience with them- or at least with your stepdaughter- in case another priest is available to marry them instead!", "YTA, this is your stepdaughter's wedding.", "Reported for shitposting. Find a better use of your time dude.", "NAH but I don't think you should let the past hold this much power over you. Is your love for your daughter less powerful than your fear of that man. Especially in a room full of people that care for you? You wouldn't be facing him alone.", "ESH. while it's unfortunate you had a terrible experience with an abusive priest, this will be the only chance you have to walk your stepdaughter down the aisle. \n\ninfo: did your stepdaughter know about these incidents when she picked the church/priest?", "YTA. You don't have \"PTSD\" from someone yelling at you.\n\nYour refusal to walk your daughter down the aisle because the priest at her church was mean to you 15 years ago is selfish and childish.  \n\nIt's so absurd that your daughter probably won't even believe this is the real reason. She's likely to think you're refusing because you don't see her as your real daughter.  Your relationship with her will never be the same again if you pull this little stunt.", "[deleted]", "NTA", "YTA. The priest is not going to cause a scene in front of church full of people, if he does that's going to make him quite possibly be the biggest non-criminal asshole for a long while.\n\nBe there for your step-daughter.", "15 years ago and you are still so traumatized that you can't be in the same room with the dude for 30 minutes?  \n\nHave you tried counseling?
