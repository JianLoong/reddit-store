I don't understand why you're even entertaining her arguments about this.  This has been going on since November?  It's long past time to cut contact with her until she can learn some bloody manners.", "Long story short, sir you are not the AH.\n\n its none of her business what name you choose for your son/daughter, no one should ever have a say in that except you and your wife and thats it, they can give you some ideas IF YOU ASK FOR THEM.", "NTA. No one gets a vote on your kid\u2019s name but you and your wife. Why can\u2019t she just talk about you behind your back like a normal person?", "NTA\n\nAs someone with an Irish name, points from me for the old-style Gaelic name~", "Cael is a name. Irish/ Gaelic origin. So not does her opinion not matter at all, she is literally wrong that it isn't a name.\n\nGood for you and partner for choosing a name you like. Who cares what your family thinks. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It looks a reasonable name is it pronounced kay-ill", "NTA. Your sister is OVERSTEPPING. She dont have to like it but there's exactly squat she can do about it. I would tell her to stay mad.. and she dont have worry about it bc I wouldn't take my child near a hateful person that is supposed to be a loving aunt.", "NTA\n\n>My sister has been seriously outspoken on the name. She said it's not a name, it's wrong to break from the tradition, she asked my wife how she could put son through that when s**he's spent 28 years with a ridiculous name**.\n\nCael is an Irish name, so I presume that your wife's name is also Irish? \n\nAnd that your sister is a pretty monolingual English-speaker?", "Like\u2026. Kale????\nNTA but it is weird if that\u2019s how you say it lol", "Nta. I think what you said about having a traditional name and still hating it is very astute.", "The only one who has to like the name is your kid. If he doesn't, you'll definitely hear about it in  5-7 years. NTA", "Well, this is bizarre. \n\nYTA", "NTA. I hate that excuse 'I'm entitled to my opinion'. Like yes, you are but you are not entitled to share it where it hasn't been asked for it. Period. Full stop. Especially after being told you don't want their opinion. I have 2 kids and am pregnant now. My first was named after his dad so he got a normal ass name but my second is Niklaus and my third will be Itachi. Not normal names and people always question where the names come from and have something to say about it but as soon as I tell them it is what it is, they stop. Like the audacity to continue offering your shitty opinion after being asked to stop is beyond me.", "NTA.\n\nHorrible name, but NTA.", "NTA.  I happen to like that name. I do come from a family of traditional names but I also come from a family of old country names or names that reflect our heritage. So lots of Scottish and French names. And while my grandfathers offered input on my name (only child to be named after my late grandmothers) they were not the deciding factors. Stick to your guns. As I said, I like that name and it's a strong Gaelic name. Congratulations!", "NTA. You did nothing wrong in the slightest. Your sister was way out of bounds and she needs a reality check. The parents name the child, it's really that simple. She's allowed to think whatever she wants to about the name but she seems to think she has the right to object to the name you and your partner chose because reasons I guess? Hopefully she will have gotten over this by the time your child is a lil older. It would be a very sucky thing to tell a child that their name doesn't fit into their family.\n\nAs someone who also hates their name, I'd just like to say that Cael sounds like really cool.", "NTA. When your family brings up \u201ctradition\u201d, tell them your wife\u2019s family has a tradition of having the parents name their child a name they like. \n\nAlso Cael is a cool name. I know a Kale. (Assuming it\u2019s pronounced the same).", "Wait\u2026 so she insulted your name idea while also telling your wife that she has a stupid name? The nerve!\n\nNTA", "You're 100% correct, it is only you and your wife's business what you name your child. I'm just hoping it's not pronounced \"Kale\". Kids can be pretty mean \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, but also out of curiosity, is it like kale with one syllable, or like kah-el using 2 syllables? Honestly I love both, just wondering, and it's your business what you name him, not anyone else's.", "NTA. 1. It's nobody's business what you name your child. 2. Isn't Cael a very traditional Celtic or Gaelic name? So if they are so for tradition, throw that in their faces while you tell them once and for all to fuck off.", "NTA. Your sister can have all the opinions she wants, but she doesn't get to belittle and harass people with them.", "NTA", "I HATED my name growing up.  Not only was it old fashioned but I was the 3rd (my dad being Jr.).  My mom didn\u2019t want to name me after my dad but relented in the end.  At 19 I legally changed my name to what my mother originally wanted (my middle name still honors my dads side of the family).  At the end of the day you can change your name; your son may some day choose to change his name.  Just because someone chose a name for you doesn\u2019t mean you need to keep it for life.  So, you\u2019re NTA.  Your sister, however, is one and should keep her opinion to herself.  When she pops a kid out she can name him or her whatever she wants.", "OP, NTA. \n\nYour sister got it half right when she said she was entitled  ~~to give her opinion~~", "NTA. She offered her opinion once, and then she should have let it go.\n\nThere\u2019s a naming post from AITA not too long ago.  Your situations only share the similarity in that a loved one (your sister/that naming post\u2019s OP) expressed a concern about the name of the new baby. My opinion on that is the same, that OP is NTA for bringing up her opinion about the name *once* and then letting it go. If I remember correctly, OP let it go and didn\u2019t bring it up again until the parent asked her because OP\u2019s concerns came to light. [link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/ycf4yq/aita_for_raining_on_my_cousins_parade_regarding/)  That\u2019s what your sister should have done. She should have let it go.  She\u2019s an asshole now for overstepping her boundaries.", "Nta. Fun fact- my nephew's name is Kael. And I've heard of quite a few. It's not \"old person\" traditional, but it's becoming more common. That's why the \"top 100 names\" list changes every year, people's tastes change.", "NTA- Cael isn\u2019t even that out there, and honestly some of those old fashioned names are awful, I know so many elderly people who even hated their own name so much the chose other names to go by", "Cael is a great name. NTA.\n\nI did a pediatric intern year, and some of the names I saw... Interesting choices out there.\n\nThere's a lady from Wisconsin named Marijuana Pepsi (first as middle name) She got a PhD and wrote about naming cultures.", "Problematic as most will think Kale", ">You can't get more traditional than that. \n\nRamses is also a good name.", "I thought that sounded Irish.", "Dependsnm on what wife's name is and whether or not she complained about it.", "Yes, see comment above", "That's not really fair to OP though. How can he explain why he thinks his son will like the name when literally no one can predict what their kids will like? You pick a name *you* like and hope for the best. That's what everyone does. I have a different name and I love it. There was no way for my parents to know if I would or not so they picked a name they loved and thankfully I love it too. As long as OP doesn't guilt trip his son in the future if he happens to want to change his name, then he's NTA.", "Believe it or not, there are people with different / interesting names that love their names and don't view them as a handicap. I happen to be one of them.", "OP makes it sound like this has been going on since the baby was born in November.  It's long since time to cut contact with obnoxious sister until she learns some manners.", "I would hate to live in your country. My name is in Greek mythology and I love it.", "There was young girl in New Zealand who had to sue her parents to change her name from \u2018Tula does the Hula in Hawaii\u2019. She was around 11 years old and when the judge awarded her the right he told her parents an 11 year old shouldn\u2019t have more sense than grown adults.\n\nThis was back in the 90\u2019s but I\u2019ve never forgotten it.", "Xaiquiri is a Chinese name. \u971e\u79cb\u65e5. Let people name their kids.", "I keep reading it the way Cartman says Kyle on South Park.

He doesn\u2019t hate his name and nobody said squat to his Mom when she named him.", "I'm a huge Sephiroth fan and would never.  What is with people naming their kids fandom stuff?", "This thread has tickled me. Im gonna now name my future imaginary kids like FF characters. In addition to little Squal, Laguna, and Raine, I'm gonna perhaps add an Ocean, River, Spring, and baby Sprinkle. \n\nGuess I gotta ditch them kids and ship them off to a military for good measure, too.", "Denmark has very strict rules and regulations of names as well. \nNames like as Judas or Lucifer is forbidden but also names without any obvious negative \u201cundertones\u201d like Po, Bandito or Petit. There is an official list of approved names and you have to seek permission from the authorities if you wish to use other names or change the spelling of an approved name. \n\nLast names are also regulated although not as strict.

It's not actually the Latin word, which would be a k, but a derivative of a long legacy of words that have a mix of S and K pronunciations.", "Sora, Riku & Kairi are all real names...\n\nSephiroth...not necessarily the energy I'd want to expose a kid to...", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 that's what we named our dogs!
