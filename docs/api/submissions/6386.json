My point is that every time this somebody reads this kid's name (school, job application, Tinder, arrest warrant, etc.) he is going to have to explain how to pronounce it, and also how to spell it when he tells it to people, etc.  That shit gets really old really fast, and now he gets to do it for his entire life unless he packs up and heads to Ireland.\n\nHow about if you, just for fun, learn how to read for context rather than just jumping to the conclusion that gets your hackles raised and causes you to come off as extremely ignorant.
