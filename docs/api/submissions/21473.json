And has ever since been blaming literally every single one of her issues on her auto immune disease. Even if the issue is completely irrelevant. She stubbed her toe? It\u2019s because of her disease. She\u2019s late to an event? It\u2019s because of her disease. She doesn\u2019t feel well? It\u2019s because of her disease. Doctors told her she\u2019s probably had this her entire life.\n\nBut she also 5 years ago got breast implants. And ever since then was when she said she started feeling so sick and horrible all of the time. If y\u2019all don\u2019t know, breast implant illness is a real thing. It\u2019s very common where women who get breast implants will start feeling sick after getting them. \n\nNow yesterday we had some other family over at our house because they were in town for a bit and my sister is doing her usual complaining about how horrible she feels all the time and how it\u2019s because of her auto immune disease. I just got fed up with her complaining and told her that her being sick all of the time and feeling horrible is because of her breast implants. Because she didn\u2019t start feeling that way until after she got them. \n\nNow she didn\u2019t like that I said that at all and started screaming at me that \u201cyou don\u2019t know what the f*ck you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re just trying to make this all about you.\u201d And so on. Me and her went back and forth for a minute until our mother stepped in the room and heard what was going on and pulled me into the other room with her and told me I was an AH for saying that because \u201cyou don\u2019t know your sister better than she knows herself\u201d and \u201cyou exposed and embarrassed her in front of family.\u201d (Family members visiting didn\u2019t know she had breast implants, my sister kept it very much on the down low to everyone about getting breast implants) so yes I see how I might\u2019ve embarrassed her, but truth was gonna come out anyways. \n\nI really don\u2019t think what I did was wrong at all, because I think it\u2019s pretty obvious, this is breast implant illness!

It was completely unnecessary to say. \n\nAlso you're not a doctor - just because you read about breast implant illness doesn't make you one and it certainly doesn't make you an expert on hashimoto's. Regardless of why your sister is not feeling well, the lack of empathy you have over her not feeling well is odd. If you're truly concerned about her welfare then you would encourage her to go see her doctor versus outing her at a family outing.\n\nWhen speaking ask yourself the three questions\nIs it true?\nIs it kind?\nIs it necessary?", "I mean, you\u2019re not a doctor. You can\u2019t diagnose her illness and you don\u2019t know how she actually feels, you have no idea how sick she might actually be. Wether it\u2019s the implants or not picking a fight with her at a family gathering was always gonna be an AH move. Have you ever suggested that the implants were the cause before? Have you tried to understand just what she\u2019s dealing with? \n\nAlso complete AH move to disclose that she has implants when she didn\u2019t want people to know. She\u2019ll probably get judged very harshly by your family now. \n\nOver all I think YTA, you need to communicate with your sister and apologize for the blow up, then explain that you\u2019ve heard of implants making people sick and you\u2019re worried about her.", "YTA.  One of the hard things about having an autoimmune disorder is that it absolutely can make you sick all the time, especially if it\u2019s not managed well.  In an average year, my autoimmune disorder flares up about 4 times (and it takes 3-6 weeks of strong medications to get a flare to go down).  In a bad year, I alternate between having infections because my autoimmune meds suppress my immune system and having autoimmune flares because they always happen after I fight off a bacterial or viral infection - I\u2019ve been sick one way or the other for 16 months straight once.\n\nIt\u2019s very common with autoimmune disorders to have a date when your symptoms start and then never go away.  Mine was August of 2007, though I didn\u2019t get diagnosed until November 2013.  It\u2019s been over 15 years since my onset date, and I\u2019ve never had a time when I didn\u2019t at a minimum have chronic pain and fatigue from the damage my autoimmune disorder has caused.  Never.  Unless an autoimmune disorder goes into remission, that\u2019s pretty common.\n\nYou shared your sister\u2019s medical info, and you did it because you\u2019re ignorant, which is a lousy reason.", "If you're not her doctor,  don't try to diagnose her. YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re sister is right, you don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about. You\u2019re not in a position to diagnose her or know the cause of her symptoms.", "YTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t need to tell her that in front of everyone, and really it isn\u2019t your business anyways. You could\u2019ve told her this when you two were alone. But even still, you could very well be wrong, I know someone with Hashimoto\u2019s disease and it does make them feel fatigued and a bit ill sometimes. But how I said, still isn\u2019t really your place to be saying that, especially not in front of people!!", "YTA You're really out here trying to downplay how much your embarrassed your sister?  \n\n\nAlso your sister's business is her own to deal with. If she keeps mentioning she's not doing great, she should get a second opinion just incase. But guess what, you don't get to diagnose or claim you know better than her doctors. Because as far as I know, you're not a doctor.", "Huge YTA I don\u2019t even think anyone should have to explain why this is wrong. It wasnt an accident.", "When and how you revealed your opinion on sisters' health makes YTA.   Your attitude would be better placed if it were about helping her instead of criticizing her.", "YTA massively. Also you\u2019ve done really well to become a qualified doctor by 21", "YTA - I am pretty sure her doctors and consultants are aware she has breast implants and explored that possibility. What are your medical qualifications? Do you really think her medical  experts are so inept that they are missing something that is visible on every x-ray and ultrasound? I mean the doctors have said it is a condition she has had since she was born and will have until she dies. \n\nAnd small chance that the surgery to fit them may have triggered the auto-immune flare - it doesn't take much, mine was triggered by a tick bite. But it could have been triggered by so many other things as well or if the implants, then triggered by a reaction the next month. She was living with a ticking time bomb. Unless the breast implants causing an active issue now, they are irrelevant to the fact she has hashimotos.\n\nA year ago, your sister was given a lifetime sentence - she was never going to be well again, she was never not going to be tired, her life would be restricted by her condition. That's a lot to process and it is natural it is going to take centre stage in her life. As to her stubbed toe, do some research on what she actually has if you care - if it is hashimotos then it affects balance because it can affect the inner ear and can make you clumsier. She's still learning how this body-wide condition is impacting her and most things will be framed in terms of it while she adjusts to a new, limited life. \n\nI get it is awful to hear someone complaining all the time especially if you don't have any compassion for the individual because you believe it is all her fault because she modified her body. \n\nAs to bringing it up in public in an attempt to shame her for feeling sick, then well you achieved your aim. You won't have to deal with her moaning around you.I suspect she'll try and avoid you annd your know-all, judgemental attitude.", "Yta... i don't even know where to start... I guess let start with her actual MEDICALLY DIAGNOSED autoimmune disease.\n\nHashimoto's disease is where your body attacks your thyroid.\n\nHashimoto's disease progresses slowly over the YEARS. You may not notice signs or symptoms of the disease. Eventually, the decline in thyroid hormone production can result in any of the following:\n\nFatigue and sluggishness\nIncreased sensitivity to cold\nIncreased sleepiness\nDry skin\nConstipation\nMuscle weakness\nMuscle aches, tenderness, and stiffness\nJoint pain and stiffness\nIrregular or excessive menstrual bleeding\nDepression\nProblems with memory or concentration\nSwelling of the thyroid (goiter)\nA puffy face\nBrittle nails\nHair loss\nEnlargement of the tongue.\n\nOp where did you get your medical degree from? What medical records of your sister did you read? How many test did you preform on your sister to rule out her autoimmune disease being the cause of your sister problems? \n\nOp you seem to have some sort of resentment over your sister's implants that you don't even care about your sister ACTUAL health.", "You are definitely the AH, massive one too. Just because you googled breast implant illness doesn\u2019t make you a doctor. Instead of blaming her breast implant why don\u2019t you Google auto immune disease and hashimoto disease. Maybe that will help you be more sympathetic to your sister. \n\n2 if she kept her breast implant secret, why TF would you share it with others. This is not your story, not your breast, not your implant. Keep your nose on your face, instead of your sisters breast.\n\n3 \u201cso yes I see how I might\u2019ve embarrassed her, but truth was gonna come out anyways\u2026 I really don\u2019t think what I did was wrong at all\u201d This was not your truth and not your place to let it out. If you really think you did nothing wrong at all even after embarrassing her then there is something clearly wrong with you. \n\n4 clearly you have issue with your sister\u2019s breast implant. And I would assume this issue comes from envy. Why can\u2019t you just be happy for her, and have empathize with her, Instead of being a bully.", "YTA, definitely wasnt your place to say anything, especially in front of family that didn\u2019t even know about the breast implants in the first place. Have you even brought it up with her privately? Definitely comes off more like you were just jealous she was getting more attention than you which is sad.", "YTA. You are not a doctor, you don't get to 'diagnose' someone based on your thoughts. You were wrong to discuss her PERSONAL medical procedure (the implants) in front of anyone, knowing that she didn't want that information shared.  While her whining, complaining and lame excuses are exhausting, that doesn't entitle ANY of your bad behaviors. You crossed a line and YOU behaved badly. You owe her a sincere apology.", "YTA...because what was your point? Whether it's her breast implants, Hashimoto's or a combination of the two, what exactly was your point? If she decided to remove the implants today she'd still feel like crap until at least 4 to 6 weeks after her removal surgery, and that's only if her autoimmune disease hasn't played a role, which as a woman with 2 chronic autoimmune diseases I seriously doubt since Hashimoto's is a big one. Have you ever been chronically ill with chronic pain to boot? People in your sisters' position have taken their lives! You have no idea what she's going through and instead of HELPING her you decided to criticize her in front of others. I know how she feels, and just because you've had an autoimmune disorder your whole life it picks and chooses when it decides to rear it's ugly head and make your life a living nightmare because they can be dormant for many years, and after that any time they ease up and seemingly go away you're considered \"in remission\" (yes, the same lingo they use for cancer patients). Mine didn't flair up and wreak havoc on my life until I was in my late 30's and if I tried to explain how it's affected my and my family's lives since then I'd begin to tear up, so I won't do that. Do you realize that even if she removed her implants and got better, her Hashimoto's could (and it will resurface at some point before she turns 40) flare back up and make her sick as a dog again? Be grateful you don't have these issues and if you don't have enough love and empathy for your sister to be able to help her, then leave her alone! I realize I don't know either of you and maybe she's been a pain in your butt before now, but she's now battling something you couldn't fathom and, like I said, if you don't wish to be of help then back off, because she has a long rode of medications, procedures, medical appointments, medical expenses and just general horrible malaise ahead of her and she doesn't have time for people who are going to act the way you've been acting...I'm sending love, prayers and positive energy your sister's way.", "YTA\n\nLet me guess, you\u2019re the type that does their own research?", "YTA\n\nIf it was breast implant illness, her doctor would\u2019ve been able to figure that out easily and tell her. So either\n\nA) You\u2019re wrong and acting like you know more than a real doctor\n\nB) You\u2019re right, she knows she has this illness and wants to keep it a secret, and you are refusing her right to keep her medical history private \n\nNo matter which option you pick, you\u2019re being an asshole", "Yta, you literally have no idea what you\u2019re talking about and how exactly was \u201cthe truth going to come out anyways\u201d about her breast implants if an asshole didn\u2019t intervene and broadcast it to the extended family? \nYou act jealous or bitter that your sister has had attention as a result of her disease.", "OP, I have Narcolepsy.

For no fucking reason other than your bs superiority complex.\n\n\nYTA\u00d7 1000.", "YTA. \n\nI have the opposite problem, an autoimmune condition called Graves disease. Whilst it's the opposite end of the spectrum, the changes in the levels of thyroid hormones are equally up and down. Doctors believe I've had the condition most of my life, but symptoms really kicked in around 3 years ago. I'm on medication every day, and that had kept it stable for a while, but they seem to need increasing as my symptoms have come back. I'm going to list just some of the symptoms in the hopes that you will see just how many things these hormones affect. \n\nChronic muscle pain\nFatigue\nInsomnia\nConstant hunger\nDramatic weight loss\nIrregular periods\nIncreased period pain\nAnxiety\nTremor\nHair loss\nTooth decay\nTachycardia\nFainting\nNausea\nDigestive issues\nMigraines\nDepression\nAn eye disorder\nA tumor on my thyroid big enough to stop me swallowing properly\nDry skin\nFertility problems \n\nI could literally go on all day. There's also the risk with both diseases (admittedly lower in Hashimotos than Graves) of thyroid storm, where your body suddenly produces more thyroxine, causing you to die with little to no warning. Unfortunately for me, graves can also cause organ failure, completely at random and without warning. Any organ could fail at any moment. \n\nThyroid disorders literally affect every single part of your body, so it's no wonder she blames most things on her illness - she's probably not far wrong! \n\nYou're not a doctor, and you don't understand what she's going through, so have a little empathy and stop being a judgemental ass.", "Except BII is a diagnosis of exclusion.

My mom has it and it has explained a lot for her. Why she's cold all the time, why she feels sick after eating gluten or why she has a stomach ache every time she eats something that has the same build as gluten. \n\nBecause when you eat gluten, you can get very sick. So if your sister gets sick, it's not because of her implants but because of Hashimoto.", "So Hashimoto\u2019s affects about 5 in 100 people in the US.

Basically her immune system is attacking her thyroid tissue for unknown reasons over time the damage can prevent your thyroid from making enough thyroid, hormone that your body needs this leads to hypothyroidism however, not everyone with Hashimoto\u2019s disease develop hypothyroidism. \n\nI have hypothyroidism, it is not fun, I eat like I have Hashimoto\u2019s. And it does help with the symptoms. I also have a chronic condition.

No? Then you don't know shit about her medical life.", "Hashimoto's disease is not serious and is easily treated with medications so I don't know why your sister is always complaining.

Not to mention the constant brain fog a depression it can cause. \n\nNow I\u2019m on levothyroxine I\u2019m kind of ok but people with hashimotos have flare ups and it can make you feel shitty. I never feel like I used to before. If she was diagnosed now it means it probably started attacking her thyroid and that why she got screened in the first place. It takes months for the medication to start working depending on whether she\u2019s hypo or hyper.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis can absolutely make a person feel very unwell in many, many ways. It causes the thyroid to go back and forth between being overactive and underactive. The thyroid controls the metabolism and has a small role in immunity to disease. So, yeah, having Hashimoto's can cause everything you're sister is experiencing. (My best friend in childhood had a thyroid condition, my aunt survived thyroid cancer and now lives with no thyroid, and I am a vet tech and thyroid conditions are among the most common chronic illnesses in dogs and cats. I know my thyroids)\n\nAdditionally, a stressful event like recovering from surgery can trigger an autoimmune condition to become apparent. Which doesn't mean her implants are making her sick, just that having a surgery, regardless of what surgery, might have caused her latent autoimmune condition to become symptomatic.

Issues with the immune system can affect many other body systems. Furthermore, many of these disorders are not well understood. The medical field has come a long way, but there is still quite a bit of funding and research needed in these areas before we will have a cure for many of these chronic conditions. My condition was once believed to be fake until research caught up. People who live with chronic pain/illness are also more likely to live with depression and deal with suicidal thoughts. \n\nAlso, breast implant illness is not a recognized diagnosis.
