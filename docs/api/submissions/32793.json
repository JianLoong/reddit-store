I dress I'm very bright dresses and wear very bright makeup so I think she assumes I'm rich, I'm not and this salary is barely enough to get through a month without the luxury of my parents still letting me live with them (I'm 21). I told her sure and that I'll have a look. A lot of my clothing are hand me downs from the boyfriends mom. I forgot and the next day she came to me and I said I forgot due to long hours and I'll try again. Well- I forgot again. I get home late, exhausted everyday and I know she does too. When I told her that I forgot, she glared at me and shook her arms in a way to say \"are you serious?\" And walked away. Now I don't want to give her the clothes anymore due to that attitude she gave me. My thoughts are that if you are desperate for clothing from someone, especially who also works 9-5, that you'll be respectful of the fact that they're even willing to give them to you. She's going to expect them this morning and I feel guilty to give her the news.\n\nAITA for changing my mind?\n\nEdit: Another commenter suggested I just do a very quick rummage and give her just a few clothing items. I never want to be petty and that most likely explains my guilt. Before I left for work I found about 5 clothing items to give her. I would've initially done a deep dive, but due to her attitude and also the time I had this morning, I decided to give her the first things I saw. I will update on her response when I give to her and I hope it's a positive one ", "created_utc": 1702271826, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fn1td/aita_for_not_giving_my_spare_clothes_i_dont_wear/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She shouldn't have an attitude and you said you would. If you had said the first time you forgot that you had looked and didn't find anything, or that you were sorry but you don't have anything for her, that would have been fine.  But telling someone tomorrow, tomorrow, actually forget it is on the rude side.", "NTA. Only you can decide if and who to give your belongings to. If she has ann issue with that, she has an issue respecting other people's boundaries.", "ESH.  \nWhen she asked and you said yes, there was a verbal agreement that this deal had been made. She's already in a poor position and her pushiness indicates that this is kind of a big deal to her. She sucks since she's giving you attitude when you're doing her a favour, but you suck since you reacted to her impatience by taking away the items that she's impatient for. That's so petty. If you don't want her hounding you for clothes, just say you don't have it. Then when you're feeling generous and have the free time, go through your wardrobe and actually see if you have anything to spare to her grandkid. Give it to her on your own time and she'll probably be thankful.", "ESH you should have set a reminder the first time you forgot, she should chill out. If you don't want to give her any clothes you don't have to, but you gotta tell her that. \n\nUnrelated but have you ever been to a clothing swap? It's a fun way to switch up your wardrobe for free or very, very cheap. Both you and the cleaning lady at your work might enjoy them.", "Esh. It makes sense that you're annoyed by her attitude.  You dont owe her anything but 2 days in a row is thoughtless of you. \n\nShe probably thinks you're doing it on purpose. Some people are intentionally \"forgetful\" just to mess with people in need. She's wrong, but i see how she thinks it's a power play from you", "NTA. I would've reacted the same way. I am all for helping others if I can, but if someone acts entitled to my help or behaves the way this lady seemingly did, all desire to help disappears from my body.", "ESH\n\n\nDon't tell someone you're going to do something if you are going to put 0 effort into actually doing it, especially after you've already forgotten twice. \n\nHer reaction was kind of rude, but is she just meant to ask you every day? If she told her granddaughter that she had arranged to get her new clothes, then she would become the unreliable one to her granddaughter, which would suck because she has no control over it. \n\n\nYTA for not giving her the clothes because she got a little frustrated when you forgot 2 days in a row. Seems like a reasonable reaction to when someone says they will do something and they don't.", "NTA. She approached you asking for something. You didn't just shut her down, you were amenable to her request. You are allowed some leeway on the timeline. She shouldn't give you attitude because you didn't prioritize curating your wardrobe to give stuff to her at her request.", "NTA! Tell her you had a look, there\u2019s nothing to donate at this time. You\u2019ll think of her next year when you try again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Again, late nights working so it kept on slipping so I feel guilty for that and acknowledge it. But that attitude just put me off. She could've reacted with \"I understand, please do try to remember today\" Then it's totally cool, but the way she reacted was just a little, idk if the word entitled is appropriate?", "I feel the guilt coz I initially said yes, yah know? Then, practically put it off for two days (forgetting) and now saying no. I just feel so bad", "Your opinion is appreciated- another commenter suggested I just do a very quick rummage and give her just a few clothing items.

Thank you for your honest input and I have added an edit to this post about my plan", "Ah, thank you for the reassurance of knowing someone else would feel the same way. I thought I'm being petty but I guess not?", "It's completely understandable, and I really value your honesty. I'm not sure if you saw the edit to my post, but I've managed to collect some clothing for her", "She shouldn't have acted like that.  You should just bring her something since you thought you could and then forget about it.  Tell her. No the next time she asks because there will be one.", "You don't need to feel guilty.  There's no way this lady's granddaughter wants some random clothes that her grandma bummed off a lady at work. \n\nPeople have their own clothing styles and it seems unlikely that your clothes will be suited for a particular person just because their grandma likes the style.  \n\nI think it would be ok to say \"Sorry, I looked through my clothes and I didn't find anything that I wanted to get rid of\"", "Totally understand that feeling. And if it gets too much, give what you want to. But don't feel guilted or harrassed into it.", "Yeah, I think five items of clothing is great! You didn't promise her a certain amount or anything, just that you'd take a look. I'm sure any amount you give her is appreciated.", "That's awesome. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\nHopefully, she'll be grateful and not stay salty. If not, then at least you might have made her granddaughter's day a bit better. \n\n\nIn hindsight, your post did read more like a very tired person just not wanting to deal with someone's negativity, especially someone who should be more understanding of being tired after work. \n\n\nI'm going to thank you for putting in that effort in the morning and bringing her the clothes in case she doesn't. It was a very kind thing of you to do :)", "Good idea, my mom says I shouldn't because if someone isn't respectful, they don't deserve it, whether things are forgotten or not.", "People who are very poor may not have this kind of choices. Being able to buy clothes in the style one prefers is a luxury some people do not enjoy.  Not giving clothes you committed to provide to an impoverished woman who thinks her granddaughter would enjoy your style so the granddaughter can develop her personal fashion sense is mired in privilege-bound ignorance.", "I hope she does appreciate it", "That's an opinion.  I try to keep my word and she didn't. Cuss you out or anything.", "Yah yah I get you"]}
