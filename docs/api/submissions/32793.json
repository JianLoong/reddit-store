I never want to be petty and that most likely explains my guilt. Before I left for work I found about 5 clothing items to give her.

I will update on her response when I give to her and I hope it's a positive one \n\nEdit 2: She took a look at them and thanked me. I told her that I donated my other clothing to charity a few months back, so I didn't have much to give, which isn't a lie.

IT'S NOT A LONG WORK DAY IT'S A NORMAL ONE, ALSO WHY DO YOU THINK YOU DRESSING IN BRIGHT COLORS LOOKING LIKE A CLOWN CORRELATES INTO YOU BEING RICH. HAHAHAH YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE NEXT TIME DON'T TELL SOMEONE YOU WILL DO SOMETHING THEN DON'T AND THEN GET UPSET BC THEY ARE UPSET THAT YOU ARE A LYING LOSER", "NTA. You said you'd do something and you forgot. This was clearly important to you as you felt bad. In the future, though, maybe don't put a timeline on stuff or give yourself more leeway.\n\nYou're busy and youre exhausted when you get home and you need the rest. If she's impatient, fuck her, she can wait. I wouldn't continue to want to be kind to someone if they got upset with me for not doing it on their terms.", "NTA, but just something to add, hope the OP sees this. If you regularly work late and don't have much time at home, think about agreeing to something after the weekend and set an alarm notification on your phone. \n\nThat way it gives you more time during the weekend or your days off to actually focus on a task for someone else. It would help you avoid this entire situation.", "NTA, but you should have stuck to your guns. Rewarding her entitlement to your property will encourage her to do it again, to you and others.", "Use it as a learning experience. Sadly this is very common.", "She was never entitled to clothes to begin with, but she asked and you agreed. You then forgot twice, man, so naturally she just assumes you lied and have zero intention of giving her clothing.\n\nAlmost N A H but her asking was tacky and you forgetting several times is also tacky. So maybe no one's an asshole here, but equally tacky.", "Esh look I get that this woman was rude for asking but I don't think it's unreasonable to be annoyed when someone said they would do something and then they forget twice. The fact of the matter is you said yes to this task. I also don't know your exact wording but by saying you forgot when she asks you are agreeing that an appropriate turn around time for this task is a day. Like had you only remembered it could have easily been done in a day. From your perspective you think she should be respectful and patient but from hers it could look like you are giving her thr run around. She might be wondering if you were ever going to do or if you are the type who just says yes and doesn't follow through. \n\nSo for starters you should have said no. But the first time she  asked you could have given her a timeline. Like \"I have a lot going on this week  so I don't have time to check after work. I'll check some stuff out and bring it to you Monday\".", "NTA. What kinda of person goes up to an individual IN A WORKPLACE and asks them if they have any spare clothes they can have?? INAPPROPRIATE.", "Who goes to their work and asks for clothes donations???   NTA if you had said no.", "NTA\n\nPeople who come to me begging at work get on my last nerve.  We are not friends, we just work at the same place. If they had given me attitude about it 1 day later I would not have bothered donating a damn thing.", "NTA. Don\u2019t be a doormat. She got an attitude. You didn\u2019t owe her anything. Speak up for yourself and say no.", "Also, someone this bold is probably going to bug her for more donations in the future. She picked a young girl for a reason. If this happens again, OP needs to mention this to HR. Creating awkwardness at work is not good.", "Yeah, I know that was dumb of me, but it was a guilt response that I just blurted out so that she wouldn't be upset that I gave her so little - I'm dumb man", "I totally understand how some folks could see OP as being rude, as she did promise to look. But on the part of the other woman, she was literally acting as though her granddaughter - who OP has most likely never even met or knows anything about - is central on her mind. Yes, she's tired and has other stuff to do once she's home from work. It's easy to see that while Grandma is hugely concerned about her granddaughter's wellbeing, OP isn't. And that's ok. She was asked for a favor and she would do it, regardless of whether it took an extra day or two.", "OP says she's 21 - I assumed the granddaughter is a teen, so they would likely have some similar clothing likes.", "Are you sure about that? To whom am I inherently indebted?", "She said many of her clothes were hand-me-downs from her bf's mom.   I assume at least some of these are the ones that she'd be donating.  It's just so difficult to know whether their clothing styles would match, whether the granddaughter would want or appreciate these clothes.  I know that neither of my grandmothers understand my fashion sense.  They have a *very* different idea of the things that would \"look good on me\".  \n\nI wouldn't discourage OP from giving away clothes she doesn't want, but I don't think there needs to be any sense of obligation here.  The clothes may or may not be appreciated/used.  It's impossible to know without further information.", "No, you don't expect them to ask again the next day. You expect them to be patient. ETA: That said, responding with \"I'll see what I can do\" is the better approach, as it doesn't come with a timeline.", "Personally, I wouldn\u2019t ask again. If I\u2019m asking for donations especially clothing and someone said they would do it. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to go home and sort it out that day. Also if they didn\u2019t, I would leave it assuming they didn\u2019t want to give it away."]}
