{"id": 32793, "submission_id": "18fn1td", "title": "AITA for not giving my spare clothes I don't wear to the companies cleaning lady?", "selftext": "So one of the companies cleaning ladies came up to me asking if I have spare clothes to give her for her granddaughter. I dress I'm very bright dresses and wear very bright makeup so I think she assumes I'm rich, I'm not and this salary is barely enough to get through a month without the luxury of my parents still letting me live with them (I'm 21). I told her sure and that I'll have a look. A lot of my clothing are hand me downs from the boyfriends mom. I forgot and the next day she came to me and I said I forgot due to long hours and I'll try again. Well- I forgot again. I get home late, exhausted everyday and I know she does too. When I told her that I forgot, she glared at me and shook her arms in a way to say \"are you serious?\" And walked away. Now I don't want to give her the clothes anymore due to that attitude she gave me. My thoughts are that if you are desperate for clothing from someone, especially who also works 9-5, that you'll be respectful of the fact that they're even willing to give them to you. She's going to expect them this morning and I feel guilty to give her the news.\n\nAITA for changing my mind?\n\nEdit: Another commenter suggested I just do a very quick rummage and give her just a few clothing items. I never want to be petty and that most likely explains my guilt. Before I left for work I found about 5 clothing items to give her. I would've initially done a deep dive, but due to her attitude and also the time I had this morning, I decided to give her the first things I saw. I will update on her response when I give to her and I hope it's a positive one \n\nEdit 2: She took a look at them and thanked me. I told her that I donated my other clothing to charity a few months back, so I didn't have much to give, which isn't a lie. I told her that if I find more I'll give them to her", "created_utc": 1702271826, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fn1td/aita_for_not_giving_my_spare_clothes_i_dont_wear/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She shouldn't have an attitude and you said you would. If you had said the first time you forgot that you had looked and didn't find anything, or that you were sorry but you don't have anything for her, that would have been fine.  But telling someone tomorrow, tomorrow, actually forget it is on the rude side.", "NTA. Only you can decide if and who to give your belongings to. If she has ann issue with that, she has an issue respecting other people's boundaries.", "ESH.  \nWhen she asked and you said yes, there was a verbal agreement that this deal had been made. She's already in a poor position and her pushiness indicates that this is kind of a big deal to her. She sucks since she's giving you attitude when you're doing her a favour, but you suck since you reacted to her impatience by taking away the items that she's impatient for. That's so petty. If you don't want her hounding you for clothes, just say you don't have it. Then when you're feeling generous and have the free time, go through your wardrobe and actually see if you have anything to spare to her grandkid. Give it to her on your own time and she'll probably be thankful.", "ESH you should have set a reminder the first time you forgot, she should chill out. If you don't want to give her any clothes you don't have to, but you gotta tell her that. \n\nUnrelated but have you ever been to a clothing swap? It's a fun way to switch up your wardrobe for free or very, very cheap. Both you and the cleaning lady at your work might enjoy them.", "Esh. It makes sense that you're annoyed by her attitude.  You dont owe her anything but 2 days in a row is thoughtless of you. \n\nShe probably thinks you're doing it on purpose. Some people are intentionally \"forgetful\" just to mess with people in need. She's wrong, but i see how she thinks it's a power play from you", "NTA. I would've reacted the same way. I am all for helping others if I can, but if someone acts entitled to my help or behaves the way this lady seemingly did, all desire to help disappears from my body.", "ESH\n\n\nDon't tell someone you're going to do something if you are going to put 0 effort into actually doing it, especially after you've already forgotten twice. \n\nHer reaction was kind of rude, but is she just meant to ask you every day? If she told her granddaughter that she had arranged to get her new clothes, then she would become the unreliable one to her granddaughter, which would suck because she has no control over it. \n\n\nYTA for not giving her the clothes because she got a little frustrated when you forgot 2 days in a row. Seems like a reasonable reaction to when someone says they will do something and they don't.", "NTA. She approached you asking for something. You didn't just shut her down, you were amenable to her request. You are allowed some leeway on the timeline. She shouldn't give you attitude because you didn't prioritize curating your wardrobe to give stuff to her at her request.", "NTA! Tell her you had a look, there\u2019s nothing to donate at this time. You\u2019ll think of her next year when you try again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Again, late nights working so it kept on slipping so I feel guilty for that and acknowledge it. But that attitude just put me off. She could've reacted with \"I understand, please do try to remember today\" Then it's totally cool, but the way she reacted was just a little, idk if the word entitled is appropriate?", "I feel the guilt coz I initially said yes, yah know?

I thought I'm being petty but I guess not?", "It's completely understandable, and I really value your honesty. I'm not sure if you saw the edit to my post, but I've managed to collect some clothing for her", "She shouldn't have acted like that.  You should just bring her something since you thought you could and then forget about it.  Tell her. No the next time she asks because there will be one.", "You don't need to feel guilty.  There's no way this lady's granddaughter wants some random clothes that her grandma bummed off a lady at work. \n\nPeople have their own clothing styles and it seems unlikely that your clothes will be suited for a particular person just because their grandma likes the style.  \n\nI think it would be ok to say \"Sorry, I looked through my clothes and I didn't find anything that I wanted to get rid of\"", "Totally understand that feeling. And if it gets too much, give what you want to. But don't feel guilted or harrassed into it.", "Yeah, I think five items of clothing is great! You didn't promise her a certain amount or anything, just that you'd take a look. I'm sure any amount you give her is appreciated.", "That's awesome. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\nHopefully, she'll be grateful and not stay salty. If not, then at least you might have made her granddaughter's day a bit better. \n\n\nIn hindsight, your post did read more like a very tired person just not wanting to deal with someone's negativity, especially someone who should be more understanding of being tired after work. \n\n\nI'm going to thank you for putting in that effort in the morning and bringing her the clothes in case she doesn't. It was a very kind thing of you to do :)", "Good idea, my mom says I shouldn't because if someone isn't respectful, they don't deserve it, whether things are forgotten or not.", "People who are very poor may not have this kind of choices. Being able to buy clothes in the style one prefers is a luxury some people do not enjoy.  Not giving clothes you committed to provide to an impoverished woman who thinks her granddaughter would enjoy your style so the granddaughter can develop her personal fashion sense is mired in privilege-bound ignorance.", "I hope she does appreciate it", "That's an opinion.  I try to keep my word and she didn't. Cuss you out or anything.", "Yah yah I get you", "Make sure you state this is a ONE TIME THING. \n\nNta", "YTA. The woman needs clothes for a child, you agreed to give her some, now you\u2019re going to deprive a kid of clothes because of her attitude? An attitude that was justified, I might add, when you failed to do what you said you\u2019d do. Get over yourself. Do you also expect her to fall to her knees with gratitude when you hand over your few paltry items? If she doesn\u2019t, will you take them back? She\u2019s clearly in a dire situation if she\u2019s asking strangers for donations. Either provide the help you agreed to or accept the fact you\u2019re an AH.", "NTA. If someone says they\u2019ll have a look, I would never assume or expect them to do it immediately. Her attitude was unwarranted.", "NTA It is extremely unprofessional of her to ask for your belongings. I would have fired her. If she feels entitled to your belongings she will have zero problem helping herself to them.\n\nMy mom is a house cleaner. She has never and would never ask someone to have their belongings. Again, extremely unprofessional and rude! Now if someone said \"Hey, I have a bag I am taking to goodwill would you like to look through it?\" Nothing wrong with that. But you do NOT ask/demand other people's belongings!!", "NTA for feeling annoyed at someone who is huffy with you while asking for a favor. I would consider this an opportunity to get rid of excess items I don\u2019t need to store.", "NTA. But you probably should not have told her you will in the future. Now she will pester you all the time.", "I have a similar situation and I give all my and my daughters clothes we don\u2019t not want any longer to a group of girls. I am very into clothes and they get a lot of nice things. The women I give them to has done things that I would rethink my decision but in the end the girls get them and they are so happy. I\u2019d say give them if you want. I maybe do it for selfish reasons. It makes me feel good that the girls get so so excited by our stuff.", "NTA. I get why she might be a little frustrated, but come on, it's something she's not owed. She shouldn't be glaring at you lol I wouldn't want to give her the clothes either. I would still give her, obviously it's needed and I don't need them, but I won't be happy about it. Nobody deserves to be given an attitude for that. I have a pretty bad memory so sometimes I do this to people and I always apologize a lot for it, because it's bad manners to promise something and forget to fulfill it, but the attitude was unnecessary", "NTA. She asked a stranger for a favor and then got mad and entitled when she didn't receive said favor in just 2 days time? It'd probably take me a month to get my shit together and get her the clothes.\nI'd probably tell her a day after her \"are you serious\" that I looked and didn't have anything to spare. It might be petty but who the hell asks for charity and then acts like it's their god given right? She was rude and inappropriate. Sure, you said you'd give her some so she expected it, but people have lives, are busy, are tired, have other priorities - and she expected you to go home and instantly rummage through your closet for her.", "NTA but saying you would check during the weekend would give you more time. I'm not saying give your clothes, as I find her approach really unprofessional and later on rude.", "Some random cleaning lady asked you for clothes?? WOW I'm not sure how I would feel about that. Just asking for clothes? I'm confused, your cleaning lady? Who does this stuff?", "The entitlement so many are manifesting really sucks. YTA OP for not helping out someone in need. What do you want her to do? Grovel and say thank you milady? They're old clothes. You're not buying her Dior are you!?", "Thank you for your comment! I actually had said to her \"I'm so sorry, I've been getting home late so I've completely forgotten as I am exhausted\" I said that on both occasions and she reacted as stated the last time", "WRONG. NTA she got impatient cause she thinks she\u2019s owed those clothes when she\u2019s not owed anything. I doubt her child won\u2019t have anything to wear just cause OP didn\u2019t give her anything. There\u2019s an old saying about not biting the hand tht feeds you.", "Hard disagree. OP is NTA.She didn't say tomorrow, the person decided tomorrow. You ask for someone to do a time consuming task as a favour, you at least wait for a weekend to pass before you pester them.", "I'll bring it in once work stabilizes\" would have cut off any fuel for her to continue being nasty to you.", "We found the entitled ass folks", "I heavily appreciate your honesty- except for the harsh assumptions of me as a person, I would NEVER act like that nor even think that way. I added an edit to the post of what had occurred.", "NTA Its thoughtless of her to assume OP doesn\u2019t have her own life to live and issues to deal with. Bet you anything if OP said no from the start she STILL would have given attitude.", "But\u2026you DID act and think that way. You decided her attitude was more important than the deep dive you would\u2019ve done if she wasn\u2019t more respectful (your word). I appreciate that you\u2019re under no obligation to give this woman anything. But you agreed to do so, now you\u2019ve held back because she wasn\u2019t respectful enough. Maybe the child had a special school recital and she was disappointed not to have new clothes for the child. Maybe she\u2019s not a very nice person. But her attitude seems a pretty petty reason not to honour  your agreement to donate clothes to a child.", "I'm sorry, I've got to disagree.  There's absolutely no guarantee that the granddaughter wants or needs these clothes.  Or even that they're in her size.  \n\nI don't think it necessary to accuse anyone of ignorance.  I am *very* well acquainted with poverty.   I've had my share of secondhand clothes that were given to me.  The good majority of these clothes, I never wore.  I would rather wear a few clothing items that truly suited me than to have tons of clothes that weren't quite right.  Moreover, I would be horrified if I found out my grandma had been asking people for some of their clothes to give to me. \n\n If OP has clothes that she's planning to donate, sure, might as well pass them along to someone she knows.   I don't think she needs to feel any guilt or obligation in this situation."]}
