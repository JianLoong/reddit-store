{"id": 8783, "submission_id": "10q2hw4", "title": "AITA for not taking my boyfriend to help his mom?", "selftext": "I (19F) have a boyfriend (22M) who I\u2019ll just call P that lives with me. Last night, he gets a call from his mom asking if he could come over to help her get up because she was hurting and couldn\u2019t. She told him it was okay if he couldn\u2019t, and said at least she isn\u2019t on the floor. He muted the phone call the ask if I could take him (he doesn\u2019t drive.) I was in pain myself, I had lifted something I shouldn\u2019t have and hurt my back. My car is also almost empty and it has to last me until the end of the week when I get paid. On top of that, it was raining ice (already covering roads) and dark and I am scared to drive in that kind of weather. I explained all of this to him, and said I\u2019d like to but it just wasn\u2019t a good time. I understand his mom did need help, but she told it would be okay if he couldn\u2019t and she could wait for people to get home. \n\n(A little side story, his mother never reacts good to being told no. You could tell her yes to something 5 times in a row then decide to say no the 6th time and she\u2019d get mad.) My boyfriend got upset with me, saying it was horrible I wouldn\u2019t go, etc. which made me feel terrible, but I was hurting and scared to drive, as well as low on gas. His mom texted him telling him not to text, call, visit, etc. She is still acting the same today. She told him she is done with him and me, and she\u2019s not going to ask us for anything. \n\nI told him I\u2019m going to continue saying no because I\u2019m not in favor for helping someone who reacts that way when they are told no. I just can\u2019t shake the feeling maybe I was in the wrong because she was in pain and couldn\u2019t get up. If I had a full tank a gas and felt fine, I would\u2019ve went. My boyfriend admitted he over reacted and did apologize to me. \n\nI do just feel bad, AITA?\n\nEDIT: He did ask her if she could order an uber for him to get there because all he had was cash. She didn\u2019t. She ended up going to the ER. He was able to figure out a way for someone to send her $10 so she\u2019d have a way back home. She still isn\u2019t wanting to talk to him though. He did message her last night to check up on her and stuff.", "created_utc": 1675180356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10q2hw4/aita_for_not_taking_my_boyfriend_to_help_his_mom/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Point blank. \n\nIf you live in a place where driving is a necessity and can\u2019t drive, you can\u2019t expect everyone else to be your taxi. I\u2019ll never understand grown adult people who never bother to get their license. Your boyfriend at least needs a license so he can take your car himself if the situation is that dire.", "NTA. Your boyfriend needs to learn to drive if he\u2019s expecting to ever help his mother again.  You\u2019re setting yourself up to always be the bad guy if it will always be on you to drive him when she needs him.  It won\u2019t get easier as his mom ages.", "NTA  did your boyfriend or his mother even offer to pay for gas? And can't he take a bus or something?", "NAH. Mom gave him the out. And since you were legitimately hurt, and he can\u2019t drive, it gives him due reason to utilize the \u201cout\u201d she gave. \n\nIf she was truly in dire need, she would/should have communicated that, but did not.\n\n**That said, he should get his license. At his age, and if his mom has health problems, he needs to suck it up and go test.** (Unless there\u2019s a medical issue.)", "NTA - if his mom needs him at her beck and call, tell her to set up an Uber account with her CC as a backup in case you can't drive.  He could have called a cab and got cash from his mom after the fact.  There's plenty of ways he could have helped that didn't affect you so drastically.   \n You can't dictate his relationship with his mom.. until it affects you.  This is one of those cases.  I'm sorry, leaving out everything else... you were injured!!!  It's not safe to drive with a bad back, if it spasmed while you were driving you could get into an accident.", "nta, you were concerned about your own safety (rightfully so, ice on the road is dangerous) plus dealing with your own injury. nobody seemingly offered to pay for gas which you need to last for a while. you're a teenager and this is an adult man with no license and barring some sort of medical issue or disability he should get that sorted if he has a mom with a tendency to require help from him.", "NTA. \n\nYour reasons are understandable. I would've suggested if he paid for gas, then I'd do it. But if you don't have the gas or money on top of also being in pain, I understand your decision to say no.\n\nHowever, it is an unfortunate situation and I feel bad for his mom also. I can't imagine being stuck and unable to move for who knows how long. Not sure what her condition is, but she may need round the clock care because this could become life threatening if she's left alone and unable to move her own body. \n\nI'd show her you care and try to come up with a solution to make everyone happy and safe but that's just my suggestion.", "NTA. Good for him for apologizing. Good for you to set boundaries.", "NTA, it was a safety and financial issue, you made the best decision you could. \n\nAlso seriously consider if this guy is worth dealing with a controlling and manipulative parent like that. It sounds like she doesn\u2019t live alone and was testing you and your bf to see if you would drop everything for her. \n\nMy ex-MIL was exactly the same, would cry, yell, and completely ignore me or my ex if he did something she didn\u2019t want him to do. And she would try and manipulate him into believing all of her issues were my fault somehow. It never got better and he consistently chose her bullshit over our relationship.", "NTA. It's great that you're willing to help sometimes, but you aren't even married. His mother is not your responsibility. \n\nYou had so many valid reasons to not go, but unless you were maliciously doing so, even just saying no with no reason wouldn't have made you TA.", "NAH. \n\nHe was understandably worried about his mom who clearly had some form of injury.\n\nHowever, you were also hurt and there was a concern around road safety. \n\nYou were in a no-win situation.", "NTA, sounds like you both sorted it", "ESH: Your boyfriend for not being able to drive.

It isn't like she was really in trouble or you just didn't want to go, she treated it like it wasn't really a big deal and you had very real reasons not to go. Keep an eye on his mother, though, if she responds like this to not getting her way. That's not a good sign.", "NTA, Whatever.\n\nBut understand this problem doesn't go away tomorrow.  It doesn't go away when you move to a new place.
