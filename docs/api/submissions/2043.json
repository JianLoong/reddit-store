The Star Wars clubs joined forces and created a beautiful display for Comicon that resembled the Most Eisley Cantina, with a bar, mannequins dressed as aliens and individual booths for photos so the attendees could have a great time.\n\nI remember one day, a woman cosplaying as Metal Bikini Leia showed up with a photographer and a lighting guy and wanted to use our area for her own personal photoshoot, while holding up other people who wanted to check out the displays. Some older members of the clubs had to go to them and politely tell them they needed to \"move along\". They didn't seem happy, but the displays are for EVERYONE to enjoy and take pictures, but not to hold up the line because of someone's ego.", "I'm surprised by the #of votes in this thread but I wanted to say this is really cute and what a fun set to make. I bet a lot of people enjoyed the Cantina.", "The reason that isn\u2019t always a good option is one: lighting (VERY IMPORTANT) and two: seeing the bride or groom before the ceremony is still seen as bad luck (not that important if you ask me, but I digress) \nOf course the lighting doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a week in advance lol but there is a type of shoot that is taken that early. There are just a bunch of different versions of shoots to fit everyone\u2019s unique needs and schedules", "You could easily schedule a photo shoot with appropriate lighting, at least if the bridal party is local. And seriously, the groom has seen the bride \u2014 most likely, everything there is to see. If people want to maintain the fiction/superstition, that's fine, but they need to understand the need to balance their wish for 10,000 photos with their obligation to greet their guests.", "I do that kind of thing all the time. I was walking through the city and this couple and blocked off where I wanted to go into so they could take romantic snaps and when they saw I was trying to enter they asked if I could walk around and take the side entrance.\n\nNo thanks, I walked right in", "I wouldn\u2019t say day after shoots but there is a thing called post wedding shoots and you can book it to be done so say people who don\u2019t have much time between ceremony and reception for photos and book a photographer to go to locations you couldn\u2019t on the day. Some people wait weeks to get it done though day after would be exhausting", "It\u2019s just a personal thing. Maybe you want pictures at the local rose garden and need to book a slot and the only free one is the day before or after. Maybe it\u2019s pissing down rain. Maybe you\u2019re getting married on Sunday afternoon and everyone has to fly out the next morning before 9 and you\u2019d rather mingle than do a photoshoot. There\u2019s a bunch of reasons why you might take your pictures one a different day that don\u2019t make it automatically cringeworthy. It\u2019s how you behave while you\u2019re doing it that makes it AH behavior, like OP\u2019s encounter.", "NTA they want the table book it and buy food. Good lord some people are entitled.", "They interrupted YOUR big day. They are so entitled. They should have stopped after the first no. \n\nYou had your meal. Assuming it was not cheap. Why would you stop enjoying the time you paid for for your enjoyment so they could have something from free? I\u2019m", "I don\u2019t think this was worthy of basically handing someone around $100. \n\nNobody got hurt, nobody lost anything. Manager should have stepped in slightly earlier but this interaction was not his fault and shouldn\u2019t cost his business money.", "\"You're running my wedding decade\"", "It would be different I suppose if food wasn\u2019t in the table.  Otherwise NTA.  Weird of photographer to even ask", "NTA and you know you\u2019re in the right if the manager backs you up. As he said, why would he allow this couple to shoot at the restaurant for free while disturbing paying customers?? Usually restaurants have \u201cdowntime\u201d such as in between lunch and dinner, or even earlier if it\u2019s only a dinner restaurant. I\u2019m sure they could have found a different time to do that, and also paid to rent for the shoot. People are WILD.", "NTA.... they should have planned ahead and called the restaurant to make arrangements beforehand. Geez, the overwhelming sense of entitlement with people these days is overwhelming. Ugh!", "NTA\n\nI can understand wanting to get special pics for a special day, but you're already eating. If they were smart about it, they could have asked the manager or whoever that after you and your friend were done, they could get in real quick to take some quick shots after the table has been cleared.\n\nSucks to suck, but hopefully they'll learn to plan better next time they do something like that.", "NTA. All they had to do was wait until you were finished eating! Why was that so hard? Weirdos.", "Some people are so self absorbed that they don\u2019t realize what assholes they are. I never heard of a day after wedding shoot that apparently happens with little or no notice. \u201c Let\u2019s bother a bunch of strangers to make us feel special\u201d I give the marriage less than a year!", "What kind of upscale restaurant is allowing their patrons to be interrupted and harassed during their meal? I would have escalated this up to the GM, absolutely inexcusable.", "Wth photoshop exisits", "NTA, if it was that important to them they could've come back after you'd left.  15 minutes is a long time to be uprooted from your table because these rockstars didn't plan ahead.  I'm hearing you say that spare tables weren't really appropriate in size, these people are being inappropriate in expecting you to accept being interrupted while your food cools so they can pose by this special table.  The fact that all three of them chorused the same crying and bullying speaks to them being out of line and has nothing to do with you and your perfect right to be undisturbed during your meal, the fact that the owner supported you in this decision speaks volumes.", "I actually don't understand why the manager didn't step in long before and let them bother you and the other patrons.  So, the manager gets a few \"asshole\" points, too.\n\nIf they wanted it so badly, reserve the table or arrange to come in before opening (though if it's that popular a spot, they might decide it's not worth the trouble.)\n\nYou're NTA, the entitled and rude couple are.", "NTA - you were mid meal. That's some major entitlement on their part.", "The management should have escorted them right off the premises the moment they walked in.", "NTA \n\nIf the booth was that special to them that it would \u2018ruin the day after her wedding\u2019, then why didn\u2019t they speak with the restaurant to reserve it? They do know that no one owes them anything and while they are welcome to ask, throwing a tantrum when they get denied is extremely childish, right?", "Maybe it's been said but I think that it's odd that a restaurant this nice or well known would have let them in and they would have been allowed to harrass paying customers.  The couple is garbage but I'd be pissed to go out for a nice meal and have that to deal with during my meal.", "NTA. You can't just go into business and not purchase anything and expect any sort of accommodation. I bet if they had actually dined at the restaurant the staff would be willing to help out. It has to be so frustrating working at a place like this and having to deal with shit like this by people who aren't even paying customers. Even going to the management of the business you are not patronizing? That's a level of entitlement I can't wrap my brain around. I am sorry you were put into such an awkward situation. I've never heard of a \"day after photoshoot\" and it sounds kind of ridiculous imo. Go on your honeymoon ffs.  It sounds like they weren't willing to let go of their special day yet.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nGood on you, your friend, and the restaurant manager for not backing down from folks that were too blinded by their entitlement to realize that they were being entitled ass clowns.", "NTA. Entitlements! It's the day after the wedding? Even odds a year from now they'll be divorcing. When faced with bridezillas, tell them to come back on their 50th anniversary and you'll think about it.\n\nClearly the restaurant owner wasn't on their team either.", " TA. Your food was on the table. Where was it going to go? The floor? They could have waited until you were done & the table was bussed.", "NTA. If it was *that* important to them to get a photo at that table then they should have called ahead and booked the table for that time. Serious entitlement on their behalf!", "NTA\n\nI'm kinda thinking that if this ever happens to me I will just lick the booth while maintaining eye contact.\n\n\"This booth is mine.\" \n\nThey will either be too grossed out or terrified to continue asking.", "Fuck that couple.  If they wanted it so bad they should have paid for your meals.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "I'm going to start shaming people that don't give me what I want, whenever I want it.\n\n\"You're being mean to me, and you are ruining this day for me! I was just married 6,320 days ago!\" *sob sob*", "Nta. They should have planned better. Something similar happened to me years ago while I was on a date. We were at a pretty packed restaurant and around 15 people celebrating a birthday got there expecting to all be seated together without a reservation. The hostess sat them at two tables that were close but not right next to each other so they wanted my date and i moved mid meal so they could sit together. The hostess refused but a girl kept coming over asking us to move. We declined, it was so rude. Had they offered to buy me a drink maybe I would have considered it.", "NTA. Why would I let my paid meal to get cold to accommodate other non-paying ppl? If they want it that bad, they better wait till I\u2019m done eating. Or they should have showed up before me and paid for the table themselves \ud83d\ude1c", "NTA. Never heard of a day after shoot. What\u2019s the point? Fake memories??", "Totally NTA. Banish these selfish idiots from your mind. \nPeople stink.", "NTA. So let me get this straight, THEY came into a popular restaurant when there where a lot of people in there, don\u2019t pay and start taking pictures probably with a professional photographer with a camera that flash\u2019s. They didn\u2019t order food. They come up to you and ask you to move for 15 minutes, not even offering to help you move your stuff. Then get mad at you. I would\u2019ve moved if it was 5 minutes but, 15 ??? that\u2019s like the entire time you spend at a restaurant. They probably where expecting you to give them the food to for the aesthetics. Also this restaurant sound fancy enough to have Renovations you and your friend shouldn\u2019t have been expected to move. Also having a photoshoot in a busy restaurant like what there are waiters and waitresses giving people there food there so rude.", "I\u2019m a wedding photographer and I\u2019m often in public areas taking photos. Wouldn\u2019t dream of asking people to move. Especially when the people are paying customers. Even in a public park I won\u2019t disturb others. I find often people volunteer to move or step out of the way\u2026but if they don\u2019t \u2026 that\u2019s ok. That photographer makes it hard on other photographers\u2026 as who is to say the owner of the restaurant decides no more photos allowed.", "NTA. They probably could have set something up with the restaurant if they'd called, and if this particular photo was THAT important to them, they would have", "NTA When I got married we wanted shots in different places that meant something to us, we called in advance and had the areas booked and we paid for it. I could not ever imagine bothering people and putting them out by our own lack of planning.", "Wouldn't it have been equally lovely for the newlyweds to not disturb other people on their special day? That would have been super generous on their part.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nIf you were just having one or two drinks, it would not have been a big deal to give them some minutes. But having you guys move your full course meals so they can take pictures is just entitlement.\n\nSame energy as those mums who ask you to allow their child sit at the window seat on the plane coz they want to see the clouds then get upset when you decline", "NTA, they didn't clear it ahead of time with the restaurant and didn't even ask the restaurant,  just some entitled people who thought since they were newlyweds that they should get what they want. I wouldn't feel the least bit guilty for telling them to kick rocks.", "When the hell did day after photo shoots become a thing?\n\n\nNTA", "THANK YOU for bringing some added joy to the world.  Screw douchebags like that.  Why didn't the restaurant kick them out AND comp half your dinner for the offense?!", "As an amateur photographer, who often dies couple shots for fam and friends, I would never ever consider interrupting your dinner. \n\nSecondly  the restaurant manager should had nip this pompous behavior at the beginning. Nta.", "You are NTA, but that couple of photographer happen to be assholes.  The nerve of some people, all three of those assholes.", "You\u2019re less of an asshole than I am. I would of told the bride to wait.  Pay for my meal that she\u2019s ruining if she wanted the booth.  And any further complaints will result in a glass of wine being poured down her dress. \n\nNTa but I am.", "'Hey man, can we buy you both a round of cocktails? We'd love to use your booth for 15 minutes for some photos and the cocktails would be a thank you'\n\n'Sure, go for it'\n\nNTA", "NTA. And a \u201cday after\u201d photo shoot does not compute with me at all. Surely you want photos of real memories at your wedding?!", "NTA. \n\nFirst I've heard of a day after photoshoot. \n\nSure it would've been very kind of you to move for them...BUT considering that they never arranged it with the restaurant, AND didn't want to wait until you were finished eating to take their photos (it's not like they were gonna be late for the ceremony)...entirely their fault. If it was that big of a deal for me, I would've waited until you were finished and had a drink at the bar.", "Heartless? You are paying customers enjoying your food. They are not and they feel entitled to tell you to move? Your food will get cold plus who knows if they will sneeze on it etc. All for pictures no ones really cares about. Nta", "NTA, I can\u2019t imagine how exhausting it must have been to attend their actual wedding", "Hahahahaha nta.. Stuff that. Ur food would be cold and gross.. Or squished into a smaller table.. Someone should have thought ahead n booked or, taken no for an answer.. Tough.", "Day after wedding shoot in full wedding get up, yeah nah.  Tell them to piss off and that they should have booked like you did  Accidentally spill wine etc on her dress if she carries on.", "NTA if they wanted that space they should have booked it. The photographer should never have done this and honestly I'd say something on their social media if they told you who they were. If they were taking photos they could have asked for that booth when you were gone to the waitstaff to use it, and they could have gone somewhere else then come back.", "NTA - when I read the first part I was ready to say you were, because I thought it was going to be a \u2018move your chair for 30sec\u2019 situation, but they are definitely the assholes for just expecting to be accommodated. If they wanted it so badly they should have at least booked the table in advance to do so.", "NTA, IF they was another table IF you hadn't got all the food IF they offered some compensation IF you were just stepping away for 60 seconds maybe then it would have been yes. The entitlement is strong with that one.", "NTA\n\nYour food would have become cold whilst moving everything, and what, are you all going to move back or stay at your new table?\n\nThe couple could have offered to pay for your meal at the very least, but it sounds like they did nothing.\n\nThey could have paid to break the booth for a photoshoot.", "If they needed the table they should have booked the table. \n\nYou were in the middle of eating FFS! The entitlement is off the scale here. Wedding-induced psychosis is a hell of a disease. NTA", "NTA, photographer was the AH, married couple (they are not even bride and groom, they already got married) were the AH's and even the manager was somewhat of an AH. \n\nManager should have kicked them out as soon as they started making a fuss and given you the meal for free because of the shitty experience.\n\nCouple and (very unprofessional) photographer should have reserved the table if they wanted to do a photoshoot at that one specifically. I can't believe they think you should move and let your food go cold whilst they piss about taking photos. GTFO.", "NTA. On top of covering your meal as some as said, they could\u2019ve waited until you were done eating to grab your booth. These people are entitled idiots.", "A day after photo shoot? Sorry but that\u2019s dumb. And they were entitled enough to ask for your table for 15 mins they should\u2019ve at least offered to comp your whole meal. Also. Why didn\u2019t they reserve the table in advance?? They reserved everything else in advance, I\u2019m assuming. \n\nMy husband and I had a micro wedding, and so decided to have a nice lunch with our 10 guests after the ceremony. We knew it\u2019d be a lot of work for the servers so we reserved the table almost two months in advance AND I told them it was for a wedding party. So we got a nice big, private and romantic table! This couple could\u2019ve easily done the same. \n\nNTA OP.", "Would have ignored the request to move as well, I can understand moving if the OP had just arrived, but to move a table's worth of food to a much smaller table ? no chance.\n\nthe newlyweds should have booked the area and paid cash for it\n\nNTA :)", "100% NTA. If this particular booth was so important to them they could have either A. Reserved the booth themselves or B. Waited until OP and her friend were done eating and then had the photos taken. I\u2019m sure they could have spoken to the manager and asked they reserve the booth for them after OP and her friend leave. Then they could have taken other photos around town and go back to the restaurant after. They had no right to throw a fit and cause a scene just because it\u2019s for their wedding photos. And asking the manager to make OP move???? R u kidding me?? As I was reading this I\u2019m thinking I\u2019d just get the manager and have them escorted out or whatever and the groom demands that OP be moved!!!  Ummm. Nope", "NTA. God people are entitled. You're not special because you got married yesterday. Wow.", "NTA. They weren't even offering compensation. You were mid meal. I would have booked that table if it meant that much to me or offered to pay for your meals to move.", "NTA. They could\u2019ve offered money but they didn\u2019t. So they gotta wait like everyone else", "I'm sorry - they just waltzed into a restaurant, on a busy night, to take day after wedding photos without asking permission from the restaurant?! Entitled much. Why would they think that's ok? They're disrupting a functioning restaurant. Many places require you to pay a fee or buy a permit to take wedding photos. They were already lucky enough that the restaurant manager was nice enough to let them be in there in the first place taking photos. NTA", "NTA this is inconsiderate to the servers & bussers and especially to you and your friend, paying customers. Surprised they were allowed to even be in there on a busy night of service; manager should\u2019ve kicked them out when they began to bother you.", "NTA. You don\u2019t lack compassion for telling entitled people to piss off. She\u2019s crying because she can\u2019t get her way.  Calling you heartless is a manipulation tactic. If they wanted to use the restaurant they should have coordinated that with the people who work there. \n\nIf people put half as much time and effort into their marriages as they do the wedding itself, the divorce rate probably wouldn\u2019t be as high as it is.\n\nDon\u2019t give this or them another thought.", "You had hot food and they wanted you to let it get cold and walk away from your food while they were breathing over it or touching it to move it out if the way?  Hello no!!  \nNTA", "NTA they are entitled brats. I get so tired of hearing people use the excuse \"it's our special day\", or \"this is so special\" , if it is so special why didn't you think a head and make  a reservation? Is this where they met? Is this where he proposed? Or is it \"special\" because it's popular? Either way their lack of planning doesn't constitute an emergency on your part.", "NTA.  This is laughable!  Oh, just move for 15 minutes (probably 30) in the middle of your meal?  First, the photog and couple were insufferably self-absorbed.  Second, their request was incredibly absurd.  \n\nThey shouldn't have been allowed to do any photography in the restaurant while it was open (for free, especially).  If it was that important to them, they should've arranged to do it early in the morning, before the restaurant opened.", "What in the narcissism did I just read. They could have quite easily asked the manager if they could simply book that table for ten minutes *after*  you finished and before the next people come, even offering a small fee.\n\nPeople like this piss me off so much because they can't understand how a pragmatic approach to virtually every situation garners the best outcome for everyone. I'm constantly in some kind of battle with people like this at work and I'm close to snapping.", "They might be newlyweds but that doesn't mean their needs are more important than anyone else's. It could have been a special date night for the OP, a romantic anniversary dinner, a proposal, anything, other people have special occasions too.\n\nEven if it wasn't a special occasion they still are under no obligation to move.\n\nThe second I get an entitled person tell me they deserve special treatment for X reason I refuse to give them what they want.", "The rest of her life lol", "Even if I was 15 minutes or so from finishing my meal, I would now take an hour to eat and heavily tip the server. It\u2019s like idiots who honk at you in the parking lot because they think you\u2019re taking too long to leave \u201ctheir spot\u201d.  LULZ, now I\u2019m not going to leave", "Nah, we are all wrong. They will be married 40+years, have 3 kids, teach them to be selfish entitled people, and the cycle continues.
