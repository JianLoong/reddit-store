A story about how they thought their day was so special, they could walk into a restaurant just to inconvenience paying customers to move so they could take photos in a specific booth.  I'm sure everyone they tell that story to will empathize with them as well.", "Those are definitely one of those \u201cwe just got married and everyone should cater to us\u201d couples. Screw em!", "Good god this reeks of main character psychosis \nNTA NTA NTA", "NTA frankly someone should have kicked them out sooner.", "NTA.  It\u2019s pretty bad planning on their part - they easily could have coordinated with the restaurant ahead of time to come in at a less busy time (or even right before they opened).  Or booked the table itself. The manager was correct to not want to disturb patrons in the middle of a meal.", "NTA  They should have reserved this booth months ago.  They were rude for pressuring you.  You are not relatives and friends who owe them some leeway.  You are strangers.  The photog was trying to make a buck, but the woman was being obnoxious.", "NTA\n\nIf you want to have a place to yourself for photos, what you do is book that place.  Not just barge in and ask everyone to leave.", "NTA, if they wanted pictures at that table they should have made arrangements with the restaurant beforehand.", "ROFL!!!  I wouldn't have moved either.  On the other hand, I may have counter-offered that we'd move for, say...twice the cost of our meals.  Call it the cost of entitlement.  But yeah, NTA.", "NTA, you were already eating and it's a bit rude of them to ask you to move for 15 minutes, if you weren't eating then maybe you could have done them the favour but they're assholes for disturbing you", "NTA. What entitled jerks! The world does not revolve around someone just because they're getting married.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, who TF does a DAY AFTER photoshoot?? This couple sounds exhausting.\n\nSecond, you were in the middle of a meal that you actually paid for! I don't care if I was at McDonald's, I'm not walking away from my food for 15 minutes. By the time you got back it would have been cold and nasty. And the couple wasn't even eating!!\n\nSome of this wedding bullshit I read about is completely out of control. Good on the manager for having your back.", "NTA. If it was that important to them they should have made arrangements ahead of time.", "NTA, they can wait or should have called and reserved a section, I'm sure for the right price the restaurant would have agreed.", "If they wanted it that bad they could have waited till you were done or offered to pay or something", "NTA", "NTA- you are paying customers! Those cheap asholes could have reserved that table and paid the restaurant something if it was that important! I can't believe the manager didn't toss them out.", "NTA", "The entitlement surrounding weddings just keeps expanding. Now it\u2019s not enough to bend over backwards for planning and lead up and day of, the entire world is also supposed to revolve around the bride after the wedding. You did nothing wrong, manager was also spot on, the couple is shockingly self absorbed and childish. NTA", "NTA", " NTA but I'd like to know where this restaurant is. I'd really like to go!  :)", "NTA.  Entitled people are entitled to...a lot less than they think.  The restaurant manager should have stepped in a whole lot sooner to protect you.  And they were entitled to \"Please move away, I'm clumsy and a little drunk and I wouldn't want to spill tomato sauce/red wine on your nice clothes\".", "NTA.  The consequences of their failure to plan are their problem, not yours.  \n\nAnd \u201cDay after photo shoot?\u201d  Please, no, this isn\u2019t becoming an actual thing, is it?", "NTA. The idea of leaving hot food to cool off on the table, for strangers to breathe on? Hard pass.", "NTA, and now I\u2019m annoyed that photo shoots the day after a wedding are a thing.", "NTA. That was absolutely ridiculous. And the begging and yelling was just icing on an entitled Bridezilla/groomzilla cake.", "NTA they came into a restaurant where you were already eating and wanted to you to move tables (taking up space of another paying customer) and started yelling to get their own way. They were totallyinappropriate. The solution for them would have been to book the booth themselves and had a meal there.", "NTA their interaction sounded less than promising to me about if you would get your seat back", "NTA\n\nI am shocked that the restaurant manager let it go that far.", "NTA  NTA  NTA.  The restaurant should have kicked them out for a host of reasons.  The photographer should have never even asked you to move.  The couple should have never approached you.  The couple should have made a reservation and paid for the table, and ordered food and taken it in a to-go box, or ended the photoshoot there and had a meal.  \n\nTerrible, self-absorbed, entitled jerks.", "NTA The manager should of kicked them out immediately from the start.", "NTA \u2026..Nope my good would get cold", "NTA. \n\nThe correct thing to do for them would be to say \"Hey, I know this is a major inconvenience but we would love if we could get a couple shots here. We'll gladly pay for your meal if you move?\"", "NTA. Wedding photographer\u2019s perspective: \nIf a specific public space means something to my client, they\u2019re responsible for letting me know ahead of time. I then ask them to contact the establishment so they can set guidelines and suggest slower times. Most places are accommodating if you\u2019re respectful about it. \n\nIn some rare instances where we \u201cpop-in\u201d to a public space on the day-of (situations like being rained out), we still check in with the staff to make sure we won\u2019t be disruptive. Sounds like they didn\u2019t do that \u2014 they just walked in with their privileges. \n\nYou\u2019re paying customers. There were lots of things the B&G/their photographer could have done to not put anyone in this situation and get the photos they wanted. They didn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s not on you to move. And that photographer should have known better.", "Not the ahole!  \nThe newlywed couple was for demanding you move seats.  I mean WOW how entitled.", "NTA.\n\nJesus, the day AFTER their wedding, too--do they just expect that the act of getting married entitles them to everything forever?", "NTA\n\nFood was already on the table. If there was no food at the table yet, then fine, but ONLY until the food shows up.", "\"I'm not ruining your wedding. That was yesterday, and I wasn't even invited. But you are ruining my lunch, which is today, and you're not even invited.\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA. They could have reserved the table if they had planned ahead.", "NTA. If it was so important, they could have probably made a reservation?", "NTA, if they wanted the table, why couldn't they just wait for you to finish your meal?", "NTA - you were more polite than  I would have been.", "NTA\n\nIf the bride and groom wanted their photo shoot in that specific table, they should have reserved it ahead of time and paid the restaurant for the reservation.  \n\nThe fact they interupted your dinner and made a stink about it?  That makes them the AHs here.", "Nta. Let them wait 15 minutes until you are done eating!\n\nBeing engaged does not mean you get to rule the world until you are married. And being a photographer doesn't mean you can control a background. \n\nAnd they were not even eating or spending money there! It is a flicking place of business, not a bridal destination!!", "NTA. Reservations are a thing. They should have made one", "NTA. That was an entitled couple making up bullshit because they think too highly of themselves. You were way too nice. I would have complained to the manager they were interrupting your meal and asked them to be removed.", "NTA. More and more, just tell people they're not the main character in *your* life and just ignore them. They can have whatever temper-tantrum they want and kicked out. The narcissistic \"you have to do this because I want it\" is out of control. Stop coddling these assholes.", "NTA.\n\nI did laugh when the manager turned them down because they weren't paying customers.", "NTA.  And one day after a wedding is just that.  A day.  It's a day like any other. The bride and groom were ridiculous.  If they really wanted pictures there, at that booth, then they should have reserved the table ahead of time.  To ask you to move for 15 minutes while you are in the middle of a meal is absurd.  Good for the restaurant manager for stepping up.  He was exactly right.  Forcing a paying customer to leave mid meal so someone can occupy the space for free is crazy.", "NTA\n\nHm...I'm actually surprised it took that long for the manager to step in. Letting randos harass paying customers is a big no-no, and it's the staff's job to (gently) escort troublemakers away from the dining area. At least that's how we were trained.", "NTA.  Restaurant patrons are generally not free to get up and just move to another table in the restaurant for awhile at a whim and then expect to be able to go back to their own later anyway. The restaurant may have had people that need to sit at those other tables. You can\u2019t effectively take up two tables for the heck of it.  These people were completely out of line for a variety of reasons.", "NTA. If they wanted to do photos there, they should have either made a reservation or gone at a time when they wouldn\u2019t be bothering other customers or staff. People need to remember that their wedding isn\u2019t special or important to anyone who doesn\u2019t know them.", "NTA by far. I wish I could say the bride and groom\u2019s sense of entitlement is astounding, but\u2026they are typical of so many people today.\n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong, OP. And I\u2019m so glad the restaurant manager did the right thing. \n\n(Also: _tears?_ Actual _tears_ because poor little bridey didn\u2019t get a photograph she wanted? Utterly ridiculous.)", "NTA. \n\nIf one booth ruined her wedding, she had a shit wedding. \n\nI went to one of those places in London. They\u2019re expensive and usually require a reservation a few days in advance. They\u2019re super cute locations for photo shoots, but they\u2019re not cheap. I\u2019m shocked the owner let them in to take photos to begin with. It\u2019s in poor taste for them to interrupt paying customers with a reservation. Asking once is fine, but pressing the issue and screaming at a manager is very entitled. I also think it\u2019s shit for them to ask to spend 15 minutes during your meal and not just a quick photo.", "[deleted]", "It really wasn't that big a deal to pick up a plate and move it to another table. But to be belligerent and argue probably meant your food went cold. YTA.", "NTA. They chose to go when the restaurant was busy. That\u2019s on them.", "There is no way they weren\u2019t underfoot in a crowded restaurant.", "Absolutely my first thought.", "NTA. Especially considering that moving to another table with all of your food would have been a hassle.", "Yeah, they could have reserved that table ahead of time.  My mind boggles at the thought of asking strangers in a restaurant to move.", "NTA. Why should your food get ruined for a photo shoot?", "I surprised they allowed three people to just wander around snapping photos. There is no way they weren\u2019t underfoot in a crowded restaurant.", "I don't think the manager did the right thing. The manager should have been watching and intervened and stopped them as soon as they start harassing customers. It shouldn't have taken the groom yelling and calling for the manager for staff to step in and do something.", "NTA. That's a lot of entitlement of the couple to just expect the restaurant & patrons to accommodate them for free.", "This whole wedding industry seems to get more and more out of control.", "The only time I've heard of this happening is if the weather was really crappy the day of or if they wanted to go to a certain place farther away... Getting a photographer two days in a row seems like a lot to me though.", "Does that apply for funeral processions?", "It wasn't even the big day itself, but the day after.", "Oh, I bet they stay married and become the kind of parents that are a teacher's worst nightmare.", "Exactly. I\u2019m sure the restaurant would have been happy to accommodate them if they had called and reserved the use of the table for a fee. Definitely NTA.", "They didn't even offer to help us move the plates. Let alone treat us with something.", "If the other tables were taken and they already had food they didn't want to get cold (which would happen in 15 minutes) how would it have been easy?", "Tbh I was just minding my business with my friend, having our chat and enjoying our full course meal.", "Because they were already eating. Sorry getting married doesn't entitle you to interrupt someone else's dinner that they are paying for. If it meant that much to them they could have reserved the seat for the shoot and paid the restaurant instead of interrupting someone's dinner or they could have talked to the restaurant doubled back after OP left simple. It wasn't even their wedding day it was the day after their wedding.", "You want them to move for 15 minutes after they\u2019ve been served? Should they have to move all their dishes from the meal or leave them there to get cold. How are they TA at all for wanting to eat food that they are paying for? The bride and groom came up in there acting like they owned the place and they weren\u2019t even eating there.", "Serious? Their meals would've been cold after 15 minutes. Bad planning from the couple's  side doesn't mean other people have to cater to them.", "Why couldn't the couple just wait for OP to be done eating then take the pictures when the booth was vacant?  Why force OP to eat cold food they PAID for?  \n\nCome on, now.  Not even the manager was having it.", "Don't be ridiculous, their food was on the table. Reservations exist for a reason ffs.", "It wasn't a plate. It was 2 plates and 2 full platers of food, our wine glasses and our water glasses plus our personal stuff like bags, coats etc. And even if our food went cold (it didn't) how would that be our fault considering it'd go cold because someone interrupted our meal?", "Why should someone\u2019s meal be interrupted because an egotistical couple wants photos? That is an immature response.", "Day after photoshoots are NOT a thing.\n\nIf they want a multi thousand dollar production, then they need to pay for their sets and reserve them ahead of time.", "You should have asked for some payment. \n\nOr asked the manager to add it to their tab", "You are so NTA. If they wanted to take pictures there so badly, they could have made a deal with the manager to pay for a meal and have him call them once you had left since you said no. \n\nThey handled it terribly.", "NTA\n\nI am sure the manager would not want this to become a thing with couples disrupting his paying customers.  You helped him out and you deserved to eat in peace.", "Should have said gotten up and accident spilled your drink on her dress.\n\nApologize and say this wouldn\u2019t have happened if you didn\u2019t ask us to move though", "Maybe if they picked up your check......lollll", "I wouldn\u2019t have moved either, I want to eat my expensive meal while it\u2019s still warm. NTA for ignoring their ridiculous and entitled behavior. I honestly don\u2019t know what was going on in their minds to think they were in the right. I\u2019m glad the restaurant didn\u2019t cater to their demands", "They should have addressed it quickly and ask the couple to leave.", "Yes, then let me cry and call management because we failed to plan.", "Never get between a man and his food", "Couples like this can be so exhausting.. They're still riding that \"It's all about ME\" high.", "Obviously they didn't want to pay. They wanted to inconvenience and disrupt paying customers instead which makes them AH. \n\nProbably influencer AH who think they're entitled to spaces \"because followers\". They could have worked around it and ordered a couple glasses of champagne for the table and for pics but they decided to bug and bring the manager in on it.", "I mean, they wanted to do a photoshoot in a popular restaurant for free, without making a reservation or eating there, and they thought no one, including the manager, would have a problem with that. Talk about entitlement. such assholes.", "Op, leave this one alone. Even that commenter won't do that thing they typed there.\n\nHope you enjoyed your meal?", "I bet if they just called they could have had the whole place for half an hour before they open shop.", " They should have addressed it quickly and ask the couple to leave.", "Probably one of those couples who plaster their lives all over instagram and wanted to look more affluent than they are by photographing in the most recognizable booth of a popular, high end restaurant. Surprised they didn\u2019t ask OP to also leave the food so they could fake like they were eating there.", "Absolutely this, they had **ZERO** business doing this in a place of business without prior arrangement. Those entitled AH's can cry all the way out the door. They were the ones disturbing *everyone* else(who made reservations and were paying guests). If I was the manager, I would have contacted the owner to see if police should be called and asked permission to give them a Lifetime Ban most *especially* the photographer. NTA.", "Yeah there's no way it would have taken just 15mins", "They could have just waited till OP was done eating too and then took pictures like normal functioning adults.", "I bet they DID call and ask what it would cost to have a photoshoot there, decided that they didn't want to spend the money, and thought they could just force the issue if they showed up.", "Restaurants are actually typically pretty busy with prep work half an hour before open.", "Yeah, in the back. In my experience, tables are pre-set the night before in fancy restaurants so people don't have to worry about it during pre-dinner prep. If the shoot was pre-arranged, the manager easily could've accommodated the couple and probably charged them for it.", "But they don't need the dining room while they prep in the kitchen. It would only interfere if the couple wanted an employee to help them for some reason.", "And in my experience, it is not at all unusual for night crew to slag off on post-close duties and leave shit undone for pre-open in the morning. If my manager pre-booked it, we\u2019d make it happen, but it wouldn\u2019t just be nothing.", "If the manager lets the night crew be lazy and leave work for the morning crew, that's a shit manager."]}
