We kindly declined as we were already dinning, having a table full of meals. Plus the restaurant was packed so only a couple of really small tables were empty for us to sit.\n\nThe photographer kept insisting that we should pause for a while and do this favor to the newlyweds. We kept declining.\n\nThen the couple stepped in and both of us started begging us and how special it is that they take pictures there. My friend and I said we understand it might be special but this is a restaurant, they don't own the restaurant and can't just have people move seats just like that.\n\nThe groom ended up yelling and asking for the manager to step in and move us.

Thank you.", "Definitely NTA. How entitled are they! If it meant so much to them they should have worked with the restaurant ahead of time. Manager should have tossed them out way before it go to that point.", "NTA that\u2019s ridiculous!", "NTA. If they wanted that specific booth then they should have made a reservation. I\u2019m really glad the manager didn\u2019t give in to them. Just imagine how the other customers felt about that. They probably should have come before opening or at closing to not bother paying customers.", "NTA", "Nta\u2026and why didn\u2019t the staff intervene sooner. They should have addressed it quickly and ask the couple to leave.", "NTA! But this couple and their photographer most certainly are. Lack of planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on your part. The selfish entitlement of people these days makes me sick!", "NTA.  There's such a thing as renting space, which avoids situations like this.  Anyone who chooses not to do that is taking the chance that they won't be able to do whatever it is they are trying to do (such as a photoshoot in this case).  Besides, who's to say that these people weren't posers trying to generate good will from others so that they wouldn't have to pay for stuff?  I mean, I'm sure that there are real 'Wedding Crashers' out there...", "NTA - they should have called and made a reservation or checked with management first.", "NTA. If they wanted a photo shoot there, then they should have booked the space. Their lack of planning is not your problem.", "NTA It's ridiculous to expect people to pause their meal so you can take pictures.", "NTA. They are seriously entitled. You're a paying customer.", "NTA, would it have been easy to move? Yes. Would it have been nice? Also yes, but you are under no obligation to do so and if they wanted to have a photoshoot there they should have booked.

Them, not you.", "NTA --- If they wanted to have photo's taken they should have booked the restaurant ahead of time.", "NTA.\n\nIf they want photographs there, they could have just reserved a table there. \nYou were eating, and there is no reason why they could disturb your peace and quiet meal like that, especially considering that moving to another table with all of your food would have been a hassle. \n\n\nAnd I think it's incredibly rude not only towards you, but towards the restaurant as well - I can't imagine a bridal party going into a restaurant without eating there, just to take pictures. That's rude and annoying af.", "NTA. I would've let them if the table was mostly clear and it was just a couple snaps, but 15 minutes?? Nah, you and the owner or manger's reasonings were totally justified and they weren't dropping it. They should feel lucky they were being allowed to wander around and take photos leading up to that, with not being actual customers.", "NTA. If they wanted an area be clear of people for a photoshoot, they should have contacted the restaurant to see if they could arrange that for them. Not interrupted a random table mid dining experience.", "Info: where is this magical land where restaurants just allow non-paying \u201ccustomers\u201d conduct a photo shoot in the dining room?", "NTA.

The manager should have called the cops to escort the newlyweds out to the street.", "Nta. If they really wanted the booth they could have paid for your meals.", "NTA they are wildly entitled.  This is grade A horrible behavior on their part.  Asking once is ok, but keeping it up is not.  That\u2019s a big inconvenience to you, and I\u2019m shocked the manager didn\u2019t preemptively kick them out because what they were doing was bizarre.", "This is nuts.\n\nThat photographer risked a permanent photo shoot ban (for everyone) in that restaurant by harassing paying customers.\n\nIf they needed that both so desperately, then they should have contacted the manager and paid any fee they named to keep it open for their ~~contrived~~ *special* moment.\n\nNTA", "NTA holy crap these people have a bad case of wedding brain. Idk what it is that makes people getting married seem to think they\u2019re the main characters of life.

If that spot was so important to them, they should have booked the table for themselves, or offered to pay you for inconveniencing you. Any compassion for these entitled people who think you should eat cold food that you'd already ordered just because they forgot to plan their wedding is misplaced.", "Yeah I would have flagged down my waitress/asked for the manager sooner to get the harassing non-customers to leave you alone. NTA", "NTA", "Why would the restaurant manager let it go that far? Because of the scene the bride and groom created the restaurant should have given you your dinner for free.", "NTA - You were in the middle of a meal and restaurant was packed.  Did they expect you to eat standing up?  Even if there had been empty seats available, it is really rude to ask someone to interrupt their meal, move their plates to another table.  Plus, changing tables without permission of the restaurant staff can upset their seating/reservation system and service -- moving tables might mean moving sections and waitstaff.  That the photographer & couple kept on harassing is ultra rude.", "NTA - how entitled was that? Imagine you had an engagement dinner and had to leave your food to step aside for someone to take photos. You booked that table. They should have booked that table if they wanted it. \nIn addition, what is wrong with the restaurant? If someone did ruin other guests experience to take pictures (which I would not allow in first place as this is disruptive to other guests) I would have thrown them out!", "NTA\n\nif they wanted pics in that booth, they should have called ahead to request it (and pay the restaurant for using that space). 15 minutes is a long time to interrupt someone else\u2019s dining experience. its fine that they asked. but they are AHs for not accepting no, and then yelling and blaming you for ruining this.", "NTA. Many venues would charge to have a photo shoot in their establishment. It\u2019s unreasonable to show up in the middle of a crowded restaurant and ask everyone to accommodate you without any notice.", "NTA. Why should your food get ruined for a photo shoot? They should have offered to pay for your meal if they really wanted the pictures.", "NTA for sure. Day after the wedding photos??? The wedding industry is really going too far. \n\nAs others have said, you were eating and they could have made a reservation", "NTA How entitled they were! Bridezilla and groomzilla were made for each other \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA", "Am I the only one who pictures an unfortunate scene of trying to carefully carry your food to a different table only to have it spill on the bride's dress? \n\nThey were incredibly rude. A professional photographer would know the procedure for photo shoots in private establishments. Asking a seated party to move mid-meal doesn't come across as professional.\n\nIf you had just sat down, menus still in hand, I could see making the request. But once the answer is no, they can wait, sit somewhere else, or leave.\n\nNTA", "NTA - and you absolutely did the right thing standing your ground and not moving. The manager did the right thing also. \n\nif the bride and groom wanted photos in the restaurant that badly they should have made plans to do so. Arranged with management prior to just rocking up and expecting everyone to accommodate them.", "NTA.  Interrupt an expensive meal for *15 minutes*?  Did they offer to buy your meal?  Talk about entitled!!  They should have made a reservation and paid the manager/ restaurant a fee.", "NTA. It was fine for them to ask you once. However when you politely declined, they should've taken that as their cue to either come up with a different plan, or wait until you guys left to get the shot they wanted. 15 minutes is a long time to expect someone to pause their meal.", "NTA. They were trying to get a photoshoot \\*without\\* paying for the location and didn't care who they inconvenienced. You paid for your time, unlike them.", "NTA. No one cares about their wedding but them. Doesn't give them cart blanche to take over a table someone else is sitting at for their precious pictures. What entitled turds.", "NTA. I'm so weary of \"how dare you deny me anything because it's near my (insert special day)!? Your family and friends do special things for you, not the public at large.", "NTA. You need better friends. If you were that heartless the owner would have made you move!", "Definitely NTA.  Their lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on your part.", "NTA. If they don't feel like paying to reserve the location they wanted, they need to accept the possibility that it might be taken by actual paying customers.", "NTA\n\nIf the entitled little bride wanted full use of the space for her photo shoot. She should have rented the space during hours when the restaurant is not open.\n\nBossing strangers around is not likely to get the result you are looking for. If they \u201cneeded\u201d your booth. The appropriate way to handle that would be asking politely AND paying for your check. While you still would have been within your rights to decline. It would have given them a better chance of getting what they want.", "NTA, and even more arrogant that the bride and groom thought they could disrupt a commercial business without payment.  If they wanted to shoot there, it would have been easy enough to call the restaurant and pay to reserve a booth for an hour or so.  Free photos are taken on the street.", "NTA", "NTA they could have paid to reserve that table at a particular time or come back after your meal. Just asking you to move once you had your meal served was incredibly rude & entitled. Them getting angry was ridiculous.", "NTA. They chose to go when the restaurant was busy. That\u2019s on them. They could have asked the restaurant for the opportunity to occupy the booth next, or later that night, or even at a time when the restaurant was not busy.", "NTA \n\nIf they really wanted the table that bad they would have reserved it, how the manager said, they could have paid to take pictures on the restaurant", "NTA they asked, you declined, then they through a hissy fit. Being a bride and groom doesn\u2019t entitle them to the space, in fact I\u2019m surprised the manager didn\u2019t kick them out.", "NTA. If they wanted you to move the least they could have done was offer to pay for your meal in full with tip to the waiter for having to clean extra tables for the inconvenience.", "NTA - who in the hell thinks they have the right to come into a restaurant and ask paying customers to move?!?!  The entitlement.  I give the marriage 5 years, 7 tops.", "NTA they could have asked for your table from the hostess after you were done eating.", "WTF are \"day after the wedding\" photoshoots? FFS this is getting out of control.\n\nNTA", "They could\u2019ve paid someone lol", "Oh how self centered their children will be", "I was thinking that the couple just wanted the people moved out of a background but when OP said the couple wanted them to vacate their table so they could use it, I immediately went to NTA.  That's a lot of entitlement of the couple to just expect the restaurant & patrons to accommodate them for free.  It's a business people, not a charity!", "Exactly the fact they just waltzed in and expected everyone to do what they wanted for a few nice pics.. like wtf", "I was thinking the same thing", "They didn't even offer to help us move the plates at least they wholeheartedly expected us to move tables without any help or any favor in return at least just because it was their wedding shoot.", "I bet they would have to leave, at least some, food on the table ans bride and groom would eat some of it, just to get some cute photo's. So OP would get cold and half eaten food, just so they'll have their perfect pics.\n\nNTA.", "But then they would have to pay for a meal there, rather than using the booth as a photo background for free. They didn\u2019t want a meal, and they didn\u2019t want to pay.", "It probably would have be 30 minutes or longer.  Either way, the expectation was completely out of line.  Their meal would have been ruined."]}
