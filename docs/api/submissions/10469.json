We both keep our own spending accounts and credit cards & any excess is put into a shared savings account. \n\n11ish years ago, I bought a new car that I brought into the relationship, this car was paid off prior to our finances merging and has always been \"my car\".\n\nHe bought a well used (super rusty) truck a few years ago for ~$2k and it had had a lot of problems, this has been \"his truck\".  \n\nWe've always used my car for any distance driving and really for most things outside of towing or when we occasionally are both going somewhere separate at the same time (this is unusual because we both work at home and we spend most of our time together). This arrangement works great imo. \n\nLate last summer my car broke down. It needs a difficult to obtain part and is out of commission until at least this June. We recently had a baby, so I'd been looking at vehicles with a higher safety rating for our (v snowy) area anyways, so I wasn't too heartbroken. \n\nI drive my son to daycare everyday, so i need a vehicle. I ramped up my research and went to 7 dealerships to test drive a bunch of suvs and chose one. It was pricey (nearly 30k) so I brought my husband to drive it and we agreed that it was a good fit. \n\nI told him I could get a loan or we could pay cash, that it was his choice. We paid cash and the car was put under my name. \n\nThat same week, he took his truck in to get breaks done. The mechanic told him the truck was so rusty that it was going to fall off the frame and wasn't worth the price of the breaks.  This is obviously a safety issue for our son so we got rid of the truck. \n\nNow the issue: I told him to get a new car and he won't. Instead we have been a one vehicle family, which has caused problems.  \n\nHe argues with me that the car is not my car,  it's our car.  I told him if he wants this one I can buy another one,  but I want to have my own vehicle where I always have priority when it comes to driving it.  \n\nI know some families only keep one car,  but financially there is no reason for us to do it and its frustrating that when he takes the car, the baby and I are stuck at home (and vice versa). \n\nIt's fine if we share only until June when the car that was mine gets fixed,  but I don't want that to be my car anymore,  I did all the research and work involved in picking and buying the new car. \n\nHe gets irritated when I call it my car or thank him for putting gas in my car,  etc. I think its totally normal for an adult to want their own car and he thinks I'm an AH for refusing to consider it belonging to the family.\n\nWe agreed to ask you. AITA for demanding that I have a vehicle considered mine even though our finances are joint?\n\n\nEDIT to add: we live about 20 min from my family. When he goes out, I'd usually use this time to spend with my family. For now, that's not feasible of he takes the car.", "created_utc": 1676905539, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1178tzt/aita_for_demanding_that_i_have_a_vehicle/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who the car belongs to is not the question - you would like a second car for the family, so focus on that.

What you're saying is completely reasonable and makes sense imo. Having a family car is fine if you have several vehicles. For ex. I have my car, my husband has his car and my old SUV is considered the \"family car\" BUT that's not really feasible when there is only 1 vehicle. Obvi it can work but if you can afford to have 2 vehicles, it's ridiculous not to. Also, it's the WORST to not be able to come and go as you please, especially when you have kids. We had only 1 vehicle when my oldest was a baby and that last a couple of months before I was over it! He needs to get another car.

It just happens. Whether it's work that gets in the way, a sick kid, or whatever, inevitably there will come a situation where you each need to be in different places at the same time and a car is required for both.

Tell him that you're not budging on being a two vehicle household primarily because you two now have a child to support. Ask for his input on how he thinks that would happen.

He main credit card got cancelled, she had to wait until the estate was settled to get rid of the vehicle that was in his name, and banks won't even remove his name from some of the joint accounts they have.
