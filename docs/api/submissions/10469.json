We both keep our own spending accounts and credit cards & any excess is put into a shared savings account. \n\n11ish years ago, I bought a new car that I brought into the relationship, this car was paid off prior to our finances merging and has always been \"my car\".\n\nHe bought a well used (super rusty) truck a few years ago for ~$2k and it had had a lot of problems, this has been \"his truck\".  \n\nWe've always used my car for any distance driving and really for most things outside of towing or when we occasionally are both going somewhere separate at the same time (this is unusual because we both work at home and we spend most of our time together). This arrangement works great imo. \n\nLate last summer my car broke down. It needs a difficult to obtain part and is out of commission until at least this June. We recently had a baby, so I'd been looking at vehicles with a higher safety rating for our (v snowy) area anyways, so I wasn't too heartbroken. \n\nI drive my son to daycare everyday, so i need a vehicle. I ramped up my research and went to 7 dealerships to test drive a bunch of suvs and chose one. It was pricey (nearly 30k) so I brought my husband to drive it and we agreed that it was a good fit. \n\nI told him I could get a loan or we could pay cash, that it was his choice. We paid cash and the car was put under my name. \n\nThat same week, he took his truck in to get breaks done. The mechanic told him the truck was so rusty that it was going to fall off the frame and wasn't worth the price of the breaks.  This is obviously a safety issue for our son so we got rid of the truck. \n\nNow the issue: I told him to get a new car and he won't. Instead we have been a one vehicle family, which has caused problems.  \n\nHe argues with me that the car is not my car,  it's our car.  I told him if he wants this one I can buy another one,  but I want to have my own vehicle where I always have priority when it comes to driving it.  \n\nI know some families only keep one car,  but financially there is no reason for us to do it and its frustrating that when he takes the car, the baby and I are stuck at home (and vice versa). \n\nIt's fine if we share only until June when the car that was mine gets fixed,  but I don't want that to be my car anymore,  I did all the research and work involved in picking and buying the new car. \n\nHe gets irritated when I call it my car or thank him for putting gas in my car,  etc. I think its totally normal for an adult to want their own car and he thinks I'm an AH for refusing to consider it belonging to the family.\n\nWe agreed to ask you. AITA for demanding that I have a vehicle considered mine even though our finances are joint?\n\n\nEDIT to add: we live about 20 min from my family.

Then who ever you take complaints to (I'm British so can't advise there).If you needed a car to get to work you'd have lost your job by now, most people wouldn't be able to afford to buy a new car or have a vehicle off road for months. I'm surprised you let them get away with it. If you need to lie to them say not having a vehicle is jeopardising your job. Put them on blast on social media.\n\nMy 2 cents on the whole situation- put your full effort into getting the loaner car. Then ask your husband to have a conversation about the car situation as a whole. Talk about feeling and try to understand each other. Don't argue and don't react but listen, work toward resolution \n\nThere are a lot of reasons he might not want a second vehicle amd want to use the new car- just spent 30k doesn't want to spend so much money so son, may be waiting for the original car to be fixed and would happily use that, truly doesn't feel that the family require 2 cars so thinks its a wasteful luxury. He paid for half so should be able to use it too, likes the new car, like being seen in the new car, makes him feel good that he can afford it  etc\n\nOnce you know what exactly he has a problem withthen talk it through- you don't feel the old car is suitable to drive in the snow esp with the baby so it's time to get rid of it, you feel too isolated at home without a car so it's important to you to have a second car, it isn't wasteful because it makes you feel safer.\n\nHopefully you can come to a mutual understanding then go through the options 1) one of you uses the loaner car until old car is fixed (maybe trade days) 2) once old car is fixed sell buy something second hand (but then I imagine you'll argue about who is driving it) 3)sell old and buy a new vehicle 3b) could be the same as your new car if he like it so much. 4)you drop him at work and pick him up then you have use of the car during the say. Etc\n\nIf it continues o be n issue go to a couple of sessions of couple therapy to have someone nhelp you through the issue.\n\nI dont think your mind set of car is just mine is helpful. I know you did the leg work and intended it for use mostly by you but you both purchased it and did have some expectation that he would drive it sometimes and your married so its joint anyway. Maybe instead of saying my car you say the blue car (or whatever) or the Honda. I do think he needs to get a second vehicle though. And I dont think its fair that you did all the hard work of research and then don't get to use the car.\n\nIn future, I think it's a good idea to verbalise expectations \"we are replacing my old car so this new one will be for mostly my usage, im going to do the research and find a vehicle that suits my needs do you have anything that you would like me to take into consideration\" \"we are replacing your truck as its mostly for your usage youre doing the research so that the vehicle suits your needs. I would like you to take into consideration the safety rating both for you and especially for the baby\"", "Your dealer can get you a rental paid by Ford\n\nSource: I am a Ford Warranty Administrator.

Everything else is just fluff.", "I told him I could get a loan or we could pay cash, that it was his choice. We paid cash....lots of wes in that sentence for you to consider it your car alone. YTA", "YTA. Put aside the question of the car. In your post you said: \"We recently had a baby\" but \"I drive **my** son to daycare everyday, so i need a vehicle.\".  I would assume it is yours and your husband's son.  I think you and your husband need to have a conversation about structure of the family (rather than just a car): you clearly want to separate your life in part which you share with him and part you do not, while your husband seems to be all in on \"family\" part.", "You are NTA but I honestly think you are making your stand on the wrong issue. Let's be real, the car officially IS a family vehicle that was purchased with joint finances. However, it's still \"your car\" for all intents and purposes. That's just normal husband and wife dynamics. My wife and I co-owned all of our vehicles but we both referred to the one the other drove as \"your\" car. \n\nDon't make the issue about the label of \"my car\" even though you aren't wrong to think of it that way. Make your stand about the need for two vehicles for the family to function. It is entirely fair for you to make that non-negotiable. Bluntly, there are control and independence issues that can be part of you each having your own primary vehicle in addition to convenience.", "[removed]", "If you guys are so financially comfortable, what's stopping you from buying a car with your own personal money, and making sure he's not on the paperwork?", "ESH. Just get a damn second car if you can afford it. The stress you\u2019re adding to both your lives by this back and forth nonsense is not worth it. Even if it\u2019s \u201cnot that serious,\u201d it\u2019s still wasted energy and not worth it.", "I'm conflicted - you got a new car because yours was dying. His was a rust bucket, but he rode it until it died. You agreed on the new car, mainly researched because of your shared child. \n\nSo, shouldn't the use of the shared vehicle be prioritized by who has your child at the time? While in your (OP's) name, if the safety of your child is paramount... Those that have the kids in their possession get the car? And get your other car fixed so you have a back up plan?\n\nThe \"mine/theirs\" mentality should go out the window. Those with the kids get the car. The one without the kids figures something else out. Emergencies happen and no one wants to wait for an Uber/Lyft/whatever to get them to urgent care when there's no need for an ambulance.\n\nGoing with NAH. It's a shared vehicle in finances. Just figure out the parameters. Whoever has your child cannot be vehicle-less. That's not smart or safe.", "NTA for wanting a second car.  Also NTA for wanting to have it be YOUR car.  Just because people are married and share finances doesn't mean they cannot have things that are just theirs.  Of course you should share things that are yours with your spouse as is necessary, but that doesn't change the ownership.  And just a side note - name on a title doesn't always equate to whose it is in a marriage.  This is something that my husband and I argue about a lot.  Of course we have the slightly different situation where things that might be considered mine are ours and the things that are his remain his....but that is a whole 'nother story!", "NTA. You got his agreement on the car since it's a major purchase, but you bought it. It's yours. I'm gonna guess your husband doesn't mean it this way, but insisting on one car when you need two comes across as controlling and as if you shouldn't have autonomy on where and when you drive. So maybe something he should think about.", "NTA.\n\nwe do the same thing & both cars were purchased with joint money. We use MY car for long distances for safety & he uses HIS for work. The only time he uses my car is when he takes our child somewhere for obvious reasons. I mostly use his to go to the dump. But no, it's not unreasonable to want 1 car to be mainly for your use. His refusal to get another vehicle is a safety concern. What if heaven forbid there is an emergency but can't do something about it with one vehicle; or that one vehicle breaks down. And it's not like you ate saying, \"Don't touch it ever\" but it's vital for most families to have 2 cars.", "Right!? These are just odd y t a votes that seem disconnected from reality. While i technically owned as much of my wife's van(s) over the years as she did they were still definitely her vehicles.
