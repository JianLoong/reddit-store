This Sunday I\u2019m picking up my nephew who will be staying with us for 9 days. That trip has been planned for 8 months. This is our only \u201cweekend\u201d off this month and she\u2019s driving 16 hours one way to spend the 2 days with us? I said hell no, my husband is conflicted, she said \u201cyou have to chose\u201d. \n\nFull story; I don\u2019t like my mother in law. When I first met her, it was to go to an important holiday dinner hosted by my husband\u2019s (then boyfriend) extended family. She met us at the hotel and met me before we went, but then took my husband aside and said I needed to change clothes because I looked like a whore. I cried, my husband said we weren\u2019t going anymore and told his mom to leave. We \u201cmade up\u201d later. \n\nAs my husband and I dated I learned more about his relationship with her. They didn\u2019t talk often before me or since. He went to visit her one time alone. \n\nFlash forward and he hasn\u2019t seen her for a while. For whatever reason they never coordinated a time for her to visit or we always had some excuse. Finally she calls my husband and says she\u2019s coming this weekend to visit(it\u2019s Tuesday night). I immediately say no when my husband tells me, I tell him that my nephew will be in on Sunday morning, and she would drive 16 hours one way. \n\nHe hesitates but agrees and tells his mom it can\u2019t be this week, pick another time. His mom guilts him, says there\u2019s always some excuse and that I don\u2019t like her. She says she feels like if she doesn\u2019t come see him right now she may never see him again.\n\nSo he decides to let her come with some conditions of not seeing the house and not seeing me.\n\nI respect his choice but I\u2019m still mad. Because regardless of their relationship and the repair they need, he still let her come out last minute and stay the 2 days before I have company for a week. I\u2019m mad he didn\u2019t see that as impolite and selfish. \n\nWe fought and he said \u201cshe was right, I do have to choose, this sucks.\u201d AITA?", "created_utc": 1689180444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xtw3i/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_mil/", "score": 510, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree with those who ask \"for a 9 yo?\"\n\nOP dislikes MIL for what appear to be good reasons. \n\nIn my opinion:\n\nMIL is a raging A H\n\nOP is over reacting to a reasonable accommodation and has a lot scar tissue.

Also, anyone who is rude and disrespectful to a member of the family (in this case, you) is not welcome to stay as a guest in your home. When they visit your area, they can get a hotel room and whichever members of the family (husband) wish to visit with them can do so out of the home. Your home is a safe space and conflict free zone. \n\nI would discuss with your husband expectations regarding visitors on both sides of the family. You need to agree on what is enough proper notice for both of you and stick to it. Also agree on how many visitors you\u2019re willing to have in a particular time period. \n\nSeems like they both feel it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d for her to visit since your relative is visiting.

How is he a mama's boy?", "It matters because they had planned to spend the weekend together, and they're not going to have another free weekend for a month.", "How did he mot stand up for her when he didn't allow his mother to visit their home because OP told him not to", "It's hard for him because he doesn't have a spine", "I would not be surprised if the MIL ends up at the house because she convinced the son it's the correct thing for them to do.", "That was the compromise reached after MIL said she was coming to visit.", "The mother is the one who gave him the \u201cyou choose\u201d ultimatum, not OP.  So is mother the wrong one?", "I mean, I doubt OPs husband is the one that invited OPs nephew over for the next 9 days.", "I get that part, and I by no means think OPs feelings aren't valid, BUT \n\n1. The nephew was going to be there Sunday so it wasn't like they were going to have the whole weekend anyway\n\n\n2. It sounds like he's trying to repair his relationship with his mother. I'm guessing from personal experience it's because he's tired of resenting her, and while guilting him into it having to be now was a shitty thing to do, I think I understand why he gave in.\n\n\nI know from my own experience with a selfish/toxic parent that sometimes you have to see them face to face to put all your cards on the table if for no other reason than your own peace of mind.  Will she be receptive? Again in my own experience I doubt it, but even just looking them in the eye and getting it off your chest can be enough to start to get past it.", "She will ABSOLUTELY be there, making life terrible for OP, and complaining how they aren't focusing on her after she *drove all this way to see them*.", "If i were OP id be the one in a hotel then, with one room card and hubby can eff off", "Yes, that's what OP is asking for judgement on. OP can forbid her from visiting the house, but in a situation where she will not see MIL and MIL will not be on their property, there isn't really much to be mad about. Her husband is visiting with his mother elsewhere for a couple days before her nephew arrives. That's it.", "If he's working and she cares for the niece - and he's had 8 months!!! To express his displeasure and change plans if he so whished - he is not that affected by the niece s presence", ">why should he put what he wants on hold for what his wife wants for her nephew?\n\nBecause this has been planned for several months. Unless there are extraneous circumstances (MIL is ill, hubby is ill, whatever), mom and hubby can also schedule a time which is more convenient.)", "Maybe OP will come back here and give us an update?", "> She's controlling what her husband wants without any regard for what her husband wants.\n\nThey made plans eight months ago.  Now Mommy's little boy decides to change the plans at the last minute because that's what Mommy wants him to do.  It's very likely that Mommy knew about the plans they made for nephew's visit, and she picked this weekend on purpose just to fuck them over, and he's *still* going to suck up and do whatever Mommy wants.  He's an incredible asshole.", "It is imposing on her plans to spend time with her husband on the only free weekend they have this month. \n\nAnd husband didn't want his mother to come either until she guilted him into it", "OPs MIL is staying in town for 2 days and will not see OP or even be in her house. How exactly is OP affected by her presence any more than hubby is affected by nephew staying in his home?", "OP doesn't want anything to do with MIL. Husband wants to repair a relationship. It's 2 days and doesn't interfere with the nephew's stay. That's it. She doesn't get to dictate. If we asked the husband I'd bet he'd be like...meh, not crazy about having a kid in the house for 9 days, but it's important to my wife. \n\nAnd if they're BOTH SOOOO busy that they haven't had a weekend alone for months, who's gonna be watching the kid and entertaining him for 9 days. \n\nIt doesn't add up.", "Lord I hope so.I don\u2019t trust this MIL, and her husband\u2019s lack of spine is a recipe for disaster.", "What OP is mad about is that her husband didn't prevent MIL from staying elsewhere in her general vicinity. That's not possible for him to do. I agree she isn't an AH for being mad; people can feel anything they want to feel, reasonable or not.", "It's very likely \ud83e\udd23\n\nIf he's that much of an AH I'm sure you're telling OP to leave him, yeah?  \n\nHe didn't change the plans they made 8 months ago. The kid is still coming. \n\nBye.", "OP didn't mention any such plans. The complaint was that this was their only \"weekend\" off and it's still her weekend off to do with as she pleases.", "That's OP take. \n\nAnd if they're so damn busy, who's entertaining this kid for 9 days?", "Only free weekend for BOTH op and husband this month. I already answered", "Fully agree. MIL will not be in OPs space. OP doesn't have to acknowledge MIL. OP can go about their life as normal. Saying the husband can't see his mother is AH behaviour.", "I don't get why you wrote this. OP is mad that the MIL made plans without involving them and the hubby buckled to it. That's a reasonable thing to get mad at. She wasn't trying to prevent the situation, just stated it made her mad.", "He might be working while she took vacation. \n\nOp said both were free and I suppose despite some very whacky labor  laws  in USA they still have the mandatory off days every week.", "Dude. OP and her husband are married. They live together. They have all the time in the world to spend together. She can spare 2 days without having an aneurism. Also just because hubs isn\u2019t openly complaining about nephews stay doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s excited for it. Likely he just understands that she is entitled to spend time with her family, something OP doesn\u2019t seem to grasp herself.", "I wrote it in response to you quoting OP being mad about exactly what I said she was mad about lol", "LOL @ mandatory days off every week.   \n\nSo, she had 9 days of vacation and instead of making sure she got pleasure time with husband, she invites a nephew to ruin any boom boom time?  He gets a weekend and the kid gets 9 days?  Nah.", "You already forget how this exchange has gone down? Why don't you read up?'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: They blocked me. HAHA"]}
