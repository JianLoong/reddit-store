This Sunday I\u2019m picking up my nephew who will be staying with us for 9 days. That trip has been planned for 8 months. This is our only \u201cweekend\u201d off this month and she\u2019s driving 16 hours one way to spend the 2 days with us? I said hell no, my husband is conflicted, she said \u201cyou have to chose\u201d. \n\nFull story; I don\u2019t like my mother in law. When I first met her, it was to go to an important holiday dinner hosted by my husband\u2019s (then boyfriend) extended family. She met us at the hotel and met me before we went, but then took my husband aside and said I needed to change clothes because I looked like a whore. I cried, my husband said we weren\u2019t going anymore and told his mom to leave. We \u201cmade up\u201d later. \n\nAs my husband and I dated I learned more about his relationship with her. They didn\u2019t talk often before me or since. He went to visit her one time alone. \n\nFlash forward and he hasn\u2019t seen her for a while. For whatever reason they never coordinated a time for her to visit or we always had some excuse. Finally she calls my husband and says she\u2019s coming this weekend to visit(it\u2019s Tuesday night). I immediately say no when my husband tells me, I tell him that my nephew will be in on Sunday morning, and she would drive 16 hours one way. \n\nHe hesitates but agrees and tells his mom it can\u2019t be this week, pick another time. His mom guilts him, says there\u2019s always some excuse and that I don\u2019t like her. She says she feels like if she doesn\u2019t come see him right now she may never see him again.\n\nSo he decides to let her come with some conditions of not seeing the house and not seeing me.\n\nI respect his choice but I\u2019m still mad. Because regardless of their relationship and the repair they need, he still let her come out last minute and stay the 2 days before I have company for a week. I\u2019m mad he didn\u2019t see that as impolite and selfish. \n\nWe fought and he said \u201cshe was right, I do have to choose, this sucks.\u201d AITA?", "created_utc": 1689180444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xtw3i/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_mil/", "score": 1097, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree with those who ask \"for a 9 yo?\"\n\nOP dislikes MIL for what appear to be good reasons. \n\nIn my opinion:\n\nMIL is a raging A H\n\nOP is over reacting to a reasonable accommodation and has a lot scar tissue.

Also, anyone who is rude and disrespectful to a member of the family (in this case, you) is not welcome to stay as a guest in your home. When they visit your area, they can get a hotel room and whichever members of the family (husband) wish to visit with them can do so out of the home. Your home is a safe space and conflict free zone. \n\nI would discuss with your husband expectations regarding visitors on both sides of the family. You need to agree on what is enough proper notice for both of you and stick to it. Also agree on how many visitors you\u2019re willing to have in a particular time period. \n\nSeems like they both feel it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d for her to visit since your relative is visiting.

She isn\u2019t affected at all lmao. She doesn\u2019t have to see MIL or have MIL at her house.  If husband is fine with MIL visiting him last minute, why does OP get to decide if he visits with her or not? I\u2019m picking up you\u2019re probably not an adult, but in relationships/marriages it is a huge red flag if your spouse decides who you do and don\u2019t get to see. That is super possessive and controlling.", "I\u2019m confused on what you think is made up? All I stated was what OP said. This is the only weekend this month they have together.", "Or maybe the mom doesn\u2019t schedule last minute? If her son wants to see her so bad, he should have planned something out and invited her. It goes both ways.", "Same. What a bunch of downvoting whiners. The OP is the AH.", "OP never once says that she's upset about him not being there for the weekend. She's mad that he doesn't see it as \"impolite\". You guys are adding motives for OP that were never in the post.", "Dominate his time. Okay. If he wants to see his mom, I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t plan the visit himself. Then maybe it wouldn\u2019t be short notice. She is his wife so they are each other\u2019s family now. They are supposed to want to spend time together. I truly don\u2019t care. I just have experience with a crazy MIL and a husband who doesn\u2019t want to see her any more than I do. It\u2019s just easier to make the wife the bad guy than to take responsibility for never going to see your mom or making an effort on your own."]}
