This Sunday I\u2019m picking up my nephew who will be staying with us for 9 days. That trip has been planned for 8 months. This is our only \u201cweekend\u201d off this month and she\u2019s driving 16 hours one way to spend the 2 days with us? I said hell no, my husband is conflicted, she said \u201cyou have to chose\u201d. \n\nFull story; I don\u2019t like my mother in law. When I first met her, it was to go to an important holiday dinner hosted by my husband\u2019s (then boyfriend) extended family. She met us at the hotel and met me before we went, but then took my husband aside and said I needed to change clothes because I looked like a whore. I cried, my husband said we weren\u2019t going anymore and told his mom to leave. We \u201cmade up\u201d later. \n\nAs my husband and I dated I learned more about his relationship with her. They didn\u2019t talk often before me or since. He went to visit her one time alone. \n\nFlash forward and he hasn\u2019t seen her for a while. For whatever reason they never coordinated a time for her to visit or we always had some excuse. Finally she calls my husband and says she\u2019s coming this weekend to visit(it\u2019s Tuesday night). I immediately say no when my husband tells me, I tell him that my nephew will be in on Sunday morning, and she would drive 16 hours one way. \n\nHe hesitates but agrees and tells his mom it can\u2019t be this week, pick another time. His mom guilts him, says there\u2019s always some excuse and that I don\u2019t like her. She says she feels like if she doesn\u2019t come see him right now she may never see him again.\n\nSo he decides to let her come with some conditions of not seeing the house and not seeing me.\n\nI respect his choice but I\u2019m still mad. Because regardless of their relationship and the repair they need, he still let her come out last minute and stay the 2 days before I have company for a week. I\u2019m mad he didn\u2019t see that as impolite and selfish. \n\nWe fought and he said \u201cshe was right, I do have to choose, this sucks.\u201d AITA?", "created_utc": 1689180444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xtw3i/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_mil/", "score": 210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

MIL is being intrusive and your hubby is probably having a dilemma since he's used to just accepting what his Mom does.", "NTA. \n\nYour husband is the asshole for not giving his mother a firm no. His compromise only makes you look bad and you and him look divided, which is probably what MIL wants.", "NTA. \n\nThe umbilical chord is being starched way too tight.

She's definitely wrong to assume she could visit without checking and wrong to assume that she would stay there. But your husband came up with a solution that means you don't have to see her. They don't talk often and you don't see her often. So is your issue that you just don't like her? That would be fine based on her past behavior. But if that's the real issue can you tell him that?", "Info...Wait, so is she staying at your house or not?", "NTA, her and hubby can stay at a hotel. He does have to choose. And there is only one choice. Give him the marriage counselor or lawyer choice if he needs to see more clearly.", "NTA - She is purposefully creating situations that force you to either roll over or be the bad guy. Her telling you less than a week in advance that she is coming to visit (which would frankly be rude even with more notice) is a perfect example. The conflict didn't start when you said no, the conflict started when she made this completely unreasonable demand. \n\nHer goal is to cause tension in your marriage. Because either you say yes to keep the peace, but feel resentful towards your husband, or you say no and is mad because he feels like he is put in the middle. \n\nSay this to your husband - \n\n\"I am not asking you to choose between me and your mother. I wish you would have considered the situation and recognized on your own that is unreasonable for her to invite herself to our home and expect us to change plans that we may have for the weekend with less than a week's notice.

I feel like you are making me be the bad guy because you are not willing to set reasonable boundaries with your mother.\"", "NTA! Your mil shouldn't be inviting herself to anyone's home, not even her son's. Your husband's first priority is you, his wife. While I get you both don't seem to like one another (I wouldn't deal with someone who called me a whore on the low by pulling my bf to the side either) you still get a say in what will work for your home, end of story. She is being difficult, husband is trying to be a good son, don't put ultimatums on your spouse of you HAVE to choose though either (you so don't have to), husband is being too much of a people pleaser, instead of firmly stating she can come in 2 weeks when it will work for all of you, not just her.

Show up when she's headed back to the airport.", "If the end result was an agreement that she isn\u2019t staying at your house and you don\u2019t have to see her, YTA for telling your husband he can\u2019t see his mother because you have family coming after she leaves.", "As long as she's not in your house, what does it matter?", "NTA- and no he doesn't have to choose.\n\nHe's willing to to let his mom dictate when they see each other.\n\nHe could have arranged a visit to go see his mom if he wanted to.", "If she's not coming to the house and you don't have to see her why do you care if she's coming?

He made an entirely reasonable compromise.", "YTA, Your husband put up some appropriate barriers for you both, you don't have to see her and she's not coming to your house. So I fail to see what the problem is? If it's that you just don't want him to see her at all, that's totally unreasonable.

You do not like you MIL (maybe for a good reason) - fine, she is not giving proper notice - fine. But you do not get to tell your husband not to see his mother because it is inconvenient to you.", "ESH - except your husband. Your MIL sounds difficult and I understand you not wanting to see her. It sounds like your husband also understood that and tried to find a compromise for the upcoming visit. \n\nYou sound like you want your husband to cut off his relationship with his mom, which he doesn\u2019t seem comfortable doing. It sounds like he scaled back on his time with her and that he\u2019s accommodated towards your feeling towards her like a good spouse, but you want more. \n\nI would have your husband set some very clear boundaries in the future about giving notice before a trip, but you should probably work out a setup with him so he can see his mom sometimes if he wants to.", "NTA House guests like her and nephew need to be approved by both sides. People shouldn't invite themselves to stay or visit, but -ask- if it's a good time. The problem isn't the Mil but your husband's abilities to set healthy, respectful boundaries. Encourage him to get therapy as a safe, neutral place to express his feelings and how to advocate for himself in either direction.", "Wait MIL is not to see you or see your house.

Your husband should have absolutely had your back on this one because regardless of whether you like her or not (and it sounds like your dislike for her has been well earned by her shit behavior) no one should just announce that they're coming to visit you on short notice and expect it to be okay. Also, his compromise is clearly scapegoating you and it's really not okay.", "YTA, he was in a tough situation, he found a solution that keeps you out of it unless you want to see her.

At this point it doesn't really matter that your husband came up with a solution (even though I think it's a good one) because he already disrespected you by not asking you and not being on your side. I understand why you would feel how you feel, she insulted you and your husband is still not imposing some boundaries. \nI think you should probably give couples therapy a go to try to understand his side and to find better solutions to communicate to him how he makes you feel with his actions.\nGood luck OP!", "NTA, but tell him SHE told him to choose, not you, and that if he chooses her he still has to live with the consequences of disregarding the wishes of the woman *he actually lives with.* At least if he passes off his mom she's not living in his home. \n\nBTW, she COULD make an effort and try to be more pleasant if she wants your dislike of her to quit interfering in her plans.", "I feel bad for the husband. He's trying to find middle ground to support his wife (MIL doesn't see the house and no contact with OP) and still accommodate MIL (his mother). Clearly a strained relationship everywhere. For all we know, MIL is coming to tell husband she's dying. On the other hand she may just be controlling. \n\nOP has a long standing plan for nephew (apparently 9 yo) to visit for a week. Fine. That takes priority as advanced planning. Some of us are inferring OP is stressed about preparations for the visit that husband was expected to participate in. I agree with those who ask \"for a 9 yo?\"\n\nOP dislikes MIL for what appear to be good reasons. \n\nIn my opinion:\n\nMIL is a raging A H\n\nOP is over reacting to a reasonable accommodation and has a lot scar tissue. That doesn't make her an A H, but is not a good look either. \n\nHusband is stuck between a rock and a hard place. \n\nThis all assumes I am correct that MIL is staying in a hotel and there are scheduled visits of husband to her, and MIL is paying for her own hotel.", "Info: did she stay at your house?", "Oh honey I would choose for him! NTA", "Info:\n\nLet me preface this by saying this is a legitimate question and my final judgement is suspended because I'm a little confused.\n\nIf she's not to see you or the house, then I honestly don't see why it matters.\n\nThis honestly feels like a NAH situation(other than clearly your MIL herself for guilting him) with him wanting to at least try and repair the relationship with his mother unless I'm missing something.", "Agreed. Also, anyone who is rude and disrespectful to a member of the family (in this case, you) is not welcome to stay as a guest in your home. When they visit your area, they can get a hotel room and whichever members of the family (husband) wish to visit with them can do so out of the home. Your home is a safe space and conflict free zone. \n\nI would discuss with your husband expectations regarding visitors on both sides of the family. You need to agree on what is enough proper notice for both of you and stick to it. Also agree on how many visitors you\u2019re willing to have in a particular time period. \n\nSeems like they both feel it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d for her to visit since your relative is visiting. The huge difference is that your relative asked, gave proper notice, and presumably is respectful to your spouse. Very different scenarios here.", "She's not even going to see MIL and MIL is staying at a hotel. How in the world does this affect OP?", "MIL isn't even seeing the house, let alone staying at it.
