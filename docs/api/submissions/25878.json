{"id": 25878, "submission_id": "165nv20", "title": "WIBTA if I implemented the same rules regarding food that my mum enforced upon me when growing up?", "selftext": "My mum (40f) is coming to see me (19f) in two weeks - for the first time since I started university. Just for some context, my family moved abroad a year ago and I haven\u2019t seen any of them since. The distance has given me time to reflect on some of my mother\u2019s strange, obsessive behaviours regarding food, and I\u2019ve since realised that some of her actions were somewhat \u2018abusive\u2019, however I use this term very lightly. \n\nTo outline the situation, we were never allowed to take food from the kitchen without asking. If we were caught doing so, it was called \u2018stealing\u2019 and we would be shouted at and/or sometimes punished. It escalated at some point to locks being placed on the cupboards, a transparent \u2018meat lock\u2019 being placed in the fridge and a camera being installed in the kitchen. She would monitor how many times a day I\u2019d be in the kitchen. If I had been in the too many times she would chastise me, saying that I\u2019m obsessed with food, obsessed with always being in the kitchen and that I have serious \u2018food issues\u2019. During secondary school, I was never sent to school with packed lunch, nor was any money put on my card so that I could buy food. At some point I started to cook the family dinners, and the leftovers would always be allocated to my stepdad, whilst the rest of us would go to school with nothing. We would sometimes get takeaways for dinner, but often times my mum and stepdad got takeaway only for themselves, saying that we weren\u2019t allowed any. \n\nNow, the instance in which I could possibly be the asshole is that i plan to treat my mum as she treated me in regards to food when she visits. I told my boyfriend of my plan to enforce these \u2018rules\u2019, that there will be a curfew for the kitchen, that she is not allowed to take or eat food without permission - and if she does so I will call her a thief. I was also thinking of ordering food for myself and telling her that\u2019s she\u2019s not allowed any. I honestly just want to show her how ridiculous she is about food, but at the same time I just want to be petty because why not. My boyfriend is telling me that I\u2019d be immature for doing this, and that since my relationship with her is already difficult, I\u2019d be better off taking the high road rather than adding fuel to the flames. My dad and sister also agree. Whilst I can\u2019t deny that doing this would be immature, I can\u2019t help but feel that she deserves a taste of her own medicine. \n\nSo WIBTA?\n\nEDIT:\nOkay damn like I didn\u2019t expect this post to actually get much interaction. But I would like to clarify a couple of things: \n\nTo all the people who\u2019ve been calling it abusive, i\u2019m unsure of how to feel about that. Like it did hit me at some point that this wasn\u2019t normal, but it\u2019s not as bad as I was making out. Like I feel like I need to clarify that the situation wasn\u2019t as severe as I made it seem. From around age 16 she was less strict, and the locks on cupboards were removed as well as the fridge safe. As I got more financially independent I was able to by myself food whenever I wanted, even though this annoyed her sometimes. The only time i guess I was \u2018starved\u2019 was at school during lunch. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t call this being starved, I was just somewhat monitored around food.\n\nTo all the people telling me to cut her off, I find it hard to completely resent her because she is my mother, and I recognise that she has done a lot for me. At the same time, that doesn\u2019t excuse her behaviour. I\u2019ve realised that she is a narcissistic parent, so I\u2019m not expecting much/or any accountability from her.", "created_utc": 1693422977, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165nv20/wibta_if_i_implemented_the_same_rules_regarding/", "score": 3305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Personally I wouldn't have herbin my home.", "I just want to say her behavior was totally abusive.

It was horribly abusive.", "NTA\u2026honestly, you are just doing what you were taught.  If mom balks, ask her why?  This is what you taught me is the right way, why should it now be any different?", "NTA - Sorry to tell you this, but you were being abused my your family. They withheld food from you when you were a child. I think it's ok if you want to impose the same rules bc I can understand why you're angry, but I think the better thing to do is to see a therapist and maybe not have them in your life. Everything she/they did was wrong and abusive, I am so sorry!", "NTA, but don't do what you're planning on doing. You say in the comments that you aren't ready to see her but she booked a place ticket anyway - that's your solution right there. Don't let her stay with you.

If she shows up at your door, don't let her in.\n\nBecause how do you know she won't just try to impose her abusive food rules on you on your own home?

Nothing wrong with showing her what she did to you.  Ignore your bf", "Your mother almost certainly knows her behavior was way out of the norm. She either is just fine with it or had little ability (for whatever combination of reasons) to be different than she was.\n\nBut either case, what do you possibly have to gain from this asshole behavior except some fleeting pleasure from dishing it back to her? The only result would be a worse relationship with more bad feeling (and now you're not just the innocent victim).\n\nChoosing to be petty and immature is pretty much core YWBTA. Your bf seems to have expressed everything very well - listen to him and your family.", "I say this lightly but YWBTA.  BF is right and it would definitely be childish to go along this route.  That said, there is still some catharsis to be gained here.  A simple and powerful message you send as an adult.  Something along the lines of \"Mother, you and I are both grown women now.  The time has come for you to acknowledge you and your husband's abuse of my sister and myself during our childhood.  I have attempted to mend this bridge many times before, yet you have made clear you intention to not budge and admit your mistakes.  Until you are willing admit and atone, you and your husband are not welcome in my home or in my life. \"", "Often on AITA I see people describe an AH and then describe their retaliation and I think \"I don't know that being a bigger AH\" is the way to solve most problems...\n\nBut I absolutely support this plan and I think it's not being a bigger AH at all--it's holding up a mirror. NTA. Frankly, I'm surprised your dad and sister don't agree. I mean, have her views on this changed any? It she have some moment of enlightenment after you left and said \"my views on food are kind of nuts! I should stop this\"? Because it doesn't sound like she did. In which case, you're simply upholding her own rules. What? Won't she be flattered to see how well you learned those lessons she instilled? Won't she applaud how closely your adhering to what she's taught you? No? They don't think so. Well, I am with you, OP, go ahead and let's all find out!\n\n(Please update us if you go through with it)", "You would move firmly into ESH territory.

Any single thing you have listed here would cross the line to abuse; all of them together are just horrible.\n\nDon't enact this plan. Tell your mother that now that you have had time to see what life is like away from them, and how other families interact with food, your eyes have been opened. That you can see how horribly abusive she was, and how you are going to ensure that you never pass that abuse on. Give her an opportunity to make it right, if you want, but don't just cycle it back to her.", "YWBTA. Her behaviour in the past seems to indicate some deep-seated issues around food specifically or maybe a paranoia generally. And yes, abuse.

Why not show her a healthy example of healthy attitudes and healthy respect towards others who are not \"stealing\".", "ESH \n\nBut her behavior is in the past. \n\nPut it this way, if you call her lightly abusive, and then you are lightly abusive back, well you still are being abusive.  \n\nDoing something shitty because it was done to you in the past doesn't make it less shitty.  \n\nDo you WANT your mother there?  Because it sounds like you just want to antagonize her.  At which point I don't even understand the point of you having her visit you.", "So...you feel she treated you abusively, and you want to respond by being abusive back? Really?

You're just as bad as her and she was definitely an AH in my eyes. Do you think she was an AH? If you do, you already know the answer to your question. Your mum was horrid to you in regards to food as a kid. I get that. But it's up to you to break that cycle. Personally, I'd call her out on it and leave it at that (if you haven't already).

Then it went crazy. Sending you to school without food , putting a camera in the kitchen, ordering take out but not for you, that is way OTT.\n\nJust a few questions. Did you have financial difficulties growing up and every bit of food was precious?

NTA", "Why are you letting her visit at all?", "First, your mom was abusive and  Neglectful- You were sent to school with no food and no way to buy food. Do not have her in your house.

Let us know how it went", "NTA\n\nYou would not be an asshole. \n\nHowever, this won\u2019t solve anything. I get it - my mom was pretty bad too. \n\nWhile this kind of petty revenge can feel really satisfactory - will it solve anything? Will it accomplish anything for you beyond the satisfaction of petty revenge?\n\nI tend to think longer term. In your situation, I\u2019d be considering what I want and plan to have in the future regarding a relationship with mom. Will doing this make anything easier for you? Or will it make the relationship even more strained and difficult?\n\nYou grew up with a mom who ignored your needs, and didn\u2019t respect you at all. \n\nBut now you have some control over the relationship as well, and you can demand respect. Your petty revenge won\u2019t help you be respected - it will make your mom view your as even less worthy of respect than she already thinks. \n\nWhat might be a healthier alternative for during your mom\u2019s visit - set and enforce healthy boundaries. Talk to your bf in advance about what you will and won\u2019t tolerate so that he\u2019s prepared to help enforce and support you. \n\nFor example - your mom is going to make nasty comments based on the food you have at home. You know she is going to be selfish and demanding. You can prepare statements for what you might say to her common comments. \n\n\u201cMom, this is my home. You haven\u2019t paid for this food, and I won\u2019t tolerate you commenting on what we have. If you don\u2019t like what\u2019s here you can go out and buy yourself other things to eat.\u201d \u201cNo, you will not get to have the leftovers all to yourself. We will be sharing the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.\u201d \u201cMom, it\u2019s rude to order yourself takeout without seeing if bf or I would have liked to order. You can go eat it outside of our flat.\u201d \u201cMom, if you make another comment based around my body and eating habits you will be leaving.\u201d \n\nDecide on what boundaries you want to have, and how you will respond when she breaks them. And she will break them. You know she will. \n\nThe way I did it for myself was that I didn\u2019t do anything like making a list (that I told her about). I knew if I came in with a list of grievances that she would just play victim and wouldn\u2019t listen to a damn word I said. My mom\u2019s controlling behaviours tended to have her making threats to get what she wants (Ive been disowned 2-3 times). Her intent was for me to apologize for things I didn\u2019t do to gain back her attention or something. I opted for the route of calling her bluff. Each time she\u2019s disowned me or given me the silent treatment I\u2026.Run with it. I\u2019ve never initiated contact because I refuse to give her that power. She hasn\u2019t tried disowning me in a decade although recently she has tried the silent treatment again. For my mom, I also decided to reduce her delusions of control by using a \u201cgrey rock\u201d method (I did not know this term until recently). Basically - I\u2019ve always kept her on an information diet. If it isn\u2019t something I feel she needs to know, she doesn\u2019t. Pretty much everything she knows about my life is stuff that is public knowledge - I do not confide in her about anything. This limits her chances to try and control me. It also pisses her off, but I don\u2019t budge at all. I also live almost 2000km away which makes it a lot easier. \n\nThat was what works best for me and my mom\u2019s main issues. I am happiest with a VERY low contact relationship.\n\nYou need to decide what will work best for you. \n\nYour idea for petty revenge is just petty revenge.

Parents or herself? Maybe they were saving?  I'd say it's fucked up to do what she's considering if her parents are paying for her to go there.. did she get a scholarship? Academic or sports- would be proof she got enough nutrition to outperform other people... yes, even the mind needs nutrients and food to function correctly.. so many unanswered questions.\n\nRegardless of all that, I don't think it will be as satisfying as she thinks. Maybe for the moment. But it won't last..", "I mean, my mom got reported to CPS for forgetting to put lunch money on my account too many times in high school. \n\nStraight up, unrepentantly, and intentionally not feeding your child? WTF?!", "Abuse, neglect, child endangerment.... Need confronting, not petty revenge.", "Umm. Are you being serious? \n\nOP doesn't need to share SFA about her weight, body type, exercise levels or really ANYTHING like that to justify that her mother was abusive. \n\nSending a child to school without food is abusive. Denying a child food when having your own meal in front of them is abusive. Locking food away is abusive. \n\nMy guess was that her mother is somehow subsidizing her university, which is the only reason OP is entertaining her as a guest. \n\nBut also, what she hasn't told us doesn't mean you or I should be making any assumptions at all. \n\nBottom line, her mother was abusive in restricting and denying her child FOOD. \n\nThere's no nuances to it. It's a fact.", "Exactly. I'm always of the opinion if someone treated you sp badly and it hurts enough that it makes you depressed, just get a little revenge by being a little petty. Afterwards you feel better and have something to laugh about. It helps your heart.\n\nI did that with my exhusband and inlaws. I wouldn't have survived otherwise. I know people who got completely mute for a while from being treated this way. I got my mini revenges, would tell my mother about my pettiness and we had a big laugh which healed my heart and gave me strength to go on for a little longer.", "sometimes gratification isnt the best way to happiness.", "Ah. If she bought a plane ticket without being invited, instead of playing stupid food games just don't let her in and even better, leave town that weekend.Let her fly out for nothing. I get that you're mad, she sounds superrrr abusive, but I think you are going to be the most upset if she stays with you. You should not raise your own blood pressure like that. Just block her number, she's awful", "Yeah I don\u2019t understand how this was overlooked by her teachers?? Like wtf aren\u2019t they mandatory reporters", "Using the word \"stealing\" from their own kitchen...it just give me chills.  My 2 years old sometimes arrives in the living room with a banana and makes me so proud he already take it when he wants it. Food is for everybody that is hungry.", "Or she apologizes, admits it was wrong, and then tries to move on.\n\nThat doesn't always feel any better.  For someone who hurt you over and over for as long as they had the power to do so to easily admit it was cruel and wrong as soon as they can no longer control you or force you to submit to their demands?\n\nYou're left knowing they will repeat the abuse if they ever have a position of power over you again, but everyone else will see the apology and wonder why you can't let it go.", "The vindication is in how big of a hypocrite the mother shows herself to be.", "Please do this", "You don\u2019t need a solution here. OP is an adult. You can\u2019t go back and fix the abusive mother and at this point in her life OP\u2019s mom isn\u2019t going to admit any wrong doing.", "Yeah 19 is too young for this payback, wait till the mother is elderly and infirm... then do it", "OT, but why do foster parents become foster parents if they hate kids??  Serious question. I don\u2019t really understand \u201cfostering\u201d children. My understanding is that it\u2019s entirely voluntary, and done because they have the means to do so, a love of children, and want to help.", "Yeah, I had to scroll back up to \"I use the term 'abusive' very lightly\" and go \"uh, you...you shouldn't, you should be using it very seriously\"", "Yeah you would think, and maybe for some people that would be enough. But usually it\u2019s only vindicating if she admits to being a hypocrite. If she denies it and gets angry, it only feels even more unjust. Like being gaslit as a child when your mom accuses you of something, and refuses to believe you even though you know you\u2019re right. The fact that you\u2019re right and they\u2019re wrong isn\u2019t enough; they have to believe it too", "I think being petty is what op needs. It\u2019s not about a resolution. I had an instance like this with my dad once. I didn\u2019t need the resolution. I needed the big fight. Me and my dad are on pretty good terms now. If that fight hadn\u2019t happened. We probably would\u2019ve never actually had such a good relationship. OP might personally need to have the same house rules as mom for mom\u2019s visit and tell mom, \u201cI adopted the same kitchen rules you had in the house mom. I like them. Makes my food last longer. Thank you for instilling that in me\u201d", "Power, control, the desire to be the \"big strong\" entity towering over a smaller person. Those kinds of people love to punish, take out their anger and cause hurt. They choose kids probably because they're the most vulnerable, and easy to manipulate into staying quiet. It's fucking heartbreaking.", "Op has to do it purely because it will be fun, not because it will accomplish any single thing. If this were me, I\u2019d aim to piss mom off and then go NC.", "You are lucky. Our home has 2 Gods. Odin is very fat, about 18#. Thor is older and has shrank from his former 18#, to 12#. But he is our sniffer and eater. His favorite bagels is everything bagels. He simply will not let cheddar sour cream ruffles be eaten alone. He only eats oatmeal the way I make mine. Not anyone else\u2019s. He sees hubby as an easy mark, and starts by putting his paw up to the plate, pulls it down for a better look, then goes in for the pounce. And you may wonder what Odin does during these direct assaults on my husband\u2019s dinner? Absolutely nothing. He does not deal with affairs of people food. Thor believes he is a K9, so his brother|father just beats him up as if he were. The cats are obviously in charge in our house.\n\n\n\nNo OP. You are NTA for wanting wanting to give your mom a taste of her own treatment. But leave it as a well thought out therapy session you didn\u2019t have to pay for. I watched my own 81 year old mother have to dance around her mother coming into our home and emotionally abuse her and return it trickled down to us. My own grandmother would come to our him in paradise to vacation and treat us horribly all the while taking our cousins all over the world. Never asked if we wanted to travel, but we wrote them letters our whole life\u2019s. Telling them our dreams. We were military so dad had west coast duty stations after the war. Do you know the one thing my mother still to this day has never done? Say a mean thing about her mother. But she always made sure we knew, that she would have protected us from her mother if she had been able. Be the bigger person. But don\u2019t let her carry on the abuse.she will be your guest. It would not be a terrible idea to write a pleasant little note for the guest room. Telling the occupants of sone house rules. The very first one could be: the kitchen is the heart of our home. And as such shall remain open at all times. And stock the house with delicious healthy food. Get some fancy seltzers or soda. Maybe some fruit juice blends. Have some fun turning her rules on their ear. \n\nBe better. But don\u2019t take no shit!", "I mean, her family are warning her but perhaps it's not to rock the boat? Not a lot of info on family dynamics, there could be enabling involved", "I miss my cat, she was r/purrrfect", "She still did it though. Got me fucked up. Step dad can\u2019t just come into a family and start making all the demands and choices. If my kids had a stepdad (they have their actual dad), I\u2019d be damned if I let him make all the decisions about MY kids. He can kick rocks if he suggests I do t give my kids lunch for school or at least money for lunch."]}
