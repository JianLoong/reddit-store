Just for some context, my family moved abroad a year ago and I haven\u2019t seen any of them since. The distance has given me time to reflect on some of my mother\u2019s strange, obsessive behaviours regarding food, and I\u2019ve since realised that some of her actions were somewhat \u2018abusive\u2019, however I use this term very lightly. \n\nTo outline the situation, we were never allowed to take food from the kitchen without asking. If we were caught doing so, it was called \u2018stealing\u2019 and we would be shouted at and/or sometimes punished. It escalated at some point to locks being placed on the cupboards, a transparent \u2018meat lock\u2019 being placed in the fridge and a camera being installed in the kitchen. She would monitor how many times a day I\u2019d be in the kitchen. If I had been in the too many times she would chastise me, saying that I\u2019m obsessed with food, obsessed with always being in the kitchen and that I have serious \u2018food issues\u2019. During secondary school, I was never sent to school with packed lunch, nor was any money put on my card so that I could buy food. At some point I started to cook the family dinners, and the leftovers would always be allocated to my stepdad, whilst the rest of us would go to school with nothing. We would sometimes get takeaways for dinner, but often times my mum and stepdad got takeaway only for themselves, saying that we weren\u2019t allowed any. \n\nNow, the instance in which I could possibly be the asshole is that i plan to treat my mum as she treated me in regards to food when she visits. I told my boyfriend of my plan to enforce these \u2018rules\u2019, that there will be a curfew for the kitchen, that she is not allowed to take or eat food without permission - and if she does so I will call her a thief. I was also thinking of ordering food for myself and telling her that\u2019s she\u2019s not allowed any. I honestly just want to show her how ridiculous she is about food, but at the same time I just want to be petty because why not. My boyfriend is telling me that I\u2019d be immature for doing this, and that since my relationship with her is already difficult, I\u2019d be better off taking the high road rather than adding fuel to the flames. My dad and sister also agree. Whilst I can\u2019t deny that doing this would be immature, I can\u2019t help but feel that she deserves a taste of her own medicine. \n\nSo WIBTA?", "created_utc": 1693422977, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165nv20/wibta_if_i_implemented_the_same_rules_regarding/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing good will come out of this, it will only deepen the rift.  \n\nAnd btw, it wasnt abuse-ish, it was abuse. She let you starve. a wonder you havent developed an eating-disorder. I would rather at some point call her out for being an abusive parent. Also, consider therapy - when she did stuff like that, i wonder what else she might have done which has left scars? \nYour mother was (and is?) abusive.

Your mom abused you. This is abuse. Neglect. Deprivation of basic needs and resources. Your mom straight up, hard core abused you. \n\nAnd I\u2019m so sorry. You deserve better.

It won\u2019t accomplish anything for you and it will probably end up in an explosion and further (verbal/emotional) abuse towards you. \n\nIf your mom saw you as a commodity or a belonging when you were young, she still sees you that way. She is not going to be capable of \u201cgetting the lesson\u201d you want to show her. I have a feeling doing this will only make YOU feel worse and have little to no impact on her. \n\nBut listen, also, you don\u2019t have to put her up if you don\u2019t want to. Talk to your partner and devise a plan for removing her early if you need it. This is your first time seeing/spending a lot of time with her since you\u2019ve come to the realization that she is actually your abuser.

If you have this much built-up resentment against your mother (and justifiably, it sounds like), be an adult, call her or write to her to tell her why you're upset, and postpone her visit. I'm sure a lot of people will applaud the instinct to \"be petty because why not\" - well, because most of the time being petty absolutely sucks, and isn't an effective way to resolve interpersonal issues.", "Your mother was not \"ridiculous\" she was, and probably still is, an abusive psychopath.   Personally I wouldn't have herbin my home.", "I just want to say her behavior was totally abusive. I just read a book about that family in southern California that had like ten or twelve kids and sometimes kept them in cages. They were very like this around food. It was horribly abusive.", "NTA\u2026honestly, you are just doing what you were taught.  If mom balks, ask her why?  This is what you taught me is the right way, why should it now be any different?", "NTA - Sorry to tell you this, but you were being abused my your family. They withheld food from you when you were a child. I think it's ok if you want to impose the same rules bc I can understand why you're angry, but I think the better thing to do is to see a therapist and maybe not have them in your life. Everything she/they did was wrong and abusive, I am so sorry!", "NTA, but don't do what you're planning on doing. You say in the comments that you aren't ready to see her but she booked a place ticket anyway - that's your solution right there. Don't let her stay with you. Inform her ahead of time she won't be staying with you - you can even say it's because you don't want her bringing in her food rules to your home - and stick with it. If she shows up at your door, don't let her in.\n\nBecause how do you know she won't just try to impose her abusive food rules on you on your own home? You aren't going to get one up on her in this - she has a lifetime of experience being the abusive A H here, whereas this will be your first foray into that territory.", "NTA.  Nothing wrong with showing her what she did to you.  Ignore your bf", "Your mother almost certainly knows her behavior was way out of the norm. She either is just fine with it or had little ability (for whatever combination of reasons) to be different than she was.\n\nBut either case, what do you possibly have to gain from this asshole behavior except some fleeting pleasure from dishing it back to her? The only result would be a worse relationship with more bad feeling (and now you're not just the innocent victim).\n\nChoosing to be petty and immature is pretty much core YWBTA. Your bf seems to have expressed everything very well - listen to him and your family.", "I say this lightly but YWBTA.  BF is right and it would definitely be childish to go along this route.  That said, there is still some catharsis to be gained here.  A simple and powerful message you send as an adult.  Something along the lines of \"Mother, you and I are both grown women now.  The time has come for you to acknowledge you and your husband's abuse of my sister and myself during our childhood.  I have attempted to mend this bridge many times before, yet you have made clear you intention to not budge and admit your mistakes.  Until you are willing admit and atone, you and your husband are not welcome in my home or in my life. \"", "Often on AITA I see people describe an AH and then describe their retaliation and I think \"I don't know that being a bigger AH\" is the way to solve most problems...\n\nBut I absolutely support this plan and I think it's not being a bigger AH at all--it's holding up a mirror. NTA. Frankly, I'm surprised your dad and sister don't agree. I mean, have her views on this changed any? It she have some moment of enlightenment after you left and said \"my views on food are kind of nuts! I should stop this\"? Because it doesn't sound like she did. In which case, you're simply upholding her own rules. What? Won't she be flattered to see how well you learned those lessons she instilled? Won't she applaud how closely your adhering to what she's taught you? No? They don't think so. Well, I am with you, OP, go ahead and let's all find out!\n\n(Please update us if you go through with it)", "You would move firmly into ESH territory. But forget that - if you are using the term \"abuse\" lightly, you need to give it the weight it deserves. Your mother was absolutely abusive as you were growing up. Any single thing you have listed here would cross the line to abuse; all of them together are just horrible.\n\nDon't enact this plan. Tell your mother that now that you have had time to see what life is like away from them, and how other families interact with food, your eyes have been opened. That you can see how horribly abusive she was, and how you are going to ensure that you never pass that abuse on. Give her an opportunity to make it right, if you want, but don't just cycle it back to her.", "YWBTA. Her behaviour in the past seems to indicate some deep-seated issues around food specifically or maybe a paranoia generally. And yes, abuse. For you to behave in the same way that upset you so much (and rightly so) would be almost showing her that this was correct and that's the way the normal world operates. Why not show her a healthy example of healthy attitudes and healthy respect towards others who are not \"stealing\".", "ESH \n\nBut her behavior is in the past. \n\nPut it this way, if you call her lightly abusive, and then you are lightly abusive back, well you still are being abusive.  \n\nDoing something shitty because it was done to you in the past doesn't make it less shitty.  \n\nDo you WANT your mother there?  Because it sounds like you just want to antagonize her.  At which point I don't even understand the point of you having her visit you.", "So...you feel she treated you abusively, and you want to respond by being abusive back? Really? Will that make you feel better, or would you be better served telling directly the things you've written here? That her behavior was abusive (not lightly abusive, plain Ole abusive) and you still hold negative feelings about how she treated you.\n\nSoft YTA", "NTA for thinking it. But remember, if you do it. You're just as bad as her and she was definitely an AH in my eyes. Do you think she was an AH? If you do, you already know the answer to your question. Your mum was horrid to you in regards to food as a kid. I get that. But it's up to you to break that cycle. Personally, I'd call her out on it and leave it at that (if you haven't already).
