My daughter got pregnant at 14, and it was very shocking news, but we found out very early on, and she got to abort it. A few months later and she got pregnant again and I couldn't handle the situation very well at the time but having my sister (her aunt) talk to her about what she was planning to do, she decided to keep the baby which I'll admit I wasn't very happy to hear and I told her she'll have to be responsible about the consequences.\n\nOf course as a mother I couldn't have her work and distract her self from school, I didn't want her to miss on her childhood so I had to work evening-night shifts to care for my granddaughter while Lia was in school. \n\nI realized that Lia has been taking advantage of my situation and making me cancel plans so I can babysit for her. I overheard her making plans for Valentine's 2 weeks ahead on the phone with someone saying, \"My mom will do it she has no life anyways,\" and laughing afterward. Being a single mom and having to work multiple jobs was hard enough but since she gave birth to her daughter, I haven't gone out to any party, I've canceled many weekend gatherings so that my daughter can be able to hangout with her friends and if I did go, I'd always have my granddaughter with me and for her to laugh about my situation like that angered me. \n\nThat same day, I was asked by a guy I've been seeing to accompany him on Valentine's, and I was hesitant, but I didn't want to miss the chance. He's a really nice guy, I haven't been on a date for almost 6 years, and it wouldn't hurt to give my daughter a taste of motherhood when she least expected. \n\nI told my daughter that I got asked out for Valentine's and she was happy at first but then asked if I was going to take her daughter with me and I said obviously not and she'll have to cancel plans for a day. I didn't expect her reaction to be so extreme she cried, screamed, and told me I was being selfish and that I was letting her miss on her date just because I thought a guy was interested in me. \n\nThe argument didn't end very well, I stood my ground and went to that date, and she had to cancel plans, but she's still really mad about it and has been ignoring me. I love my daughter, and I wouldn't want her to miss anything, but I wanted her to learn a lesson and be responsible. My sister agrees with me but my friend told me i should have done it on a normal day not on Valentine's.

Being a live in babysitter? You will only harm her and the child, she will never learn responsability.\n\nThat last fact can be attested by the fact that she got pregnant twice in months while being 14.

She can't constantly push her responsibilities on her, there is a price when you have children.

It seems she's taken you for granted in a big way and you're going to have to put up boundaries that stop enabling it, as much as you don't want to, for your granddaughter's sake. She needs to take on the responsibility of parenting before her daughter is old enough to realize she doesn't want to take care of her.", "NTA.

All her friends are watching how easy it is to have a baby and still do anything they want. They might make that choice now. Every high school has one kid that has a baby. And every one of their friends sees everything they go through! I remember this girl Monica how she couldn't go to any of the school dances. She couldn't go to a football game on the weekend. She had to go straight home after school and couldn't stop and get a soda and hang out with us. Because she had a baby and she had to mother that baby. WE ALL saw what would happen if we got pregnant and not one of us did! I mean they're not your responsibility, but you're not doing them any favors!\n\nFurthermore I love that you went on a date and it's high time you get a social life! The way we teach our kids to be adults is by letting them experience consequences and taking on responsibility. Let her! \n\nYou keep going the way you are and she's going to have another one because why not? It's super easy to have a baby when you don't do any work.", "NTA.  Stop enabling your daughter's bad behavior. Is she finishing high school this year?  Tell her going forward you will only watch her child when she is working and studying.  It's time for her to grow up.  Also, where is the baby's father and other grandparents in this picture?\n\nAlthough late to ask, when she got pregnant the first time, did you not follow-up with a conversation about contraceptives?  If you haven't done so, it's time to make sure she is on birth control and using condoms to avoid having a second child anytime soon.  Good luck!", "I see stories with multi-generation teen parents who still support 'abstinence only' sex-ed and it just baffles me. How many generations of teen parents do you need before you admit that it just doesn't work, and you need to make sure your kid is fully informed.", "I had my daughter at 19, I was married, and I expected a baby, so that's a different scenario.", "That's all well and good that she's a great student, but sounds like she's a terrible mother. So are you going to become mommy for a few years while she's living it up in college?", "Did you have conversations with her about safe sex? About consent and body autonomy? About birth control?\n\nDo you know who her friends are? In fact, do you know who got her pregnant? Do you at least know it wasn\u2019t some adult creep?\n\nDid you monitor her social media usage and make sure she wasn\u2019t getting groomed?\n\nDid you make sure she knew she could always come to you if she needed help or advice, even if she had done something you might not approve of?\n\nWhat measures did you take after the abortion? Did you talk to her about it? Get her into counseling? Put her on birth control? \n\nI know teenagers make dumb mistakes, but a 14 yo is still a child. It\u2019s deeply concerning that she got pregnant twice, and that 3 years later she still doesn\u2019t seem to have taken any responsibility for her choice to be a parent.", "She was fourteen. Nothing about this is simple, its tragic.", "Daughter's free time needs to be spent learning how to BE A MOTHER! She gave up her right to free time and typical teen activities when she became pregnant the 2nd time.", "Did you talk to her about birth control or take her to get it after the first abortion?", "And how much is the responsible student thing going to last once she\u2019s in college, especially if she\u2019s clearly not really matured since getting pregnant at 14? \n\nLoads of uni kids were I\u2019m from completely bomb their first semester or even year at Uni because they get carried away with the sudden freedom and lack of structure Uni has compared to high school (and I absolutely included myself in this demographic too). \n\nCollege party scenes are notorious after all. And if she\u2019s still not on BC, she\u2019ll probably wind up pregnant again.", "Of course she doesn't cancel plans to take care of her own child because her mommy does it for her. Her mom can't study & take her tests for her though. That's why mom needs to tell daughter to take care of her own child!", "I had a pregnancy scare at 13-14 (I wasn\u2019t even sexually active at the time, I was just an idiot teenager and thought I was the next Virgin Mary or something), and while my dad was super supportive and understanding (he bought me the pregnancy test to humour me even though he explained there\u2019s no way I could possibly be pregnant if I wasn\u2019t sexually active, etc.), he still had me sit down and watch a few episodes about teen mums and whatnot. \n\nI absolutely agree that OP should\u2019ve done a better job hammering home about the risks involved with unprotected sex and being a teen mum, but also with having sex that young (the risk of predators, being groomed, or ending up in abusive relationships).", "well her mom is a 36 y/o GrdM", "There's a good chance it was also a teen. Don't know for you but knew many 14-15 year old that were sexually active when I was a teen myself.", "[removed]", "I asked her about her partner, why didn't they use some form of bc and that a child at her age was a huge responsibility which I don't think she was able to handle and we agreed abortion was the best choice. I admit I didn't handle the second pregnancy very well as I found out a week after my grandfather (who i was very close to) passed away when I was still mourning and my sister (who's a half sister so not related to him) handled the situation mostly.", "OP reminds me of my mother. Ridiculous curfew and no bc. Sex-ed, my ass! Constant calls on the cell phone. She raised my niece. She was pregnant 2 days after my mother died. I was raising Hell because I knew the bf was gonna baby-trap her. Sex-ed and bc were \"inappropriate\", for good girls.\n\nI seriously taught my child everything she needed to know. Took her to the GYN at 15. BC. She was just contemplating having sex. Cool! Condoms? Spermicide? Baby, I will hook you up! \n\nShe's 38 and child-free.", "Info: Was she in therapy or getting any other kind of help after her abortion? Who keeps getting your child pregnant and why do they still have access to her?", "You have completely failed your child several times, OP.  You took a 14 year old's word that she wouldn't get pregnant again like a fool and now you're letting her gallavant around while you raise her child.  Lordt have mercy.  YTA.", "That's what I mean. I was talking about the grandma", "So many strong and tenuous assumptions to support the narrative you've constructed. How about we Occam's razor this thing and just assume that 14 year-olds make poor choices.", "Curious where you're from that two minors having sex would be rape. Like who raped who at that point?", "You're just making baseless smears. If she chose to keep the kid, that's on her and that choice has consequences. That's not remotely comparable to being anti-choice/pro-forced birth and you know it. Bad faith BS doesn't contribute to a meaningful dialogue.", "Mine too.", "I think they were comparing abortion to contraceptives. Which, based on my early pregnancy experience, even being 6 weeks pregnant can be harder on your body than contraceptives; that plus an abortion? Probably much easier physically to regularly use contraption.", "Would you say that to an 11 year old who got pregnant?? Jesus. \"Becoming a mum\" doesn't automatically give you the life experience and knowledge of an adult. Yes it probably changes you as a person but it isn't a fucking cheat code to being an grown up. \n\nYeah, this girl is 17, she should be more considerate, but also she's still a youth and her mum decided to make a petty point instead of fucking talking to her daughter.", "The father should be prosecuted for statutory rape. It's disgusting that so many people let males get away with this shit. I hope he's at least paying child support.", "In the UK this is certainly the prosecuting guidance.  If its 2 teenagers, close in age and no aggravating circumstances then the case is dropped.\n\nAssuming the police are even interested to begin with, which considering they're given similar guidance will generally be a nope.", "A child is a child and not a consequence. \n\nThe forced birth comment is about the language they use \u201cshe had sex and needs to face the consequences\u201d in order to justify denying abortions. The language everyone is using against this kid is similar.", "Idk the streets were dangerous and I just hated waking up feeling like shit all the time. I didn\u2019t want to depend on substances to exist anymore. I had to quit else I would definitely be dead in a ditch somewhere or in prison. I was in a program for boys with behavioral and addiction issues for a while, court ordered. \n\nI agree that women and girls need agency over their bodies and need birth control options and the ability and knowledge to use them.\n\nWhat I object to is this entire comment section vilifying a 14 year old and gleefully talking about what trash she is for getting pregnant. I guarantee all the people talking shit did stupid stuff at that age. People act like she\u2019s a monstrous piece of shit and I don\u2019t like it.", "A child is not a punishment.  There has to be a balance. The \u201cconsequences\u201d of treating a teen mom like their child is an eternal life lesson that never ends is post partum depression, decreased education for the mother, and poor outcomes for the family as a whole.", "Seems like birth control wasn't on anybody's list of decisions", "17 is old enough to miss a valentines day as the only consequence of making a stupid mistake and then disrespecting the mother that is taking care of your responsibilities.", "Thank you. It\u2019s truly fucking horrible, the whole thing makes me sick - that poor little girl. My heart breaks for her, she didn\u2019t have a brain anywhere close to developed enough to understand the choices in from if her.", "The only consequence? Really?", "Apparently OP DID have the conversation about safe sex and birth control with her which is a big point, but thinking about it, I used to climb out my window and sit on the 2nd story windowsill at that age. You don't have full risk assessment until at least your early 20s. \n\nYes she chose this, more willingly than we first thought, but it's still not right to treat her like she's an adult who chose this", "Yes, agreed. She made a choice, but there limits to what choices a 14 yo is capable of making."]}
