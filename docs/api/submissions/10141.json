My daughter got pregnant at 14, and it was very shocking news, but we found out very early on, and she got to abort it. A few months later and she got pregnant again and I couldn't handle the situation very well at the time but having my sister (her aunt) talk to her about what she was planning to do, she decided to keep the baby which I'll admit I wasn't very happy to hear and I told her she'll have to be responsible about the consequences.\n\nOf course as a mother I couldn't have her work and distract her self from school, I didn't want her to miss on her childhood so I had to work evening-night shifts to care for my granddaughter while Lia was in school. \n\nI realized that Lia has been taking advantage of my situation and making me cancel plans so I can babysit for her. I overheard her making plans for Valentine's 2 weeks ahead on the phone with someone saying, \"My mom will do it she has no life anyways,\" and laughing afterward. Being a single mom and having to work multiple jobs was hard enough but since she gave birth to her daughter, I haven't gone out to any party, I've canceled many weekend gatherings so that my daughter can be able to hangout with her friends and if I did go, I'd always have my granddaughter with me and for her to laugh about my situation like that angered me. \n\nThat same day, I was asked by a guy I've been seeing to accompany him on Valentine's, and I was hesitant, but I didn't want to miss the chance. He's a really nice guy, I haven't been on a date for almost 6 years, and it wouldn't hurt to give my daughter a taste of motherhood when she least expected. \n\nI told my daughter that I got asked out for Valentine's and she was happy at first but then asked if I was going to take her daughter with me and I said obviously not and she'll have to cancel plans for a day. I didn't expect her reaction to be so extreme she cried, screamed, and told me I was being selfish and that I was letting her miss on her date just because I thought a guy was interested in me. \n\nThe argument didn't end very well, I stood my ground and went to that date, and she had to cancel plans, but she's still really mad about it and has been ignoring me. I love my daughter, and I wouldn't want her to miss anything, but I wanted her to learn a lesson and be responsible. My sister agrees with me but my friend told me i should have done it on a normal day not on Valentine's.

Being a live in babysitter? You will only harm her and the child, she will never learn responsability.\n\nThat last fact can be attested by the fact that she got pregnant twice in months while being 14.

She can't constantly push her responsibilities on her, there is a price when you have children.

It seems she's taken you for granted in a big way and you're going to have to put up boundaries that stop enabling it, as much as you don't want to, for your granddaughter's sake. She needs to take on the responsibility of parenting before her daughter is old enough to realize she doesn't want to take care of her.", "NTA.

I\u2019ll make an edit so it\u2019s clearer.", ">The person getting the daughter pregnant is equally responsible and should be sued for child support if he  is an adult, or pending if he is a teen.\n\nIf he's an adult impregnating a 14-year-old, there should be more than just child support pursued.", "Parents can tell their kids they can get another abortion or give up the child for adoption or move out and take care of their own shit. OP didn't have to raise the baby.", "I just\u2026your 14yo child just had an abortion and you DON\u2019T have her movements under supervision 100% of the time? That child would be going to a babysitter\u2019s house before and after school until I picked her up. There would be 0 minutes of the day that she wasn\u2019t under the supervision of a trustworthy adult. I just can\u2019t imagine being like \u201cwell, I assume she learned her lesson so nothing needs to change\u201d.", "She still could have gotten pregnant. Have you spent any time at a middle or high school? Of a church? They have sex in the bathrooms, closets, at the park after school, etc\u2026", "The daughter doesn\u2019t necessarily need to raise the baby. If it were my daughter I would just adopt the baby. A teen isn\u2019t ready for babies.", "It seems like OP was also a teen mom and really highlights how we're all failing here", "Exactly. I don't have a problem with her watching the baby during school hours, but that child needs to remember she's a mother now. I have a friend who's daughter had a baby at 16. She watched the baby while her daughter was in school, she was already watching her older son's kids while him and his wife were at work. But she was to come home right after school and be mom. She told them she would watch the baby the night of homecoming and prom but other than that, if they asked and she said no, just remember no is a complete sentence.", "Probably.", "Continuing a pregnancy and giving birth is *much* rougher on the body than any number of early abortions.  Of course BC would be better.", "Abortion is much safer than pregnancy", "The abortion pill taken early enough isn\u2019t rough on your body. Pregnancy is rough on your body.", "My niece had an IUD when she was in high school. No worrying about taking a pill every day. I think she still has one now.", "I see thank you for clarifying.", "Not planning on being sexually active?! What the FUCK? She got pregnant at FOURTEEN & months later got pregnant AGAIN ? Do you still believe she's not going to be sexually active & not get pregnant again before she can, or will, care for the kid she has now?!\n\nedit to remove judgement cuz this is soo screwed up! OP, you've ruined any kind of childfree life for yourself for at least another 18 years. Step back! Let her take responsibility for her kid & stop letting her make you the mama of her kid", "the daughter *chose* to keep the baby, and is now essentially guilting her mother into raising the baby. \n\ni don\u2019t entirely disagree with you, but actions have consequences. she chose to abort the first time, then got pregnant months later and wanted to keep it. welcome to the real world, kid. i\u2019m all for as an adult doing everything possible to help, but from the post it sounds a lot like mom put her entire life on hold to work to support her daughter and grandchild, and watch the grandkid when she wasn\u2019t working. while the daughter is either at school or our having fun with friends or boyfriends.", "And she needs to do like every other mom does, take your kid with you. And then have a rare time out when you pay for a sitter if you can afford it. This girl gets to go to school, no job, and gets to hang out childless with her friends all the time. That is no consequences", "Thank you for making me aware it was confusing. I didn\u2019t realize until you mentioned it that it could be misinterpreted.", "I mean, you cannot force a teenager to take a pill every day, you cannot force an IUD or implant, and you can\u2019t force an abortion or even adoption. These are all legally up to the daughter to decide.", "And you know this girl is going to expect to go off to college and leave the kid with grandma because she's never had to actually be the parent before", "I mean, if I had a kid who got pregnant twice I\u2019d be giving the pill Nurse Ratchet style and checking under her tongue before she could leave the dinner table.\n\nI\u2019m kidding, mostly. But while a parent can\u2019t hold a kid down and force an IUD into them, they definitely have the right to exert a lot more control over their kids than this woman did. When the situation absolutely calls for it, of course.", "I don't know if that's true if she's under the age of consent", "It can be very strongly suggested, and if the child is not cognitively able to make good decisions for their own health the parent is allowed to override their decisions. There is a test for cognitive competence in minors to decide whether they understand the gravity of their situation. Clearly Lia would still fail this test at 17."]}
