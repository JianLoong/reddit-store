My daughter got pregnant at 14, and it was very shocking news, but we found out very early on, and she got to abort it. A few months later and she got pregnant again and I couldn't handle the situation very well at the time but having my sister (her aunt) talk to her about what she was planning to do, she decided to keep the baby which I'll admit I wasn't very happy to hear and I told her she'll have to be responsible about the consequences.\n\nOf course as a mother I couldn't have her work and distract her self from school, I didn't want her to miss on her childhood so I had to work evening-night shifts to care for my granddaughter while Lia was in school. \n\nI realized that Lia has been taking advantage of my situation and making me cancel plans so I can babysit for her. I overheard her making plans for Valentine's 2 weeks ahead on the phone with someone saying, \"My mom will do it she has no life anyways,\" and laughing afterward. Being a single mom and having to work multiple jobs was hard enough but since she gave birth to her daughter, I haven't gone out to any party, I've canceled many weekend gatherings so that my daughter can be able to hangout with her friends and if I did go, I'd always have my granddaughter with me and for her to laugh about my situation like that angered me. \n\nThat same day, I was asked by a guy I've been seeing to accompany him on Valentine's, and I was hesitant, but I didn't want to miss the chance. He's a really nice guy, I haven't been on a date for almost 6 years, and it wouldn't hurt to give my daughter a taste of motherhood when she least expected. \n\nI told my daughter that I got asked out for Valentine's and she was happy at first but then asked if I was going to take her daughter with me and I said obviously not and she'll have to cancel plans for a day. I didn't expect her reaction to be so extreme she cried, screamed, and told me I was being selfish and that I was letting her miss on her date just because I thought a guy was interested in me. \n\nThe argument didn't end very well, I stood my ground and went to that date, and she had to cancel plans, but she's still really mad about it and has been ignoring me. I love my daughter, and I wouldn't want her to miss anything, but I wanted her to learn a lesson and be responsible. My sister agrees with me but my friend told me i should have done it on a normal day not on Valentine's.

You shouldn't give up all your social life so that she doesn't have to give up anything. Covering for her finantially so she doesn't have to work and can build a good life for ? Amazing parenting. Being a live in babysitter? You will only harm her and the child, she will never learn responsability.\n\nThat last fact can be attested by the fact that she got pregnant twice in months while being 14.

Make sure she understands this.\n\nTelling her that you'll care for her child so that she can keep attending school is one thing.

She can't constantly push her responsibilities on her, there is a price when you have children. You need to sit her down and explain to her that she isn't always going to get her way and that you do have your own life. Your granddaughter is her responsibility not yours. School is one thing, she can miss out occasionally on dates, especially since she thinks she has no responsibility and that you will just take over. That needs to change.", "NTA.

I don't know what your situation was like, but either to show her that you did it without support or that the support you received was different and you still made it out. It seems she's taken you for granted in a big way and you're going to have to put up boundaries that stop enabling it, as much as you don't want to, for your granddaughter's sake. She needs to take on the responsibility of parenting before her daughter is old enough to realize she doesn't want to take care of her.", "NTA.
