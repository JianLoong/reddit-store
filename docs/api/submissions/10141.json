My daughter got pregnant at 14, and it was very shocking news, but we found out very early on, and she got to abort it. A few months later and she got pregnant again and I couldn't handle the situation very well at the time but having my sister (her aunt) talk to her about what she was planning to do, she decided to keep the baby which I'll admit I wasn't very happy to hear and I told her she'll have to be responsible about the consequences.\n\nOf course as a mother I couldn't have her work and distract her self from school, I didn't want her to miss on her childhood so I had to work evening-night shifts to care for my granddaughter while Lia was in school. \n\nI realized that Lia has been taking advantage of my situation and making me cancel plans so I can babysit for her. I overheard her making plans for Valentine's 2 weeks ahead on the phone with someone saying, \"My mom will do it she has no life anyways,\" and laughing afterward. Being a single mom and having to work multiple jobs was hard enough but since she gave birth to her daughter, I haven't gone out to any party, I've canceled many weekend gatherings so that my daughter can be able to hangout with her friends and if I did go, I'd always have my granddaughter with me and for her to laugh about my situation like that angered me. \n\nThat same day, I was asked by a guy I've been seeing to accompany him on Valentine's, and I was hesitant, but I didn't want to miss the chance. He's a really nice guy, I haven't been on a date for almost 6 years, and it wouldn't hurt to give my daughter a taste of motherhood when she least expected. \n\nI told my daughter that I got asked out for Valentine's and she was happy at first but then asked if I was going to take her daughter with me and I said obviously not and she'll have to cancel plans for a day. I didn't expect her reaction to be so extreme she cried, screamed, and told me I was being selfish and that I was letting her miss on her date just because I thought a guy was interested in me. \n\nThe argument didn't end very well, I stood my ground and went to that date, and she had to cancel plans, but she's still really mad about it and has been ignoring me. I love my daughter, and I wouldn't want her to miss anything, but I wanted her to learn a lesson and be responsible. My sister agrees with me but my friend told me i should have done it on a normal day not on Valentine's.

You shouldn't give up all your social life so that she doesn't have to give up anything. Covering for her finantially so she doesn't have to work and can build a good life for ? Amazing parenting. Being a live in babysitter? You will only harm her and the child, she will never learn responsability.\n\nThat last fact can be attested by the fact that she got pregnant twice in months while being 14.

Make sure she understands this.\n\nTelling her that you'll care for her child so that she can keep attending school is one thing.

She can't constantly push her responsibilities on her, there is a price when you have children. You need to sit her down and explain to her that she isn't always going to get her way and that you do have your own life. Your granddaughter is her responsibility not yours. School is one thing, she can miss out occasionally on dates, especially since she thinks she has no responsibility and that you will just take over. That needs to change.", "NTA.

I don't know what your situation was like, but either to show her that you did it without support or that the support you received was different and you still made it out. It seems she's taken you for granted in a big way and you're going to have to put up boundaries that stop enabling it, as much as you don't want to, for your granddaughter's sake. She needs to take on the responsibility of parenting before her daughter is old enough to realize she doesn't want to take care of her.", "NTA.

There would be consequences for her choices. Kudos to you for making sacrifices so she can further her education, but that doesn't mean she gets to go off to parties  and expect you to actually raise her child. I think you and your daughter need to sit down again and have a long talk about expectations going forward meaning you will do what you can so she can focus on school but NOT so she can go off and party.

It is one thing to help your daughter care for her kid, and another to give up your live for it. It was her decision, and she can at least spend the weekends with the kid.

You are doing great at ensuring she continues her education. However, allowing every social opportunity to occur for her while ignoring your own self care is crazy. She is still maturing and a child too, but don't kid glove her because of this. OP it may be time to speak with someone you trust with experience in teenagers with babies. People throw out therapy, but that is up to you. It could be just as simple as contacting a group that specializes in teenage mothers to find that guidance. Bless you for what you are doing, because in our house she would only be going to structured activities through school events or community, not 'dates' that resulted in not one but two pregnancies. I understand we cannot sit over our kids every minute, and that these situations happen, but she cannot have full freedom. Her choices have resulted in not being a teen with no responsibilities. If she wants that level of freedom there are still options available like open adoption.", "NTA. You are being taken advantage of and your daughter has no respect for you.

I can't believe that after all you have done, she could say that.  But she is 17 years old.

You get to tell her that she needs to stay home more. You don't have to force her to never go out, but at the same time it's long overdue for her to make sacrifices.", "NTA - But she is clearly taking advantage of you.

Daycare, housing, etc.    Don't let her take any more advantage of you - only babysit/grandma time on your terms.", "NTA. Your daughter is selfish. The child is not your responsibility for a second so the fact that you stepped up is super awesome. The fact of the matter is you're making it too easy for her though. The child is hers.

Youre daughter is not mature enough to be a mum, im sorry. Auntie better step up.", "NTA. What is she going to do when she starts college, ffs?", "NTA! \nYour daughter hasn\u2019t learned about consequence. Pregnant once, abort, then pregnant again.

I\u2019m not saying she can\u2019t enjoy friends, school or events, but her responsibility is now yours. You\u2019ve allowed it. I get it. You don\u2019t want her to miss anything.
