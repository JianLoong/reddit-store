Does he think that the world will pay to accommodate her? He need's to grow up it's his responsibility not his baby sisters or her partner, definitely not the ah", "NTA - she's 8! She doesn't want to be at a bloody wedding reception anyway! Your brother should handle his own child's well being and not try to shoehorn her into a situation that isn't suited to her. Have the party you want to.", "NTA. It's unreasonable to think that there won't be music at a wedding reception.\n\nDoes she not already have noise cancelling headphones? My nephew is autistic and noises can trigger him, so he's had them since he was 2 years old", "NTA I'm autistic, at 8 I was also prone to meltdowns. I wasn't diagnosed yet so no one knew why I acted that way, so my parents just dealt with it. \n\nYour brother knows. He can find alternatives. If his daughter hates loud noises, why don't they already own noise canceling headphones?", "NTA. I'm *all for* inclusion for people who are neurodivergent, but the solution was either earplugs or noise canceling headphones. He did not want to do that, and that's on him. Asking someone to change their entire wedding party for one person is excessive. It sounds to me that he can't get a sitter because she gets overstimulated easily and probably is concerned about how she is treated when he's not there, or can't afford a professional. Or maybe he just wanted her to experience what a wedding is like. Both are great excuses, honestly, but he needs to accommodate for her comfort levels. Not you.", "NTA. Totally fair to make *reasonable* accommodations but this isn\u2019t reasonable.", "NTA - eliminating music is a huge ask of someone! I understand he wants his daughter included, but he doesn\u2019t seem to understand your wedding isn\u2019t about his daughter.", "NTA - It's your wedding, those aren't reasonable accommodations", "NTA, and I say this as someone on the spectrum myself. Noise cancelling headphones are not that expensive and are more effective than you'd think. Honestly, I think that getting a pair for her would be a worthwhile investment, but that's entirely up to her and her parents.\n\nI'm usually firmly on the side of accommodation, but dictating what, if any, music you get to play *at your wedding* is going too far. The harsh truth is, reality isn't always going to perfectly accommodate people with disabilities, and Hailey's parents need to realize that and work with her to develop coping strategies for less-than-ideal situations.", "As someone who is also autistic and doesn't tolerate loud noises very well, NTA. \n\nI would've brought ear plugs. Then again, I'm an adult. Your brother is being an AH to both you and his daughter.", "NTA. You have every right to play music at your reception. What they're asking is unreasonable.", "NTA \n\nThe accommodations that your brother suggested/ asked for are unreasonable.\n\nSince Hailey's parents are aware that she is sensitive to noise, it is reasonable (not to mention responsible) for them to already have noise canceling headphones for their daughter.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any easy way out of this.  I\u2019m sure someone will call me ableist, but I don\u2019t think you should have to fundamentally change what you want for your once in a lifetime event.", "Bruh, NTA - that\u2019s a lot of nerve to ask someone to change one of the most important days in their lives just to accommodate a child. She can be apart of the wedding party but the reception is a whole other story.", "NTA - no music at a wedding reception is a super unreasonable request. \n\nSomebody who can't tolerate loud noises is going to miss out on things in life.

Your wedding. Special event. Do what you want. The brother should be supportive of your wedding and making it all about you, not himself or his daughter. \n\nHe either accommodates for the wedding music by getting plugs or headphones or he doesn\u2019t come, his choice. \n\nIt\u2019s not a proper wedding without music.

I\u2019m 1,000% in support of reasonable accommodation for disabled and neurodivergent people, it\u2019s the right thing to do and it makes the world a better place. This specific request is not reasonable. It\u2019s a wedding reception, music is expected and customary. And frankly, *not* having music would make the experience unpleasant for most of your guests! Hailey\u2019s parents will have to come up with a solution that doesn\u2019t cause more problems than it solves. Earplugs, noise-cancelling headphones, or perhaps they need to consider a babysitter, though I imagine that may be difficult for obvious reasons. I feel for them, but their daughter is simply not going to be able to be accommodated in every situation, even when people are generally inclined to help when possible, but it\u2019s not always possible. They need to have backup plans.", "You are not making anyone's life more difficult. NTA. This is out of line.", "Nope Hailey needs to not be a part of the reception if it is going to cause her distress\u2026", "NTA. So you aren't allowed to have the wedding reception you want and are paying for because of one child. If attending will disrupt Hailey's routine than she shouldn't come. It's a wedding reception. Kids don't want to be at boring adult party anyway. Both his kids can attend the wedding, but not the reception if your brother wants to be fair and make it feel like Hailey isn't the only one not attending. Her is novel idea why doesn't your brother just attend the ceremony, but not the reception because as a parent he knows it would be disruptive for his child. Instead he thinks you are supposed to alter your wedding reception in a signficant way by not having music just so his daughter can attend. Your wedding shouldn't be about his daughter's routine.  I get so frustrated by wedding guest who act like not attending is not an option. It's a better option than expecting someone to completely alter a significant part of their wedding reception just to accomdate then when they aren't even the ones getting married.", "NTA, she's eight..she won't care about skipping your wedding and your brother is hella entitled.", "NTA it your wedding day and music at reception is kind of a  big thing your brother is responsible for his child if she need noise cancelling headphones he's to pay for them.

If you know it's load you brind their table/gaming device withe headphones.  He is not doing his daughter any favors, because the world will not stop for her. \n\nYou ANTA your brother needs to help his daughter find ways to live and how to deal with uncomfortable situations. So she can grow to have a full life.", "Two words: Fuck Keith.", "NTA. When you have a sensitive child, especially a neurodivergent child, you get used to managing situations to meet the child's needs. Your brother and his partner will need to manage the situation for their child, most likely with a babysitter on standby, but possibly with an action plan for one parent to leave early with Hailey. He cannot expect you to have a wedding without music, but you could try to make a concession to allow Hailey to participate. You could agree to play soft music at the start of the reception and maybe even through dinner, so Hailey will be able to stick around for photos and food, and then save the party music for dancing after people have eaten. I remember our good friends had babysitting lined up for the 5-year-old flower girl during the reception, so they could have fun at the party.", "NTA. \n\nYour wedding day is for you and your partner, not anyone else. Also, they\u2019re voluntary and not mandatory, as cruel as it sounds. If your brother wants her to be a part, she can stay in another room and he can stream it to her with a set of headphones on. That way, she\u2019s there but it\u2019s not interrupting the ceremony/reception.", "NTA\n\nI understand dad is looking out for his child, but his requests are a bit much. You simply can't have a wedding reception without music. More than likely, with all the people there, i could see that alone being too much for this girl. \n\nI think that he doesn't already have noise canceling headphones for her, knowing sound is such a trigger, he should have something to help her deal with that. Because as child as this is: the world cannot and will not be quiet to accommodate anyone. Giving her tools now to handle it would be better for her mental health. It sounds like this is something that he knows she needs and might have even tried to use it as a way to guilt someone else into paying for them. \n\nThat being said, i think to keep the peace, insist on the noise canceling headphones. You can get them if you want (it is close enough to Christmas that might be the perfect excuse anyway). I'm not sure if it's too late to maybe just make it a kid free wedding? Then no one's kids are there and the point is moot. It might also cause more drama. \n\nObviously the situation isn't ideal. Dad can help her prepare though too, helping reduce possible over stimulation in the days leading up to help give her more time. As long as she has the headphones and a quiet place she can go to (say an empty hall) it might make it manageable, as well as providing her a comfort object or something. She can be there and partake as much as she wants, but then go into a corner with a tablet or something if it makes her happy.", "NTA. This is going to ruin the wedding day. this is one of the most importamt days of your life. Hailey won\u2019t even remember it. And she also won\u2019t even enjoy or want to be there. Hailey should get a babysitter. have a family photo with Hailey included at a quite dinner where everyone\u2019s dressed up.", "NTA and this is 9ne of the reasons I hate \"autism parents\". \n\nI am autistic and it is no one's job but mine to make sure I am comfortable in a crowded setting like a wedding.\n\nEdited for spelling", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No or very quiet music at a reception sounds awkward asf. She\u2019s 8, she can easily stay at home with a babysitter or one parent.", "NTA. you can't have a party without music, it's impossible. It's one thing to do your best to accommodate a beloved niece with a difficult condition, but you can't ruin your own weeding. Some people in the spectrum can't be around too many people and/or new people. You sweet niece fortunately doesn't seem to be bothered by that. But if she or someone else was, would anyone think that to accommodate that person you should limit the wedding to five guests the person knows? No one would think that's reasonable. I really feel sorry for her and I get their parents trying to give her the most \"normal\" life they can, but she's in the spectrum, there will always be things that won't be appropriate for her, no matter what, and they need to start accepting that.

Frankly, just the crowd noise may be enough to overwhelm her. She needs to wear headphones. And you don\u2019t need to buy them as they should have them anyway. They should also have a plan to take her outside or out in the hallway to give her a break. You can help there by letting them know of a sensory-safe space where she can take a break. Ask them what sensory input helps her (most autistic folks have something.) Supply this in some way in that sensory space. \n\nThere is a chance here that Hailey doesn\u2019t even care about being included. It does not seem like an event she is likely to enjoy. Keith and his wife should talk with Hailey and ask her, but there is no way you can ask that without coming off as the bad guy.", "Tell your brother to get a babysitter or don't come.\n\n\nThat your wedding isn't about him or his daughter and he isn't entitled to ask for such an outrageous thing and get mad when he hears a no.\n\n\nNTA\n\nDONT FEEL GUILTY, HE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT HIS DAUGHTERS DISABILITIES MEAN SOMETIMES SHE HAS TO SIT OUT OF THINGS AND IF HE DOESNT WANT TO COME BECAUSE OF THIS, THAN ITS HIS LOSS.", "NTA. I\u2019m autistic myself, and my tolerance to loud music and noise has gone down significantly since the pandemic, but so has my ability to deal with huge crowds of people. There will be loud noises everywhere at the wedding, it\u2019s unreasonable for it to be a quiet/silent wedding unless it\u2019s an autistic person (or someone with an aversion to noise) that\u2019s getting married, and even if you were to have no music, there would still be drunk, loud people everywhere which would be hell for an autistic child. \n\nMaybe tell your brother this, because it\u2019s not just the music that will be loud, and the absence of music is already an unreasonable request, but the sheer number of people attending will probably trigger her meltdown too.", "He is inappropriate to ask that. He should have a caretaker (him or his wife will do) stay home with her while the rest of the family comes (or not). It's ok if she doesn't come to something that will upset her. \n\nNTA. Taking care of her needs (whether keeping her away from noise, or getting her headphones, or whatever) are ALL on him. She likely doesn't care about the \"party\" or wedding or fully even understand what is going on (for most 8 year olds, a wedding is just two old people who walk down the aisle and then kiss in front of everyone and everyone has cake- they don't care beyond that). He likely is upset about her ever being excluded from anything, and is sensitive about it because she's his child, but this is ridiculous. It's not HER day. It's not HIS day. And excluding music to accommodate her is making it all about her.", "NTA - it is YOUR wedding, music and dancing is the best part of the reception, it\u2019s what makes it a party. She is 8, her parents need to take her home when the music starts. Or you could make it a child free wedding, no kids under 10.", "NTA all the way. I got married earlier this year and because of my disabilities we decided not to have music; but I don\u2019t make my friends have no music when I\u2019m invited to their reception.

If there is a way to have a nearby quiet room that might be nice as well but this is your day and your brother and niece need to accept that.", "NTA - I'm all for inclusivity, but what Keith is asking for is ridiculous and unreasonable. HE will need find another solution to include Hailey.  That may be having her attend only the ceremony (assuming there will be no loud music) or having a special day for you, your husband and Hailey and have a special wedding celebration with her, or KEITH purchasing noise cancelling headphones for HIS DAUGHTER. \n\nNone of this is really your issue to fix.", "NTA.  You seem to want her to be comfortable at the reception so I suggest you work with a combo of suggestions.  Maybe you can have calming, softer music during the dinner so she can participate.

If he is not willing, then you will not be the AH if you can\u2019t work it out. \n\nI hope this helps.", "NTA, OP. \n\nWhen it's Hailey's wedding, then her issues should be taken into consideration. \n\nHowever, since this most definitely is NOT Hailey's wedding - nor her father's, come to think of it - then you're well within your rights to shut Keith down. \n\nKeith wants Hailey to be part of the festivities, and that's a kind gesture on his part (assuming that he's not pushing for this because he doesn't want to arrange for child care for her). However, he will need to realize that not all events and venues are going to be suitable for all individuals...and that Hailey's needs conflicting with the planned events is not grounds for the events themselves to be changed.\n\nBy all means, stick to your guns; I would do the same, were I in your shoes.

I can guarantee you Hailey doesn't want to be there, and if you try to do so, you're going to not only spoil a lot of your day, but cause some massive meltdowns in this child and she and your brother or his other family members may have to leave early. Your brother trying to force you to \"accommodate\" her is him struggling to deal with the fact he has a child that does not, and may never enjoy or want to participate in \"normal\" things. There is no way that a WEDDING can be altered to suit the needs and comfort of a child who can't stand loud noises or changes in her routine. \n\nI think you should compromise by seeing if you can take some special wedding photos that include Hailey, and perhaps have a special breakfast or dinner to celebrate the wedding in a manner she can participate in and won't overwhelm her.

She\u2019s 8, most of the reception should be after her bedtime anyway.", "NTA. Either 1) he makes the accommodations himself (headphones) or 2) leave his daughter home if she will be uncomfortable. Does she even want to go? Has he bothered to ask her how she feels? Having an autistic child myself, it would never have occurred to me to ask anyone to change their wedding for my child. Even my sister.", "> \u201cwe\u2019re not making any steps to accomplish her\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a fuckin lie, you guys are totally doing that, just not out of your own pockets\u2026 because it\u2019s NOT your kid and not your own problem. You guys are saints. NTA", "NTA. People have covered the topic well so I won't bother going over anything. Just wanted to add, because I hadn't seen it suggested, that depending on the venue of the reception a possible accomodation could be setting up a quiet room or a quiet corner where your niece could hang out if she gets overwhelmed by the noise. It's totally understandable if that's not an option, but if it is you could suggest it to your brother and if he turns that down he's being unreasonable.\n\nI also want to say that you're not refusing to accommodate your niece. Your willing to work to find a reasonable accommodation, but what your brother is asking for is unreasonable.", "Info: is she really that excited  to go?\n\n If so, would it be possible to do a private reception with her? She skips the official one but on another date everyone dresses up and have dinner togheter at her house? Maybe even recreate some special moments from the reception with her(cutting the cake,the first dance,...). I think this would be a great way to make sure she's comfortable and still participate in your special day.", "What eight year old WANTS to go to a reception anyway, even a neurotypical one?! Not to mention, I know adult autistic people who nope out of wedding receptions because they're too much. The kid can stay home and will likely have a MUCH better time anyway. No loud noises, no disruption to her routine, and parents won't be constantly attending to her and can have fun. NTA", "NTA. Bro should bow out of the reception since his child cannot handle music.", "NTA. I'm autistic and I'll be honest. The idea of a reception with music and socializing and changing my schedule (and maybe missing my bedtime) sounds like it would have been a nightmare for me, I can only imagine your niece may feel the same way. Your brother is not helping his daughter at all. He should have a conversation with her about what it's going to be like and what are some options that will help her (noise cancelling headphones, comfort objects, breaks, leaving early, etc) but it is quite literally his job as a parent to give his child the tools they need to operate as humans in the world. It's not to put them in bad situations to make them suck it up, and it's not to limit what everyone else is doing in a way as big as he's asking.\n\nA reasonable accommodation would be asking to provide some safe foods (or be allowed to bring some in), maybe to see the venue before the ceremony if possible so she can get used to the space, and again making sure to provide her with breaks, emotional regulation tools, and leaving early if it becomes too much. Has he even talked to her about the situation? There are age appropriate ways to talk about individual-centered accomodations. He may feel like he's being helpful but really he is not, he's trying to control the outside world to limit meltdowns instead of teaching her the skills to get through them herself. He is not granting her or teaching her agency, and autistic people are frequently seen and treated this way. We have agency, we can make our own choices, we are still people.", "As an autistic person, with an autistic child...\nI would NEVER expect anyone to adjust their wedding plans for me or my child. At most, I would ask for a rough schedule so I can prepare my child, and bring any appropriate items to help them be settled. \nOP, absolutely NTA. Your brother needs to realise that whilst his world revolves around his child, everyone else's does not.", "NTA\n\n>Hailey is very prone to meltdowns and gets extremely upset if her routine is changed in any way.\n\nI mean, does Hailey even want to go?  Even with noise-cancelling headphones, it sounds like this reception might be too much for her.\n\nCan you have a private mini-party with just Hailey, you, and your wife before or after the main reception?  Let her know she\u2019s so special she gets the two of you all to herself for a while.", "The fact that he knows his kid is sensitive to sound and hasn't bought sound dampening headphones  after years is telling.", "And no music\u2026.means no dancing? No first dance, no mother/so. And Father daughter dances.\n\nWTF are they going to do the whole reception with no music? Maybe if this came up when you started planning.l, you could do a short cocktail reception (IF you were inclined).  It with no music/dancing as an activity, no one will stay once they eat the cake.", "Seriously, I went to a wedding around that age. I wasn't on the spectrum or anything, I was just a kid. And bored out of my mind. Don't really remember  but I'm sure I was on the verge of crying or just straight up napping within the first hour of the reception. Came up for dessert though lol", "Even without the music it could get pretty noisy, with people talking, laughing, 100+ guests and probably servers and other type of staff at the venue. The brother van't expect a silent, sad party, with people walking on eggshells trying to be quiet.", "No way this is ableist.", "I agree with your first paragraph. Not your second. I think they shouldn\u2019t go out of their way to accommodate her at all. Plus, if she hates music, how would it be a party? Are the adults gonna drink in front of an 8 yo child? What could they even do that is fun?\n\n\nI think it\u2019s time she and her father learned people won\u2019t bend over backwards for them. This is a hard lesson unfortunately. However, an easier way to resolve it is noise canceling headphones. But she shouldn\u2019t get special treatment or treated differently. It sets a terrible precedent and doesn\u2019t make her feel good. Plus if there are other kids there, now they\u2019re gonna view it as her receiving special treatment and treat her poorly.", "I guess when I said \u201cmini-party\u201d I simply meant meet with Hailey in a private setting and do something with her that Hailey would enjoy.  Maybe a tea party?  I dunno - I don\u2019t have kids and don\u2019t know what Hailey\u2019s into.\n\nIf OP loves her niece and wants her to be a part of her day, but Hailey can\u2019t handle loud noises, I would think it\u2019s only natural for OP and her wife to take a bit of time out of their day to spend with a loved family member.  This isn\u2019t about getting \u201cspecial treatment\u201d.  This is about recognizing that some people might not be able to enjoy the reception, but maybe OP wants to spend time with them anyway.\n\nAll of this was predicated on OP\u2019s statement that she loved Hailey and wanted to include her.  I was just trying to think of ways that OP could do so without sacrificing her vision for her actual reception.", "What about children/adults without conditions that would love to be included but don\u2019t want to attend the reception? Would they be included? \n\n\nI\u2019m saying from a child\u2019s POV, they would view it as special treatment. Since OP\u2019s niece is attending, I\u2019m assuming other children are attending as well. Kids can be cruel and jealous. And OP\u2019s niece doesn\u2019t need that type of drama.\n\n\nYoung children do not understand her condition and especially will not understand accommodations."]}
