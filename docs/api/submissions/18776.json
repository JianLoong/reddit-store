Incredibly dismissive and MEAN \n\nYTA", "Soft YTA. Kay specifically reached out to you because she knew it would upset your bf and was subtly clueing you in on how seriously to take it (since she also told him directly). That was very kind of her and super respectful of your relationship. You dropped the ball on providing the support that was clearly needed. Losing pets is hard. He knows it\u2019s part of life - we all do - but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t hurt. \n\nSoft because I know you weren\u2019t trying to be an AH but you missed the context clues you were given here.", "YTA.\n\nWhen you say \"unfortunately that's the way of life\" it's a way of saying to accept it and move on.\n\nSo the instant he got the news of his dog's death, he immediately got the message from you that it's already time for him to accept it and move on, as if he shouldn't take time to feel the loss of his dog.\n\nYou might say that you didn't mean it that way. Sure. But just imagine someone telling you, \"I'm sorry to tell you that your mother died in a car accident an hour ago, but unfortunately, that's the way of life.\"\n\nI'm sure you didn't mean any harm, but it shows that you didn't understand that your bf would have deep feelings about the loss of his dog.", "Wow YTA \n\nThat was incredibly dismissive and cold", "YTA, \"that's the way of life\" is incredibly tone deaf, people are allowed to greive for any person or animal they loved. You pretty much told him to get over it and move on. You owe that man an apology.", "YTA. \"that's the way of life\" is so ... disconnected with the situation. You might have said \"we are having pizza for dinner\" with the same effect. He is right to be upset. You could have just kept to to \"I'm sorry for your loss\" and that's it. Now he knows you can't empathize with his grief or emotions, it's all \"that's how it is, another Thursday\" to you.", "\"To which I replied \"I'm so sorry to hear that, unfortunately that's the way of life.\"\"\n\nThis is one of the top phrases to NOT SAY to a person who has lost a loved one, whether it be a person or a pet.\n\nYTA!", "YTA, though probably accidentally.\n\nThat wasn't a kind thing for you to say and I would be so upset if my husband said that to me when I lost a pet.", "YTA.

Have a bit more empathy", "YTA are you serious? At your age you think that death is something you can just explain away? My little dog has been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer with a few months to live and I am am absolute wreck.

You were sort of accidentally the AH, texts lack tone and it's easy for intentions to be misinterpreted.

Marley may have been \u201cjust a dog\u201d to you, but dogs become a part of the family and it\u2019s truly devastating when one passes. I had to get my old dog PTS due to a brain tumour, and I was not stable for a long time afterwards even though I knew the time was coming. Even now when I think of him I tear up, and this was in 2018. I now have a dog who is 7 this year, and, touch wood, have plenty of time left with her, however, when I think of that one inevitable day I tear up. Dogs aren\u2019t just a pet, they\u2019re family and the bond you develop with them is like no other. So I say YTA for how blunt you were when he had just found out.\n\nSAYING THAT, your bf is also TA for how he treated you afterwards. Yes he will have been upset and angry, but there is still no excuse to lash out and say those things to you and bring up other factors/matters which are irrelevant to the situation at hand.\n\nTo help me through losing my old dog my mum bought me a photo box, and it has the card the vets issues and a pouch of some of his fur, and other little things from my dog in there. I also still have his pet passport. Maybe try getting a small memento for him for the dog. There are plenty of businesses out there who can do gorgeous things with putting the dog tag, collar, favourite toy etc. in resin and things like that. May be silly to others but may also help you and your boyfriend to move passed this.

It\u2019s going to be your effing end?? What on earth", "YTA. I'll admit to being raw as just lost two pets to age and illness. But I'd have been so hurt at that type of response. Basically you told him - so sorry, so sad, but what were you expecting. You didn't give him a place to express his grief, just told him to pull his socks and that he was over-reacting. I get if you don't have a close relationship with animals, that you may not understand the loss, but your BF was hurting and you were totally dismissive.", "ESH. You both need to realise who you are to each other. You should be more sympathetic, and he shouldn't have said what he did to you.", "ESH. You for reasons already explained, but your bfs comments are kinda disturbing.", "NTA, i get that the dog meant a lot to your bf and you tried to be as understanding as possible but him talking to you like that was completely uncalled for. its not your fault you don't feel that much sympathy towards a dog (which i doubt you even met)\n\nhe is just very emotional and hasn't gotten over the grief yet so give him some time and talk to him about it when the time is right", "Esh, where was yr compassion for yr bf grief? I guess it doesn't matter that's just how life is? If something happened to yr child would you like this response? He was looking to you for some general kindness and comfort, not sure whats wrong with you......Yr bf also sucks for the way he retaliated.", "NTA. Your comment in text form probably lost a lot in translation.  That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but a clarification seems warranted.\n\nAnd hopefully his anger isn\u2019t because he would use the pooch as an excuse to go over to Kay\u2019s to bang her behind your back and now can\u2019t.", "NTA, but just not to up the y t a count by one, you're not the biggest a-hole in this situation\nYou would've been better off without the \"that's how life goes\" comment (although I get what you mean and second it)", "You both are. I'm not an animal person, but your answer was odd. When my colleague's dog died, I left a small pastry on his desk with a note that said I'm so sorry for your loss. It costs nothing to be kind. That being said, your boyfriend's comment was weird and violent", "NTA but your comment might have sounded dismissive. It's enough to say that you are sorry for his loss.

Him being upset and calling you cold is understandable, but that particular comment was out of line.", "YTA \"unfortunately that's the way of life\" is one of the worst things you could have said to someone who is experiencing loss at the moment. That phrase sounds so very cold. He was right, people know how life works even without you mentioning it. He needed support and got dismissed by his girlfriend. I don't know what you can do to correct it besides to talk to him, apologize profoundly and hope he will forgive you.

That was... not a very empathetic response.  I'm not going to say you were an AH and meant it that way, as you do recognize he was understandably upset when he got home - so you (at face value)  you aren't completely dismissing his feelings.   \n\nI do know people that say that sort of thing around sad situations, I don't like it but people do process feelings differently.   Empathy comes in by putting yourselves in the shoes of the other person (who you know) and trying to process/respond from their point of view.\n\nYour bf is part of the suck because he reacted in a spiteful angry way and lashed out.  It might be because he was in a bad place, but it still doesn't excuse it or make it right.  If he hasn't shown any of these traits before then this is a bad situation where you both behaved badly.  You both need to fix it and move on, together.   If he's shown any sort of disdain or tendencies like this before, then think about if there are deeper problems.", "NTA, your boyfriend sounds unhinged. I feel like I'm going crazy watching all the Y T A s, you must have triggered a lot of dog lovers who are either teenagers, or a little unstable themselves.\n\nOk, so you were a little dismissive of his feelings.

I needed consolation from you, not a \"man up\"-esque comment. That hurt my feelings\". And then you would have had the chance to acknowledge that, apologize, explain your thought process behind what you said, and hug it out.\n\nPersonally, I can understand why you didn't anticipate straight-up grief over a dog he doesn't even live with anymore. I'm not sure that's normal for a well adjusted adult. Being sad, sure. Emotional reaction on this level? A little off. And I say that as a pet lover. I guess I'll be downvoted to hell for saying so, just wanted to send some sanity your way...", "ESH\n\nWhile you were definitely the AH for how you handled the news about this dog, he went AH the other way by threatening to \"effing end you\" for upsetting his dog.\n\nHe's a grown man, he's supposed to keep better check on his emotions than that.", "ESH", "ESH. Not everyone knows how to handle death perfectly, you made a mistake and said something that upset him.

You were cold and unsympathetic but his threatening you over getting his dog's face wet was scary!", "ESH. Your boyfriend threatened you in a violent manner over not being sympathetic enough.

You also didn't try to fix your mistake when he came home, apologise or try to make him feel better. \n2) after being so cold \"you told him to wash his dogs face\" basically telling him what to do to his pet while actually not giving a fuck about the loss of Marley. I can understand his response of you not caring about animals and being cold. As that's basically what you were. This was all in the same day. He's obviously seeing you in a different light and probably believes you don't care about his current dog.
