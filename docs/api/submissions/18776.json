Then my brother called to tell me he was on the way over, now my bf has a dog jar jar bink that was born the same year his mother passed and we had plans to shave and bathe him and grill food after. When my brother arrived we were in the process of bathing him and my bf made some almost threatening comments to me when I told him he needed to wash the dog's face to make sure all the fleas were not on his head such as \" he doesn't like water in his face if you upset my dog it's gonna be your Effing end.\" And looked at my brother and said \" she doesn't give a F about animals someone who's never lost a parent and cold as ice.\" I was shocked and embarrassed.

Incredibly dismissive and MEAN \n\nYTA", "Soft YTA. Kay specifically reached out to you because she knew it would upset your bf and was subtly clueing you in on how seriously to take it (since she also told him directly). That was very kind of her and super respectful of your relationship. You dropped the ball on providing the support that was clearly needed. Losing pets is hard. He knows it\u2019s part of life - we all do - but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t hurt. \n\nSoft because I know you weren\u2019t trying to be an AH but you missed the context clues you were given here.", "YTA.\n\nWhen you say \"unfortunately that's the way of life\" it's a way of saying to accept it and move on.\n\nSo the instant he got the news of his dog's death, he immediately got the message from you that it's already time for him to accept it and move on, as if he shouldn't take time to feel the loss of his dog.\n\nYou might say that you didn't mean it that way. Sure. But just imagine someone telling you, \"I'm sorry to tell you that your mother died in a car accident an hour ago, but unfortunately, that's the way of life.\"\n\nI'm sure you didn't mean any harm, but it shows that you didn't understand that your bf would have deep feelings about the loss of his dog.", "Wow YTA \n\nThat was incredibly dismissive and cold", "YTA, \"that's the way of life\" is incredibly tone deaf, people are allowed to greive for any person or animal they loved. You pretty much told him to get over it and move on. You owe that man an apology.", "YTA. \"that's the way of life\" is so ... disconnected with the situation. You might have said \"we are having pizza for dinner\" with the same effect. He is right to be upset. You could have just kept to to \"I'm sorry for your loss\" and that's it. Now he knows you can't empathize with his grief or emotions, it's all \"that's how it is, another Thursday\" to you.", "\"To which I replied \"I'm so sorry to hear that, unfortunately that's the way of life.\"\"\n\nThis is one of the top phrases to NOT SAY to a person who has lost a loved one, whether it be a person or a pet.\n\nYTA!", "YTA, though probably accidentally.\n\nThat wasn't a kind thing for you to say and I would be so upset if my husband said that to me when I lost a pet.", "YTA. Why did you have to add the \"that's the way of life\"? That's so immediately dismissive of the dogs death. You can't pretend to be sad for a minute?! You just moved pass his sadness.", "YTA\n\nYou dropped the ball and you know it.", "Massively YTA.", "YTA learn and practice empathy", "YTA - losing a dog is incredibly upsetting, and what you said was dismissive. My own dog passed away two weeks ago, I had her for 15 years and she was my best friend. Even strangers were sympathetic toward me, so it's unfortunate that someone so close to him wasn't more understanding.", "Are you normally this callous about things in general? YTA. Have a bit more empathy", "YTA are you serious? At your age you think that death is something you can just explain away? My little dog has been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer with a few months to live and I am am absolute wreck. The amount of times people have told me that it's just how life is... even if you just don't have those feelings and would feel that way if your loved one had passed away at least attempt to be a decent partner.", "YTA you've been too old for 2 decades to be saying  stupid shit like that to someone. Really? You have to ask?", "YTA\n\nGrief is grief. If you were experienced intense grief and your BF was indifferent to it, how would that make you feel?", "YTA. That was wildly insensitive", "I feel like im losing it in these comments here but ESH, yeah you flubbed supporting him but your boyfriend came home and THREATENED you when you were trying to help?? and then immediately turned to shit talk you to *your brother* like you weren't literally standing right there helping him with his geriatric dog with fleas. jesus christ. he's fully entitled to his feelings but he's *is not* entitled to threaten you over fucking *dog shampoo.*", "ESH, your message did seem tone deaf but I feel that your boyfriend\u2019s threat that upsetting the dog will be \u201cyour effing end\u201d seemed concerning to me.", "ESH except your brother.", "Had me in the first half. You were sort of accidentally the AH, texts lack tone and it's easy for intentions to be misinterpreted. Definitely should have apologized / clarified to avoid any sort of festering resentment.\n\n\nHOWEVER, your bf upped the ante by considerably. A certain amount of emotional turbulence can be written off as a result of the situation but this is a different level of magnitude and downright concerning.\n\n\nESH except your brother.", "YTA \n\nImagine someone tells you their family member dies. And you say \u201cunfortunately that\u2019s the way of life.\u201d Do you feel like an AH? Yeah cause you are. A lot of people, me included, like animals more than people.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re TA because you really weren\u2019t sympathetic. Marley may have been \u201cjust a dog\u201d to you, but dogs become a part of the family and it\u2019s truly devastating when one passes. I had to get my old dog PTS due to a brain tumour, and I was not stable for a long time afterwards even though I knew the time was coming. Even now when I think of him I tear up, and this was in 2018. I now have a dog who is 7 this year, and, touch wood, have plenty of time left with her, however, when I think of that one inevitable day I tear up. Dogs aren\u2019t just a pet, they\u2019re family and the bond you develop with them is like no other. So I say YTA for how blunt you were when he had just found out.\n\nSAYING THAT, your bf is also TA for how he treated you afterwards. Yes he will have been upset and angry, but there is still no excuse to lash out and say those things to you and bring up other factors/matters which are irrelevant to the situation at hand.\n\nTo help me through losing my old dog my mum bought me a photo box, and it has the card the vets issues and a pouch of some of his fur, and other little things from my dog in there. I also still have his pet passport. Maybe try getting a small memento for him for the dog. There are plenty of businesses out there who can do gorgeous things with putting the dog tag, collar, favourite toy etc. in resin and things like that. May be silly to others but may also help you and your boyfriend to move passed this. Think you both need to apologise to each other.", "Imma be honest\u2026 I don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve responded like that if it was a human and not a dog. \n\nSo yeah. You lack sympathy. \n\nYour boyfriend is emotionally charged after your comment and taking it out on you rather than having a conversation. \n\nESH", "That threat was intense. It\u2019s going to be your effing end?? What on earth", "YTA. I'll admit to being raw as just lost two pets to age and illness. But I'd have been so hurt at that type of response. Basically you told him - so sorry, so sad, but what were you expecting. You didn't give him a place to express his grief, just told him to pull his socks and that he was over-reacting. I get if you don't have a close relationship with animals, that you may not understand the loss, but your BF was hurting and you were totally dismissive.", "ESH. You both need to realise who you are to each other. You should be more sympathetic, and he shouldn't have said what he did to you.", "ESH. You for reasons already explained, but your bfs comments are kinda disturbing.", "NTA, i get that the dog meant a lot to your bf and you tried to be as understanding as possible but him talking to you like that was completely uncalled for. its not your fault you don't feel that much sympathy towards a dog (which i doubt you even met)\n\nhe is just very emotional and hasn't gotten over the grief yet so give him some time and talk to him about it when the time is right", "Esh, where was yr compassion for yr bf grief? I guess it doesn't matter that's just how life is? If something happened to yr child would you like this response? He was looking to you for some general kindness and comfort, not sure whats wrong with you......Yr bf also sucks for the way he retaliated.", "NTA. Your comment in text form probably lost a lot in translation.  That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but a clarification seems warranted.\n\nAnd hopefully his anger isn\u2019t because he would use the pooch as an excuse to go over to Kay\u2019s to bang her behind your back and now can\u2019t.", "NTA, but just not to up the y t a count by one, you're not the biggest a-hole in this situation\nYou would've been better off without the \"that's how life goes\" comment (although I get what you mean and second it)", "You both are. I'm not an animal person, but your answer was odd. When my colleague's dog died, I left a small pastry on his desk with a note that said I'm so sorry for your loss. It costs nothing to be kind. That being said, your boyfriend's comment was weird and violent", "NTA but your comment might have sounded dismissive. It's enough to say that you are sorry for his loss. The 'that's how life works ' might be interpreted as 'dogs die, get over it '. Even though I know you didn't mean it like that. I wish your boyfriend realized that too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

In what way did you mean it that it wasn\u2019t incredibly callous?", "YTA Yes, he knows that is life. A little compassion would have went a long way.", "YTA It's devestatig to lose a pet.  That's the way live goes it's absolutely not the thing to say.  What can I do for you, or I'm so sorry, etc.  It sounds like you brushed it off.

No empathy whatsoever\u2026 YTA, seek help", "Esh You for your lack of sympathy (\u2018That\u2019s the way of life\u2019? Really?) and him for threatening to end you if you got water on his dog\u2019s face during a flea bath. Him being upset and calling you cold is understandable, but that particular comment was out of line.", "YTA \"unfortunately that's the way of life\" is one of the worst things you could have said to someone who is experiencing loss at the moment. That phrase sounds so very cold. He was right, people know how life works even without you mentioning it. He needed support and got dismissed by his girlfriend. I don't know what you can do to correct it besides to talk to him, apologize profoundly and hope he will forgive you. I heard that once from someone I considered a friend on a day of my loss and I'm still hurt someone would chose to say THAT instead of sorry and possibly offering a hug. Because newsflash, we know!", "YTA\n\nYou need to apologize. Your text was bordering on sociopathic. You really can\u2019t be borderline sociopathic and also so dumb that you need Reddit strangers to explain this to you.", "YTA. Woof. What a cold and obnoxious thing to say.", "\"That's the way of life\"? Really? Is that the best you can do for the man you live with? Had a kid with? Wtf is wrong with you?

That's the way of life.", "I agree with the soft YTA. It did come off as dismissive. I would also add that he is pairing this loss with the loss of his mom. OP- Definitely apologize, be sweet to him, and try to be understanding of his mood for the next several days.", "This! No one is acknowledging that the bf was borderline verbally abusive.", "Was he supposed to have that conversation while washing someone else's dog in his home the day after he lost his?", "Yes, we all know this....but there is absolutely no need to throw that in someone's face whose dog just died.", "I guess when grandma dies it's ok to say \"sorry for your loss, unfortunately that's the way of life.\" \ud83d\ude44", "No shit, we all know this and don't need it pointed out especially not when in the middle of grieving", "At my dad's wake, a \"family friend\" said to me, \"All good things come to an end I guess.\" I was gobsmacked. It's not all that hard to just say \"I'm sorry for your loss\" whether it's a person or a pet. A grieving person is pretty aware that nothing lives forever and doesn't need to be told that as if if they're an idiot."]}
