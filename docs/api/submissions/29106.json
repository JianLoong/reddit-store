She cleans them when she can but the dirt doesn\u2019t come off. So my wife doesn\u2019t like letting her wear them. This morning she tried to sneak and wear them, wife made her take them off and offered a different pair of sneakers. Our daughter didn\u2019t want to wear the black hirachis that she was offered, she wanted to wear the the red air forces. She had a red and black outfit on, and the shoes matched it. \n\nSo she was of course frustrated that my wife said to change it, and ended up changing her whole outfit. Wife got mad and told her to stop the attitude, daughter left out for school. I told my wife I think she should just let her wear the sneakers, and that it\u2019s not like CPS is gonna come just because her sneakers are dirty. My wife says that she shouldn\u2019t be wearing dirty sneakers and wants to throw them away. She said she\u2019d throw them away today but she wants to do it while our daughter is at school, but i think she should just leave it alone. And to just pick and choose her battles wisely.

I also think that the dirty nature of the shoes should be irrelevant. Shoes get dirty. It sucks and they're expensive to replace.

Waiting to steal something from her own daughter while she's away because she doesn't like the way it looks or whatever else she might think about them is what your wife seems to be doing and it's not okay.

She has a pair of red Air Force 1\u2019s that she got in 6th grade for her birthday, she bought them herself. We were poor and in the shelter and she had enough money saved up to buy herself something nice. Fast forward she\u2019s in 10th grade and still fits them, but of course they\u2019re dirty. She cleans them when she can but the dirt doesn\u2019t come off. So my wife doesn\u2019t like letting her wear them. This morning she tried to sneak and wear them, wife made her take them off and offered a different pair of sneakers. Our daughter didn\u2019t want to wear to wear the black hirachis that she was offered, she wanted to wear the the red air forces. She had a red and black outfit on, and the shoes matched it. \n\nSo she was of course frustrated that my wife said to change it, and ended up changing her whole outfit. Wife got mad and told her to stop the attitude, daughter left out for school. I told my wife I think she should just let her wear the sneakers, and that it\u2019s not like CPS is gonna come just because her sneakers are dirty. My wife says that she shouldn\u2019t be wearing dirty sneakers and wants to throw them away. She said she\u2019d throw them away today but she wants to do it while our daughter is at school, but i think she should just leave it alone. And to just pick and choose her battles wisely. I don\u2019t mind the dirty sneakers, they\u2019re old and she likes them and it\u2019s not hurting anyone. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Throwing things away while she's out of her house is just going to cause a huge problem with their relationship and damage the trust. \n\nIt's clothes. So long as your daughter is within school dress code, clothing just isn't worth the battle.

I really want those cards! They were mine, not hers and they meant something to me. It's been over 20 years since she did that and I'm still ticked off.

I\u2019m a psychologist and I see this kind of dynamic a lot, so I\u2019ll try to explain what this all looks like from your daughters perspective. \n\nI want you to picture that you\u2019re a 15yo girl in this dystopian capitalist hellscape that we call society. Every media outlet is telling you that you\u2019re either too thin or too fat and no one will ever love you until you\u2019re *perfect*. You\u2019re going through huge hormonal changes that make it feel like an alien is controlling your body. There\u2019s a 50% chance you\u2019ll be sexually or physically assaulted in your lifetime, so you better learn to defend yourself and always be on the lookout for danger. Basically, everything already seems really overwhelming and difficult to a 15yo. \n\nAnd then, in the midst of all this, you have your mom. Your mom who says she loves you and wants what is best for you. Your mom who promises to never hurt you and to always protect you. Your mom who is your *primary role model* for how women should behave in this world. And then your mom lies to you, steals from you, and hurts you, all in order to control you. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, you\u2019re left to sort out that betrayal on your own and ideally learn from it. And what will you learn - maybe that it\u2019s okay to lie and steal? Or maybe that you\u2019re *supposed* to be mistreated by people who love you?\n\nI\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re a good parent and you don\u2019t want your daughter learning *either* of those lessons. Please try to explain to your wife why this is hurting your daughter. She needs to re-evaluate her priorities - the appearance of sneakers should NOT be more important than her daughters happiness. \n\n(And for the record, I also used to pretend I wasn\u2019t upset when my mom threw out my stuff. And then as soon as I finished high school, I moved halfway across the country and now I see my mom *maybe* once a year. In other words, your wife needs to realize that, pretty soon, she won\u2019t be able to control your daughter anymore. And she may be throwing away her last few years of meaningful connection\u2026 over *sneakers*)", "NTA\n\nAnd you'd better take those shoes right now, then, because you know your wife will do it anyway.

She meant well but I HATED it, and one day I had a total shit fit/breakdown at finding yet another treasured book gone for good. She stopped doing it that day but the damage was done, and from then on I clung to literally everything and my house looks like a vintage junk shop. Your wife will do psychological damage if she continues to steamroll over your daughter's wishes for her own aesthetic preferences. Let people keep the things they like!!", "NTA your daughter is old enough to decide what she wants to wear. Your wife needs therapy if she thinks what she is doing is okay. If your wife throws out your daughters shoes she needs to buy her a new pair of Air Force ones.

And if she does throw them away, there needs to be consequences on your wife and you need to move heaven and earth to get them back.\n\nYour wife is bullying your daughter and you need to step up in a big way and stop it.", "This is actually going to be really harmful to your daughter mentally.\n\nHer mother deciding to go through her things and throw them away at her whim can manifest as anxiety in your daughter: she will start feeling like she has no control over her belongings, like everything she has and cherishes can be taken away from her at a moment's notice, and it will mess her up mentally. It can manifest as a big insecurity in her too, that could lead to bigger problems (I know a person who, with a similar insecurity brought upon by having no control over their belongings, let it fester in to hoarding later in life)\n\nSo this is definitely harming your daughter. And not only her - this will harm the relationship between your wife and daughter, too, the longer it continues.\n\nMy best friend had a mom who, with no warning, took and threw out her entire alt-fashion wardrobe, saying that \"she's a big girl now, she should dress like one too\".

I could\u2019ve put myself and my kids (don\u2019t have any but the point stands) through college debt free with the cards I had.\n\nMoral of the story is, don\u2019t let your wife throw away shit that isn\u2019t hers. Not only could it carry immense sentimental value to your daughter, it may actually be valuable or collectible if not now then later. Granted, worn out shoes and jackets are less likely but in that case it\u2019s the sentimental value that matters not the collectible value.\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna pick a battle, pick this battle.

And frankly if your wife doesn't stop then I think she should bc that's so back handed and disrespectful. Not to mention that even if she doesn't go no contact she probably won't ever let your wife in her house, especially not alone, and will probably develop some sort of issue surrounding her sentimental belongings. That could develop into anything like hoarding or not letting anyone close to her things, even her future partners.", "You need to sit your wife down and have a serious talk. Every time she throws away some thing that your daughter cares about, that stupid woman is telling that girl that she doesn\u2019t care about her, and that her obsession with image is a worthy justification to hurt her. Every time she does something like that, she is damaging the relationship and that damage will last a lifetime.

If you take away the things that are precious to a kid - especially without warning and while they're not present - it teaches them to be afraid that the things they love will vanish without warning. This can lead to incredible physical and emotional insecurity, where they believe that the things they own are never safe, and by extension they're never safe or in control of anything. You can see plenty of grown adults in this comment section telling you about how they're still dealing with that insecurity decades later, how it deeply harmed their relationships with their parents, and how they still either hoard things or can't bear to let themselves own things because they're still afraid of them disappearing.\n\nI'm sure your wife means well and doesn't intend to hurt your daughter by doing this (and to be honest she's probably doing this because of her own insecurity-related problems), but this can't be allowed to go on. You need to be firm about this. And individual and/or family therapy might be invaluable for all of you guys.", "Yeah, my mom tried this. Exactly ONE time.\n\nI was 10 yo, and still remember it.

Mind you, she didn't buy any new ones FIRST, so it left me with one pair of pants to wash and wear wet to school for over a week till she got paid. \n\nI was furious when I got home and found out. Her excuse? They were getting too small for me to wear. I said okay and plotted my revenge.\n\nNow it so happens my mom had this one dress, a really expensive designer dress given to her as a gift. Next day after school, while Mom was at work, I took to myself that dress and a pair of sharp scissors and had a party. I put what was left of the dress on my mom's bed to find when she got home, and went off to play.\n\nBoy howdy! She was screaming mad when she saw it.

You ever take anything of mine again, I'll take everything you own for the rest of your life!\" Only 10, but I meant every word and she knew it. She didn't even punish me for it because she knew SHE was in the wrong.\n\nNow I hope, for your daughter's sake, she's not as hard and cold and hyper-possesive as I was.

Her mum was the manager of a charity, part of their work was collecting clothing donations to give to people who needed them. They didn't really need clothing in smaller sizes, and one day my friend showed up with a big bag full of them. Including the leather jacket which she had said she grabbed specifically because she knew how I had wanted one for years. I've owned it for five or six years now, it's definitely at the point where it's peeling around the cuffs and neck. I love that thing, and definitely have a sentimental attachment to it because of the story of how I got. I'd be devastated if something happened to it. OP said that his daughter also had a leather jacket that his wife threw away without telling her, which made me so mad.

As long as it is not taken to extremes, this will set her up for excellent financial management in later life.\n\nYour wife on the other hand, does not like reminders of poverty and is lashing out at the daughter. It's not about the sneakers, it's not about the daughter, it's all about the wife and her baggage.\n\nIf it were me, I would talk to them both seperately and see if they feel there is any truth there, and gently nudge the wife towards a few sessions to a therapist - This may be the tip of a trauma iceberg that is best handled before it festers. The same could be true of the daughter, maybe she is just thrifty - but maybe she is also carrying trauma and this is another iceberg tip.\n\nWe always think of poverty as something that is temporary, but the reality is that aftershocks follow you the rest of your life afterwards and some people stumble on this more than others.\n\nI would also say that if there is truth here - your wife throwing away belongings against your daughters consent could be causing massive emotional damage by trampling on her triggers like an angry bull in a china shop - I cannot how important it is that your wife stops as intentional or not, that is abuse.

And a 15 year old ain't equipped for that yet, so it's up to dad to PROTECT HER from the trauma her mother is about to inflict. It's about so, so much more than a pair of grubby shoes.", "Maybe it's time to \"get a reward\" and use all this food, not having to buy groceries for some time - this way you can enjoy being \"thrifty\" with your money for some time.", "My mum had a very impoverished childhood with no stability at all. She still hoards food and non perishables. \n\nHer sister does the same thing, it doesn't matter how comfortable they are now in life they can never get rid of the little \"for emergencies\" instinct.", "Agree with this, it may be different to her but if you find old memorabilia of hers, like crumbles photos or even something she's kept and said ok then throw this away it's old and crumpled", "Maybe OP should actually do this (or maybe not fully throw it away, but get it out of the house). Take something of hers she loves, that you may have said you don't like, put it away, tell her you tossed it, let the fight ensue, use all her arguments against her, and then finally return it and tell her see, don't do this to our daughter.", "Ok that is an easy answer, but think about it, unless he is 100% sure he can get full custody with no visitation (and nothing here suggests that would happen) then divorcing her just means his kid(s) have half their time with their controlling mother AND NO ONE TO COUNTERACT HER. \n\nOP put your foot down. Tell your wife to get over it and that if she throws away the shoes behind your daughter\u2019s back she is causing trauma. Do a search to back up your statements and show her the articles.", "He should leave his wife because she has thrown her childs old clothes away? Step away from the ledge.", "Thanks. It\u2019s nice for people to understand!", "Agreed. She shouldn't throw it away. But her pain is her pain and shouldn't be taken out on her daughter.", "That's a a good idea.    I've taken  loads of stuff to the local cat charity.     There is a consignment store that I can take some household goods to.    \n\nI can't drive any more so I have to rely on my family to run these types of errands with me.    I think I can  get my daughter to do it for a cut of what I make.", "Honestly, I like keeping it around as a source of comfort. When covid happened I had more than enough to give away to friends and family when the shops were more than half empty most of the time. You haven't experienced sincere thanks until you've been the one thing standing between someone and not being able to wipe their ass!\n\nIt's also nice for absorbing price fluctations, such as when the attack on Ukraine and wheat shot up by 40% for 5-6 months (As a fun side note, I added \u00a31K to my gas meter the day the attack happened and saved myself at least a grand on gas that winter - the price is fixed when you buy the topup)\n\nIt was a crazy suprise when covid happened for most, but the reality was we were crazy overdue for a pandemic. I feel the same way about a significant global famine, particulally with global warming.", "He absolutely has to stand up to her. The kids need to know he has their back. My dad stood by and watched. I miss him, but he made his choice.", "Protecting a child is not at all a frivolous reason to leave a spouse.", "It really helps! I've found that I only donate stuff I don't particularly like and keep the good stuff. The problem is that I think almost everything is the good stuff! Luckily, other people are willing to pay me good prices for the good stuff :)\n\nI hope your daughter agrees to help; it might even be a fun way to spend time together!", "I miss my dad too, same thing.", "Any time with her is good times.  \n\nYeah, that's the thing... I only get good stuff.   I've got great taste (don't we all?)_  so the stuff I donate will actually make them some money if they price it right.    Either way someone else who appreciates cool stuff will get it for their hoard."]}
