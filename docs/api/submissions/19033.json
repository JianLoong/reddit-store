If this behavior is unusual then I think that would add more credibility to this. If that is the case that is what I think ultimately needs to be addressed; it is not uncommon for embarrassment to turn into resentment but it is not productive.\n\nHowever if this sort of lackadaisical approach to cleaning up after himself and arguing about it is more generalized, then I would be more concerned. Particularly if he tends to throw it back at you and demands you take care of it.", "NTA- maybe he was embarrassed and that\u2019s why he reacted the way he did. I do pedicures on my boyfriend but I\u2019m okay with that sort of thing as I used to be a homecare nurse lol but if he did his own toenails I wouldn\u2019t want to clean up his mess. Next time you clip your nails just leave them everywhere and see if he notices lol. Haha I\u2019m a bit petty sometimes though", "NTA - he\u2019s grown, you\u2019re not his mum or his maid.
