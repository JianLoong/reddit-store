To this I responded with, \"I don't feel like I should have to cook dinner...I don't feel like I should have to do the laundry...I don't feel like I should have to take care of the kids...because you're the woman and I'm the man.\" My point was not to signal my unwillingness to do those things, rather to show her how silly it was to use gender stereotypes to divvy up the work. She immediately tore into me about how I don't see her worth if I'm not willing to take out the trash, how chivalry is dead, etc. I told her I'm happy to take out the trash, literally all the time, I just don't appreciate her saying certain work is a man's job. She had to go pick up a grocery order and insisted she bring our 2 year old because 'it's her job'. \n\nI tried to talk to her today about it and she's still upset, thinking that I really *do* feel like those things should be her job because she's the woman.

But crap like this - 'it's your job because you were born a cis straight man\" is both regressive, setting progress back,  and a lovely (if minor) example of things like \"patriarchy hurts men, too.\" Sometimes you have to go *BIG* to get across the ludicrousness of internalized misogyny.

It's easier right now for her to be mad at you for you \"believing in gender roles\" than it is to confront her OWN belief in gendered roles. She's really mad at herself, not you.
