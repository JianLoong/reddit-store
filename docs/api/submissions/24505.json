However, yesterday, unprompted, she says, \"I don't feel like I should have to take out the trash because you're the man and I'm the woman\". To this I responded with, \"I don't feel like I should have to cook dinner...I don't feel like I should have to do the laundry...I don't feel like I should have to take care of the kids...because you're the woman and I'm the man.\" My point was not to signal my unwillingness to do those things, rather to show her how silly it was to use gender stereotypes to divvy up the work. She immediately tore into me about how I don't see her worth if I'm not willing to take out the trash, how chivalry is dead, etc. I told her I'm happy to take out the trash, literally all the time, I just don't appreciate her saying certain work is a man's job. She had to go pick up a grocery order and insisted she bring our 2 year old because 'it's her job'. \n\nI tried to talk to her today about it and she's still upset, thinking that I really *do* feel like those things should be her job because she's the woman.

But crap like this - 'it's your job because you were born a cis straight man\" is both regressive, setting progress back,  and a lovely (if minor) example of things like \"patriarchy hurts men, too.\" Sometimes you have to go *BIG* to get across the ludicrousness of internalized misogyny.

It's easier right now for her to be mad at you for you \"believing in gender roles\" than it is to confront her OWN belief in gendered roles. She's really mad at herself, not you.

I hold the door for someone because it's the polite thing to do and it has nothing to do with gender. Letting a door shut in someone's face is a rude thing to do in general.", "typical man. making his wife do emotional labor over his  weaponized incompetence.\n\nheavy /s, obviously.", ">As soon as it\u2019s a gender role AITA post someone will roll out the \u201cmental load\u201d\n\nAlso \"mental load'' isn't a thing.\n\nBuy a calendar (hell if your kids are at smartphone age just use your smartphones and sync events they need to be in the loop on)\n\nBuy some post-it notes\n\nAnd have a basic routine.\n\nYour \"mental load\" significantly drops\n\nThe people who complain about \"mental load\" are the ones who wind their selves in to a right tizzy over shit they don't need to worry about for 5 months about or don't need to worry about anyway.", "I\u2019m sorry but if the wife is too physically weak to take out the trash she must have an illness. I live by myself and never have I thought \u201cwow I need a man\u201d because *the trash* is too heavy. And I\u2019m by no means physically big or strong.\n\nAnyways, NTA OP. It\u2019s also really annoying to be told to do something if you\u2019re already doing it. \n\nEverytime my mum\u2019s birthday or something is coming up she\u2019ll be like \u201cremember to get me something nice wink wink\u201d and this has led to a situation where she thinks I\u2019d never do anything for her of my own will and I \u201calways need to be reminded\u201d. Like I *would* get her a present even if she didn\u2019t tell me to. Same happens with pretty much everything. I love my mother so much and she is an amazing mother, this is just one thing that really grinds my gears, always making me feel like I\u2019m incapable of doing anything unless she reminds me first.

Men don't automatically think slaving away with garden work or fixing a never ending list of issues around the house as hobby work. Not to mention simple household work like the laundry or keeping the house clean can be rewarding jobs. \n\nPersonally I think your conclusion here is a little toxic to both men and women.", "So, women don\u2019t experience the pride of a job well done? All work typically serves someone. Whose car is the man fixing? Is it his wife\u2019s car so she\u2019s not stuck at home all day or can get to her job? Is it his car because he has the older one so his wife can have the newer, more reliable one?\n\nFixing a car is only \u201cfun\u201d if you\u2019ve decided it is. I\u2019d much rather do the laundry, personally.\n\nWork is work.", "Yes. I'm not even a housewife but give me the fucking cocaine back in coca cola. Cowards", "Normally, it's judged by the frequency, not the options.\n\nYour argument about 2/3 options is it being wife's responsibility and equating it to the majority of time being her job. Is an incorrect assumption.\n\nAn example of this would be who cooks the meal. Option 1. Husband \nOption 2. Wife\n\nBy your logic, it's divided equally, but by frequency, the wife might be cooking during the weekdays and husband during the days off or vice-versa.

I was assuming everything around the house to be considered work if one is a dedicated home-stayer.\nWe take kids to the doctor and \"make appointments\" even when we both do work.

It's not the big deal, but it is what it is.\n\nHonestly making those things someone's job is not the best. All should be everyone's job. If I see my husband's job that I can do, I'm happy because I know he comes and sees \"yay my job is done\" and he's relieved. Then he does some of my job and I feel great when I come to fold annoying laundry and it's been folded already, happy day."]}
