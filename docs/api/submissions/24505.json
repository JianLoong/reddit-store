However, yesterday, unprompted, she says, \"I don't feel like I should have to take out the trash because you're the man and I'm the woman\". To this I responded with, \"I don't feel like I should have to cook dinner...I don't feel like I should have to do the laundry...I don't feel like I should have to take care of the kids...because you're the woman and I'm the man.\" My point was not to signal my unwillingness to do those things, rather to show her how silly it was to use gender stereotypes to divvy up the work. She immediately tore into me about how I don't see her worth if I'm not willing to take out the trash, how chivalry is dead, etc. I told her I'm happy to take out the trash, literally all the time, I just don't appreciate her saying certain work is a man's job. She had to go pick up a grocery order and insisted she bring our 2 year old because 'it's her job'. \n\nI tried to talk to her today about it and she's still upset, thinking that I really *do* feel like those things should be her job because she's the woman.

But crap like this - 'it's your job because you were born a cis straight man\" is both regressive, setting progress back,  and a lovely (if minor) example of things like \"patriarchy hurts men, too.\" Sometimes you have to go *BIG* to get across the ludicrousness of internalized misogyny.

And if you're doing a fair share it shouldn't impact it and make it clear who's duties are what.", "The problem is that she is feeling that she does more than you around the house and she\u2019s feeling frustrated. Idk if she\u2019s right or not, but the only way for you guys to figure that out is to communicate, and not get defensive when the other says something you don\u2019t like. You\u2019re trying to solve a problem, not win the argument. Sit down with her, after the kids are in bed and ask her how she feels and why she feels that way and DO NOT ARGUE OR GET DEFENSIVE. Really listen and take in what she\u2019s saying. She should do the same with you. If you guys can\u2019t talk without it turning nasty, go to a couples therapist. You may only need a few sessions to learn how to communicate productively instead of trying to score points against each other. The goal is to solve the problem and be more empathetic to each other.", "Why don't you and your wife sit down and make some chore expectations so you're both on the same page", "So the two of you need to sit down and communicate and come up with a fair way to divide the tasks so that you're both happy - and agree to check in after a month.", "These commenters just can't compute when a wife is the sole AH. It just doesn't work for them.\n\nIn this scenario they twist, and invent and backflip to the ends of the earth to try and either reduce the blame on the wife or increase blame on the husband.\n\nThey do this with strategies like:\n\n* Invent made up scenarios that weren't in the post and then have those scenarios conveniently paint the woman as right and man as wrong.\n* Diagnose the AH wife with a mental disorder or trauma so that she becomes a puppet having her strings pulled by an external force so its not her fault.\n* Ignore bits of the post that don't suit their agenda. for example, chastising the husband for not communicating even when he said he did.\n* If the OP is the man, nitpick the wording and ignore the actual issue. Or accuse the man of leaving info out.", "yeah lmao \"mental load\" of placing a garbage bag outside the door? get out of here, there's literally nothing to remember. If you can't handle this you're just incompetent.", "Generally I\u2019d agree - but often then the woman does end up with the majority of the tasks.cooking breakfast- need eggs on grocery list.

I happily do everything else.", "That\u2019s a weird line of logic, is she supposed to do every chore at the house without her husband or kids helping?", "maybe cuz she just doesn\u2019t like trash", "I don\u2019t know how it became \u201ctraditional\u201d for men/kids to take out the trash. I lived alone for 15 years, yet somehow taking out the trash has become my BFs job. \n\nGranted we live in an apartment complex and taking the trash out involves taking it to the dumpster down the street. I prefer to change from work clothes to PJs and he periodically Will go outside to smoke or make a call. \n\nBut if I have a long weekend that he doesn\u2019t I\u2019ll usually ask for the keycard to the dumpster so I can take whatever I need to the trash right away.", "Because maybe she doesn\u2019t want to. Maybe her spouse is supportive of her and isn\u2019t a judgmental asshole like you and actually wants to help where they can.", "No but \u201ctraditionally\u201d women didn\u2019t work. If she wants to assign traditional roles then she should not work and tend to the house and children.", "Yes, let's do that cage match after all!", "The Zuck v Musty is the first step. At first I hated it, but you may be right. Encourage them to all fight each other is increasingly extravagant ways. This could work.", "When you look simply at the acronym sure.\n\nBut look at the difference in tone and sentiment. When a wife is an AH here you will get comments like \"gentle YTA\" or \"I'm sure she didn't mean it\" or \"she was tired.\"\n\nThis sub doesn't give that same grace when its the other way.", "100% this. OP's wife definitely needs to use her grown up words. But if she's letting things pile up and then snapping she may wait until those grown up words are \"I can't do this anymore. Here's the information for my divorce lawyer.\" It's not OP's job to start the conversation but if he wants to solve the underlying problem he may have to initiate the conversation.", "I have no aversion to bringing my trash to a dumpster.", "I\u2019ll go on the record saying that as a single person I have an aversion to taking out the garbage. Like I viscerally dislike it but it\u2019s got to get done.", ">If the OP is the man, nitpick the wording and ignore the actual issue. Or accuse the man of leaving info out.\n\nAre you thinking about that post a few weeks back where a guy got called TA for using the word babysitting even tho he used it for both himself and his wife?", "Ahem\u2026..I believe it\u2019s called weaponized incompetence. Per reddit rules, there is no such thing as regular incompetence.", "He said she puts it on the patio and he takes it the rest of the way", "Whoever notices the bin is full should empty it.\n If I'm busy in the kitchen, and the bin is full,  I sometimes take the bag out and put a new one in.

Normally a person is capable of working and taking care of the home.\nWhat on earth would one fill 8 hours a day with - every single weekday?", "It was an honest question on why it was \"a thing\" that she doesn't do, as there isn't much to do with the house and she's ...in the house.", "Not that one specifically but its a good example. There's also lots of posts where the husband might say that his SAHM doesn't work which obviously refers to paid employment at a company or something but everybody here purposely misinterprets it to get offended and say \"SAHMs do work!\"", "What if the dumpster is across the parking lot? Or involves a trip down the road?

Some people have to do more than just put a full bag in the trashcan in the garage.", "Children make a lot of mess and need a lot of care, it's truly hard to overestimate how mess can come with children. And cooking can be a very involved and time-consuming task. You say what is normally possible, but actually historically it's been a lot more common for people to live in multi-generational homes etc to spread that workload further. Many many people actually aren't able to keep up with full time work and all at home duties, but there's a lot of stigma in admitting that.", "Go take care of a house and children for a week straight and find out.", "Raising kids is a full time job.\n\nBoth parents will still need to split housework, as caring for and educating children is time consuming.  \n\nOnce all children are in school full time, it's a different story.", "You\u2019d be surprised at how much actually goes on behind the scenes \u2026 there\u2019s a crap ton of work to be done at any given time, and especially so if someone in the household has dietary restrictions/requirements. \n\nEven without special care requirements, usually if one partner is SAH and is doing a lot of extras to save money - for starters, meal prep.

I wash windows, deep clean the furniture, clean out the food trap in the dishwasher, decalcify the appliances (we have very high mineral content in our water), clean screens, maintain gardens (he mows the lawn and clears snow) \u2026 I deep clean the garbage receptacles, fridge and oven \u2026 all the stuff that has to just get done. \n\nAnd I work full time.
