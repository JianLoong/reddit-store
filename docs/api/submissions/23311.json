I just started it about 2 months ago and I haven\u2019t pushed it out to the general public yet. For now, I\u2019m selling to family and friends, just to get some feedback before I do a hard launch.\n\nSo, yesterday was my nieces birthday party. She is turning 7. My sister messaged me 2 days before asking me if I could make my niece 2 dozen cupcakes, with added decorations. I told her that would be fine. After we ran through the decorations, and what stuff she would like added, I sent her the cost of how much it would be. She didn\u2019t reply for the rest of the day.\n\nThe next day she messaged me asking me if I had started the cupcakes. I told her she never replied to the cost of the cupcakes so I hadn\u2019t started. She told me she didn\u2019t reply because she didn\u2019t see why she had to pay. I told her this was a business I\u2019m running and I can\u2019t just give out stuff for free, she then sent me a long text just saying that I was very entitled and selfish because I care about money more than my nieces happiness. She then said the most she would pay me for my cupcakes is 30 dollars, then proceeded to cash-app me 30 dollars. \n\nSo the day of the party, I went to the store and bought 2 dozen cupcakes, with those 30 dollars she so happily lended me. When I arrived, and handed her the cupcakes she got very angry and took me outside to talk. She said that I was such a \u201cpetty bitch\u201d and a selfish brat. We got into an argument but I ended it because kids started to arrive. The rest of the party was fun, but when I got home my sister texted me saying that I handled the situation like a 2 year old. I told her that nothing is free and that this is a business, not the Salvation Army. I can\u2019t afford to be just giving out free cupcakes like that, especially with the type of decorations she wanted. She proceeded to call me, and we got into a huge screaming fight which ended in her blocking me.\n\nToday, I woke up to a call from my mother. She asked me about the situation because apparently my sister had told. I told her and she said that I could\u2019ve just made the cupcakes for this one party, and put the business aside. We ended up getting into an argument too.\n\nMy whole family is angry at me now, but I cannot afford to be giving out cupcakes for free, especially with the small size that my business it at. My sister has still blocked me, but I think this whole situation has been blown out of proportion.

If they ask for free stuff, kindly respond \u2018Unfortunately it\u2019s not in my budget right now to provide free things to anyone, and as my family member, I was hoping you would be willing to support my small business, not use it to your advantage for free desserts.

She probably would have hounded you about the cupcakes until you gave in so it was probably best to take the money and buy cupcakes.
