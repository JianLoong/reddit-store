In abuse situations like that (not saying that's what this is specifically) it ALWAYS starts out small and maybe a little weird and then escalates. It is the testing of boundaries, that's how abusers pick their target.  \n\nHave a convo with ur daughter so u can go over how to set her boundaries and deal with him and so she knows u are there for her (abusers hate kids who have strong support).  Mention something to the principal, but honestly, they prob won't do much until something truly bad happens.  But then at least they have a record of complaints. Also, if u know any other teachers in the school that u like and /or are friends with ask them, there is usually gossip.  \n\nAlso, yea it's weird, but I wld say that it was a sexual comment that veers into kink that the teacher prob thought the kids wldnt pick up on. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

In this case teen children. Do not just let this go. Depending on where it leads use your best judgement from there, but don't ignore it. Repeatedly sweeping things under the rug is how predators thrive in these environments.
