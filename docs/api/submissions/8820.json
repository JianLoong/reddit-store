In abuse situations like that (not saying that's what this is specifically) it ALWAYS starts out small and maybe a little weird and then escalates. It is the testing of boundaries, that's how abusers pick their target.  \n\nHave a convo with ur daughter so u can go over how to set her boundaries and deal with him and so she knows u are there for her (abusers hate kids who have strong support).  Mention something to the principal, but honestly, they prob won't do much until something truly bad happens.  But then at least they have a record of complaints. Also, if u know any other teachers in the school that u like and /or are friends with ask them, there is usually gossip.  \n\nAlso, yea it's weird, but I wld say that it was a sexual comment that veers into kink that the teacher prob thought the kids wldnt pick up on. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

I'm sorry this happened to your daughter.", "Is there any possibility that you\u2019re not getting the whole story ? Just such a bizarre thing for anyone to say ?  Did your child feel super wired about this ? What exactly did your kid say ? I tend to think a lot of parents like to react to a lot of things and have super soft feelings ? Personally- I think that helping kids develop the right language is a best strategy ? Like ? FUCK OFF ?", "NTA. That\u2019s 100% a sexual comment, and even if it wasn\u2019t- WTF??", "Even interpreting this in the kindest way possible, it's still bonkers.", "I don\u2019t think it was sexual. He was probably making a point, similar to when you tell kids \u2018would you follow your friends off a cliff\u2019. Often we should not be putting ourselves in situations we have to take anything for anyone\u2026\n\nDid your daughter find it weird or is the teacher someone who would make such life lessons? I saw comments assuming your daughter and her friends were uncomfortable\u2026I didn\u2019t see that in your post.\n\nI\u2019d ask the teacher what it was about and to explain, don\u2019t assume it\u2019s sexual.\n\nThen if you disagree you can inform the principal.\n\nYwbta to make it sexual without asking, you can ruin a career of an otherwise good teacher. I wouldn\u2019t let it slide, in case it is a bad teacher, I\u2019m just more investigative than accusatory because we do need the good ones in the world and can\u2019t accuse anyone who confuses us.", "I feel like it's possible that it wasn't sexual, but still seems really inappropriate just on grossness level alone.  I'd be talking to the school about it either way. NTA", "Same what the actual fuck! Especially during these virus filled times, this is disgusting and so inappropriate.", "Thank you. I\u2019m feeling very weirded out that a lot of people are not seeing the severity/nature of this remark clearly.", "Had no idea. Learn something new every day. Off to Google spit kink . . . .\n\nEdit: NTA", "I think we're all confused because spitting in someone's mouth is not a normal sexual thing either. It's inappropriate, and horrific either way. But I think we're all trying to figure out... WTF?\n\nI am not a virgin but I certain am a virgin to having my mouth spit in. And would like to remain one.", "How is this NOT sexual?!", "I can't think of any way this isn't a sexual comment", "How is this not sexual?!", "No.  That will only warn the teacher not to mess with this particular girl.  The administration need to be made aware of this behavior.  Because, trust me, the daughter is not the first girl this teacher has made and inappropriate remark to nor will she be the last unless something is done about him.", "I seen a post yesterday about a guy who works six days a week so he can support his wife and his wife\u2019s live in gf and he\u2019s not allowed to talk to other women even if they\u2019re related and someone said THAT was a kink thing\n\nThat seems less related to sex than swapping spit", "Parents probably shouldn\u2019t assume everything their kids say is a lie.

How about your mom? \n\nShould a teacher say something to a student that isn\u2019t appropriate to say in a workplace or to a family member they care about? \n\nPeople say careers get ruined over accusation but my experience has been it takes multiple transgressions over many years for a teacher to be held accountable and some aren\u2019t even then. \n\nTaking sex out of the equation doesn\u2019t make this an okay thing for a teacher to say to a student. Worst case, one of the \u201cgood ones\u201d learns to be more careful about how they express themselves which, if they are indeed a good one, they will welcome since we all have room to improve.", "You\u2019re worried about the teacher?\u2026Seriously?!

You should know better :/", "I just found out it\u2019s a sexual kink, I never knew this and like a lot of people here didn\u2019t get the sexual aspect of it. And by no means am I shaming anyone for having a fetisj or am I a prude, I just never knew this.\nSpitting on its own is considered assault in some states and is gross and disgusting! Now I know it has a sexual component it\u2019s even more scary s teacher would say that.", "I Literally gasped when I read that. \n\nOP NTA \nThis is wildly inappropriate and I feel a meeting with the school is highly in order", "I've never heard this either way, but it sounds like some gross fetish.", "I can't believe you're even deliberating what to do?\n\nIn what context is a comment like this innocent? Who cares if it's not \"specifically\" sexual (which, spoiler alert, it is) - it's still highly inappropriate!!!", "Ok that\u2019s your opinion.\n\nPersonally, and many kids I\u2019ve known and see out in the world, can appreciate the hard hitting analogies or examples. Some teachers are easier to stand because they know how to use sarcasm or grossness the way kids do/get it.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the teacher was not gross or was totally in line. \n\nI\u2019m replying to OP (not every possibility/opinion), saying they thought it\u2019s sexual. I think that is jumping the gun.\n\nI said OP should ask the teacher what that meant and why.\n\nTalk to her daughter about how that teacher is in general etc.\n\nJust cause one parent is disgusted does not mean we jump all contextual info and discussions - to report this as something abhorrent before even understanding it. He may actually be a good teacher who read the situation and communicated contextually - and you\u2019d have attacked him before even asking?\n\nBut hey do you, add your vote, no need to debate mine. I just know I hated those parents who come crucify the one teacher who actually listened to students etc. Because THEY don\u2019t get it/their kids. \n\nI remember being a teen and getting in trouble for joking inappropriately (sex). We got crucified before anyone even asked what they overheard. They went and reported us when we had no idea anyone even heard it.\n\nLo and behold the next couple years, the kids who did get knocked up were not in our circle. Our jokes are easy to hear and shutdown. We became the example for the class, and no other kids were speaking up about actual sexuality (cause hey, look how jokes around it were handled). Well those kids got knocked up, those of us talking loudly and joking were aware and we were not the ones who actually got pregnant or didn\u2019t understand etc. We were comfortable with the topics and could\u2019ve told the staff who was most likely to actually do the deed had they asked. Nobody bothered even asking what they heard, we got notes to our parents saying we were soliciting sex (yea that landed well at home). \n\nBut hey\u2026why ask when you can judge a snippet of a conversation\u2026that nobody was hiding even.", "Did I say it\u2019s ok?

NTA.", "No.. that\u2019s some really bad advice!", "I didn\u2019t say to accuse anyone of anything. I said it was gross regardless of whether it was sexual or not and OP is NTA to say as much. \n\nSorry you got in trouble.", "It is gross I agree.\n\nMy point was simply ask the teacher first to get the context. I didn\u2019t get why I\u2019m being jumped on for that\u2026\n\nLol I didn\u2019t mind being in trouble - it was a funny misunderstanding to us kids. But just weird the adults honestly didn\u2019t stop and think we wouldn\u2019t have been soliciting sex at that age \ud83d\ude05", "It's not even kind of borderline. This was harassment and OP should bring clear sources that the comment really only has sexual connotation to the table. What the hell.\n\n(Just to be clear - I entirely agree with the rest of your comment, it's just not borderline.)"]}
