NTA I would be calling sending an email to the principal, and the superintendent. THAT IS TERRIFYING.", "NTA. I don't know if it's sexual or not, but it's definitely unhinged and I'd be reporting this to literally everyone I could, lol. WTF?", "YWNBTA I'd say if youre concerned it doesn't matter how it was meant. You have every right to let the principle know at the very least you don't want a teacher speaking like that to your child.", "NTA. This is spit kink and is HIGHLY SEXUAL in nature and completely inappropriate. The wording itself comes directly from that kink community. \n\nIt is beyond inappropriate for an adult teacher to say that to your daughter. I\u2019m so glad she didn\u2019t realize how bad that comment was, but I have to rip the blinders off from the people who think this is \u201cjust a weird comment.\u201d Yeah, no kidding, it\u2019s a niche sex kink that a teacher implied he would preform with an underage teenage girl.", "He was testing her boundaries. Please report it. If he is grooming her he may be grooming others. Even if he claims it isn\u2019t \u201csexual\u201d it\u2019s rude and unprofessional.", "NTA\n\nReport it. Even if it wasn't meant to be sexual, that's still extremely inappropriate to say anyone, let alone to a teenage girl.", "NTA\n\nThere's really no good situation for a teacher to say that to a student. Joke, sarcasm, sex thing, doesn't matter. That's an inappropriate comment. As someone who has worked as a teacher, that guy needs to get in trouble for that.", "NTA\n\nWhether it was gray area not-sexual or gray area sexual (which I personally think it was in the context of your daughter's innocent but slightly awkward comment) is.... not relevant. The point *is* that it was a gray area!", "Rule #1: don't wait for proof that an adult is a threat to your child.  Whatever this is, it needs to be reported immediately, preferably in person..  Teachers who do not maintain appropriate boundaries with students often turn out to be abusers or have other issues.  I gather this is a male teacher, and there's clearly a sexual aspect in that case, but it's way out of line regardless.  At the very least, you'll establish that your kid is not to be messed with, and it will make it hard for the administration to look the other way on any other issues with this teacher.

Whether it was intended to be sexual or not is irrelevant because it\u2019s disgusting and highly inappropriate.", "NTA. I\u2019m studying to be a teacher and please for the love of everything good and holy REPORT THAT BASTARD", "NTA. WTF is wrong with that teacher? Why is that where his mind went? That\u2019s super gross. That needs to get nipped in the bud right away.", "NTA.  Context doesn't even really matter here.

If it\u2019s your daughters teacher have you considered talking to them first. Don\u2019t bring up anything sexual just say they way they spoke to her was inappropriate and you want their version of events maybe they were trying to make (a very horribly bad) joke and once told it\u2019s inappropriate they won\u2019t do it again. If they brush you off/react inappropriately with you or are not her teacher go to the principal.", "NTA; hard to tell if actually sexual. However it was extremely aggressive and degrading", "You need to find a friend to confirm the story first. I know you trust your teenage daughter but you're talking about someone's career. Tell her to visit the principal relating \"my parents said to talk to you\" with a friend who will verify the incident.", "Wouldn't call that sexual but inappropriate for sure it sounds like. What about talking to the teacher first?", "That is a messed up thing to say. Definitely report it!!", "This needs to be reported ASAP!  But one thing I would do before going to the school is call the parents of your daughter\u2019s friends who witnessed this and have them write out a statement on what happened. This way you get to them before the school does and they can\u2019t find away to sway the narrative. NTA", "NTA and for the love of all that is holy, REPORT IT.  And have your daughter really pay attention in class because a comment like that is probably not a one-off or random coincidence.  I'd bet there have been other inappropriate things.", "I don\u2019t know if the teacher is into this particular kink but yes it is a kink.  I would definitely have a discussion with the principal.  I would be very wary of grooming by the teacher. \n\nNTA", "I cannot think of this being anything other than sexual. It\u2019s a common thing in porn, especially from like a teacher to a female student. \n\nI\u2019m a female, btw, and I\u2019ve watched plenty of relatively vanilla porn and know this, if it makes any difference.\n\nNow, to be honest, even as a parent myself I don\u2019t know what action you should take. I would probably try to talk to another parent I trust or someone trusted in my friend group who is a mandatory reporter and see how they think you should proceed.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you and your daughter.", "Shld u nuclear at this step no, but u shld report it. My mom was actually a lawyer for school districts and the number of cases she had where teachers were straight abusing/or in the grooming stage was shocking.  Almost every single time the parents were like no they are just a real nice person and great teacher, until she had to sit down with them and go though step by step what that teacher did, and then it hit them.  In abuse situations like that (not saying that's what this is specifically) it ALWAYS starts out small and maybe a little weird and then escalates. It is the testing of boundaries, that's how abusers pick their target.  \n\nHave a convo with ur daughter so u can go over how to set her boundaries and deal with him and so she knows u are there for her (abusers hate kids who have strong support).  Mention something to the principal, but honestly, they prob won't do much until something truly bad happens.  But then at least they have a record of complaints. Also, if u know any other teachers in the school that u like and /or are friends with ask them, there is usually gossip.  \n\nAlso, yea it's weird, but I wld say that it was a sexual comment that veers into kink that the teacher prob thought the kids wldnt pick up on. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I don't know if it's sexual but it's gross and not something a teacher should say to a student.", "What the hell are you doing during sex!

I had a male teacher in highschool who was extremely friendly to me and made weird remarks about my outfits, haircuts, etc. I thought it was normal, but he ended up getting fired for having an inappropriate relationship with another student.  I graduated and he started to message me on Facebook constantly. 5 years later he kept trying to get me to come see him, bring my daughter so he could meet her, really any reason for me to come to his house.

If I was offended at work for example I would talk to that person first then if they escalated or dismissed me I would go to our manager.

And regardless, please don't say shit like that tl my kid.\" And see what they say. \n\nI suppose it's possible this teacher is just really weird and would be horribly embarrassed if they realized what they said/ how it sounded??

As a former teacher, the parent needs to report this directly to admin and/or a guidance counselor. There will be a full investigation... including interviewing almost every student. This is not one where you have a conversation with the teacher first.", "I have been thinking about it for hours and can't figure out why he would say it. The conversation was that her friend wasn't feeling well but had to close at work tonight and my kid as a joke was like \"I'll close for you, I'll take one for the team.\"", "Agreed. Im also a former teacher and a teacher educator. This isn't about a grade or a dispute over a consequence. This is a safety concern.", "He took that to mean something sexual, and responded inappropriately.\n\nReport it, immediately. This person does not belong in a school.", "He said it because he was implying that he'd spit in her mouth to ready it for her to perform oral sex on him. I dont really see how this could be taken any other way than sexual. Not only would i report him id insist she no longer be in his class and have zero contact with her. Honestly if i was you id be explaining it all to her and asking if she even feels okay staying in that school. This is so beyond inappropriate its borderline sexual harrasment of a minor."]}
