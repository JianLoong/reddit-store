I'm not missing a month without seeing my kids AND paying thousands of dollars. I don't give a fuck what plans she may be planning. \n\nI said fine. Then you pay for it and it will be on my time. She said that I have more money than her. I said no, you just don't want to dip into your vacation fund.\n\nSo I said I will happily pay for both of them to but they go on your time and you plan your vacation around their absence. Now she's trying to complicate it by offering me a week of her time but that needs to go through the court. I don't have time for that.

Your solution is perfect, too. Send the boys during her two weeks while she is on vacation. The ball is on her court now. Good luck!", ">Plus she's playing games because the extra week would be after camp and her vacation so she could back out and say it wasn't legally binding or come up with some bullshit which will make matters worse.\n\nINFO: does she have a history of playing games and being diffcult/manipulative with custody and payment?", "NTA. This is a discretionary cost that is very expensive. I make a good living and I would struggle to be able to afford this. You all need to compromise. Use 1 week of your time and 1/2 of her time; each of you pays for 1/2 of the camp. That\u2019s fair.", "......so for arguments sake:  your custody is the first 2 weeks of July.  The camp is the first 2 weeks of July.  Her custody is the last 2 weeks of July.  And her Vaca is the last 2 weeks of July.  \n\nAnd she wants you to pay $4k and not see the kids for the month of July?  Ya, no.  HARD PASS.  \n\nIF the camp was week 2 and 3 of July where you each lost a week, then MAYBE......as long as she paid half.  \n\nBut your compromise is valid: SHE wants them to go to the camp on your time, SHE can pay for it.  Jeez.  The nervy entitlement........", "NTA. This seems like a great compromise.  But definitely go through the courts if you think there might be shenanigans.\n\nWhy can't she pick a different 2 weeks to go on vacation?  Summer is at least 8 weeks long.", "You guys have this backwards. Shared custody works around the kid\u2019s schedule. Doesn\u2019t matter if soccer is only on her days, you split the costs. \n\nKid\u2019s schedule needs to be prioritized. He shouldn\u2019t miss out on a vacation with the mom just because it falls on your week, you are only hurting the child. Forget about you and your ex-wife\u2019s pride.  Grab a calendar, black out all the days where he will be away at camp or vacation, family gathering, then split the time after that.  If it her week and it\u2019s your mom\u2019s bday, he goes to the bday. Kid comes first.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why can\u2019t she send them on her time and take her vacation while they are at camp?", "Your kids will likely benefit from going to camp and also seeing both parents. Since they need to come first, it would be fair if you each split the cost 50/50 and each get the kids for 1 week while they spend 2 weeks at camp.", "ESH\n\nFFS, why aren't you splitting it evenly? It's a really easy split - $2000 each and one week of your custody time. I'm saying everyone's TA because if this is how you guys communicate you both are putting the kids and their wellbeing  in the middle of your bullshit.", "Why can\u2019t y\u2019all split it and split the weeks? One of her weeks and one of yours, and 2k from each of you.", "ESH, do what is best for your kids. You may have to be the bigger person, which I usually don\u2019t advocate for, but here I\u2019m advocating for the 8 and 10 yr old. Your post is all about you and the ex getting one up on each other.  Stop. Ask your kids what they want. Do they want camp and vaca with mom or just camp? I\u2019m sorry your ex isn\u2019t a good coparent.", "NTA, but yall might have to go to court for this if you have a set custody plan that you cant deviate from then.", "ESH- coparenting is hard. Best thing would be to split thebweeks and the cost.   \n\nPlus- do what your kids want.  \n\nI do get it that you need to change weeks through the court.. but yeah get after it. Split the difference", "YTA for letting your hostility toward your ex affect your children's opportunities. You'll go a lot longer than a month without seeing them once they're older if you don't start valuing their feelings. If you weren't so busy complaining to strangers, you could've done a simple switch where, even though the schedule may fall on entirely one parent's time, *you could trade a week with your ex to even things out.* \n\ni.e.: you normally get them the first two weeks of the month and your ex the latter two weeks; in this example camp falls during the first two weeks. You could trade so that you get them the first and third weeks, and your ex gets them the second and fourth; now, they're at camp for the first two weeks, at your place the third week, and your ex's the fourth week. \n\nStop making life harder on everyone for no reason.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIF YOU want your kid to go on a camp, you need to do it during YOUR weeks. YOu don't get a vote about activities during HER time. YOu can only OFFER. She is fine to decline.", "YTA. You two should be agreeing that since camp is two weeks out of four that you each get one of the remaining weeks of the month. And, if finances allow, both pay for half the total cost of camp.", "Why can\u2019t they start camp on her second week and continue on your first week. That way no one will have to go a month without seeing them. And she can get her vacation after you second week is up.", "NTA, but if you can why not try and get a court ordered adjustment for the summer before anything is finalized so neither of you lose time", "NTA if everything is 50/50 she needs to pay half, anyway. It\u2019s not about who makes more money but meeting the kids needs halfway.", "and get it in writing!", "Yup. I coparent well and fully agree with your comment. We work around the kids wants and needs, which is why we trust each other and why we don\u2019t get into situations like OP\nMy son goes to an expensive two week camp. My ex paid and signed him up. I\u2019m happy my son has this opportunity and grateful my ex coordinated as well as paid for it. Our convo has been: we\u2019ll both miss him; he\u2019ll be with one of us the week before camp, the other the week after. \nLots of room for compromise and common sense when you are solution oriented and prioritize what\u2019s best for the kids", "She wanted to take them with her", "Why would she? HE wants to send them to camp.", "Came here to say this. Split the cost and the time equally", "Because the camp sessions and our custody schedule don't overlap", "Agreed. It\u2019s pretty clear from the tone he sees his kids as property not people. I feel for them", "I agree ESH too. You're absolutely right. The kids matter here and this isn't about one upmanship. The best compromise really, would be if they booked the camp during an overlap period whereby it only works out that each parent misses one week each, and to split the costs evenly. \n\nI do think $4000 for 2 kids for 2 weeks is hugely expensive though.", "Helps if you read.  Court has to be involved and ex isn't willing to pay anything because it impacts her vacation", "Totally but it\u2019s the kids that want to go? \n\nOP has said he\u2019s fine with them going on HIS time but she pays, again he can only OFFER and she\u2019s chosen to decline \n\nKinda just sounds like neither parent is willing to compromise ESH and pity for the kids if they really want to go, that should be more important", "So do you have anything planned for when you have them?", "A reasonable plan. sounds like she is a great mom - holidays with her kids is a good thing.", "Uh where does it say that?\nOP has said it\u2019s the kids that want to go and they can\u2019t agree on who pays and when", "Are you the mom?", "Did your bias against fathers and men allow you to even read the post?", "So what?", "There is no overlap. The camp runs two two week sessions.", "Because the camp schedule is such that it falls when I have them or she does.", "Can't you compromise in some other way to ensure you don't lose that time? Like, take back 2 weeks at a later date?", "And you can't just give them back for a week - why is this such an insurmountable issue? Do you have a legal agreement that makes it impossible for you to trade time?", "YOU want them to go to that camp. So send them during YOUR time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr make her an offer SHE LIKES and is willing to accept. - Everything else: Tough luck for you.", "Why do you think MOM losing her time is preferable to dad losing HIS time?", " It all custody agreement can be flexible - op has explained that.", "A week? It's a month of not seeing them.", "SHE wants them to go to the camp, SHE wants him to pay and SHE wants it to be on his time.", "I think both parties should have equal time with their child, and if the dates of the camp can't be adjusted to ensure that this is possible, then there needs to be flexibility as to when the custody dates are in order for whichever parent had to sacrifice 2 weeks for the camp can recoup the 2 weeks back at another time.", "TRADE 1 week from your typical schedule.\n\nAs you have the kids 1 week, they go to camp 2 weeks, she has the kids 1 week, you both revert to trading off every 2 week after that. She can have a two week vacation on the next 2-week cycle of her time. Or, alternately you have them 3 weeks (your 2 week + 1 of her weeks), they go to camp 2 weeks, they vacation with her 2 weeks (one of her week and one of what would have been your weeks except you got the week before camp), and you both revert to trading off every 2 weeks.", "It's like he didn't even read", "This is a court order. She can back out at anytime and claim her time. There is no way to know she will keep up her end of the deal because let\u2019s see, she doesn\u2019t want to contribute to camp(because it will take away from her fund, she wants him to pay it all and give up his two weeks so she can go on a vacation. Does this sound like a person who will keep up their end of a verbal deal when the court ordered agreement is in their favor?", "That's not how custody agreements work. They are already predetermined and the only way to change them is going to court.", "So you will have to accept that you can only decide what happens during YOUR time.", "So you mean the mother can pay :)"]}
