I put my mom\u2019s name in and then my dad\u2019s name in.  My school called my mom to question her about it.  This was a private Catholic school so keep this in mind.  My mom said she would talk to me about it when I got home.  She started asking me about it with that look parents do when your in trouble.  When I told her all about the questions I proudly said I figured out their names b cause of my cousins calling them Aunt this and Uncle That.  My mom immediately started laughing and was no longer cross.  The thing is my whole side of dad\u2019s family called him lets say Uncle Square where as his actual name was Circle.  The only other name I heard of was Uncle Zigzag but it was a silly name so I could tell not a real name.  \n\nI unintentionally implied I was an affair child and that my mom cheated on my dad. Not even close to the truth I just picked up on the wrong name.  My mom had to call the school to explain what happened and that I was indeed my dad\u2019s kid.
