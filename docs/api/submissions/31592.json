It's honestly none of your parent's business. As long as the kids and mom are cool with it, nobody else's opinion matters.

No. The only person who has a valid opinion is your wife, if she\u2019s ok with it then NTA.", "NTA. I agree. It can be a cute family thing.

Your dad needs to chill.", "NTA. \n\nYour dad is concerned about a \u00ab\u00a0bad\u00a0\u00bb habit that your baby took (which is actually cute) WHILE he should be concerned about the image he is giving to his grandchildren. \n\nYOU should put strong boundaries to protect your wife but also your children to this kind of toxic behaviour. Especially for your daughter who is already 5yo and can clearly understand what is going on. \nDo you think it\u2019s good for her to see family mistreating her mom ? Her brother ? Would you like your daughter to repeat this behaviour or to be the victim of it ? \n\nI don\u2019t think so. So you know what to do for YOUR FAMILY\u2019s sake. \n+ \n\n1/ It\u2019s your family not his. \n\n2/ It clearly does not hurt anyone feelings except the one who should not be concerned about it.\n\n3/ Your son is only 2 years old for God sake ! How can he get THAT mad at a baby for something like that ? This is what is concerning for me. Personnaly I will not feel comfortable to let my parents with my babies if they have a short temper about things that don\u2019t really matter. \n\nI Hope you reassured your wife about setting strong boundaries with your parents because not only she saw her children being yelled at for no reason but she then has been insulted by your moms behaviour.", "NTA but your dad is. Stand your ground because at the end of the day this is not his child, it's yours and you have nothing against your children calling your wife baby, and neither does your wife.", "NTA. Congrats on breaking free from your upbringing. Dad is ludicrous. He thinks he has authority over what names you're allowed to let your kids use within your own family. Also deluded if he thinks your kids are upset about being taken away from some guy who was yelling at them.

I work with young kids and sometimes they call me the names their parents use on each other. \u201cThanks honey\u201d! It\u2019s cute. Enjoy it while it lasts.", "NYA.\nIt\u2019s giving me lady and the tramp vibes \u201cdarling\u201d and \u201cJim dear.\u201d It\u2019s actually so sweet and cute but in saying that I do think as they get older your kids should call her \u201cmum\u201d or whatever variation they use instead of the name you personally use for her. But the only opinion who counts is your wife\u2019s and as long as she\u2019s okay with it the it\u2019s fine.\n\nEdit to add: it\u2019s also important that they learn her legal name (as much as she hates it) for safety purposes. If they get lost or someone gets injured and they need to call for help ect. I work in retail and the amount of lost kids 9/10 years old that only know their parents names as \u201cmum/dad\u201d is astounding.", "YTA \n\nSounds like you have no idea how to teach a child proper respect in how to refer to adults. You children are kids, not idiots, they can be taught the difference on what is and isn\u2019t ok to say to a parent or adult. You are the problem. You ruined thanksgiving for everyone because you\u2019ve allowed poor and rude behavior from your kids. Well done.", "YTA lol", "NTA- I mean it\u2019s weird but hey.

I personally hate the whole babe, baby thing, but that doesn't mean I get to go around and say no one gets to use those terms, ever. If the actual person being addressed doesn't mind then it's no one else's business.", "When my son was a toddler, he'd call me \"babe\" sometimes because that's what his father called me. It's really not weird unless you deliberately make it weird.", "He\u2019s a toddler. Sometimes he uses Mama, sometimes he uses Baby. I call my wife baby a lot so he picked up on that.", "Depends on the kid really. I\u2019ve seen just as many kids barely talking sentences as I have ones that can speak clearly and voice what the want. I\u2019ve also seen kids that there\u2019s a mix just depends on the words. My nephew at 2yo very clearly said the word \u201cpsychotic\u201d but couldn\u2019t say \u201cdog\u201d or \u201ccat\u201d. His sister at 2yo knew how to use a certain curse word right and in a full sentence. Most memorable for me was when she told some old guy that asked her if he could pet her hair to \u201cget away from me you creepy old f**ker\u201d at the top of her lungs.", "Shit for a little bit I called my mom \"woman\" because my sperm donor did until she told him to stop. \n\nNTA and good on you man", "Right, but it\u2019s still unusual.

To be clear your parents were dead wrong and rude as all hell and well done for standing up for your wife but that particular nickname could get your kids into trouble used in public.

Well, you\u2019re NTA, your dad needs to chill.", "One of my best friends in junior high called her dad by his first name. She explained to me that as a baby/toddler, her older half sister (different father) called him by his first name, so as she learned to talk and identify people/things, she'd picked it up from her sister.  Her dad was awesome and didn't mind at all.\n\nWhen my half sister was born when I was in high school, I made a conscious effort to never call my stepmom by her first name while talking to my baby sister.  To this day, I'll still say to my my now-grown sister, \"Well, did you tell Mom?\" like she's suddenly going to start copying me.", "I didn\u2019t say there was?"]}
