She is the kids mother. This is way easier than all the fighting about holidays and back and forth. \n\nLet me give a different perspective. My stepmother was invited to my maternal grandmothers house for Christmas and Thanksgiving and all the holidays. She bought her aging mom who would sit and talk to my grandma about old lady stuff. She loved our family dinners. \n\nMy parents maintained one of the most cordial divorces ever and my dad did some crap during the marriage. I never saw it. My stepmother knew he had a child and that child would be his priority. Heck I even told her when I met her. \n\nMy stepmother was a trusted adult. She was there for me and I was able to talk to her about things because I didn\u2019t see any animosity from my mom. She was treated with kindness from my mom\u2019s family and my dad\u2019s family. \n\nMy mom went to my dad\u2019s big family reunions for years because she was connected to me.

Mom would sleep at the hospital so I could get a break.

After a few awkward years, my parents mutually agreed to just have holiday dinners and birthdays together.  Not vacations or anything like that, but stuff where it made it less stressful on everyone as opposed to splitting things up.  My dad would get weird about it when he had an SO, but that was on the rare side.  My mother made it abundantly clear to any SO that the father of her children was always welcome in her house - that was an upfront boundary and it was respected.  When my dad was invited over for events, he acted like a proper guest and my SO was def the co-host.  This togetherness didn\u2019t happen with extended family/ex-inlaws, but just my parents, their SOs, myself/siblings, eventually our SOs.  That being said, my dad somewhat separated himself when he had an SO, and that was a bummer as a teenager, but as an adult, I understand why a girlfriend of his didn\u2019t want to do that.  It was sad for me, though - I loved that my family lived and let live, and that divorce meant change, rather than territoriality and a harsh severing.\n\nI will tell you that their being able to do that has made a tremendous difference in my life.

She their mom, so you are going to have to find a way to navigate your feelings and a relationship with her, at least a minor one.

It's not a way I could live. But people do and they are super happy. I do think you have a right to either be in the picture too since you are about to be step mom, or take 2 separate pics with each parent. I don't care what anyone says- once youre that serious, there is to respect all the way around and that includes for YOU.", "I'm gonna go against the norm and say you're NTA for feeling this way. I personally wouldn't be able to handle this situation of seeing his ex and mother of his children at every special event. It's not even about jealously, it's out of respect for myself. \n\nHowever, in saying that, I wouldn't put myself in this position or I would've got out of the relationship. It's too messy for them to change their family traditions now, just for me. \n\nAlso, if the ex wife is as horrible as you've explained, why the hell does his family welcome her with open arms? It's hard to believe that they would tolerate her for the sake of the kids. I dunno, the whole situation sounds bizarre.", "NTA!  You have every right to be upset.  First,  have your fiance talk to his kids.  If they want her there,  you're stuck.  But, If they don't care,  and it's your future in-laws doing the inviting,  have your fiance put his foot down!   Yes, you're fiance will be always tired to her because of the kids, but that doesn't mean that you have to.", "No they need to learn separation.", "NTA. If she's coming over all the time and hanging out why are they divorced?", "NTA\n\nIt would piss me off too.", "Dump him, he never moved on from the ex. Find someone who puts you as equal.", "My kids were very young when we divorced.  I never remarried. He lived in the next state so I would take the kids over for Xmas since my dear MiL and ex's sibs and I were all very close.  We alternated custody.  His wife #2 refused to speak to me even if we were doing dishes together. Wives #3 and  #4 and I got along great.  Wife #5? 6? punched me when I came to my youngest' high school graduation.  I think he might have reached wife #8 by now.  This is not made up.", "YTA You're signing yourself up for a life of misery. Don't get married. The ex is the kids' mom. You didn't include their ages or the length of your fianc\u00e9's first marriage, but those are very important details. The ex has been in their family much longer than you, and she isn't going anywhere. Given the way they behave, it seems like the grandparents view her as their daughter; they can't alienate her without risking access to the kids.\n\nYTA because you have no place to stand here, and you're running at the hornet's nest with your pokin' stick firmly in hand. If you continue trying to \"put your foot down,\" you'll just create further strife.\n\n> when he's there taking photos with his ex wife and kids\n\nThe kids have a right to holiday photographs with their parents.

They aren't taking pictures of just your hubby and his ex, they are taking picture of the kids with their parents! It's their event, they get to decide who goes, not you. You host if you don't want the kids' mom there, instead of being pouty at someone elses event.  \n\n\nHate to say it, but your hubby to be will always be a dad first and foremost. You don't seem like you handle it very well.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA.  You knew what you were marrying into.  Her past behavior is not your business.  She will always be the mother of his children.  If you can't handle it, end the marriage", "You need to let them take pictures with their parents together.  Trust me it can mess them up later in life if they don\u2019t.  I\u2019m about to marry a guy who has divorced parents.  It was not a clean divorce.  We moved in together and I tried to get him to put pictures of from childhood.  He refused to let me frame any pictures of his parents together.  They got divorced when he was in high school.  He\u2019s 34 now and thankfully in adulthood finally went to therapy about it.  \n\nLet those kids do whatever they want with both parents.", "YTA. You got with this man knowing what the situation was. I\u2019m not sure how long you have been together but in all that time you had plenty of opportunities to put your foot down. When he proposed to you, you said yes to spending your life with him, you accepted the relationship you already had with him and confirmed by saying yes that you wanted to continue with the same situation. It is way too late now. He proposed to you with the intention of you joining his family. I know he said that he is happy to say something about it but I see it as completely unnecessary. You just seem incredibly insecure as she seems to not be doing anything to effect your relationship. You already got the man. Just ask to be included in the things that are making you feel uncomfortable and disrespected. If they say no, that\u2019s when you can say something. Right now, she isn\u2019t doing anything to harm anyone. She deserves to be apart of these life events with her children. Especially, if she is there with good intentions.", "YTA", "YTA!!

See a therapist PLEASE.", "YTA. Who his family invites, or doesn't, to events they plan or host is honestly none of your business. For the most part it's none of his either. You're both guests at an event, and if you want to control the guest list, host it yourself. \n\nIt sounds like the kids get pictures at these events with *their parents* and not this being a case of your fianc\u00e9e running off for couples pics with his ex. As far as those kids are concerned, you're not even in the picture. That's the correct way for them to act. You're \"dads wife\" and you should really get accustomed to that since it's your choice.", "That is so beautiful.", "My parents and step parents all got along great.  We did holidays and birthdays all together.  My ex sister in law still comes to dinners at my brothers.  His wife don\u2019t care kids are happy and that\u2019s all that matters.  My dad was at my step dads, maternal grandparents and my mom\u2019s visitation and funerals.", "Seriously! God imagine OP at her step-kids wedding, the fit she\u2019ll throw about not being included in a family picture of the kid wants a picture with the mom, dad, and partner alone\u2026 \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If they\u2019re co-parenting contact is inevitable.\n\n  \nAnd she still maintains relationships with members of his family as she\u2019s invited to family events.", "But the kids don't *ask* for their mother to be invited to events she's already invited to!\n\nHuge mystery why that is!", "Also, this just sounds like healthy coparenting. The kind of coparenting a lot of kids would kill for. I personally think more separated parents should strive to have a good enough relationship that their kids aren't forced to have a broken family with split holidays.", "She can absolutely put her foot down, this is an abhorrent way to treat a new family member and guess what: the ex stopped being a member of his family 3 years ago. The kids can have pics taken with their parents at their events (sports, birthdays, etc).", "They should absolutely drop her for cheating on their son and breaking up their family. Also, yes, divorce means you\u2019re no longer family. Pretending otherwise causes confusion and potential mental health problems. Not to mention the fact that no one wants to marry into a family just to realize they\u2019re never going to allow you to take up any space and will treat you like a second class citizen. Your attitude is why people don\u2019t want to date single parents.", "We have discussed it at length before, he wants everybody to be friends. I have no problem whatsoever being cordial and polite when the kids are present, and I have done a good job of it, the kids love me and give me hugs when they see me and cuddle with me when we watch movies. My opinion of his ex does not affect them in any way.\n\nI do not like her as a person, I've witnessed her yelling at him with a kid in her arms about being drunk at drop off time, when I know he hadn't been drinking. I live with the guy. \n\nNow she's trying to take his kids from him. She is not a nice person by any means and I've fostered an environment with the kids that they can talk to me about any thing and I won't get mad and yell at them. They feel safe and comfortable when they're under our roof, so the impact of my opinion of their mother does not affect them at all.\n\nMy fiance has finally realized that his ex has bad intentions and stopped pressuring me to be friends with her. He's finally seeing her for what she is.\n\nI will never forgive her for using his children as weapons. She's literally trying to take them from him right now. He's being investigated by the court because she said he's dangerous. No, I do not want to be friends with that woman.\n\nShe's not my family and she never will be. She left him for another man, she made a choice to sever those ties. They're my step kids, the kids are my family, my fiance is my family. She is not.", "Totally fine being an asshole and staying home when she's invited to events. \n\nI only go if the kids want me to. If they don't ask, I'll be an asshole at home alone lol", "I guess power can't be abused until you have it.", "But also a lot of the people in these comments sections are teens/young adults who haven't developed any emotional maturity, and/or are in divorced family situations where they hate their bio or step parents to the point that animosity is seen as normal and proper.", "Honestly, it was very much three adults just showing each other grace. All of them had a reason to not but they all made a choice to be good people and made the other people around set the standard as well but that\u2019s just how my family was. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t always work for everyone and I don\u2019t believe in forcing it if it doesn\u2019t work of course but trying is better than not. \n\nI am hoping as you go through your cancer journey you feel supported and come out on the other side.", "But if that is how two exes have agreed or want to co-parent with their kids, that is their right to choose that. Is that typical or the norm, no not really. But parents choose what is best for their children even if it puts a little strain on themselves. It's very important that children see their parents being able to have a positive relationship with one another. Does it suck for potential new partners, possibly, especially if they are insecure. But the new partner needs to accept or move on, because these parents have made this decision before the new partner came into the picture. Either the new person can handle it or not. If they can then great, if not, then they need to find someone else where they won't have this situation to deal with.", "Plus, they might never ask OP. She has no idea what conversations they have with other adults.", "They could half the day. Some people celebrate on a different day so everyone can be together. I always did this with my ex husband because I don't want to be around him.", "Thank you for this information! NTA imo. She is the ex for a reason. Time for everyone to let go, parents in law included.", "You're just gonna look bitter and petty, is that what you want?", "Why can't you just tolerate her for an afternoon?? This is only about your ego, and absolutely nothing else. \n\nYou don't care about your fiance, his kids, or the future you could have with this man.", "If you\u2019re comfortable being the ah than do you\u2026.but I don\u2019t think that will do anything good for your relationship with your fianc\u00e9 or the kids", "You and her are going to be the same level to his family. I wouldn\u2019t continue this relationship if you can\u2019t handle that", "Yeah, if OP & her fiance decided to invite mom to events it\u2019d be very different. But it\u2019s not ok for the extended family to allow/encourage the ex.", "This is the problem with step parenting. I want my life to be about me \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, this kind of attitude is why people don\u2019t date single parents. Guess what happens when you prioritize your kids above all else? They move out and you\u2019re all alone! Enjoy 40 years of solitude and sadness.", "My dad and step dad walked me down the aisle. It was my dads idea", "I do agree that blended family dynamics often see stepparents having to make the most sacrifices, but if this timeline is correct, then there was a very short turnaround between the OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s divorce and their about-to-be marriage. Fianc\u00e9 and ex divorced only three years ago, and now he\u2019s getting married to someone else. Not even introducing a relationship, he\u2019s *getting married*. Idk how old the children are, but I think that would be jarring for any child of any age. Heck, they have three kids. I\u2019m willing to bet the former couple had been together for more years than they\u2019ve been divorced. I think maintaining a sense of normalcy for the kids while they deal with the proverbial whiplash might help them in the long run. \n\n\nI am from a blended family, and while I\u2019d never seen my biological parents together, the transition was rough for my siblings, and their parents hadn\u2019t been together in nearly 7 years by the time my mom and I joined the picture. An idea for you OP, would be to try and host events with your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family and the kids on lesser holidays if it\u2019s possible. Or perhaps focus on creating experiences for just you, your spouse, and the kids. This will be a lovely way to bond with them and show them you care. But you have to see this from the big picture perspective. At the end of the day in blended families, the children\u2019s well-being has to come first. The ugly green monster can sometimes be uncontrollable, so perhaps confiding in your husband with the help of a therapist can help!", "Awkward for who? Not for the kids. Not for the grandparents. Not for the ex husband. Only for the immature jealous child he\u2019s marrying. Of all things to do together when you\u2019re divorced holidays with both parents and the new spouses is so important. It sets the tone and lets the kids know everyone gets along. We will always be a family. Moms welcome here. We all love each other. Dad shouldn\u2019t be marrying a woman who resents his children \u2026 that\u2019s what comes next. She isn\u2019t denying his ex wife when she disinvites her she\u2019s denying the children.", "Yes this decision is made by the parents - the parents of the soon to be husband :)\n\nOP said that that the fiance is supporting her regarding this. Which means he doesn't care if the ex is in the picture or not... Which means they have not talked about it or agreed on it together - as a way to be parents. She is just invited by the in-laws, who host family events. \n\nAnd i find that its out of line. Of course they can be friendly and get along with the ex - its their house. But inviting her over whilst the new couple is there,  is disrespectful and disruptive to them.\n\nI dont know if it is the case here, but a bit elderly people can be very insensitive in those matters (they probably dont think about it), and even talk about \"The good old times and experiences that the exes had together\" - and no new partner wants to listen to that :')", "How do you know what the kids are asking their grandparents for? They might not be asking OP but OP is not the most important person in their lives. Hell, she would be lucky to be top 10.", "I read that post, and I agree. I could get how it's hurtful but *it's not about the grownup, it's about the kids*. That's what it comes down to. OP don't marry this man if you're not prepared to be a STEP parent. You're not a replacement, you're an addition. YTA.", "This! You knew he was a great coparent when you started dating him and when you became engaged to him. You have zero right to demand that he stops this just because you\u2019re becoming his wife.  \n\nMy parents divorced before it was socially acceptable in early 70\u2019s. GREATEST GIFT ALL FOUR of my parents gave to my brother and I, and my stepsisters is that they all got along. We shared and share holidays and birthdays and graduations and family events, etc altogether for over 40 years now!!! my stepmother, passed two years ago, and my mother still includes my stepsister, her daughter in all events. \n\nWhen you marry someone with children, the children come first! You either have to accept to be second to the children\u2019s best interests or make the choice to walk away now before you get married.", "While I agree it\u2019s time to let go, that\u2019s not going to happen right now (it takes people time to reach that realization for themselves), and OP pressuring them is not going to make it happen any faster. It will just make them resentful and stressed about it. I say put up with her when necessary and support the family when they come to this realization on their own.", "It\u2019s not bitter and petty to have self-respect!", "I mean, I wouldn\u2019t want to be around a fianc\u00e9\u2019s cheating ex either.", "Maybe they care more about their grandkids spending holidays with both parents than remaining spiteful over why they broke up.", "That doesn\u2019t mean she shows up to all of his family\u2019s events.

It\u2019s inappropriate to not have boundaries after a divorce. It\u2019s messy and dangerous emotionally (and sometimes physically).", "It would be, but that poster is pulling that out of their ass. It doesn\u2019t look like that.", "Kids should absolutely be prioritized above New Romantic partners. If people don\u2019t want to sign on for that, fine. But it\u2019s bad parenting to do anything else. If that means parents have to wait to date until their kids are out of the house because they can\u2019t handle someone willing to take in blended family challenges, so be it.", "Things do change after a break up. In this specific situation. Things have changed to a new normal that works for everyone except OP.", "Op stated the kids dont even ask for her and I\u2019m rolling my eyes.", "Oh this is exactly what it is. She\u2019s threatened. His ex left him, moved on, and his family still considers her family enough to include in these events. It\u2019s a petty move and OP is insecure. My ex and I weren\u2019t married, have no kids, and I\u2019m still close with his parents because he\u2019s like a brother to me. And my ex wouldn\u2019t ever date anyone insecure enough to be threatened by that because he dates secure women.", "I said what I said.", "You can! This! My ex and I were together for 5 1/2 years, we broke up amicably when we realized we loved each other in a more brother/sister way but we still consider each other family. I\u2019m going on vacation with him and his brother later this year, we housesit for each other, my parents love him, his parents love me, and we\u2019re basically family.", "Fair. Regardless of the real details this whole situation sounds like a shit show lol.", "You are right. Everyone deals with loss in their own way and time. I just think it's fair of OP to expect/want it from them. Demanding or pressuring is another thing.", "Left for another man doesn\u2019t mean cheating\u2026(although it could) but also don\u2019t get engaged to a person with kids if you don\u2019t want to deal with their ex\u2019s", "My ex-husband opens presents Christmas morning at my house every year so neither of us have to miss out on Christmas morning with our son. I am also welcome at his Christmas breakfast, and if he didn't have dinner with his family he would also be welcome to that. We all trick or treat every halloween together with my brother his wife and kids, I set up Easter at my house and make sure his dad is here before he wakes up so he can see his son wake up to the wonder of Easter morning. We also routinely go to things together like petting zoos, movies, etc.\n\nMy boyfriend gives 0 fucks because he knows that my son will always be my priority, he has a new girlfriend and she'll be included eventually too. I never want to deny him the image of his parents getting along and both being capable of being there for him together just because his dad and I couldn't figure our shit out. My parents couldn't even be in the same room together after their divorce and that took a toll on everyone. \n\nI will go where my son goes, and if he wants to invite his dad along he will go too.", "Yeah that sounds extremely specific to you. Not particularly relevent in this case. Unless you're trying to imply shes in danger in this situation? Cause thats just ridiculous sorry to say."]}
