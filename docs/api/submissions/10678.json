Don't dismiss the experiences of people who understand but don't focus on the risks. You also seem to think OP's husband manipulated her into pregnancy by promising not to eat sushi? It's pretty sexist to assume she has no agency. Why are you infantalizing her and other women?", "It's okay to agree to disagree.\n\nIn this case it's a very-very specific single thing. One thing. And that thing (nigiri) is not even that common to order at outings.\n\nI have enough respect to honour my deals (in this case made first by husband by his own will) and enough respect to make my allergic friends feel heard, seen and included.\n\nEven if it is red wine - I can order beer, champagne, white wine, aperol, juice, sparkling water, cola or whatever.\n\nIf I know that there is one single thing my friend loves (as in literally the most favourite food) and can't have at the moment, I'd not dingle it in front of their nose and they won't even have to ask.", "I like your stance on this. People act like it's the end of the world and a stranglehold of their rights whenever these issues come up. It's so easy to be kind to people you love sometimes.", "NTA\n\nMy partner tries not to eat apples in front of me.\n\nNot because I asked him to, but because I developed allergies to apples later in life and I miss eating them.\n\nHe buys apple regularly and I think I've seen him eat an apple twice in the 19 years we've been together.\n\nKindness and thoughtfulness goes a long way.", "I feel like a lot of commenters are only saying NTA because you had an agreement (that he initiated).\n\nI honestly don't think that matters at all. If you're pregnant with your partners child, the least your partner can do is support you.\n\nDon't eat your pregnant partners favourite food in front of them if they can't have it due to pregnancy. Same goes with alkohol. If your pregnant partner loves wine, maybe don't drink wine in front of her while she's pregnant (unless she says she's okay with it). Just be a considerate partner ffs!", "NTA. You aren't stopping him from eating sushi, you're just stopping him from eating it in front of you. If he can't even do that for his pregnant wife, he might aswell not be a dad.", "Pregnancy is a team effort, it\u2019s not just on the mother to stay safe and healthy but on the father to help make the suddenly restricrive lifestyle more bearable. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s not allowed to eat sushi at all, all you\u2019ve asked is that he doesn\u2019t do it in front of you. Both my partner and I absolutely LOVE sushi and both if us would be heartbroken to miss out on it. But if you have to do it for nine months, he can suck it up for a single night. NTA", "You guys eat raw fish from a buffet in a restaurant that also serves tacos, pizzza, mexican and asian food? \n\nAt least where i live this would be pretty suicidal, lol.", "NTA. I want to call you TA because this is ridiculous, but he agreed and went back on it. That sucks.", "NTA.  I don't think he intended to be cruel but that was pretty thoughtless of him.\n\nIf it helps, buffet sushi tends to be nasty anyway.", "ESH.  You know there is Sushi without raw fish, that  you can eat?", "NTA, but you know most sushi is fine to eat during pregnancy? Only raw fish that has not previously been frozen is not recommended, which is actually rare in most sushi as most countries health and safety laws make it illegal, at least it is in UK, so in the UK a pregnant woman could eat sushi with no issue. Fish that is raw or smoked but previously frozen is fine, and you can even get it with cooked fish if you're still worried, which is also fine. The reason is raw fish could contain parasites which may be harmful, but they are killed off during freezing, so providing good hygeine practices are followed sushi is fine for pregnancy.", "NAH\n\nYou made a mistake in letting him make this kind of agreement in the first place.\n\nI know that sushi is your favourite food and you're having a hard time, but you shouldn't reasonably expect anyone to change their eating habits to make you feel better, *even if they insist that they want to.* Don't let people make promises to you that they will regret.\n\nYou should never have normalised this expectation, because now you have been hurt by him breaking it when it should never have been a big deal in the first place.", "YTA, because I'm sure it was a case of \"I told him not to ...\" than \"We agreed that he wouldn't ...\"", "You are also 7 months pregnant. Every hormone in your body is telling you he needs to signal that you're in this together. It's not like you can just change your mind and decide you're not going to be carrying his baby while you're at a buffet. So of course you'll be upset that he's backing out of an agreement over something like sushi. \n\nI wasn't a fan of the \"but I want sushi\" comment either. In about two months, his decisions are really going to have to take into consideration the whole family and some of your needs and those of your child will need to trump his wants.", "She is not an A for following advice that she was probably given by a medical professional - even if you or I don't agree with it.", "She wants her partner to keep a promise. That seems like a logical, adult expectation of a partner you are about to have a baby with.", "Out of curiosity, why does the fact that he initiated the agreement matter? \n\nHe can have sushi any time he's not with her. So why would it be so terrible of her to ask him not to eat food that she loves, but can't have in front of her?\n\nIf she were demanding that stangers or even friends stop eating sushi or drinking alkohol in front of her, that would be one thing... but this is her partner... she's carrying HIS child... I don't think asking him to not eat sushi infront of her is asking alot, condisering everything she is going through so that the BOTH of them can have a child.", "I want to upwote this more than once! Completely agree!", "I would still never have agreed to such a thing. I think he had good intentions, and he should have stuck to the agreement. However, it's a weird thing to get bent out of shape over. Let the man eat sushi. Pregnancy doesn't last forever.", "It's a petty argument to have before having a kid...", "Although he did help himself. To lots of tasty sushi.", "Because it means  she didn't force him to agree to not eating sushi in front of her since it was his idea.  She would  be nta  even without this, as she just has a hard time  staying away  from her favorite food for the sake of their child  and it's  hard even  without  being pregnant  skipping stuff you love to eat.", "I'm with you that sushi seems silly to me. But I'd be seriously concerned about keeping a human alive with a person who breaks an agreement over buffet sushi. \n\nBut maybe I am reading too much into this. Maybe it is all about the sushi.", "I agree. I don't think it's relevant at all. A normal supportive partner would do this without being asked!", "I suspect this man had no other choice but to agree to it.", "You sound like a real treat. Good luck with your relationship.", "For me it's the attitude that anyone needs to deny themselves anything to humor a pregnant woman. Whether he started it or not, she's coming across as petulant.", "Disagree. I never had cravings and it never bothered me when people ate/drank things around me that I couldn't consume. But my partner needed to do all the grocery shopping and if he ate ketchup he needed to stay at least 2m away from me or I would vomit, yet again. \n\nI had an easy pregnancy. Sounds like you did too. But everyone's pregnancy is different. What some people's bodies go through is absolutely insane. Partners often have to make changes to their lives even if they aren't carrying the child.\n\nWith cases like this it seems like it's about the person wanting to know that their partner is willing to make small sacrifices to show that they're in this together. That seems reasonable. \n\nIf my partner chose to eat one of the foods that made me nauseous right in front of me, I would have been upset. And not because I got nauseous. It seems like that's what she's feeling to a slightly lesser degree.", "Tamago is so good. I always get that as my \u201cdessert\u201d sushi. There are also tons of vegetarian roll options. My favorites are avocado/peanut, asparagus & asparagus roll.\n\nEdited- auto corrected from tamago to tamagotchi", "It doesn't make her nauseous, she's upset because she's not allowed to have it and thinks he shouldn't either. Petulant.", "Like I said, I wouldn't have been upset about the nausea as much as the fact that my body is falling apart in 20 different ways for OUR child, and he can't make this small adjustment to his day.", "Why should he? It's so petty that she's being a dog in the manger. I can't have it so he can't either...grow up."]}
