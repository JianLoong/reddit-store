OP's husband also initiated the agreement, whether or not we agree with that kind of deal, he tried to go back on his word and that makes him the AH in this situation.", "It's specifically raw sushi I was talking about, nigiri.", "She didn't say he couldn't have it all, though. Just not in front of her.", "Yeah OPs husband suggested the arrangement so she didn't make any rule.", "Honestly I\u2019m in the same boat of I loveeeee sushi. My doctor said so as you don\u2019t eat it a huge amount and stay away from the raw stuff it should be ok. They\u2019re is multiple options of sushi to make/eat/try to still enjoy it", "I get it. She's not asking him to move Mars because she's pregnant. He suggested he don't eat it in front of her. It's really not hard to eat something in front of someone if they don't want to see it or watch you eat it. \"Oh no, the person in front of me can't eat lactose and doesn't want to watch me enjoy a treat they can't eat. I'll just eat it when I'm not around them.\" It's so fucking simple. Honestly it's a weird hill for the husband to die on. It's his fuckin fault that agreement exists in the first place lol.", ">You\u2019re pregnant. All rationale goes out the window.\n\nThat's one way to infantilize pregnant women.", ">You\u2019re pregnant. All rationale goes out the window\n\nYikes... looking at it this way, I think I have to flip to her being TA.   Pregnancy is no excuse for unreasonable behavior. A person is not suddenly entitled to behave in an objectionable manner, because they chose to have a kid.", "She didn't ask him to give it up, just not to eat it in front of her.", "But he agreed to it.", "He doesn't have to give up anything, just not eat it in front of her. She is carrying HIS baby (well, both of theirs, but you get the point) that they mutually agreed to have. Pregnancy restrictions are hard enough, least your spouse can do is not make it harder by eating it in front of you, knowing you can't have it. It's not a situation of \"I'm suffering so you have to suffer too\", it's \"I'm suffering please don't make it any worse than it has to be\". He can eat sushi any other time", "Lol what kind of comparison is that? He AGREED to this, he can still eat sushi just not in front of her how is that AH behavior upholding him to what he agreed to", "This is like the only thing we agreed on, him not eating it in front of me. I don't care what else he eats. He could eat a medium rare steak and drink all the beer in the world if he wanted to.", "Then he shouldn't have agreed to it.", "He offered.", "Not eat sushi IN FRONT OF HER =/= can\u2019t eat sushi. Nta", "Asked for info and OP has let me know that he initiated the agreement. So he's definitely the asshole here -coming from a guy who would normally favor the male in a situation like this", "He initiated the agreement. She didn\u2019t tell him anything.", "The stupid part is it's ok to have pregnant if it's cooked fish", "She didn\u2019t ask him! Read OP\u2019s comments. He initiated the agreement", "Op is talking about raw sushi if you look at the comments.", "Are you aware of what sushi normally consists of?", "The husband suggested it.", "He\u2019s the one who came up with the agreement", "Read her comments, I asked for info about it and turns out he's the one who initiated the agreement. Kind of a dick move", "Because the raw stuff is delicious. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEdit: I just realized I think your \u201cwhy\u201d was directed at why she hasn\u2019t responded to other comments, not why she likes the raw stuff. That I can only guess is because she has been following her doctor\u2019s advice not random commenters on Reddit who are frankly all over the map on what they think is allowed. But for her sake I hope ppl are right and the doctor is out of date and she can have some nigiri before this is all said and done.", "Thanks. Thought that was very relevant information before my judgement :)", "But also what she loves is the nigiri, which is raw. This is like telling someone they can have a lentil loaf instead of a hamburger. That might be delicious but it\u2019s not her favorite food.", "Yeah and we know that, but is it fair to say she should trust some strangers over the internet with that information? She ought to do her own research if she wants to, but there are people here calling her all sorts of names that she really doesn't deserve to be called for just trying to be safe. It's really not hard to be nice about it and not belittle someone for not knowing something.", "My understanding is no big fish! Little fish contain less mercury and cook it\u2019", "Well she could eat \u201cfake\u201d dangerous sushi if she\u2019s creative lol. I would do that", "Thank you for the clarification.

I forgot about that, kinda new here. Thank you for pointing it out, going to change it!", "You're willing to raise a child with someone you would leave over a sushi roll?", "If you can break up over sushi, just break up now and spare your hypothetical child the inevitable drama that will be their life.", "Ya, I don't want to be the one to tell you this as you've been suffering for so long without Sushi, but you can eat Sushi while pregnant even if it's raw but you need to make sure it's from an actual decent Sushi restaurant and not a discount place.\n\nThat said, as someone who also really loves sushi, a lot of sushi is also cooked. Just grab a cooked one. I've been to those combo Asian restaurants and they always have a Philly Role or California role. Hell, they have more cooked sushi options at those places then uncooked. \n\nI disliked a lot about my OB when I was pregnant but one thing I did like was that she okay me to eat certain foods and have caffeine in small moderation. \n\nThat said YTA. I just can't get behind controlling what another person eats just because you can't have any. Get over it.", "Did they also say your husband can\u2019t have it? Or is that you being immature and controlling?", "And you could have had another kind. \n\nMany OBGYNs will even tell you that you can eat nigiri if the fish was previously frozen prior to consumption. \n\nRestricting someone else because you want one specific thing and refuse the alternatives that are available to you is just too much.\n\nEdited spelling.", "Raw sushi is now considered safe to consume in moderation for pregnant women as long as it is made from sushi grade fish, which is required to be frozen for a length of time and temperature to kill parasites. Mercury is a concern but the USDA says that that as long as you don\u2019t exceed 12 oz per week it is not a risk. 12 oz is a lot of sushi so if you just had a roll a week you\u2019d be totally fine. Your doctor\u2019s advice is outdated and wrong. Eat your sushi and rejoice! Just make sure it\u2019s the good stuff.", "You can still eat raw sushi. It\u2019s an FDA rule that all fish in the United States that is to be served as raw sushi needs to be flash frozen to kill parasites. I wouldn\u2019t trust a buffet though since you don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been sitting but freshly prepared is generally considered fine", "Just make your own then. You can eat it if you know it's been prepared properly. I just don't understand why you feel like you can't eat it", "fyi if you didn't know octopus and shrimp nigiri are cooked! I think red clam is cooked too but not 100% on that. And there's also the egg, tamago.", "yeah, but if he moved away from her in the buffet so he wasn't in front of her, would she be mad? or would she be upset she wasn't with him? /gen", "ohh, mb, NTA!", "I know, I can't stand when people break out those phrases. Pregnancy is not some excuse to be an entitled brat.", "Right? People need to stop pretending pregnant women are helpless or without self control.", "Relax, I\u2019m not being totally serious. But pregnancy hormones are wild.", "The husband not only agreed with it but he also initiated it. It\u2019s not behaving in an objectionable manner to expect him to follow through with an agreement he brought up first and was his idea", "YESSSS", "He also initiated this agreement. -Read ops comment histroy", "And she shouldn't have asked him to.", "Then it really doesn\u2019t change anything, he would be doing no wrong to change his mind.", "How is a promise a sweet gesture if you don\u2019t keep it?", "I\u2019m willing to leave someone for lying to me and going back on their word of course? If you can\u2019t handle such small sacrifices to support your partner after you AGREED to that, you can\u2019t really handle what a relationship and post partum brings. Those are very small first steps of showing genuine empathy to the medically at risk person. That is priority and a huge huge HUGE marker of who they are as a person\n\nIf someone didn\u2019t agree to that then that\u2019s a different story? I\u2019m not gonna demand someone do something out of the blue but\u2026agreements are important ESPECIALLY in pregnancy one of the most dangerous times of a woman\u2019s life", "It would be a breakup for being untrustworthy and not true to their word.\n\nIf their willing to break their agreement when I\u2019m still in danger of dying from a condition, why on earth would I ever trust them again!!", "Her husband CAN have it, just not in eat it in front of her, why are so many people not grasping that. That's not that difficult of an ask, especially when it was HIS idea.", "OP has said her husband initiated in a reply to a comment i made. \n\nI wouldn't call her expecting him to abide by an agreement that he insisted upon, immature and controlling.", "He agreed to it, can you not read?", "What? How is it immature to want the person who impregnated you, giving you a condition  you could DIE from to just not make that worse after he already agreed?\n\nMy partner knows it\u2019s the same thing. He can\u2019t do anything I can\u2019t do or I won\u2019t be getting pregnant he is not owed my body, possible death, and 9 months of misery if he isn\u2019t even going to take part in that sacrifice and make my time easier by FOMO. it\u2019s literally asanine he made an agreement and now is going back on it, if she died in birth was it really worth the struggle she had not being able to have food she likes and watching her partner have it all while she suffers just\u2026.alone? \n\nGood partners agree to the shared sacrifices and stick to them. No good partner goes back on their word to a pregnant woman.", "Legally in the US all sushi grade fish or fish intended to be consumed raw is required to to be frozen for long enough to kill any parasites. Mercury is more of a concern but it should be fine to have a little now and then.", "It would be kind of weird for your partner to go...eat somewhere else in the restaurant, don't ya think? Like, if I'm out to eat with my hubby and he disappears for 10-20 minutes, I'm gonna want to know why. Feels kind of rude.\n\n\n\n\nI also feel like it's not a giant ask on OP's part. She can't eat her favorite food for a set amount of time, asking the person who loves her and got her pregnant to not chow down on her favorite food in front of her for a few months seems within reason. Especially since he can go eat it when he's not with her.", "LoL I'm actually with OP on this. My comment here is about the previous comment, because the reasoning is crazy to me.", "She didn't ask for him to abstain, just not to do it in front of her.", "I never asked my partner not to eat sushi or rare steak during my current pregnancy, he offered. They agreed, he had the oppurtunity to say no or that he didn't think it was fair or to talk about exceptions. All she asked was not to do it in front of her and he did it anyways. He broke an agreement they made together he's managed to abide by for the last 7 months, what was 2 more?\n\nEdit to add; husband initiated the agreement too! So she didn't even ask!", "\"im gonna get sushi\" \n\n\"we agreed that you cant eat it in front of me!\" \n\n\"my bad\" *moves*\n\n\"what the fuck \ud83d\ude41\"", "I feel like \"What the fuck\" is the appropriate response. It's just like...don't get sushi while you're out having lunch/dinner with your wife. She asked, he agreed."]}
