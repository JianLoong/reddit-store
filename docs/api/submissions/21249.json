I don\u2019t think it would bother my parents too much, but I think it\u2019s a weird dynamic to bring along a child that isn\u2019t mine to family activities I.e. boating, fireworks, fairs\u2026just because her and her husbands families aren\u2019t super involved with any of the grandkids. I only ever wanted 1 child so that I could do all of those things 1 on 1 and only have the responsibility on 1 kid.

Your sons mother is trying to pawn the kid off on you.", "NTA. Your ex is wrong, it is not selfish of you. As a matter of fact, she should be grateful that you even include her daughter at all. You have no legal or financial responsibility for her child. You are not related to her in any way, shape or form. Your son is related to her. And while your parents may not mind you bringing this child along it could become a sticky situation when your son receives gifts, your exes daughter may feel left out. Even if they just get her a little something, there will come a time when she realizes the disparity and questions why her \u201cgrandparents\u201d don\u2019t love her as much as her half brother. It\u2019s just one can of worms after the other.", "NTA\n\nThis is a situation in which you get to do what you want, and neither option is wrong.  Should you want to bring your son's half-sister along, swell.  But the fact is, you don't want to.  This child is not related to you or to your parents.  She is part of your son's family, but not part of yours, and you are under no obligation to include her.\n\nThe fact that you very generously baby-sit this child doesn't give your ex license to have the audacity to *demand* that you include her daughter in your extended family, and to call you names if your don't.  Presumptuous, any?\n\nShe gets to ask; you get to say no.  When she became hostile, she was the A.\n\nYou're NTA", "Nta. Her 2nd kid is not your kid. Repeat that. \n\nShe wants you to act like a father", "NTA:  Would it be nice if you included her, yes it will. But you aren't obligated to include her daughter in family events. Yes your son is her family, but that doesn't make your family her family.", "Complicated situation. I would discuss with both your son and your parents. While you may not have an issue with including the half sister, your parents may not want to be forced into a relationship with a child who is not connected to them in that way.  And it sets up scenarios for disappointment - are you parents expected to provide gifts and other things for this not grandchild but still family of their grandchild?  Will they be allowed to do things only for your child? Before anything happens, they need to be on board with this.  You may believe they\u2019d be ok with this, but you can\u2019t know for sure until you ask. \n\nThen you need to decide if you want the responsibility and liability of a child who is not yours at these outings. Boating, fairs, etc. carry risks. Are you ok with that?  It\u2019s perfectly acceptable if you\u2019re not, but you need to take steps to protect yourself in the event something happens. \n\nOnly if you and your parents are on board, then you talk with your son, making it clear that he is allowed to choose if he wants to include his sister and how often that happens.  They are, after all, his grandparents. \n\nIf they all want to do this, you need to set boundaries on this. Who pays when doing activities that charge admission. Who pays for extras at these outings.  That sort of thing.", "Nta, you're doing more with the kid than most parents of a child with siblings from a different marriage would do.  You're not their parent at all.  You have no obligation to do anything and shouldn't be guilted into things like that.  Now that being said, you can if you want.  It should be 100% your choice.  I think she needs to realize you're already doing more than most in this situation would do by just babysitting and taking her to lunch or ice cream, etc.  I'm not saying you shouldn't. You could if you want, idk, but you shouldn't be guilted and manipulated into it.  Her parents and his parents ignoring the grandchildren doesn't mean you need to step up and fill in.  I don't even understand their rationale here.  They should 100% step up and fill that void, but in no way should they push that to you.  Your son should be careful not to rub it in the other child's face for sure, though.  I guess that means he shouldn't really talk about the fun things you guys do around the other child or show too many pics or talk about being excited around the child then.  I don't think he should be made to feel guilty either. Just some kids have different experiences, and it's a fact of life.  If your parents don't care and you don't care, then by all means take her, but it sounds like you do so don't.", "NTA. That being said, maybe bring her once or twice and see how it all works out. I see why your ex would like daughter to get grandparent time als, but younare in no way obligated to make that happen. . Congratulations on keeping such a positive co parenting relationship.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is tough.  On one hand I understand the awkward-ness of bringing another kid along.  On the other I also understand how the other child may begin to feel left out (I know its not your kid) but your son will tell the other child about all this amazing stuff they never see/do.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would recommend you view it more as a friend than your child.  What if in the future your son wants to bring a friend to the lake, or a friend to watch fireworks?  Will your answer always and forever be no, since it has to be 1:1.  For both your son, and your lives, I think occasionally having another join on trips would enrich you both.  That child is going to be in and around your life for the foreseeable future, might as well make the most of it and make their lives better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't see a problem with her asking, but playing the guilt/selfish game is too far.\n\nI'm in a similar situation, my ex and I share and 8 year old, and she has a 4 year old. When it comes to things for 8 if she wants 4 there we make it happen. There are even times I will take 4, like we've done trips just me 8 and 4 for birthday or just because. I know that if the roles were reversed ex would not treat my kid the same as I treat hers. But I also know it's not about me it's about 4, who's father isn't involved and has no intentions of being involved.", "nta. your son\u2019s sister is not your daughter. she\u2019s not your parent\u2019s granddaughter. she has her own family, and you are not her parent in any way. not a step, not an extra, just her brother\u2019s dad. if her mom has a problem, she should take it up with her dad. that\u2019s not you. \n\ntbh with the way your ex is talking to you, i\u2019d consider cutting back on babysitting her daughter. reset her expectations to align more with reality. your call, obviously, but you gotta remember you\u2019re not responsible for your ex\u2019s daughter just because you share a son. and she should, too.", "Yeah, no. she should be grateful you\u2019re doing those already. Is she out of her mind to be asking that. You are not her daughter dad. Idc how close you two are. If you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s your right.

I think the big thing is she made it seem like I should be bringing her with, not that like sometimes it would be nice. I think the best thing to do would be to talk to her about it, but I was feeling shitty about the situation and wanted to see if I was as bad a person as I felt yesterday.", "But not doing so isn\u2019t being asshole.\n\nHe has no obligation to the other child who already has a father and mother. \n\nThe mother chose a new man to have a kid with. Looks like she wants one man for Intimacy and another for resources. OP is being taken for a sucker.", "What would your son like to happen? This may help guide your decision. \n\nI think your ex is being ungrateful though. Maybe you should stop being a free babysitter and buying her daughter things for a while. She\u2019d become entitled and now is taking advantage of your kind nature.", "The comment that you're replying to should be ignored because it doesn't take into concern how you feel and your comfort. If it's something you're not currently comfortable doing then don't do it.

You are so great doing what you have so far. But the parents need to step in, do with her and explain the parent situation.  I have 2 different fathers for my kids also so I know it's confusing at first. But when the 2 leave We take our kid and do things. I explain they have a different dad they see but the same mom ect. My husband and I make sure our son knows and understands best he can for his age.", "NTA", "NTA. I totally understand why you would want to do those types of activities just with your son. Being outnumbered by little people who thrive on finding ways to maim themselves is terrifying vs. special experiences with your kid 1:1 is magical. You have no responsibility towards her daughter and shouldn\u2019t feel any guilt about setting boundaries. That said, it\u2019s absolutely lovely if you WANT to be another positive adult figure in her life, but that should be completely your choice.", "NTA it's great to co-parent but you don't need to integrate them into your extended family.", "It would be nice if you did. Big picture here. 30 years from now, all of these children will be adults - and remember the exclusion of their sibling.\n\nNTA. But, what would you lose by taking her along?", "NTA.  It's not your kid.  But you might want to take your son's feelings into consideration as well and bring her along from time to time.  It's clear he's got a good bond with his half sister and you don't want to be perceived (by him) as threatening that.  Plus you know your ex is going to eventually use it to try to poison your son against you because it just sounds like that's how she is.\n\nAgain, definitely NTA, but from time to time it might be nice to include her.  Also assuming your folks want her there.", "NTA.\n\nYounger isn't your responsibility AT ALL, & you're wonderfully generous to do what you're already doing.", "NTA.   This is not your child.  This is not your parents' grandchild.  Honestly it sounds as if they're getting way too used to you playing adjacent parent with the babysitting and such.  Time to start putting up boundaries.  And gotta laugh at the lame attempt at shaming with accusations of selfishness.  Hilarious.", "NTA. Not your kid. They're just looking for a babysitter. Let them pay for one.", "NTA. Your ex literally wants her and her partner\u2019s kids to have the benefit of your family. That isn\u2019t how things work. You already go out of your way for this kid, and to treat them and your son as equals. This would be a weird line to cross, and in fact she is being the selfish one - not you. It puts you in a very difficult position and you also have no legal authority over the child, god forbid something happened. Your ex is your ex - she isn\u2019t part of your extended family anymore. She is pretty entitled to even ask, and totally out of line to be upset about it. NTA not even in the least. Hold your ground.", "Nta", "NTA. Gave an inch, now she wants a damn mile.", "We also do things as a family when we are all together.", "No.", "But here's a thing, if you don't feel comfortable taking that child to your family events, then you shouldn't force yourself to do it. She's not your kid, she just happens to be related to your son. That does not automatically guarantee her access to your side of the family. Now if your parents or your family members were to invite her, then it might be different, and it might be easier for you to sacrifice your comfortability. But that's not the case. You've said no, and they are pushing. That's disrespectful.", "There is also a big difference between scenarios like OP inviting a friend (or the half-sister) along, OPs son asking to invite someone along (and OP agreeing) or even the grandparents encouraging OP to invite the half-sister along and the situation OP faces here with his ex pushing OP to take her daughter.\n\nThe first three all involve adults who are involved in the event issuing or approving of an invite. The last isn't even an invite. It's a demand. By someone who won't be there. A rather entitled one at that.\n\nVery much a false equivalence that that comment is trying to make.\n\nAnd OPs comfort level in taking along another kid (regardless of who) is definitely a reasonable factor. If he's not comfortable with the idea, that should be enough.\n\nOP is NTA.", "NTA, idk why psycho mothers think their kids deserve everything and anything. \nThis is a dad trying to spend time with his biological son while his ex tries to pawn her own kid off as well so she can get a break.", "NTA - By the time your son goes to university, she will be asking how much money have you saved up for her daughters tuition.", "NTA. She just wants alone time. Which I get. But that isn\u2019t your child. Say no and let her think what she thinks.", "You're NTA. If your son wants you to bring along his sister, and he asks you to, that would be different.

Not hers.", "What does S-tier mean?", "Info:  what is an S-tier grandparent?", "INFO: is your son asking to include his half sister? Including her the same way you would include one of his friends or classmates seems normal, but to include her as a surrogate grandchild may cause issues down the line.", "NTA, this is not your child.  It is not selfish.  You need to start to limit the time you spend with this child.  They are using you as a third parent.", "NTA - next thing you know, it'll be wrong to pay for only one child's college expenses, or do anything that doesn't involve your ex's kid.", "You say you only wanted one kid, but you sure do seem to be going above and beyond watching the kid she had AFTER you already split up. Not your kid, not your responsibility. I feel bad for her that she misses out if you don't take her, but that's not your fault.", "not your kid.. so no responsibility on you to involve her in anything..  you can choose freely to take her along but never bow down to pressure..", "NTA. You are not responsible for the other child. Anything you do for her is just out of the kindness of your heart and should not be a requirement.\n\nI was in a similar situation. After the split, I'd get presents for my son and his half sibling (shared mother). My family would also get gifts for the both of them. However, his half sibling would also get additional gifts from his father's side of the family but they never got any gifts for my son at all.\n\nMy son told me that he felt it was unfair. His sibling would get gifts from us and his father's family while my son only got gifts from us. To top it off, his sibling would brag about how everyone loves them more and that's why they got double the gifts for every occasion. Kids...", "Agreed.", "I think the only opinion, besides OP's, that matters here is his son's. If OP's son wanted his dad to include his half sister, then I think OP should consider it \u2013 but in that case, OP would need to try to make sure that his son *genuinely* wanted his half sister to tag along, and wasn't just saying so because his mom and step dad guilted him into it. But it's important for parents to try to spend one-on-one time with each of their kids, and OP should absolutely protect his solo time with his son.", "Haha like better than A in like a grading scale. I know I\u2019m bias because they\u2019re my parents, but they are such awesome grandparents to my son.
