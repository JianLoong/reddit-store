Your sons mother is trying to pawn the kid off on you.", "NTA. Your ex is wrong, it is not selfish of you. As a matter of fact, she should be grateful that you even include her daughter at all. You have no legal or financial responsibility for her child. You are not related to her in any way, shape or form. Your son is related to her. And while your parents may not mind you bringing this child along it could become a sticky situation when your son receives gifts, your exes daughter may feel left out. Even if they just get her a little something, there will come a time when she realizes the disparity and questions why her \u201cgrandparents\u201d don\u2019t love her as much as her half brother. It\u2019s just one can of worms after the other.", "NTA\n\nThis is a situation in which you get to do what you want, and neither option is wrong.  Should you want to bring your son's half-sister along, swell.  But the fact is, you don't want to.  This child is not related to you or to your parents.  She is part of your son's family, but not part of yours, and you are under no obligation to include her.\n\nThe fact that you very generously baby-sit this child doesn't give your ex license to have the audacity to *demand* that you include her daughter in your extended family, and to call you names if your don't.  Presumptuous, any?\n\nShe gets to ask; you get to say no.  When she became hostile, she was the A.\n\nYou're NTA", "Nta. Her 2nd kid is not your kid. Repeat that. \n\nShe wants you to act like a father", "NTA:  Would it be nice if you included her, yes it will. But you aren't obligated to include her daughter in family events. Yes your son is her family, but that doesn't make your family her family.", "Complicated situation. I would discuss with both your son and your parents. While you may not have an issue with including the half sister, your parents may not want to be forced into a relationship with a child who is not connected to them in that way.  And it sets up scenarios for disappointment - are you parents expected to provide gifts and other things for this not grandchild but still family of their grandchild?  Will they be allowed to do things only for your child? Before anything happens, they need to be on board with this.  You may believe they\u2019d be ok with this, but you can\u2019t know for sure until you ask. \n\nThen you need to decide if you want the responsibility and liability of a child who is not yours at these outings. Boating, fairs, etc. carry risks. Are you ok with that?  It\u2019s perfectly acceptable if you\u2019re not, but you need to take steps to protect yourself in the event something happens. \n\nOnly if you and your parents are on board, then you talk with your son, making it clear that he is allowed to choose if he wants to include his sister and how often that happens.  They are, after all, his grandparents. \n\nIf they all want to do this, you need to set boundaries on this. Who pays when doing activities that charge admission. Who pays for extras at these outings.  That sort of thing.", "Nta, you're doing more with the kid than most parents of a child with siblings from a different marriage would do.  You're not their parent at all.  You have no obligation to do anything and shouldn't be guilted into things like that.  Now that being said, you can if you want.  It should be 100% your choice.  I think she needs to realize you're already doing more than most in this situation would do by just babysitting and taking her to lunch or ice cream, etc.  I'm not saying you shouldn't. You could if you want, idk, but you shouldn't be guilted and manipulated into it.  Her parents and his parents ignoring the grandchildren doesn't mean you need to step up and fill in.  I don't even understand their rationale here.  They should 100% step up and fill that void, but in no way should they push that to you.  Your son should be careful not to rub it in the other child's face for sure, though.  I guess that means he shouldn't really talk about the fun things you guys do around the other child or show too many pics or talk about being excited around the child then.  I don't think he should be made to feel guilty either. Just some kids have different experiences, and it's a fact of life.  If your parents don't care and you don't care, then by all means take her, but it sounds like you do so don't.", "NTA. That being said, maybe bring her once or twice and see how it all works out. I see why your ex would like daughter to get grandparent time als, but younare in no way obligated to make that happen. . Congratulations on keeping such a positive co parenting relationship.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is tough.  On one hand I understand the awkward-ness of bringing another kid along.  On the other I also understand how the other child may begin to feel left out (I know its not your kid) but your son will tell the other child about all this amazing stuff they never see/do.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would recommend you view it more as a friend than your child.  What if in the future your son wants to bring a friend to the lake, or a friend to watch fireworks?  Will your answer always and forever be no, since it has to be 1:1.  For both your son, and your lives, I think occasionally having another join on trips would enrich you both.  That child is going to be in and around your life for the foreseeable future, might as well make the most of it and make their lives better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So when I took them, it was 4 kids and yes, I took them fairly often including to my parents' house (they had an in ground pool). Good kids and well behaved so it wasn't like they were a burden.\n\nI was also aware that ANY time our girls spent with their Dad, they had all 4 kids and she treated them very well. That and not having the stress that so many divorced parents have with custody issues was worth gold to me.\n\nYou need to communicate with your ex and her husband - preferably by e-mail - and tell them that while you don't mind babysitting on occasion to give them a break, there are activities you would like to do only with your son. Step sister is a lovely child but she's not your child and it isn't selfish of you to want to spend time only with your son. It is, however, inconsiderate of them to demand you treat their daughter as if she's yours, too.\n\nYou don't want to turn a good co-parenting relationship into a tit for tat and with this in mind, I'm also advising you to document EVERYTHING about this matter. If you have texts or e-mails, save them to a specific folder. When you babysit their daughter or include her in activities, log it. If she pulls the \"if you won't do this maybe it's time we review the custody agreement\" crap, all of your documentation is ammo in court. Get as much of this issue and discussions about it in writing as possible. Keep all correspondence from your end firm but polite. Re-read and re-write as many times as necessary before you hit the send button. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. It's one thing to babysit, but ex is taking your kindness for granted now. She's demanding too much and needs her expectations firmly adjusted. Stand your ground on this.", "S tier? Oh come ON. And you should ask your kid. It's about your kid, right?", "NTA. \n\nBut for the near future I would ease up on the free babysitting and let her know you feel like she doesn\u2019t appreciate the things you DO include her kid in (which are outings you are comfortable with) and you need to reevaluate the dynamic you all have established as you don\u2019t like the entitlement this situation has revealed to you.", "NTA. You\u2019re not this little girl\u2019s father, and your parents are not her grandparents.\nI do advise sitting her down and discussing this with her when she\u2019s old enough to understand, though", "You can bet that would be the next step. Once the ex gets a foot in the door for her daughter, she'll start demanding that she is treated \"equally\" (meaning that she gets gifts of the same monetary value, then later maybe college money etc.). OP is already doing more than he owes his ex. That's nice of him, and I'm sure it benefits his son emotionally to have his sister included in some activities with his dad. But both kids should learn that the share a mother and only one set of grandparents.", "Exactly what I thought! NTA", "Thanks for answering that. I also had no idea what S-tier meant.\n\nAnd returning the favor: It's \"biased,\" not \"bias.\"", "Its rare to see people ask or bring up how the the kids feels about including their half sibling or step siblings in these kinds of post. Most kids will see the child being raised along side them as their sibling and want to include them. Especially if they know their sibling is hurting over it.   \n\n\nThough OP NTA regardless, I just think more people should really be asking their kids opinion."]}
