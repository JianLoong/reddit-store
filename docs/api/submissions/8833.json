Legitimately, this is weird behavior.  And don't be friends with thieves, no one deserves that. Are you very well off for your area?

Maybe I\u2019m slightly prideful but not really hiding anything. For me it\u2019s more about security and theft. People know I have medical issues.

I\u2019ve been closing the bedroom door before I go answer the front door but as I mentioned, that doesn\u2019t always work.\nI will definitely be letting friends know that they need to tell me if someone new is coming over. To be fair, she thought I had met him before and mentioned she was with him earlier when she called me on the phone.I just didn\u2019t put it together that he would be coming with her. I thought they were dropping him off somewhere when they said they were giving him a ride. So for me it was an unexpected new person.

But you are not the asshole for keeping people out, so feel proud of that boundary. \"Nope, no one's allowed in my bedroom or private bathroom, sorry.\"  Anyone who pushes that boundary isn't a friend worth having.", "I thought of this but I live in an apartment with maintenance and they would have to change the door knob to give me a key.

All it takes is ~$20 and a screwdriver. Keep the original knob and put it back on when your lease is up.", "I would like to do that but it\u2019s not possible because if maintenance sees it, I could have a problem. They kick people out for any little thing in my building. Not worth the risk since it\u2019s such a small place and open design it\u2019s not easy to just walk in and wonder around. I\u2019m not more than ten feet away from the door at anytime so I can keep my eyes peeled and stop someone. I\u2019d rather have a conversation -even if it\u2019s not comfortable-when I stop someone rather than have people trying the door handle with no luck."]}
