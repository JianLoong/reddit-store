I thought they were dropping him off somewhere when they said they were giving him a ride. So for me it was an unexpected new person.

No ma'am, not in my own home you don't get to dismiss my feelings.", "NTA at all, I am the same and will always respect the host's private bathroom and bedroom.\nOne time I was over at my neighbour and both 'public' bathrooms were taken and he said \"oh just use our private bathroom\", I still declined though as I feel bad for going through their private areas", "NTA. This is just bizarre. It feels like your friends are nosy/jealous and looking to snoop, steal from you, or take advantage of any imagined luxuries they assume are in your master bathroom. No one is allowed in my master bath without express one-time-use permission, whether it be friends, family or roommates.\n\nThat's not like some paranoid position to take either! It's entirely normal to be a bit of a slob in your personal private spaces. Like I don't want random people seeing my underwear on the floor just because i forgot to toss my pjs in the hamper after my morning shower \ud83d\ude05", "There is a lot about this scenario that is very peculiar - the people demanding to use your ensuite is only a fraction of it. \n\nHow do they even know you have an ensuite? Why are you telling people you have a bathroom that you then don\u2019t want them to use? Why are you keeping a load of personal stuff (like make up brushes) in a guest bathroom? And again this question to the point that you\u2019re now locking the cabinet? Are you on any regular medication or do these visitors expect you to be?\n\nNone of it makes any sense to me.", "NTA thieves want access to the bedroom.", "Get a lock for your bedroom door.", "NTA.\n\n1) It's your residence - your rules.\n\n2) If you have to go in your bedroom to get to the personal bathroom, it's perfectly understandable that you wouldn't want people doing that.\n\n3) The last time someone went in there, valuable stuff was either stolen or moved around in such a way that you lost it. So you are rightly doubly cagey about having people in there.\n\n4) You have a perfectly decent guest bathroom.\n\nI'm sorry someone went through all your stuff!", "You are lucky you didn't lose your medications. If you had any Xanax or pain killers they would disappear magically", "NTA - nobody enters my bedroom without my permission. And the permission is always for one time only. I have private stuff in there and it is my safe space.\nAnd absolutely nobody is allowed to relax on my bed. I have a sofa in the living room for guests.", "NTA", "NTA. What kind of weirdo goes to somebody's home and asks to lie on their bed?? Asking to use the bathroom is reasonable, people do it all the time, but you use whatever bathroom your host points you to. Why the insistence on the primary bathroom?", "NTA\n\nIts your home - your rules. \n\nAlso you are not obligated to make allowances for a suspected thief.", "I have relatives who've lived in their house for idk, thirty odd years? more? Last time we visited they asked me and my SO to bring down a Christmas tree for them as it was too difficult to get it off the top of the wardrobe in one of the bedrooms. On the way upstairs, my SO asked me which bedroom it was. I had no idea! I'd never been upstairs in their house before (the toilet is downstairs). It is not conventional to go into someone's bedroom when you're visiting. NTA", "NTA, it\u2019s things like this that completely turn people off of having guests in their homes", "Nta it's weird for people to want to go in your bedroom", "NTA - But what kind of friends show up at your place... and ask if they can lay in your bedroom? Either I was raised like that or I don't know, but the primary bedroom shall not be entered expect by the owner.", "Nta. This is super weird\u2026 do you come across as someone who had money? Nice jewelry? Collectibles? No sane person would think it\u2019s fine to go into your bedroom or master bath. Maybe it\u2019s the kind of people you associate with. Maybe they are just all shitty people.", "NTA and get a lock for your bedroom.", "NTA. My house, my rules. But, if I really don't want someone to go into a specific room, I lock the door before guests arrive.", "Definitely! If you\u2019re at someone\u2019s house and don\u2019t feel well and want to lie down, you go *home* for heaven\u2019s sake! Not go to host\u2019s bedroom. \n\nThat\u2019s just plain weird and probably means they have another motive. You\u2019re good for keeping this very normal boundary.

Simple to install several use velcro.", "NTA\n\nOp kinda awenserd thier own question... \n\n\nThe \"friend\" wanted to do some personal shopping in the master bedroom because that's where the high value stuff would be kept...\n\nPersonally I would never allow that friend back in my home as they have stolen from me, and op. Is more than allowed to be upset. \nI know it's just stuff but it's your stuff that you worked hard for, and gifts are always special regardless of thier value...", "The only person that doesn't live with me that has ever laid in my bed was my best friend of my whole life (44 years) and I was having a pretty rough emotional break during my divorce and she laid down with me and held me as I cried while her husband loaded my kids up to go swimming. That is the absolute only reason anyone could get away with coming into my space (she didn't ask and basically broke into my house by bullying my kids into letting her in, but it was appreciated).", "Thank you for that. I wish I did kick her out at that point I wouldn\u2019t have been the victim of theft.", "Yeah a house is a personal space. A bedroom even more so. Your bed in your bedroom even more than that. I am not super like picky about it personally. But I would never just assume someone would be ok with me going into their room or into their bed without permission. And certainly wouldnt be miffed if they said no.", "I'm so sorry about your things. It is violating. I hope you had a talk with your friend about her brother. I would have been so embarrassed I think.", "Your comment just answered it for me. I was trying to figure out what was going on because it's just. so. odd. to be asking to go into someone's personal space like that, and according to OP it happens quite often. When she mentioned she's an older woman, I knew that had to be part of the puzzle and you've just filled in the rest: They're assuming that because she's older she'll have medications which they can steal in order to use or sell. Likely also that they can use her age against her if she does accuse them of stealing.", "Yeah, I assumed they were going to the bathroom to look for drugs to steal.", "I'm just shocked that someone would even ask.", "Yea it's def a .... wtf? feeling", "Sometimes  the valuables for which people look  in a master bedroom  or bath are pain medications that can be sold.", "Nta. It's very normal to not want guests in your master. Your 'friends' sounds sus.", "Nta. I didn't even read it.\n\nIt's your house your room you are entitled to your room and what's inside. If people don't respect that, you can always call the cops for being on your property.", "NTA. You need better friends. That's beyond bizarre to be so free in someone else's house.", "NTA\nWho are your friends? They lack decorum.?\nGet a locking doorknob for master bedroom.\n\nDo you wear nice jewelry that would make you a target?", "NTA but your ex friend and that brother are. Who the fuck asks if they can lay in your bed when they don't know you?", "OP ' *It seems like everyone that comes into my home (even for the first time) wants to go in my primary bedroom and/or primary bathroom. I can\u2019t understand it '*\n\nNeither can I.\n\n**NTA 100%**", "NTA. Thieves use social pressure to get away with things like that. You should call her out for the things that went missing during her visit. You're probably not the only one who has had stuff come up missing", "NTA. That woman and her brother are truly weird and the woman also a thief. Maybe her brother wanted to steal from you, too.", "NTA\n\nyour house, your rules. Plain and simple.\n\nIf you know they stole the stuff (if they were the only ones who went there for example before it went missing), I would definitely call them out.", "WTF? NTA  I cannot imagine inviting myself into another adult's bedroom. In the first case, your friend definitely just wanted to loot what she figured would be the more treasure filled bathroom.", "Come clean OP... what are you hiding in your bedroom?", "NTA.  Both visitors behaviour is disgraceful.  I don't know where you live but if someone stole from my bathroom items that are easily identifiable (from a set) I would report theft to police, explain why I believe it was X who stole them, and ask police to recover them.", "NTA \nYour house, your rules\nMaybe put a lockable door knob on your door?\nOne with a key to lock from the outside \nAnd a simple turn knob on the inside\nSo people can\u2019t sneak in", "NTA. You need to reevaluate your friend group.", "NTA and I think it's very weird that people feel entitled to go into your private bedroom and bathroom when there is another space and bathroom available for use!!", "NTA and seems like you got a lot of weirdos coming to your house", "NTA. Nobody needs to be anywhere in your home if you don't want them to. Nobody's allowed in my bedroom.", "How warm do you keep your home when guests are there ? \n\nCurious.", "NTA.  When a residence has a guest bathroom, you don't go into someone's private space unless invited.  It's really weird to get offended that someone doesn't want you in their bedroom or ensuite bathroom.", "NTA. How come so many entiteled people come to your home?", "NTA. Your hunch is right. They\u2019re looking to steal. Also who sleeps in a stranger\u2019s bed? People tend to store make up, lotions, and medications in bedroom or bathroom,", "NTA\nI remember when I was young my mother told us that whoever comes to visit make sure to lock the door either my bedroom door or her and Dad's bedroom door. Because it's not like she didn't trust them but you never know especially the kids never allowed him to come or else they might take stuff or do stuff that they won't like. So I understand where you're coming from and I feel like they're just entitled people and you should still keep up the privacy. Everyone is entitled to privacy", "Why are you so resistant. \nOk so you smoke a ton of weed is that why you don't  want maintenance to put a doorknob. ?\nYou ask if you'd be AH if you don't let people use master bathroom.  No you would not be.\nBut you don't want to take any preventative measures.\nI read your older than most of these people...\nWhat's your game?", "You said others were using the main bath. How do you know she was the thief?", "That\u2019s what seems to be happening. I think you hit the mail on the head", "I feel like I\u2019ve done the same. I would not feel comfortable going into people\u2019s bedrooms", "Yes. Exactly. I\u2019m not exactly hiding anything. It\u2019s just crazy to me to think that\u2019s ok", "I get asked \u201chow many bedrooms do you have?\u201d And so I\u2019ll never answer again that there is also a bathroom on that end of the apartment. \nThe main bathroom is extremely large with loads of space for storage. It\u2019s a small apartment so I make use of the space. \nI put the makeup brushes and lotion in there diluting Covid when nobody was coming to my home and did not think about later thrived might come along. I wasn\u2019t thinking that anyone would come in at that point never mind someone new and so it was a surprise to me to happen at all. It\u2019s not so much a guest bathroom. To me it\u2019s the other bathroom on the other side of the house but from now on, it\u2019s becoming the guest bathroom. \nThe cabinet is not the medicine cabinet. It\u2019s a storage cabinet where I used to store my tools. They have since been moved but I keep the cabinet locked. Let them try to break into an empty cabinet and waste time on that. Lol", "I\u2019m realizing this now.", "Thank you for that", "Yes that\u2019s what I assume they were looking for for so long in there", "Exactly my thoughts. I think I must be right about this one", "That\u2019s why I thought it was weird, too", "Yes. But nobody was suspicious until after the incidents or they would not be allowed in the door to begin with.", "Thanks for the confident response.", "She\u2019s not coming back. I broke ties to her", "That\u2019s what I think, too", "I did. She\u2019s not coming back and neither is the friend.", "I can\u2019t because it\u2019s against the lease unless I ask maintenance to do it and I don\u2019t want maintenance in my room, either. They have a way of only coming as soon as I try to leave the apartment so I don\u2019t like putting in requests because it\u2019s disturbing to me to think maintenance was there when I\u2019m not home.", "To be fair it happens when someone new comes along. My friends don\u2019t steal and our friend culture is to share openly. \nI don\u2019t have money. I don\u2019t come off like I have money. However my building is new and very nice so on the way up, they might think I have money.", "I don\u2019t want maintenance in because I don\u2019t like anyone in my bedroom. \n\nThe ton of weed comment was a joke.", "Good point. That\u2019s why I broke ties with both her and the friend that brought her to my place. Either way I was done with both of them.", "This is such a weird idea to me. The only time I've asked to lie down in someone else's bed was when I was going through formal sorority recruitment and (just like 80% of us) I got really sick and was so worn down, I asked my big if I could lie down on her bed because she lived in the house and I didn't. I can't imagine going to a sibling's friend's house and asking to have a nap in their own personal bed", " \nEven my kids ask before using when the other is occupied.", " You were polite and courteous and your guest did not show the same consideration for you.", "Good on you for trusting your instincts. We as women are constantly told to ignore them and it's a bad idea when we do. This wasn't an extreme situation, but The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker goes into why listening to them is important (just skip the chapter on domestic violence- it's no good).", "Adding: I am not on regular meds but it\u2019s reasonable that they think I might be as most people are on meds.", "Put a camera in your room and bathroom.", "Are you rich OP?\n\nOr do you own expensive belongings that they know about?", "Have you asked maintenance if it's okay for you to replace the bedroom knob? You could get one of those basic locks that can be unlocked with just a paperclip but enough to stop someone \"accidentally\" opening the door. Then they don't even need to worry about keeping a copy of the key themselves."]}
