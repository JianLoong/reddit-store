It's like people who tells Jewish people (I am Jewish) to \"get over\" the holocaust, or people who tell Black Americans to \"get over\" slavery, Jim Crow laws and decades of structural racism.

As such an invested fan it should not have been extra effort for him to take a few seconds to look into why those titles have caused controversy in/out of Japan. SNK's significantly more overt with its fascist messaging so even if he couldn't read between the lines of Demon Slayer, he should have been able to piece together that it's a gigantic no-no even for ppl who aren't Korean. Call me petty but would also like to add additional asshole factors for the fact that he's consumed enough by his interests in anime for BOTH of the taboo series to be his only answer to that question. I have non-Asian friends who are huge into anime and there's nothing wrong with anime influencing their personality so long as it doesn't become their entire life which, frankly, sounds like it is for him if he has no other interests to talk about on the spot.

Hey I've been there as a mixed gal + my Korean-Japanese maternal line and uber nationalistic paternal side--feelings get super intense and yes the xenophobia isn't great and can be ignorant as well. Saying you're placating your dad being racist is 1.) dumb bc your friends are boiling it down to racism which it's not--it's the direct result of Korea's state of nationalism after being colonized and 2.) you're not placating your father--you literally asked beforehand for your BF to talk about anything else and he didn't.\n\nHe took your consideration for your father WAY too personally and frankly needs to get out of his own head.

When the plot made its major political shift (? several years before it ended don't recall off the top of my head) I was the \"odd one out\" in my personal circle who thought the writing was uncomfortable.

It'll be an ongoing war (No pun intended) of him pointing it out every chance he gets so he can then laugh or cry poor and that he's being attacked, when someone finally get a sick of his shit.

His whole personality shouldn't be two animes. I think it's being sensitive and thoughtful to someone. \n\nFor example, my husband and I love musicals. A huge part of our interest and romance is musicals. He's polish. We enjoy the musical \"The Producers\" which is about two people trying to make a fortune by producing the worst musical ever and absconding with the funds. In order to ensure their musical is terrible, they produce a pro-hitler musical written by a devoted Nazi. Now, I don't think the point of the musical is to be pro-hitler, but even still, we don't talk about liking that musical in front of his older family just in case it would offend them. We're not even sure they would see it as a offensive, but his grandmother grew up directly affected by Nazi Germany and this in turn had an affect on how his parents were raised. Nobody gains anything by us admittedly talking about ONE musical we enjoy that brings up a sensitive history. We are not oppressed by being unable to mention it, and further more despite being a HUGE musical fan and nerd, we're also more than musicals. \n\nI get where you're coming from though because on the surface and not understanding the history it WOULD be controlling behavior for most scenarios, and sometimes  yes, we can expect the world to bend to our traumas instead of healing from them. I just think that this is one of those outliers when it's more considerate and appropriate to refrain from talking about something. I think the difference being this isn't just an isolated event but something that was devastating to a whole nation. We will probably agree to disagree."]}
