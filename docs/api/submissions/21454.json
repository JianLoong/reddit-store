We have some pretty strict rules here about having children on our unit, the minimum age being 12. \n\nThe daughter of the patient just hadn\u2019t been able to find a baby sitter and had begged our higher management to let her five year old daughter in with her. I really do feel for her. She said she had recently started on some anti-anxiety meds because of the stress of her mom being in the hospital. And she\u2019s juggling a high energy kiddo on top of that. \n\nHowever, while updating the mom on the patient, her daughter was running all over the room and opening multiple drawers. It\u2019s an ICU, we have heart carts for fresh post-ops so we have a lot of sharp objects. She ran to the bathroom, pulled them emergency cord. I asked the mom to perhaps hold her while we talk or if we could wait to update until her daughter is calmer because it genuinely seemed like a safety risk to me. She said her daughter would be fine and shortly after her daughter jumped directly on top of the patient in the bed. This patient had her ribs cracked open for surgery, had multiple chest tubes, and in the distress of having someone jump on top of her, she almost yanked out an IV out of her neck that was running several pressors keeping her BP up. \n\nI won\u2019t lie.
