Recently I got some money after my grandpa passed and was able to buy a duplex. I put down 20% and she and I have agreed to split the mortgage, property taxes, insurance, utilities etc. It comes out to $1000 for each and she agreed. But then she wanted to make changes to the house I don\u2019t agree with and bring her dog.\n\nHer dog has been living with her parents for the 3 months we moved into together (the place I rented before buying). She wants to bring him because he\u2019s her dog and her parents only agreed to let him stay with her temporarily. But I don\u2019t want a dog to move in with us and potentially damage the house. He isn\u2019t known to damage stuff as far as I know but he does run around the house and I want her to pay $100 extra a month for potential damage or $1000 extra as a damage deposit. She is angry because we agreed on $1000 and no damage deposit and feels like I\u2019m making it to hard to bring her dog.\n\nShe also wants to put a clothes line in my backyard and I find it weird and tacky. Maybe it\u2019s because I grew up in suburbia but everyone I know uses the dryer but she insists she needs to have a clothes line and hates the dryer. She claims her clothing to too expensive to be put in the dryer and she has only used a clothes line or drying rack her whole life but because our yard can accommodate a clothes line I should allow it. I don\u2019t want the neighbor to see her put her underwear on the clothes line and I think they will complain as it ruins the surrounding house value.\n\nShe wants fill up a large part of the downstairs with her stuff. Our place isn\u2019t very big and she wants to bring her skis, rock climbing equipment like ropes, harness etc, 2 bikes and her winter tires. She also wants to buy a mount to install for the bikes for the winter. She doesn\u2019t have many other things like clothes but we don\u2019t have a big basement (it\u2019s like a half basement) and she wants to put her stuff downstairs. I want to convert the downstairs into a gym for me but she wants to move her stuff out of her parents place because they are going to downsize when they retire in a year or 2.\n\nI told her she needs to either not do these things like the clothes line or pay for the storage place and dog. She refuses though and says either I let her move in with the agreed upon rent or she\u2019s finding another place to live. She\u2019s current back with her parents and I\u2019ve been paying for the whole place alone. She thinks I\u2019m the asshole for penny pinching her but I don\u2019t think a landlord would be ok with her dog and clothesline so I\u2019m doing her a favor. She also makes more (130k vs my 90k) so it\u2019s not she can\u2019t pay her fair share.", "created_utc": 1686328857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145a56u/aita_for_expecting_my_gf_to_move_in_and_listen_to/", "score": 270, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Would you rather pay for a storage to the tires? Skiis and rock climbing equipment don't take much room, it's totally possible to squeeze them in small space. Bikes do take some room but if the area isn't safe and you don't have a garage for them it's better to keep them inside.\nSo after all, you do not have a ground in here. YTA.

Obviously you\u2019ll have to make some sacrifices/ compromise somewhere down the line when it comes to certain things. I can\u2019t suggest or make that decision for y\u2019all but definitely let her have a thing or two of her own. Let her have a designated spot for her outdoor equipment, but if you don\u2019t have room suggest selling it / get a storage unit together (put some of your bigger items you don\u2019t need in there too so it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re the asshole). \n\nAs for the dog, if she\u2019s willing to pay the deposit for it, I don\u2019t see why not. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u201cpenny pinching\u201d. If I was in her shoes (moving into your* house) I\u2019d offer to cover that right off the bat. It\u2019s an animal, they can potentially damage things wether it\u2019s an accident or not.  It\u2019s literally \u2018the price you pay\u2019 for owning an animal. \n\nBut if you\u2019re not willing to make space for her and her belongings, she\u2019s probably better off in her own place.", "YYTA what you\u2019re trying to pull isn\u2019t \u201cliving together\u201d you want her to pay have the costs and have her stay with you. Her wanting her dog (which you knew she had) isn\u2019t blindsiding you. When you live somewhere you also bring your belongings and you think she should pay extra for that? A clothesline. Really? They exist for a reason and the US is one of the only country\u2019s that regular households have them in. your ego is too soft to let your girlfriend you \u201clove\u201d to hang , say, a $200 dress outside to dry so it is properly cared for? So far she\u2019s making the right decision and not moving there. Hopefully she ends it for good. You sound horrific to deal with. Her income doesn\u2019t matter.

House is in your name, but you expect her to pay half the mortgage and then get what out of it? She apparently cant have belongings you don\u2019t like, and more importantly her dog!

But saying no flat out is harsh and a AH move.\n\nWhen my husband (boyfriend at the time) bought a house together. He knew that the cats i had were coming with me. He hated cats but knew i loved them and they were my cats. Now he loves them. My husband had a large collection of gaming consoles and memorabilia. Like a lot. We compromised keeping half in the living room and half in his office. Now our son enjoys all the mario stuff. \n\nWhen we finished the basement we both had s long conversation about how the space needed to work for everyone. Now it\u2019s a great flex space. He wanted a gym but once it was finished he realized that he couldn\u2019t fit a gym down there with the ceiling heights and he rather have a large dart board and movie theater.

Why on earth do you have such a problem with drying clothes outside? It will save you a fortune on energy bills - tumble dryers are insanely wasteful. \n\nAnd that aside, you don\u2019t sound like you care for her very much.

It might have been okay if these rules were being set for a tenant but for you to list out such rules for your partner is just unreasonable.\n The only thing you are conveying to your gf is how much of a controlling person you are. Anyways good for her, she gets to witness this behaviour now itself.\nMoney is not the issue at all lmao.", "Yta. You want her to pay a deposit to cover potential damage? She's your partner not your tenant. If you're not willing to give her a say in the home you share you shouldn't live together.

The dog thing is tricky and should have been discussed but the clothesline? That\u2019s ridiculous. A lot of delicate clothes cannot be put in a drier and need to be put on a drying rack or clothesline.

Storing your stuff in your house? Normal. \n\nTrying to dictate the life of a person that pays 50% of your living cost? Not so clever.", "YTA. If you truly loved her, you\u2019d make room for her life, dog and all, and do your best to ensure she\u2019s got the best hobby equipment you two can afford.

You\u2019re more controlling the a landlord. Don\u2019t be surprised if she decides to leave and then what? You\u2019re paying for all of it by yourself because you only want things pure way", "You sound like a hard person to live with.", "Yta. You basically want her to move in. Subsidize your mortgage and bills be responsible for the place but have no equity or equal say even in bringing in her own posessions because it's \"your house\". You don't  want a partner you want a tenant you can fuck. She makes good money hopefully she uses it to get herself a better living situation and a boyfriend who sees her as an equal and valuable partner.", "YTA. Jeez, landlords don't demand that much money every month for a dog. They usually require much less. You're acting like this is only your house but she's contributing to the mortgage and all the other bills. And your gym would take up a lot of space but you're complaining about her stuff. You're being way too controlling. You're also greedy and way too eager to stuff your pockets with her money just because she earns more than you. And dryers can damage clothes; it's better for the clothes and the environment to use a clothing line. It sounds like you don't want her to make any changes to the house. You're demanding that everything be your way and that's selfish.", "YTA.\n\nYou seem super controlling. If you don't change I hope she has a happy life with her dog that will definitely love her better than you.", "I was on the fence about the dog thing but the rest of it makes you definitely the asshole. You are being weirdly controlling.

Doesn't sound like you two should live together.", "You sound like an absolute arrogant asshole quite frankly. You are not mature enough to be in a serious relationship. They take compromise. You don't want to make any. I get you own the property, but if you legitimately think any woman is going to live with you there, pay half the mortgage, and not expect at least a little bit of input on the decor and aesthetic, then you are truly a dumbass of the highest order.\n\nShe should leave you, yesterday. \n\nYTA.", "Sorry but YTA\n\nIt is one thing to have a tenant ask for these things and refusing - but it is another when it is your girlfriend who you **were** looking to build with.

And now suddenly you don't want it there at all, but it can't stay with her parents either. So you're essentially forcing her to get rid of her dog. \n\nAlso, not all clothing can go in the dryer. Bras shouldn't go in a dryer, a lot of shirts can't go in a dryer either. Some pants and fabrics in general also can't be dried with a dryer.

Why would your gf pay extra monthly for possible future damage her dog might cause, as opposed to just paying for any damage once and if it happens? Not having a clothesline because of how other's might perceive it is juvenile and line drying is better for clothing, the environment and the wallet! Not every item that is washed (like crotchless underwear) needs to be hung outside, as you well know since you are already familiar with interior folding racks. Laughter would be a great response if you ever get a complaint from a neighbour that a view of your gf's drying line is devaluing their property - that's ridiculous! And not enough space for her stuff? Decided together who gets what space (roughly equal of course) and if she can't fit all her things into her space she'll need to downsize, or get a storage barn for the yard, or rent a storage space.

That\u2019s a huge \ud83d\udea9", "It doesn't sound like she is (he has made one comment thus far on how she doesn't own any of the duplex) so essentially, what he's doing is getting her to pay half of everything while legally maintaining full control of what happens with the duplex. \n\nSo, he's essentially \"renting\" to her (price would be about what she would pay to rent somewhere else), instead of co-habitating with his girlfriend.", "OP in 2 weeks - My GF changed her mind about moving in with me and now I have to pay the whole mortgage myself!  Im the victim here right?", "No he wants someone to pay his shit and someone he can fuck who doesn\u2019t defy him and his rules. OP is more than just an AH but I don\u2019t want to get banned over someone like OP.", "Also gets them cleaner because the sun will help kill any germs left on them", "ehh kinda but at the same time he chose to date someone who had a dog...did he really think her dog was going to stay at her parents' house indefinitely?", "Then he shouldn't date someone with a pet, it's very simple actually", "If you continue reading the post, it's not just about the dog. He also doesn't want a clothesline hanging in the yard and he also doesn't want her stuff in the basement.", "I\u2019m in uk , some people in America consider them a poor person thing like having one because you can\u2019t afford a dryer. His girlfriend is right though dryer ruin most clothes only use our for underwear, socks , towels and bedding in the bad weather months.\nAlso some HOA (home owners associations) in America I believe can ban them", "In the US dryers are much more common and used much more but many people still have clotheslines. It's a bit regional too... the southeast and New England I see a lot more clotheslines even in well-to-do neighborhoods than I do in the Intermountain West. Which is funny because it's so arid here clothes dry almost faster than the dryer!", "Hatred of clothes lines is a very US suburban phenomenon. They\u2019ve become coded as poor, low class, eye sores, etc and some HOAs explicitly ban them. It can be more common in some areas though, I know a lot of more established New England suburban/semi urban places where it\u2019s more common. I hardly see any in the Bay Area which is honestly shocking since we have the weather for it most of the year. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s probably been a lot of marketing to push drier and drier sheet sales too. I really want them to make a comeback, it\u2019s so much better for your clothes and uses way less energy!", "I'm in the Pacific northwest of the US and every house I've lived in has had a clothesline. Granted due to the weather its only really used in the late spring to mid autumn.", "It depends where you are in the US, but seriously, I would love a clothes lines. And the funny part is, most people who use them are upper class.", "Same here. We have a drier, but only use it to finish things off or if we\u2019ve run out of drying space. The bedding usually goes in the drier in the winter though. Not enough space for that. We had to ask our landlord if we could install a rotary line in the garden as the one here when we moved in was attached to the fence - which was fine until the one owned by next door fell down in a storm! Every dry day we have washing out, even in the winter as it\u2019s windy enough to dry things most of the time.", "I\u2019m UK and I live for sunny days and putting stuff on the line \ud83e\udd23. Washed dried and put away the same day. All smells fresh, no shrinkage, kids stains vanish and no electricity wasted. It\u2019s soooo satisfying. These Americans don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing!", "It actually is pretty uncommon in the us but people still hang up some things inside (I literally just did it today. I live in an apt so no clothesline outside). But its not THAT uncommon lol. Had one as a kid at our house, neighbors had one. Some hoas won\u2019t allow them which is nuts but overall id say its much less common but not unheard of or as unusual as op is making it seem.", "He wants to be a landlord who gets sex and cleaning and food cooked for him, i think. I mean thats what it sounds like", "This - and somehow wants to be a landlord that says \u201cyou can\u2019t store your skis in the basement.\u201d", "& (most) landlords do allow pets", "But... they'll see her underwear!\ud83d\ude44", "Yeah I don't think this is a \"suburbia\" thing I think this is a \"I can't bear to look like those tacky poors\" thing", "My girlfriend wants to move in together. But get this\u2026she wants to actually live there AND bring her stuff!", "Plus hes getting the house still long term. She\u2019s helping him pay the mortgage and other fees and down the line he will make money from it.", "Exactly. All the money that she's putting in is going towards his equity on the property.", "Of course she is. Cause \"sHe mAkEs MoRe mOnEy tHaN mE\"", "Same, I hang like 95% of my laundry.", "There's always someone desperate enough, with low enough self esteem, but your absolutely correct.", "And it seems like he would make her pay for any damages too. If the dog like, scratches the floor she'll have to pay to fix it, plus the $100/month.", "no seriously. i would feel so suffocated if i was the girlfriend. idk what their relationship was like pre-move but my god from the way it is written, i cannot imagine it was much better than this", "Probably! I doubt he truly listened to her when she said having the dog stay with her parents was temporary until they found a place to live that allows dogs. Honestly I doubt he truly every actually listened to her at all.", "LOL, exactly. I'd take my 100k plus income and find my own place where I can put up a clothing line haha", "Well, it is ONLY your place OP. & you\u2019ve ensured that.", "Yes, in HOAs you're almost never allowed to have them. Which is why I refuse to live in a place with an HOA. Unfortunately something like 80% of new homes have an HOA built-in...", "It's so weird because clothes dried on the line are just so much better than in the tumble dryer. I'm so relieved we've had line drying weather here in the UK recently and I haven't had to switch the dryer on at all.", "Precisely why I am moving to a house with no HOA. I cannot wait to have a clothesline! Electric dryers are one of the appliances that use the most energy. But I just love the smell of fresh sheets right off the line.", "I consider it a nostalgia thing because nobody I know uses one anymore (in the \u201880s and \u201890s they were common). Dryers are more convenient, though tbh I wish it would come back because air-drying on a line has gotta be massively more environmentally friendly, not to mention easier on the clothes.", "I've heard this is why some Americans don't like public transport, it apparently suggests you can't afford a car. I don't know how true this is though.", "That might be the stupidest reason to not to have a clothes line.\n\n\"Omg George, we can't dry our clothes the most natural way possible, the neighbors will think we are poor despite owning 3 brand new SUVs and a mcmansion!\"\n\nLike. What.", "Good ole American brand classism. If you can afford to waste resources you should because otherwise people might think you don't because you're poor rather than because you're not an idiot who wastes resources to prove you can.", "Weird. I\u2019m in the US and had never heard this attitude. I don\u2019t use a clothes line because I\u2019m lazy and shove things in the dryer even though they\u2019re meant to be air dried. If I see someone has a clothes line I think they must take good care of their clothes.", "I'm in New England and they were very common, until the gypsy moth infestations in the 1980s. Your white laundry would come in covered in brown spots and have to be washed again.", "he wants a bang maid mommy TENANT girlfriend. can we sink any lower?", "I can't clutch my pearls any harder!", "While reading the post I was lmao, and your comment describes the exact feel of this whole story. \n\nOP, YTA. \nI guess you'd just want to be a landlord, so you should just rent a part of the house then. \nAlso, r/amitheex", "This. He owns the home & she\u2019s paying his bills for him while not being allowed to be herself or have her own stuff with her.", "right!? this post is so wild, like she literally just wants to live her life in her home and he's upset\ud83d\udc80", "Legit get excited when there\u2019s good drying weather.", "I'm in the UK and have only ever had a tumble dryer as a uni student - and I live in South Wales.", "I can\u2019t stomach the idea of my clean underwear or clothes hanging out in the breeze for bees or birds to poop on or for dirt to get blown on, but more power to you.", "Never come to Scotland if u don't want to see underwear on a clothesline...\n\nYou'll be scandalised! \n\nWe're all barbarians here with our clothing lines! /s", "I guess he could go to any European country and see such \"babarians\" xD\n\nHe should be happy with the clothes line - It saves you costs of water, electricity and it's better for the environment.", "Exactly, my mum has a dryer and it's horrible on clothes. Everything need ironed and it costs so much to run! It's so bad for the environment!\n\nI say this now looking at my clothes horse in my sunny garden covered in underpants."]}
