Recently I got some money after my grandpa passed and was able to buy a duplex. I put down 20% and she and I have agreed to split the mortgage, property taxes, insurance, utilities etc. It comes out to $1000 for each and she agreed. But then she wanted to make changes to the house I don\u2019t agree with and bring her dog.\n\nHer dog has been living with her parents for the 3 months we moved into together (the place I rented before buying). She wants to bring him because he\u2019s her dog and her parents only agreed to let him stay with her temporarily. But I don\u2019t want a dog to move in with us and potentially damage the house. He isn\u2019t known to damage stuff as far as I know but he does run around the house and I want her to pay $100 extra a month for potential damage or $1000 extra as a damage deposit. She is angry because we agreed on $1000 and no damage deposit and feels like I\u2019m making it to hard to bring her dog.\n\nShe also wants to put a clothes line in my backyard and I find it weird and tacky. Maybe it\u2019s because I grew up in suburbia but everyone I know uses the dryer but she insists she needs to have a clothes line and hates the dryer. She claims her clothing to too expensive to be put in the dryer and she has only used a clothes line or drying rack her whole life but because our yard can accommodate a clothes line I should allow it. I don\u2019t want the neighbor to see her put her underwear on the clothes line and I think they will complain as it ruins the surrounding house value.\n\nShe wants fill up a large part of the downstairs with her stuff. Our place isn\u2019t very big and she wants to bring her skis, rock climbing equipment like ropes, harness etc, 2 bikes and her winter tires. She also wants to buy a mount to install for the bikes for the winter. She doesn\u2019t have many other things like clothes but we don\u2019t have a big basement (it\u2019s like a half basement) and she wants to put her stuff downstairs. I want to convert the downstairs into a gym for me but she wants to move her stuff out of her parents place because they are going to downsize when they retire in a year or 2.\n\nI told her she needs to either not do these things like the clothes line or pay for the storage place and dog. She refuses though and says either I let her move in with the agreed upon rent or she\u2019s finding another place to live. She\u2019s current back with her parents and I\u2019ve been paying for the whole place alone. She thinks I\u2019m the asshole for penny pinching her but I don\u2019t think a landlord would be ok with her dog and clothesline so I\u2019m doing her a favor. She also makes more (130k vs my 90k) so it\u2019s not she can\u2019t pay her fair share.", "created_utc": 1686328857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145a56u/aita_for_expecting_my_gf_to_move_in_and_listen_to/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Would you rather pay for a storage to the tires? Skiis and rock climbing equipment don't take much room, it's totally possible to squeeze them in small space. Bikes do take some room but if the area isn't safe and you don't have a garage for them it's better to keep them inside.\nSo after all, you do not have a ground in here. YTA.

Obviously you\u2019ll have to make some sacrifices/ compromise somewhere down the line when it comes to certain things. I can\u2019t suggest or make that decision for y\u2019all but definitely let her have a thing or two of her own. Let her have a designated spot for her outdoor equipment, but if you don\u2019t have room suggest selling it / get a storage unit together (put some of your bigger items you don\u2019t need in there too so it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re the asshole). \n\nAs for the dog, if she\u2019s willing to pay the deposit for it, I don\u2019t see why not. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u201cpenny pinching\u201d. If I was in her shoes (moving into your* house) I\u2019d offer to cover that right off the bat. It\u2019s an animal, they can potentially damage things wether it\u2019s an accident or not.  It\u2019s literally \u2018the price you pay\u2019 for owning an animal. \n\nBut if you\u2019re not willing to make space for her and her belongings, she\u2019s probably better off in her own place.", "YYTA what you\u2019re trying to pull isn\u2019t \u201cliving together\u201d you want her to pay have the costs and have her stay with you. Her wanting her dog (which you knew she had) isn\u2019t blindsiding you. When you live somewhere you also bring your belongings and you think she should pay extra for that? A clothesline. Really? They exist for a reason and the US is one of the only country\u2019s that regular households have them in. your ego is too soft to let your girlfriend you \u201clove\u201d to hang , say, a $200 dress outside to dry so it is properly cared for? So far she\u2019s making the right decision and not moving there. Hopefully she ends it for good. You sound horrific to deal with. Her income doesn\u2019t matter.

House is in your name, but you expect her to pay half the mortgage and then get what out of it? She apparently cant have belongings you don\u2019t like, and more importantly her dog!

But saying no flat out is harsh and a AH move.\n\nWhen my husband (boyfriend at the time) bought a house together. He knew that the cats i had were coming with me. He hated cats but knew i loved them and they were my cats. Now he loves them. My husband had a large collection of gaming consoles and memorabilia. Like a lot. We compromised keeping half in the living room and half in his office. Now our son enjoys all the mario stuff. \n\nWhen we finished the basement we both had s long conversation about how the space needed to work for everyone. Now it\u2019s a great flex space. He wanted a gym but once it was finished he realized that he couldn\u2019t fit a gym down there with the ceiling heights and he rather have a large dart board and movie theater.

Why on earth do you have such a problem with drying clothes outside? It will save you a fortune on energy bills - tumble dryers are insanely wasteful. \n\nAnd that aside, you don\u2019t sound like you care for her very much.

It might have been okay if these rules were being set for a tenant but for you to list out such rules for your partner is just unreasonable.\n The only thing you are conveying to your gf is how much of a controlling person you are.

The dog thing is tricky and should have been discussed but the clothesline? That\u2019s ridiculous. A lot of delicate clothes cannot be put in a drier and need to be put on a drying rack or clothesline.

Storing your stuff in your house? Normal. \n\nTrying to dictate the life of a person that pays 50% of your living cost? Not so clever.", "YTA. If you truly loved her, you\u2019d make room for her life, dog and all, and do your best to ensure she\u2019s got the best hobby equipment you two can afford.

You\u2019re paying for all of it by yourself because you only want things pure way", "You sound like a hard person to live with.", "Yta. You basically want her to move in. Subsidize your mortgage and bills be responsible for the place but have no equity or equal say even in bringing in her own posessions because it's \"your house\". You don't  want a partner you want a tenant you can fuck. She makes good money hopefully she uses it to get herself a better living situation and a boyfriend who sees her as an equal and valuable partner.", "YTA. Jeez, landlords don't demand that much money every month for a dog. They usually require much less. You're acting like this is only your house but she's contributing to the mortgage and all the other bills. And your gym would take up a lot of space but you're complaining about her stuff. You're being way too controlling. You're also greedy and way too eager to stuff your pockets with her money just because she earns more than you. And dryers can damage clothes; it's better for the clothes and the environment to use a clothing line. It sounds like you don't want her to make any changes to the house. You're demanding that everything be your way and that's selfish.", "YTA.\n\nYou seem super controlling. If you don't change I hope she has a happy life with her dog that will definitely love her better than you.", "I was on the fence about the dog thing but the rest of it makes you definitely the asshole. You are being weirdly controlling.

Doesn't sound like you two should live together.", "You sound like an absolute arrogant asshole quite frankly. You are not mature enough to be in a serious relationship. They take compromise. You don't want to make any. I get you own the property, but if you legitimately think any woman is going to live with you there, pay half the mortgage, and not expect at least a little bit of input on the decor and aesthetic, then you are truly a dumbass of the highest order.\n\nShe should leave you, yesterday. \n\nYTA.", "Sorry but YTA\n\nIt is one thing to have a tenant ask for these things and refusing - but it is another when it is your girlfriend who you **were** looking to build with.

How important is this clothes line in the long run?  You may find it off putting but is having it up worth losing your relationship?  Same with the things in the basement.  Is her stuff going to take up the whole basement?  Can they be arranged to also include some of your workout equipment?  Can she store it elsewhere?
