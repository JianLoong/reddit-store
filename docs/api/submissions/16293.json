{"id": 16293, "submission_id": "136jd7o", "title": "WIBTA for uninviting a guest to my wedding because of her request?", "selftext": "My fiance and I are getting married in the UK, and I decided to invite an old friend of mine from when I used to live in North America. When I was following up with the RSVPs and checking if she would be coming to the wedding, she told me that she has actually just moved to Dubai. She said that she is pretty busy with the move, and juggling a baby, a new job selling real estate and planning a potential wedding a month before mine. I was a little taken aback that she didn't inform me about her wedding either, but she said it was a smaller affair. So that's fine I guess. She said she would then get back to me later on whether she was still planning to come to mine. \n\nA few days later, she reached out and said that she should be able to come to my wedding in the UK. We also got to talking about her move to Dubai and she explained that she wanted to save on high tax, and inheritance tax which were the major factors for her move. She then said that UK citizens are the 2nd highest investors for Dubai properties and then asked if she could do a presentation on selling Dubai properties. I was in denial about what she was asking? And clarified if she meant that she wanted to do a presentation at some real estate conference at the same time when she came for my wedding? But she was actually asking for 5 minutes to do her presentation to MY GUESTS at MY WEDDING and said she would offer me commission if anyone bought her Dubai apartments! I was shocked at the time and didn't know how to respond. My first reply to her was \"I don't think that would be appropriate. Maybe you can talk to a few people there if you want who may be likely to buy\". After which, she said that she will need to make the trip in that case\n\nAfter a day of processing the ridiculous request she made, I then sent her a text and told her not to even talk about this to any of my guests if she were to come, as I don't want her harrassing my other guests with her sales pitch during the wedding. She agreed and said she understands.\n\nHowever, I still don't feel comfortable with the fact that her initial objective was to sell apartments at my wedding and I really don't want her coming now. The wedding is in 3 months and she's missed the RSVP deadline and hasn't RSVP'd yet. And we haven't spoken about it since. Hence, would I be the asshole if I told her definitely not to come anymore? I also feel really awkward and bad about straight up uninviting her.", "created_utc": 1683117504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136jd7o/wibta_for_uninviting_a_guest_to_my_wedding/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She never cared about your wedding, she cared about an opportunity to sell.", "NTA,  despite anything I'm sure others will have to say, this is your wedding and your invite list.

I have no idea if she is still planning to come now or not, but it would be bad if she bought flight tickets already before doing the RSVP.", "Yeah. Initially I was shocked at the audacity of her request. I was even questioning whether this was a normal thing?! But when I spoke to my fianc\u00e9, he was appalled about this and said that she is going to be the biggest buzz kill if she came and started pitching to our guests.", "Yeah. I was thinking of using the missed deadline as an excuse to uninvite her.", "You're probably right about that!", "Yeah. This is what we're discussing too. Should we maybe just follow up anyway, because there is also a likelihood she's not coming since I've banned her from doing her pitch", "Can I interest you in some essential oils? I just can't believe someone would feel comfortable interrupting someone else's wedding to give a presentation on real estate.", "Is the RSVP online or a card she has to mail back?", "Just to make sure she knows she cannot attend, send her a short text saying, \"You missed the RSVP deadline and final guest numbers have been given to the venue, etc. If I'm ever in Dubai, I'll give you a call.\"  I mean if you don't do that, she may show up at your wedding and it'd be a scene to eject her. NTA at all and what nerve this woman has!", "Better to confront it with truth imo but each to their own. Congrats on your wedding and best of luck with this", "It's online! Wedding website. I had a few guests who bought tickets before doing the RSVPs too. Which is why I wonder if she may do the same", "If the deadline has passed, can you disable the link to RSVP? \n\nI am sure some people booked tickets before RSVP'ing because they wanted to make sure they could get reasonably priced tickets before committing to attending - but I assume the people you are talking about RSVP'ed prior to the deadline. Or at least prior to however far past the deadline you are now. \n\nHer not being considerate enough to RSVP on time (even to say no) is just one more mark against her in my book. So I personally do not care if she has booked her ticket.\n\nThis person clearly only sees your wedding as a potential business opportunity - so I think you need to stop spending so much emotional effort on worrying about being a good friend to her. If you would feel better just sending her a message that she is no longer invited, go ahead and do that!"]}
