{"id": 16293, "submission_id": "136jd7o", "title": "WIBTA for uninviting a guest to my wedding because of her request?", "selftext": "My British fiance and I are getting married in the UK, and I decided to invite an old friend of mine from when I used to live in North America. When I followed up on her RSVP, she told me that she has actually just moved to Dubai. She said that she is pretty busy with the move, and juggling a baby, her new real estate brokerage (she has always been in real estate in North America) and planning a potential wedding a month before mine. I was a little taken aback that she didn't inform me about her wedding either, but she said it was a smaller affair. So that's fine I guess. She said she would then get back to me later on whether she was still planning to come to mine. \n\nA few days later, she reached out and said that her partner and baby, and herself should be able to come to my wedding in the UK. We also got to talking about her move to Dubai and she explained that she wanted to save on income tax, and inheritance tax which were the major factors for her move. She then said that UK citizens are the 2nd biggest investors for Dubai properties and then asked if she could do a presentation to sell Dubai properties. I was in denial about what she was asking? And clarified if she meant that she wanted to do a presentation at some real estate conference at the same time when she came for my wedding? But she was actually asking for 5 minutes to do her presentation to MY GUESTS at MY WEDDING and said she would offer me commission if anyone bought her Dubai apartments! I was shocked at the time and didn't know how to respond. My first reply to her was \"I don't think that would be appropriate. Maybe you can talk to a few people there who may be interested if you want\". After which, she said that she will need to make the trip in that case. She was also spamming me with loads of videos about living in Dubai and her properties for sale throughout the conversation. She then indicated on my wedding registry that she (and her partner) will give me \u00a3200 as a wedding gift (This was never sent yet and no transaction was made)\n\nShe continued to send lots of brochures and videos about the benefits of living in Dubai every couple of hours and I repeatedly told her I was already settled in the UK and am not planning on moving. After a day of processing the ridiculous request she had made, I then sent her a text and told her not to even talk about this to any of my guests if she were to come, as I don't want her harrassing my other guests with her sales pitch during the wedding. She agreed and said she understands. She then immediately spoke about my registry and asked if PayPal was okay to give my wedding gift.. (still no transaction made yet) \n\nHowever, I still don't feel comfortable with the fact that her initial objective was to sell apartments at my wedding and I really don't want her coming now. The wedding is in 3 months and she's missed the RSVP deadline and hasn't RSVP'd yet. We haven't spoken about it since. Hence, would I be the asshole if I told her definitely not to come anymore? I also feel really awkward and bad about straight up uninviting her.", "created_utc": 1683117504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136jd7o/wibta_for_uninviting_a_guest_to_my_wedding/", "score": 526, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
