This is an EVERY DAY occurrence. That doesn\u2019t even touch on the daycare kids he wakes up. I feel so burnt out, full of rage and contempt when he does this.

It\u2019s whenever he finishes his last job. Our rest time is from 12:30-2:30.

Ask your MIL to come and witness this for a few days (if she\u2019s reasonable) and hopefully she\u2019ll help chew him out. \n\nSounds like he\u2019s doing it on purpose. Is he this much of a waste of space in the rest of your life?", "lol. this makes no sense. YTA obviously. i dont care what reason it is but you are attempting to stop someone from coming home? take your daycare into a room or elsewhere. thats frankly ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nHe's being loud, he knows it. He says you're blowing it out of proportion, which is BS. This is your business. You deserve a break as well. He shouldn't be coming home for lunch if he's disrupting the kids.\n\nYou have told him that you're getting burnt out, but he's dismissive and doesn't seem to care. He's being a huge A H.", "NTA he won't stay away because what he is doing is deliberate. He is trying to show you dominance. It is a power play to say this is my house and I can do what I like in it. You are subject to me. He is showing you lack of respect and at the same time deep insecurity. He wants to show that he matters, that he is important, that he plays a part in what you are doing. It is attention seeking, look at me! My sister in law is married to a guy exactly like this. I spent years watching him, trying to figure out why he behaved like that. Once I worked it out I saw it in other people.", "Would a white noise machine help the kids sleep through Husbandzilla\u2019s lunchtime rampage?\n\nNTA. I would tear him a new one. At the very least, make him read this AITA thread.", "100% NTA, your husband is being entirely inconsiderate of your job, your time (as you don't get a break), and you needing help. It really isn't hard to walk around and not walk like a herd of elephants but he clearly doesn't care. So no NTA and he can find somewhere else to eat", "You see I have a different take on that, I don't think you have the right to tell someone that they cannot be in their own home if they want to, for any reason. That suggests that OP has the majority say over how the house they share is run, which just wouldn't be acceptable to me.", "Um, wtf?!", "She may not be able to\u2026some states require day cares have specific rest/nap times, not even taking into account his flexible schedule.", "Uhh not only is she running a daycare out of her home, which provides the family income, but she is also taking care of her own daughter and saving them quite a bit on paying another daycare provider. Pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t be having this issue if she was a SAHM to her daughter only.", "You can always tell who has never experienced a successful relationship in their life. Your arguments sound demented", "In Australia everyone who lives on the premises has to have the same background checks as the day care person but can't do the actual care without the right training.", "A lot of toddlers have an immense fear of missing out and are more resting than sleeping at nap time. So yes the sound of a treat being opened will 'wake' up a resting child.", "It's not 'his home' it is 'their home' and also 'their business' that she is expected to run professionally in order to help pay for 'their bills'.", "if he is an inconsiderate bumbling fool who is so noisy that he cannot work quietly without disturbing small CHILDREN , she is in her rights to ask him to stop", "Right? I bet all the comments about moving nap time come from people that don\u2019t have children.", "Shame and also kinda alarming. I wouldn't like to leave my kid where non-employees can potentially just hang around.\n\nNo offence, I am sure eveyone in your household is perfectly fine! I guess I am just used to that extra peace of mind.", "one of my little brothers was so sensitive to sounds that even a mild sniff would startle him awake", "A comment from OP 5 hours before your comment:\n\n\n\"My families all know my husband and their children aren\u2019t getting disturbed as much as they used to since i set boundaries but he still wakes our daughter which risks waking other children.\"", "At least you'd know they had to pass a background check", "That\u2019s when you get a white noise machine.", "They don't have access to their house.", "Why does he have to come home? Why can\u2019t he eat at his place of employment instead of his wife\u2019s? \n\nYou can tell you don\u2019t work with kids.", "Yes she should. But your husband is in some kind of pissing contest to assert his manly manhood by disrupting your day. You need to get a few days in a row where you get your break so you can have a clear mind to assess exactly how much of this selfishness you're willing to tolerate full stop. Because he doesn't appear respect you or your daughter as people. He doesn't respect your job. He doesn't respect your clients. He doesn't appear to care for you at all. And at some point that becomes a deal breaker. Given his refusal to be considerate or constructive it might be time to start finding out what alternative solutions would look like. And for that you'll need a rested mind.", "*I was going to ask if he has ADHD, it sounds like a male with ADHD.* \n\nFeel free to look at r/ADHD_partners for support and/or if you need to scream into the void. \n\nADHD DOES NOT MAKE YOU AN ASSHOLE. Again, having ADHD does not make you an asshole. And, he\u2019s not fucking helpless. He absolutely positively can choose to not be a dick, to eat lunch elsewhere, to put reminders in his car, on his phone, tattoo it on his forearm if he has to to remember to text you when he\u2019s on the way home, or else just go to his mother\u2019s house. He can choose to work on his empathy. He is actively choosing to be an inconsiderate ass. \n\nNTA and please stop taking his bullshit.\n\nEdited to say, and I would look at other areas of your lives where you feel he\u2019s using ADHD \u00e0 la weaponised incompetence.", "[removed]", "Yeah she should make it impossible to have a break there. Just invent a bunch of urgent jobs he has to do and keep hassling him till he leaves. I'd be livid with him.", ">How easy would it be to put a note on his steering wheel that says *text your wife*? \n\nVery easy. And it would work maybe twice or thrice.
