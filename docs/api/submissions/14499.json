This is an EVERY DAY occurrence. That doesn\u2019t even touch on the daycare kids he wakes up. I feel so burnt out, full of rage and contempt when he does this.

He goes out of town for work almost monthly and nap time goes seamlessly. \n\nI\u2019ve been telling him for months I wish he would pack a lunch and just spend his lunch at work because it\u2019s taking a toll on my mental health to not get a break.

I just don\u2019t see the compromise because he wakes them up and I\u2019m left to deal with it and I don\u2019t get a chance to even eat or check my phone some days. \n\nEdit to clarify: his lunch doesn\u2019t start at a specific time each day. It\u2019s whenever he finishes his last job. Our rest time is from 12:30-2:30.
