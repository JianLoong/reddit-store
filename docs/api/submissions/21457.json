He sounds like one of those in documentaries about people who are really good at acting socially and then getting bored of pretending they're a human with genuine emotions. Forgot the scientific term for it. He's an adult. He should take responsibility for getting so easily bored of people.", "Going out on a limb for ESH. Everyone seems to be overlooking the fact that Wren is kinda a jerk (yes convincing people you really like them, then getting bored and ignoring them is an asshole move, especially when you as his wife then have to meditate things and make excuses for him). \n\nYou should stop lying to people to protect Wren from consequences of his own dick behavior. It's not helping anyone. It's not that he's busy, it's that he does this every time and he deserves the fallout from that (which is going to blow back on you at some point as you're seeing). \n\nAnd it's weird that your friend was so distraught that your husband stopped taking her calls she started crying.", "ESH - you are a liar and a gaslighter. \n\nWhy are you doing his dirty work for him?

Just in general sense, you shouldn't have to regularly lie to cover up a spouse's... anything, but especially not a personality quirk that makes them treat other people badly. And to be clear, this *is* bad treatment. People aren't toys to use and discard. You say he's very good at making friends and making people feel special, but if he knows he's going to get bored with them and hurt them, why is he making that effort in the first place to draw them in? People are *lonely* and most are genuinely thrilled to make new friends.   \n\n\nYou're acting more like a PR manager than a spouse, and your spouse has a worrying lack of basic empathy for other people. Instead of making excuses for him, maybe it's time to take him to task a bit and ask him to try a bit harder to think of other people's feelings. His aren't the only feelings that matter, and he's going to end up isolating you if he hurts all your friends with his callousness.", "ESH\n\nI think this whole situation needs an injection of adult communication skills.\n\nIf Wren doesn't like someone & would prefer not to hang out with or talk to them, he should be able to put on his big boy pants & just say so, in a respectful way. I really hope he is at least willing & able to hang out with your friends in group settings with you?? If not, that's even worse..\n\nI also think the way you're handling this isn't okay. Telling a white lie in order to protect your SO can be okay, like if the other person has hurt them or something & they're not ready to address it. But this is your *friend*, and as far as your post goes, Alice hasn't done anything wrong. So I think she deserves better here. As it stands you're just covering for Wren's needless immaturity, & enabling it to continue. I would recommend speaking to him about his actions, that are forcing you into the middle of a situation that is *his* responsibility. Then politely tell Alice that she should direct her questions to him (assuming that he agrees to stop rudely ghosting people).\n\nImo Alice is kind of overreacting to the situation. It's not such a huge deal if her friend's partner doesn't really want to hang out one on one. Especially since ya'll have only become friends recently, it's a little weird to me that this has made her so intensely upset. That combined with the name calling & jumping to accusing you, has me raising an eyebrow, tbh.

People may love him, but that he drops everyone so completely makes him a bit of an ass, and it\u2019s ok that people figure that out.

Do you think the second option is a possibility? I\u2019m not trying to accuse him of crossing a line, but if he\u2019s the life of the party type person, it\u2019s easy for people to read further into it or assign it more meaning than it should. \n\nI think it\u2019d be worth talking to Wren about how he leaves people \u201cdistraught and confused and wondering what they did wrong\u201d, because this really isn\u2019t normal or healthy and he\u2019s the common factor. It\u2019s unfair that you have to deal with his trail of carelessness, and unfair that it interferes with your friendships. It\u2019s kind you stick by your husband, but can you ask him if you could tell Alice that this is just what he does? Would he be annoyed or feel betrayed if you just told the truth?

I don\u2019t like the culture of diagnosing strangers online, but giving him the benefit of the doubt, he might have some unresolved trauma that sees him chasing that high, while craving stability with you, and his love language could be needing reinforcement that you\u2019re as keen on him as ever and unlike his pattern of discarding people - you won\u2019t do that to him. Those can be common traits in people with severe abandonment issues - and him using their lashing out at you as proof they\u2019re \u201cevil\u201d is a part of reliving the severe abandonment cycle, only this time he leaves before he can be hurt and then assess how they respond to being abandoned and if they\u2019re \u201csafe\u201d to let in. \n\nIf none of that is an issue for him and doesn\u2019t need benefit of the doubt, then I\u2019d have to agree with others that he has a false personality and - maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve watched a lot of Criminal Minds lately - it\u2019s actually deeply concerning that he can manipulate people so easily and not care at all that he hurts them. Try to maintain your friendships and let the people you\u2019re close to know Wren does this to his friends so they can be mindful to not let you throw away all your connections and needs just to give your husband the time he says he needs. \n\nMaybe find an activity that the 2 of you can join other people in like a bowling team or something where you create a joint circle of friends where he\u2019s in a situation where he can\u2019t ghost these people because you\u2019ll see them every week and maybe some weekends for birthday celebrations.

When someone acts like that with limited exposure they\u2019re either crazy or something\u2019s happened. \n\nLike, if I met a couple and it turned out the husband was my favourite movie star (or even the person I revere the most) and they were very friendly for a few weeks and then ignored me, I would be saying, \u201csheesh what an AH\u201d, or just stop calling.", "I was thinking the same. It seems the girl fall in love with your husband. And then call you...his wife...to complain he is not calling him back. This woman doesnt respect you. Red flag with this girl. Aldo your husband is an A for the way he behaves with people. The girl is an A for not respecting you. You are not the A here, but everybody else yes", "Wtf never in my life have I heard some dumb shit like this lol someone doesn't hang out with people for more than a few weeks an there automatically some Netflix head case. Listen to op an how they describe there husband he obviously didn't get bored of his wife maybe these people are boring. Your comment screams I've been ghosted by people cuz you probably did some weird shit an now your mad", "Classic narcissism.", "Ya why on earth would she be hysterically crying because he won't speak to her. How old are y'all. This just keeps getting more creepy", "Is anyone going to be shocked when there's an update that reveals that Wren and Alice were sleeping together?", "Also he might not just be getting bored, but he could just feel like it\u2019s time to re-engage in his own life, his own wife, and recoop his energy. And sometimes that means NC with people outside of his introvert bubble.", "I think this could be close to the truth. There\u2019s no way to say this without sounding like I\u2019m bragging, but I\u2019m extremely charismatic. Just about everyone likes me from the second they meet me, and I\u2019ve had multiple casual acquaintances tell me that they they feel so close to me and know we have a special friendship and connection, etc. But just because people feel that way about me doesn\u2019t mean I feel that way about them. I find people I genuinely vibe with at the same rate as anyone else - not that often.\n\nNow, to be fair, this isn\u2019t something I do purposely to manipulate people, whereas based on some of OP\u2019s comments it\u2019s possible Wren does. If so, he\u2019s definitely TA, and OP is another victim being manipulated.", "I can relate to this. I am an extremely charismatic person to hang out with a few times. This is due to me being a great listener and initially not pointing out the problematic views that people hold.\n\nPeople who are part of my close circle know that I am extremely intolerant to casual sexism, colourism and casteism jokes(these are quite common in my Indian culture), and I even have had fall out with really close friends for not being on the same side as me.\n\nPeople feel good on first dates or first meets with me because I pretend to not have a personality and let them bare their soul to me, while they also bare their red flags. They feel am non judgmental. I am extremely judgmental in reality. I just keep my judgements to myself and I ignore them hard if I dislike them since I don\u2019t owe anyone any explanation.\n\nETA: I definitely the neighbor lady is overreacting and OP should not be cleaning her husband\u2019s mess for him.", "This is me haha", "It\u2019s very common for people with NPD to have autistic partners.  Especially NPD men with ASD women.  It\u2019s talked about often in the autistic community.\n\nBecause of our difficulties with social cues/norms, we\u2019re easier to manipulate and can be less aware of what\u2019s normal or appropriate behaviour.  Means we put up with a lot of shit that we really shouldn\u2019t!\n\nMy ex-husband was diagnosed NPD and this dude sounds very much like him.", "I have this problem sometimes. It\u2019s not that I get bored. People just overwhelm me. And I want friends, but my battery runs out or they just get too comfortable and end up being too much to handle much longer. Then the more I pull back the more they reach out. And my anxiety kicks in. And I feel like I owe them something but I can\u2019t provide it. Like they think I\u2019m better than I am. \nHe might not be getting bored. He might just genuinely enjoy meeting people and getting to know them, but then feeling overwhelmed or exhausted by their attempts to gain his attention to the point where he just doesn\u2019t want to deal with them anymore.", "ESH he needs to communicate and stop manipulating people.", "This sounds incredibly manipulative of him. How are you ok with him mistreating people like this?", ">people blame themselves for not keeping his interest\n\nWell isn't it actually *true*?", "He needs to state that he gets bored easily and it's not a reflection of the person, but of his own failings. He should tell people when he thinks they're \"falling\" for his charm. This way, there's no blow back on you. Also, stop giving out your number to people,especially since there's no real friendship.", "You keep saying this, but you *do* realize that these people STILL feel bad about themselves right?  Your lie is quite obviously that - *a lie*. And people feel BAD when they\u2019ve been lied to. \n\nI\u2019ve read a few of your comments and all of them are concerning in one way or another. So here\u2019s what I\u2019ll tell you: I\u2019m a trauma therapist and I work with abused women on a daily basis. Based on what you\u2019re describing of your husbands \u201cgood qualities\u201d, he sounds *exactly* like my clients husbands. \n\nDo you understand what I\u2019m saying? \n\nI\u2019m not saying that his bad behaviours are red flags. I\u2019m saying that his \u201cgood\u201d ones are - the charm, the sweet words, the ability to \u201cconnect\u201d. Those qualities, *in combination* with his lack of empathy mean that something is deeply wrong with your husband. I\u2019m not saying he has a mental illness. I\u2019m saying he sounds abusive. \n\nPlease read \u201cWhy Does He Do That?\u201d By Lundy Bancroft. I suspect he\u2019s psychologically abusing and manipulating you, and you can\u2019t tell. That\u2019s understandable because it\u2019s subtle. But please just give that book a read. I\u2019m genuinely worried about your long term mental health if you don\u2019t take off those rose coloured glasses. \n\nAnd hey, maybe I\u2019m wrong. I can\u2019t tell much off your few snippets. But everything you\u2019ve written sounds like it could\u2019ve been written by my clients, and that\u2019s really concerning.", "What the fuck??? Calling someone out for their shitty behaviour doesn't make them \"inherently evil\", that's nonsensical.", "My partner is more introverted than me so I get asked where he is or why he\u2019s never around pretty often. I just say I don\u2019t know and remind them I\u2019m not his keeper or make a joke about him being a lone wolf. It\u2019s an annoying question to answer but it\u2019s better to keep it vague and remind them to ask him instead.", "Ah, you got suckered in by a charming narcissist. Unfortunate as those are the ones that get away with abuse the longest since it isn\u2019t as easily identifiable as an angry one who yells and hits you. Welp, one day you\u2019ll wake up hopefully.", "OP. I suggest you go back and read through your comments one after the other. Read what you\u2019ve actually written here today. This does not sound good. \n\n\u201cI have asked him to be honest with them but he just ends up making them feel bad\u201d?? HOLY SHIT. This does not sound like a kind or even decent person.", "My husband would do this for me, too. \n\nAnd he doesn't force me to lie for people.\n\nIs he your first partner?\n\nEvery good partner would do that for his spouse.\n\nHe even gaslight you to believe his caring for you would be something special.", "Oh so he's lovebombing older (maybe lonelier?) people, even better!\n\nWhy is his social circle about who YOU know? If I were you knowing he is like this I'd be limiting his contact with my friends/acquaintances. Let him find his own prey.", "Oh love. I would really recommend some therapy for yourself if you haven't already got access to that.", "I\u2019m like you in that I\u2019m very charismatic and people just seem to like me straight away. I also have bipolar disorder though and I find it extremely mentally exhausting and draining to keep up with friendships constantly. Because of this I probably have 3 real lifelong friends because they get it, they understand me and have grown up with me since we were teenagers. Making new friends is almost impossible because I can\u2019t keep up with the energy it takes to keep people happy.", "\u2018People feel good on first dates or first meets with me because I pretend to not have a personality and let them bare their soul to me\u2019\n\nThis sounds like intentional manipulation", "I disagree, if this woman is distraught enough to start crying, when it's already a little weird that she's texting and calling him often, she sounds like she needs to detach from her husband. \n\nI would find it really weird if I got busy and didn't reply for a few days and my new friend started crying over it and calling my partner to accuse them of gaslighting and manipulating me. \n\nShe sounds unhinged honestly", "I\u2019ve always found the most interesting people to be the ones other people dismiss as odd or weird. I myself am extremely boring, but as I am aware of that I am careful never to instigate conversations with people.", "Good to know there is a correlation like that! I suspect I might be on autism spectrum, I have difficulties with making friends, not understanding social cues very well and I had a \"friend\" I think was narcissist. \nInteresting.", "It is actual charm. Charm has a tendency to be fairly shallow a lot of the time. That's why it shares the connotation with being under a spell.\n\nWhat it's not is genuine charisma.", "This. I identify with this so much. And then they come to you for everything. And when you can\u2019t do it anymore you\u2019re the bad guy.", "Yes this is a big part of it too! Like my charisma is a facet of my personality but it\u2019s not my whole personality. I can\u2019t remain \u201con\u201d for an entire friendship.", "Nope. It\u2019s just finding out if the people you meet are sharing the same values. \n\nWhen the Orange turd was occupying the White House, I\u2019d bring him up in casual conversation and see how people react to him generally. If they\u2019d say anything favourable in regards to him I\u2019d drop them like hot shit. I got no time for associating with racists.", "My partner is extremely charming when he wants to be and it drives me nuts because he'll use it when I'm mad to get out of hot water. Works for us because I know exactly what he's doing and generally whatever I was mad about wasn't a big deal anyway, but it is wild too see how he can just turn it on. I think he could easily use it for evil if he wanted but fortunately he's essentially a big house cat.", "It reads as if you are the only one who really hasn't fallen for his charm attack. He is definitely narcissistic. He's collecting trophies of your friends and leaving you without them. Tell him your friends are off-limits. He gets to say hi, and leave the room. You are not his attention pimp. When people call after he dumps them, be honest, tell them he's a narcissist. Tell them he likes to make people fall for him, and when they do, that's what he was going for, so he doesn't need them anymore. Better yet, tell them before he does it, and then remind them you told them.  Tell the truth.", "Well, for now you acknowledge you are lying to your friend and others about your husband to \u201ccover up\u201d and thus deserving of some of the blame. Addressing that is a first step, then worry about unfair blame.", "Your husbands personality DISORDER***", "Ewwwww", "Definitely feel you on that. Socialising is exhausting. I can do it very well for short amounts of time but keeping it going for ages is draining.", "Anyone that is going to assume that, because Wren was such a great person and so personable, if he's now acting cold it must be because of a less-personable spouse. Especially if they can view that spouse as insecure or threatened.", "Hey, we must\u2019ve shared best friends! \n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear that was your experience too. It\u2019s bloody brutal isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m never letting her back in my life either.", "Oh you sweet angel. I'm sorry you are not picking up on his ques. His behavior is not normal, his extreme need for attention is not normal, alienating you from the few friends you have because of his behavior it's abuse. I hope you have someone to advocate for you as he is taking full advantage. You need to speak to a therapist, or at least a marriage counselor on what is and is not ok/normal/abuse. Please get help", "This sounds very hard. I\u2019m a bit worried about your situation honestly. The \u201ccharm \u2018em then drop \u2018em\u201d pattern is \u2026 disturbing. \n\nAre you happy in this relationship?"]}
