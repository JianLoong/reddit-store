He sounds like one of those in documentaries about people who are really good at acting socially and then getting bored of pretending they're a human with genuine emotions. Forgot the scientific term for it. He's an adult. He should take responsibility for getting so easily bored of people.", "Going out on a limb for ESH. Everyone seems to be overlooking the fact that Wren is kinda a jerk (yes convincing people you really like them, then getting bored and ignoring them is an asshole move, especially when you as his wife then have to meditate things and make excuses for him). \n\nYou should stop lying to people to protect Wren from consequences of his own dick behavior. It's not helping anyone. It's not that he's busy, it's that he does this every time and he deserves the fallout from that (which is going to blow back on you at some point as you're seeing). \n\nAnd it's weird that your friend was so distraught that your husband stopped taking her calls she started crying.", "ESH - you are a liar and a gaslighter. \n\nWhy are you doing his dirty work for him?

Just in general sense, you shouldn't have to regularly lie to cover up a spouse's... anything, but especially not a personality quirk that makes them treat other people badly. And to be clear, this *is* bad treatment. People aren't toys to use and discard. You say he's very good at making friends and making people feel special, but if he knows he's going to get bored with them and hurt them, why is he making that effort in the first place to draw them in? People are *lonely* and most are genuinely thrilled to make new friends.   \n\n\nYou're acting more like a PR manager than a spouse, and your spouse has a worrying lack of basic empathy for other people. Instead of making excuses for him, maybe it's time to take him to task a bit and ask him to try a bit harder to think of other people's feelings. His aren't the only feelings that matter, and he's going to end up isolating you if he hurts all your friends with his callousness.", "ESH\n\nI think this whole situation needs an injection of adult communication skills.\n\nIf Wren doesn't like someone & would prefer not to hang out with or talk to them, he should be able to put on his big boy pants & just say so, in a respectful way. I really hope he is at least willing & able to hang out with your friends in group settings with you?? If not, that's even worse..\n\nI also think the way you're handling this isn't okay. Telling a white lie in order to protect your SO can be okay, like if the other person has hurt them or something & they're not ready to address it. But this is your *friend*, and as far as your post goes, Alice hasn't done anything wrong. So I think she deserves better here. As it stands you're just covering for Wren's needless immaturity, & enabling it to continue. I would recommend speaking to him about his actions, that are forcing you into the middle of a situation that is *his* responsibility. Then politely tell Alice that she should direct her questions to him (assuming that he agrees to stop rudely ghosting people).\n\nImo Alice is kind of overreacting to the situation. It's not such a huge deal if her friend's partner doesn't really want to hang out one on one. Especially since ya'll have only become friends recently, it's a little weird to me that this has made her so intensely upset. That combined with the name calling & jumping to accusing you, has me raising an eyebrow, tbh.

People may love him, but that he drops everyone so completely makes him a bit of an ass, and it\u2019s ok that people figure that out.

Do you think the second option is a possibility? I\u2019m not trying to accuse him of crossing a line, but if he\u2019s the life of the party type person, it\u2019s easy for people to read further into it or assign it more meaning than it should. \n\nI think it\u2019d be worth talking to Wren about how he leaves people \u201cdistraught and confused and wondering what they did wrong\u201d, because this really isn\u2019t normal or healthy and he\u2019s the common factor. It\u2019s unfair that you have to deal with his trail of carelessness, and unfair that it interferes with your friendships. It\u2019s kind you stick by your husband, but can you ask him if you could tell Alice that this is just what he does? Would he be annoyed or feel betrayed if you just told the truth?

I don\u2019t like the culture of diagnosing strangers online, but giving him the benefit of the doubt, he might have some unresolved trauma that sees him chasing that high, while craving stability with you, and his love language could be needing reinforcement that you\u2019re as keen on him as ever and unlike his pattern of discarding people - you won\u2019t do that to him. Those can be common traits in people with severe abandonment issues - and him using their lashing out at you as proof they\u2019re \u201cevil\u201d is a part of reliving the severe abandonment cycle, only this time he leaves before he can be hurt and then assess how they respond to being abandoned and if they\u2019re \u201csafe\u201d to let in. \n\nIf none of that is an issue for him and doesn\u2019t need benefit of the doubt, then I\u2019d have to agree with others that he has a false personality and - maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve watched a lot of Criminal Minds lately - it\u2019s actually deeply concerning that he can manipulate people so easily and not care at all that he hurts them. Try to maintain your friendships and let the people you\u2019re close to know Wren does this to his friends so they can be mindful to not let you throw away all your connections and needs just to give your husband the time he says he needs. \n\nMaybe find an activity that the 2 of you can join other people in like a bowling team or something where you create a joint circle of friends where he\u2019s in a situation where he can\u2019t ghost these people because you\u2019ll see them every week and maybe some weekends for birthday celebrations.

It's a very conscious effort, because that stuff doesnt come naturally to me. And it can get exhausting. Honestly I try to make my social interactions positive for people partly because I know there won't be very many of them. I need a lot of alone time to relax and build up energy again, and it just feels like a chore to do all that song and dance for someone who doesn't really bring much to the table in terms of interesting conversation or what have you.

But by encouraging and discarding people on the level you describe, I would say that he is not a good person.", "It's not that we won't believe you, it's that it's irrelevant.

Like, you\u2019ve seen this man discard people so many times, even before you were married, you say he gets bored of EVERYONE at some point, but you aren\u2019t tortured by the likelihood  he will just get bored of YOU eventually? Also, he boned the neighbor girl. Her reaction is extremely Fatal Attraction. At the very least, he\u2019s an avid sexter, with her and probably with plenty others over time. He seemingly doesn\u2019t see people as human beings, but as toys.

As far as Wren is concerned, he has to be the centre of your attention, and everyone else in your own circle of family, friends or acquaintances.  Any new friendships you form, he has to take them over, drop them and when they approach you about it, you lie on his behalf to stop them either blaming themselves or you for being discarded.  Your parents prefer him to you, and you endorse that as your fault for not being very likeable or loveable.  Wren has eroded your self esteem to the extent that you are now co dependant on each other.  You enable his behaviour and steady the boat for him.  He is an emotional vampire sucking the life out of you, OP.  Even when you describe your finances, you mention you earn a little more, but as your hours are a bit longer that somehow evens it out, and makes your salary less worthy.  I recommend you have a look at the raisedbynarcissists sub reddit, as they have articles and links which help with this type of relationship, which is extremely unhealthy.
