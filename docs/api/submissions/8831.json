She was my mom\u2019s best friend growing up. My parents separated and, many years later, she took up with my dad. All parties were on \u2018good\u2019 terms.

Dad put up with her behavior because he had nowhere else to go and because he felt a sense of duty towards her.

She refuses to go home with her kids to grieve because she knows they won\u2019t allow her to drink. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t reached out to us at all even though I have sent a couple of texts to see if she is ok. She replied days later but only with how she was feeling. She sent a text to my sister asking why nobody is coming to see her.

Hun you need to grieve away from her abusive behavior. She is not yours to deal with. You aren't responsible for her, or her behaviors. Even if the worst possible thing happened to her it still wouldn't be on you. Deal with yourself and your pain, especially before trying to deal with anyone else.\n\nDon't let her turn you into her new source. She jumped from your mom to your dad, don't let her jump to you. She didn't give birth to you, she didn't treat you like a daughter as a kid or as an adult, so why would you put her mental health above yours? She wouldn't do the same, nor has she done the same. \n\nAs someone who recently lost a parent I can't tell you how sorry I am you're in this situation.

It might help you move on without involving other people that might, as you said, take advantage of your kindness.", "She can grieve with her own children.

Whether it's bc of her alcoholism or not, what you've described about your stepmother, she comes across as a controlling, abusive and very selfish. She didn't seem to truly love and care for your dad, and definitely not for you, your sister or your mom.\n\nFor every reason you've shared and the more you didn't, go with your gut instinct and stay away from her.  You have a good heart and that's why you feel guilty and don't wish to abandon her, so don't... keep texting her on occasion to check in with her, but don't put yourself into physical proximity of her, which includes phone calls. She can easily be as verbally abusive over the phone as she is in person.\n\nShe has kids and her own family, she's not grieving alone... unless her behavior has driven away all of her family too, and if so, that's even more reason for you to protect yourself from her, and just do a little to stay in distant and safe, text type contact only.\n\nI'm so sorry for you losing your dad.  \u2665\ufe0f", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What are you getting out of this relationship? It sounds like nothing but negativity for you except to soothe thoughts of obligation. Just because she was your dads partner doesn\u2019t mean you are responsible for her forever. \n\nThose feelings of guilt will fade but if you keep her in your life you will forever have whatever feelings she\u2019s giving you now. People rarely change, especially if this grief hasn\u2019t snapped her into caring about your feelings.", "NTA I guarantee you OP she hasn't thought once about you and how your grief and pain is hitting you, she wouldn't even care if she had.

You *don't* really have a relationship with this woman. She was married to you dad who was partly estranged. She wants to use you as emotional support animals or as a function of her grief.

She wasn't even a bad person, just much younger than my dad. My dad had a vasectomy before he left mom, so my siblings and I represented everything she couldn't have with my dad. She was nice enough, but not parental. Since we didn't have much of a relationship with dad, we had less with her (not completely her fault, she didn't want us around as much a dad was happy to use her as an excuse). The moment that set the bar for forward interaction with me specifically was when my aunt asked one of my brothers to look out for stepmom like dad wanted him to. My immediate response (and I'm a little ashamed, but it was at the wake and I was upset) was \"why does she need help? *Her* parents are standing right there, hugging her, alive, you know?\" \n\nPeople who are family to family are not yours.", "NTA.

It's starting to dawn on her that if my dad was to die, my brother and I aren't going to take her in. We're polite and respectful to her for our dad's sake, but we aren't going to assume ownership of her care.  She's already been kicked out of her own kid's houses. One put all her crap on the porch and changed the locks on her when she almost burned down the house with their newborn inside, so it was pretty final of a kickout. The other straight up moved out of his own apartment, didn't renew the lease, changed his number, and let the landlord evict her.

NTA.\n\nBut, it also sounds like you actually feel bad and want to help this woman even though you\u2019re afraid of what you\u2019ll get caught up in. That\u2019s awfully nice and you are in no way indebted to be there for her. I would say if you want to engage set limits up front. Tell her you\u2019re available for said block of time on said day and you won\u2019t condone alcohol. Stick to those limits and remember her problems and her grief are hers to come to terms with.", "You have been kind to her thus far, and deserve to be kind to yourself too.", "That\u2019s a perfect analysis and one I\u2019d never considered."]}
