He passed away at home of a cardiac arrest. \n\nNow a little back story. Dad\u2019s partner is someone that myself and my sister have known since childhood. She was my mom\u2019s best friend growing up. My parents separated and, many years later, she took up with my dad. All parties were on \u2018good\u2019 terms. Dad\u2019s partner never had any other friends apart from my mom and would demand her time constantly even though my mom really didn\u2019t want to hang out with her. \n\nDad\u2019s partner is a functioning alcoholic and drinks daily. Dad put up with her behavior because he had nowhere else to go and because he felt a sense of duty towards her. Their relationship became very toxic and co dependent and as a result my sister would refuse to have them round at her place for family events due to the fact she would always become drunk and nasty to both my dad and us. \n\nAs a result she tried to convince my dad that we didn\u2019t want to see him and that we were neglectful kids. She appeared to isolate dad from us and integrate him into her own kids family. \n\nWhen dad passed away, she didn\u2019t console us at all. My sister and I raced to their place once we heard and she was a screaming hysterical mess. We were in absolute shock. She refuses to go home with her kids to grieve because she knows they won\u2019t allow her to drink. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t reached out to us at all even though I have sent a couple of texts to see if she is ok. She replied days later but only with how she was feeling. She sent a text to my sister asking why nobody is coming to see her. My sister wants to wash her hands of her after the funeral and my mother does too but I just can\u2019t help feeling guilty that I am leaving her to grieve alone. Fundamentally I\u2019d love to have nothing more to do with her but she is in grief too. If we contact her to grieve together she will want to be around us all the time and we just don\u2019t have the strength to deal with her right now. If I don\u2019t contact her I\u2019ll feel like a terrible person but if I do then I\u2019m stuck with having to deal with her hysterical grieving style whilst I want to quietly mourn my dad\u2019s passing, and by doing so I\u2019ll giving her access to my mom too. \n\nTLDR, AITA for not wanting to comfort my grieving stepmom.", "created_utc": 1675233597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qmrph/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_my_stepmom/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hun you need to grieve away from her abusive behavior. She is not yours to deal with. You aren't responsible for her, or her behaviors. Even if the worst possible thing happened to her it still wouldn't be on you. Deal with yourself and your pain, especially before trying to deal with anyone else.\n\nDon't let her turn you into her new source. She jumped from your mom to your dad, don't let her jump to you. She didn't give birth to you, she didn't treat you like a daughter as a kid or as an adult, so why would you put her mental health above yours? She wouldn't do the same, nor has she done the same. \n\nAs someone who recently lost a parent I can't tell you how sorry I am you're in this situation. Honestly therapy is the only thing keeping me sane. Right now you take care of you.", "NTA. Do what's best for your own mourning. So sorry for your loss.", "NTA - you and your own well-being take priority. \n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t sound like she was close to you and she\u2019s toxic with a drinking problem. For your own piece of mind keep a distance.", "While it would be very generous and kind of you to reach out to your stepmom at this time, I don't think you're obligated to due to the way she has treated you. I'm very sorry for your loss.", "NTA \n\nBut I do think you might just feel lonely in your grief and you might feel like your stepmom might have stories to tell about your dad and that maybe those stories might help you move on quicker.\n\nI understand also the empathy you feel towards her, as toxic as she might\u2019ve been, she still loved your dad very much and needs help.\n\nThough I would recommend that you leave her to sort things out for herself, and maybe you should talk about this with a therapist instead. It might help you move on without involving other people that might, as you said, take advantage of your kindness.", "She can grieve with her own children. You don't need to hold her hand through this.\n\nNTA", "Omg NTA! Whether it's bc of her alcoholism or not, what you've described about your stepmother, she comes across as a controlling, abusive and very selfish. She didn't seem to truly love and care for your dad, and definitely not for you, your sister or your mom.\n\nFor every reason you've shared and the more you didn't, go with your gut instinct and stay away from her.  You have a good heart and that's why you feel guilty and don't wish to abandon her, so don't... keep texting her on occasion to check in with her, but don't put yourself into physical proximity of her, which includes phone calls. She can easily be as verbally abusive over the phone as she is in person.\n\nShe has kids and her own family, she's not grieving alone... unless her behavior has driven away all of her family too, and if so, that's even more reason for you to protect yourself from her, and just do a little to stay in distant and safe, text type contact only.\n\nI'm so sorry for you losing your dad.  \u2665\ufe0f", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So sorry you are dealing with this in your time of grief. Sending you condolences and please grieve the way you must, not what you think she expects.", "NTA. She\u2019s an alcoholic that your dad had a toxic relationship with. He only put up with her because he had no where else to go. She tried to turn your Dad against you, and would be nasty to you at family events. \n\nI mean, I could keep going but all I\u2019m doing is repeating your own words back to you.

She chose to alienate everyone including her own kids\n She is simply suffering the consequences of her actions\n Don't waste your time trying to support someone who doesn't care about anyone else.  She is so worried about others making sure she is OK,  but what has she done for others? Sounds like she is all 'me me me.' Mourn with your family and wash your hands clean of her, don't let her manipulate you while you're vulnerable", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like guilt is clouding your judgement. A relationship is two sided. What are you getting out of this relationship? It sounds like nothing but negativity for you except to soothe thoughts of obligation. Just because she was your dads partner doesn\u2019t mean you are responsible for her forever. \n\nThose feelings of guilt will fade but if you keep her in your life you will forever have whatever feelings she\u2019s giving you now. People rarely change, especially if this grief hasn\u2019t snapped her into caring about your feelings.", "NTA I guarantee you OP she hasn't thought once about you and how your grief and pain is hitting you, she wouldn't even care if she had.

Toxic. Alcoholic. Drunken crying. Victim. Ohhhhhhhhhhh. Nothing good will come of that", "Thankyou for this comment.

I'm sorry, but that's how it is for me. Feel free to ask the other kids their reasons, I don't speak for them.\"*\n\nIf she gets mad and freezes you out, that's a choice. If she hurts herself with alcohol, that's her choice too. \n\nYou have to learn to manage your grief your own way, in your own time. I'm sure your dad never meant to saddle you with a caretaking role for someone that you don't have much influence over, and who loves alcohol more than just about anything.\n\nCondolences on the loss of your father, OP. Oh, NTA.", "OP you are NTA and I say you do you and you do what is right for you in the time of mourning. I am so sorry for your loss"]}
