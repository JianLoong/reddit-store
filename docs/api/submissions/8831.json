You have a good heart and that's why you feel guilty and don't wish to abandon her, so don't... keep texting her on occasion to check in with her, but don't put yourself into physical proximity of her, which includes phone calls. She can easily be as verbally abusive over the phone as she is in person.\n\nShe has kids and her own family, she's not grieving alone... unless her behavior has driven away all of her family too, and if so, that's even more reason for you to protect yourself from her, and just do a little to stay in distant and safe, text type contact only.\n\nI'm so sorry for you losing your dad.  \u2665\ufe0f", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was nice enough, but not parental. Since we didn't have much of a relationship with dad, we had less with her (not completely her fault, she didn't want us around as much a dad was happy to use her as an excuse). The moment that set the bar for forward interaction with me specifically was when my aunt asked one of my brothers to look out for stepmom like dad wanted him to.

Part of the definition for one is the ability to maintain relationships. Step mom has only mainted her relationships because people have put up with her.\n\nShe's much worse then you realize. Step mom is vile. She doesn't deserve to be called a step mom.\n\nShe seemingly harassed your parents into a relationship with her. It sounds like your father was the one who wanted to continue it despite your mother being uncomfortable with it. Why would your father allow the relationship if it was clearly harming his wife?\n\nYou label her as a functioning alcoholic as a matter of fact. As someone whose parents remarried partner was also an alcoholic, I think it's possible that you've been desensitized to the severity of it because it's been accepted as a normal. Especially since it's gone on for so long.\n\nShe couldn't and can't live without a drink. She has to be drunk. She tried to isolate your father from his family and lied about his bio children. She refuses to go to her children because they won't allow her to drink. She's putting responsibility for her emotions on you and can't regulate herself.\n\nShe sounds like she could've been emotionally abusing your father. Abuse doesn't have to be physical. \n\nSometimes reframing can help recognize the situation. Take away step mom and dad. Put in son to keep the emotional attachment between you and the character put in gf instead of step mom.\n\nYour son's gf can't live without drinking or being drunk. She refuses to see family if they don't let her drink. Her emotions and moods are erratic. She seems to start fights and uses cruel language. She tried to isolate your son from his family so she could have him just for her own. She did this by lying.\n\nWould you allow this continue if this was your son? No. Because, in this context, it's clearly abuse.\n\nStepmom isn't a good person. She's not someone who deserves a relation. Her actions have most likely continued because it's been put up with. She shows 0 responsibility or accountability and was an abusive partner. \n\nAlcoholism can ruin someone like this, but it doesn't excuse it.\n\nYou know your situation better than I do, but\nI don't think you should have a relationship with her because she only seems capable of harming you.  \n\nThere's also a big red flag for your stepmoms personal health. \n\nYears of alcohol abuse don't just harm the liver. It can permanently damage how the brain functions. It can lead to early onset dementia because of the damage. Lack of emotional regulation is a symptom of how alcoholism can  harm a person in the short and long term.\n\nAfter years of use, the damage could be severe. The extent and/or the effect of it can only be determined by a doctor. Losing her husband could make your step mom display more dangerous behavior.\n\nShe needs medical help. It's not your responsibility to get it for her, but you need to weigh the possibility of her refusing to get it. Step mom could be consciously choosing to continue to hurt you and disregarding that she could deteriorate.", "NTA and she'll become an albatross around in your life.

Sometimes you have to look after number one, and in this case three, you, your mother and your sister.  Unfortunately your stepmother has been a toxic person in your lives for a long time, and the only reason you had a relationship with her at all was because she was with your father.  Now that he has passed, that reason has gone too. If a relationship with her would lead to access to your mother, who doesn\u2019t want to deal with her anymore, then don\u2019t. You\u2019re not a bad person for not wanting to deal with her, and it sounds like her own kids have set boundaries with her too.  You are not to blame for her many issues.
