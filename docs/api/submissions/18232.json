So you knew you might behave terribly at his party, but it\u2019s OK cause not too many people would be there to be bothered by your behavior? \n\nI\u2019ve known several adults who have autism whose behavior is just so rude and unpleasant that it\u2019s understandable that he wouldn\u2019t want his birthday disrupted that way. \n\nBut he handled this very poorly. Maybe try to have a talk with your brother about his specific concerns about your behavior.  If my behavior was extremely off putting to others I would rather be told so I can try to fix it.", "NTA. He can have whoever he wants at his birthday (even if his reasons are shitty) but lying to you about it is an AH move", "NTA. I would never talk to my brother again or go low contact if this ever happened.", "WTF???? If my brother chose not to invite me to his birthday party because of my autism, I'd be so hurt. What he did is awful. It's discriminatory and ableist as hell. I'm so sorry he did this to you.\n\nNTA.", "To settle everyone's concerns for your present health, I hope you make sure everyone who attended the party knows that you are -- and were -- in tip top health on the day of the party, and explain to them why you really weren't in attendance! Also I would take this opportunity to save yourself money by never buying your brother another present or card since he has shown you exactly what he thinks of you. You can also save your brother some money by returning any and all future cards and presents he may buy for you. I would also consider him to be persona non grata, and either ignore his existence or never attend another event that he will be at. But I'm particularly petty like that. You are obviously NTA. And sorry your jerk of a brother has done this to you.", "NTA. Your brother hates you.  I\u2019d go NC with him.", "They're not entitled to an invite simply because they're family though.", "He\u2019s an asshole, he lied repeatedly.", "I think if OP's brother has a problem with her autism because of past events, he should have talked to her about it, explaining his bday party would have loud music, loud noises and stuff that makes OP uncomfortable. Hope OP would realized that the best think was to decline the invitation.", "Yes, if the rest of the family was invited, OP should have been. That\u2019s a reasonable expectation. There is no angle in which OP could be the slightest bit of an asshole here (and I usually spend my time on this sub trying to find one, to troll). Could be y t a to self if they continue to allow the ableist brother to be in their life.", "So you should be forced to spend a lot of your own time, money, effort and \"spotlight\" at a special event intended for you catering and prioritizing someone else's needs? Wtf even is that, if brother LOVES strobe lights and thumping loud music and whatever that's his time and his day! He should have it!\n\nMaybe OP should be saying wow, I wanted to be there to celebrate HIS birthday with him, what can I do for him that makes sense for our relationship to show my appreciation for him? This all read so selfish and one sided from OP, about their experience, their perception, their exclusion with no acknowledgement of the why it happened.", "If that's how you REALLY feel then you tell them straight up.  To have a secret party and straight up lie is an asshole thing to do.", "Because he had to play the \"good brother\" and \"don't rock the boat, don't you see what you're doing to your sister!!\" role maybe? And maybe he just wanted to have a happy day that wasn't about her and catering to whatever the triggers are while also not wanting to deal with family pressure and shit?", "If OP still needs that conversation and an explanation of how birthdays work at 34 years old that's on them.", "At. The. Very. Least. If you\u2019re going to be ableist, be direct. Don\u2019t accept the birthday gift, lie to every person involved, or otherwise pretend to think of the person you\u2019re excluding as family.", "What the fuck? Why? Why are you assuming that? Being fussed by loud noises and socially awkward (which is all that the brother cited as being a problem) are not particularly distributive and embarrassing.

It's not \"hatred\" it's a case that there's a time and a better space to share and enjoy with the person who I do love and care about but has shown me time and again large parties are not that time and space. I set the same boundaries with my alcoholic brother in law too. \n\nWe have no framework other than the OPs laundry list of supposedly effective coping mechanisms.", "So you were reacting to this based on *your* experiences. You're making a lot of assumptions about OP that make me suspicious of any good faith on your part. Consider your experiences are not universal.", "NTA.  Your brother is. And he is being ableist.  He\u2019s blaming you because he got caught in a very stupid lie and is being hurtful as well.  This is not on you.  Of course, your brother can invite who he wants to his birthday party.  But he not only lied to you, he told your family you weren\u2019t there because you didn\u2019t feel well.  He knew what he was doing was a crap thing to do.  Your brother has shown you who he is.  Just know, this is on him, not you.", "NTAI wouldn\u2019t call it ableist as I would just excluding you. Look I don\u2019t like loud noises either. I\u2019m highly sensitive and hurt if someone\nexcludes me.\n\nIt was mean. But you bugging your brother will not make him change his mind.", "INFO- What shenanigans? What used to happen before you learned these new coping mechanisms that you seem to be saying have come along late enough in life that your brother isn't aware of them? Have there been incidents at some of his important life events? I'm sorry, but if you've been a lot in the past, and most of his previous birthdays have been all about accommodating you or dealing with the consequences of people putting you in an environment that through no fault of your own was totally inappropriate for you, I could understand him wanting one birthday to be about him. On the other hand if you've always just avoided big events, and been fine at smaller ones like this, or you weren't diagnosed until really late and he's not been anywhere with you since then to see how you cope now, he's being an epic A-hole.", "You are asking if you are an A H because you called your brother an ableist after he used your autism as an excuse to not invite you to his birthday party. I'm going to say NTA simply because he told you directly it's the reason why you weren't invited.\n\nDoes he have justification for his attitude? Maybe, but that's not the issue at hand. He lied to the family about you so he wouldn't appear to be ableist, got caught, and now is upset about it. Too bad. He's a grown man and while he can invite whomever he wants, he needs to be able to look people in the eye and tell them the truth about it.\n\nI've not been invited to events but was granted the respect of being told why. I also have not invited certain people and have granted the courtesy of stating the reason(s) why. There can be several reasons for your brother to behave this way, but none of them actually matter because the damage is done and now it's a matter of how you deal with it.\n\nSince he doesn't know of your coping strategies, I'm leaning towards he doesn't care about you enough to stay informed about you and your life. This is sad, but unfortunately common in families when at least one member has a disability. You obviously are close enough to him that when you visit, he opens the door instead of ignores you. Of course we don't know if this time was due to the present in your hand, or if he really cared. I'm honestly hoping he genuinely cares about you but is dealing with other things right now and you got caught up in it.\n\nMy suggestion is for you to do some soul searching and think of times when you may have acted out, or embarrassed him. Write him a heartfelt letter about those times, and how you may have handled those instances differently now that you're older and have more experience dealing with such things. Let him know that you'll be there for him should he need you, but you're stepping back as it appears he sees you as a frustration and you both need time and space. Go LC and let him have his moment to think on things, let him make the next move. When anyone asks, it's between you and him and ask them to respect that boundary. Carry on with your life, just without your brother in it for awhile.", "INFO: what are the \u2018shenanigans\u2019 that he is referring too not wanting to deal with?\n\nI ask because maybe he has some childhood trauma (any past \u2018shenanigans\u2019 that occurred around his birthday?) that he needs to work through which led him behaving like an AH.", "YTA for using the word ableist.", "NTA but your brother is.", "I'm sorry. This was cruel and yes \"ableist\".  \n\nWe don't get to choose our family and sometimes they are not kind people. This is about him as a person, not you.

Lying was ridiculous b/c ofc he was going to get caught.", "INFO:  you are conveniently ignoring answering questions about how behaviors connected to your autism have affected your brother and events in the past. Do you have a history of being disruptive and then having your support needs take attention away from your siblings, preventing them from ever having time that's really about them? \n\nBeing disabled sucks. Being the sibling of a disabled person also sucks, because few people care about your feelings or how your sibling's disability affects you, and you're often automatically assumed to be an ableist asshole if you grow up and get tired of having your whole life seem like it revolves around them.\n\nHe shouldn't have lied, which is why he's an AH. But depending on how your autism has manifested in his life, you might also be for jumping to ableism. The reality is that it's not a requirement for people to have you around if your behavior is unpleasant for them, no matter the cause. It sucks, I get that.

Alternatively he may be being a wretched bigoted twunt. Or maybe he's caring but human and wants to relax and not worry about every factor that might distress his sibling for once.
