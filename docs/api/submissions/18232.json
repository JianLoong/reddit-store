And it turns out that my brother had arranged a birthday party and everyone in our close family was invited as guests except for me. He had apparently told everyone that I was poorly and unfortunately couldn\u2019t make it.\n\nMy sister and I confronted him about it and he said that I wasn\u2019t invited because of my autism. He said I would just make a fuss at all the loud noises and I\u2019d embarrass him by being so socially awkward.\n\nWhen it comes to loud noises, I have ways of coping (e.g. ear plugs that make it quieter) and as for \u2018embarrassing him\u2019, the people there were literally our parents, our sister, two cousins, a couple of his friends and his girlfriend. \n\nThat makes a total of 8 people. It\u2019s not as if there were hundreds of people there.   \nI explained this and said that it was slightly ableist of him to disinvite me just because of my autism, to which he replied that I can\u2019t just go around calling everyone ableist because sometimes they don\u2019t want to deal with my shenanigans and it\u2019s selfish of me to force him.\n\nHe said that if I cared so much I should have told him about these coping mechanisms earlier (as in, when I didn\u2019t even know he was celebrating because he had lied to me) because I was just getting annoying pestering him - all I had said was ask him about why he lied to me, he said it\u2019s because of my autism and I explained what I did above.

You are supposedly his own blood sister, and he doesn't want you around to embarrass him.  Consider telling him there will never be another gift or another kind word from you for the rest of his life.  And he can one day explain to his kids about how his trash behavior brought this upon himself.  \n\nAdditionally, I would not go to any event that he would be at, and you should tell your siblings and parents of this.

Especially if their absence is being lied about (i.e., OP's brother lied to their family about why she wasn't there).", "This is why I asked for INFO. He's 6 years younger than her and presumably known her his whole life and has a firm understanding of her condition. For him to suddenly start not wanting her around is probably as a response to something she has done in the past, and not some spontaneous new hate for all people with autism.", "Yes, he\u2019s permitted to pick and choose who he wants to invite, but that doesn\u2019t give him license to do hurtful things. Just because someone has the RIGHT to do something doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s good or right to do.", "That's a wild overreaction.", "Yeah he doesnt have to but he lied to her and the whole family which is also legally not punishable but the question is not if people are doing legally okay stuff but if they are being assholes. And lying to your whole family and sibling instead of at least talking to said sibling about your issues is asshole-ish imo.", "Sure. \nHe should also have put on his big boy pants and not lied", "Yea but then brother became the biggest asshole by lying to the entire family about why OP wasn't there.

I mean, the latter is justified, more or less.\n\nEdit: I should add, the brother is an AH regardless, because the way he lied to the rest of the family about OP.", "Doesnt need to be. Some people refuse to believe in autism and accomodations. Maybe OP was diagnosed late in life so brother always thought she was weird and unsocial and annoying on purpose or just because and its OPs fault and they only \"recently\" got to know its autism and he refuses to change his tought pattern. Not unusual.", "Yeah it certainly is lol holy shit", "It\u2019s a birthday party, not a eulogy and she\u2019s already described multiple successful coping tactics so she\u2019s hardly violently causing a scene or harming/ upsetting anyone. \n  \n  Brother\u2019s primary problem seems to be embarrassment at her being \u201csocially awkward\u201d. He\u2019s not even had a conversation with her regarding coping noise in advance, he\u2019s lied to her and every other member of their family, deliberately to exclude her. He\u2019s an AH.", "I\u2019m just applying Occam\u2019s Razor, where the simplest explanation is probably the correct one. Did she do something at his previous birthdays that irked him, or did he spontaneously develop a disdain for her because of a very recent diagnosis? The latter, while possible, seems less plausible.", "His disdains is not because of a diagnosis. It is because OP  has syptoms of a disorder he does not want to deal with but he also does not want to be honest and does not want to talk about his problems with OP and sees OP as problematic. He probably always disliked her being that way and now doesnt wamt to deal with it anymore. That she has a diagnosis that explains her problems are not her being spiteful/malicious/just being that way because, that it was family, that he lied, that there could have been made accomodations or an honest talk, that all is why he is an ass. If there was no diagnosis he could have thought that she could change but does not want to. But he KNOWS that it is not her being mean or malicious, there is no reason not to ta\u00f6k about it.", "You're inferring and assuming quite a bit based on one post from one person's perspective. \n\nDo all autistic people get a pass for any behavior because they have no way of controlling it? Is there never a moment of inflection for someone with autism can think \"hey, maybe I shouldn't be doing this?\"\n\nAt any rate, all I asked is what happened at the last birthday party of he that she attended. That's a reasonable question."]}
