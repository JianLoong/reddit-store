{"id": 3781, "submission_id": "zat5qu", "title": "AITA for not wanting a baby around?", "selftext": "Recently my household moved into a new bigger  rental house. House hold consists of Me (f25), my husband (m23), my mother, and my brother. My mom got sick and had to move in with me and hubs 2 yrs ago. We are roommates and treat each other as such. This past summer I allowed my brother to come back to live with us when my mom got sicker. We needed a bigger space so we moved into a new rental. We all signed the lease . We all split the bills 4 ways so we are making it work. \n\nMy brother met a girl at work and they've been talking for 1 mo. We moved in about a mo ago. He has been talking to his gf for a month. The first weekend we moved in he had his new gf stay the whole weekend. We hadn't gotten anything unpacked, it was stressful really wasn't prepared to meet a brand new person in our new space.A few days later my bro (m30)asks me a question.\n He asked if I would be okay with his gf bringing her baby to spend the nights with him as well, bc\"I know you are taking medication to get pregnant\" At first I was taken a back. Hubs & i have been trying 2 years. I quickly said I would be uncomfortable with that, and that I am uncomfortable with having the baby in the house at all. He dropped it and went off. \n\nIt really bugged me especially the way he said it. I asked mom and hub if they were comfortable with having her baby over here, they werent either. It's not just about my fertility problems or bc they havent talked long, it's bc he has 4 kids that he is unable to see at this time and doesn't talk to.\n\nHe is upset because he feels he can do whatever he'd like since he pays his portion of bills. We did agree that she could spend the night, the only stipulations being the baby cannot be here or spend the night. The night before Thanksgiving I had just gotten home from the store when in walks brother,gf,and baby in hand. I was stunned. They walked past me and went into his room. \nThey stayed for about 45 mins, I started cooking things for the holiday and tried to ignore them. At one point gf and baby came out and walked around the kitchen while we were cooking and she was trying to make small talk before all 3 left for the weekend. It was an extremely uncomfortable situation.\nA few days later I felt I needed to express how I felt about the situation. I said I was upset that he made a deliberate choice to bring her baby inside after our agreement. He got defensive and said that's why he stayed out of the house all weekend, and how shitty it was that he was paying all these bills to not even stay in the house all because he can't have the baby over. \n\nI really don't know what to do. We are not trying to judge him, we just want to be comfortable in the space we all share and all pay for. It's not permanent, maybe just when we can all get to know each other better and get settled in our house. He is being pushy about this and tension in the house is sky high. It feels like he is trying to pin the blame on me, AITA?", "created_utc": 1670004876, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zat5qu/aita_for_not_wanting_a_baby_around/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds as if you're in for a rocky future with your brother living there. Good luck OP.", "NTA. The way it sounds like he thought he had some verbal ammunition with the whole \"I know you are taking medication to get pregnant\" is disrespectful. He's trying to manipulate the situation with the whole him staying away and having to pay for it still - those are his own choices.", "So your brother has 4 kids that he *checks notes* could give a shit less about, yet suddenly he is seeing this girl with a baby and wants to be involved to the point of fighting with family/housemates? Noooope. He needs a reality check and if that check is him moving out, welp, it is what it is. NTA.", "NTA. Three-quarters of the residents voted against the baby. Once he is 100% the resident, he can do what he likes.", "NTA - From what you are saying... there are 4 of you in this house. 3 of the 4 do not want a baby there. I dont see where his complaint is. If he has such an issue with it, he can move on his own.", "\"Her baby comes to stay\" and \"her baby is in the house for an hour while they drink coffee\" are different. It's reasonable to object to the baby moving in. It's not reasonable to say that the baby can't visit for 45 minutes.", "NTA.", "NTA. For certain things, all roommates need to be on board before the thing is allowed. This means even one roommate has veto power. Things like getting a pet, getting a new roommate, allowing a guest to stay over (especially for extended periods or multiple times), and such. Basically things that can affect the environment of the whole home. And having a baby come over is something that will affect all of you. \n\nSure, your brother is paying some of the bills, but that does not give him free reign to do whatever he wants at the place. And there is a *big* difference between bringing someone else\u2019s baby overnight and someone who lives there trying to start a family. \n\nAnd, I\u2019ve got to wonder, considering how your brother ambushed you with this, how long it would be before he and his GF wound up pressuring you to babysit so they could have some \u201cquality time.\u201d", "NTA - You went into the house with one expectation of the living arrangement which your brother tried to up end in pretty short order. Yes he pays his share of the bills but the GF isn't.", "NTA you moved in together with out a baby in the equation and you, your husband and mother all have said they don\u2019t want a baby in the house. In any household majority wins. Your brother should look into getting an apartment with his gf and her baby", "NTA- just because you pay rent somewhere doesn't mean you can do whatever, whenever you want especially when you have roommates. Your husband, yourself and your mother all outvote brother and said no to the baby being at the house. He chose to ignore your wishes and brought the baby over anyways. \n\nNo offence but I think you made a terrible mistake letting your brother live with you. He has 4 of his own kids at 30 that he never communicates with?? Clearly he is not responsible, caring or a good decision maker so why would be be any help to your sick mother?", "NTA.  *He* pays the bills.  His girlfriend wasn\u2019t part of that deal.  You wouldn\u2019t necessarily have agreed to let him move in if you knew that actually meant accommodating *three* extra people, one of whom cannot be asked to keep it down.  Make sure you get on the same page with your husband (or not; I think I just assumed this was *his* brother since I can\u2019t figure out why else you\u2019ve just been going along with it) about this not working and him needing to find somewhere else if he\u2019s looking to move in with her, because it\u2019s not working and he needs to find somewhere else.", "NTA- and honestly if the relationship is this new, I don't think that bringing the baby around is a good idea because even at that age, kids get attached. It's too new for them to be considering a life together (unless they were friends for a long, long time before becoming a couple, and even then it's iffy.) Plus the adults could get attached and then if she or he decide they're done, baby is suddenly ripped out of your lives, leaving a lot of broken hearts.  \nBrother likely needs to find a new place to stay with gf if he feels this adamant about it, however, I still feel it's way too early in the relationship for that kind of commitment. Brother also needs to apologize for bringing up your fertility problems to try and manipulate you into doing what he wants.", "NTA\n\nNew girl, not his kid, four kids he doesn't even participate in raising. Nope. And a horribly disgusting comment about your fertility issues as well.\n\nWhat would be the cost to break the lease?", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing if the girl comes by for a half hour here or there with the baby but quite another to bring a baby into the house all the time (especially spending the night). 3/4 people feel uncomfortable with it and I think it\u2019s reasonable to want to put a stop to it now before it starts becoming a regular thing. If he doesn\u2019t like it then he should make plans to move out. When you live with multiple other people you can\u2019t always do whatever you want when you want just because you are paying part of the rent. There has to be compromise and consideration for how your actions effect others. For example, I live with multiple other people as well. In an ideal world I\u2019d be able to play music super loudly as late as I want, take 1+ hour long showers whenever I want at all hours, have company over being loud whenever I want, walk around half naked if I wanted, and I\u2019d have 1-2 cats. I can\u2019t do any of that because it would negatively effect my housemates. Does it suck? Sure, but it comes with the territory of sharing a living space with people.", "Info: Do you  and your parents have to get approval from him for your visitors? I don't mean overnight guests necessarily, because this \"no girlfriend's baby\" seems to apply even if they just  wanted to stop by for an afternoon.", "Soft YTA. Sorry about the issues you are facing, but that shouldn't be a reason to not be around a baby. As long as they are not rude and have bad manners, he should be allowed to have his GF and baby over. Talk it out about how many times a week it is allowed. So, it's not every night.", "YTA So when you have a baby you will be moving out? So that nobody else has to suffer through living with a baby?\n\nGet a grip. The baby was over for 45 minutes. Not the whole weekend. And your brother does have an equal say in the house rules if he is paying his way.", "Soft YTA - he\u2019s paying bills and it\u2019s his place too.  If he wants to bring guests over, he is certainly entitled to do that.  If he was a guest just til he gets back on his feet, sure set the rules, but it\u2019s his house too, not just yours to  make whatever rules you feel like.", "ESH. \n\nIf he pays he should be able to bring whatever company over that he wants, within reason. If it\u2019s crying all night okay, maybe, but then it could still be there during the day. He lives there and has a right to use the space too. \n\nYou both need to compromise on something reasonable.", "I am gonna say soft YTA. He pays his bills he is allowed to have whoever he wants over, including a baby. Unless your lease states otherwise you need to get over it. That being said that baby should not be staying over night. If the baby/ mother is spending too much time there then he needs to pay more rent or find a new place to live.", "> We did agree that she could spend the night, the only stipulations being the baby cannot be here or spend the night.\n\nSo if your brother wants to spend the night in his own bed with his own girlfriend, they have to dump the baby off somewhere else for a night?\n\nI dunno man, this whole thing feels strange.  It's a little weird for bro to have someone over the first weekend y'all are moving in but it doesn't sound like they got in the way or tried to push any boundaries.  I have to assume there's more backstory with the brother that explains why everyone's so angry about the mere concept of briefly seeing a baby.", "YTA.\nHe pays part of the rent so he can have guest over. Those include children.\nI could understand if she was ther all the time but like you said 45 minutes...\n\nSoo either except that the Baby will be over some times or pay his rent.", "YTA. He pays equal bills to you and that is his home. I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t like it if he decided what visitors you could have.", "Sorry, YTA.\n\nIf he's paying his share, excluding her baby is ridiculous if she's also visiting.\n\nYour personal fertility struggles are certainly valid, but not right to punish someone else's kid.\n\nAnd yes, if that's your \"rule\", he should move out and stop paying bills where he's not welcome.", "YTA. I can understand not wanting to share your space with a baby but if you are sharing with someone, they are allowed to have guests...even babies. If you want help with mom, you need to be more flexible.", "Because he pays equally in the bills, and his name is on the lease \n\nYTA\n\nYou don't get to dictate what he does in his home.

I needed help with the bills and taking mom to appointments. He was homeless at the time so it seemed like a good mutual deal, he could get a job and get on his feet and help with some bills. Well, we all got on our feet and mom started feeling better, we agreed we needed a bigger place and we would all love together for 1 more year before we all split up.

Because if so, I think you should do it. There's something creepy about the meds comment, like the dude is monitoring your private sex life. Add to it he's trying to get on some new girl's good side by using her kid against you all, when it appears he can't be trusted with children.", "OP that sounds ideal for you, maybe he should terminate his spot and go live with the new gf/baby. Having roommates is hard, and having one roommate act bratty and entitled is the worst.", "Not in tenants rights. \nYour argument would alow that they agree to beat him up...", "Is he your roommate or your tenant?\n\nIf he's your roommate, he gets to make reasonable decisions about how to live in his house, just as you do. You need to work it out, but you can't just give a blanket no to him never having visitors just because you don't like the visitor. He gets some say in who he brings in to his living space, as long as it's not creating a dangerous situation.  \n\nIf he's your tenant, then you might have more say, but still, I'm saying YTA if you won't let him have visitors just because you don't like them.", "Then that would be a problem, but unless that actually happens you are just make assumptions and doing what you want without consideration for EVERYONE that live there. I can understand new people being around can be annoying, but that doesn\u2019t mean you get to dictate how other people feel. Does he pay rent? Is it in the lease that you are the only person who gets to decide who is welcome into the apartment? Do you have a roommate agreement that state no guest or anything like that? If not unfortunately you need to move on.", "How long until you get settled? If you have a definite timeframe, that might be reasonable, but as it is YTA.", "Also, I think it is reasonable to be uncomfortable with having a baby we don't know spend overnights. This is an infant. 5 mos I believe.", "I feel like u not  tellin us what he did to the other 4 kids his OWN kids is what is scaring me and if that lady baby is in danger someone needs to tell her im on the fence with this since i dont have a view of the full picture", "You seem very defensive about people\u2019s opinions even though you asked people to weigh in. Something to think about.", "Yeah but like I said. He pays equal in bills and rent, so he's not a tenant it's his house too. You can't just gloss over that fact", "He is suddenly short sided. Everything has been going really well until he met a girl, which I get. But now he's lost all sense of consideration for other housemates.", "Unattended? OP says the mom was holding the baby. That\u2019s the exact opposite of unattended", "Right, gf was holding baby trying to chat with me and mom, after we all had Convo about no baby for now.", "The child was attended.", "As a legal tenant, I have every right to walk around naked and fuck my husband on the couch. Should I? I pay my fair share of bills, I don't care if it makes my mom and brother uncomfortable", "Why does it have to be on your time frame though? Who made you the decision maker for everything related to the apartment. He shouldn\u2019t be making unilateral decision either.", "Yep been kicking myself for falling for it all over again", "We can afford it. But, as everyone has stated, he is a legal tenant and on the lease, I can't force him to do anything.", "I never said he could not have guests, we all have a right to.

(Which, to be fair, she seems to be *trying* to fix that, but the lack of self-awareness that should maybe have happened *before* she started coming around this much either means your brother\u2019s been giving her a *very* misleading idea of the setup, or a whole lot more boundaries are about to get crossed.)", "Overnight is different than an hour long visit.", "His ex wife has a restraining order on him. He can contact the kids via phone, but doesn't.", "Sure no I can't gloss over that fact, but just because I pay bills does that mean I can lounge around naked, even if it makes the other housemates uncomfortable? I pay my fair share of bills, I have a right for my bare titties to be flopping around despite how other people feel.", "I have a friend that does that, whenever he meets a girl. Annoying AF.", "He has FOUR kids he can't talk to and NOW he's being short-sighted??", "You make very weird comparisons.\nAlso having sex in front if other people that don't want it is actually illegal.", "I take care of the business. We voted on that. I took the loan to get the rental, I found the place, I take care of all the bills of the house, am the one who is in contact with the landlord and so on. I am trusted to take care of the operations of the home.", "Frankly I don't want to. I want everyone to respect one another and let the dust settle for a bit. That's what I want. Either way, it'll work out.", "I think this is fair. I also think it\u2019s fair for roommates to have agreed upon boundaries for:\n\n- the number of guests\n- the frequency of guests\n- guests staying the night\n- even specific guests\n\nOf course it\u2019s much better to agree upon those boundaries before the move happens. But everyone lives there and should be comfortable in their own home.\n\nThat said, if your brother is a dead beat dad, with 4 kids he can\u2019t see, and a frequent change of girlfriends, I wouldn\u2019t want the baby around either (I\u2019d be worried I\u2019d get attached!).", "I feel the exact same. He is trying to force feed us all of this and we just need some time to adjust.", "Yep you're right. Are you missing the part where all 4 of us sat down and agreed that for now we aren't comfortable with baby being in the house.", "NTA. OP does his new gf know about the restraining order from his ex and lack of correspondence with his other kids? Why not just randomly start talking about it to her one day? Hey it\u2019s YOUR apartment too and that means you can talk about literally anything you want! Lol I would get petty that way but that\u2019s just me.", "Alright, say one day I invite my father over to visit. I don't tell bro. Bro is very uncomfortable around my father, and I know this. I bring my father in on purpose, full well knowing it will upset my bro. I do it anyway, bc I pay bills and I don't care about how he feels about my father. \n\nBecause I have knowingly made him upset, I now cause tension in the house that could have been avoided. I could have given him a heads up or asked to have the house empty for a few hours. Instead I was inconsiderate, and now everyone is upset.", "Again just because you are a responsibly person doesn\u2019t mean you get to decided who people have over as guest. I do mean guest, if the baby or mother is staying so much that the seem to live there then by all means interject. Does he get a say in who you have in the house?", "That is exactly it. You hit the nail on the head. I will not live 1 year uncomfortable just because 1 housemate is doing whatever the fuck he wants to", "I didn't. I think that was unreasonable too.", "Honestly I have nooo idea what she does and does not know.", "If he had asked you to be out of the house at that time, would you have left?", "Your argument is flawed. You don't have a  problem with this baby. You don't want any babys. \nSooo no man over 55 that fatherd a child would be comparable. \nAnd if for sake of argument that baby personaly wronged you may have a case..", "We all sat down and had a discussion and he agreed to not having the baby over for now. Again, we run by guests coming over by everyone in the house.", "Yes, we would have left had we had enough notice. There was none. The other day he asked for private house time with the baby and we were all  agreeable to that.", "I'm really confused by this comment. Please elaborate further.", "Overnight I understand, but 45 minutes when most of the time it was spent in HIS room that he pays rent for, you don\u2019t get to make that decision.", "So if brother picked out one of your friends, for any reason or no reason, & said that person should never be allowed inside the home, you would abide by that? How about if he picked out a few or several of your friends or your parents\u2019 friends & said they couldn\u2019t come over? Would you all abide by his wishes?", "Based on your description, you actually saw the baby for, what, a couple of minutes? If they were all in his room for the rest of the time I am baked as to why that's a problem.", "In your example he would dilike it if a specific person visits you. It sounds as if he feals wronged about this one person. \n\nYou don't want a group of people, babys, in your house because it makes you uncomfortable.\n\nToo go to the most extrem case of an example, in that I don't want to imply that you are a racist, this is just to make this more clear. \nI don't want black people in my house that makes me uncomfortable.\n\nThats just not a valid reason.", "I'm not trying to make decisions for him, I am asking him to be respectful of how others feel. I", "Hmm, 1. I never said never. I said for now, the other housemates are uncomfortable with the baby in the house. We would like to get acclimated to the new house and their relationship first.", "They were in and out of his room, I stayed in my own bedroom for about 20 minutes because I was having a borderline anxiety attack. Then i came out and started cooking because I had to, and because my dogs were very anxious and barking.", "Yet you aren\u2019t showing him that same kindness"]}
