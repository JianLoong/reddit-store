Our friend group started organising his birthday and outing to the strip club.\n\n\nI asked my wife if it was okey that I was going with the guys to the club. She was fine with it. I suspected she was fine with it, but wanted to ask to be sure. I assured her I would only watch and not get a lapdance. \n\n\nMy wife and I have been married for 2 years, before that we were in a relationship for 3 years. \n\n\nMy friends had selected a good club and told us all to take more cash than usual, because this club was expensive. I wanted to know a more exact amount, because I had never been to a strip club before.\n\n\nWe went to the club and it was fine. The guys, and more importantly, Josh had a great time. Halfway through I realised I was going through my cash a bit fast, and the guys explained I should tip less, and spread it out over a greater amount of time. We still tipped well. We all also pooled cash to pay for a couple of lapdances for Josh. Some guys also had some. \n\n\nIn the end, I thought it was fine, but between the overpriced drinks, loud music and overall vibe, I realised strip clubs aren\u2019t for me. \n\n\nI went home and told my wife. When I mentioned the name of the club, she went from shocked to really angry. She didn\u2019t want me going to this club. Eventually, I realised this was the club she used to work at (as a stripper). I knew she was a stripper before our relationship, but she never told me much about it, preferring not to talk about it. Over the years I got some information, but not much.\n\n\nI don\u2019t really care though, it was in her past and she wouldn\u2019t do it again. \nMy wife never mentioned the name of the club she worked at, and I never told her the name of the club we went to. Maybe that\u2019s were I fucked up, but I thought, a strip club is a strip club. \n\n\nTurned out my wife is angry because I saw where she worked. And probably saw some old co-workers that are still her friends. I never met these friends (nor saw pictures). Only heard some vague stories, so I didn\u2019t know who they were.

There was no way for you to know.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is wrong for expecting you to have to read her mind. It's awesome you asked her and wanted to be transparent - that's how healthy relationships should be.\n\nMaybe you going there brought up some stuff for her, and this is why she's reacting that way. That's not your fault.", "I feel like this is a NTA situation.  Your wife has a problem with that specific club, but I can't see how she'd expect you to know that without communicating.\n\nI get where she's coming from, but she probably should have specified which clubs were off limits beforehand.", "NTA.

Even if she had told you where she used to work, she never told you she doesn\u2019t want you to go there, so how were you supposed to know that either?", "It's a bit weird how you told this whole story saying your wife was OK with you going to a strip club, and then dropped in the twist that she used to be a stripper. NTA though, she could have just said please don't go to that specific one.", "Please inform your wife you are not a mind reader and I'm unsure how your should have known better.  You told her you were going to one, if she was that concerned about which one in particular, she could have just asked.  She is being silly. NTA", "So she's angry that you didn't read her mind. Just you wait she'll be real pissed when you don't invent a time machine.", "NTA- wife is mad for? you didn\u2019t know where she worked, co workers etc. Would have been different if she specifically asked you not to go but she didn\u2019t. You were super respectful about it too, good on you.", "NTA - she had to know there was a chance they'd chose that one and if that was her only hang up, she could have made that clear at any point *before* you got back.", "NTA. I mean, how were you to know that\u2019s the club she worked at? At first I thought you cheated and I was gonna write YTA but then the reason she got mad was not because you went to a strip club but because you went to a club she used to work at and did not tell you the name of!", "NTA. You asked for permission and she agreed. You had no way of knowing what club she worked at or that she would be upset if you went to said club. She should have asked where you were going in this case.", ">She says I should have known better.\n\nThis doesn't even make sense. You literally did not know.\n\nNTA", "NTA how on earth were you supposed to know which club she was at??", "NTA. Your wife should have known better. You asked for a veto. You did not get one.

She did not.", "NTA. You maybe should've mentioned the club if you knew she was a performer previously. She also should've had enough awareness to ask. But you did what you could to clear it, and she said yes. This is unfortunate, but nobody is really at fault. \n\nShe's probably angry and hurt because she didn't want that part of her life to be known to you in this kind of detail. It's understandable. It also can't be changed now. It may take some time, but she will probably calm down, and you two can move on (maybe a debrief is helpful, maybe not). I'd suggest in the meantime avoiding similar things, just so you don't trigger her again. \n\nHang in there for the short term, she may want to take the initiative in any \"talk\" you have about this. If things are still tense after some days, maybe try to sit down with her and just clear the air.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t ask where you were going to assure you weren\u2019t going to her old job, and never wanted to tell you details about it. It\u2019s okay to feel temporarily awkward or bad about it but it\u2019s not asshole level stuff and her anger at you is very misplaced.", "NTA. She sounds embarrassed.", "NTA. How were you supposed to know she used to work there if she doesn\u2019t talk about it? There\u2019s probably more she\u2019s not telling you if she\u2019s that upset", "How should you have\"known better\"?

She knew you were going to a strip club and it didn't occur to her to say \"I don't have a problem with it but I don't want you to go to X because that's where I worked and I'd be uncomfortable with that.\"  You're not a mind reader!  The problem is hers.\n\nNTA obviously.", "NTA, you arent psychic. If she was concerned about not wanting you to see her old place of work she should have asked the name of the club in the first place when you asked if it was alright to go", "NTA. How should you know better if she's always been closed about her past in this regard? When you asked permission she should have asked which club if it were such a concern. Still just apologize and move on with your life, this is not the hill to die on.", "She sounds like she's embarrassed. NTA. Tell her you aren't going back and that if she really wanted you to avoid her old club, she should have told you the name before.", "NTA.  She didn't say \"No, you can't go\" (you asked, so props to you).  She didn't say \"it's OK for you to go, but not to THIS PARTICULAR CLUB\" sp you had no way of knowing.  She really has no cause to be angry and I'm sure she'll realize that at some point.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s caught off guard and embarrassed. You communicated and behaved yourself, so I can\u2019t see what you did wrong. You even said they\u2019re not for you so there\u2019s no risk of you making a thing of it. I\u2019m the same way about strip clubs, good one the girls for making money and I guess the guys for having a place to have fun, but it\u2019s not my thing, I feel incredibly awkward about the whole thing.", "NTA -- her reaction is bizarre, especially given that she is a former stripper. I'd ask her to be more specific about why she didn't want you to go there. Then inform her you can't read her mind.", "NTA- but why didn\u2019t she ask? That\u2019s weird.", "She should\u2019ve known better. When she let you go to a club, your wife should\u2019ve ask \u201cWhich club?\u201d. Instead she\u2019s practically blaming herself for not asking more about, and is taking the blame on you.  Therefore you are NTA.", "NTA. This was just a really unfortunate coincidence. Based on your tone and how you didn\u2019t even mention that your wife was a stripper until halfway through the post, I can tell that you\u2019re completely fine with your wife\u2019s past. There is no way you could have \u201cknown better\u201d as you\u2019re not a mind reader and clearly aren\u2019t concerned with her former career.", "NTA but this story sounds weird. \n\nFirst, why would you specify your friends said to \u201cbring more money than usual\u201d if you\u2019ve never been to a strip club before? Why not just say you had to bring a lot of money and be done with it? Strange unnecessary detail. \n\nAlso, why on earth would your wife say it\u2019s ok for you to go to a strip club and then later get pissed when the reveal is that she used to be a stripper?\n\nThe fact that you withheld her prior status as a stripper almost seems like a scripted reveal\u2026 you definitely buried the lead by holding that piece of info until when you revealed she got upset. \n\nThis story seems fake. Or like it\u2019s not actually being told by the person who lived the experience.", "NTA\n\nYour wife either can't explain or doesn't want to acknowledge why she is feeling the way she is and wants something to blame. \n\nI think the best you can hope is to just let it go and that she does as well.", "NTA, your wife was probably doing more than stripping, and knows that's what goes down at that particular joint.", "NTA\nIf she was going to be so selective about where you wanted to go, she should\u2019ve told you.", "What is there to know better? can you read her mind and know that she worked there in the past without her actually telling you?  How were you to know, you didn't even choose the venue your friends did so how is this your fault? To top all this off, you don't plan on going there by yourself are you?  Let her be mad and when she is done, sit down and talk about it. Tell her that Guys can't read minds and if you didn't know that this would affect her in this way . If she would have told you about it you never would have gone or asked to change the venue.\n\nNTA all the way.", "NTA. How were you supposed to have known better if she never told you the name of the club?", "NTA. I can understand her being upset and not realizing she would be until after the fact, but she needs to put her big girl panties on and handle her feelings, not blame you for not knowing about it, especially when you gave her ample opportunity to share what she wanted you to know.", "NTA\n\nIf she had a problem specifically with you going to her ex-club then it's on her to mention it to you, \"if you're going to X then don't go\". She didn't tell you where she worked, or that she didn't want you seeing where she had worked, so how were you supposed to read her mind?", "NTA....  You were upfront with her with all the information you knew... She's the one that withheld information about her past from you... Frankly her secrecy over her past is a big red flag. You two need to have a serious \"tell all\" discussion about her background because it does matter... the situation you just found yourself in proves that it matters.", "NTA. How, exactly, are you supposed to \"know better\" if you didn't even know where she'd previously worked? She's being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou told her what was going on and she was fine with it until she found out that you unknowingly went to one that she decided was off limits without ever telling you about it.\n\nThis is a huge red flag, there is something very likely something she's hiding in relation to this that is making her mad.\n\nThe \"you should've known better\" thing is a huge cop out that is almost never as justified as the person saying it seems to think; people are not mind readers.", "NTA.", "NTA. You asked if it was okay and she said yes. You're not a mind reader, if there was a club she didnt want you to go to, she should have been upfront with that.", "NTA. You had NO idea where she worked at. This sounds exhausting. Good lord.", "NTA. She should have said ok but please don\u2019t go to \u201cX\u201d club if she still has internalized hang ups about that place.", "NTA. You both knew she had a past, and if she was that concerned, she should\u2019ve asked for the clubs name, or said \u201cas long as you don\u2019t go to X\u201d \n\nBut railroading you after the fact (and her still keeping in touch with her stripper friends!) is a a red flag.", "Obviously NTA you\u2019re not psychic, how were you supposed to know to avoid that specific club if she didn\u2019t mention the name or ask where you were going when you got permission to go", " NTA she should have told you how she felt, and at the very least asked which one, if she was concerned.", "NTA.\n\nIf she had a strong feeling about where you went, SHE should have said \u201cI\u2019m okay with you going to a strip club, as long as it\u2019s not (place of work) because (reasons)\u201d I have no idea how you were supposed to know this otherwise.", "NTA\n\nIf she had a problem with you going to a specific club, she should have told you that when you asked.", "Could be n ta, but I decided to be positive, so NAH.\n\nShe seems to have some unresolved issues with her past, and I understand why that can makes her not wanting to tell you in details about it, but if she has some boundaries for you to respect about it, she still has to communicate them to you.\n\nAs for you... You asked her beforehand, and you were transparent about the whole thing. \"You should have known better\" is just nonsense since she never told you the boundaries about it.\n\nNow, could you have tell her the name of the place in advance? Yes, but in your minde \"a strip club is a strip club\" because you have no past about it, and that makes total sense! And at the same time, she didn't ask about it neither, while in her case \"a strip club isn't a strip club\" for at least one strip club.\n\nAll in all, you both need a calmer conversation to discuss things over, without accusation.", "Considering you knew she use to be a dancer, yes, it would\u2019ve been smart to tell her which club it was, but like you said, you two never got in depth when you talked about it. I want to say NAH because your wife is allowed to have what feelings she has, but when she said \u201cyou should\u2019ve known better\u201d, that makes her the AH and you NTA because she *also* could\u2019ve ask which one you were going to.\n\nEdit: added clarification because others think I was trying to put all the responsibility on OP.", "INFO: Did you just say you are going to a club? Or did you specifically say Strip-Club? \n\nIf you were clear about going to a strip club NTA, she should have been more specific in terms of what place she \u201callows\u201d for you to go or not go.", "You couldn\u2019t of known Better", "NTA -  If your wife wanted to make sure you didn't go to the place she previously worked, then as soon as you mentioned you were going to a strip club, she should have asked you which one you were going to. \n\nHave you reminded her that she doesn't really talk about that time in her life, and that she had never told you the name of the club where she had worked? \n\nI really don't understand what it is she thinks you \"should have known.\"\n\nUnless this isn't about having gone to her old club at all - but that you actually went to a strip club, period. The \" should have known better\" may have been about her wanting you to not want to go to any strip-club, because of internalized shame she may hold over herself due to the decisions she made during that time of her life. This is only speculation, though, since you haven't really shared much about what you may know on her current mindset relative to stripping/strip clubs, in general.", "NTA\n\nPersonally I think you did everything you could short of reading her mind - trick I haven\u2019t figured out yet. \n\nIt seems to me that she is upset about something else still and choosing to fixate on \u201cyou should have known better.\u201d I am not a psychologist or FBI interrogator, but my personal experiences point to her being worried about something else happening and covering it up by being angry at you. Maybe she thinks you\u2019re judging her (even though you said you aren\u2019t and you didn\u2019t even disparage the club), maybe she\u2019s worried you\u2019re judging her based off of some of the friends who still work there (even though you said you aren\u2019t), or maybe she\u2019s afraid someone said something to one of your friends that may open up a can of worms for her later. I dunno. \n\nAll I can see, as an outsider, and by no means an expert, is that she\u2019s expecting you to know something you couldn\u2019t have known and seems upset still despite your reassurances. It\u2019s definitely worth re-reassuring her. Not sure if that would make it worse, but at least you\u2019re showing her you\u2019re trying. When my wife gets mad at me for not reading her mind, I give her time to cool off and then let her know that I\u2019m sorry but I wasn\u2019t trying to upset her and ask what I can do in the future so we can avoid this. \n\nClearly that club is a live wire for her so either you figure out why or you figure out how far away you need to keep from it. What would be the compromise you guys can settle on: Never mention that club again? Never go to any strip club again? Never even mention the phrase strip club? Who knows. Good luck", "What\u2019s the chance that she still works there?", "The best part is you would have continued not knowing where she worked or what her former coworkers looked like if she didn\u2019t get unjustifiably angry. How silly of her", "NTA. She agreed to let you go and you had no way of knowing which club she worked at if she failed to volunteer that information.", "NTA. She should have said hey don't go there beforehand.", "NTA but you are a rube. Don\u2019t let her yank you around. She has no right to be angry and make sure she knows it as you calmly stand your ground. You\u2019ve kept all promises, kept her informed, and were being a good man. If she is too insecure about her own past, she can kick rocks. She needs to grow up", "NTA, but y\u2019all suck at communicating and if ya don\u2019t figure that out you\u2019ll continue to have this pointless problems.", "NAH, it really feels like she\u2019s lashing out because she never expected you to see her past. Now assuming this outright would probably be a bad idea, but you should try to talk with her with an accepting mind to see where the problem is. And to reinforce to her that it hasn\u2019t changed your view of her and that you love her for her. \n\nBut I could be way off here, so take it with a grain of salt.", "NTA. With her past being what it is and knowing that she\u2019s only fed you limited information Allen\u2019s also knows that you\u2019ve never been to a strip club, she should\u2019ve asked for more information. That way she could express her feelings of being uncomfortable or maybe even given you advice on everything.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t, so now she needs to get her tassels out of a tizzy.", "NTA.

How can you know to avoid a certain place if she\u2019s never told you to avoid a certain place?", "NTA. You asked, she was fine with it and really any other conditions are on her to volunteer.

The knowledge imbalance between the two of you in the subject of 'how to behave in a strip-club and reassure your wife when you go to one' suggests she should have chipped in if she had any issues. \n\nSo no, you shouldn't have known better. She sounds like she's feeling pretty guilty about something though, which seems out of place if it was so long ago. If you've never even met some of these people who are still friends, that starts to make her reaction look a little like a red flag. Maybe she is just ashamed of her time there, but maybe there's more you don't know.", "NTA\n\nit sounds like your wife is ashamed of having been a stripper/still has some hang-ups about that part of her life, and is feeling weird about her two \u201cworlds\u201d colliding.\n\nthat being said, that\u2019s her own problem to solve. it has nothing to do with you and it\u2019s not fair for her to lash out at you for it.", "NTA, but you should be more thoughtful.about WHY that club is an issue.

I suspected she was fine with it, but wanted to ask to be sure. I assured her I would only watch and not get a lapdance. \n\n\nMy wife and I have been married for 2 years, before that we were in a relationship for 3 years. \n\n\nMy friends had selected a good club and told us all to take more cash than usual, because this club was expensive. I wanted to know a more exact amount, because I had never been to a strip club before.\n\n\nWe went to the club and it was fine. The guys, and more importantly, Josh had a great time.

I myself was emotionally repressed and through therapy have learned to experience and work through my emotions. \n\nThe classic example of this is only displaying limited emotions. For me, these emotions were happiness and anger. Whenever I felt a positive emotion, my brain interpreted it as happiness. So I didn't really differentuate between gratitude, encouraged, contentment, excitement, accepted, and so on. This is in and of itself not bad. But with negative emotions, it can get dicey. Any time I felt alone, sad, embarrassed, afraid, or some other negative emotion, I processed it as anger. This led to weird reactions to things. And since I'm not feeling the emotional response I'm having, I can't process and let go of it.\n\nSo I'm saying all of this to point out that your wife may have been feeling anxious or embarrassed about you seeing where she used to work, but processed these emotions as anger. But it is also equally likely that she knows of shady dealings or practices (that she didn't necessarily participate in, but just was aware of) going on there and worried that you may have indulged (I'm thinking prostitution or drugs or whatever).\n\nIdk, I'm not a psychologist and this is single example with very little context, so I could be totally wrong, but something about your story of her reminded me of me.", "NTA.

Normal human beings talk to one another and don't infantalize their partners", "u/Jazzlike-Baseball-73: \"I'm not sexist\"\n\nalso u/Jazzlike-Baseball-73: \"She's a woman-they always change their mind.\"", "Nice blatant misogyny/sexism bro !", "POV; you\u2019ve never spoken to a woman", "Dude.  \n\nDo you KNOW any women?  Like, in real life?", "You claim it has nothing to do with the post. The post is whether he is an AH. Well he is ashamed of the wife's past quite clearly, but has no problems going to her old haunts. The attitude of \"oh it's okay, she'll never go back to that\" is gross to be honest.", "Nah. Just like you wouldn't want your wife to go have dinner with an ex. Same principle. I could trust my wife without having to put or be put in compromising situations.", "Yeah. Let's not make this about you. You and hubby, do you. This guy clearly knew boundaries and tested.", "Yep except he knew about her past. He should've treaded more lightly. And yes it is sooooo the point of the post- he's married and **he should've known better.** It's time for him to grow up. Why get married if you're still about that single life? Stay single and go to all the strip clubs in the world.", "I'm sure you are happily married. \n\nCheers!", "I know your mom", "Not wanting to be married to a stripper is a fine boundary to have, even if you went to a friends birthday at a strip club. Only thing gross is your IQ.", "not wanting your wife to be all over other dudes for a living is a healthy boundary, not gross.", "the post is not asking if he\u2019s an asshole, it\u2019s asking if he\u2019s *an asshole in this specific situation*. just because someone is an asshole in general doesn\u2019t automatically make everything they do asshole behavior. so while you might think he\u2019s gross in general, it\u2019s not pertinent to the issue at hand.", "He clearly knew the boundary of she was okay with it, due to asking...", "Honestly, my relationship is the absolute best part of my life. She's everything to me and a fucking one in a million partner. So yeah I'm fucking ecstatic lol.", "Then you know that she's not shy about telling you exactly what she thinks, at length, probably in greater detail than you need or want to know.", "Yeah. Let's hope he learned his lesson and not ask stupid stuff anymore. I bet anything she'll one up him now and pull something bc he opened that door. Text book.", "That's great to hear. Thank you for sharing.\n\nAsk her if you could go to the strip club tonight. Test it out...your relationship;)", "Oh sick burn."]}
