You are right to be upset with him moving away and not coming back until the holidays again.  He is definitely TAH for doing that AND not seeming to take an interest the rest of the year.  So your frustration is completely justified, but you stated you held some resentment.  Could that resentment be getting in the way of working out some reasonable arrangement that allows the child to see their father and not stay with him in a hotel room?  If so I think you should reevaluate for the sake of the child.  Don't put yourself in the position of  preventing your ex from seeing the kid.

He is basically a stranger, and it would be better to have others around so your child is comfortable. He could come over and play,  do an activity (like a craft) and bring presents. (You can offer suggestions) With your help, it could be a successful visit. Or, you could not help, or sabotage it, and it flops. (Kid cries, or is scared, or it\u2019s awkward) and maybe he will go away and not come back. So basically it\u2019s up to you. I can understand how upset you are at him moving away, and I don\u2019t get that either! So I would say NTA. He has made this awkward. If he stayed local and had regular visitation, it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Maybe he regrets moving away? Is he going to just do a yearly visit? I\u2019d want to know that. Reappearing and disappearing isn\u2019t good for your child either.", "NTA - You said it much better than I could. No notes.", "I thought the same thing when I heard \"hotel\".", "He's the Father. He has a legal right to have access to his child. He doesn't have to earn shit! That's why there are laws to prevent AH like you from withholding visitation cause you're bitter. Wow!", "Since he lives half way across the country, he seems to be a \u201cit\u2019s this or nothing\u201d mentality.  He wasn\u2019t keen on other times when I tried to work that out with him. He hasn\u2019t offered any other solutions, despite me trying to discuss that with him.", "It\u2019s almost like if he can\u2019t see him when he wants, then he\u2019s not coming. I\u2019ve tried to suggest alternatives or see when else is convenient. School is not an issue, our child is still a toddler and I don\u2019t mind pulling our child from daycare if he visits. He lives half way across the country, so popping over for a few hours is a lot.", ">Could that resentment be getting in the way of working out some reasonable arrangement that allows the child to see their father and not stay with him in a hotel room?\n\n\nSo after about 2 years, this man comes to play dad for a child that seems young enough to not know him much anymore and it will be fine with YOU? \n\nOp did not say he couldn't see his son/father.she is saying that their Christmas plans will not be scrapped because daddy suddenly wants to come around. \n\nAnd a hotel? That is how you will want your child to spend the holidays? \n\nAnd funny how you spent these paragraphs defending a deadbeat and looking for loopholes on the PRESENT parent.", "I have not barred him completely, just apparently only the only 3 days that he seems to want to visit/ willing to visit. Likely, because he has no where else to spend the holidays. There\u2019s 365 days in a year, he has another 362 to chose from.", ">You are being petty, assuming hes lonely when maybe he just wants to be a better father\n\n\nYou are so right! \nWonder though if Op chooses to leave their child in maybe a foster care and move to the other side of the country...and then she can come back after over 2 years to check on their child when she's lonely... \n\nWould be so sweet, right?", "According to OP she has and the Father has refused. He wants Christmas or nothing.", "He hasn't seen him for a YEAR and wants to swoop in  and have the kid for Christmas. Nope, fuck that. He can see them another time.\n\nETA: Yes, he has been gone a year! His kid is little and doesn't even know him, so yes, he needs to earn it!", "maybe he shouldn't have effectively abandoned his child then. he doesn't get to show up and confuse this poor kid. she's bitter because her ex is practically a deadbeat. he has a legal right, sure, but hasn't seen his kid in a year...", "They had split custody and he left.\nIf he wants to see his kid again he can either earn it by regaining their trust or he can go to court.\nShe has absolutely no obligation to let him see his kid.", "He\u2019s a pretty shitty father if he hasn\u2019t seen his kid in a year.", "Well sounds like it's nothing then.  Does he at least pay child support?", "It sounds like he wants to hijack Christmas. He's taking a high point in the kid's life and taking it over; he is fucking with your life. Refuse to let him near during the holidays, and absolutely do not let him take your child anywhere.", "Fair question, but no. I have done everything possible, even driving our toddler half way across the country summer 22\u2019 to my ex so he could spend a few weeks with our child..

That makes perfect sense.\n\nI did not make the suggestion of the child staying in a hotel.

He is definitely TAH for doing that AND not seeming to take an interest the rest of the year. So your frustration is completely justified, but you stated you held some resentment\n\nI never defended the ex and stated he's TAH for what he's doing.  If OP's ex ever takes her to court to try to amend the custody agreement and he can show that she actively prevented him from seeing his child it may not go over well for her.  However, she could still let him see the child for Christmas without the child staying at his hotel room and not have it completely upend her Christmas plans from the sound of it, and not provide him any ammo if he tries later to make claims against her of parental alienation.", "Wow. According to OP. A father doesn't have to earn anything to access his child under the law.  IT'S THE LAW! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "According to OP. Or he can go to court. Exactly why the statement of 'reasonable visitation ' means it's all OPs control and she's a bitter ass. So FU all! Fr.", "You don't know the circumstances because this is reddit. Armchair lawyer your headcannon", "Thank you!!!!!! Parental Alienation! WTF is wrong with you people?  If I was his friend I would tell him to immediately lawyer up and get it done through the court. Guess what after that you got no say whatsoever. Still the AH! JFC people. Fuck father's I guess? And then cry about it later on reddit. SMH", "Okay and the law decided that SHE gets to decide when he can visit. It\u2019s like that for a reason.", "I'm not sure the court would find his request as 'reasonable'. Shows up out of the blue after abandoning his child and requests visitation on on of the biggest holidays of the year. That's not reasonable.\n\nHe's been told he can have him any other day. OP is not being unreasonable. Nor is she denying him access to his son.", "OP has driven the child across the country to visit his father. Telling the Dad you can't have the son on 3 days of the whole year is not parental alienation. Where are you getting these ideas from?"]}
