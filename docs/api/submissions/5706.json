I knew my partner wanted to keep spending low in order to save for an engagement ring, so I wasn't expecting a lot of presents, just the one big gift. So imagine my surprise when I see a bunch of presents for me under the tree for me, including the obvious stand mixer shaped box. There were a couple rare vinyls (we're collectors) both cost around $50, a Lego set that I wanted that was around $100. I was really touched my partner was still breaking their budget to give me more than one gift. \n\nSo I moved on to the last gift, fully expecting to see that familiar KitchenAid logo only to unwrap the worst stand mixer money could buy.  Probably cost around $35-40. Which pretty much the rest my partner's original budget. as soon as I saw it my heart sank. Not only was it not a KitchenAid, it wasn't even really a stand mixer, just a hand mixer with a stand and a bowl. I tried to put on a happy face but it was plain to see I was deeply disappointed. \n\nMy partner had looked so excited till they saw my reaction. I asked if we could return it and I would pay the difference for the one that I wanted. I know that hurt my partner's feelings, but I kind of felt betrayed, like the rug had been pulled out from under me. We returned it today and my partner said that they would pay the whole thing, which made me feel worse since I knew they had a budget and this would blow way past it. So, even though they keep saying I'm not a jerk for being upset by it, I really feel like I am. AITA for being so spoiled?\n\nEdit: I just want to mention that we both have decent jobs and aren't broke. The stand mixer we were looking at when I said I wanted one was a KitchenAid for $250 which was under the budget $300. So this wasn't some extravagant purchase.", "created_utc": 1672079967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvtlma/aita_for_being_ungrateful_for_my_christmas_gift/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also know that what he got you definitely doesn't do the same thing. He easily could've bought the one thing you really wanted and asked for vs all these extras.  So you're definitely not wrong for being upset.\nHowever the only reason I'm saying NAH here is some people just don't get that and have been conditioned to give lots of things. I'd definitely talk to your partner if this is a habit so you understand each other's gift giving preferences especially if you plan on spending the rest of your life with the person.", "INFO: How much direction was given on the stand mixer? Was a certain brand name given, make, model? How much does partner know about stand mixers? I only say that because I can definitely see how this was a well-meaning but misinformed purchase. I absolutely adore my KitchenAid stand mixer, so I definitely empathize that a hand mixer with bells and whistles really is just not the same. BUT, I don\u2019t think your partner was screwing it up either.", "INFO: Did you ask for that specific KitchenAid mixer? Explaining why that was the one you wanted?", "NTA Sounds like you and your partner are in a good place. It was just a miscommunication. No need to make it a bigger deal than it is.", "NAH, but in future just know to give specific brands if it's important (and make it clear you prefer one 'quality' present over multiples) - people who aren't into a certain hobby just don't know the difference it makes. Or agree to only give each other token gifts, and buy yourself exactly what you want instead.", "NTA.   -   Had you actually explained the difference in stand mixers.  That you wanted a particular brand?  Cause it sounds like he really thought he was giving you what he wanted.  This will be something to laugh about in years to come.", "NTA. But start being more specific to your bf in the future about what you want to help avoid this situation.", "I think NTA, but it was a honest mistake that your partner made. People who don\u2019t cook don\u2019t understand the magic of a KitchenAid stand mixer or why the cost of it is totally worth it. My mom got hers off the wedding registry and it still works perfectly 20 years later.", "NTA - my KitchenAid was $235.  I also would never consider an alternative stand mixer.", "NAH\n\nThis is just an opportunity for better communication. When you really want a specific item, speak up and provide the specific details and don't expect your partner to read your mind or assume that because you were looking at a specific brand that it registered with him that that was the actual brand you wanted. Personally, I hate cooking. If my partner asked for a stand mixer, I really would have no idea where to begin or how to tell which one was better quality or had more bells and whistles.", "NTA\n\nThe important part is: they thought they were giving you what you wanted. \n\nIt's not, and that's ok, and being honest is a big part of a healthy relationship.", "NTA.  Kitchenaid is the go to mixer and will last many many years.  A high quality mixer is important.  I'm guessing your partner knows nothing about mixers which is why he went with the cheap one.  Giving a cheap mixer instead of the kitchenaid is like giving someone a bicycle pump when they need a pump for their car tires.", ">I kind of felt betrayed, like the rug had been pulled out from under me.\n\nThis seems...a little extreme. I don't know...I mean, I think you can want something, but to put this much emotion into hoping for a gift seems too much.\n\nAlso...\n\n>I was really touched my partner was still breaking their budget to give me more than one gift.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou seem so attached to how much money they're spending on you. Can't you value that they put thought into giving you something without obsessing over the price tag?\n\nYTA", "NTA you\u2019re allowed to have feelings and hate the gift that was given to you, I\u2019m sure your partner isn\u2019t sensitive and will understand that the present was trash", "NTA, although feeling betrayed and like the rug was pulled from under you is overly dramatic and a fine line towards being an asshole. But I bet your bf does not know anything about mixers, went to buy one and saw a lot cheaper option, went with it and bought you the other gifts, thinking he was doing a great job. So now he has learned about mixers and you have learned that your partner is awesome for not wanting to take back the other gifts to buy you that mixer you really wanted.", "You cannot beat the quality of a KitchenAid. I use mine at least weekly, probably more. Don\u2019t settle lol", "Yeah YTA. A kitchenAid goes for 500-1000$ min easy (im european so not sure how it translates) and he already spend at least 200$ on other gifts on top of an engagement ring? If you want this to be a long lasting relationship, then maybe don\u2019t pressure him to go into debt for you. You expect him to cough up what.. like 5k on presents/jewellery for you, and you have given him what exactly?", "NAH -- Navigating gift giving is an important. Your partner put effort into the gifts while you had your heart set on one specific item. May this experience bring about more communication on gift expectation, absolute 'wants', compromises...example:  couples exchange gifts and on black Friday they buy the 'one thing' they absolutely want if it was not gifted.  My uncle is a generous gift giver and we all knew he'd shop within  a week for an item(s) if he did not receive what he wanted.  Best to you. Love and loving acts show up in many ways.", "Yeah, YTA. This is why you shouldn't go into a gift-giving situation expecting a specific gift. I find that a little tacky anyways, tbh. No one is betraying you by giving you gifts. Maybe he wanted to choose something for you or maybe he wanted to give you things that have personalized value. Like, yeah, I could have gotten my dad something he'd like for his lawn mower or whatever, but I wanted to give him something special because gifts are supposed to be special. Not mail-order. I would feel really insulted if he looked at the novella I chose for him and sought out because I thought it spoke to things important to both of us and said, \"Why didn't you get me a new hat? I wanted a hat.\"", "YTA. You know you hurt your partners feelings but *you* feel betrayed? You sound extremely entitled.", "YTA. You went in this fully knowing he couldn\u2019t afford to get you a kitchen aid. You got your own hopes up and it bit you in the ass. You should have accepted the gift and then saved up to get the kitchen aid yourself after a couple months. Congrats on making your partner feel like shit for not having as much money as you clearly expect him to", "Very mild YTA, a present is a gift not a transaction. If you really wanted that item, you can purchase it yourself", "YTA - your partner is trying to spend low and save money *for an engagement ring for you* and you asked for a Christmas gift between $500 and $1000. \n\nIF you specifically told him you wanted a kitchen aid, would say n-a-h except you let him spend the money to get you a kitchen aid after everything else. definitely YTA.", "YTA I've taught my children that the only appropriate reaction to a gift, no matter what it is, is an enthusiastic THANK YOU! What do you do if you get a gift that is the exact thing you already have? Say THANK YOU! What do you do if you get a gift you don't like? Say THANK YOU! What do you do if you get a big pile of poopies? Say THANK YOU! Nobody owes you your dream gift. If you want to return it later, approach that conversation gently later, not the moment you open the present.", "NAH. Next time, be more specific!", "NAH but this is why I'm against asking for appliances for Christmas. It's reasonable to want a particular item, but unless he agreed to buy *that* model for you its a gamble.\n\nSome people will buy you something they still see as good", "YTA. This whole post comes across as so spoiled. I bet your partner was willing to pay for the whole mixer because he\u2019s rethinking that engagement ring now.", "YTA\n\nNot a giant one, just a little immature.  It would have been better to be thankful and not say anything in the moment.  Next day, you can exchange it for what you want or start saving for one.  Kitchenaid stand mixers start at $350 minimum.   It is nice to have both kinds of mixers depending on your need.", "YTA for expecting anything and ungrateful. He\u2019s saving to buy you something else. There\u2019s no reason why you couldn\u2019t be grateful for what you got, used it for a while and replace it with the Kitchenaid in the future", "Yta.\n\nGift are suppose to be gift, not something to be guilt of.\nHe gave you 3/4 gifts, not only One and wrong.\n\nNext time, buy yourself what you want if it's so important.\nMaybe he have a reason to buy that thing, settings, reviews?", "YTA - you don't get to dictate what a gift is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The one we were looking at when I said I wanted one was $250.", "I agree, it\u2019s taken my husband years to understand that quality is more appreciated than quantity when it comes to gifts. I would much rather have one gift that I\u2019m still using the following year then a bunch of things collecting dust just so I have to open Christmas morning.", "Finally someone with sense", "I don't think they were intentionally screwing it up either. My partner is the biggest sweetheart and really thought I'd be super happy. I don't think they really understood just how much difference in quality there was. I didn't specify KitchenAid, but we were looking at KitchenAids when I said I said that I want a nice stand mixer.", "We were looking at KitchenAids when I said the only thing I wanted was a nice stand mixer.", "Thanks for that.", "Agreed. No worries here. He took a shot and missed. I think you can push a little harder on making up the difference if you don't want him to dip into his ring savings. NAH.", "Yeah, my partner is pretty much over it now that they've seen all the things KitchenAids can do.", "We were looking at the exact one I wanted when I asked for it.", "My mom also got hers for her wedding. It's been 40 years now and it still works as good as ever. I've been wanting one since the day I moved away from home.", "Yes, my number one take away has been that people have wild ideas about what KitchenAids cost.", "Op. YTA. You didn't specify. He got what you asked for to the best of his abilities. For someone that fancies themselves as a cook, you should know better than to ask for anything kitchen related without being explicit about what you want and reiterating that nothing else is acceptable. 235 for some of us is high to put up for a mixer. Especially one like op's so bought is cheap and does a good enough job for the infrequency most of us use one. I've seen no significant difference with kitchen aid products other than having many fail prematurely.", "Lol I can understand why it would be difficult when you have no idea about cooking and baking. We were looking at a specific KitchenAid when I said I wanted one. My partner didn't understand that there was a difference between a KitchenAid and a plain stand mixer. I grew up seeing a KitchenAid in every home, so it never really occurred to me that not everyone knows what makes them different.", "We have a healthy relationship. Despite what some here think, this will have zero effect on the strength of our bond. I'm sure it will just be a funny story later on.", "Yeah, now that they've seen the difference between the two things they're really excited about getting more attachments. First one, cheese grater. Lol", "What are you even saying people look forward for presents on the holiday season. Stop gaslighting the OP for not liking a gift", "After seeing what the KitchenAid does, they definitely see the difference in quality.", "Yeah, I was definitely being a bit dramatic there. But I know there was nothing but good intentions from my partner. Now that I have shown them the difference, they're excited about all the attachments and things we can do with it.", "Yeah, a lot of people really don't know what the difference is between a KitchenAid and a hand mixer on a stand. That's like saying \"we have beyblades at home\" and at home there's a dreidel. (I don't know why I thought of this metaphor, I've never owned either xD)", "FYI, if OP is in the US, a KitchenAid mixer goes from about $250 for a base line model if you catch a sale and $500 for the high end.  It\u2019s about $350 when not on sale (Target has one on sale for $250 right now).  So the BF spent $200 on OP with the other gifts.  Another $50 for just the mixer is not a stretch, if he was listening.\n\nAlso, I get really wanting the mixer.  Told the family this year that if anything happened to my kitchen, it\u2019s the first thing I would replace after large appliances.  My husband bought me a new one a couple years ago (I really wanted a red one and we found a deeply discounted one for cheap). My son is now taking my 25+ year old one because it still works.  These things last forever and I use mine all the time.  I get the disappointment.", "I don't know where you're getting these numbers from. Lowest KitchenAid goes for like $250-300. There is no going broke or into debt here. We both have decent paying jobs and live below our means. I spent around $1200 on their presents. So I think you're assuming too much.", "Well the kitchen aid isn\u2019t what the person wanted so the partner wasted money", "Where on earth are you getting 5k from? You know an engagement ring doesn't have to cost $4000 right?", "That's a pretty good idea. We'll do that next year!", "Fair enough, this has pretty much been what has been making me feel the most like a jerk.", "I agree. The audacity of OP. Of course, she's allowed not to like the gift but cheese and crackers. How she went about it blows my mind how people are saying shes not the AH. Maybe one day OP will learn to be grateful.", "I said I would pay for the difference myself, I didn't expect them to pay the whole amount.", "Well if he couldn\u2019t afford just say I can\u2019t get a gift for you this year why waste money on something the OP doesn\u2019t want.", "You're right.", "The KitchenAid we were looking at when I asked for one was $250, which was under budget", "How is she the asshole for wanting an engagement ring. if an engagement ring is expensive for  the bf how the hell are they gonna have children someday or possibly grow their lives together. A simple engagement ring isn\u2019t to much to ask for stop gaslighting her she\u2019s not NTA.", "Well I feel like it would be okay to protest a bit if you get a pile of poop, unless you're a farmer. But yeah, you're right about the rest. I feel like such an ass.", "I do feel like I was being spoiled. But your reaction is a bit extreme. It's not like this is a regular occurrence.", "How she didn\u2019t like the gift that was given to her the person gave a shit gift", "We did exchange it today, I was going to pay the difference but my partner insisted. But I know they just did it because they felt guilty.", "How is she a giant asshole for saying she didn\u2019t want the kitchen aid which is extremely cheap and useless. if the partner couldn\u2019t afford the gift OP wanted, they could\u2019ve communicated that and said they couldn\u2019t afford it why waste money?", "Wtf world do you live in where it's not extremely normal to ask for specific gifts?", "Gotcha. I really think this is a \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d situation. Gift giving can be tricky business sometimes, especially when purchasing for someone else\u2019s special interests\u2026it can be hard to nail it if you don\u2019t have similar interests. I think this is a pretty mild YTA so I would definitely sit down, express where the reaction came from, and apologize. You\u2019ll both be OK, but sometimes when we have something very specific in mind we need to either get it for ourselves or give the absolute clearest and easiest path to success.", "I think it's one of these things that you kinda need to let the dust settle a bit and maybe explain in terms that'll click more with him - that it's like asking for Lego and getting Sticklebricks. May also be required to reinforce it's not a big deal if it's a first 'offence'.", "Also, I think it's hard for someone who doesn't cook to understand the magic of a KitchenAid mixer. I mean, I could put rocks in there and make gravel.\n\nI love my KitchenAid mixer and would accept no substitute, so I really understand your emotions. However I understand that people who don't cook regularly, or do the type of cooking that would require a stand mixer, cannot understand why it's so magical to people who do use one.", "Don\u2019t listen to the petiole saying the YTA but I think this is a sign that your bf is poor.", "Yeah, that\u2019s what I thought.
