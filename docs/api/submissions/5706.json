I knew my partner wanted to keep spending low in order to save for an engagement ring, so I wasn't expecting a lot of presents, just the one big gift. So imagine my surprise when I see a bunch of presents for me under the tree for me, including the obvious stand mixer shaped box. There were a couple rare vinyls (we're collectors) both cost around $50, a Lego set that I wanted that was around $100. I was really touched my partner was still breaking their budget to give me more than one gift. \n\nSo I moved on to the last gift, fully expecting to see that familiar KitchenAid logo only to unwrap the worst stand mixer money could buy.  Probably cost around $35-40. Which pretty much the rest my partner's original budget. as soon as I saw it my heart sank. Not only was it not a KitchenAid, it wasn't even really a stand mixer, just a hand mixer with a stand and a bowl. I tried to put on a happy face but it was plain to see I was deeply disappointed. \n\nMy partner had looked so excited till they saw my reaction. I asked if we could return it and I would pay the difference for the one that I wanted. I know that hurt my partner's feelings, but I kind of felt betrayed, like the rug had been pulled out from under me. We returned it today and my partner said that they would pay the whole thing, which made me feel worse since I knew they had a budget and this would blow way past it. So, even though they keep saying I'm not a jerk for being upset by it, I really feel like I am. AITA for being so spoiled?\n\nEdit: I just want to mention that we both have decent jobs and aren't broke. The stand mixer we were looking at when I said I wanted one was a KitchenAid for $250 which was under the budget $300.

I also know that what he got you definitely doesn't do the same thing. He easily could've bought the one thing you really wanted and asked for vs all these extras.  So you're definitely not wrong for being upset.\nHowever the only reason I'm saying NAH here is some people just don't get that and have been conditioned to give lots of things. I'd definitely talk to your partner if this is a habit so you understand each other's gift giving preferences especially if you plan on spending the rest of your life with the person.", "INFO: How much direction was given on the stand mixer? Was a certain brand name given, make, model? How much does partner know about stand mixers? I only say that because I can definitely see how this was a well-meaning but misinformed purchase.

No need to make it a bigger deal than it is.", "NAH, but in future just know to give specific brands if it's important (and make it clear you prefer one 'quality' present over multiples) - people who aren't into a certain hobby just don't know the difference it makes. Or agree to only give each other token gifts, and buy yourself exactly what you want instead.", "NTA.   -   Had you actually explained the difference in stand mixers.  That you wanted a particular brand?  Cause it sounds like he really thought he was giving you what he wanted.  This will be something to laugh about in years to come.", "NTA. But start being more specific to your bf in the future about what you want to help avoid this situation.", "I think NTA, but it was a honest mistake that your partner made. People who don\u2019t cook don\u2019t understand the magic of a KitchenAid stand mixer or why the cost of it is totally worth it.

I also would never consider an alternative stand mixer.", "NAH\n\nThis is just an opportunity for better communication. When you really want a specific item, speak up and provide the specific details and don't expect your partner to read your mind or assume that because you were looking at a specific brand that it registered with him that that was the actual brand you wanted. Personally, I hate cooking. If my partner asked for a stand mixer, I really would have no idea where to begin or how to tell which one was better quality or had more bells and whistles.", "NTA\n\nThe important part is: they thought they were giving you what you wanted. \n\nIt's not, and that's ok, and being honest is a big part of a healthy relationship.", "NTA.  Kitchenaid is the go to mixer and will last many many years.  A high quality mixer is important.  I'm guessing your partner knows nothing about mixers which is why he went with the cheap one.  Giving a cheap mixer instead of the kitchenaid is like giving someone a bicycle pump when they need a pump for their car tires.", ">I kind of felt betrayed, like the rug had been pulled out from under me.\n\nThis seems...a little extreme.

But I bet your bf does not know anything about mixers, went to buy one and saw a lot cheaper option, went with it and bought you the other gifts, thinking he was doing a great job.

A kitchenAid goes for 500-1000$ min easy (im european so not sure how it translates) and he already spend at least 200$ on other gifts on top of an engagement ring?

You expect him to cough up what.. like 5k on presents/jewellery for you, and you have given him what exactly?", "NAH -- Navigating gift giving is an important. Your partner put effort into the gifts while you had your heart set on one specific item. May this experience bring about more communication on gift expectation, absolute 'wants', compromises...example:  couples exchange gifts and on black Friday they buy the 'one thing' they absolutely want if it was not gifted.  My uncle is a generous gift giver and we all knew he'd shop within  a week for an item(s) if he did not receive what he wanted.  Best to you.

You went in this fully knowing he couldn\u2019t afford to get you a kitchen aid. You got your own hopes up and it bit you in the ass.

If you really wanted that item, you can purchase it yourself", "YTA - your partner is trying to spend low and save money *for an engagement ring for you* and you asked for a Christmas gift between $500 and $1000. \n\nIF you specifically told him you wanted a kitchen aid, would say n-a-h except you let him spend the money to get you a kitchen aid after everything else. definitely YTA.", "YTA I've taught my children that the only appropriate reaction to a gift, no matter what it is, is an enthusiastic THANK YOU! What do you do if you get a gift that is the exact thing you already have? Say THANK YOU! What do you do if you get a gift you don't like? Say THANK YOU! What do you do if you get a big pile of poopies? Say THANK YOU! Nobody owes you your dream gift. If you want to return it later, approach that conversation gently later, not the moment you open the present.", "NAH. Next time, be more specific!", "NAH but this is why I'm against asking for appliances for Christmas.

It would have been better to be thankful and not say anything in the moment.  Next day, you can exchange it for what you want or start saving for one.  Kitchenaid stand mixers start at $350 minimum.   It is nice to have both kinds of mixers depending on your need.", "YTA for expecting anything and ungrateful.

He got what you asked for to the best of his abilities. For someone that fancies themselves as a cook, you should know better than to ask for anything kitchen related without being explicit about what you want and reiterating that nothing else is acceptable. 235 for some of us is high to put up for a mixer. Especially one like op's so bought is cheap and does a good enough job for the infrequency most of us use one. I've seen no significant difference with kitchen aid products other than having many fail prematurely.", "Lol I can understand why it would be difficult when you have no idea about cooking and baking. We were looking at a specific KitchenAid when I said I wanted one. My partner didn't understand that there was a difference between a KitchenAid and a plain stand mixer. I grew up seeing a KitchenAid in every home, so it never really occurred to me that not everyone knows what makes them different.", "We have a healthy relationship.

Stop gaslighting the OP for not liking a gift", "After seeing what the KitchenAid does, they definitely see the difference in quality.", "Yeah, I was definitely being a bit dramatic there.

Now that I have shown them the difference, they're excited about all the attachments and things we can do with it.", "Yeah, a lot of people really don't know what the difference is between a KitchenAid and a hand mixer on a stand. That's like saying \"we have beyblades at home\" and at home there's a dreidel.

It\u2019s about $350 when not on sale (Target has one on sale for $250 right now).  So the BF spent $200 on OP with the other gifts.  Another $50 for just the mixer is not a stretch, if he was listening.\n\nAlso, I get really wanting the mixer.  Told the family this year that if anything happened to my kitchen, it\u2019s the first thing I would replace after large appliances.  My husband bought me a new one a couple years ago (I really wanted a red one and we found a deeply discounted one for cheap). My son is now taking my 25+ year old one because it still works.  These things last forever and I use mine all the time.  I get the disappointment.", "I don't know where you're getting these numbers from. Lowest KitchenAid goes for like $250-300. There is no going broke or into debt here. We both have decent paying jobs and live below our means. I spent around $1200 on their presents. So I think you're assuming too much.", "Well the kitchen aid isn\u2019t what the person wanted so the partner wasted money", "Where on earth are you getting 5k from? You know an engagement ring doesn't have to cost $4000 right?", "That's a pretty good idea. We'll do that next year!", "Fair enough, this has pretty much been what has been making me feel the most like a jerk.", "I agree. The audacity of OP. Of course, she's allowed not to like the gift but cheese and crackers. How she went about it blows my mind how people are saying shes not the AH.

I really think this is a \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d situation. Gift giving can be tricky business sometimes, especially when purchasing for someone else\u2019s special interests\u2026it can be hard to nail it if you don\u2019t have similar interests.

Your partner didn't realize that you wanted *that* stand mixer, so just got one that they thought would work. \n\nNAH, imo.", "I did specify. We were looking at the one I wanted when I asked for it. And let's be real here, KitchenAid's are by far superior to a hand mixer on a stand.", "So no", "Aww. I can imagine they probably saw the cheaper one and we're like \"oh great! Now I can get my partner even more stuff\" with no idea it was that big of a difference. Definitely NAH and I agree it sounds like you two have good communication and they probably do understand and aren't just saying so to make you feel better.", "Oh my sweet, summer child. That's adorable. But no. \ud83d\ude06\n\nI told my husband the other day, I have made each of my children's birthday cakes. Countless cookies and cupcakes and souffl\u00e9es. Meringues. Cinnamon rolls. My KitchenAid stand mixer is my spirit animal. I'd say bury it with me, but what a waste because the dang thing will no doubt still work long after I'm gone!", "Im just making an estimate, but anything above 1k total is ridiculous anyway\n\nBesides. It\u2019s not really about the amount anyway. Forcing someone to spend money they don\u2019t have on you is ridiculous and a red flag for a unhealthy relationship.", "NOT a giant Ahole, more of just barely", "Don't cheap out and get the knock off attachments. Maybe half the price on Amazon but they don't work or last.  The base I bought 30 years ago was $200. So that's $7 a year. And a lot of baking.", "When it comes to kitchenware and appliances, I\u2019m all for \u201cbuy the best you can afford\u201d. It saves you tons of money down the line. But people who don\u2019t cook don\u2019t understand that. I have a Bosch kitchen machine that\u2019s 18 years old and still in perfect condition even though use it lot.", "I can't wait to start collecting attachments", "It\u2019s more like asking for an iPhone and getting a Nokia", "Yeah, I really wasn't expecting myself to have such a negative reaction. I feel like such a bitch about everything. But I know this won't break our relationship in any way. I really just needed to hear opinions that weren't coming from my too nice of a partner. So I'm grateful for your input", "It was fairly apparent which one I was talking about. I was playing with it when I said it. Even pointed out how it was within budget.", "It was actually worse than the hand mixer I already have. I was truly shocked they thought it was the same thing.", "My partner had the money, just had to take a little from savings.", "OP\u2019s partner spent $250 on vinyl, Lego, and the wrong stand mixer. $250 is what a kitchen aid stand mixer costs. No one was forcing her partner to spent the equivalent. You\u2019ve made up info into a straw man argument from the top down.", "I don't think that at all. I'm usually so much more excited to be the gift giver. I was more than happy with everything else they got me (including the motion sickness pills in my stocking XD). I actually intentionally spent way over budget by about $1000 because I wanted to make up for the past few Christmas' when I was ill and unable to really afford presents for my partner. Seeing their happiness at the gifts is what I really wanted more than anything. But then right after that: KitchenAid, Lol.", "Yeah, I want to make sure everything lasts", ">Did you ask for that specific KitchenAid mixer? Explaining why that was the one you wanted?\n\nSo again, no", "But he\u2019s uncomfortable with it and you didn\u2019t respect it.\nLook I get the stand mixer thing, I saved a long ass time for my kenwood. But if the roles were reversed (i am a woman) and he expected me to spend more then I feel comfortable with, I would get salty probably. Especially with inflation and wealth gap increasing even more.\n\nHaving that said though, he could have told you beforehand he wasn\u2019t able to give you the mixer and not give you the hand mixer to manage expectations. It isn\u2019t what you wanted so it\u2019s thrown away money anyway. Maybe the real issue here was a communication misstep on his side as well.\n\nSo I am gonna go with ESH instead.", "You\u2019re not taking the engagement ring into account. But like I said it\u2019s not even about the numbers. If the roles were reversed (I am a woman myself) and my boyfriend asked for more then I feel comfortable spending in this economy, I would get salty, and rightfully so.\n\nBut he could have communicated beforehand he wasn\u2019t able to get the mixer to manage expectations and not waste it on something she didn\u2019t want anyway.", "Totally agree with the silicon edged beater.  A total game changer!  Got mine for only around $14 during an Amazon sale.", "That beater is a must it doesn\u2019t come with them now but it\u2019s needed", "Pointing out that a specific mixer is under their budget is about as explicit as you can get without saying \u201cI want this one.\u201d so idk what your point here is.", "Then you're good to go!", "I wanted to check out the Kenwood's, but I couldn't find one anywhere.", "I'm in my '50s and got a KitchenAid mixer in the '90s. My mother wouldn't give me hers. So I went out and got one that's even nicer than hers!\n\nI don't know why they're not the standard. I don't think there is a KitchenAid branded one, but I also could be wrong.\n\nAnother game changer is if you have a Cuisinart food processor, you can get a lid that is just flat and not the whole feeder contraption. It's a game changer cuz it is just so much easier to clean than the whole multi-part feeder contraption. \n\nSo obviously sometimes you need that complex top lid. But a lot of times, you don't and having a lid that is just one part, that is more flat than not, really makes life easier.", "There are many many Kotchen aid stand mixer accessories available.\nTo be honest the product is amazing and won't break so they need to make their money on the accessories.\nI have two stand mixers one is mine the second is my Mom's and would never give them away.", ">Did you say \"I want this one\"?  \n>  \n>No  \n>  \n>ARGH BUT I CLEARLY IMPLIED IT\n\nCope", "I bought it in europe on german amazon.de (from germany to the netherlands), and they had combo deals with all kinds of attachments, far cheaper then Kitchenaid compared models (apparently judging from the comments they are probably a bit more expensive here).\n\nI did once ship a product from amazon.de to the US as a gift once, so maybe you\u2019re able to do it for one of those.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I was so harsh in the original comment, I hope you get an awesome mixer in the end.", "You're just setting unrealistic expectations. The context was clear enough to expect a certain level of situational awareness. Everything in life doesn't need to be spelled out perfectly. My partner *did* understand the context and admitted to knowing. They just didn't understand that there was that much of a difference in products.", "I think they sell for about the same price as the KitchenAids here. I've heard good things about the Kenwood's from YouTube videos I've seen. I'm very happy with the one we ended up getting though. Actually it's the step above the one I was looking at, and a nice mint green color.", "The answer to the question is still no, cope", "I have a Kenwood stand mixer that my Dad bought maybe 25-30 years ago (I can't quite remember the year we got it). Love it to bits.", "I like the way they look"]}
