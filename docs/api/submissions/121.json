{"id": 121, "submission_id": "yj1zfj", "title": "AITA for having friends over", "selftext": "Aita for having my friends over on Halloween even though it is a school night? My friends and I wanted to get together to watch Halloween movies and have a few drinks. My one friend just moved today and my other friend was having cleaning done at her place therefore my place was the only one that we could go to. For context I have 3 other roommates and I texted our roommate group chat and informed them that I would be having two people over. None of them texted back or objected the idea. So I thought it would be okay. Also we are all in college or university. My friends got here at 9:30 and left at midnight and we were not overly loud or disrespectful towards my other roommates. But my one roommate texted my boyfriend who is one of my roommates complaining that I was having people over on a school night. Which I wish she could have come directly to me if she had an issue and came up to me and seemed annoyed at me before they had arrived but never said that I couldn\u2019t have anyone over. And as soon as I seen that my roommate had her light off we started whispering and turned down the tv. But she is being very passive aggressive and slamming doors. So am I the asshole for not considering not having people over on a school night?", "created_utc": 1667287691, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj1zfj/aita_for_having_friends_over/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You texted the group chat and no one responded. If they had a problem with it, they should have said something.", "NTA.  You gave them notice and a way to voice objections. And lowered voices etc when you saw signs of them going to sleep", "NTA. You did everything right.", "info- you said\n\n>But my one roommate texted my boyfriend who is one of my roommates complaining that I was having people over on a school night\n\nso then the boyfriend was in the group chat?", "NTA, you gave them an opportunity to say express themselves and they didn't. Though, I guess I could see them being annoyed at the time because 930-12 is kinda late but they also could have asked when you told them about it.", "Yes he was also in the group chat but she complained to him and didn\u2019t address any problem to myself", "Info: How long did you give your roommates to respond to your text?"]}
