He replied with a name. I asked who she was and he replied with \"a friend\" who was over helping him with some house stuff, like cleaning my floor. He then goes on to berate me about how he did all of this stuff while I was away and how he has provided 1, 2 and 3 to me. Which none of my other partners have done. I eventually just gave up on being called ungrateful because I couldn't get through to him. I said thank you multiple times while I was on the trip when he updated me. I always thank him and tell him how lucky I am. I guess he was offended that I should ask this after just getting home. He wasn't home and I'd been talking to him throughout the travel day.\n\nToday I told him I had booked a haircut for one of our kids and was able to get a pedi at the same time. He then told me he would be in a different province. I then found out later he had a second trip booked for an entirely different province he didn't tell me about. We have had this problem before where he doesn't tell me about work trips which ends up messing with my schedules with the kids. I have asked many times to keep me updated about this.\n\nHe has made me feel like the asshole for asking to know his friends as the majority i dont know, (especially if they're \"helping me\") and for asking to be kept up to date about trips. He called my behavior dickish and me a bitch despite making 0 allegations or alluding to such because I was afraid of his response.\n\nHistory:\n- he has cheated even when I was pregnant. I only stayed because I was afraid of what divorce would do to the kids and his \"promises\". We put on a healthy front for the kids.\n- he made essentially 10x what I made when we started dating\n- I now make 6 figures through a lot of hard work, but he still makes 3x what I do\n- I pay my share towards mortgage, all of car and house insurance, internet, phones, power and most Groceries, usually all of house cleaning\n- I take care of the kids 80% of the time. \n- he bought the house\n- he bought my car\n- has helped financially as needed though I usually am able to pay back in full\n- is a good dad when he's around\n- is a good person to his friends and family\n\nI think I know the answer but I'm just so lost. Am I the asshole for asking those questions and asking to be more of his life?", "created_utc": 1692146114, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15saavn/aitah_found_a_scrunchie_in_my_husbands_car_after/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re teaching your children to accept being treated like dirt by partners. Leave.", "NTA. Personally I'd stop questioning him and start talking to a divorce attorney.", "NTA. Leave!  He is duplicitous and at least verbally abusive.  Please get out - it will be better for you and the kids.", "NTA. Op, kids are happier in divorced homes than they are in toxic ones. He\u2019s already proven once that he can\u2019t be trusted due to infidelity and you\u2019re still letting his gaslight you about cheating? Don\u2019t let your kids grow up thinking this is okay. They can pick up on this stuff.", "Re your bulleted list\u2026 some things can\u2019t be compensated for. If he cheats 3 days out of 45 but pays for your car every month, do those equal out to you? Or, taking it to a more extreme analogy, if a husband beats his wife once a month, do the other 30 days actually make up for it? These are things only you can answer.

I can't even imagine what your marriage is doing to the kids! You need to get out now! Cheaters never stop cheating. They just get better at hiding it. He's defensive because he's lying to you.

It sounds like he might be lying to his friends about your marriage and possibly has an entirely different gf around them. \n\nBtw you\u2019re NTA for your questions. Nothing you\u2019ve asked is unreasonable, especially since what he does inconveniences you and the kids and disrupts your plans.", "And did you call that person and ask for an explanation? Did you at least call that person and say hey I'm his wife what's up with this card? If nothing else... Like even if you're going to leave him... You need to blow this up for him or he's just going to move right into his relationship with these other people. Tell people the truth!", "It's NOT healthy for them. You know they're seeing through you. Get therapy. Get out.", "I'm just going to elaborate on what fuzzy mom said up above... My exhusband was raised watching his dad cheat on his mother. She put up with it because she was Catholic and they don't divorce. He saw it again and again and again with the different fights and breakups but then get back together one person moves out moves back in etc etc He hates his dad with a passion for what he did to his mom! Guess who got divorced twice for cheating.... My ex-husband! He can hate his dad all he wants but the truth is he turned into him because he saw it as a kid.\n\nWhen we started getting divorced he told me he married me because I was an ordained deacon and he thought I was a \"safe bet\". Yup, He thought I would stay like his mom did. He thought my religion was as strong as hers and I was going to just put up with it. He never once considered not cheating because it's what he saw his whole life growing up.\n\nJust a little reminder that your kids are watching. You think they don't know, but they do! If you want your kids to end up in the exact same relationship you have, then stay.", "I mean, no, it's on him for cheating.  But you would do best to get out.  It will actually hurt the kids more in the long run if you stay.  Leave, be honest with them, and get them therapy.  Good luck.", "That's what I am afraid of. He said he was talking to this friend about our problems and maybe she misunderstood and thought he had gotten with this other girl. But explained to her we had gotten cousnelling and things were good and she misunderstood. \nI met this person that summer with our kids...", "Your problem is you've got a cheating asshole for a husband.", "I think she may have been trying to give you a hint", "you need to get a lawyer immediately."]}
