Early November, my sister took my phone, goes on my Instagram and finds a photo of me and my ex-GF from 7 years ago. She outed me to my parents as being gay and after being hurt repeatedly, my Mum said I'm no longer welcome in the family. I lost my entire family, my fur babies (they couldn't come with), and am about to spend my first Christmas alone in a new city with no friends. \n\nEnter my co-worker, I'll call her...Nell. We started together last month. Nell (20sF) has had a really nice upbringing and has an accepting family that wouldn't do the above. She can be sweet but it is obvious that some of the woes of the world, like bullying or my situation, have not passed through her life so she doesn't understand.\n\nNell asked me about my  Christmas plans and I said what I would be doing - on my own, playing RE: Village and drinking/eating. Nell asked the obvious \"why don't you go see your family?\" and I bluntly told her that we aren't speaking, and I am not interested in doing so. She then started asking why, how could I not speak to them, that family accepts family and nothing should change that, etc., and also started doing this thing where she pokes me and smiles saying I should try a little harder. These prods gave me bruises because she jabs like the Hutt. I said it's personal, but she asked for ***over a week*** why we don't speak and trying to encourage me to go see them, in private or in front of others who know my situation.\n\nI snapped on day 9 of her asking 6-8 times a day and told her the above and some more details, adding in that I'd rather not be around the people who said that being dead would be better than having a child who is a (slur for gay women). I told her that she needs to understand that some families aren't like hers and her constant pushing caused this situation (me snapping at her), even after I asked her to stop repeatedly. Nell was horrified about the situation and started crying quite hysterically, saying that I was a monster for making her out to be the bad guy when she was just trying to reunite a family for a happy Christmas. The partners on our team, and anyone within a 30ft reach saw her sobbing and yelling at me. I have received multiple dirty looks, whispers and a couple of hurtful comments that I could have been nicer to her. Now an email from HR has come through stating several people have complained that I have bullied Nell and caused a hostile work environment by snapping at her. At least 60 people saw her doing this over the days repeatedly and no one said a thing and let it happen, but now I stopped being nice, I am the bad guy.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole? I tried to be nice, then firm, then bluntly said \"please stop asking as it is a sensitive topic that we aren't close enough to talk about properly\" before Day 9 happened. I feel like the AH because I made her cry and I did not intend to hurt her with the truth.", "created_utc": 1702650468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18j1ba7/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_exactly_why_i_am/", "score": 1204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd use that if I were you because you'd actually have things going more in your favor.\n\nI just realized her last victim was also gay....hmmm.", "What you said doesn't sound unreasonable. I have to conclude that her crying has convinced people you were much harsher than you were. And I assume her co-workers are friends with her, so they are predisposed to taking her side anyway. Sorry you work with crappy people. Might be worth keeping an eye out for new jobs.", "Wtf? Are the pro-Nell people trying to fuck her or something? What's wrong with them?", "Empathetic isn\u2019t the word I\u2019d use to describe her. She\u2019s just unable to handle criticism or rejection to an extreme degree. I hate to be that person describing a woman experiencing a lot of emotions as \u201coverly sensitive\u201d but she honestly is. I also have a hard time with rejection and criticism, that\u2019s what therapy is for.\n\nShe is the opposite of empathetic, as that means the ability to put yourself in the shoes of someone experiencing something outside of your own experience. She\u2019s clearly got a hard time recognizing that other people don\u2019t all have happy families, much less respecting when she\u2019s clearly being told that the story she\u2019s asking for isn\u2019t a happy one and she needs to back off.\n\nThis woman needs so much therapy and to never bother OP again", "Right?! Like sit down Dr. Phil!!! That was the part that made me loathe her. IDK how anyone felt bad for her.", "Yeah I have a friend who wondered about my not talking to my mother (who she knows) and said things like you should contact her. (She's Catholic but not a crazy one, just super family orientated, I've met her parents they are cool) and kept pushing me. Until I finally was just like, let me explain my mother to you. Admittedly it wasn't everyday she was doing it or multiple times a day, but the intense irritation I get, and had I been in this girl's shoes I would have blown up as well. At least my friend would only ask once, and when I told her she just went like well shit and left it alone.", "She is the bad guy, but you don't let someone harass you 6-8 times per day, for 9 days, and then snap.\n\nYou go to HR after they violate your boundary the first time, and then let HR tell that person they are being offensive.\n\nOP could have handled this much differently.", "OMG, I  read that and thought OP was being metaphorical, not that Nell was actually, physically poking her.  So I had to go back and re-read.  \n\n\nNell's behavior, even without the assault, is inexcusable.  But the poking?  She's lucky you didn't finally snap and just poke her back, hard and firm on her breastbone, as you yelled at her.  Then again, if OP had done that, I suspect she would have been terminated, not Nell.", "Yikes! That was definately banapants or rather a whole bana outfit (to steal the phrase from the story). Sheesh!", "I tend to slightly \"undersell\" as a strategy, but neither is wrong!", "No, I'm good!", "> No it\u2019s not the way NIMBY is used.\n\nYes, that's why I said \"it does fit\" instead of \"this is obviously the exact thing being communicated here in every single way\"", "I mean sure, I used a pretty sturdy shoehorn in this instance, but NIMBY neighborhoods tend to be pretty, ah, beige in multiple ways, that's kind their whole *thing*.", "I assume that OP means they're fine with OTHER people being gay, just not in their own family, so yeah, NIMBY makes sense.", "Well, it doesn\u2019t speak to their good judgement or anything. But to be fair to them they are essentially part victim of her manipulation- it\u2019s more likely they just don\u2019t care than that they actively believe her, but she is likely successful at convincing others to write off her behavior as not too weird in any case. Hopefully this incident will lead to some reevaluation.", "Sure, agreed.   But that makes OP into a non-confrontational person, but does it make her the asshole?     I don't think so.  Bullies don't get let off the hook because their victim didn't handle the situation with a shiny backbone from the beginning.", "At least, I hope OP will learn from this, in a work environment, talk to HR before it becomes unbearable. Even if you wish to be non confrontational, \"I don't want her to suffer anything, but prevent her front asking me every hour something private\"", "Always an adult in these threads.", "I think Nell likely has boundary issues in general, and doesn\u2019t realize that she can technically be arrested for her behavior. I don\u2019t think she actually would be unless it\u2019s a really slow day for the local police, but there\u2019s no argument that she technically committed assault", "I\u2019ll get the popcorn \ud83c\udf7f", "I was able to understand what she meant but it\u2019s just not how nimby should be used", "but but the adults are outnumbered by the rest of us!", "See that right below!!  No lawyer war for you today!! (Vultures)", "Yeah man, I've agreed with you this entire time, I don't know what you want from me here."]}
