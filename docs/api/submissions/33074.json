Early November, my sister took my phone, goes on my Instagram and finds a photo of me and my ex-GF from 7 years ago. She outed me to my parents as being gay and after being hurt repeatedly, my Mum said I'm no longer welcome in the family. I lost my entire family, my fur babies (they couldn't come with), and am about to spend my first Christmas alone in a new city with no friends. \n\nEnter my co-worker, I'll call her...Nell. We started together last month. Nell (20sF) has had a really nice upbringing and has an accepting family that wouldn't do the above. She can be sweet but it is obvious that some of the woes of the world, like bullying or my situation, have not passed through her life so she doesn't understand.\n\nNell asked me about my  Christmas plans and I said what I would be doing - on my own, playing RE: Village and drinking/eating. Nell asked the obvious \"why don't you go see your family?\" and I bluntly told her that we aren't speaking, and I am not interested in doing so. She then started asking why, how could I not speak to them, that family accepts family and nothing should change that, etc., and also started doing this thing where she pokes me and smiles saying I should try a little harder. These prods gave me bruises because she jabs like the Hutt. I said it's personal, but she asked for ***over a week*** why we don't speak and trying to encourage me to go see them, in private or in front of others who know my situation.\n\nI snapped on day 9 of her asking 6-8 times a day and told her the above and some more details, adding in that I'd rather not be around the people who said that being dead would be better than having a child who is a (slur for gay women). I told her that she needs to understand that some families aren't like hers and her constant pushing caused this situation (me snapping at her), even after I asked her to stop repeatedly. Nell was horrified about the situation and started crying quite hysterically, saying that I was a monster for making her out to be the bad guy when she was just trying to reunite a family for a happy Christmas. The partners on our team, and anyone within a 30ft reach saw her sobbing and yelling at me. I have received multiple dirty looks, whispers and a couple of hurtful comments that I could have been nicer to her. Now an email from HR has come through stating several people have complained that I have bullied Nell and caused a hostile work environment by snapping at her. At least 60 people saw her doing this over the days repeatedly and no one said a thing and let it happen, but now I stopped being nice, I am the bad guy.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole? I tried to be nice, then firm, then bluntly said \"please stop asking as it is a sensitive topic that we aren't close enough to talk about properly\" before Day 9 happened. I feel like the AH because I made her cry and I did not intend to hurt her with the truth.", "created_utc": 1702650468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18j1ba7/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_exactly_why_i_am/", "score": 499, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then use the notepad to note who is there with date and time, and as you can notes as to what is said and what they say will happen after the meeting. Afterwards add everything you can think of to your notes, then send an email to HR as a recap of the conversation and what is supposed to happen, good or bad for you ( but evidence for possible lawsuit). \n\n\" Based on the meeting this morning in [location] this is my understanding of what is going to be done about Nell's continued harassment of me. [Detail the results of the meeting] \n\nPlease let me know if I have any of this wrong. \" \n\nIf your boss was not there then add him as \"bcc:\" if you didn't know this is called blind copy, it will send your boss a copy of the email that doesn't show on the others email header. Make a copy of the notes and take either the original home or the copy (I'm worried they may try to get those notes from you). \n\nI would also encourage you to do some internet searching for labor law specialists in your area in case nothing is donetocNell about her actions and harassment of you.", "It\u2019s tough because HR is so variable. Sometimes you have a good one and sometimes it\u2019s shockingly bad. I\u2019ve gone to HR for homophobic/sexual harassment before and been told that I was the problem. I hope it works out for OP but often, it does not go well for minorities.", "I used a voice to text thing to message my flatmate (who is an angel atm) so I have the copied (and edited because the grammar was awful on the text) version. My words were basically \"Look, I have said how many times over the last week I don't want to see them, but you just won't stop. You even assaulted me to the point of bruising - wtf is wrong with you? I left home with a black eye and a swollen jaw after being told by my mother that she'd rather I kill myself than be gay and that I was no daughter of hers. I get that your family is great - it's amazing you have family who would support you if someone outed you to them, but for myself and many others, including some people in this office, we didn't have that luxury. My ability to come out on my terms was ripped away from me. It is painful and you just add to the torture this holiday is causing by constantly pushing for an answer you are NOT entitled to. I'm asking you one more time before I go to HR: please STOP.\"\n\nI'm autistic so sometimes my voice can have more/less inflection or mood than I mean to put out. I have been trying to learn how to lessen this, but it is tricky. The final time he came to me was as I was trying to fix an important document that she knew I needed to not be disturbed while doing and had been talking for 15 minutes, not getting the hint, before I did.\n\nShe is apparently a very empathetic person(I think this is the word?) As in, she has cried multiple times before because a higher up has looked over her work and given not good feedback - not even harsh critique! A  \"you could have added a little more here\" or \"this isn't exactly what I meant but we have time now to fix it if you want help\" and she has burst into tears.\n\nThe people who are saying I bullied her are also the ones who said the higher ups were picking on her for no reason when giving feedback. They have started a smear campaign that caused a guy to quit because he rejected her when she asked him out because he was gay and happily married, and she became inconsolable.", "From experience from a years-ago former friend: some people will cry if you tell them their behavior and/or comments hurt you and why because \"they feel so badly about it.\" My own read on that is \"some people find being called out for nasty jokes or vastly overstepping boundaries is hurtful\" but ymmv.", "How is it \"pick me\"?", ">Also mention the physical poking and the brusing\n\nThis.  Show them the bruises.  Maybe file a police report, because poking someone hard enough to bruise is insane.", "And that you're unsure how much of the backlash you're getting now is discrimination since you (as the queer individual) made the (happy cis lady who just wanted everyone to get along) cry by exposing her to your tragic backstory after she disregarded your clearly stated boundaries for a week and a half.", "Also, instead of \"failed to take the hint\", \"failed to respond to my explicit request to stop\". It wasn't a *hint*. Those can be missed, especially for someone like me who is sometimes oblivious to *hints*. This was a clearly communicated request to stop.", "OP stated that the jabs caused bruising, would that not constitute repeated physical battery?", "My specialty is ediscovery.  I guess my approach was a touch more aggressive.  Should we do the traditional attorney thing and have a log drawn out argument that bored everyone else to tears?  i would prefer not to today.", "I wish I\u2019d seen this comment before posting my own (more poorly worded, less complete, lol) one! This is perfect advice.", "She is NOT your friend and is not to be trusted. Do not engage with her outside of work-related topics and do so via email if you have to talk to her. Document every instance of her bothering you if you can with dates and relative times. As others noted, give HR the entire timeline of events, her actions/assault, ect. Also, reach out to a lawyer for advice. HR works in the best interest of the company, so it doesn't hurt to get an outside opinion.", "Honestly, the fact that she has a history of inappropriate emotional responses in the workplace is kind of good for you. This woman sounds like a huge liability. I\u2019d want her tf out of my company.", "Please do!"]}
