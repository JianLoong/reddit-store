My family is on the bigger side. It\u2019s not an obesity or overeating issue, we\u2019re just big people. My husband\u2019s family is the opposite; short and thin, every single one of them. To be honest, being around them took some getting used to, since I absolutely tower over all of them, my husband included (he\u2019s a short king and I love him for it). My kids are a mix. Ruby got my body type, Owen got my husband\u2019s body type, and though it\u2019s hard to tell at her age we think Nora is in between. \n\nSo, the other day, the five of us were over at my MIL\u2019s place for dinner. Since they\u2019re little and make messes, I start to dish up the ziti onto my kids plates, starting with Ruby. My MIL comments: \u201cYou know, she\u2019s getting quite big, you should control her portions better.\u201d \n\nMe: \u201cShe\u2019s at a healthy weight for her age, but thanks.\u201d\n\nMIL: \u201cNo she\u2019s not. I raised five kids and taught for two decades, I know when a kid isn\u2019t eating healthy. You need to cut back on all of their portions, or Nora will end up like that too.\u201d \n\nMy husband: \u201cThe kids are fine mom, we know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nMIL: \u201cOh darling, just because [my name] is ahem, *on the bigger side* doesn\u2019t mean my grandkids have to be too.\u201d\n\nMe (losing my cool, but not quite shouting): \u201c[MIL\u2019s name], shut the f*** up. My kids aren\u2019t fat, you\u2019re just a bitch. Quit trying to parent my kids.\u201d \n\nMeanwhile, my husband has gathered our things (our coats, my purse, and Nora\u2019s stuffed animal). He bundled us out before the situation could escalate further. He later told me that he as proud of me for standing up for our kids, but that he wished I had a better handle on my temper. \n\nI vented to my sister later on, but she told me that I was the one being a bitch. She said that my MIL was just trying to help, that it wasn\u2019t her fault that she wasn\u2019t used to our body type, and that my kids probably did look fat compared to how her kids looked when they were little. \n\nAITA for what I said to my MIL?", "created_utc": 1682964258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134wlr1/aita_for_telling_my_mil_to_stfu_after_she/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe calling her a bitch in earshot of your kids is ever so slightly wrong, but that minor misconduct is more than forgivable considering Ruby's grandma is nitpicking at her size, which potentially could change what with puberty. I mean, Christ, does she want to contribute to an anorexic granddaughter? \n\nIn short, your sister's wrong, your MIL is a dick, you're an excellent mum and it's good to see your husband at the very least supports you defending the kids. \n\nNTA", "NTA- those comments can be extremely dangerous, they're microaggressions and if your kids hear this and internalize it, they will struggle unnecessarily.

Defend your children, always, and completely monitor what time they spend with MIL unsupervised. I guarantee you if she\u2019s that forward with you, she\u2019s saying similar things directly to them. \n\nPS. I\u2019m glad your husband is proud of you for standing up to HIS mother, but he could also stand up for his wife, too. How often does she make comments about your body like that in front of your husband? Does he defend you to his mother? Or only when she makes comments about the children?", "Mmm I dunno.

My niece was 13 years old and she & her 13 year old stepsister were splitting a cheap 10 inch frozen pizza.  My SIL yelled at my niece about being a fatty who needed a 2nd slice, while her own daughter - who was shorter and outweighed my niece by a good 20 lbs if not more - was given the rest of the pizza to eat.  My niece gave me a look that said not to say anything, so I didn't.\n\nThat was 15+ years ago and now her dad and stepmom are divorcing.  She called me recently to find out what was going on as she doesn't really stay in touch with her stepsiblings, stepmom or dad.  I asked why and was shocked to find out the truth.  Her stepmom wouldn't allow her to eat when she was at her dad's house. She was told to buy her own groceries if she wanted to eat at their house.  Every weekend she was there, she was starved.  She never told her mom but she started refusing to go to her dad's about a year after the incident I witnessed.  She joined track and other sports, so she always had an excuse to not go.  She has never forgiven her stepmom for doing that to her snd won't forgive her dad for letting it happen. \n\nOf course now that he has left that monster, he wants to be in his only daughter's life (aka move in with her) and she refuses to contact him because she knows that's the only reason he has reached out to her.  \n\nI was so pissed during my call with her, that this went on and she never said anything.  She told me she knew if she said anything to me, her dad's brother (my husband) and I would \"take care\" of the situation, but she didn't want us to go to jail.  Instead, she focused in the great family her mom and step-dad provided, and her step-dad suspected donething was up, so he encouraged her to be \"too busy\" to go to her dad's.  She never told him but he knew \n\nPeople like this deserve a special place in purgatory!\n\nYou are NTA!", "NTA or at least a very justified asshole.", "How was your MIL trying to help?

That's not trying to help, that's fat-shaming not only your child but you too!  Good for you for standing up to her!", "NTA- situations like those you just have to let them have it, so they know where you stand on the matter, and to put them in their place. if you were more polite about it, i don\u2019t think MIL would have gotten your point", "NTA you told her the kids were healthy. She decided to buck up and act like she knew better.", "NTA.  You've been in MIL's life for over ten years so this isn't \"she isn't used to it.\"  Best case, she's bought into diet culture.

She pushed too far but since you blew up a little she\u2019s now going to blame your temper for it escalating.", "NTA. You tried to politely shut her down and she kept going and got ruder. Was your outburst ideal? No but your MIL is still the asshole here.", "NTA. Good on you for shutting that nonsense down. I wouldn't allow my kids to be around her without supervision. Guaranteed she's policing everything they do/eat the instant your back is turned.", "NTA- you expressed your disagreement and the MIL kept pressing the issue.", "That would be the last time my MIL saw my kids if.

You could mention that it's much unhealthier to have an eating disorder than to be a little big. That your children's happiness is much more important to you than their dimensions. That if she disagrees with the doctors evaluation, she's welcome to take issue just as soon as she presents her own medical degree. \n\nWhat you did wasn't wrong, but I think you would have gotten better results *and* come across more like the good guy if you had expounded instead of just exploding.

If you let this slide, you risk it escalating towards your children being told this to their and/or them thinking something is wrong with their body.

My only follow-up recommendation is to make sure your children hear from you that what she said is not okay and that will you always have their back, even if it involves family.", "NTA. I'm bigger because of genetics and not being able to eat as much as I actually needed when I was a child was hell and gas physically altered me forever. I had to go without eating so long and so much for the sake of \"controlling my portions\" that my body has literally stopped creating regular hunger signals. I have been to a dietitian before and they have straight up told me that even as an adult due to time blindness and my body failing to properly signal when I need food, the reason I'm overweight is not because I eat too much but because I eat too little. \n\nObviously don't overfeed them or let them go crazy, but if your kid says they need more food then it's good to trust them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its never your business.", "Honest to God, she'd never spend a single moment alone with my children ever again.", "Time to have a convo with the kids about how when people comment on other\u2019s bodies it\u2019s really about their own insecurities.", "I\u2019d be *livid*, my children know it\u2019s inappropriate to make comments about someone\u2019s body - I don\u2019t see why adults can\u2019t grasp the concept as well.", "oh my god, I went with the assumption that she didn't hear. You were totally in your right to get angry. I'm honestly a bit surprised that your husband thinks your temper was bad. Does he understand the potential consequences of hearing such things as a child?", "Don't let her be around them alone again unless you believe she has actually changed her ways. I was told age 5 or 6 by my grandfather that I was too chubby and should look more like my (always been thinner) twin sister. I'm 29 and I still remember exactly where we were and who was around. That shit stays.", "And remind your sister that MIL made the comments in front of the kids too. That makes the situation way worse and put you into the position where you HAD to defend your children or risk them thinking her comments were appropriate.", "Yes, you can be genetically predisposed to more muscle mass, obesity, and/or fat, etc. \n\nEnvironment, life style, etc. is clearly a factor but genetics is a factor in your size. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason all the Gronkowski brothers played football.", "That doesn't mean Grandma has to fat shame a ten year old. I don't know of a single child who never went through a chubby phase, with or without good eating habits. The human body is a weird thing. And, lol, there is such a thing as being genetically disposed to being a larger person. Sometimes people just are bigger than others.", "75% of women report eating disordered behavior so maybe you can take this BS argument somewhere else.", "I'm looking for your degree in medicine or biology to back up the assertion that no one is genetically big because medical science disagrees with you. How about you stop spreading toxic nonsense?", "Anorexia isn't the only type of eating disorder. There's binge eating disorder, bulimia, and more.", "I hope for your sake and your children\u2019s sake, your husband truly works on that. As the kids get older, they will no doubt notice the awful things grandma says about their mom while their dad just lets it happen.", "uhhhhhhhh why not?  \n\nWithout doing tests like those you will never know the truth.  \n\nWe all know that the average A1C Test of an American is higher than compared to most.  \n\nLike OP said size does not really matter, for some cases but tests like these will determine if you do/will have health problems due to unhealthy food consumption down the line.", "There are still so many people who feel its acceptable to comment on people\u2019s health because they may be perceived as being overweight.", "are fat when they really aren\u2019t \n\n\\- so how do you know this for sure though?", "Dont you know you can tell a persons entire health history just by looking them? \n\n/s", "[deleted]", "Or at all. After all, she said this while the parents were there. She'd never get another chance to pull that shit if it were my kids.", "I think he\u2019s more frustrated that I swore in front of the kids, which is fair in my opinion.", "You nor MIL are their doctor. All you need to know is you dont comment on people\u2019s weight or health unless they ask you to. \n\nYou going to ask all skinny people about their blood sugar too just in case?", "You can comment on someone's health after knowing the facts/statistics.   It's called caring.  Same thing a doctor does at the office.  I cannot comment on what the MIL said however because I do not know enough about OP's family's eating habits/health.", "Because I have no reason to question the post\u2019s truthfulness at this point. I mean it might be all made up by a bored troll, but assuming it\u2019s true, I\u2019m going to take  the word of a woman who isn\u2019t speaking nastily about the bodies of children over the one who does.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134wlr1/aita_for_telling_my_mil_to_stfu_after_she/jigltve/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3\n\nLook up.", "Ruby will remember you standing up for her. You didn\u2019t say any slurs. She was being awful. The only way to protect your child for comments like that is to be very strong in response maybe late cursing is an ideal but you were pissed at you had a right to be.", "of course.  But being skinny is actually the least of our concerns.  Majority of the nation is not skinny at all lmfao.  And, more ppl are dying from diseases that STEM from BEING overweight/obese, NOT from being too thin.....just so you know.", "No. Its never anyone else\u2019s business.", "[deleted]", "And youre still not OPs doctor or her kids doctor. So its still none of your business.", "It's my business if it's concerning my family/friends, wtf are you smoking right now lmfao.", "So asked and answered. Dont know why youre doubling down on calling a chid fat.", "lmfao you are super dense.  I think it's just because you are scared of disclosing the truth..for some odd reason.  Would you say the same about COVID vaccination disclosure?  Do you believe people need to disclose they got a vaccine?  Please entertain me.", "\u2026 do you know OP? Are you the MIL!?", "What truth am I scared to disclose\u2026? What does that even mean. \n\nAlso if youre going to compare judging fat people to vaccination requirements, thats comparing apples to a global health crisis and not a conversation I will entertain in this space.", "I am literally living rent free in your comments right now lol", "You\u2019re not, I tend to comment here a lot, one (many) might say too much."]}
