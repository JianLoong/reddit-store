My family is on the bigger side. It\u2019s not an obesity or overeating issue, we\u2019re just big people. My husband\u2019s family is the opposite; short and thin, every single one of them. To be honest, being around them took some getting used to, since I absolutely tower over all of them, my husband included (he\u2019s a short king and I love him for it). My kids are a mix. Ruby got my body type, Owen got my husband\u2019s body type, and though it\u2019s hard to tell at her age we think Nora is in between. \n\nSo, the other day, the five of us were over at my MIL\u2019s place for dinner. Since they\u2019re little and make messes, I start to dish up the ziti onto my kids plates, starting with Ruby. My MIL comments: \u201cYou know, she\u2019s getting quite big, you should control her portions better.\u201d \n\nMe: \u201cShe\u2019s at a healthy weight for her age, but thanks.\u201d\n\nMIL: \u201cNo she\u2019s not. I raised five kids and taught for two decades, I know when a kid isn\u2019t eating healthy. You need to cut back on all of their portions, or Nora will end up like that too.\u201d \n\nMy husband: \u201cThe kids are fine mom, we know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nMIL: \u201cOh darling, just because [my name] is ahem, *on the bigger side* doesn\u2019t mean my grandkids have to be too.\u201d\n\nMe (losing my cool, but not quite shouting): \u201c[MIL\u2019s name], shut the f*** up. My kids aren\u2019t fat, you\u2019re just a bitch. Quit trying to parent my kids.\u201d \n\nMeanwhile, my husband has gathered our things (our coats, my purse, and Nora\u2019s stuffed animal). He bundled us out before the situation could escalate further. He later told me that he as proud of me for standing up for our kids, but that he wished I had a better handle on my temper. \n\nI vented to my sister later on, but she told me that I was the one being a bitch. She said that my MIL was just trying to help, that it wasn\u2019t her fault that she wasn\u2019t used to our body type, and that my kids probably did look fat compared to how her kids looked when they were little. \n\nAITA for what I said to my MIL?", "created_utc": 1682964258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134wlr1/aita_for_telling_my_mil_to_stfu_after_she/", "score": 624, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe calling her a bitch in earshot of your kids is ever so slightly wrong, but that minor misconduct is more than forgivable considering Ruby's grandma is nitpicking at her size, which potentially could change what with puberty. I mean, Christ, does she want to contribute to an anorexic granddaughter? \n\nIn short, your sister's wrong, your MIL is a dick, you're an excellent mum and it's good to see your husband at the very least supports you defending the kids. \n\nNTA", "NTA- those comments can be extremely dangerous, they're microaggressions and if your kids hear this and internalize it, they will struggle unnecessarily.

Defend your children, always, and completely monitor what time they spend with MIL unsupervised. I guarantee you if she\u2019s that forward with you, she\u2019s saying similar things directly to them. \n\nPS. I\u2019m glad your husband is proud of you for standing up to HIS mother, but he could also stand up for his wife, too. How often does she make comments about your body like that in front of your husband? Does he defend you to his mother? Or only when she makes comments about the children?", "Mmm I dunno.

My niece was 13 years old and she & her 13 year old stepsister were splitting a cheap 10 inch frozen pizza.  My SIL yelled at my niece about being a fatty who needed a 2nd slice, while her own daughter - who was shorter and outweighed my niece by a good 20 lbs if not more - was given the rest of the pizza to eat.  My niece gave me a look that said not to say anything, so I didn't.\n\nThat was 15+ years ago and now her dad and stepmom are divorcing.  She called me recently to find out what was going on as she doesn't really stay in touch with her stepsiblings, stepmom or dad.  I asked why and was shocked to find out the truth.  Her stepmom wouldn't allow her to eat when she was at her dad's house. She was told to buy her own groceries if she wanted to eat at their house.  Every weekend she was there, she was starved.  She never told her mom but she started refusing to go to her dad's about a year after the incident I witnessed.  She joined track and other sports, so she always had an excuse to not go.  She has never forgiven her stepmom for doing that to her snd won't forgive her dad for letting it happen. \n\nOf course now that he has left that monster, he wants to be in his only daughter's life (aka move in with her) and she refuses to contact him because she knows that's the only reason he has reached out to her.  \n\nI was so pissed during my call with her, that this went on and she never said anything.  She told me she knew if she said anything to me, her dad's brother (my husband) and I would \"take care\" of the situation, but she didn't want us to go to jail.  Instead, she focused in the great family her mom and step-dad provided, and her step-dad suspected donething was up, so he encouraged her to be \"too busy\" to go to her dad's.  She never told him but he knew \n\nPeople like this deserve a special place in purgatory!\n\nYou are NTA!", "NTA or at least a very justified asshole.", "How was your MIL trying to help?

That's not trying to help, that's fat-shaming not only your child but you too!  Good for you for standing up to her!", "NTA- situations like those you just have to let them have it, so they know where you stand on the matter, and to put them in their place. if you were more polite about it, i don\u2019t think MIL would have gotten your point", "NTA you told her the kids were healthy. She decided to buck up and act like she knew better.", "NTA.  You've been in MIL's life for over ten years so this isn't \"she isn't used to it.\"  Best case, she's bought into diet culture.

She pushed too far but since you blew up a little she\u2019s now going to blame your temper for it escalating.", "NTA. You tried to politely shut her down and she kept going and got ruder. Was your outburst ideal? No but your MIL is still the asshole here.", "NTA. Good on you for shutting that nonsense down. I wouldn't allow my kids to be around her without supervision. Guaranteed she's policing everything they do/eat the instant your back is turned.", "NTA- you expressed your disagreement and the MIL kept pressing the issue.", "That would be the last time my MIL saw my kids if.

It seems like you know something that she said was maybe correct/honest and you really just got triggered from it.  \n\nYTA.", "NTA -- you were justified-- but I think it would have been more productive to actually dress her down about her misunderstanding of genetics and body types. You could mention that it's much unhealthier to have an eating disorder than to be a little big. That your children's happiness is much more important to you than their dimensions. That if she disagrees with the doctors evaluation, she's welcome to take issue just as soon as she presents her own medical degree. \n\nWhat you did wasn't wrong, but I think you would have gotten better results *and* come across more like the good guy if you had expounded instead of just exploding.

If you let this slide, you risk it escalating towards your children being told this to their and/or them thinking something is wrong with their body.

As a victim of a hateful MIL, I cheer for you. I have swallowed so much BS that I have heartburn.

My only follow-up recommendation is to make sure your children hear from you that what she said is not okay and that will you always have their back, even if it involves family.", "NTA. I'm bigger because of genetics and not being able to eat as much as I actually needed when I was a child was hell and gas physically altered me forever. I had to go without eating so long and so much for the sake of \"controlling my portions\" that my body has literally stopped creating regular hunger signals. I have been to a dietitian before and they have straight up told me that even as an adult due to time blindness and my body failing to properly signal when I need food, the reason I'm overweight is not because I eat too much but because I eat too little. \n\nObviously don't overfeed them or let them go crazy, but if your kid says they need more food then it's good to trust them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
