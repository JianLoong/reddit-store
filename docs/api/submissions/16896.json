If she doesn't respect that boundary then off you go. It's one thing to want more freedom in a relationship and that's totally understandable, but when that freedom is to get coked up and sleep at random guys houses, then it's a problem. I'm sure if the tables were turned, she wouldn't be so happy with you.

See what her reaction is.", "YWNBTA for discussing your feelings about this with her.  That's what you're supposed to do, right?

If it\u2019s a trust thing then have that conversation but as far as I\u2019m concerned she didn\u2019t hide anything from you and had a great night with friends.", "NTA - sounds like a conversation is necessary and that you both present your expectations regarding the different facets of your relationship.", "NAH\n\nShe was transparent with you and you haven't indicated she crossed any boundaries you set up. Unless she's cheating on you (an actual possibility, but unless we have *some* evidence, then I'm assuming for now that she didn't) then she's not an asshole.\n\nHowever, it's also not shitty of you to be a bit upset and concerned that she's acting out of character and engaging in behaviour that could be harmful to her. To be clear: I don't have an objection to using coke, don't think it is always and everywhere self-destructive, and think that folks should be able to make decisions for themselves about whether or not to engage in behaviour that has a risk of being dangerous. But I also don't object to folks saying \"I don't want to be with somebody who does coke and stays out all night\" (or who does base jumping, or wingsuit diving, etc.).\n\nIt would be an asshole move to get angry at her, I think, unless I'm missing some context. But it would NOT be an asshole move to say \"I don't want to be with somebody who does X, so if you want to be with me, then I expect you not to do X again, and if you can't you need to let me know so we can break up\" (so long as X wasn't something silly and entirely benign, but staying out all night doing blow is not entirely benign). And then, if it happens again, you'd be right to be mad, and should probably end the relationship. And if she says she can't or won't abide by your request, then break up amicably and there will continue to be NAH.\n\nThat all said, you may want to consider ending it anyway. Not as punishment, but because if she does this then she's likely to do it again, or at least want to and resent you for not being able to. It depends though, if it's a one-off or something she's growing out of and she had an increasingly-unusual desire to party but could hold off until she was older and urge went away (unlikely at 20, to be fair...), then maybe it's worth trying to move forward together.\n\nEDIT: Somebody else here mentioned something to the effect of her trying to push you away by doing things that she knows will likely upset you, but aren't explicitly a red line for you (so she doesn't have to feel like the bad guy). This is a real possibility, also consider this when making decisions going forward for your relationship.", "I want an update already! Can we have a man update, please?", "NAH. I mean, you do need to talk but she's not an asshole for choosing her own adventure. It sounds like you may have just learned some of your own boundaries.

It seems questionable that she didn't mention it previously, but perhaps she forgot. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. \n\n2.

I'd like to look at this as her being mature and safe, but if that is something that's problematic for you then yes, speak with her about it. \n\nOverall though, it appears from the outside that this is a somewhat toxic and insecure relationship.

Best of luck, I hope all works well for you both!", "NAH,  \n\n\nShe's being incredibly communicative. What more can you really ask for.

How you feel about it is valid to express- I see a lot of insecure responses in these comments and I hope you don't let those comments stoke an insecure and presumptuous response and topple your relationship. She could have slept at this person's house for the simple explanation that it was too late to comfortably get home. That does not equal sex. Has she been trying to avoid coke? Is it something you guys have talked about and resolved not to do? Even if you haven't had a talk like this, maybe you've just learned this makes you uncomfortable and that's something you should speak with her about. Seems like you might be feeling disregarded or left out. Those things should be fine to express in a relationship, just don't let the reactionary comments of strangers influence how you handle a situation they don't have the investment in or full context of. When you're talking to people for which cocaine usage is normal, making them feel weird about it usually just establishes instant distance and mistrust.

For me, I'd have a very, very difficult time believing this is what actually happened, but hell I don't know, maybe it did.

Add to that if someone is already exhausted than often what happens is they\u2019ll do a stimulant, crash and sleep a couple hours and suddenly pop awake not really feeling refreshed but feeling suddenly alert again.

That\u2019s true, it takes so little of it to be fatal. \u201cCost-saving\u201d meaning they sometimes secretly cut a bag of cocaine with fentanyl instead of having a bag of pure cocaine. To save money. Fentanyl is cheaper. & then tell lower level dealers / customers that it\u2019s pure cocaine to drive a good price.", "As someone in a successful long term relationship that relies not on that crap but on direct one to one communication with my partner, I can assert that you actually don't need that. The skill of communicating is much more vital, whereas relying on stereotypes will fail you in certain circumstances. \n\nAgain. You do you. It doesn't work that way for everyone.", "Doesn\u2019t seem like you actually know what the term \u201caddict\u201d means. I blame the schools.", "The frequency of usage is what constitutes addiction. If it impacts your normal life, that is addiction. Going to a festival and doing coke one day? Thats not addiction. When it becomes something that you CONSTANTLY do, be it weekly or daily, that is when it becomes addiction.", "Doing hard drugs once in a while doesn\u2019t make you an addict. I\u2019m definitely judging those that do it bc wtf, but I\u2019m also aware enough to know that doesn\u2019t make them an addict. Stupid & playing with fire? Yes, but not an addict.", "Yes it\u2019s totally an addictive lifestyle to use cocaine or any drug for that matter once a month, or on a special occasion. Drugs are used to ENHANCE the already fun time you\u2019re having. Why is it seen as normal to go out every weekend and get shitfaced on alcohol, but when you\u2019re using a drug once in a blue moon people like you get up in arms about it? I am a college student with a 3.9 GPA, a well paying job and a thriving investment portfolio. I have myself set up, and all my ducks are in a row. I workout every day and I\u2019m willing to bet that I\u2019m in better physical shape than you have ever been in the entirety of your miserable, judgmental life.", "You're actually the real AH in this thread btw\n\nHell, maybe even the whole sub today\n\nI would much rather be friends with an addict than friends with someone who has an attitude like yours. If your kids don't hate you yet I'm assuming it's because they're not old enough."]}
