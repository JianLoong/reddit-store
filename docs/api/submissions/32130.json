My father passed away a couple years before that.  After my dad died, I (39M) put in a lot of time and effort helping my mom.  My 2 younger siblings (35F & 32M) did not do much of anything to help after my dad's funeral.  They are both married and each have 2 kids.  I am single and have no kids, so I had the time to help my mom and I'm grateful for the time that allowed me to have with her.  \n\nMy parents owned a cabin on a lake that was built by my dad's father decades ago.  My dad and I spent a few years doing a bunch of renovations about a decade before he died.  We tore a lot of it down to the studs and rebuilt it.  My parents had to refinance their mortgage to do the work.  Before my mom died, she expressed her desire to leave the cabin to myself and my siblings, split 3 ways.  I told her that could cause some issues and be complicated financially.  But, the cabin was their largest asset and she wanted it to be split amongst the 3 of us.  \n\nAt first, my siblings were happy about the cabin being split between us.  Then, they realized that my parents still had a mortgage on the property after my mom died.  And that property taxes on lake property are incredibly expensive.  Since all 3 of our names were put on the title and mortgage, we are all legally liable for the mortgage and taxes.  And to put it simply, neither of my siblings are in a position to afford it.  Nor did my mom have enough money left to pay off the mortgage in a lump sum.  \n\nMy siblings have been pressuring me to sell the property.  I straight up refused because I literally have blood, sweat, and tears in that place.  They then suggested that I buy them out of their share so they aren't responsible financially.  I was open to the idea until they both said that they want to continue to bring their families there like they always have.  \n\nI told them that if I buy them out, the cabin is mine.  Not \"ours.\"  I told them if they want to bring their families there that they will need to clear it with me first.  I told them I would install a security system and change the locks as soon as the paperwork is signed.  I told them I would probably use it as a rental property and that they couldn't just use it whenever they want.  \n\nThey both got upset and told me I was being selfish and unreasonable.  We all have great memories of the cabin as kids and they want their kids to grow up building the same memories.  I told them as long as they clear it with me first, they can use it.  But it isn't going to be like it was when my parents owned it and they just showed up whenever they wanted.  \n\nThey both basically gave the similar versions of \"Won't you think of your nieces and nephews?  You're depriving them of amazing memories that we all had together.\"  They think I'm being petty and selfish.  Maybe I am.  But it's not my fault they can't afford it.  I miss my mom, but I wish I could tell her \"Told you so.\"  ", "created_utc": 1701466308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188n147/aita_for_refusing_to_sell_the_family_cabin_or_buy/", "score": 5324, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Neither of my siblings can afford it but I refuse to sell it.  They suggested me buying them out of their shares, but they don't want to agree to my terms.

You're saying that if you buy them out, then they need to respect the fact that it's your property and they can't use it freely any longer. Especially if you plan on using it for a rental property. That's not an unreasonable ask.\n\nBesides, if you all put it on the market and sold it to a stranger, they literally would not have ANY access to the property, so why all the drama from their end of things? \n\nThey really aren't looking at this logically. They don't want to bear the costs of the property (taxes, maintenance, mortgage); they want the cash they could receive from selling it, but if you're the one to purchase their shares, they still want free access and to act as if it is still family property?? Nah...that doesn't track at all. Talk about having a cake, eating it, and still trying to keep it all at the same time...sheesh!\n\nAnd so you don't have another gotcha moment with your siblings, OP. If you purchase the cabin and choose to make it a rental, make them rent it from you for some sort of nominal fee. If you allow them to use it 'with notice' I guarantee, they (or their kids as they get older) will absolutely trash the place when they are in use of it, leaving you holding the bag. Don't tell them about needing to rent the cabin from you until it's a done deal though.", "NTA. Your siblings can't afford to keep their shares so they have to sell them. Regardless of who owns the cabin afterwards (whether you or a complete stranger), your siblings will not have any rights to the cabin anymore. That's how sales work. You sell something, you get the money for it, and the item no longer belongs to you. It's a pretty simple concept. I don't know if they're really this obtuse, or of they're just trying to guilt you into taking all the financial responsibility and letting them enjoy the benefits. You're being more than generous  by offering them the use of the cabin if they just clear it with you first. I don't think I'd be so generous to entitled people.", "NTA\n\nOf course they should clear it with you since you\u2019ll own the house. \n\nA couple questions though:\n\n1. Are you buying them out at a fair market price? If yes, \ud83d\udcaf% your house, your rules.\n\n2. Would you charge them when they stay? If no, I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019d object. If yes, I can understand their frustration, but your rules are still fair.\n\nWe have a similar property in our family for generations with lots of childhood memories. Only 1 person owns it, but there\u2019s always been an understanding any direct relatives can use it as long as they coordinate schedules with the owner (who is usually there too). They wouldn\u2019t dream of charging us.", "They can't have it both ways.\n\nEither they partly own it and have to pay, but in return have access\n\nOR\n\nThey don't have to pay but don't have access.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n>They both got upset and told me I was being selfish and unreasonable. We all have great memories of the cabin as kids and they want their kids to grow up building the same memories.\n\nBut they wanted you to sell it. How does that work out?\n\nThey want things to continue as they have been: you do all the work, and they reap the rewards.", "NTA they want the use of the beach house but not the responsibility of ownership.", "NTA. They want no financial responsibility but still want to be able to use the property. If you had agreed to sell it, none of you would have had access whenever you wanted. \n\nIf they cared so much about their kids enjoying the cabin, they would figure out how to afford their third. Buy them out. Change the locks.", "NTA. They want to have their cake and eat it too. Sell it to you and get the money, but then still use it as if it's still theirs. If they sold it on the open market, they wouldn't still get to use it, so why do they think they still get to use it whenever they want once it's yours?\n\nMaybe approach this as, \"I can't comfortably afford to pay it off either if we just keep it for personal use, but if I rent it out, I can recoup some of the expenses. But I'm not opposed to letting you use it if you clear it with me first, so I do absolutely want to give your families a chance to enjoy it.\"\n\nI don't understand why they would balk at just getting it cleared by you first. Obviously it makes sense you'd need to rent it out sometimes, and they can't just show up if someone is renting it already that week. You're just asking them to make sure it's free on a week they want to use it. That's for their benefit. I mean, do they expect to just show up and kick out whoever's there already paying for it? That's crazy.\n\nHold firm. They want their money, they'll give in eventually. Don't agree to sell it to anyone else until they accept your very reasonable terms. They'll either have to bleed money every year for taxes or take your offer.\n\nEDIT: typo", "NTA. Why would they think that's ok to not make any payments but use it like they were. It would be so smart for you to rent it out! Just use it when it's not rented and the rent will likely pay your bills!", "NTA - If you bought out the siblings, it would be your cabin and your terms.  Probably could have saved yourself some trouble by telling them after the purchase.  Hindsight is 20/20 though.", "Nta\n\nSo they want to keep the privileges and 'ownership' without the financial hassle?\nThe entitlement.", "Nta if you own it, it's yours, not community property. Your terms are entirely reasonable.", "NTA\n\nAnd your siblings need to be paying their share of the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and maintenance until they sell their share of the property.", "So basically it\u2019s like they want to sell their car, but still be able to drive it whenever they want?! \n\nThe entitlement they want has a price tag: mortgage, maintenance and property taxes divided by 3. SMH\n\nYWNBTA", "\"They both got upset and told me I was being selfish and unreasonable.\"\n\nThey want continued use of the cabin after you purchase each of their shares in said cabin, *they* are the ones being selfish and unreasonable, NTA.", "What is wrong with you? /s\n\nThey want to have their cake and eat it too  how selfish and cruel of you not to fund the \u201ccabin\u201d dreams of your deadbeat siblings. /s\n\nFuck \u2018em and the entitled horse they rode in on. Stand your ground. \n\nNTA", "NTA - it sucks, but they can\u2019t have everything.", "NTA\n\nYou've got reason to want to hang on to the cabin, and they are unable to afford the finances of co-owning it. From what info you've provided, you've offered some reasonable allowances for them to still have access to the place.", "I have been in this exact situation. My dad and uncle owned a family property. It would have gotten messy passing down to cousins, so my dad fair market sold his half to my cousin.  She has the means, uses it, and has put significant labor into it. \n\nIf I want to use it, I ask first and pay her.", "NTA - you are doing nothing wrong.", "NTA.  You're being generous to take on the full financial burden and let them have conditional use.  Renting it out for vacationers is a great way to recoup the expenses, and could be done by the 3 just as easily as by yourself.", "NTA\n\nThis is a complicated situation, and one where it makes me think that sometimes, as unfair as it may seem, the rule of primogeniture makes sense, at least a bit. \n\nIn the case of land or estates or houses, leaving it to multiple people creates these exact issues. Breaking the estate apart into smaller pieces makes it unprofitable, and unsustainable in the long run. \n\nKeeping it intact means the property has enough revenue (via a rental income) to maintain itself and still be available to you, but it is only possible if all the siblings come to an agreement. \n\nINFO: What do they think of keeping it between the three of you but renting it out together? \n\nIf they don't want their names on the deed because they don't want the mortgage and taxes in their names, that's understandable. Too much debt in their names will make buying a house or car more difficult for them. \n\nBut if they don't want to be legally responsible for the cabin, then they need to understand that they waive their right to unfettered access to the cabin. They were onboard with selling the cabin and losing any access anyway. Why is it different now that YOU are the one buying it?", "NTA they have to choose if they want to keep it or they want to let it go, and commit to that decision. If they want free access to the cabin, they need to come up with the funds to be able to pay for it. If they want to sell the cabin, they wouldn't have had access to it anyways... \n\nHaving children doesn't entitle them to be freeloaders (a common misconception). If they don't want to deny their own children of these precious memories, they know what they need to do.", "NTA - They won't have free rights to it if you sell it to someone else, Why should they if they sell it to you?  They are being very selfish.", "Nta of course. Just tell them you'll buy out their portion and you'll figure out the rest later, and once you buy it change the locks. It'll be your property so no need to discuss it or clear it with them ahead of time. If they don't agree, put it on the market and talk to a different realtor about submitting an offer on it right away for the market price. At the end, the finaces will work out the same, pay off the mortgage and split the rest, except they'll get a little less money and you'll pay a little more to cover the realtors. That way, they don't even need to know you own it.", "NTA\n\nYour siblings want you to take over where your parents left off, providing free lodging in a location they love. You are quite right to feel like they are overstepping to insist that you buy them out *and* continue to make the place available on their schedules as if it is not your own place. Division of property issues sucks big time. Hopefully you'll be able to work things out with your siblings.", "NTA. \n\nthey want a cabin that they can use at their leisure. The great news is, there is one! They already own it! They will have to pay the bills to continue to own it, or sell it to someone else. \nLike all houses, if they sell it to another person, it will no longer be their cabin. \n\n\nIdk how tf they can\u2019t understand that. Yikes", "INFO: Where's the executer in all this? The \"estate\" will pay the tax bills and the mortgage until it runs out of money, then the assets have to be sold. You can't \"refuse\": it's not your property; it's the estate's.", "NTA\n\nYour siblings (politely) asking a discount for when they'd like to reserve and use your cabin is pretty normal for families/friends. But them expecting a fully free ride whenever they feel like it? No. They're taking it too far.", "Nta. They are acting sooo entitled.", "NTA - It feels like maybe we're seeing the intention you have, and your siblings aren't. I'm wondering if they heard \"rental\" and figured somebody would live there full time compared to say an  AirBNB situation. To me this feels like a communication error rather than an actual conflict. \n\nFor what it's worth you're offering something incredibly generous, especially if they can't afford to keep a financial stake in the property. Do everything you can to keep it in your family, it sounds like a super cool place with a ton of history.", "NTA\n\nThat's the one problem with having a vacation property.  Too many people think they are entitled to use it whenever they want.", "NTA originally they wanted you to sell it so they wouldn\u2019t have had access to it at all if you did.  Like did they believe they could still use it if it belonged to someone else. \n\nKeep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "NTA, they can take their bullshit to another farm. They want to upside of the cabin and an inheritance while you deal with the costs and upkeep. Selfish fuckers dont get to have their cake and eat it too.", "NTA. My grandpa left his beach apartment to his daughters, my mom and her two sisters. Since my mom pre-deceased him, it was split 1/9 for me and my two siblings and 1/3 to each of my aunts. One bought out the rest of us at a price set by an appraiser. She invited us to visit and stay, and/or we ask when is a good time to visit.\n\nFeelings were still hurt, though. But that\u2019s how it goes sometimes. I\u2019d rather not be figuring out day to day home-owning decisions with so many different people.", "NTA they're entitled", "NTA\n\nIf you buy them out you are taking on all the financial risk. The cabin will need to pay it's way. So renting it out as a holiday let is a must to pay the mortgage and the taxes.\n\nThe cabin would be yours to do with as you wish. If they want to use it they will have to book and pay like everyone else.", "NTA - no free lunch. If they want continue use, don\u2019t buy out. Once bought out, they have no say. Sounds very reasonable.", "NTA- your compromise is reasonable, the cabin stays in the family and they don\u2019t have to pay for it.\n\nThey\u2019re just being greedy at this point.\n\nStick to your guns on this.", "NTA  \n  \nThe three of you should rent it out to defer the costs.", "NTA - Your siblings want all the benefits of a cabin/lakehouse with none of the responsibilities or financial obligations.", "NTA.  If they want to be able to use it whenever like they own it, they can keep owning it.  If they want to sell it to you, it's yours and you can do whatever you want.", "NTA.\n\nno one, not even siblings, gets to freely reap the benefits of an asset if they decide to shed the burden of financial hardship. you are not their parent. furthermore, you invested actual physical labor, and if you buy them out, actual cash. you aren't even completely banning them from using the property. weaponizing their children to guilt trip you is, quite simply, trashy.", "NTA.\nYou did the work. They want the benefits of your work and bring nothing to the table\nIf they want their share of the property, they can pay one third of all the expenses associated with the property.\nOtherwise, they can go pound sand .\nIt's pretty amazing how the time changes when inherited  assets cost money to maintain.\nThen it's \" we/I want the cash\".\nI have a strategy.\nIf you have the funds, dangle pre written checks for nominal amounts in their faces. \nCall it \" get lost money\".", "NTA and I am confused.  If you buy them out then you don\u2019t need their permission for your terms.  Additionally, your siblings can do nothing, you pay the full mortgage and they stonewall you (I am inferring that would be the case) and they get the equity for free.\n\nYou should be jumping at the chance to buy them out and not discuss terms for afterwards.  If you won't sell and will pay the mortgage, your siblings are in the power position.", "Why don\u2019t you look into doing Airbnb enough to pay off the monthly mortgage/taxes and then split up the remaining weeks evenly between the three of you?", "LMAAAAOOO, NTA, so they want to pay nothing and still enjoy it like its theirs.", "NTA. They want a payday without giving up anything. That\u2019s unrealistic.", "What if you continue to keep it as a shared property and rent it?  You all share in the profit as well as the expenses.  Each of you gets to book 1? 2? weeks per year*, the rest of the time it\u2019s a rental.  The profits will offset the costs and the difference may be doable.  This may still not be financially feasible but worth looking into.  \n\n*bonus: to maximize time at the cabin, 2 or 3 families go together!", "You know your siblings can hire lawyers and force you to sell the cabin right because there is two of them and one of you? \n\nYour deal doesn\u2019t sound unreasonable, but if I was in there shoes I would force a sale. NTA", "you're NTA but you know they can force a partition sale right? And while you all three may be on the hook for the mortgage and taxes, you can't force them to pay their share and will still lose the property if you don't pay it yourself? I'm not saying you have to give into their demands on availability but you gotta know a quick resolution is likely the best scenario if you want to keep it.", "NTA, this is exactly why I laughed at one of my cousins years ago when he said all of us (13) grandchildren purchase my grandfather's lake property after he died. Thankfully a beautiful couple bought it.", "NTA. If they want unlimited access, they can pay their fair share. Otherwise, they can schedule time through you and be grateful you're not charging them rent when they go.", "So, they want their share of the Moberly from the cabin AND the cabin simultaneously, with you footing the bill? NTA", "NTA but contingent on if you are just buying the mortgage or fair market value.  If just the mortgage, then fair would be to work out when they want the cabin and block that time off say 8 weeks (4 each) and you can rent it the rest of the time. But they get first pick of when and no complaints if it\u2019s when it pays the most to rent it out.", "NTA. \n\nThis is called 'having your cake and eating it\" - they don't want / can't afford the financial responsibility but still want to enjoy it as though they had (part) ownership of it.

That\u2019s laughable.", "NTA. They were happy to sell it to someone else and never go there again. So now if your the one who buys it they want full access. Renting it out might be a way for them to afford their share, but they still would have to plan ahead to use it. Your terms are reasonable and they can't have it all their way.", "NTA, this is why I really hope my MIL/FIL sell their cabin before they go. It\u2019s already getting to be such a sensitive topic. Two of the adult kids want to keep the cabin at all costs even though they can\u2019t afford it. And the other two (my husband is here) want to see it sold before it causes problems. It was bought and built for $30k back in the 80s now it\u2019s around a million dollars. It\u2019s the kind of money that causes people to lose their damn minds. I want to see it sold and then I would thoroughly enjoy watching them live their best life in retirement. But they won\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s the family cabin and they feel bad.

Wow, your siblings sound like entitled jerks. They want you to pay them money for their part of the cabin and still be able to use it whenever they want. That is not logical in any sense of the word or imagination. If you buy them out that cabin is yours and yours alone, and they have to follow whatever rules you put into place. If they want to continue using it like they do now then they have to figure out how to pay their portion of the mortgage and the taxes it\u2019s a simple as that.

Can you put it in the market and buy it?", "NTA But it sounds like there are some other family dynamics at play here. Do you otherwise have a good relationship with your siblings? Your response indicates that there are potentially some trust issues between the three of you (security system and changing the locks), so if there aren't, I think that your response (while still not the asshole) was a little harsh out of the gate.

The siblings can probably insist legally on the cabin being put on the open market to determine the price. If this does not happen, they may feel that they are being paid less than the true market value, and are entitled to some compensation for this like access to the cabin. If you refuse to sell, they can go to court to force a partition sale. If you try to sell to yourself, you will have difficulty complying with laws on self-dealing unless the siblings agree or you put it on the open market to determine the price.", "NTA. I'd say NAH but your siblings appear a little entitled considering how reasonable your expectations are.", "NTA\n\nThe interesting thing that sometimes happens when one person owns a property that was used by multiple family members is the non-owners suddenly don\u2019t give a flying fig about treating the property with care.  \n\nElectronics get broken, unnecessary messes are left for the owner/cleaning crew to deal with, outside amenities are misused, etc and the owner is expected to just suck it up.  \n\nSimilar attitude some people have when renting a car.  \n\nOP wish you could tell your mom \u2018I told you\u2019 too but I suspect she knew it would likely turn out this way. \n\nIf at all possible I\u2019d definitely buy out your siblings and make sure there is nothing buried in the paperwork that grants them any sort of access to the property.  \n\nOnce bought I\u2019d change all the locks both on the house and any out buildings.  I\u2019d also install exterior cameras covering entrances, driveway, outbuildings, etc. that notify you immediately when they are activated.  Be sure you visit with the local police so they are aware the property will be rented out and you are now the owner. Also what number to contact if you do have an issue with trespassers or if police have issues with renters. . \n\nThere have been previous posts where underage nephews broke into their uncle\u2019s lake house to have a party.  \n\nAnother post was recently updated when one sibling owned the lake house that he let his parents use as they wanted.  His sisters who thought the parents owned it were shocked when the parents had enough of issues with letting the sisters and their families use the cabin so owning sibling told them no more access.  The 3 brother-in-laws for whatever reason decided to break into the house for whatever reason.

My father passed away a couple years before that.  After my dad died, I (39M) put in a lot of time and effort helping my mom.  My 2 younger siblings (35F & 32M) did not do much of anything to help after my dad's funeral.  They are both married and each have 2 kids.  I am single and have no kids, so I had the time to help my mom and I'm grateful for the time that allowed me to have with her.  \n\nMy parents owned a cabin on a lake that was built by my dad's father decades ago.  My dad and I spent a few years doing a bunch of renovations about a decade before he died.  We tore a lot of it down to the studs and rebuilt it.  My parents had to refinance their mortgage to do the work.  Before my mom died, she expressed her desire to leave the cabin to myself and my siblings, split 3 ways.  I told her that could cause some issues and be complicated financially.  But, the cabin was their largest asset and she wanted it to be split amongst the 3 of us.  \n\nAt first, my siblings were happy about the cabin being split between us.  Then, they realized that my parents still had a mortgage on the property after my mom died.  And that property taxes on lake property are incredibly expensive.  Since all 3 of our names were put on the title and mortgage, we are all legally liable for the mortgage and taxes.  And to put it simply, neither of my siblings are in a position to afford it.  Nor did my mom have enough money left to pay off the mortgage in a lump sum.  \n\nMy siblings have been pressuring me to sell the property.  I straight up refused because I literally have blood, sweat, and tears in that place.  They then suggested that I buy them out of their share so they aren't responsible financially.  I was open to the idea until they both said that they want to continue to bring their families there like they always have.  \n\nI told them that if I buy them out, the cabin is mine.  Not \"ours.\"  I told them if they want to bring their families there that they will need to clear it with me first.  I told them I would install a security system and change the locks as soon as the paperwork is signed.  I told them I would probably use it as a rental property and that they couldn't just use it whenever they want.  \n\nThey both got upset and told me I was being selfish and unreasonable.  We all have great memories of the cabin as kids and they want their kids to grow up building the same memories.  I told them as long as they clear it with me first, they can use it.  But it isn't going to be like it was when my parents owned it and they just showed up whenever they wanted.  \n\nThey both basically gave the similar versions of \"Won't you think of your nieces and nephews?  You're depriving them of amazing memories that we all had together.\"  They think I'm being petty and selfish.  Maybe I am.  But it's not my fault they can't afford it.  I miss my mom, but I wish I could tell her \"Told you so.\"  \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A higher amount where they forego ever going there again.  Basically, it's like the house you live in:  they can visit you once in a while, but that's it.  You would never \"loan\" your house to them, and it's the same for the cabin.  **Agreement is if you take the higher amount, you basically never go there again**.\n2. A lower amount where they each get, say, two weeks each year (or whatever), for as long as you own it.  Be explicit on the rules (ie, \"you were there for a day, so I thought it wouldn't count\" or \"who gets memorial day\", \"I broke the boat lift, who pays\" BS).  And write them down.  If you take the lower amount, you get these rights for 2 weeks each year, but that's it.  no more.  And no, you can't lend it to friends.\n\nSo let's say it's a $600K property (to make the math easy), they can get market value of $200K, and never go again, or they can accept $150K and have it 2 weeks each summer (or whatever).", "NTA. Your reasons, and options given are reasonable. \n\nHowever, are you prepared to cover the mortgage in full every month if they can't and aren't willing to let you buy them out?

Instead of buying them outright, you 3 could split the equity as a share of the cabin. You pick up the mortgage and taxes and therefore own the remaining share of the cabin.

Then they'll leave it alone thinking it sold to a random person's trust, and you own it and can do as you please.", "> Logic is not a strong suit for either of them. \n\nApparently it wasn\u2019t for your mother, either, or she would have foreseen this. Maybe she expected y\u2019all to act like a family to keep it in the family. But she certainly wanted your siblings and niblings to enjoy it, too. So what you really need to decide is are you TA if you go against what your mother wanted?", "Realize that this will end any relationship you have with them and also they can legally force a sell through the courts.", "If your siblings want a breakdown on how well not using logic works. \n\nMy dad, aunt, and uncle sold the family cabin because my aunt is petty and illogical over shit that wasn\u2019t her business. \n\nIn the end No one is really talking to each other anymore because of it and it\u2019s completely torn apart the family, including my parents and my sibling. They\u2019re no longer talking.", "Can you see how often they actually used the cabin and tell them you will have that time marked off (eg two weeks in summer and two in winter each or whatever) guarantee each year? Would something like that hush them over?", "> No, I wouldn't charge them to use the property.\n\nI would rethink that. If they're not paying anything, they're going to feel more entitled to everything. That leaves you on the hook if anything gets broken.\n\nIt wouldn't have to be a lot, but I would charge a somewhat-below market value, and have a contract written up. They may actually respect the property, then.", "I call this 'The Position' in the family ..... And it can be any child in the mix: first, middle, last, step, half, full, borrowed, ANY of them can be in 'The Position'.      Families are more complicated than birth order, people are more complicated than birth order.    But we can all agree that 'The Position' in the family SUCKS !!    Responsible for everything, gets no respect or acknowledgement, emotional or mental health needs are irrelevant, but must always be available for everyone for everything or you are the one ruining things when you can't or don't want to bail them out of another mess as it negatively impacts your life which they don't account for as much as their lives and wants and whines and 'neeeeeds'.     Ugh.      'The Position'.", "I would be inclined to ask them that if the situation were reversed, i.e., If they were in your position, how would they handle it?\n\nWould they grant you and your other sibling full access to the property, considering they had paid all the taxes, and assumed ownership? Would you be able to go up there whenever you wanted?\n\nI understand where they're coming from to some extent, but they want to have their cake and eat it too. Either they can afford to use the place or they can't.\n\nIt's worth having an unemotional, adult conversation. I have seen more families fall apart after the parents pass away, and seen so many siblings fall out why it doesn't necessarily have to be that way.\n\nOnly you can decide which is more important, a property that has been in the family for so long or your relationship with your siblings.", "I remember reading an experience someone had essentially this happened with, though I just can't remember if it was on here or not.\n\nPerson's father left him and his siblings two options on inheritance when he died: either inherit stocks he owned, or cash. Something like that. The main person here chose the stock option whereas the siblings chose the money, which they all blew through pretty fast on things like cars and such.\n\nTime goes on and the stocks go up a significant amount, netting him a lot of money. And wouldn't you just know it, the siblings were all about how *they* deserved some of the money too.\n\nSo you could very well be right!", "Cleaning! Dont leave that out!", "I knew a girl who's family tried that. 3 young couples bought a lake house. Rented it when they weren't using it. Within the year I heard her talking of selling. Apparently one of the couples was taking money out of the joint lake house bank account without anyone else's permission.", "Right?   If they are going to use it for free for even one week a year, they should be doing a maintenance task while there and buying something to contribute.   If nothing else, there's utilities and grass cutting, etc.", "It\u2019s not the pill that works both ways, this seems like a great deal for the siblings", "That would work for all of 2 days when he posts a picture of himself there or has mutual friends come up. The siblings would definitely find out if he went your sneaky route", "Exactly my point. Owning a cabin is not free, even if there is no mortgage. There is taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs... No way I would let my siblings use it for free if I were OP. They would be paying at cost per night it is used (taking into consideration that such places are often only used during the summer months).\n\nOP is making them a very generous offer.", "THIS IS THE ANSWER. They want the benefit of the cabin without having to pay for it but are FINE if you pay as long as their benefits don't change.  \n\nNope.  At some point, if you want a relationship with them (tho not sure why you would), you will just need to sell it to a third party as they are never going to let it go.", "Like his entitled siblings would ever agree to OP getting a fee for running the property leaving them with less money to split", "It\u2019s not a bad idea but who would manage the rentals ? Even if hired a management and cleaning company . Someone still has to do that work of coordinating and working with them. My guess is it would be OP doing all that. He does all the work and then the benefits are split three ways. That sucks.  \n\nHis idea of buying them out and allowing their families to plan vacations there is the fairest way.", "I\u2019m the oldest and the only daughter.  I\u2019m low key hoping an accident takes me out before the caretaker years get here.", "I'm the youngest of two and my sisters shit didn't stink if you know what I'm saying. I always have felt like the fuck up of the family even though I got less opportunity's than my older sister, but I can't ever mention that little fact.", "hear hear, sister.", "I call it the designated driver. 'Twas I,  of course.", "Me as the middle child. I'm the only one of my siblings to have never been arrested, so all responsibility has always fallen to me \ud83d\ude44", "I'm the youngest too and I'm the one who looks after mom, pays for my mom's care, and holds the family together. Before our dad died I paid his bills and looked after him too. My sister barely does anything when she visits.", "If he asks the siblings, OF COURSE they're gonna say they would share and all that...they wouldn't, I'm sure, but they'd CLAIM to be that magnanimous.  Yeah, OP is definitely NTA.", "LOL, mommy and daddy agreed to it, so it should be that way FOREVER no matter who owns it. /s", "I love the story of the Little Red Hen. An allegory for many situations.", "The key is to have a lawyer form the LLC in the lawyer's name as registered agent and use their address. OP can be owner/operator but isn't on record as owner of the LLC.", "Genteel poverty is my go to", "How could it have been avoided? \n\nI'm with Sad Rush here. The only options are splitting it between the three, selling it to a third party, or disinheriting two out of three. No good options for mom.", "I had a childhood friend that had grandparents that owned a cabin. There were 4 work days each year and if the family members (kids, grandkids, nieces, nephews, etc.) wanted to use the cabin they got 3 nights per work day attended. If you did all 4, you got use of the cabin for 2 weeks. Summer was fire clearance/outdoor maintenance. Fall was wood cutting and splitting. Winter was grading and repairing the driveway. Spring was deep cleaning the inside and tree trimming.", "I think you're being very generous", "This right here", "That's how it's been all along, so why should that suddenly change just because the owners died. Anyone with an ounce of common sense should be able to work it out, but a lifetime of being spoiled can mess up one's perspective on these things.", "He may be sneaky but at least he doesn\u2019t think he is entitled to have unconditional use of something that isn\u2019t his. And since he won\u2019t give them open access if they can\u2019t have it his siblings are going to make sure neither can he.\n\n\nOp tried to be open and honest and the siblings tried to screw him over.", "Sell it to a 3rd party and cut your losses. The siblings will be insufferable about wanting access to the cabin constantly, never contribute anything, and kick up a stink any time that OP actually tries to use their own damn cabin. \n\nGet out before it all goes to hell", "There are lots of rental management companies that take care of that for a fee. \n\nI agree the siblings are acting entitled but he might actually want to have a relationship with them and their kids. Maybe the kids will turn out better than the parents. I think going scorched earth right after a parent dies sounds like an awful idea", "\n>Then, surprise! Tell his sibs that he owns the LLC that owns the cabin.\n\nwhat? why would he do that?\n\njust do whatever he wants with the property his company owns and don't tell the ungrateful siblings", "Can you explain how this works? I have a Grandma that moved into assisted living recently in June. There\u2019s about 200 acre cabin she wants to keep in the family. My Aunt will be the acting executor when Grandma passes. Apparently the cabin is already set up as an LLC & apparently there are 10 members of this LLC - aunt, uncle, my Dad, myself, rest of my cousins. Aunt says that any members can be bought out of their share if they want to sell out of the LLC. It\u2019s hard to wrap my head around.", "So for two years, your mom was paying for a care home and all the expenses related to this cabin?  Is there enough left in her estate to cover the property bills now?", "But it\u2019s not sneaky or underhanded to do with YOUR property what you want.  The problem here is they want ownership without any of the ownership problems and costs.", "I'm going to tell you this in case nobody else does: you don't have to take care of your parents. You can do whatever you want with your life. You control how much contact you have with and the amount of resources you give to your family.", "You could always do like I did, and move to another country.", "You can and should", "My sisters and I all were in some form of LE, so we were never arrested, either.", "Thank you! Same here! Only thing I didn't do was take care of dad, but I took care of stepdad. I was alone with him when he died. I was 17.", "The Little Red Hen is a great parable. But I don't get what Ronald Reagan has to do with it?", "Elite", "They didn\u2019t try to screw him over. Nothing is official yet, so nothing has happened between them. Why are you so ready to fight? Weird", "You each own a % of the LLC, which in turn owns the cabin. Similar to stock in a corporation. You could buy shares of Coke, for instance, which owns plants etc. You can sell your ownership in the LLC like you sell shares of stock.", "Right?

Please.", ">If it\u2019s a firm It won\u2019t be completely free for pro-bono cases their fee would be capped or a set percentage of the sale of the property\n\nAre you confusing contingency and pro bono?\n\nI don't know of a state that would allow a pro bono lawyer to get fees from the sale of a property. \n\nYou just explained a lawyer working on contingency. In which case they are even less likely to take a case like this", "Haha I think you're hilarious for what it's worth!", "No one had disputed the definition. It's the application where you're having problems. \n \nBut you can be wrong, I don't have any more time to waste on an argument with someone who is asserting false information about a country they don't reside in and somehow thinks this is an inheritance case.  \n\nEnjoy your evening."]}
