I\u2019ll get right into it. I (22F) have a twin, \u201cMark\u201d (22M) and an older sister \u201cRiley\u201d (25F). Mark and I\u2019s relationships with Riley have always been strained, as she was rather resentful of us (especially me) growing up. My mother says that this is because when Mark and I were born, people would always express more interest in us than Riley, since we were twin babies. She hasn\u2019t explained why Riley seemingly never got over this, but I digress. \n\nRecently, all three of us were visiting my parents over the holidays. While there, my mom commented on how proud she was of all of us. Mark and I thanked her, but Riley countered this by saying, \u201cI should be the proud one. I basically raised them.\u201d We were all taken aback by this, and asked Riley to explain what she meant. \n\nSome backstory: my mom worked part time when we were kids, and while she was working her parents (my grandparents) would babysit all three of us. As we grew older, my mom never once asked Riley to babysit Mark and I (this would\u2019ve been difficult anyways, given the not-huge age gap). She always hired a sitter if my grandparents weren\u2019t available, even when Riley told her that she was too old to be babysat. We all split chores evenly, and my parents or I cooked dinner every night. \n\nRiley followed up her claim by saying \u201cI always was in charge of driving them places. School, our sporting events, everywhere. That was completely unfair to me - people now call that parentification. So, I\u2019m the one that should be proud.\u201d\n\nI laughed and said \u201cParentification is when the oldest sibling is given the role of a parent. Yes, you drove us to school - the same school that you went to! You only drove us to sporting events when you were also participating in them! If you recall, you literally never drove us anywhere that you weren\u2019t already going yourself. You were never parentified - and the fact that you think you were shows how awful of a sister you really are.\u201d\n\nAITA? I didn\u2019t think I was, but now Riley is pissed at me. She told me I had no idea what it\u2019s like to have to drive to school with your younger siblings, and to be honest, she\u2019s right. My mom didn\u2019t comment, but she did say that I shouldn\u2019t have engaged with her comment, so I\u2019m feeling like maybe I am TA.\n\nEdit: Since some are speculating about other underlying issues/difficulties that Riley may have, I feel that in all fairness I should include that Riley has a semi-complicated relationship with our mom, for reasons unrelated to my brother and I (mostly concerning her weight/my mom\u2019s privy to diet culture) - it\u2019s possible that this comment was a way of her getting back at my mom.\n\nEDIT 2: For those that are asking, yes my mom also made comments about my weight when I was younger (I was a chubbier kid/middle schooler). Ask I became a teen I \u201cthinned out\u201d (had a borderline ED), and she reversed her comments to telling me that I was too skinny and \u201cneeded to gain weight, or else\u2026\u201d . Later on, my sister would also make fun of me for being skinny, and try to force me to eat junk food so I would \u201cfatten up.\u201d\n\nFINAL EDIT: Wow, this blew up! I appreciate all of the thoughts and advice. As you can probably tell, my sister and I don\u2019t have the best relationship (for multiple reasons). I\u2019ve never had a conversation with her about either of our experiences with my mom, especially those concerning weight - this has made me want to do that. Even if the verdict is that I\u2019m not TA, I feel bad for calling her awful and want to apologize anyways.

I got my license and a car and I *was* expected to drop my siblings off at their activities, which at the time felt massively unfair, but in hindsight was really a small task that I could normally schedule my social life around. Sometimes I had to cook, when I got a job I was expected to pay board. Sometimes I *did* have to do \"parent\" jobs, like making sure homework was done or talking to teachers, but I wasn't responsible for those things.\n\nNothing that I did was *raising* them, it was helping my mum.

In my early 20s I resented having to help my mum, but now I recognise that I did have other options, I just didn't like the ramifications of not helping out. \n\nRiley wasn't parentified, she's feeling resentful of being expected to help her siblings growing up and is equating herself with being abused for a fairly normal family dynamic.

So having your older child \"watch\" their younger siblings after school; not parentification, they're already going to be home, they're just able to dial 911 a bit better. Having an older child reheat a dinner that was previously made; not parentification, again, they're already going to be feeding themselves, they just need to heat up more food....Forcing your child to quit an after school activity to watch their younger siblings, holding your child accountable for their younger siblings actions, making your child fund their siblings activities etc....these are parentification.", "NTA.

Now I completely understand the contempt some of them must feel who have experienced parentification, as in they raise children they didn't have. But people like Riley are just incredibly entitled. I think it comes from a place of being the only child and getting all the attention and everything is about them to it no longer being that way. Now they have siblings who they believe are favored but in reality they simply require extra care because they're babies.\n\nMy mom is one of these people. She has two younger siblings, 5 and 7 years younger than her. She always complains about how her parents were so strict with her and her siblings had it so easy. But honestly my mom was just a really rebellious kid while my aunt and uncle have always been mild mannered, so yeah it makes sense that my mom was disciplined more. And from the stories I heard, I think my mom just exhausted them to their wits end.\n\nMy husband on the other hand LOVES being an older brother, and because of that, him and his lil bro have a great relationship. His lil bro looks up to him so much and always asks him for advice and what not. Sure my husband acknowledges that his dad is easier on his brother than he was with him, but also acknowledges the large age difference and that his dad is just older and has less energy now. But instead of being resentful and jealous, my husband has gone out of his way to toughen his brother up in tough love kind of way that his brother appreciates. It's the same situation as my mom but, he's choosing to take a different approach by embracing the older sibling role instead of being made a victim by it.", "Social worker here! You're right that parentification is when a child is given responsibilities similar to a parent. Other examples include expecting a child to wake up their siblings and getting them ready for school (bathed, dressed, and fed), watching them on a regular basis for extended periods of time, and working to provide for the family. \nIt sounds like she's hurt by something though. Maybe it's just the driving, maybe it's jealousy that you guys were given more attention when you guys were little; I don't know, I'm not there.

Could've been worse, could've been better.", "Info: did she ever have to do chores for you two? Like wash your clothes or was responsible for helping you clean your rooms?

You walk the kilometre and a half home from school and wash whatever dishes that were made while you were at school.

I sure as hell got mad about it at the time!  But part of growing up is realizing your parents are just people who deserve a little bit of grace, and I think that goes double if you're the eldest - before you they'd never done it before, and after you they had.  Of course their rules and approaches changed with experience.", "Good question - she never did chores for us. We were never late to school on behalf of my brother or I, we were occasionally all late when she was running behind in the mornings, which made my parents upset - not sure if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking though.", "Look as a twin that was actually parentified I am going to outright say Riley was 100% **not** parentified. I watched my siblings, I made food for them, made sure they were ok, brought up issues at school to my parents if they had any, bore some of my mothers issues with my father, tried to keep the fam together when my dad was being abusive etc... all while dealing with my own issues and needing my mom who tried her best but damn we weren't really ok. All that and I still honestly didn't have it as bad as others.\n\nRiley didn't even babysit her siblings?? She just drove to them to school and events she was already going to, that's just convenience. All Riley has is some made up problems she has with her brothers that she needs to go see a therapist about.", "yes bc famously parents' only role is to drive people places. she is not a victim of anything at all and is being entitled. My own sister genuinely had to cook fo the family, clean the whole house, and babysit 2 younger sisters in place of my dad, and had to be there when he wasnt. For YEARS. THAT is parentification. \"riley\" is entirely wrong", "What do you see as an example of parentification in the OP\u2019s post, specifically?", "Yes, parents should cater to their children 24/7 and never give them chores or any responsibilities at all. That\u2019s how to raise competent adults and productive members of society. \n\nOh wait, it\u2019s not.", "How so? She was never forced to babysit. She wasn't forced to do their chores for them. I'm betting the car she used when she drove HERSELF and her siblings to school in was both bought and insured by the parents.  Parentification would have been not being allowed to participate in sports, attend afterschool events, or hang out with friends because she had to take care of her younger siblings,  It would be being left in charge of getting them up, feeding them breakfast, making sure they got dressed before school, etc. every morning or almost every morning and/or being responsible for them after school- feeding them a snack, helping them with homework, making them dinner, etc every day or almost every day.  Using your parent's car to drive them to school and events that you are already attending is not parentification.  Resenting them because you are jealous is a YOU problem, not parentification.  And just so you know, I am the older sibling of twins and I was never jealous of them.  Quite the contrary, I was happy I wasn't a twin because they were always lumped together, matching outfits, and expected to like the same things because they were twins while I was free to be me.+", "What?", "Her truth is being an entitled brat.", "No. Her truth cannot conflict with reality and becomes a problem when it is a negative statement of others. \n\nHer truth can be that she hated driving them around and she wishes she refused or something else.

I got in trouble a lot for what my brother did because it was my responsibility to look after him and make sure he did what he was supposed to.", "I don't know, I see a lot of people on AITA misusing terms like parentification all the time.  All it would take would be for the sister to learn the word and mistakenly think it applied to her.", "NAH except your mom.  Based on your edit, she fat shamed your sister and never did so to you.  She showed off her twins like a trophy, so yes, she probably is jealous.  Remember, no 2 kids have the same childhood even in the same home.  There are kids that are abused and assaulted while their siblings were left unscathed.\n\nThis is childhood trauma, so while no, your sister was not subjected to parentification, she was mistreated by your mother.  Yes, she is lashing out to your mom and honestly, your mom probably deserves it.\n\nYou should sit down with your sister and really really listen to what she has to say, her memories and what she endured might suprise you.", "NTA at all.\n\nWhat on earth is your sisters problem? You got in her car to hitch a ride to the same high school she went to and she\u2019s calling it parentification? One of my pals was parentified VERY badly.

The eldest siblings always have more responsibilities and they do take care of the younger siblings. Maybe she's exaggerating but you're not in her shoes to know this. I have 3 step kids and they were 7, 4 and 3 when I met them. The 7 year old was way more responsible for the younger 2 in ways you wouldn't believe. Yes there were baby sitters and grandparents but her being only 7 was the one that was responsible for them. If the 2 younger didn't do what they were supposed to or got into something they weren't supposed to, the 7 year old was to blame. It was horrible for her and coming into the family I would try to take that responsibility away but it was ingrained into her at such a young age and the younger 2 relied on her for everything.\n\nSo show some thankfulness and apologize.

You\u2019re going to understand your parents are regular smegular humans who fuck up, and you\u2019re going to understand that a great many of the things that feel personal simply aren\u2019t.

Sure, I didn\u2019t need to do it, also my parents didn\u2019t need to provide me with a car so you know. I never thought twice about it. I never missed out on school activities etc. I think most reasonable people can see helping out your family. If my sister was attending high school at the same time as me and I definitely did want to drive myself I definitely would have been required to take her, otherwise my mum isn\u2019t wasting her time taking her separately.

If she has a difficult relationship with your mom, it DOES have something to do with you. Families are a system, everyone gets slotted into roles, no one is isolated. For example,  as you get older you may want to consider if perhaps Riley was scapegoat and you are your brother were golden children. So while Riley's specific complaint may be factually invalid,  her underlying emotions -that she has more pressure and was less valued than you and your siblings for whatever  reason- may be valid. \n\nAs you become adults, its important to decide what kind of adult relationship you want to have with your siblings, beyond  the roles that were given to you in childhood, and beyond your parents' version of the truth. If you give up the attachment to the specific fight and go go more deeply into listening to Riley's feelings from love, you may be able to find a breakthrough. Even if you find out that she has a raging case of sibling rivalry  and there is no toxicity, you can lead with emotional generosity to help Riley get out of her feelings of scarcity.

The presence of the sitter (family or not) didn't change the fact that every adult in our life expected me to take responsibility for myself and my sibling regardless of the nuance(s) of the situation. \n\nIt didn't matter that I was 3 and they were 2ish, I should have blah blah blah. \"You're the eldest, so if they act out, you have to get them together.\" \"Why can't you show them how to do that?\" \"My pregnancy with her was rough, the labor lasted 26 hrs, and the doctors lost us both for a bit. By the next one walked out!\" \"You can't do that/have that unless your sibling can as well\"\n\nMy sibling was unaware of most of these exchanges except whenever I was held responsible for their childish behaviour.\n\nIt never mattered that I was also too young to understand, or perform. They just wanted compliance, and I had just enough sense taking in the demands with little \"correction\".\n\nThese conditions bred resentment between us which coloured how I experience very normal teenage experiences like being the only one with a license, thus the one driving them around. It also blinded me to my parent's and community's culpability in the issue because after awhile I figured it actually was my responsibility to to everything for them, and \"lead\".\n\nIt wasn't until my sibling and I reached our late 20s, sat down, and hashed it out that we realized we were played against each other for the convenience of our parents. That isn't to say our parents were terrible people, but they decided on the path of least resistance for them, and in turn, \"doubled it and passed it on\".\n\nFor eldest daughters in particular it is common to find yourself in the \"Mommy's little assistant role\" once more children come. In my experience, too few parents ever let that girl out grow that role, they just adapt it to suit their changing needs. Which fully bastardizes naturally protective feelings she has for her juniors.\n\nNTA for being conflicted about this OP, and neither is Riley. You and your siblings are just running up on one of the harder facets of the idea \"parents are people too\".

What he failed to see was I had the consistent chores.

And the *last* time my mom teased her about the comment, I stopped her and said just that, defending my sister.

I had been letting him hang out with me and sleep with me in my room because he'd lost his rabbit recently and it was super traumatizing for him.

I am the golden child because I did not have to make this choice (the fact that I played 0 sports is irrelevant, apparently). Therapy speak has been completely co-opted", "Things are much better now. It was definitely a journey though. I was lucky enough to have a close friend whose parents were amazing people. They are pretty well-off and took me in when I ran away at 16, almost 17. When my mom threatened them with legal action to get me back, my friend's dad was basically like, \"sure, go ahead and do that, but just so you know whatever two bit lawyer you get is going to have nothing on the lawyer we will hire for her. We're fighting for her. End of story.\"\n\nThey got me into public school for my senior year so I could at least graduate high school. Got me all my documents, birth certificate, social security card, etc. I really don't know what I would have done without them.", "NTA yes there are two sides to everything but this just sounds like she hasn\u2019t grown up.", "NTA. My Sister got away with not driving me to school, because it was walking distance. But now my 86 Mom has told me that she absolutely refuses to drive anywhere with anyone else BUT me as I OWE her for driving me around all over the place as a kid!\n\nShe and her sister were only two years apart, but to talk to them it is clear they had different Mom's and apparently were raised on different planets, perhaps even from different dimensions. So, there's that. My Mom is a narcissist and didn't get her fondest wish...to be an only child. She was the first girl in a generation. Her family showered her with clothes and gifts...until her darned sister was born.\n\nNobody can speak another person's truth...especially if it's a lie and even if they know that.", "She would have freaked out during covid. My kids were 9-11-13 when lockdown happened and had to stay home together while husband and I worked out ass off in the hospital. Of course the older two were \u00ab\u00a0responsible\u00a0\u00bb for the youngest, but they never saw it as a chore. They love each others and doing things for each others is just the natural path for them. \n\nBut I have to admit, I had it so easy with them. They are natural BFF and barely had an argument in years. I am spoiled with good natured kids. \n\nAnyway, NTA. Riding with your sibling to school is not parentification.", "When I turned 16 I also got a (paid for) car with the understanding I was responsible for shuttling my 14 at the time sister around at my parent's convenience - even if it wasn't somewhere I was already going. That's not parentification - that's participation in a family and the cost of getting a car at 16.", "I feel like this is a very uncharitable take. OP has commented that their mom took the older sister to Weight Watchers when she was only 13: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jlv88/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_wasnt_a_victim_of/jb3raqh/?context=3\n\nThat's a really awful thing to do to your kid. /u/CobraPuts is right on the money that something else was up.", "Likewise. I had working parents. When I got older I used to kid my mom about our age gaps, so that she didn't have to be the sole chauffeur for the sports and hobbies the sibs were into. In fact, I think that's why I got a car, otherwise me going to work was going to add to the time cluster. I too thought it was what families did. I was the oldest, but most of my friends were the youngest, and their older sibs were often the ride.", "Same. My parents worked hard to give us everything we needed, a holiday once a year. In hindsight it wasn\u2019t hard to help out starting dinner a couple of days a week when I was home from school by 4pm & ferrying my siblings around on occasion", "I had a very similar childhood too but public school thankfully which was my escape. My friends would call me cinderella because home life was rough for me and I started working around 14/15. They didn't feed me either at home which ugh why??? Thankfully my friend's parents knew how it was and helped me as much as they could.", "\ud83d\ude4f", "You know the person you answered was being sarcastic right?", "It can be traumatic though. But it's most definitely not sexual abuse."]}
