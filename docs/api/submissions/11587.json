I\u2019ll get right into it. I (22F) have a twin, \u201cMark\u201d (22M) and an older sister \u201cRiley\u201d (25F). Mark and I\u2019s relationships with Riley have always been strained, as she was rather resentful of us (especially me) growing up. My mother says that this is because when Mark and I were born, people would always express more interest in us than Riley, since we were twin babies. She hasn\u2019t explained why Riley seemingly never got over this, but I digress. \n\nRecently, all three of us were visiting my parents over the holidays. While there, my mom commented on how proud she was of all of us. Mark and I thanked her, but Riley countered this by saying, \u201cI should be the proud one. I basically raised them.\u201d We were all taken aback by this, and asked Riley to explain what she meant. \n\nSome backstory: my mom worked part time when we were kids, and while she was working her parents (my grandparents) would babysit all three of us. As we grew older, my mom never once asked Riley to babysit Mark and I (this would\u2019ve been difficult anyways, given the not-huge age gap). She always hired a sitter if my grandparents weren\u2019t available, even when Riley told her that she was too old to be babysat. We all split chores evenly, and my parents or I cooked dinner every night. \n\nRiley followed up her claim by saying \u201cI always was in charge of driving them places. School, our sporting events, everywhere. That was completely unfair to me - people now call that parentification. So, I\u2019m the one that should be proud.\u201d\n\nI laughed and said \u201cParentification is when the oldest sibling is given the role of a parent. Yes, you drove us to school - the same school that you went to! You only drove us to sporting events when you were also participating in them! If you recall, you literally never drove us anywhere that you weren\u2019t already going yourself. You were never parentified - and the fact that you think you were shows how awful of a sister you really are.\u201d\n\nAITA? I didn\u2019t think I was, but now Riley is pissed at me. She told me I had no idea what it\u2019s like to have to drive to school with your younger siblings, and to be honest, she\u2019s right. My mom didn\u2019t comment, but she did say that I shouldn\u2019t have engaged with her comment, so I\u2019m feeling like maybe I am TA.\n\nEdit: Since some are speculating about other underlying issues/difficulties that Riley may have, I feel that in all fairness I should include that Riley has a semi-complicated relationship with our mom, for reasons unrelated to my brother and I (mostly concerning her weight/my mom\u2019s privy to diet culture) - it\u2019s possible that this comment was a way of her getting back at my mom.", "created_utc": 1678070112, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jlv88/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_wasnt_a_victim_of/", "score": 236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm a \"Riley\", but I'm in my 30s now. Same age gap, my younger siblings are twins, my mum worked part time (and was even a single mum so there were no other parents around). We were left home together occasionally, but only when we were ALL old enough to be left home alone. I was in charge. I got my license and a car and I *was* expected to drop my siblings off at their activities, which at the time felt massively unfair, but in hindsight was really a small task that I could normally schedule my social life around. Sometimes I had to cook, when I got a job I was expected to pay board. Sometimes I *did* have to do \"parent\" jobs, like making sure homework was done or talking to teachers, but I wasn't responsible for those things.\n\nNothing that I did was *raising* them, it was helping my mum. Like a chore extension, empty the dishwasher, feed the dog, take A to football, pick up B from guitar. I am *proud* of what I helped them accomplish, but I am not *responsible* for it. In my early 20s I resented having to help my mum, but now I recognise that I did have other options, I just didn't like the ramifications of not helping out. \n\nRiley wasn't parentified, she's feeling resentful of being expected to help her siblings growing up and is equating herself with being abused for a fairly normal family dynamic.

I drove my OLDER brother around all the damn time when we were teens because we was too lazy to learn to drive. That isn't parentification. Not even a little bit. It's a thing siblings do. She just wants to hold on to her bitterness and likely spends too much time online picking up buzzwords she can try and use to turn herself into a victim.

When she got her drivers license, her first car was a stretch limo so she could drive all eight siblings while her parents road separately in my grandpa\u2019s convertible. My grandmother was around, and they also had hired help, but my mom definitely had some degree of parentification. You know how we can tell?

You perfectly pointed out one of the key differences; Riley was already going to all of those places anyway, there was absolutely no inconvenience to her.\n\nIF you need to re-engage, the simplest explanation of parentification is: making a minor child responsible and accountable for their younger siblings. So having your older child \"watch\" their younger siblings after school; not parentification, they're already going to be home, they're just able to dial 911 a bit better. Having an older child reheat a dinner that was previously made; not parentification, again, they're already going to be feeding themselves, they just need to heat up more food....Forcing your child to quit an after school activity to watch their younger siblings, holding your child accountable for their younger siblings actions, making your child fund their siblings activities etc....these are parentification.", "NTA.

Now I completely understand the contempt some of them must feel who have experienced parentification, as in they raise children they didn't have. But people like Riley are just incredibly entitled. I think it comes from a place of being the only child and getting all the attention and everything is about them to it no longer being that way. Now they have siblings who they believe are favored but in reality they simply require extra care because they're babies.\n\nMy mom is one of these people. She has two younger siblings, 5 and 7 years younger than her. She always complains about how her parents were so strict with her and her siblings had it so easy. But honestly my mom was just a really rebellious kid while my aunt and uncle have always been mild mannered, so yeah it makes sense that my mom was disciplined more. And from the stories I heard, I think my mom just exhausted them to their wits end.\n\nMy husband on the other hand LOVES being an older brother, and because of that, him and his lil bro have a great relationship. His lil bro looks up to him so much and always asks him for advice and what not. Sure my husband acknowledges that his dad is easier on his brother than he was with him, but also acknowledges the large age difference and that his dad is just older and has less energy now. But instead of being resentful and jealous, my husband has gone out of his way to toughen his brother up in tough love kind of way that his brother appreciates. It's the same situation as my mom but, he's choosing to take a different approach by embracing the older sibling role instead of being made a victim by it.", "Social worker here! You're right that parentification is when a child is given responsibilities similar to a parent. Other examples include expecting a child to wake up their siblings and getting them ready for school (bathed, dressed, and fed), watching them on a regular basis for extended periods of time, and working to provide for the family. \nIt sounds like she's hurt by something though. Maybe it's just the driving, maybe it's jealousy that you guys were given more attention when you guys were little; I don't know, I'm not there. But calling your sister \"awful\" is definitely not going to make her like you more. \nI'm going to give a soft ESH because it sounds like everyone made a not a great move in the conversation. Could've been worse, could've been better.", "Info: did she ever have to do chores for you two? Like wash your clothes or was responsible for helping you clean your rooms?

You walk the kilometre and a half home from school and wash whatever dishes that were made while you were at school.

All that and I still honestly didn't have it as bad as others.\n\nRiley didn't even babysit her siblings?? She just drove to them to school and events she was already going to, that's just convenience. All Riley has is some made up problems she has with her brothers that she needs to go see a therapist about.", "yes bc famously parents' only role is to drive people places. she is not a victim of anything at all and is being entitled. My own sister genuinely had to cook fo the family, clean the whole house, and babysit 2 younger sisters in place of my dad, and had to be there when he wasnt. For YEARS. THAT is parentification. \"riley\" is entirely wrong", "What do you see as an example of parentification in the OP\u2019s post, specifically?", "Yes, parents should cater to their children 24/7 and never give them chores or any responsibilities at all. That\u2019s how to raise competent adults and productive members of society. \n\nOh wait, it\u2019s not.", "How so? She was never forced to babysit. She wasn't forced to do their chores for them. I'm betting the car she used when she drove HERSELF and her siblings to school in was both bought and insured by the parents.  Parentification would have been not being allowed to participate in sports, attend afterschool events, or hang out with friends because she had to take care of her younger siblings,  It would be being left in charge of getting them up, feeding them breakfast, making sure they got dressed before school, etc. every morning or almost every morning and/or being responsible for them after school- feeding them a snack, helping them with homework, making them dinner, etc every day or almost every day.  Using your parent's car to drive them to school and events that you are already attending is not parentification.  Resenting them because you are jealous is a YOU problem, not parentification.  And just so you know, I am the older sibling of twins and I was never jealous of them.  Quite the contrary, I was happy I wasn't a twin because they were always lumped together, matching outfits, and expected to like the same things because they were twins while I was free to be me.+", "What?", "Her truth is being an entitled brat.", "No. Her truth cannot conflict with reality and becomes a problem when it is a negative statement of others. \n\nHer truth can be that she hated driving them around and she wishes she refused or something else. But it cannot be that she was parentified when it is objectively false.", "Because it\u2019s pretty fucking random to say you were parentified for no reason at all.", "The question is more geared toward her being responsible for your wellbeing. I got in trouble a lot for what my brother did because it was my responsibility to look after him and make sure he did what he was supposed to.", "I don't know, I see a lot of people on AITA misusing terms like parentification all the time.  All it would take would be for the sister to learn the word and mistakenly think it applied to her."]}
