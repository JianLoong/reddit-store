They screwed up, its on them.", "NTA, it may seem a little harsh but your parents can't just expect to sponge off you. You have worked hard to get to where you are, you should enjoy it because you certainly can't take it with you. Your Mum chose to quite 9 months before she could get her pension, seriously? She couldn't stick it out for 9 months? That's on her, plenty of people hate their jobs but they continue on because it pays the bills and puts food on the table, it's called being an adult.\n\nI will say this though, from a financially responsible point of view. Make sure you have a few savings accounts, one for saving up for holidays, big ticket items etc, the other a \"rainy day\" account for when unexpected things crop up like a car needing to be fixed, appliance or furniture needing to be replaced all of a sudden because those unexpected expenses sting quite a bit if you're not prepared.", "The remaining family could pull their collective thumbs out and support your parents if its such a big deal to them. You are most certainly nta.", "NTA, if you wanted to you could decide to give them a certain amount of money that works for you, but you don't need to support them just because she didn't feel like working for the next nine months.", "NTA. Just tell anyone that calls you selfish that they are more than welcome to send your parents money. You work very hard for your money. They should do the same. \n\nCongratulations on breaking the cycle. I\u2019m so happy for you.", "NTA  \nIf your parents are struggling, it's a lifestyle they CHOSE for themselves. Move forward with no guilt.", "NTA. Your mother's decision has nothing to do with you. And you better bet they will expect to have their lives funded even after she gets her pension.", "NTA. Your parents have made a lot of poor financial choices that are absolutely not your problem. I would suggest you give them nothing and I don\u2019t understand those here who say NTA, you owe them nothing BUT perhaps you should give them something. Why? Not every situation needs a compromise. Your parents need to accept the consequences of their actions. \nIf anything your parents should be happy for you being able to provide for yourself what they couldn\u2019t. Decent parents want better for their children, not to live off them.", "NTA. They are more than welcome to chip in.", "Oh, hell no! Your mom CHOSE to stop working so she ought to experience the effects of that choice. They both CHOSE to not work consistently so they ought to experience the effects of that choice. Tell the family to put their money where their mouths are and bid them good day! NTA", "NTA. They don't have to be in the situation they're in, they've chosen it the same way they kept choosing to leave jobs.\n\nBut take some advise from someone who has lived through a situation similar to yours, save now. Sure, do fun stuff, go on holiday and buy nice things, but save and keep saving. Don't blow everything on expensive stuff, create a nest egg for the just in case. Don't perpetuate the cycle of no liquidity, just with more money.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom didn't have to quit her job, so all of that is on them. \n\nEnjoy your life.", "NTA. Your parents are struggling because your mom CHOSE to quit her job. If she was out of work because of a car accident or something else she had no control over you might help, but you ate NOT obligated to fund her just because she doesn\u2019t want to work!", "NTA, but YWBTA if you let them steal your fun from you. \n\nIt would be different if they couldn\u2019t work for some reason, but even then it would not be your responsibility to look after them. \n\nBut this is not what you\u2019re dealing with - they have repeatedly chosen to take time off work with no income - and you suffered because of that choice you could not control. \n\nThere is absolutely no way that your mum choosing not to work should become your problem. She is an adult. She gets to make her choice & then live with the consequence of her choice. Adults don\u2019t get to make a choice and then have a different person take responsibility for the consequences of that choice. Only kids get that option. \n\nPlease keep exploring life, and finding out what awesome things are available to you now that you\u2019ve got your degree & job & work ethic. \n\nYou deserve the good things that you have earned. \n\nWell done you.", "Your parents are choosing to struggle.

At first I was like oh yes, OP is the AH but reading the bit about the mom quitting her job because she didn't like it is what changed my mind. Does anyone like working? Probably not, but we do it because bills need to be paid."]}
