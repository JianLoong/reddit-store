My roommates and I don\u2019t talk to her anymore because we found out she was spreading really nasty rumors to try to turn us all against each other while staying friends with her. Once we found out it she was pretty much ostracized. She and I share one side of the apartment though, so we made some basic ground rules, the biggest and most recent one being you MUST ask to borrow anything. \n\nShe breaks every rule in the book. She drained an entire bottle of my sriracha. She poured my local wildflower honey down the sink. Yesterday, I caught her using my spices. This one really hit hard for me because funds are very tight and one of my only joys is baking.\n\nI texted her and asked her \u201chey please don\u2019t use my spices anymore. I know you have your own and they\u2019re expensive so I can\u2019t afford to share\u201d. She responded saying \u201cthen don\u2019t use my Tupperware\u201d. I was confused because I didn\u2019t think I had.\n\nSo I go to check to see if I actually did use it, and I can\u2019t find my chicken. I look around and see she dumped it in the sink, still inside the Tupperware but submerged under her dirty dishes. I take the Tupperware to her room and asked why she did this, and she said it was because the Tupperware was hers and I was using her property without her permission. I rebutted that she stole my spices, and she\u2019s wasting my money and my food. Spices can\u2019t be washed and reused after cooking with them. I told her that our Tupperware was almost identical and how could she waste a pound of chicken like that. She literally got up and used her door to push me out of the room and lock it.\n\nI lost it. I screamed to my other roommate what was happening and had a breakdown crying saying I don\u2019t have this kind of money to waste and I can\u2019t afford her throwing away 2-3 meals of chicken and that i can\u2019t stand living here anymore. We went to the store together and bought Tupperware and a box with a padlock and labeled almost everything that I owned in the kitchen. I padlocked my spices. I removed every utensil she was storing in my organizers and put them in an empty drawer then I labeled every cupboard and cabinet in the kitchen according to whose stuff was where. \n\nI did all of this and I feel like I\u2019ll regret it tomorrow. I\u2019ve never been this petty, but she\u2019s making me feel like the way she\u2019s treating me is my fault. I almost want to make it worse. Our Tupperware really do look very similar and I tried to not make the same mistake since I put my honey in her measuring cup for a few hours and she tossed it, and that\u2019s why we made the \u201cno touching people\u2019s dishes/containers without asking\u201d rule. Every time she breaks a rule I try to explain to her why it\u2019s irritating. But she literally won\u2019t listen.

Yes, you should've been more careful with the Tupperware but that can't be compared to food.

Locked up everything that is yours so she absolutely can't use it.  And that's fair.  You can't use her stuff, she can't use yours.  Your next battle might be what happens if she leaves her dirty stuff in the kitchen and doesn't clean up - perhaps look at a bucket/laundry basket that you put it all in and leave it outside the backdoor (so it doesn't smell the kitchen up or get in your way) - yes you will still need to clean the benches, but at least you aren't cleaning her stuff.\n\nWill she consider moving out?  You can always replace her if she does.  If she doesn't then I wouldn't be going out of my way to make things pleasant for her.", "NTA. She sounds *horrible*.

While some of the post is worded in a way that can be confusing, it sounds like you used her Tupperware by accident, and the only reason the \"no using other people's stuff without asking,\" rule was made was to circumvent her throwing your food out when you used her stuff. While you should've initially asked to use her stuff, she should've just told you to not use her stuff like an adult. Times are tough, food is expensive right now, and people are having a hard time affording it. I would've initially said e s h due to the miscommunication all around, but the wasting of someone's food was really what changed my judgement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Both of your behavior sounds bad, but you are literally being a huge hypocrite, you barged into her room and I\u2019m assuming wouldn\u2019t leave when asked because she had to literally push you out, and then you got mad that she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you and say that you want to make it \u201cworse\u201d ? You actually sound like a nightmare.", "Yta\n\nI was on your side until the last paragraph. So you used her stuff and freak out when she does the same? Rules for thee but not for me.", "ESH. You're both acting like children.\n\nI do think there's a slight difference between using a plastic container and using someone's food items, because one can be washed & dried and the other needs to be replaced, and wasting food is awful, but you can't have it both ways. \n\nIf the relationship has broken down one someone needs to move out, preferably her if everyone else isn't talking to her as well.", "ESH \n\nIf you want her to respect your property, then you need to show the same respect to hers. It\u2019s that simple. How something is used, or whether or not it can be used again isn\u2019t the point. If you want her to ask your permission, then you need to do the same. \n\nShe should not have taken the chicken out of the fridge, and she should not be wasting your food. She should be asking, or operating under the expectation that the answer is no if you are unavailable to otherwise answer the question for permission. \n\nNot everyone is cut out to live together. Now you know before signing your next lease. \n\nIt sounds like everyone has decided to ice her out by treating her like crap.

She sounds incredibly hostile, although tbh you should have watched better to avoid accidentally using her things (I get that it happens, but she seems to be weaponizing everything against you). Do NOT feel bad you locked up your** stuff. \nI had a horrible roommate who turned our apartment into a hostile living situation, and I essentially did the same thing (it was a three bedroom and since my then boyfriend/now husband shared a room, the room I paid for was storage). We were so over his behavior (which included peeing in a spray bottle and spraying our rooms with it, with our pet in the same room) that we took ALL of our stuff from shared areas and placed it in the locked room. All of the kitchen utensils were mine, so when he had a new boyfriend over and wanted to cook bacon he was shit out of luck (and in my pettiness it was honestly so fulfilling, lol). Shouldn't have been a fucking creep and asshole.", "ESH. Her crossing of boundaries is no worse than your crossing of boundaries.", "ESH You are both children.", "ESH y\u2019all need to grow up. It\u2019s petty BS all around and if you don\u2019t resolve it you are going to be in an uncomfortable living situation for however long it takes before someone blows up and moves out. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for labeling your things. Apparently that\u2019s what you have to do in your living situation.", "Kick her out. ESH", "ESH \n\n\nIf you\u2019re going to make a deal of every time she breaks a rule, you should expect the same in reverse. \n\nYou are both behaving like children.", "ESH you sound just as much of a nightmare to live with as her.", "Shitty roommate situation and all, I'm just wondering how expensive can spices be and how often do you finish them.", "ESH", "Im not voting one way or another on which is more severe, cause obvi tupperware washable\n\nI think if I voted either, I would look at like...while yes, what she did was more shitty...OP is slightly shitty too for making the rule but not following it. Which is shitty itself too.\n\nI think that's why most are saying  e.s.h, but I totally agree roommate is the most AH here, OP only slightly is", "yeah if she cared so much about the tupperware and other kitchen gear being used she could have LABELLED THEM. All you have to do is write your name in sharpie on the bottom, or on the lid. tadaaa problem solved.", ">If you're going to call her out on it every time she uses something of yours then you need to be more careful than it sounds like you're being about not using her things. \n\nBut it sounds like the roommate is using up OPs food vs just using a container or cooking utensil. Containers and measuring cups can be washed. Using an entire thing of Sriracha, spices, honey and throwing out chicken is actually costly and wasteful.", "Yeah I understand. I feel like I\u2019ve been really consistent with asking permission to use everything. We both agreed and to find out she\u2019s been stealing my food the whole time when I\u2019ve been asking to use a pan or a pair of chopsticks that I clean immediately after use feels like a slap in the face because I\u2019ve been trying to be friendly, bake her things, make her dinner, etc. With her though the broken rules go beyond just stealing. It\u2019s smoking inside, locking people out, putting her bedroom trash into the kitchen trash can, playing loud music at 2AM, etc. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m being hypocritical but I feel like the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime. I know I used it, but it was an accident truly and it was one time in a month.

Someone does go hungry when their food it deliberately destroyed.", "She is a slight A H, I do agree with that. She can't have it both ways.", "They can be reused but they don't last forever, they still get damaged by use and wear out. Also, not all Tupperware is microwave or freezer safe so she could be using them incorrectly and destroying them. \n\nPlus, they're there for the roommate to use. If she can't use them because they're occupied, then what's the point of having it? OP using it does it take the containers away from her.

What is your rental agreement? I once lived in a house with three other people, one of whom was like this, and with the support of our landlord, myself and the other two were able to evict the bad roommate.

That\u2019s no way to live. IMO it would be better to get her kicked out rather than just tolerate this indefinitely.", "Okay, fair, that was rude of her unless you were screaming at her or something. You were still being hypocritical, though. You can\u2019t tell people not to use your stuff while you\u2019re currently also using their stuff without permission. She could\u2019ve told you to move your food to your own tupperware, but honestly you should\u2019ve checked to make sure, and then washed her dishes that you used before trying to get on her about using your stuff."]}
