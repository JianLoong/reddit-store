And the fact she had the audacity to kick him out of the place he\u2019s living is ridiculous. Good for you for supporting your son and don\u2019t give any ground on the matter", "NTA. You are correct, your wife is making something out of nothing. Maybe if you were charging your son rent then it might be worth a conversation but is sounds like this woman isn't even there full time which makes things complicated. \n\nAlso someone people are private about their love life. Nothing wrong with that. Based on what my brother shared with us about his he's only ever dated one woman besides his now wife( I know that is not the case).", "NTA. But is your son your wife's step son? I am trying to figure out why she is over-reacting to such a degree and wanting to charge just the girlfriend rent.", "NTA, but your wife is. Your son is allowed by you to live in the condo she has no right to enter in it nor kick him out. She is very entitled.\n\nWhat about her did she pay the rent of the condo for the shopping trip? Does she pay the rent in your house?", "Ooof. She had an ugly reaction, that\u2019s for sure! \n\nAs for the question at hand, who knows? Is it yours yours, or ours \u201cyours\u201d, is a great first question\u2026there\u2019s details here that could change the answer\u2026.\n\nBut yes, I do think she is making an awfully big deal out of nothing.\n\nNTA", " NTA.  But your wife is.  Stand your ground, your son is an adult.", "NTA - Your wife sucks", "NTA.  Your wife is making a big deal over nothing.  I'm curious to know what her hangup is.", "INFO: Does you wife have any claim of ownership of the condo, either because her name is on the deed or through marriage property laws?\n\nRegardless, kudos for making things right with your son, and trying to insulate him from an issue between you and your wife.", "~~INFO: are you the sole owner of the studio or is it a marital property?~~\n\nNever mind, saw that it was your inheritance. NTA, then, and your wife is way out of line. If you are letting your son be the primary resident, he can let in whoever he wants, his girlfriend, boyfriend, and host orgies, if that's what his heart desires, as long as you and him are in agreement about the rent, even if it's zero, she should butt out.", "NTA at all", "NTA\n\nKudos for having his back and refunding your son the cost of his hotel, you\u2019re a great dad!", "NTA", "Your wife is definitely making a big deal out of it. Showing up to a 24-year olds apartment unannounced is an interesting choice. NTA.", "You are not the asshole your wife is making a big deal out of nothing and treating your son very poorly. He is a grown man and she treats him like a child who snuck a girl into his room at night.", "Info: So how k!nky was the s3x for your wife to be acting like this?", "Its understandable why your wife would be upset but it\u2019s your son a full grown adult who can live his life how he pleases. It definitely would\u2019ve been a good idea for him to ask/mention it, but theres no point punishing them for not doing it at this point. However is this an owned or rented condo? Is it in both your names. If it is in only yours NTA, but if it\u2019s in both ESH", "INFO:  \nWhile I do not consider it problematic to offer a no-rent stay at all and even less having a partner over at this age: I think since you are married the condo belongs to you both?   \nAt least in all modern western countries this would be the case. And this would change whether a decision can be made alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it's absolutely reasonable to ask for some sort of compensation considering all the circumstances. I'm aware this issue is asking about rent, but I think OP is a bit of an asshole for not even attempting to reach an agreement with their wife. OP should require this friend to pay part of utilities.
