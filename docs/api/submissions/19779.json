Anything more than that, and the visitor needs to be on the lease. Not saying it's right or wrong, all I'm saying is that this how it should be looked at because if something did happen and it went to court, somebody is likely to end up in a bad spot as a result of losing the case.\n\nA very easy way to avoid a mess like that is for the son to be like \"hey dad, just wanted to let you know that my girlfriend (or friend, doesn't matter) stays here every weekend (or stays here X nights per month) because of her work situation\" and then they can put it on paper, update/revise the lease, or whatever just to make sure everybody's best interest is covered (whether that means she's put on the lease, or a guest clause is given a more generous allotment of overnight stays, whichever works best for them...assuming that a formal written lease agreement exists).\n\nIt's important because tenant (and landlord) rights exist in every state, even if the lease agreement was verbal/not written, and it can potentially be enforced if the gal is a tenant according to the law, even if dad didn't know about her.", "Absolute feral behaviour. Like have they never learned any manners?", "NTA \nMy Ex\u2019s Mum is like this one here, and it always gave me the creeps because there was some serious emotional incest going on. I have a son, I can\u2019t imagine reacting the way this woman did to him having a partner. I would be secretly hoping the person became a spouse and doing my best to absolutely make myself scarce. It is really skeevy for a mother to automatically despise a new girlfriend.", "It says \"his mom\" in the post. So I'm not sure why you think stepmom.", "OP refers to my son and my wife.... might not be his mother, could be his stepmother?", "Even if it\u2019s his inheritance, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that his wife would have no claim to it if they divorced. Not all countries have the same laws. It sounds like OP should make sure his will reflects his wishes in regards to the apartment.", "Yeah, not sure now that you mention it. \n\nThere's that line, but then there's this:\n\n> My wife freaks out and yells at my son", "fixed, I think."]}
