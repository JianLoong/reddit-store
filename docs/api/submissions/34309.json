My kids and I would stay at the home with her typically one weekend per month when I was visiting my two kids who lived nearby. We always did projects around the house to help fix it up at my cost. \n\nWe all live together now in an apartment in a different state that we both picked out together and moved into at the same time (she came from out of state; I was local). I covered 100% of expenses while she settled into a new job over 3 months.  This included rent, parking, storage, all utilities, rental insurance... literally all expenses for the home.\n\nNow that she's settled into her new job, I've asked her to pay her fair share of expenses. By fair, I suggested we total our combined incomes, determine the percentage we each contribute, then pay that percentage of the joint bills (e.g. my income makes up 59% of our joint income, so I'd pay 59% of the joint bills).  I thought this to be more fair than 50/50, even though she's using more of the home's value (her and her daughter vs just me).\n\nShe asked if we would include her mortgage in the joint bills as we had loosely talked about before.  I told her I'd be open to it, but that she needed to be aware that co-mingling our funds to pay the mortgage would make her house a joint asset.  I also said that if I didn't have a stake in the property, I wasn't interested in paying any bills for it. \n\nShe balked hard at this saying she'd have to cut back on paying down her prior debt so she could cover both the mortgage and her 41% of our bills. She also insinuated that I should pay even more than the 59% proposed.  I was surprised and a little appalled, particularly since she knows I'm carrying substantial debt as well.\n\nAm I the asshole?  Am I missing some perspective?", "created_utc": 1704338292, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18y2t7j/aita_for_expecting_my_fiance_to_pay_her_share_of/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So no NTA. Because let's face it, is she going to share rent payments if she is able (and willing) to rent the house if she isn't living in the home? That's separate income/expense unrelated to your current living arrangement and expenses.", "NTA\n\nI get her wanting to keep it a separate asset. But that should mean you never drop a dime on that home. \n\nShe however is absolutely obligated to pay her share for the home you share. If it's a strain on her, that's her problem. Iron this out before daring to plan a wedding.", "Definitely NTA. If it's her house and not yours, it needs to be paid with her personal funds. It's not a shared expense unless she's gonna put your name on the house.", "NTA, she\u2019s being asked to equitably contribute, not equally contribute. Her premarital asset is her responsibility, if she needs you to help out then you\u2019d need a stake in it.", "NTA\n\nIts a separate asset. I wouldn't consider it my problem.", "NTA. I'm with you. If she wants \"her\" mortgage to be a joint expense, then any new equity needs to be community property. Equity doesn't need to be divided 50/50 since she started paying into it while single. But it shouldn't be 0/100, either.\n\nAsking you to split the cost with her, or take on more than 59% of shared bills so that she can keep paying down \"her\" mortgage, is immensely unfair.", "**NTA**   The truth is, she cannot afford to maintain a separate asset.   That's her problem not yours.  She doesn't get to use you to put a roof over her and her child's head while she pursues being a real estate mogul.   She want's it all and doesn't have the wherewithal for that.\n\nShe bought a house while she was in a new relationship, then moved to a new place with an unrealistic set of expectations.   You've been carrying her for the past 3 months and she needs to figure out how to pay her way.    If you can find a way to afford it, you need to get some premarital counseling asap.\n\nETA:  \n>We always did projects around the house to help fix it up at my cost. \n\nAny chance you have receipts?   Any improvements and repairs on her property are 100% her responsibility.", "INFO - why didn\u2019t you discuss finances in detail before you moved in together?\n\nNow, you might be stuck paying 100% of the bills or she might be stuck with rent expenses she didn\u2019t expect.", "NTA \u2014 This would be my hill to die on!", "NTA. Join assets and costs are a joint responsibility. Individual assets are not only not a joint responsibility, but should be entirely excluded from household finances.\n\nShe shouldn't expect you to subsidise her cost of living so that she can have something that brings you no benefit. If she can't afford her own mortgage after *her own* living expenses, then she can't afford to own the house.\n\nEither you get a share or she can figure it out on her own.", "NTA. She needs to move back to her own home and pay that off first or sell it before moving in to a new place she can't afford.", "Definitely NTA. She sounds like one though.", "NTA- You're being used and financially abused!", "NTA but you're both idiots for not discussing finances before moving in together.  Causes a lot of couples fights,  just read them on reddit!  And yeah, not your house, not part of joint bills.", "NTA.   \n I am so glad you are dealing with this BEFORE you get married. This is the sort of financial crud people have to resolve BEFORE they legally entangle.   \n\n\nCan you both go to a financial counsellor or accountant and get a plan that\u2019s covering both your debts (can you find a way to reduce both your debts substantially), and resolve this like adults?", "When are you getting married? You\u2019ll be combining assets soon anyways (And debt). Once you\u2019re married are you still going to want her to pay the full other mortgage?", "I\u2019m seeing this a little different, she\u2019s moved to be with you and had to give up her previous job and life to do this.  I can see her wanting to keep hold of the house for a while to confirm the relationship is going to work out.  \n\nCan you compromise and revisit in say a year?  Maybe you occasionally take on some additional discretionary expenses.  You don\u2019t want to be in a position where she comes resentful because her lifestyle isn\u2019t sustainable and that if debt isn\u2019t paid down it will affect your ability to buy in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially as they have both have had children from previous relationships etc and know how complicated and messy relationships can get.", "I don't believe that's correct (I'm not a lawyer, but did go through a divorce a few years ago).  Assets and debt accrued prior to marriage are considered \"separate\", while any assets or debt accrued during the marriage becomes \"community\" (joint).  If we were to divorce and I helped pay the mortgage, I'd be entitled to half of any equity gained during the marriage.  That's unless we show in writing intent for me to \"gift\" payment without intent for the asset to become community or even if we unintentionally create clear traceability of funds from separate sources. \n\nIn other words, by not mixing funds, her paying the mortgage directly from her separate bank account, and me paying more of the joint bills, it would appear as if we intended to keep the property separate even though I carried the bulk of the burden for martial expenses.", "Hey I found OP's fiance!", "My kids live in Florida with their mom.
