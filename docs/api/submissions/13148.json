For a rich person she's pretty normal, she has a full time job, doesn't get much financial support from her parents, shares a house with 3 others, etc. - the only way you can really tell she's rich is that she has really nice jewelry, some nice clothes, a new car and fancy family holidays. \n\nAri prefers to shop at cheap, fast fashion places and doesn't really know much about designers. Even though I'm not rich, I am an avid hunter of second-hand designer bargains. If we each had $50 Ari would rather buy a $50 dress from H&M whereas I'd be rather buy a $200 secondhand Zimmermann dress, wear it five times, and re-sell it for $150. \n\nThe other day I went to Ari's place for dinner and she was halfway through cleaning out her closet. She'd received a bunch of designer clothes, purses and shoes for Christmas and her birthday, which she wasn't going to wear. She was also throwing out some old work clothes and wedding outfits. I looked through the pile and there were some really nice brands in there worth hundreds of dollars. I asked if she planned to sell them and she said she would just donate them, because she'd tried to sell stuff online before without success. I thought it was likely this was because nobody wanted to buy her H&M stuff secondhand, and gently suggested that her high end things would do better online. She said she couldn't be bothered doing the listings and \"just want to get rid of it\" and I suggested I could help list them, and we could split the profit 50/50. She eagerly agreed. \n\nI took the items home, took photos of everything, listed them in specialist brand name forums and groups, and have sold a lot of things, which I organised to post or delivered. So far I've made $1400. When I told Ari I'd be sending her $700 she was surprised but overjoyed and thanked me profusely, saying that she had no idea how much those items were worth. \n\nI told my mum about this thinking she would be impressed but surprisingly she told me I took advantage of Ari. She said I should have made it more clear to her how much her items were worth, and that 50% 'commission' was an inappropriate amount to charge for items worth so much money. She said that after Ari commented that she didn't know how much the items had been worth I should have offered to give her more of the proceeds. I don't really see this perspective as she was fully ready to just donate the items and I've made her $700 that she wouldn't have had otherwise.

Ari was going to toss or donate, so she (and you) have $700 you otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had. Your mom is wrong, too. Consignment shops generally take 50% and you did the same.", "NTA. If you didn't show up, those clothes would've been bagged and donated. You both agreed 50/50 split. You did all the work and Ari got a lot more money than she expected. You both profited from the sale.\n\nI have no idea why some moms get so bent out of shape when their daughters do things they wouldn't do. I wonder what she would have said if you were a man? Sorry, I'm projecting. For the past 30 years, I would hear my mom's disapproval when I tell her how I stood up for myself (too blunt) or how I was assertive (too aggressive) instead of the passive routes she took in life. \n\nYou did a great job and have a real knack for business.", "NTA. She would have just donated the items, instead did no work, she has $700 and is HAPPY. It sounds like you both benefit from this. I have sold some items online and it does take time and effort that a lot of people do not want to commit.", "NTA\n\nNo way! Good for you, and good for Ari! She was literally going to give this shit away for free, and your hard work has turned her donations into some serious cold hard cash for you both!! If you had told her you'd take her stuff to the donation center and had secretly sold them online and pocketed the proceeds, I'd agree with your mom 100%. But you did a good thing, and you've been handsomely rewarded.", "NTA you did all the work and you both agreed to split it 50 50", "NTA You have an agreement and you are both happy with it.", "NTA. If you and your friend both think it's a good deal, alls good. She didn't plan to get anything so that $700 in her pocket. Maybe take he out to eat as a thank you (not uncommon in a client interaction anyway).\n\nYou were selling on consignment. 50% is high, but 40% isn't crazy. You're only talking about 10% or so. Well in the realm a dinner will make up if you were so inclined. Tell your mom to mind her own business. She doesn't need to start drama where there is none.", "NTA. You made a deal with her, and you did so when you told her the things were worth money. \n\nBut also Ari is not rich. Her parents are.", "Technically NTA.  But yes it would have been better if you had told your friend about it. Also selling things is quite some work. But i do think being honest was a healthier way to approach this.\n\n\nAnyway you both are happy now with the results and I really hope it doesn't make the friendship sour in the end.", "NTA. Ari put zero effort in, was going to donate the items anyway and would have had a similar proceeds split had she gone consignment. Your mom is wrong.", "I mean...by not being upfront about the value of the items, technically you did take advantage and 50% 'commission' is higher than normal. Does it matter? I don't know, Ari doesn't seem bothered but she also sounds pretty naive. Personally I wouldn't want to make my money like that but you do you. NAH I guess.", "NTA\n\n\nImo, offering 50% is a bargain to your friend and a lot of work for you. You earned it and to be fair, you probably should get 60%.  \n\nI've sold online. I no longer sell for others because people think their shit is gold and I have plenty of shit of my own to sell.\n\nYou've got a good, fair deal going. Keep $elling.", "NTA. She agreed. Even if she didn\u2019t know how much money to expect, she said she\u2019s okay with you having half of it. Also selling stuff can make you busy. Packaging, talking to people etc. Now 700$ is actually a lot and if you feel bad about taking so much money \u201cfrom her\u201d you can always talk to her about it, if she really is okay with that", "NTA. The only two people involved in the deal are happy, and your mom doesn\u2019t really get an opinion.", "NTA\n\nSince Ari had no expectations of a return you did nothing wrong & you helped your friend. \n\nIn terms of a business practice, this would be considered deceptive. Without full disclosure & her knowing how much her items were worth there would be no way for her to know if you actually split the proceeds. You could easily pocket 80% or not list all her items & keep them for yourself. Since she is the person with the original investment she should have accurate information about what her ROI could be.", "NTA.\n\nIt was a pre agreed fair deal.\nThat is how business works... upon deals!\nEnjoy!", "NAH i dont agree with your mom, but i can see her point. You should have explained it to ari at that these items are very expensive before listing them, or at least told her how much you're listing them for. Either way Ari got 700 instead of 0 from donating.", ">( ... ) and gently suggested that her high end things would do better online.\n\nHm. The way you phrased this makes me think that you knew or suspected that if Ari knew the real price her high end clothes could be sold for, she wouldn't have wanted to go 50/50.\n\nI don't think splitting profits 50/50 was unfair, since you basically did the all the work and selling online can be quite a hassle. I just think you should have been more upfront and honest about the resale value of those fancy items so Ari could have made a better informed decision. \n\nThe behaviour you describe seems cheeky and calculating, but still, NTA.", "How did Ari feel once she found out? If she didn't care NTA. I can see how someone could feel taken advantage of, but if she didn't it is between you two. I live paycheck to paycheck,so every penny counts, and it would have been really hard on me to lose out on potential money. For Ari, this really was just some bonus cash you got her. So I don't think it was the nicest way to go about it, but it is a circumstantial AH act, and sounds like you hit the right circumstances to avoid it. If Ari had questioned it and you stuck to \"It's a deal!\" My vote might change.", "I believe that you acted in good faith and without any intention to deceive, as evidenced by voluntarily giving her 50% of the profit. You did both you and your friend a favour. I imagine it took a fair bit of work to prepare the listings and sell the clothes, which is why your friend didn't want to do it. In that situation, 50% sounds reasonable to me. Different people may quibble over the percentage but that's subjective and not hugely important in my view.\n\nIf I were Ari I would be delighted that you took those clothes off my hands, and even more delighted at the income.\n\nNTA, but I understand your mother's perspective. If this happens again it would be better to tell Ari the expected value up front so she can make a more informed decision. In this case, it's most likely Ari doesn't care because money is not a concern for her, but if this happens for a friend in different circumstances it could become an issue. Lesson learnt for next time.", "NTA. Ari made a good profit on stuff she was going to throw away. OP did all the work and took the chances (returns, people not paying, etc). OP could just as easily have kept 80% and Ari would have been non the wiser. OP made a deal, and kept up her part.", "NTA. You proposed something to another adult. They agreed to it. End of story.", "NTA Ari was fine with splitting 50/50 when you first suggested it and she was happy to receive the $700 and didn\u2019t question how much you were keeping for yourself. If she had had a problem with it, it could of changed things but ultimately you did her a favour.", "NTA. You did tell her they were worth something. You didn't know how much at the time and neither did she. You did all the work of selling them. She got 100% more than she would have done with her original plan. Shops that buy second hand clothes would not have given her so much.", "NTA and could you please come clean out my closet. \n\nIn all seriousness, commission rates for lower end designer items on sites like Poshmark and RealReal are much worse  for anything under $200 resale value, consignment shops are worse still, and you\u2019re likely getting her much better prices and providing a much better service than these alternatives. Last I checked a $200 resale item on RealReal kept about 55%, and under $100 it\u2019s 80%. She\u2019s getting a great deal from you.\n\nThe service you\u2019re providing her requires a lot of knowledge (market for second hand design, research on pricing, best forums to get good price), effort, and time.\n\nUnless you\u2019re reselling her \u201cold\u201d crocodile Birken bag for $50K and keeping half, you\u2019re good.", "NTA\n\nAri didn\u2019t find value and didn\u2019t want to deal with it. You did. Your mom needs to butt out as she isn\u2019t involved in this.", "NTA. An A H move would have been to ask her to give you the items, sell them, and then keep all the profits. We Taylor wasn\u2019t worth her time to her to sell them so she was going to donate. You made this work for both of you and absolutely did not take advantage of her.", "NTA you might need to look at other areas of your life and see if your mom unvalues your labor and effort. My mom normalized me to be an unpaid servant.", "NTA. It\u2019s a lot of work selling online! Negotiations, answering questions, rearranging your schedule for pick ups, people not showing up etc! You deserve every cent you made!", "NTA-you\u2019re mom\u2019s just jealous. Relax. She was happy to donate. Your mom would have likely found something wrong with any percentage breakdown that you two had agreed on. I mean, come on-how is anyone to know what would really be an appropriate fit-60/40? 70/30? Who knows? Im kinda glad you went 50/50 on it because Ari didn\u2019t do any work either-so this is preserving your friendship-any other split would have given one of your the upper hand. Ari\u2019s grateful, and you didn\u2019t \u201chide\u201d the amount. Clearly, Ari knows that you both earned $700 off the deal, and honestly, she\u2019ll proudly come to you again next year when she has more gifts to pawn off. You HELPED her. You\u2019re a good friend who is honest and hardworking. You are both lucky to have each other.\n\nOh, and maybe stop trying to get your mom\u2019s approval? I somewhat suspect that is what the issue is here.", "Im going NTA.\n\nShe has a good amount of money she was never going to get as do you for the work you did in actually selling them.\n\nHowever...\n\nI do feel as though your mum has a bit of a point in that you could have made it clearer to your friend from the offset the kind of of figures involved to allow her to make a better informed choice with how to proceed.", "NAH except the mom. You and Ari have behaved impeccably. It doesn\u2019t sound like she even has a problem with it so not sure why your mom does.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
