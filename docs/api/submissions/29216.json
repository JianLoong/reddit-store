You borrow something, you return it in the same condition or you replace it exactly.", "NTA - was taught at like 5 the rule is \u201cyou break it you buy it\u201d, not \u201cyou break it and then do your best to get out of paying full price\u201d. \n\nIf you plan on demanding the full price of the shirt + the needed alterations, you would be in the right to do so. But judging by the way the person who damaged the shirt is reacting I wouldn\u2019t have high hopes of them actually paying what\u2019s owed.

As much as I hate it I'd likely just get as much out of the guy as possible and eat the rest because my time and energy is worth a lot more than $75. I'd then make sure that guy never gets anything from me whether it's time, things, favours.\n\nThe mom thing is a ludicrously stupid argument unless the mom is a tailor. I know a dozen people that could work on my car cheaper than a mechanic but I'd rather have someone who does it day in day out. Skilled labour isn't cheap, cheap labour isn't skilled.\n\nAlso their family friends don't charge full rate is par for the course for cheap people. A family friend probably would give you a deal but it's uncouth to ask and if they offer you decline, if they insist you concede then you make it up via a dinner or a bottle of wine", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This dude doesn't deserve your time and he's hell bent on wasting it. He wants to paint you as someone whos greedy and you'd walk away spotless. It would also be funny to watch the other people in the group blow up when he destroys something he borrows from them after giving you shit.", "NTA.\n\nBut, where are you that a handmade shirt only costs $75?  Haiti?  My wife makes my shirts and would never sell herself that cheap.", "NTA. He owes you the cost of the shirt and the tailoring; it's called replacement value and is based on the item you loaned him, not his idea of what a shirt should cost. Put your foot down and find better friends. You should end your association with anyone who thinks it's okay to ruin your shirt and not replace it with the same brand, tailored to fit you.\n\nI'm sure his mom can sew, which is different than fitting and tailoring an existing item. She also doesn't have the same experience.", "Out of curiosity, did this dude in advance how much the shirt was? I know nothing about nice brands because they aren\u2019t my thing, and I\u2019ve had friends lend me things. I ask how much they are usually (not always because it might not cross my mind) and if they say a certain amount I sometimes refuse to borrow the thing. Sometimes they insist and I admit I won\u2019t be able to pay it back if I break/lose it. Sometimes my friends still insist and other times they re-think. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a jerk for wanting to support your friend or for wanting your item replaced, but if you have something of a lot of value over what might be expected (clothing, something of sentimental value, etc) it\u2019s nice to warn folks and then you\u2019re certainly in the clear from being a jerk if they break it and you want to be paid back for it.", "NTA\n\"Never a borrower nor lender be\".. Because people are assholes and if they ruin your stuff they will refuse to pay for it. He should be paying the full price of the shirt ans alterationsbas you sew fit. Maybe next time he will be more careful with his coffee.\n\nEdit: I can sew but I absolutely positively cannot tailor, that's a super skill that not every sewist has.", "$75 was just for the tailoring.", "The tailoring is $75.", "$75 to repair an expensive shirt that some Cro-Magnon tore is not unreasonable. Sewing is an easy skill to learn but time-consuming to master at a professional level."]}
