This beautiful boy is the light of my life but it was a major life change for us. Especially me as I was the one who gave up my job and my social life to be basically locked up isolated during covid with a baby. It was supposed to be temporary while they went to rehab. They never went to rehab nor complied with any of the safety plan set up by  CPS. From 2 months on they have not seen the baby nor supported him in any way. Johns family has not been involved either as they also refused to abide by the safetyplan or any of the CPS recommendations.\nNow 2 years later my husband and I have full legal custody and CPS has closed the file. We have put forth a petition to change the baby's name. At birth john and sue named the boy Steven to \"honor\" John's brother who died of an overdose (while partying with John and Sue who was PREGNANT and getting high) \nMy husband and I have never ever referred to the baby by that name. We always called him Davey (his middle name) after Sue and my husband's grandfather.\nSo instead of being Steven David Jones we are changing it to David Owen Smith. Owen is after my father who absolutely adores him and accepted him as grandson from day one.\nSo here's where I might have ventured to asshole. My husband thinks I went too far but I feel they pushed me to the end.\nJohn's family found out and blew up my social media and messaging.(not husbands just mine) Telling me that I have no right to change the name or honour my father because I'm nothing more than a babysitter and I'm not the real mother. I was called a babythief amongst more vile accusations. So I snapped and  responded back that MY son's names will honour good men that he could proudly emulate not like their junkie relative who was a shitstain on the world defrauding the govt for benefits and stealing from anyone he could and contributed nothing to life or society and his only accomplishment is that he odeed before he went to prison. Harsh.yes. but I still don't feel like I'm the asshole.\n\n*edit for clarity*\n\nI did not change the name on my own. My husband was very involved in the decision as were our 2  daughters who helped name their baby brother. The name reflects our cohesion as a family We are ALL Smith's. And my girls came up with the idea of using Pippys name because it shows he wasn't just adopted by my husband and I but by an entire family", "created_utc": 1667333377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjjstb/aita_for_changing_my_adoptive_sons_name_and/", "score": 11229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Including - especially - on social media (easier to say, I know).\n\nYou\u2019re doing great. Take care.", "NTA. His bio parents only care because it takes away the last bit of control they assumed they had. If you\u2019re doing everything for him and he\u2019s legally in your custody, you have the right to change his name. \n\nIf they don\u2019t like it, they can get better and fight in the court.", "NTA.  He's *your* child and you didn't change the name he actually goes by so you didn't cause him any confusion since at his age he's probably not even aware of his middle or last names yet anyway.  As for what you said, the fact is that people of the kind who were harassing you only understand extremely strong responses and so you gave them one.", "NTA. You are RAISING a son that was DISCARDED by the \u201cfamily\u201d that now accuses you of stealing him. You owe them NOTHING.

I\u2019m gonna go with no.\n\nThey needed a harsh dose of the truth. Block them on everything and keep David away from them.", "NTA. I love how no one has cared about this child until you dared change his name, where have they been all this time? Too late now!", "NTA. I\u2019m not adopted, so I can\u2019t speak to that life experience; however, I WAS raised around a lot of addicts and children of addicts and I can speak to how absolutely devastating it can be not only to be raised by one, but how doubly devastating it is for those kids to be surrounded by enablers of their parents. These people do not have the best interest of that child in mind, only their ego and the egos of their parents. By giving him a stable home without the influence of ANY of these people, and a name that doesn\u2019t carry any heartbreak or bad memories, you are giving him a shot at a normal life with as little generational trauma as possible.", "Mmm. Its tough but Im gonna say NTA.\n\n\nLike, your words were harsh, but you didnt lie, and you didnt say them out of the blue - they said disgusting things to you first. I think that makes you a justified asshole, which means you are N T A.\n\n\nThe baby hasnt ever gone by the name on paper, so changing his name legally makes total sense. Your kid is too young to choose their own name, so its not like you could ask the baby what it wants its name to be. And I sincerely doubt theyll be confused by it since youve never called him his legal name. As far as he can tell, his name will never change.\n\n\n\nAs an aside, sorry they said such things to you.

You\u2019re both the only parents he has ever known or will ever know. Why should he have the name of someone who threw their life away instead of names of good guys from both parents\u2019 sides? Ignore the people bitching about it. He\u2019s your baby.", "NTA\nYes you were harsh, but in situations like this I think it\u2019s called for. My parents raised my druggy aunt\u2019s children for a good while, and when you\u2019re dealing with someone like that, who is putting them and their children in danger you need to be harsh to them and anyone supporting their current lifestyle. It\u2019ll protect you and your family in the long run. My parents didn\u2019t get to keep my cousins because 1990s CPS in our state was a joke.

Go pound sand.. I wish I had someone like you and your husband growing up.", "NTA - fuck around and find out is my favorite thing to say. They fucked around and didn\u2019t listen to CPS and thought they could just do what they wanted while you did all the hard work and they could just step in one day and be mommy and daddy again.

People like that like to make drama but not actually help or be responsible.", "NTA - imagine instead of thanking you and your husband for shouldering a responsibility you didn\u2019t create, the family instead wants to shame you. JFC, that kid has zero chance with those people. Bless you and your husband for stepping up and giving a kid a better chance at life. Name him whatever you want, you\u2019re the one he\u2019s bonding with (and bless your father for stepping up too). Just watch the anger (\u201cshitstain junkie\u201d) - your kid will resent you for that later in life if you keep that up. Find your compassion and meet their hate with the love that drove you to stand up for that baby.", "NTA. Harsh but NTA. You are not a babysitter. Your are that boy's mother.

I would have been named after someone who used to party with my mom (while she was pregnant with me) and I am grateful my parents changed my name.

That boy is lucky to have you all.", "N T A for changing your child\u2019s name, but ESH because there was no need to stoop so low. You have the baby. You changed the name. The birth family has big feelings about it, understandable given their losses, both of their relative and of this child. You are safe, the baby is safe, and you have everything, while all they have are angry words. You could have ignored their rants and still kept everything you value, while not kicking them while they are down.", "NTA \n\nI can see why you don't have contact with them. Change your son's name. You are not changing what you call him, so I don't even see one reason why you shouldn't. Bless you for stepping up and taking him in. He is lucky to have you.\n\nCan you legally adopt him yet? Parental rights are terminated, but I honestly don't know how situations like this are handled.", "NTA, I would like to think your reaction was an attempt to protect him in some way. Like a \u201cwash away\u201d from his other life. I see it as a fresh start and those people coming after you for loving that baby. I would have flashed too.", "If they truly wanted to honor anyone, much less their own child, they would have put forth the effort to raise him. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Move on with your family. They can go kick rocks.", "NTA\n\nSo when they decide that you are the bad guy here is what you tell them:  Where were you all of this time?  Where were you when your sons were getting into drugs?  Where were you when they had this child removed so long ago?  Where were you when they had a set plan that would allow for them to get the child bacK?  Where were you when all of this first went down and it was clear that the birth parents were not even giving a dam about their child, to where it got to this point?  \n\nSorry you all lost the right to say anything about this, the day your sons tried and started to do drugs.  You lost it on the day that one of them died of an overdose.  You lost it on the very day that the child was removed by CPS.  You lost that right to say anything when it was clear that the parents were not concerned or wanting to do anything to get their child back.  In short you have no grounds to say anything about this.\n\nThen block them all and put them on a permanent ignore.  I would also suggest that you take additional steps, to include keeping all emails, text messages, and any other way they are sending you messages.  That you take notes when they call you.   Change the phone number and start looking at family lawyers who can represent you in court.   And here are the really important things:  When it comes to your children, password any and all things dealing with them, from medical and their doctors, to child care and schooling, where if they show up, they either are not able to get information but also can not take the children from the home.\n\nAnd one other thing, given the world and crazy people in there, please make sure you find guardians who are going to be able to take care of your children in the event that something were to happen to either you or your husband, get that down in a will.  Include in there that your son, is never to have any sort of contact with his birth family while he is a child and write down the exact reasons for it, everything.  Seal that up in an envelope and that way if your son asks, when he is older about such, hearing it from people, you can hand him the envelope and let him make the decision on such.", "Wow, so much to unpack there. I've been in your shoes. My son arrived with a name I hated I've always referred to him by a nick or a different middle name. CPS closed our case nearly 16 years ago because the parents opted to not visit, claimed we didn't allow visits, put the kids to bed too early, and petitioned for other ppl to take custody. All of the ppl were disallowed to get the kids cause they refused to follow safety plan.\n\nAre you planning to adopt him? If so you are fully within to name him whatever you want. As a guardianship position at least in my experience it is a bit different process. About the time you got your little one we petitioned to change my not-so-little man's name. We were successful but the bio parents had to consent.\n\nIn my opinion?  NTA.", "NTA. He is your son. I\u2019m guessing he has already had his surname changed?\n\nMy stepsister (giant waste of space) has lost all 3 of her kids. First went to her half sister (no legal connection with me). Sis changed the child\u2019s name. Partly because stepsister gave her one of those unique spelling etc.", "NTA.  Good for you - someone needed to step up for that poor little boy, and you did.  Someone needed to tell your husband\u2019s useless and enabling relatives exactly how it is, and you did.  Good for you!", "NTA.  Coming from an adopted kid, he is your son now.  Legally.  Name your son to be incorporated into your family.", "NTA.  \n\n\nAnd cut off access to the child to all of your \"relatives\" that attacked you.   Don't let them ever see the boy again.", "NTA\n\nThis is your child.\n\nYou can name your child whatever you want", "NTA - they forfeited any say when they refused rehab. They should be happy bubs is safe and loved.", "Okay, so this is a two parter. \n\nNTA for changing his name. You have every right to, and it sounds like you absolutely should. \n\nHowever, you really need to stop engaging with these people on social media. Whatever comments you have made, any Facebook or Instagram posts you might have made about this situation, or these people, you need to remove them. Seriously, remove them. Then block all of them. Stop engaging with these people. Stop letting them bait you. Because anything that *you* say online is admissible in a court of law. That even includes private DMs. So stop giving them anything they may be able to use against you now, or even down the road. Not only that, but you don't need your son to see those things when he's finally old enough to read them. So please, for the sake of your new little family, remove all of that and cut off all contact with those people.", "NTA. You are this baby's mom. He is one of your own. \n\nPlease contact a lawyer just to protect yourself and your son.", "NTA.  You are his true mother and no one can take that from you.

And go nc. Thank you for giving that child a chance.", "NTA. I fully support your decision about this. It would be different if he were older and used to his name. You've never called him his name though. This makes absolute sense.", "Well, in general, you are NTA.  However, you were probably more harsh than necessary, but I understand where that hostility came from \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA...

Enjoy that sweet little boy.", "NTA", "NTA If I were you I would drop off social media and start again in a new place many miles away from drama.", "NTA. You sacrificed to give this child a home and a great start and you have every right to change his name. John's family has done nothing to help, including not following the CPS care plan. They have no right to dictate what you name your child. You gave him a new name to honor the people taking care of him. Your son is lucky to have you, your husband, and your father in his life. Just block them and go on with your lives.", "NTA. Thee fuckith around, thee findith out.", "I know it's not an official vote, but Justified AH. \n\nYou aren't a babysitter. You are your son's legal parent because his parents and paternal grandparents have been deemed too dangerous to have custody of a child. And at this point, the parents rights have been permanently terminated and the paternal grandparents were never allowed to win a position to be granted rights. *There is no changing this at this stage.* The state has made the call that your son has a safe home and two parents who love him. So you've chosen to reflect that in his name, which your son will no doubt appreciate as he gets old enough to know the story of his birth and adoption.\n\nAt some point Steve's parents have to accept that their one son is gone, the other is likely to follow soon, and they are never getting their grandson back. They made choices, and those choices had consequences for them, their children, and their grandchildren. They don't get to take that out on you. Ever. And they might as well hear it from you because someone sure as shit needed to say it. And clearly, they didn't listen to the social workers.\n\nCut contact. There's no good that is going to come of their involvement in your or your son's life. And congratulations on finalizing the adoption, you sound like an amazing mama bear!", "NTA, you literally saved him from being neglected by his bio parents, don't want to imagine how his live would be with them cause they probably not gonna change.\n\nYour his mom and have the right to change his name.", "HOLY SH!T - that was pretty wretched.  I think your words were a bit over-the-top (no matter how true they probably are), but you just ignited the flame.  Sometimes saying nothing speaks louder.  Next time (and there will be one), show some grace and restraint, it's pisses them off more anyway.  NTA, and if none of these \"family\" members are in this child's life, they have zero input - and block them on your social media - all of them.  Good luck!", "NTA. They didn\u2019t do anything to support or step in, therefore they have no right to judge. You took that boy in out of the kindness of your heart when you didn\u2019t have to, even when you learned that his parents wouldn\u2019t go to rehab or set a plan. If they actually gave as much of a crap as you and your husband did, surely even they would have actually said or done something to pitch in before this happened. The last statement might come off as harsh to some but personally I say he\u2019s yours now so you should do what you think is best, because it\u2019s better than what any of them did. Plus coming from a person who\u2019s stuck with druggies both former and current and still has to live around the consequences until I can safely move out, I think he\u2019d be better off knowing he was re-named after good people.", "NTA. poor choice of words, but I bet you're an awesome mum.", "NTA you took in a baby and raised him as your own.  You\u2019ve had him for 2 years and neither of his parents have made any effort to deal with their addiction.  He is legally your son, you have every right to change his name.  I agree that naming a baby born to addicts shouldn\u2019t be forced to carry the name of a dead junkie.  You gave him a fresh start in life and that includes a new name.", "NTA. Was it harsh? Eh maybe. Or maybe they're just the type of assholes that wouldn't comprehend anything else but straight up facts. Am I proud of you? Yup. Those who don't help, don't get to say a mother effing word about what you do with YOUR son.", "NTA I feel like the language was not over the top, but instead geared to the audience. You spoke to trash with the words of their own people. On some level it is noble to meet people where they are at. Sounds like you have done right by your child. Name it however you see fit.", "Nope. NTA.\n\nName changes at adoption are super common, for lots of reasons. And the reasons are nobody's business except the parents.  I love that you included your daughters in the decision, and adopted your son as a family. What a beautiful gift you are giving to a child who could have been caught up in the system and suffered tremendously for the poor decisions of his birth parents.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you responded to the relatives in anger, but yeah, you're human and handled that poorly. A bit AHish for that, but they got what they deserved.

Block all those toxic people and move on with your happy family. When the parental rights of the bio parents were terminated through the Courts, the rights of those other folks to have an opinion about the baby\u2019s name were also terminated, imho.", "NTA\n\nIf they wanted to name the kid they should have gotten their crap together and raised them themselves.\n\nRather than appreciating your efforts, they are making vile accusations.

Never explain.\u201d\n\nI think it might be time to drop off social media. It is really non-of their business: either the name change or your thoughts on the previous Steven.\n\nWhen he is an adult, he can make up his own mind about that part of his bio family.

It will fill him with shame and self loathing and make him far more likely to feel different than your bio kids. \nAddiction is genetic. So there is a higher chance that he will struggle with that when he is older. If you have directly or indirectly told him that addiction makes you a lowlife, a sh*t stain and a burden on society he will have a hard time getting help. \nWouldn\u2019t you rather teach your son that his bio parents were very sick and chose to let him come to you because they loved him? Wouldn\u2019t it be better for him to understand that they were sick and couldn\u2019t find a way to get better but that lord of people can? \nObviously none of this needs to be addressed directly right now.

Its not a decision I regret. This beautiful boy is the light of my life but it was a major life change for us. Especially me as I was the one who gave up my job and my social life to be basically locked up isolated during covid with a baby. It was supposed to be temporary while they went to rehab. They never went to rehab nor complied with any of the safety plan set up by  CPS. From 2 months on they have not seen the baby nor supported him in any way. Johns family has not been involved either as they also refused to abide by the safetyplan or any of the CPS recommendations.\nNow 2 years later my husband and I have full legal custody and CPS has closed the file. We have put forth a petition to change the baby's name. At birth john and sue named the boy Steven to \"honor\" John's brother who died of an overdose (while partying with John and Sue who was PREGNANT and getting high) \nMy husband and I have never ever referred to the baby by that name. We always called him Davey (his middle name) after Sue and my husband's grandfather.\nSo instead of being Steven David Jones we are changing it to David Owen Smith. Owen is after my father who absolutely adores him and accepted him as grandson from day one.\nSo here's where I might have ventured to asshole. My husband thinks I went too far but I feel they pushed me to the end.\nJohn's family found out and blew up my social media and messaging.(not husbands just mine) Telling me that I have no right to change the name or honour my father because I'm nothing more than a babysitter and I'm not the real mother. I was called a babythief amongst more vile accusations. So I snapped and  responded back that MY son's names will honour good men that he could proudly emulate not like their junkie relative who was a shitstain on the world defrauding the govt for benefits and stealing from anyone he could and contributed nothing to life or society and his only accomplishment is that he odeed before he went to prison.

Many even venture as far as changing the child's SSN because their biological parents will take out debt under the child. Nobody blinks when a woman changes her last name to her husband's. Why should the biological parents have any say whem they provide no financial support, legal custody, no visitation, nothing.

Why impose it, when you dont know.", "You are absolutely right on one point: You cannot tell someone with an addiction to make a choice. \n\nBut addiction does involve choices.  If you, dear commenter, are right about everything else you have said, then you'd be the first person in history to help an addict overcome addiction who didn't first want help.

Surely you did not misconstrue my comment to mean that someone can stop being an addict with just one decision.

I wish I had the energy to laugh OR cry right now. \n\nIt was supposed to be temporary. CPS in most states tries to close cases within a year. Temporary. \n\nTen and a half years ago, while I was in a meeting with my phone off, my husband accepted custody of 7 of our grandkids. CPS gave him 5 minutes to decide, so waiting til my meeting ended wasn't going to happen. Yep, I asked the case worker later and she confirmed it.\n\nA tiny taste of the insanity of the family dynamic: I am the 3rd wife to my first husband. Hubby has 1 son with first wife and 2 sons with the second wife. First wife and son are several states away. Sons 2 & 3 are in our state but their mother is on another continent and not involved. I refer to my husband's sons as \"my sons\" and most of the time they like that. \n\nI have no children and I was adopted at birth by a mother who wanted me and a father + 3 siblings who didn't want me. It's been 53 years and they still mention it.\n\nMy family experience is strange, imo.\n\nThe children we took in are through our second son. His wife already had a daughter from her first husband (married and became parents at 16) but my son started raising the little girl when she was 1. Son and his wife then had 6 kids - 4 girls and 2 boys. It's NOT a religious thing. DIL is 2nd of 9 kids and wanted a big family, too. \n\nI'm going to skip about a billion details and just skip to the fact that the thing that allowed them to pursue destruction head on and do all kinds of strange, questionable things was crystal methamphetamine. I don't know if someone told them this as a joke or if was imparted in all sincerity, but it was truly bad Intel. Son and DIL believed that,  unlike depressants like alcohol that can make you black out, meth would speed you up but keep you clear headed so you could remember what you did. They seriously believed this. When all kinds of accusations of abuse and neglect came out, they both swore those things didn't happen. I finally gained some traction one time when son was swearing he would have remembered.  Me: you told me once that meth makes you feel like Superman. Son: so? Me: are you Superman? Son: no. Me: okay, so let's consider relying on someone else's memories. It was a helpful exchange. \n\nWhere were we when this was happening? Well, son and DIL lived about an hour north of us - about 3 counties away. At our house we had my elderly parents. Husband and I worked an hour south of our home. I didn't know that my husband had been training to compete in the Pseudo Olympic Sport of D.E.N.I.A.L. = (D)on't (E)ven k(N)ow (I) (A)m (L)ying. I was training as his spotter by being gullible and naive.\n\nThe grandkids were ages 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 14, and 16 when they came to us. My Mom had passed by that time, but my grumpy old Dad still lived with us. We weren't rich - just State employees. We had to get creative with sleeping arrangements. But we were really the only people willing to keep the kids together. \n\nSon went to prison. DIL went crazy. Told the kids to hate me, by her own admission. The kids were so messed up already. But to tell them to go live with someone you want them to hate? Why?\n\nOur claim to fame? Everyone is still breathing. But don't jinx it, okay? Let's leave it there for now.\n\nOP, I'm so glad that baby boy has you, your husband, and your girls. Whatever rituals or traditions or events make y'all feel like a bonded family, I say go for it. As for the birthparents et al, I understand your anger. But I would urge you to hold your tongue as much as possible.  When you let that crap fly out of your mouth, it changes who you are more than it affects them. \n\nNo matter what might come against you, do everything you can from a place of love. Easy for me to say, right? Not really. The love of the most amazing Mom on earth, 19 years of sobriety (29 now), a Bachelor of Social Work, a wonderful local support system, and my pitiful survival instinct were not even close to enough to combat the absolute insanity of addiction, generational trauma, and millions of confusing, unspoken expectations. This family is in tatters. I thought I was being loving. I was, actually, at first. But I ended up being accommodating to addicts with no boundaries and the children they taught to comply. \n\nThis explanation that is absolutely unnecessary to your decision making was brought to you by a horrid last few days and lack of cheesecake.

Disgusting. \nThe truth hurts sometimes and I don't see anything wrong with what you said.", "Wow! That was definitely a blow torch in response to their harassment but sometimes it takes fire to fight fire. NTA. It was the courts after 2 years and the biological parents failing to get clean and sober   while under CPS investigation that terminated their rights. The state found them to be unfit as this child's parents. You have every right as his legal guardians and parents to change his name. I do hope you tell your son age appropriate information about him being adopted as he gets older. Do not wait until he's a teenager. A counselor can help guide you with this.", "NTA. I changed my son\u2019s name. His birth mother named him in honor of his father yet his father never bothered to see him during a 151 day hospital stay, or learn how to care for his medical needs, or even show up to court. My husband and I refused to let our son be named In honor of someone who couldn\u2019t be bothered to parent him. Block anyone who pesters you about it and congrats on your son.", "NTA\n\nI hate the phrase and idea of respect for the dead absolving all the awful that they did while alive.\n\nSame with don't speak ill of the dead.\n\nHere's the thing you want respect you earn it. And you want people to not speak ill of you once you croak don't be a shitty person while alive.", "NTA. Also, junkie parents naming their baby after another dead junkie? That is not a legacy I would want to put on a baby; gods forbid he try to live down to his namesake.", "NTA.  You saved this kid from a world of despair.  Not only are you NTA, but you're a hero to someone, you are giving this kid a fighting chance.", "Hell no, NTA. Good response, they can't just insert opinions whenever they feel like.", "NTA if you hadn't saved him or cps hadn't, Baby would have probably died due to those people. Good on you!", "NTA and damn you are a savage. Let those mama bear claws out. No one is going to tell you what to do with your cub. I have been clean 15 years now and wished it wasn't so sugar coated for me back then. I needed someone to talk to me like that (didn't have a kid at that time but I mean just raw). I do however suggest that you get a restraining order. If they mention being a babysitter, I'd be worried about how far they would go. \n\nMy daughters friend (11y) and siblings (15y and 9yr) were just abducted by thier addict parents. They lost custody and were suppose to give the kids over to cps. They ran instead. It hit so close to home. My daughter was so scared for her missing friend. Sleepless nights and lots of tears. They found them a week later in a house with drugs accesable to the kids. Parents high as a kite. Please take no chances. Drug addicts are unpredictable and won't get clean until they are ready. Anything can happen.", "NTA.", "YTA\n\nYes they spoke up and said some vile accusations but you went to their level. You didn't need to. Imagine your son seeing what you wrote and the degrading way you spoke of his family of origin. \n\nThat was not well done and shows a lack of self control. There are worst things that you are going to have to deal with and if this is how you deal with it you are not going to make your child's life easier.\n\nThe things doctors and teacher will say when/if they know about your child's background. If you fly off the handle to mindlessly \"self defense\" when you need to be thinking strategically how will you accomplish the best for them.", "NTA. You scorched the earth and salted it after, and rightfully so. You are mom, period.", "Soft ESH. \n\nThey suck hardcore for very obvious reasons and you are NTA for anything regarding taking care of your child and changing their name. \n\nThe only thing that makes me say soft ESH is that you said this about their dead son who has nothing to do with this, rather than the kids\u2019 parents and grand parents who actually deserve those insults.", "Yeah, it seems like they care way more about their friend who passed away than their own baby. Instead of rallying and becoming fit parents they have disregarded all those responsibilities but fight for keeping that name.", "My girls are the same way. They love their name stories. They love stories about the people they are named after too. And now of course they like to tease about another baby brother or sister  and pretend argue about picking another name.", "I wish this comment was up top. Are the bio parents bigger jerks? Yes. Does that make this healthy? Nope!", "Yes! Also, this is his name you're changing. It is a part of his identity just like his birth family always will be. OP - you should wait until he is old enough and ask him if you can change the name. He may not want you to make choices on his behalf about his identity.", "Baby thief is also quite low. I\u2019m a big believer in if you open a can of worms you should be prepared for what comes out of it, addict or not. \n\nIf your going to open up the dialogue with some low blows then you should be prepared to hear them back. NTA", "[pigeon chess!](https://imgur.com/a/HSV7CS4)", "Love the \"playing chess with a pigeon\"", "This is my new go-to!!!", "Hell birth mother couldn't even stay off drugs during pregnancy.  How dare she now say she cared about her child.  We all know the side effects to consuming alcohol/drugs during pregnancy.  I have 0 sympathy for a person willing to risk the well being of HER CHILD for a fix.  Fuck her.", "There\u2019s a say in my country that goes \u201cm\u00e1s vale una vez colorado que ciento amarillo\u201d (best to be red one time than yellow a hundred more). \n\nYou can be gentle but sometimes truth needs to be said loud and clear. NTA", "Thank you very much for the kind thoughts. You know, I might be persuaded to move if cheesecake is involved! Lol", "Just because They went too far, doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t. She went even farther than them.", "The choice is the moment you decided to start in the first place. I have a LOT of addicts in my family, everything from alcohol to crack to heroin.  I made the CHOICE to set strict alcohol boundaries and to NEVER even once try crack or anything.  Once you start and addiction sets in, you can\u2019t just choose to not be addicted anymore, but if you have the opportunity to get help and choose not to, then that\u2019s a choice.  \n\nAnd you\u2019re enabling people by making excuses for them.", "Addiction isn\u2019t an easy thing to just \u201cchoose\u201d to get out of. You literally aren\u2019t in your right mind if you\u2019re high or constantly coming down from being high. It\u2019s kind of ridiculous to be like \u201cwhy isn\u2019t someone in the throes of addiction making a rational choice and getting help?!\u201d Because\u2026 they\u2019re in the midst of addiction.", "Is it a nice flag? It really needs to be a nice flag.", "It\u2019s so sad but when drugs are in the equation nothing works. Nobody is important if the addict does not have its dose, even the kids.", "Yes, this. I'd be afraid they would show up high and try to take Davey.", "Yeah, I just LOVE how people always want to provoke you and then get all shocked pikachu face and play the victim when you snap. Especially when other people then leap to their defense over it, like they expected you to just \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d and take it. \n\nYou mess with the bull, you get the horns. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You can't really save a dead guy and maybe not glorifying him will help ones that can be saved.", "So what, they just get to do and say whatever they want because they're sick? Not saying we should necessarily be punishing them for their addiction, but you have every right to tell them to fuck off and mind their business, especially when you're raising they're children for them.", "Depending on what drug they are addicted to, they will start picking at their face until they bleed and scab over, so slang and literal.", "Australia has that meaning too, but I haven't heard it for a while.", "I've never understood this mentality. Not everyone is good, a lot of people leave behind a trail of devastation from their time in flesh prison. Why in death do they deserve any better or respect they never gave in this life? There is a line, but really, if it's like dealing with kids. I'm not being mean because I'm telling the truth. You may not like the truth because it's ugly, but it doesn't mean it's false.", "That guy was a real knucklehead, let me tell you.", "That is exactly why I say there\u2019s limitations on it. Guys like Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, etc. don\u2019t deserve the respect in death that a normal person would.", "I agree .\n\nBut i also think that u/riskylifie has a good method to measure these people.. Place the burden to maintain / initiate contact on them - to show how serious they are.\n\nSad they are not - but lucky that due to this method, the child remains trauma free.", "Definitely not trauma free. No child coming from any family with drug use is ever trauma free. \n\nYes, the objective should be to protect the child first, but tbh you come off like the bio parents are choosing to abandon their children or that they don't love them. \n\nAddiction is a disease. We are a society. They need help, not judgement.", "\u201cNo one adopts a baby to keep it around for you to get ready to raise it.\u201d\n\nThat should be a disclaimer on every adoption.", "Exactly! I mean in OP's case if they really wanted to get their kid back they were told what to do but never did, so by not doing what CPS asked of them to have their child back they gave up their rights to their kids, their addiction was clearly more important than a child...\n\nOP NTA!", "Agreed - they need help.\n\nBut I also understand being hesitant to expose children to parents who are not 'clean' yet - so some way to prove they are would be in all parties best interest imho.", "Me too. Specifically, I hear grifter and I think of sawyer from lost.", "Funny how they only came crawling from under a rock when the name was changed. They are not his parents she is. I agree with you. If the harassment continues get a restraining order.", "That's so sad.  I was an addict (clean over 7 years!) But even at my worst, I never missed a single bed time phone call (even when I was in jail) or a single visit with my kids."]}
