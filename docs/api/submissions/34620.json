I asked what was the sudden change and he explained that he felt I was not home. then I explained how I'm busy with school work and going to the gym, but I will come home more often. then he said no the actual reason for pulling the funds is that I never help out. I Brought up that I help out when I can like coming back to grab packages for him, driving him 2 hours each way to go to an airport, taking him early in the morning to go to appointments, helping out with renovating his house and doing yard work (the only times I decline is when I have no time to make it). after that he changed the reasoning again saying I don't feel like paying somewhere close to $1000 a month ( This includes tuition, cellphone bill, and health insurance) on someone who I have to pull nails from to help (he will have last minute plans that I can't adhere to). I am worried that this will only hurt my school causing me to have less time to focus on school and needing to pick up even more hours at work. Because I would need to quit all my hobbies and earn at least $1000+ a month while doing school at the same time.\r  \n\n\nSidenote I asked if his decision was due to a financial situation or just his choice. he responded by saying its a parental choice.

I also do a lot to help out financially and around the house. the past 5 years, I rarely asked for help with clothes or products such as shampoo body wash toothpaste also recently my car insurance and even an expensive laptop I saved up for college was all my money. since I live with my gfs family he doesn't need to pay for any food, electricity, or water. I always tell him how grateful I am for him helping me and I appreciate that. before we discussed how I'm not home as often and he said he has no problem with it but I heard from my brother how my dad criticizes me a lot about me like the way I drive? and how my brother shouldn't gift me stuff because I'll sell it which I never had and how I'm never around anymore. all this makes me feel that he is trying to push me out of his life ASAP. But on the other hand, I am a legal adult and haven't been home as much as I used to and I have been relying on my dad for a few of the key parts of life which I can understand his perspective on. I also have family and friends telling me that I'm in the right and he's my dad and that he should support me. but after talking with him I also kind of feel like an asshole because I thought he was doing these things cause I'm his son but he sees it as a transaction and that I'm making a bad transaction with him.\r  \n\r  \nI just want to know if I'm being spoiled here by wanting support from my dad at 19?", "created_utc": 1704732533, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191plgi/aita_for_wanting_support_from_my_dad_at_19_years/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the hobbies are taking hours away from studying just like work would then how is he affecting his studying. He wants his dad to support him while living with his girlfriend's family. That's being unreasonable but it is his money and just because he has a good paying job and wants to drive a nice car and live in a nice house. Guess what? The sun had all that while he lived with his father. And all those expensive things have cost. Also. He's not abandoning the kid yet but OP has to realize he may have to step up a little bit more. And saying that he's living for free with his girlfriend's family and that he pays for his stuff but that has to pay for all the schooling. He needs to change his opinion a little bit\n\nI don't think OP is y t a that much but I think he's not completely NTA, and I don't think the father is y t a either", "You're not the asshole for wanting your father's financial support but he's under no obligation to give an adult child money or pay for your schooling. It sounds like if your father doesn't have a change of heart, you have to rework your budget, research student loans, apply for financial assistance and economize so you can afford the basics and school.", "NTA for wanting support from your Dad, but I suspect there is more going on here than meets the eye. As you said, it's odd that your Dad would pull support out of the blue when it appears he can clearly afford it...assuming everything else you said here is accurate (you're respectful, helpful, grateful, etc.). He obviously has *some* reason for this decision, right? Things like: Does he have a problem with your girlfriend and/or you living with her family? Any idea why he thinks you'd sell gifts from your brother? Does he have a problem with what you're studying in school or the grades you're getting? Has he always been one who is difficult to get a straight answer from?\n\n> I would need to quit all my hobbies and earn at least $1000+ a month while doing school at the same time.\n\nYou do come across as spoiled/entitled for this comment, though, since that's normal for many kids without rich parents (+/- going into massive debt).", "NTA. \n\n> My dad makes $300k+ a year has a $100k+ car and a $1m house\n\nThis is all anyone needs to know. Parents refusing to support their young adult children in this economy despite making this kind of money are the worst kind of selfish. This directly undermines your career by forcing you to do low-wage labour and focus less on school.", "I'm gonna say NAH\n\nI WANTED to give you the free and clear, but here's the scrub for me\n\n>I'll have to quit all my hobbies and make $1000 a month\n\nThis is a silly argument.  He's not obligated to pay for your life at all, much less in a fashion that sanctions for your life to be fun. \n\n> My dad makes $300k+ a year has a $100k+ car and a $1m house and went on expensive vacations 2-3 times in 2023.

How??", "NAH a lot of this sounds like normal tension between a child leaving the nest and a parent whose role is changing.   Your father sounds very frustrated, and I\u2019m guessing that a lot has happened that you\u2019re not sharing here.  \n\nIf you want to rely on your father\u2019s money, then it sounds like you\u2019re going to have to be more flexible in finding ways to help.  Yes, that may mean you have to change plans based on his needs and yes, you may have to cut back on all your hobbies in order to get an education.  It\u2019s temporary. You\u2019ll live. \n\nHe criticizes your driving?  Well, insurance rates are high for your demographic for a reason - 19 year old guys are often not great drivers.  So consider whether your father\u2019s criticisms are valid, because it\u2019s very possible. \n\nAnd yes - you\u2019re over 18.

You\u2019re depending on your girlfriend\u2019s parents AND your father. What happens if your relationship with your girlfriend goes south?  You\u2019ll need to move back home, right?  So it isn\u2019t smart to have a prickly relationship with your Dad. \n\nYour father\u2019s salary is irrelevant.  It is his.

Just because he can support you doesn't mean he should. He feels you should work for your money. Either by working for him effectively (which even if you are, is not up to his expectations) or working another job. \n\nSounds like he's doing what he thinks is best as a parent and you're still young.

Funding you is his own personal choice, no matter how absurd his reasoning of cutting the fund seems. I am unsure of whether your college has any support for this/ any governmental loans, but since you are an adult if you choose to continue your education you should get a loan and repay it after. I know it is financially tough for you but either you discontinue your education or you continue it with a loan or scholarship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour dad is the bigger AH here, however, if he requests you to help with such tasks and still is unappreciative of the fact that you did not even use his bills, not stay under his roof and still be happy to help him.

So do your parents *have to*? No. Can most of you get through without it- also no.\n\nAnd before redditors crawl up my ass- OP needs dad\u2019s financial information to apply for a FAFSA (federal financial aid paperwork required by most colleges) until he is 24. And he likely doesn\u2019t qualify because dad makes too much. So if dad cuts him off- his choices become more limited. \n\nSo- OP- you have a shitty shitty game to play. Which is how much to appease your father with whatever is going on with him vs figuring out how to do this on your own. \n\nI get not wanting to work while going to school- yeah- it sucks. But it is possible.\n\nYou need to go talk to your academic advisors, and someone in financial aid ASAP and tell them your dad is threatening to cut you off financially and you need to know your options for the specific program you want to complete. Don\u2019t be embarrassed or ashamed- you are not the first person they have heard this from, it is not your fault. They get this from students multiple times a week. \n\nYou need to find out if your current term is paid for or not. And if not how much you need to give them. \n\nAnd you need to make a plan. \n\nPersonally, if I were on my own again at 18/19, I would have done a 2 year degree at a community college that had a direct transfer into a top tier public college. It would have saved me thousands of dollars. But I was liberal arts all the way- so- your program comes into play here. I would also do jobs at corporations that will give you tuition reimbursement. Idk who does that now: but UPS literally had a shuttle full of students for the night shift from my college. But that was 20 years ago. \n\nTalk to your gf\u2019s parents. They may have insight.\n\nOnce you know all your options tell your dad what you are going to do. \u201cOkay Dad, since you are cutting me off my option to do this on my own is to drop out of x, and start going to local community college and then transfer back into x in 1-2 years. This jeopardizes my position in the pre-med (or whatever) program, but it is the only way I can do this as I don\u2019t qualify for student loans due to your income. My other option is to drop out altogether and join the military. Is this what you want?  And see what he says.\n\nBtw- if you are not on the west coast- and you are completely screwed- the direct transfer programs into the Uw and UC systems are really good, and as state schools go- UW is up there. I don\u2019t know as much about the UC and UO systems. It also only takes 1 year to get residency so you get in state tuition.", "The 2024 FAFSA has just opened (which is what determines aid access for the 2024-2025 school year).

We are both still on our parents phone plans, on their insurance (until 26), and occasionally receive help if we really need it. Obviously I would never expect help if they could not afford it.

Accounting for inflation\u2014minimum wage is equivalent to what it was in the 70s. But the cost of living has nearly tripled since then. For example, you could work 1000 hours in a year at a minimum wage job and meet the cost of living in 1975.

By doing that, he\u2019s making the father/son relationship transactional.
