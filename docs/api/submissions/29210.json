It sucked, straight up. \n\nFor work we wear HI-VIS jackets that are usually ~$600-800 per jacket. \nI wear a smaller size so it\u2019s around $650 for the jacket. \nThe jacket gets custom embroidery and stitching and tbh it looks really good. \nBut as all good work and quality, it\u2019s pricey.  all in my work jacket cost almost $800 at the end. \n\nNow, the company pays for all of this (as in the jacket, not the laundry service) but also offers laundry services for uniforms. \n\nI personally prefer to wash my own things at home, just because I like having extras on hand and not having to wait 5-7 business days for a turn around or be reliant on another company. \n\n\nSo my job moved me to a VERY HCOL area where my wife\u2019s parents live, first my wife and I were going to get our own place but her dad asked us to move in with them because they\u2019re getting older and could really use the extra help, both physically and financially. \n\nSo we have the upper floor and they have the rest of the place, arrangement works fine for everyone. \n\nWe share a kitchen and laundry and that about it. Usually eat together as the first one home from a standard day will usually cook. \n\n\nToday I came home and my work jacket was stained with mud and dirty, rinsing it off didn\u2019t work so I realized that I might actually have to wash it to get all the dirt stains out. \n\nSo I toss it in the washing machine, and select every option I could in cold water wash. \nHeavy duty wash, pre soak, extra spin, extra rinse and something else. \n\nMIL gets home and gets horrified at something, me thinking there\u2019s a leak or something comes to the laundry and she freaks out that someone put a single item (my work jacket) into the washer by itself. \nAnd not only that, but it\u2019s on a 2.5 hour cycle. \n\nShe goes bonkers about how I\u2019m \u201cusing up\u201d the washing machines ability to wash properly by abusing it like that. Then it leads to I\u2019m \u201cwearing out\u201d the components of the washer by putting it through the wringer like this. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t argue with her, I told her I apologize that she feels this way and that I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve somehow offended her by using the washer for my work jacket. \n\n\nShe\u2019s cherry tomato red and just leaves. She\u2019s walked out of the house and hasn\u2019t come back yet. It\u2019s been an hour. \n\n\nI personally don\u2019t think I did anything wrong as it wouldn\u2019t be an available setting if the machine weren\u2019t designed to run the cycle. \nBut AITA for \u201cusing up\u201d and \u201cwearing out\u201d the washing machine by only washing a single item on a 2.5 hour cycle ? \nPersonally I think she should be grateful and glad I\u2019m smart enough not to stick other \u201cbrights\u201d and whites into the wash with a mud stained jacket.", "created_utc": 1697685208, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17b98zq/aita_for_using_up_and_wearing_out_the_washing/", "score": 351, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn\u2019t have special powers that run out lol. Maybe she\u2019s concerned about the water waste but don\u2019t worry too much. I would say try and keep the long cycles to a minimum. Thanks for your service OP!", "I am not saying this is the case, but I am guessing that your MIL was worried about one bulky item creating an unbalanced load that can damage old school or cheaper washing machines. A longer cycle just means the unbalanced load is in there longer and has more time to shake/jostle all the moving parts in a way guaranteed to make the machine cranky over time. I think newer machines have better sensors and adjust their movements for loads like this but everything I just shared is based on offhand remarks my SO made while I kept him company when he fixed our washer a few years ago. I only remember bits and pieces as I wasn\u2019t paying much attention/he looked very nice bent over the washing machine and I was distracted.\n\nMy suspicion though is that your MIL is a little over sharing her home or just felt it more on that particular evening. \n\nIf you are reading comments OP, can you share a pic of this jacket? It sounds pretty cool!", "NTA, but i\u2019m wondering if this isn\u2019t about laundry or if she\u2019s struggling to share her home and this was the tipping point. I feel there is more behind her reacrion than just a load of laundry.", "I thought you were going to post that you'd thrown your shoes in the washing machine, since there's reasonable divided opinion about that.\n\nIf it's a modern washing machine, it'll automatically sense the weight and make calculations about how much water to use, how long to agitate and spin with what force, etc. \n\nThe issue isn't really who's right (you are, though), but that your MIL has a certain belief about stuff. And unless you can change that (you probably can't), you just have to figure out how best to work around it. \n\nNTA. Good luck to all of you navigating your IL's declining years.", "Based on a reply you made to someone else, she seems wary of what happened to someone else happening to her machine. But you didn't put in a full tool belt, you put in a single jacket on cold. Is it a small, old machine with a central agitator? Those could have trouble with a very bulky item. But if it's front load or has no central agitator, the machine can very likely handle it.\n\nGiven what happened to her friend's machine, you could explain you understand her concerns but you checked that this machine could in fact handle this jacket (at least I hope you did), and most energy is used to heat the water, which you weren't doing, and while the extra rinse does consume more water, it's still cold water.\n\nNAH, but subject to revision if the machine is old or there's a water shortage in your area.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA because MIL overreacted and it\u2019s not like the washing machine has a \u201ctotal amount\u201d of washes that can be used up before it breaks down\n\nIt sounds like you and your S/O contribute financially in the house and may be paying the water/electricity bill, so I will say a 2.5 hour cycle for 1 item is actually too much so it could be unnecessarily costing you a lot", "NTA \n\nYou aren't going to break, damage, or otherwise harm the washer by what you did. She is being quite the drama queen, tbh. You owe no apologies either. I would go a step further and ask for evidence that washing a jacket is going to shorten the washer's life span. It's not a thing that a washer has x number of cycles and then dies. \n\nAsk her if you should move out and let her figure out how to manage life without you and your wife there, because to me, this would be my htdo and she can either get over herself or manage on her own.", "NTA - BUT yeah, you were kind of wrong but not an AH. A 2.5 hour cycle for one item really is a waste and id be annoyed by that too. Her reaction was just way over the too though. Absolutely no need to flip out like that. \n\nYou really should just spot hand wash it or find a better dry cleaner.", "NTA. It's a washing machine. Washing clothes is what it was designed to do.\n\nThat said, if you're going to wash a single, bulky item, be sure to turn down the spin dry speed, because maximum speed with an unbalanced load will put unnecessary strain on the washer.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing, but offer to buy a replacement washer when this one breaks, so that she knows you actually do care about treating it well.", "NTA cuz you said they needed physical and financial help, i\u2019m going on a limb and hoping you pay your due and portion for pretty much everything you use. \n\nI have some expensive and delicate stuff and was it on its own, never for 2.5 hrs tho lol. So, i dont see a problem honestly.", "NTA, you were just trying to get it clean. Apparently, she would rather you put in other muddy clothes that need a deep wash to get clean. Would have been nice if she had told you so in advance. Now you know, do your laundry when she isn't likely to walk in and see the length of the cycle. Machines are made to run cycles that long, or it wouldn't be an option, as you pointed out. What wears them out the fastest is overloading them, but if that is her preference...\n\nEdited for grammer.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s laughable. It\u2019s a machine made to wash dirty clothes. Unless you\u2019re putting mud, stick and rocks in there, it\u2019s just doing what it was made to do\u2026Wash.", ">\"I apologize that she feels this way\"\n\nUm... That's not an apology. That is like the opposite of an apology. You did not apologize. One apologizes for what one did themselves. One does not apologize for how another person feels.\n\nYTA mostly for that. But YTA also for abusing a washing machine belonging to someone else, without an understanding of how the washing machine works, and how to do complicated laundry in it without breaking it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I don't think you understand what she was complaining about. Putting a single bulky item in the washer can cause the washer to shake itself apart. Every minute longer that you do that increases the chance that you are going to break the washer.\n\nShe isn't complaining about waste of time, water, or her washing machine's natural lifetime. She is worried about you breaking it.", "NTA it\u2019s a setting for a reason. However it is her washing machine so if she decides you can\u2019t run that cycle again, respect it.", "Nta. She sounds like hell to live with.", "NTA but consider getting a second washer JUST for those jackets. My roommate actually bought a new washer when she moved in due to her doing construction of just about every kind (except fencing...she retired from building those lol).", "NTA. Some things just need to soak and an extra rinse. It happens. MIL needs to calm down and realize that a washing machine is for washing things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
