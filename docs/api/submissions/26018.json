He wants to keep a relationship with him, he does not want to cut him off. My husband also can absolutely tell me he does not want to accept an invite, I may be a bit pushy at times, but if he doesn\u2019t want it, he will let me know and I\u2019ll respect it. Does it make it ok to be pushy? Absolutely not, I get that now. I never really viewed my behaviour as disrespecting my husband, but with your comment, I realize I have taken a \u201csavior\u201d role when it\u2019s out of line. \n\nFor context, My FIL never had a great relationship with my husband. He wasn\u2019t there during his childhood, never paid a dime of child support and that left some lingering resentment on my husband\u2019s end. They literally would go hungry at times. \n\nEver since we got married, I tried to have positive influence and make the relationship warmer, because I could sense his dad deep down cared about him, in his own weird way. I would invite them to dinner once a while, propose outdooors activities with them and always accept any invitation from them although sometimes my husband would want to decline. \n\nHis dad seemed to initially like me, but since maybe a year, he started hinting that I control his son (mainly cause he\u2019s jealous we spend more time with my family). Any chance he gets, he tells my husband (over the phone), that he needs to be the man, that he shouldn\u2019t accept that I go out with my friends (one a while) and leave him with the baby etc etc (old country mentality). We learned a few months ago that he has a serious disease and might have 5 years tops to live. So considering that, even though he irritates me, I try to be patient and nice to him. Actually I cried so many times since we learned the diagnosis, called him often, brought him soup, and just genuinely wanted to be present and be a support. \n\nSo anyway, the dinner. We were sitting and at some point he tells my husband he needs help in the backyard. He proceeds to tell him that last time his brother came to mow the lawn, and that it\u2019s now his turn. Then he looks at me and goes \u201cwell if Olivia allows you to\u201d. Then Im like what? What do you mean? And he goes \u201cwell who makes the decisions in the couple\u201d. I just said something like well he\u2019s free to do whatever he wants, kept quite for the rest of the evening, and the moment we were done eating we packed up and left without saying goodbye (only said bye to husband\u2019s brother and his wife). \n\nThe next day he calls my husband and asks what\u2019s wrong etc. My husband, who hates confrontation, just sais \u201cnothing\u201d. And we have been limiting contact since then. Tbh that comment was more of a cherry on the sunday type of thing, we were already fed up of his behaviour but were putting up with it since he\u2019s  sick. \n\nSo AITA for leaving abruptly without saying goodbye?", "created_utc": 1693570953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1675ngt/aita_for_leaving_dinner_after_a_comment_from_my/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't push the relationship, let your husband do the calling, invites, etc from now on. This is from my long experience with a huge extended  family on both sides, many of whom I saw get older, get chronic diseases, and pass away. When grumpy or bossy or self centered people get old and/ or sick, they do NOT have an epiphany and become warm, loving and considerate. They get grumpier, more bossy, more self centered, and even more irritating to be around! There is no death bed reconciliation. Whatever your husband experienced in childhood, you will see behavior twice as bad on display as the FIL ages and becomes more ill.

I'm in a similar situation with my wife, she has a very difficult relationship with her mother that I won't really get into. I think the important thing is to back your partner's wishes and support them in their decision.

I think that's not your place to make that decision for him. Similarly, I would not try and force my wife to interact with her mother because I know it gives her a lot of anxiety and really stresses her out. I understand that you have good intentions and that it's hard not to want to try and help mend what you think should be an important relationship.
