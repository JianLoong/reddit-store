After all she's claiming her bf is abusive but apparently still prefers staying with him then moving to live with her mom, and is roping you into this lie by claiming you're forcing her to stay in a situation she absolutely COULD leave but chooses not to.", "INFO: Can you feasibly take her in, or is this out of spite? \n\nSeems like she is in danger and needs your help. If you think her relationship is bad you should be more than willing to help her out. She is 23, which to me is still pretty young and immature.", "What does your husband want? SD is still very young. It is not unusual for kids in their 20s to live with their parents. When someone turns 18 they aren't magically adults who don't need parents. Parenting is a lifelong commitment. If it were my kids I would be disgusted by your sentiment and drop you for my young adult kid in a second. YTA.", "YTA. Why was she badmouthing you? Why do you not say 'step-daughter'? Why does she have such low standards of men? \n\nYou sound like yet another unloving and negligent step-parent who just wants to have sex with her dad.", "NTA.", "NTA. Make sure to VERY subtly let people she might complain to that the house you and her dad live in is >>>>YOURS<<<<<.", "Look NTA, but you are going cut off your nose to spite your face. \n\nThis might be a chance to set some boundaries around behaviour and an apology in return for her being able to stay for 3-6 months to get back on her feet. \n\nThere needs to be a clear understanding that this is a step to improving your relationship and if her doesn't respect you,  or you find out she is talking shit about you,  her stuff will be boxed up and sent to her mothers. \n\nOh and if she is still in contact with dead beat her stuff will be sent to his house.", "Agree NTA", "They live in a multi million dollar mansion, as OP commented somewhere here. So they could really well take her in.\n\nI am shocked at the amount of comments agreeing with OP. As someone who was a victim of an abusive relationship, well in my 30s, I was very happy to have family to turn to when I realized the situation I was in. Many of them had tried talking to me before too, but it is the nature of a manipulator and abuser to make you doubt your sources of trust and your own feelings. I was not able to understand their words in the way they intended, as I was under the influence of the abuser who had told me that all of my problems were rooted in my good relations with my family and that I need to be fighting with them in order to break the cycle and grow out of my problems. So whenever I was inclined to agree with something my family said, I was told that this is my \"old self\" trying to break free and I should ask myself why I hadn't grown out of it yet.\n\nRealizing this person was bad was very difficult and the only way to get away from the influence was basically to flee the place before they could lure me in again.\n\nI think that, even though OP has helped the stepdaughter several times in the past and she seems to make bad decisions repeatedly, that she should not be forced to continue living in that situation. OP said that moving to her mother would be an option, but not everyone can move states easily.\n\n I think taking the stepdaughter in with very clear boundaries should work: pay for her room, set a limit of time until she has to be moved out, she has to buy and prepare her own food... Things like that. You can help someone out of a bad situation without having to go all the way to cater to them. But really don't let her stay there any longer.", "Since you\u2019ve been down this road with her before and she clearly took advantage of you, she has forfeited any chance to ask to move back in. She\u2019s not just an asshole in this instance, she\u2019s a chronic asshole who expects you to fix her bad decisions.", "I really do think what is missed is how many time I have actually bailed her out. \n\nI litterally cleared her debt as a Christmas present. Until she dropped out I was paying her tuition. She has lived 2ith us multiple times. \n\nSo yeah. I am not going to let her live off us in a multi million dollar home, when her mom is offering her a safe place. \n\nHer mom is in an apartment in Tulsa. \n\nAlso, the money I have is the money my first husband intended for our son, not the daughter of the man I married.", "Good!  She\u2019s young and this is a very important lesson she\u2019s going to learn. I can tell you care for her even though she\u2019s treated you terribly. It\u2019s very hard to let someone you care about learn from their mistakes but it\u2019s vital for their future decision making skills. I\u2019ve seen 2 people just waste their lives and come to a horrible end because parents kept bailing them out. It\u2019s not easy but very very necessary. \u2764\ufe0f", "My friend got in to 10k+ debt in her 20s. Her parents did NOT bail her out.  Her parents are probably waaaaaay more well off than you.  My friend ate beans for a while lived in crap places where I had to walk up 5 fucking flights to see her but she put her big girl pants on and adulted.   They could've paid for her stuff but they didn't. \nYou know what they did pay for? A fair chunk of her down-payment on her house (after she got out of her debt) and they bought her a new car when she had a baby bc she was still driving a car so old you had to roll the gd windows.  \n\nHelp with a net, not a trampoline.   Net has holes.  She'll figure it out faster if her support net has big big holes.", "When does it end though? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re done financially supporting her and Your Hubby can\u2019t keep supporting her, She\u2019ll never learn to be self-sufficient.", "In the last 6 months she moved out of an affordable apartment and into a more expensive one w/an unemployed guy 7 yrs. older than her. Not a lot of growth there", "I think she gets off doing it because look at all the comments acting like I am a horrible person. Litterally one person said \"but its tulsa!!!\" like it was wrong to expect her to live there and I was a bad person for doing so. \n\nI am so glad my son, who has been through so much in his life, isn't this entitled. \n\nDo I dislike her? Absolutely at this point. \n\nBecause one of the things I don't talk about here is my son, who had to watch his dad die, and doesn't act this entitled.  \n\nAnd the house and money is just as much his as it is mine. Its more his. All of it goes to him if I die, because that is what his dad wanted. \n\nHis dad set up this trust so people like my husband and his daughter don't get what he intended for us. \n\nI have to respect that. My husband respects that."]}
