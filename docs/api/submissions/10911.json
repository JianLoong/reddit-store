Because she is her mom...\n\nShe doesn't want to move to another state to live with her mom. \n\nI think part of it is also that her mom lives in an apartment and we live in a large house worth a few million with a pool and game room and lots of toys. \n\nBasically, I'm wealthy and her mom is not.", "My first husband died after fighting brain cancer for years. We have a son. Before he died he set up a trust for my son and I to be taken care of. \n\nThis money is for my son in the end. When I pass, the house and money goes to my son, not my husband, because that is what he wanted when he set it up. \n\nIt isn't even my money to give away honestly. \n\nMy husband knew all of this going in. \n\nHe makes around 70k a year. \n\nThe house is a multi million dollar house. \n\nPart of the reason he doesn't have much left is because he pays a lot of her bills already.", "Its a 1 br, and she is probably going to have to evict him.", "*correcrion, it is a studio", "How is zero tolerance going to work? They toss her out so she goes whining to her family until they bully OP into taking her back in again?", "Oh please, if his name is not in the mortgage and they don\u2019t join finances, he is in fact a \u201cguest\u201d. His daughter is an adult perfectly capable of dealing with the consequences of her own actions. Why should the living situation of an ungrateful and two-face brat be OP\u2019s problem? Lol she doesn\u2019t owe her anything after the way she treated her", "Did you miss the part where she is choosing to not live with her mom?", "What does her being her mom have to do with anything isn\u2019t your guest her father ?", "OP should allow the daughter back in but is within her right to enforce reasonable rules. \n\nNot leaving strange Tinder dates at home alone with OP is a zero tolerance enforceable rule IMO.", "Don\u2019t use soy accounts op it\u2019s against the rules", "Who cares ? It\u2019s not like you care if his kid lives or dies", "Yup, I don't allow guests to move people into my house.", "Again, what do indo when it happens? Because she was told it was a rule 2 times last time and continued to do it.", "This is exactly what experts tell parents going into second marriages to do: to keep property separate and be clear from the beginning what belongs to who and live accordingly. OP is being wise with this approach and protecting her son\u2019s inheritance, and the husband agrees, as well. No need to cast aspersions on a situation that is being handled with more foresight than most second marriages.", "Lol I mean, of she wants to die instead of moving in with her mom that's on her"]}
