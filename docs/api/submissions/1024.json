Or was he just happy to know she is somewhere safe and secure?", "NTA. It's one thing to walk away and want space. It's a completely different thing to act like a child, give the complete silent treatment, and not even send a text saying \"I'm alive, stop bothering me\".\n\nYour SIL is toxic. Maybe her husband is, too. But she made you complicit in her toxic and childish behaviour. As long as you have no reason to think her husband is abusive as well (because your SIL sure as hell is) then you've simply let him know is wife is safe and secure.", "Considering g she does this often that tells me that her husband isn\u2019t abusive but she is mentally abusive not telling him where she is. There is a difference between needing space and worrying your partner. She was just trying to out him in emotional pain. To avoid this in the future (there will be a future) if she wants to have time at your house she needs to be clear with him where she is. ESPECIALLY when the baby arrives. She cannot do that. \n\nYour husband needs to understand that what his sister is doing is NOT ok and really abusive. He shouldn\u2019t stand behind that. \n\nNTA", "Maybe it time you too a  spa weekend and didnt tell your husband and see if he understand now  why you told him.   Or just spa day .", "Nta \n\nShe's throwing a tantrum like a toddler", "NTA. Your SIL is toxic if she can\u2019t even tell HER HUSBAND where she is going, argument or not.", "NTA - SIL sounds very mature /s. She was literally hiding & wanted her husband to worry. And using your house to do it. You have no horse in this race so telling husband she is safe is not a big deal.", "NTA - quite messed up they are expecting with this kind of behavior & shenanigans, your SIL is toxic and quite an abuser, no one should enable her doing so.", "NTA.\n\nUsually it's crossing a boundary when you tell someone else a person's location that they haven't revealed themselves, but in this context, I think it was warranted.\n\nYour SIL sounds exhausting. She's pregnant with a child and she just disappeared on her husband due to a fight. I don't even know what the context of these fights are but her reaction is incredibly petty.", "NTA\nYour SIL and Husband sucks.\n\nShe got her space at your house even if her husband know where she is", "NTA - nobody should be supporting her behavior of leaving him to wonder where she is.", "Unless she was worried about abuse, NTA.", "NTA. We're talking about a pregnant woman here. The husband has the right to know where she is. That's called being a concerned spouse.\n\nHonestly, running away from home everytime you fight with your spouse just shows how immature you are but hey, to each their own. If she wasn't pregnant, then you might be a soft AH, but she is. At least now, her husband knows that she's safe. God knows how long it'll take your SIL to get over the argument with her husband.\n\nYour husband said you should've stayed out of it but in the end, admitted that he would want to know where his wife is. If your SIL stays over at your place whenever she has a row with her husband, you should have a talk with him about it. You can't stay out of her marital affairs if she's constantly looking for you guys as an escape.", "NTA your sil needs therapy. People need space from their partners when they are mad, but letting them worry for an indeterminate amount of time out of spite is not healthy.", "NTA he at least wanted to know she was safe.", "NTA.\n\nHim knowing where she is doesn't have shit to do with space. And you're not required to lie for her if you don't want to. I'm not sure how you divulging that she's at your place is being unsupportive of her, it was an A and B conversation between you and her husband.  She needed to C her way out of it.\n\nAnd now she probably won't want to hide away at your place anymore if she really wants it kept secret because she won't trust you to keep the secret.  So the drama stays out of your household. I personally think it's pretty crappy of her to keep her whereabouts secret if she's staying gone more than an hour. She can blow off steam away from him while also not making him worry about her.", "NTA but that SIL sure is. She is basically doing a form of abuse on him.  Repeatedly.  She needs space, that\u2019s one thing. But it seems she enjoys causing him torment by not knowing where his pregnant wife is. That\u2019s just wrong.", "NTA. Your SIL is dragging you into her marital issues.", "ESH. Your husband is right. You don't know what happened between them, if there was violence, threatening, if she was scared for her life, or if it was something small. If you told an abuser where his victim was hiding, and something bad happened to her, you'd never forgive yourself. She's the AH for putting you in thst situation.", "ESH\n\nAs others have said, you could have simply said she was safe and left it at that.\n\nBut, SIL is potentially the biggest AH (provided he is not abusive). What does she plan on doing when the baby cries and she gets mad? is she going to take off and leave the poor kid alone?", "NTA\nI think OP would have heard about genuine safety concerns (abuse, violence) from SiL so I don\u2019t see a safety violation here. The reported reaction supports this.\nIt is not clear that anything would have really changed about SiL husband harassing more knowing where she was- but knowing she is safe means everyone else is not getting harassed. Ideally SiL would be encouraged and would at least confirm she is okay. Being concerned about pregnant wife makes sense.\nOP can agree to never do this again if the husband crosses the line.\nYou can\u2019t \u201cstay out of it \u201c when SiL has already involved you without your consent.", "ESH- \n\n\nShe sucks for ghosting him. \n\n\nYou could've told him you are in contact with her and she is safe and healthy. \n\n\nThis behaviour is not new. Him acting all surpised and assuming something happned seems dramatic to me. \n\n\nHusband is obviously the least ahole.", "Soft YTA. You have no idea of the workings of their relationship or whether there\u2019s anything else going on to make her not want to be around him. You could\u2019ve just told him she was safe and staying with a friend, rather than letting him know her location.", "YTA.  You could have simply told him she's somewhere safe, healthy, she just needs some space - WIHTOUT telling him where she was.", "YTA. Yeah, definitely should have stayed out of it and supported the pregnant lady.", "INFO- did her husband call you to ask or did you reach out on your own? Also has he shown up to your house looking for her? \n\n\nShe sounds really immature to be having a baby with her husband tbh. You probably shouldn\u2019t put yourself in the middle of it lol\n\nI\u2019m gonna go with NTA for now", "YTA \n\nYou say it\u2019s because your SIL is angry at her partner, what if there\u2019s more going on that you don\u2019t know about and she left because she felt unsafe? \n\nIf someone feels the need to hide, let them.", "NTA. SIL is acting immature and childish, getting angry and running away to hide. Punishing her husband by withholding her location. This is not how someone who is about to be a parent should act. Urge her to seek therapy before she starts ditching her annoying/loud/needy baby /s. She needs new coping, communication, and conflict resolution skills.", "YTA. People like you are how women end up dead or beaten until they miscarry. You should have just refused to house her instead of getting into things you don\u2019t understand", "NTA Assuming you know there\u2019s nothing serious going on between them and he isn\u2019t an abusive villian, her behavior is extremely childish and I would have trouble supporting THAT.", "From a safety perspective YTA. We don\u2019t always know someone\u2019s situation re:domestic violence. In this situation a better response would be \u201cwe\u2019ve heard from SIL and she\u2019s safe\u201d. It\u2019s better to err on the side of caution in these situations.", "Interesting how everyone assumes that he's abusing her when OP just said she was angry with her husband.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are you concerned for your safety?  Do you need our help to leave him?\"\n\nIf she answers \"Yes\" then you can help her.\n\nAnd, if I suspect she will, she answers \"No\" then you should tell her that she is welcome to stay with you for as long as she needs to.  However, she needs to stop dragging you and the rest of your family into her marriage troubles.  And having her husband ring the family because he can't find her is dragging you all in.  I hope you can find a diplomatic way to say that though.\n\nPersonally, I think your SIL is enjoying the power she has and is punishing her husband by making him worry.  And the reason she is angry with you is because you put an end to her game this time round.  Please have a conversation with your husband about this.  It's really very cruel.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

If she decided a to bring that into your household, your allowed to deal with her behavior in whatever way is best for the peace of your home. She shouldn\u2019t involve people in her drama if she doesn\u2019t want to deal with the repercussions. Holding someone hostage emotionally is disgusting and erodes your relationship.", "NTA.

I would have done the same as you.\n\nHow can a grown person be acting like this? Like a child using silent treatment and make everyone so scared and filled with anxiety for her safety?

Seems like the answer could have been \"I don't want to get involved\"", "Firstly this posts deals with a woman so my response is specific to that. I don\u2019t know how gender politics are relevant. Domestic violence and child abuse are not the topic, I\u2019m speaking about these specific facts including a woman hiding from her husband.\n\nSecondly many people are abused without their nearest relatives knowing. That\u2019s why the neighbors and family give interviews about how \u2018they never saw it coming\u2019 and \u2018they were such a lovely couple\u2019.\n\nThirdly hiding from someone after an argument, refusing to speak to them or tell them where you are is not \u201cclearly abusive\u201d.
