It's a completely different thing to act like a child, give the complete silent treatment, and not even send a text saying \"I'm alive, stop bothering me\".\n\nYour SIL is toxic. Maybe her husband is, too. But she made you complicit in her toxic and childish behaviour. As long as you have no reason to think her husband is abusive as well (because your SIL sure as hell is) then you've simply let him know is wife is safe and secure.", "Considering g she does this often that tells me that her husband isn\u2019t abusive but she is mentally abusive not telling him where she is. There is a difference between needing space and worrying your partner. She was just trying to out him in emotional pain. To avoid this in the future (there will be a future) if she wants to have time at your house she needs to be clear with him where she is. ESPECIALLY when the baby arrives. She cannot do that. \n\nYour husband needs to understand that what his sister is doing is NOT ok and really abusive. He shouldn\u2019t stand behind that. \n\nNTA", "Maybe it time you too a  spa weekend and didnt tell your husband and see if he understand now  why you told him.

Your SIL is toxic if she can\u2019t even tell HER HUSBAND where she is going, argument or not.", "NTA - SIL sounds very mature /s. She was literally hiding & wanted her husband to worry. And using your house to do it. You have no horse in this race so telling husband she is safe is not a big deal.", "NTA - quite messed up they are expecting with this kind of behavior & shenanigans, your SIL is toxic and quite an abuser, no one should enable her doing so.", "NTA.\n\nUsually it's crossing a boundary when you tell someone else a person's location that they haven't revealed themselves, but in this context, I think it was warranted.\n\nYour SIL sounds exhausting. She's pregnant with a child and she just disappeared on her husband due to a fight. I don't even know what the context of these fights are but her reaction is incredibly petty.", "NTA\nYour SIL and Husband sucks.\n\nShe got her space at your house even if her husband know where she is", "NTA - nobody should be supporting her behavior of leaving him to wonder where she is.", "Unless she was worried about abuse, NTA.", "NTA. We're talking about a pregnant woman here. The husband has the right to know where she is. That's called being a concerned spouse.\n\nHonestly, running away from home everytime you fight with your spouse just shows how immature you are but hey, to each their own. If she wasn't pregnant, then you might be a soft AH, but she is. At least now, her husband knows that she's safe. God knows how long it'll take your SIL to get over the argument with her husband.\n\nYour husband said you should've stayed out of it but in the end, admitted that he would want to know where his wife is.

And you're not required to lie for her if you don't want to. I'm not sure how you divulging that she's at your place is being unsupportive of her, it was an A and B conversation between you and her husband.  She needed to C her way out of it.\n\nAnd now she probably won't want to hide away at your place anymore if she really wants it kept secret because she won't trust you to keep the secret.  So the drama stays out of your household. I personally think it's pretty crappy of her to keep her whereabouts secret if she's staying gone more than an hour. She can blow off steam away from him while also not making him worry about her.", "NTA but that SIL sure is. She is basically doing a form of abuse on him.  Repeatedly.

Your SIL is dragging you into her marital issues.", "ESH. Your husband is right. You don't know what happened between them, if there was violence, threatening, if she was scared for her life, or if it was something small.

She's the AH for putting you in thst situation.", "ESH\n\nAs others have said, you could have simply said she was safe and left it at that.\n\nBut, SIL is potentially the biggest AH (provided he is not abusive).

The reported reaction supports this.\nIt is not clear that anything would have really changed about SiL husband harassing more knowing where she was- but knowing she is safe means everyone else is not getting harassed. Ideally SiL would be encouraged and would at least confirm she is okay. Being concerned about pregnant wife makes sense.\nOP can agree to never do this again if the husband crosses the line.\nYou can\u2019t \u201cstay out of it \u201c when SiL has already involved you without your consent.", "ESH- \n\n\nShe sucks for ghosting him. \n\n\nYou could've told him you are in contact with her and she is safe and healthy. \n\n\nThis behaviour is not new.

You could have simply told him she's somewhere safe, healthy, she just needs some space - WIHTOUT telling him where she was.", "YTA. Yeah, definitely should have stayed out of it and supported the pregnant lady.", "INFO- did her husband call you to ask or did you reach out on your own?

SIL is acting immature and childish, getting angry and running away to hide. Punishing her husband by withholding her location. This is not how someone who is about to be a parent should act.

I wouldn't let her in my home anymore and immediately text your BIL and tell him you saw her but did not let her in so go find his childish wife somewhere else and leave you and your household out of their mess. Heaven help this child being brought into the world by this woman.", "NTA. She is very immature and childish and I feel sorry for you and her husband.", "Sounds like such a fun marriage.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. She needs to be mature too. She wants space that\u2019s fine but being pregnant; she should have told her husband where she was.", "NTA - you sister needs therapy ASAP before she has a child because she is acting like a SPOILED BRAT! How old is she, because this is what little kids do when they are mad at their parents, whether rightly so or no!  Adults, work through the problems and not run away from them; I would also like to know why she was mad at him?  Is he abusive, if not running away is extremely childish and I fear for that child's sanity!", "NTA her doing this is abusive behaviour, her doing this when she is carrying a baby is horrendous, if she does this and takes the child with her she should expect to have the police looking for her not just her husband.  She can get space without using disappearing as a punishment, because that's what her behavior is doing.", "NTA but not 100% sure though. \n\nReally black and white: she comes to your house and your space. You have every right to be open about what's happening in your house, unless it would do harm to other people.\n\nI just want to say, her husband may be super toxic and harmful, and then she legitimately could need some place out where he wouldn't find her... Her being pregnant and him potentially being harmful is an even more nasty combination. You maybe don't know what their problems may be about and how severe they might be. I mean: her husband might even be very nice and considerate to you guys but not so much to his wife once she gets home...", "NTA. Sorry but it sounds quite childish. I don\u2019t like something so I will run away where you can\u2019t find me. Unless there is abuse or cheating, it\u2019s sounds like a lot of toxic drama. Your SIL needs to grow up. By telling your BIL where she was he could be calm in the knowledge she is safe. For her to want him to panic about her constantly to teach him some lesson is a giant walking red flag. She needs to grow up and you both need to stop enabling this shitty behaviour. You can stay here but that man needs to know unless there is a serious reason for him to not be aware.", "Ask sister in law what she would expect if her husband just stopped looking for her and her car went if road and she froze to death in a ditch because nobody looked for her?   Ask her how she will handle it when her child follows her model years from now and simply walks out the door and disappears for days whenever there is an argument.\n\nAsk her if she even watches the news these days.  \n\nPerhaps her husband should report her missing to the police every time.", "ESH. She sucks because her method of \"dealing\" with conflict is immature and unsustainable, especially considering she's having a child.\n\nHer husband shouldn't be freaking out and blowing up everyone's phones assuming the worst when this is a known pattern of behavior from her. He should have addressed this issue with her ages ago.\n\nYou had no need to tell him her location if she chose not to disclose it. All you had to do was tell him you knew she was safe.\n\nYour husband shouldn't be enabling his sister's tantrums.", "NTA She still has her space. He is not worrying about her safety. It sounds like your sister in law wants him frantic with worry which isn't right.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't want you involved but wanted to stay with you and wanted you to lie to her husband. Well you WERE involved and couldn't 'stay out of it'.\n\nAlso your husbands response is at best lukewarm. 'I didn't want you to do it but if it was me I would.' Make your mind up hubby.", "YTA. You don't know what's going on behind closed doors. It's best to stay out of it. I've had to do this for my own sanity and safety. If BIL will not stop arguing and keeps harrassing her and pushing her buttons then sometimes grabbing your keys and immediately leaving is the only thing you can do. At this point BIL knows that that is what she does to cool off, so does everyone else. She's staying at a family/ friend's house or a hotel, not missing. Him freaking out and calling everyone is bizarre... she hasn't left the country or the city. Let her cool off, no need to freak out.", "Thank you! I feel like the fact that this is her go-to MO when they fight means he shouldn't be automatically assuming the worst when she does it yet again.", "Either OP could have stayed out of it, or she skills have supported SIL. She can\u2019t do both. Either she stays out of it, meaning that she\u2019s ENTIRELY out of it, ie, not hosting SIL when she\u2019s in a snit because she argued with her husband, not studying with either person, and telling the SIL and BIL to solve their problems themselves, or SIL gets to stay at OP\u2019s, but opens herself up to OP being involved. She can\u2019t have it both ways", "Definitely NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t an issue with her needing space.  This is her wanting him to panic and imagine the worse case scenarios so that way when she does return he\u2019ll be more grateful that she\u2019s safe vs everything else.", "It sounds like the husband is respectful and responsible. (Not saying he's perfect, but there *is* a risk he's abusing his wife and this suggests that isn't the case)\n\n  Especially if he doesn't usually blow up the phone and only did due to the added health risk.  And it sounds like that's the case.\n\nThe sister in law sounds really horrible. Your husband should consider refusing to play a part in her bullshit.", "I second this. I grew up in a household where every time my mother would get angry, stressed, or things weren't going her way, she'd grab her keys and leave for a few hours. It was emotionally devastating to witness and wonder if your mom was coming back. It also massively messed up the way I used to view disagreements between partners. Thank goodness for a good therapist and a patient ex-boyfriend who helped me overcome that.", "I softly disagree that it is no longer a \"safe space\", since nothing says anyone would let the husband into the house, and if he's actively stalking her down, he's going to know to check their house whether he knows for sure if she's there or not.\n\nThat said, just because she's carrying his child doesn't mean she should be 'tracked', so to me it's more of a \"this isn't how I would expect adults to handle a conflict/time out situation\" on the part of SIL and her marriage...", "Signs would be there for sure and it seems like the wife is the toxic person - if she trusts this sister enough to go there, believe me she would tell her!  I did not read the OP said there were any signs of abuse, just the sister being toxic!", "Leaving a stressful situation is NOT at all immature though - sometimes thats the only we can get clarity, to center ourselves or just need a break from the other person(s).  I have left the house before and sat at the beach, praying, crying, venting, reading, sleeping, walking etc.  but I do let my loved ones know that I am leaving before I say something I might regret or just need to leave for my sanity.

Why is HE dragging the entire family into this??", "> We're talking about a pregnant woman here. The husband has the right to know where she is. That's called being a concerned spouse.\n\nBecause she's pregnant, he has the right to know where she is?? Really??

Freaking out as if she's disappeared for no reason is called being a controlling spouse.", "I'm going to guess the guy was more worried as opposed to being 100% convinced something bad happened to her.  And you never want the one time you assume everything's fine to turn out to be the one time something DID happen.    \n\n\nI hope the SIL is not someone who regularly threatens self-harm during relationship disagreements.  That would make the guy's worry and anxiety much worse.", "But no one can possibly know if there is abuse!!! So why is SIL getting automatically lambasted?? She has left the house before, she cools off, she comes back. He doesn't have to know exactly where she is at all times.", "BIL could be abusive. Or he can be harrassing her to her breaking point. OP doesn't know so she should stay out of it.\n\n\"Oh hi BIL. I'm not comfortable getting involved but she probably just needs to cool off.\"\n\nNo reason to go \"Hi [potential abuser], yes she's here. I'm glad I could help you control where she goes and who she's with! Have a great night [abusive husband]!", "I agree. I thought his behavior was a big, red flag to controlling and abusive behavior. OP never said why she was angry at him.", "No one, including OP, knows what's going on behind closed doors. Abusive or not, if BIL will not stop arguing after SIL calmly tells him to \"please stop\", to please let her be alone to cool off, then leaving can be the best thing to do.", "I disagree.

There aren't bright neon letters when someone's being abused. Abusers are master manipulators. They can be charming, kind, funny, level headed. He'll tell everyone she's acting crazy and has \"pregnancy brain\" and everyone will say ya she's the crazy one. And now she gets abused and controlled even more because he has to punish her for trying to uncover his abuse.", "If you go stay in someone else\u2019s home because you\u2019re in a snit, you are involving them in the issue.

It is NOT toxic to leave if you are at your absolute breaking point or need to cool down.", "I'm not saying he's abusive. I'm saying there can be no signs at all of abuse.

An entire sub of strangers think BIL is such a caring and concerned husband and SIL is an uncaring, manipulative wife. Without meeting either person. BIL is the victim here... sure... Abusers are charming; they are expert manipulators. Abusers are also smart. So, no, there aren't usually super obvious signs and, no, SIL would not tell OP if there's abuse.", "Well, thing is, if she doesn't want her husband to know where she is *because she's afraid of some imminent danger* that's a very different situation to her wanting her husband to not know specifically because she wants him to freak out, which is *itself* a form of emotional abuse. The question isn't \"is the husband definitely not an abuser\" the question is \"on the surface the sil's behavior sounds appalling and maliciously hurtful, is there a reason it's not as appalling as it seems?\"", "There's a number of behaviors that are normally not OK that make sense in context of abuse, for instance it's normally not OK to put marital funds in a secret savings account, but it's understandable when someone's escaping abuse.
