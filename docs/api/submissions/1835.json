You hurt her when she needed your help the very most. \n\nYou really sat there and thought Hm whats the best way to help someone whos going into a position where they might have power and might not be ready? actively try to sabatoge and destroy their position? yea great idea asshat\\s", "YTA\n\nHow will she ever get herself out of her personal hell if all you will allow her to do is work at McDonalds.... if that's even OK for you.", "YTA\n\nYou sound malicious and jealous.

You may have destroyed your sister's opportunity to try and build her life back together. You may have very well exacerbated her addiction issue and made her fall back into the very thing that you despised so badly. Have you tried to help her instead of setting her back and shunning her so much? Even if the relationship might have destroyed because of her addiction and you wanted no involvement in her life, there was absolutely no need for you damage her career and her possible chance to get her started on building her life up. Whether she would benefit the company or not, that is the company decision, not yours! You have no rights to disclose private and personal matters regarding your sister to the company.\n\nIf you still think that what you did was the right thing.

Lots of people here with good explanations why that is the case. What stood out to me was that you put \"paying for rehab\" and \"paying for wedding\" on an equal level. Paying for something that could save someone's life is a much higher priority. I know I would do that for my child if it was ever needed and I would in fact go into debt to do that.

My mum even paid for her to go to rehab (even though she refused to help me pay for my wedding).\n\nShe has relapsed many times and it is highly likely that she will again. She has also stolen from me and my husband in the past to fund her habit.\n\nMy concern is that someone of her character should not be in a position of power over people and particularly those in vulnerable situations.\n\nOn Monday I sent an email to the company to just let them know what kind of person they are dealing with. I think it's important for them to know the full story before she starts her job so they can make an informed decision.\n\nAn hour ago, she called me and screamed down the phone saying that I was trying to destroy her life. She said I just didn't like the thought of her earning more than me even though I have a degree.\n\nI explained my reasons and that I only told them so that they could decide if she was a good fit for the company.\n\nShe didn't even lose the job over it.\n\nNow she and my mum are mad at me for trying to do the right thing.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
