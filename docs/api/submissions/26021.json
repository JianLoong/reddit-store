{"id": 26021, "submission_id": "167f1jx", "title": "AITA for taking back a shawl my wife made for a bride-to-be after she was uninvited from the wedding?", "selftext": "My wife, Lena, crochets a lot and often gifts it to friends and family. When her 2nd oldest brother got married, she made the bride a shawl to wear over her dress in the evening. The bride loved it and ever since Lena has made shawls for everyone in her family getting married.\n\nNow Lena\u2019s oldest brother, George, is getting married again. Lena doesn\u2019t have a relationship with George as he was abusive to her as a child, but if she has to see him then she is polite but distant with him. She doesn\u2019t want to cut off the rest of her family because of George. I work with George and while we aren\u2019t friends, we are friendly at work \u2013 Lena encouraged this, when George got moved to my team I was going to request a transfer not wanting to expose Lena to George as my team do a lot of get togethers with our significant others. As it is a family wedding, Lena\u2019s mom asked her if she could crochet a shawl for George\u2019s fiancee and Lena agreed. It was arranged that once it was finished I would take it to work to give to George so that Lena didn\u2019t have to see him.\n\nEarlier this week, the shawl was completed and I emailed George at work to let him know that I would bring it in today as the wedding is tomorrow. When I got into work this morning, I gave George the shawl and let him know that Lena and I were looking forward to the wedding. Come lunch time, Lena called me to let me know that George\u2019s fiancee had called her and told her that she was no longer invited to the wedding citing the place they are having the wedding and the reception at is too small for the number they have coming so are having to make cut backs. However I was still invited to the wedding. I was mad at this because they clearly only invited Lena to get a shawl, which to me is just rude. If they had asked Lena outright to make one, she probably would have done because she loves to crochet.\n\nOn my way out of work, I noticed George wasn\u2019t at his desk but the shawl was. I was still mad that they had used Lena to get a shawl and I just shoved it in my work bag. I left a note on his desk telling George since Lena was no longer invited, the shawl and I would no longer be attending either. On my way home, I told Lena what I had done and asked her if she wanted to go out instead, so not to waste having a sitter. Lena was upset that I had taken the shawl as it was causing an uproar in her family group chat where people were calling her petty because I took it back.\n\nLena wants me to give it back. I don\u2019t think I should, they don\u2019t deserve Lena\u2019s kindness. However, at the same time, I don\u2019t want Lena to be upset with me over George and a shawl.\n\nAm I the asshole for taking back the shawl?\n\nEdit: I have messaged the group chat, letting them know that I took it and if they should be pissed at anyone then it should be me but I would also do it again because no one gets to be a dick to Lena.", "created_utc": 1693593143, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167f1jx/aita_for_taking_back_a_shawl_my_wife_made_for_a/", "score": 5082, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was extremely rude to uninvite your wife but still \u201callow\u201d you to come.  No point giving the shawl back now. What\u2019s done is done.", "Nta\n\nYour wife needs to learn how to have a backbone. She's being used for her UNPAID skills and mistreated at the same time.", "NTA -actually you are the rock star for standing up to this childish behavior by George and his fianc\u00e9 on behalf of your wife.  The day before the wedding and they do a headcount for a wedding????  No way!!!  I bet if you had told them that you'd bring the shawl to the wedding, they would not have uninvited Lena.  (There is a slight touch of AH doing this without your wife's permission, but again in my opinion that's what made you the rock star.", "It seems I'm going against the grain here, but NTA. You're standing up for your wife, even if she can't stand up for herself because of years of treatment like this from her brother and family. You are absolutely correct about why they invited and then uninvited her.\n\nA handmade gift like crochet, knitting, or sewing is an act of great love, not to mention years of skill. They were willing to steal that love and skill, and demean everything your wife put into that shawl, and they did it in the cruelest way possible. Your wife was being far more magnanimous than they deserved in the first place, the least they could have done was suffer through her presence at their wedding in return (though I doubt it would be suffering for any decent human being to be in your wife's presence).\n\nI would go one step further and redirect all the ire she is getting from her family onto yourself. Tell them you did it without telling her, and you can even say you tossed the shawl so they can't just demand it back. Right now she's the only one bearing the brunt of their anger - it's your job to continue to stand up for her by redirecting their fury onto yourself and off your wife. Keep protecting her.", "NTA  Your wife is a people pleaser.  Your BIL did this to steal a shawl. Getting something through false pretense is stealing.  From someone who was dismissed and used by my family, I applaud you for defending your wife.", "You did the right thing, her family sounds horrible. Keep the damn thing and convince her she owes them nothing\u2026 why aren\u2019t they upset about him uninviting his own sister to his wedding? If she insists on you giving it back, just tell her you lost it or whatever, and she shouldn\u2019t let others walk all over her. She\u2019s placating them while they mistreat her.", "NTA for standing up for your wife, but it really should have been her call. I can\u2019t understand why she would have made them one in the first place if the relationship is that bad. Does she have self esteem issues?", "NTA. Crocheters seem to be the most marginalized group on this sub.", "NTA... This story is reminiscent of an Emily Dickinson novel imho. You did right by your wife not allowing her to be manipulated, and you handled it beautifully... As someone who crochets, I know it takes *hours and hours* of hard work and love put into each project. It's super rude of them to expect a gift like that without including her in attendance.", "NTA. While technically you would be TA to fight your spouses battles for them without consulting them; this is such a bad move from your spouse's family, they deserve it. I don't see why your wife doesn't see that. But no, it was a spur of the moment decision and it was done with the right intention and with the assumption that that's what your wife would want. So definitely NTA. Your wife should stand by your side on this one.\nEditing to say that this kind of move from your BIL means he would still be abusive to your wife if given the opportunity.", "If someone was going to be uninvited, surely it should have been OP. He is only the BIL, while Lena is George's sister. The timing made it crystal clear the george and the fianc\u00e9e were only waiting for the shawl before they uninvited your wife. Tell your wife not to be a doormat.\n\nNTA", "Lol. No.", "Is it too late to get George moved off your team?  I have a feeling this may cause work problems for you... especially if he invited the others that you work with.  Has your wife considered therapy for her family issues?  It sounds like she has spent her entire life brushing everything under the rug.", "NTA!", "I love you stood up for your wife. NTA for sticking up for her \n\nBet it\u2019s not the first time the family have used her kindness \n\nHave a chat with her about the shawl and go with what she wants", "Nta but take the heat off her and let it be known she was uninvited and you made the decision to take it back. Its not just George who was abusive, the whole family are.", "OMG, OP! I LOVE this move for you. \n\nMay make things a bit hard at work, but i reckon worth it. Even if the shawl is given back, id do it AFTER the wedding. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: I would double down on the petty and say that you wont attend because your wife should be there with you & it would be uncomfortable to attend as a coworker.", "No!!!  NTA...  \n\nYou defended your wife like you should...", "NTA.\nNot all superheroes wear capes.. some steal shawls..\nSome awards for you\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47", "NTA\n\nWhat a horrible family your wife has, that can see her brother be abusive to her as a child, see that they aren\u2019t close for a long time, then watch him invite to his wedding her then disinvite her after she gives him a gift, and have their takeaway be that she is being petty.", "NTA. Awfully rude to disinvite your wife and expect to get the shawl. Don't give the shawl back.", "NTA\n\nI applaud you for defending your wife, even when she doesn\u2019t. \n\nAnd what the hell, uninviting a sibling and not a coworker? What a horrible family, you are all probably better away from them.", "What the actual F is the family thinking calling Lena out for this, but not taking George to task for his behavior, manipulation, and greed?\n\nLena may need to discuss this with a therapist, because she deserves better than what her family will give. Hard boundaries are needed here.\n\nYou're NTA, and you're a good husband.", "NTA - But tell your that if she wants them to have the shawl she\u2019ll have to give it back to them herself. Tell George that you\u2019ll be blocking him and all of his family and won\u2019t be attending any more events until they apologize to your wife.", "NTA. I would personally contact every single person bugging your wife and explain to them that what you did was 100% your choice because of what her brother and the fsil did, that your wife didn\u2019t know anything about it and that you will continue to defend her the way you see fit if they continue to harass her.", "NTA \n\nYou stood up for your wife when her family didn't, Lena maybe a pushover but now her family would know that you will not let her get taken advantage of", "NTA: that bride sounds very\u2026 cold.", " NTA you\u2019re a great husband. Tell Lena to remove herself from the group chat. Protect her as much as you can, but tell Lena to step up and be firm. She\u2019s letting people step all over her!", "As a knitter and sometimes crocheter, I am pissed on your wife's behalf.  NTA, I woukd totally be petty.", "NTA, though you might want to give Lena some protection by sending out an email/text blast to the family letting them know this was your song and your decision as you could not tolerate how hurtful and insulting it was for your wife's invitation to be withrdrawn the day before the wedding. Suggest they direct their outrage towards the one who decided to insult Lena so grotesquely, or at least towards you for standing up for her.", "NAH between him and Lena. Obviously George, the fianc\u00e9 (does she know how badly he treated Lena) and the rest of the family are huge jerks. I understand the people saying to let Lena make her own choices, but in this case the husband is firmly an actor here. He has to work with the guy, he had to do a shawl handover and they have the audacity to keep him invited while blocking his wife. It\u2019s time to rock the boat.", "You did the right thing and your wife should be proud you have her back.", "NTA and maybe it would make your wife feel better to donate it to a women's shelter or something. I'm sure it's beautiful and someone out there would love to have it.\n\nAnd WHY would you - the brother-in-law - still be invited, but not his own sister? His wife sounds just as horrible as he is. The rest of the family can piss off.", "NTA", "NTA. Lena sounds like an angel and you did good protecting her and asking her out instead and making the most of the situation. It is a little petty taking the shawl back but when I read it I laughed in my head because it just played out so Comically in my mind. I understand why you did that and I think I might have done the same. It was a total justified move. JAM is it?", "NTA well done in fact for standing up for her.", "WTF You are invited to the wedding, but your wife isn't? I hate George. NTA", "NTA. If Lena still wants to send it, of course let her. I\u2019d go full NC with George and his floozy fianc\u00e9 hereafter.  Never TA for defending your wife.", "NTA, defend your wife of her abusive family.", "Wow, thanks for having the backbone that Lena needs.\n\nNTA", "NTA, give the shawl back after the wedding, everyone is happy. And add a card that asks them to think of your wife everytime they wear the shawl or hand it back at work with a comment of since we were uninvited to the wedding, I thought I'd bring it here.", "You are NTA for taking the shawl back but at the end of the day it's Lena's shawl to do what she wants.  If she wants it to go back to her ungrateful brother and his future wife, she should be allowed to do that.  I hope she doesn't though because the \"pettiness\" is uninviting someone right after you get the shawl and the rest of the family should fuck off.", "NTA\n\nAnd Lena needs to learn that her feelings matter", "NTA. You were sticking up for your wife. But, ultimately, I think you should let her do as she sees fit. I don't think she should give the shawl just to appease her family, but if she truly wants the fiancee to have it, I'd let her give it to her. \n\nPersonally, I hope she doesn't give her the shawl lol.", "NTA. Wow, the entitled audacity and disrespect from them is ugly. \n\nYou\u2019re an amazing husband, the support you\u2019ve shown your wife deserves praise. That said, ultimately it may be better to listen to what she wants, follow her lead, and be there for her in whatever ways she communicates. If you\u2019re concerned she\u2019s being a doormat (it sounds like she\u2019s afraid to rock the boat and tends to be the scapegoat for her brother\u2019s behavior), talk it through with her.", "NTA. But petty me would unravel the project and leave it on his desk.", "It's great that you are defending your wife but is this the right fight? You need to explain to your wife that it's not ok how her family is treating her, particularly given the history with George.\n\nIf she doesn't agree with you, then you are really on your own on this fight, if you are fighting for your wife and she doesn't want that then it's going to be a really difficult situation for you.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't want to fall out with my wife for defending her when she is explicit that she cares more about having a relationship with her family than her pride.", "NTA\n\nI'd burn the shawl before I return it.", "I understand your intent here but I think that at the point you're doing things to defend your wife that are making her life harder you've got to back down, it's her brother, her crafting, and her relationship to her family, so it's her decision at this point. So yeah, I'd say YTA if you keep going against the course she wants to take here, although that (probably) means being The Bad Guy for her when giving the shawl back.", "Gentle YTA\u2026 next time just check with Lena. \n\nI get that you did this from a place of love and wanting fairness for your wife. But you bypassed her option to have any say on the situation. \n\nAs someone who is not super fond of confrontation and who knits/crochets, when I finish a project for someone else, I want it gone. Sometimes the gifted item is a litmus test. Sometimes it\u2019s a farewell. Sometimes you knit all of your feelings about someone into it and when you bind off that last stitch or weave in your ends, you are done with them and letting their history cause you grief. Instead, your action has caused more conflict and headache for her.", "ESH except Lena. \n\nThem for inviting her then uninviting her. You for stealing the shawl without Lena\u2019s express permission. Lena\u2019s mother for asking her to make the shawl for a brother she hates.\n\nEdit: and her other family for being upset at her and not you.", "Soft YTA\n\nYour wife made the shawl, not you.  It was her issue to fix, not yours.  And she would like for George's fiancee to have the shawl despite how despicable she and George are.  Honor that wish.\n\nYou shouldn't go to the wedding and you should now request that work transfer.\n\nYou are also free to set your own boundaries with Lena's family and encourage her to do the same.", "Soft YTA.\n\nIt was your wife that made the shawl and it was her decision whether to give it or not. It was also her family and un-invitation that were involved in the affair.\n\nYou should have checked with your fife first.", "Very soft YTA. It wasn't your problem to solve or your gift to withdraw, but my petty ass is right behind you as I would totally have done this too", "YTA,\n\nYou had no buisness \"solving the problem\" for your wife. You reacted in a way that was kinda embarrassing to her, and you should give it back as your wife requested. Your wife is a grown woman who can solve problems for herself.", "YTA. It should be your wife's choice, and you need to tell your family to stop calling her petty because you took the shawl.", "YTA\n\nI get that you think you were being your wife's protector and standing up for her, but it's pretty ironic that you were \"protecting\" your wife from her former abuser by taking away her agency, making decisions on her behalf (and as it turns out, not even decisions that she agreed with), and basically infantilising her and imposing your will on her . . . all things that controlling, abusive men do to the women in their lives. \n\nEven in your comments you defend your behaviour by suggesting that you couldn't leave it to Lena to deal with this herself, because \"when it comes to George she prefers to just bury her head in the sand\" . . . as if she doesn't have the right to make that choice, but must choose YOUR way of doing things, or else it's not \"the right way\" of dealing with the situation.\n\nUltimately, I'm not sure that I see how you're much better than George if you both leave Lena feeling unseen, unheard, and like neither of you has much respect for her agency in her own life.\n\nJust something to think about.", "Cant be anything other than ESH,  once you hand over a gift, its not yours anymore.\n\nYou stole from him and your wife said to give it back, you are ignoring her wishes.\n\nBut they also suck for waiting till after a gift is exchanged to choose to uninvite\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReddit is a weird place today, all these comments saying IGNORING YOUR WIFES WISHES is a good thing, absolutely insane", "YTA for taking the shawl not consulting your wife. Your wife has to deal with the fall out from your rash decision.", "She should not make anyone a shawl in the family. Her family supports such terrible treatment of her. \n\nYou keep the shawl and go NO CONTACT with any of them. This entire thing is rude and vindictive towards your wife. The entire family clearly do not respect her to allow such a thing.", "NTA, you stood up for your wife. However, I think if she is the one getting harassed for it and is asking you to return it, you might need to respect her request. Unless you are able to start intercepting the harassment.", "NTA but you should go to the wedding and wear the shawl", "NTA.  They used your wife, and it\u2019s great you stood up for her.", "NTA. as long as you make it crystal clear that it was entirely your idea and your wife didn't even know till you got home. Tell them that if they would like the shawl they should invite lena and you guys can bring it for when you both arrive.", "NTA I\u2019d taken it back too. And I would have  my wife add me to the group chat and set the record right. That she had nothing to do with me taking the Shaw back. I took it and it will not be returned since my wife was used and then discarded after she was of no more use to the lovely bride and groom. That they had the fricking gall to disinvite her the minute it was in their possession and to still think that I\u2019d attend is mind blowing. Sorry but I\u2019m mad for your wife along with you. Edit I\u2019d ask for that transfer now. I just couldn\u2019t ever be polite to him again.", "NTA at all. You are amazing.", "NTA.  You are spot on that they used your wife for the shawl.

I'm glad you took it,  George and his bride are just awful people.", "Exactly", "Eww that's sexist, she doesn't need you solving her problems for you", ">Does she have self esteem issues?\n\nShe does. One of the things George did was make her think she was not worthy of being loved or capable of doing anything of worth.", "I'm sure she knows. She's just been functioning in this toxic family system forever and is used to ignoring things to keep the peace.", "Unfortunately not, he's been part of the team for a year.

That's not sexist, that's the truth of the situation.", "Her whole family are AHs! No wonder this poor soul has no self esteem. They are ok with George uninviting his own sister for no reason ? And have the audacity to still expect her beautiful handmade gift????  You are an awesome husband for taking it back. I'd put in that transfer to a different team or better yet ask that George transfer. You should tell all your work friends how awful George is.  You said that you and your wife have socialized with your teammates a lot. They have to have some loyalty to you and her?", "NTA\n\nGeorge sounds awful, why does the family side with him?  Don't they know about his abuse? \n\nWhat does the family say about them uninviting your wife the day before the wedding.

They don't deserve the shawl. And Lena might well be capitulating to 'keep the peace'. We do also have sympathy for your feelings about this, as it's hard to watch a spouse being mistreated. But despite all that, you're still 'an asshole', for the purpose of this sub-reddit (and so are Lena's family, for obvious reasons). \n\nIn your case though - even if Lena is making decisions you think are unwise, it's still her RIGHT to make them. You don't have the right to take the power off another adult like that, regardless of her decisions (especially when you create consequences for her, as is now the case in her family).\n\nIf she prefers to bury her head in the sand with George, then that's where she's at psychologically with him- and it's ultimately HER choice. You'll seriously damage your relationship, overruling her in this way, like you're in charge of her. She isn't your child. All you can do is encourage her to stand up for herself more.\n\nIn addition, it isn't even your shawl to make any decisions about. You've effectively stolen it. Its owner is currently George's fiancee, who it was gifted to. And indeed, its original owner (Lena), who gifted it, still wants it to belong to George's fiance. \n\nUnfortunately, you do need to give it back, if that's Lena's wish. There's other ways to express your anger. For example, you'd be better to just write them a long message, telling them how objectionable and unpleasant their behaviour is. \n\nAnd if you're not going to return the shawl quickly (even though you should), at least set it straight with them, that it was YOUR unilateral choice to take it- and nothing to do with Lena. At least take the heat off her, and 100% onto yourself instead. This was YOUR choice.", "Eww no that's not a partnership, that's you infantilizing your wife.", "Oh please. He does not have to give back the shawl regardless. George disrespecting his wife is a disrespect to OP. You talk a lot of nonsense", "Please say /s\nA partnership is having each other's back.

You were right to take the shawl back.", "NTA, those people suck. \n\nAlso, though it may not be true, I recommend your wife send something like this: \n\n\"One of the reasons I make shawls for family weddings is the joy I get seeing the bride wear it. Knowing that 40+ hours of my life went into creating something for that specific moment and how happy and beautiful the bride is. I have never charged anyone for this reason, seeing that joy has always been payment enough. I was under the impression that would come to pass this time, as I was invited. As SOON as the fruits of my labour were in hand, I was cut. That's devastating. You didn't want ME as a part of your day, just my labour and my talent. I'm hurt you don't me as a full person, and I'm hurt that everyone else seems to think it's okay to use me like that. At this point, it's making me question if ANY of you see me as more than free labor. I'm crushed to know how unwelcome in this family I truly am\"  \n\n\nGuilt trip the fuck out of those assholes.

I would want it back to keep or gift to someone else I actually like.\n\n\nAnd while I'd be like op and would 1000% take it back after being uninvited, I don't think it's fair to strip the wife of agency in this situation.
