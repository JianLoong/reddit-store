When my boyfriend and I went to Mexico, I spoke to the servers at the hotel and restaurant because he didn\u2019t know Spanish. Did she not call because she wanted you to starve lol? Wasn\u2019t she going to eat too?", "NTA - heck, I can barely understand the takeaway operator over the phone in my own country, it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask your wife to do this in her language, in her country which you located to for her job.\n\nGood luck with learning the language.", "NTA.  All the Y.t.a. votes make absolutely no sense.", "I'm surprised you're getting YTA.\n\nYou moved to *her* country for her employment. Cool. It's a recent event so it's totally understandable you haven't had enough time to learn the language. 'Practicing' your limited language skills over the phone to a busy takeaway employee isn't really the right time or place - it's hard enough understanding people who speak the same language as you over the phone with background noise.\n\nWhen someone moves to your country and they don't speak the language, it's implied you're going to have to help them out with these things. It's absurd to me that people think otherwise. I can understand if you'd been there for years and weren't making an effort to learn...but it's not the case here.\n\nAs for being on the phone all day... hell, I was a call centre operator taking 200 calls per day and wouldn't think twice about placing a takeaway order. Big deal.", "Edit: removed. I read/misunderstood some parts", "NTA our society is going to suffer because of things like door dash and Uber eats making it so that people never have to interact with anyone (not the fault of the drivers at all, just this weird isolated environment we\u2019re moving toward). \n\nIt should not be hard to place a phone call for this. I think people are talking themselves into being more isolated than they need to be, hyping up feelings of social anxiety, canceling plans last minute to be antisocial. They are making a lack of communication the norm and I think it\u2019s to their individual detriment and to the detriment of society as a whole. We have to be able to engage with other people as a baseline. This is absurd.", "NTA - You don\u2019t speak the language and she does.", "NTA, I do think the childish comment was a little over the line.

It's an odd think to which I honestly don't really understand the difference aside from, being at work it pays my bills.\n\nI think a lot of the ah comments are coming from people who lack awareness regarding other countries. They think because something is all around them it must be like that for everyone in every other country. Like suggesting ordering online, I think if that was an option you'd have done it yourself, or at the very least you wife wouldve suggested that as an alternative.", "So you moved to a country for her and she can't even be bothered to help order food for both of you while you order?\n\nYou aren't an AH for expecting that since she is (at least physically) an adult \n\nNTA", "Most people don't love calling in a food order, but it's a simple chore which we need to do anyway. Refusing to do something simple for her and making you do it when you don't speak the language yet was a selfish act, and children are usually selfish.

She no doubt doesn\u2019t like to talk on the phone, but what she really does not want to do is help you find your way in a country you don\u2019t speak the language in any longer. Kids of immigrants feel this way all the time, but can\u2019t really say no. Your wife can and she is. But if you\u2019ve just moved recently she should help you out for much longer.

My reasons being that you don't know the language well yet and so it makes sense that you wouldn't want to call and frustrate busy employees. That being said, I also completely understand the phone anxiety from your wife because I also hate to talk on the phone unless it's an absolute necessity. I don't think either of you is ta, even though you didn't need to call her childish for it. Maybe you guys could go grocery shopping together to cook at home, and getting to pick out foods could be a fun way for you to learn more about the language?", "Nta for the fact you dont know the language and didnt want to call but yta for calling her childish. Shes probably got phone anxiety, i know i say the exact same thing.", "YTA my friend.\n\nShe is not obligated to call the takeaway for you, especially when she uses the phone for her job often.", "YTA- this is a great opportunity for you to immerse yourself in the new language. Either google the menu and work through it to tell them what you want over the phone or go to the restaurant and point at items in person. She\u2019s not going to be there to help you all the time, maybe you\u2019ve been using her as a crutch too much and she\u2019s tired of it", "Phone anxiety is a thing dude. YTA and while I don't know if it's an option where you live try see if there is an app you can use for  takeaway/takeout.", "I hate making phone calls. I rarely answer my phone even if it is a friend because I just don't like it. At all. Don't know if it is part of the ADHD thing or something else. Your wife probably has to force herself to handle phone calls at work, and it stresses her out. It seems like this tiny thing to you, like a leisurely stroll through a park. To her, it's Mt Everest. Are you able to order at the restaurant, or is the language barrier still a hindrance? Are there any apps for ordering there? In an ideal world, of course your wife would pick up the phone and make the order. In the meantime, use this as an incentive to learn the language. Maybe focus on the vocabulary you need to order successfully.", "I'm gonna go now with ESH than anything else. \n\n1) you're married to someone who you've refused to learn their language even basic conversational so thereby causing a wall between yourself and your wife even before she got the job there. You didn't marry her out of the blue with no knowledge and obviously didn't attempt to learn even the basics while dating.\n\n2) she knows you don't speak the language and refused to order the takeout\n\nShe might be tired of picking up your shortfalls because it seems like you're refusing/not wanting to learn the language to do basic communication. I've seen this in the military where they move overseas to different bases, the spouse expecting special treatment expecting people to cater because they refuse to speak anything but American while the soldier has learned the language of their command country.", "YTA\n\nBecause the solution to your problem is absolutely trivial. Don't order via phone, use the Internet/Apps instead. Any delivery website I've ever encountered in my non-english speaking country offers the option to switch the language to english.

Especially not one of foreign extraction!\"\n\nVery rude, but your wife simply has to make a few more calls and become comfortable with the telephone again.", "My question OP is are you always doing things for your wife and she does the bare minimum for you", "Because she apparently has a situational telephone anxiety disorder.  It's not supposed to make sense, that is why it's called a disorder.  She can make and take work calls despite her anxiety because she HAS to, and they are for her work, not for her own personal needs, so her body's physiological reaction to them is muted.  When she has to make calls for something related to her own personal needs, her body's reaction is stronger and she can't overcome that anxiety hurdle, because it is so much taller.    \n\n\nFolks without anxiety, you should be happy your body doesn't react like you almost hit a deer if someone taps you on the shoulder, and not pick on anxiety sufferers because theirs does, as medications and cognitive behavioral and exposure therapy do not work for everyone.", "So ask the person on the phone to talk slower or explain you don\u2019t speak the language well.

The you in \"you can use for takeaway/takeout\" was a plural you.", "You understand there are settings to change the language on your phone and on apps, right?  All he has to do is know how to look up the place, as most have online ordering features now, and select what they want to order.", "There are different times when phone anxiety can occur. I have no problem talking to my family over the phone, but if I have to order something I need to take like 15 minutes to get myself to do it.

And that alone is so stressful and exhausting and mentally taxing that by the time we get home at the end of the day or on our off days, we\u2019re so tapped out that we can\u2019t handle it.
