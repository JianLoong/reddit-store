You're not an asshole either way and you would be well within your rights to sue your sister for damages if her kids broke them by accident, but if she purposely smashed them, this could be a relationship-extinction-level event.

You did her and her family a favor (as a good sister probably should). She was disrespectful and I\u2019d move ahead and sue her. If your elderly parents want to stick their noses in this mess then tell them they can take in your sister if they feel so strongly. Don\u2019t second guess yourself at all.

Did your pets get hurt because of all that smashed glass as you said \u201cmy enclosures had been smashed and my pets with them\u201d?

Did she kill your pets?", "NTA.\n\nShe fucked around and found out.\n\nShe should have been respectful of your choice to keep your pets, and simply told the kids to stay TF out of your room.  \n\nWhat's that old saying?  Don't bite the hand that feeds you?  Well it's the same for the person who houses you when they have no obligation to.  Don't bite that hand either.  And don't purposely destroy their stuff when the easier option is to teach your kids that there are rooms they aren't allowed to enter.\n\nAnd tell your parents that you aren't \"choosing your pets\" over your family.  Your sister chose to disrespect you over respecting you, point blank period which means she can no longer live with you.  It was a choice she made as an adult, so she can suffer the consequences like an adult.\n\nEnclosures cost money.  The pets cost money.  The food and accessories cost money. And she destroyed it without a care in the world for respect for you.  She seems to have forgotten who the homeowner was and whose room it was. And it's not your problem that she's no longer welcome, only hers.\n\nAnd maybe ask your parents why YOU know that kind of behavior is inappropriate in someone else's home but she doesn't.  Her entitled attitude landed her in the situation she's in, and you no longer want someone who disrespects you to that level to be in your home.  PERIOD.\n\nOh and I say this as a person who got the creepy crawlies when you were describing your pets.

Its okay to kill anything you don't like, actually mom will do it for you. \n\nNot only are you NTA, you should most definitely sue her because obviously she is unaware of consequences for her actions.  Perhaps being sued will at least show her children that its not okay to act that way.  \n\nIf they are in your house, then they are already imposing, for anyone to be so entitled as to think you should get rid of your pets that are IN  YOUR ROOM is incredible.  They shouldn't be in your room in the first place (the sister and her kids).  \n\nI think bugs are cool, I don't really want a pet tarantula but I have a mealworm colony on my kitchen counter (the mice and fish think they are the most delicious things ever to have existed). I get that it could make someone uncomfortable but there are all sorts of things in life that can make someone uncomfortable and with bugs I've found the more you learn about them the less creepy they are.  \n\nThose poor kids are being taught that ignorance is a badge of honor and that their comfort is of the utmost importance and they are entitled to the rest of the world conforming to their whims.  \n\nSue her.

If it was an accident where one of the kids was trying to look at them and accidentally broke it, then maybe don't kick them out.

I get it but they were enclosed in your room which no one had a right to trespass in and certainly not to sneak in and cause damage. Your sister is out of line. She needs to reimburse you. Since your folks seem to think it's fine the  she can move in with them! Or they can pay her rent elsewhere. Or since she moved due to flood damage she can put in an insurance claim for housing elsewhere.

No matter what type of animal! Like if someone did that to my dog you bet I'd sue! You do what you gotta do. She chose to act out like a child and so she needs consequences.

Losing one's temper when their pets have been MURDERED isn't ok? When is it ok to lose one's temper?\n\nNTA, OP. You're justified in kicking her out.", "Reanimation isn't do-able. So there is no recovery here.", "They killed all her bugs, nothing is recoverable. I hope you\u2019re joking with this vote.", "Even if they had nowhere to go, they could\u2019ve left that door closed and not have to worry about the animals.", "I Forgot to say but NTA at all", "She smashed them on purpose. My enclosures and my pets. It was very obvious it was on purpose and she admitted it to me", "What about the level the sister took it to by killing OP's pets **on purpose**?", "This is correct, those setups are pricey and she killed your pets. Never allow her in your home again after getting the money she owes you.\n\nNTA", "My enclosures alone were well over a grand for the set up and husbandry, not to mention the costs of my pets themselves", "Ditto. Not a fan of insects like op has. But they're in tanks they cannot escape from otherwise they would have by now.", "Killed with malicious intent? That better? \n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder\n\nInform yourself?", "Wow, that's awful.  Definitely NTA.  Your sister committed an egregious act of disrespect against someone who was hosting her family in their time of need.  She violated ancient laws of hospitality in a truly brazen manner; basically every culture we know of would have condemned destroying your host's property like this.  I'm angry on your behalf, and so are all your ancestors.\n\nSo yeah, ask her for a check to replace everything, to the extent that living beings can be replaced, and then take her to court if she refuses if your lawyer thinks it's worth it.  In either case, never let her into your house again, and I would understand if you wanted to cut her entirely out of your life.  The only way this could have been worse would have been if she'd assaulted you directly.", "I am very much not a fan of any of these pets but they were OP\u2019s pets. If someone hurt my cat on purpose I\u2019d probably beat them to a pulp, relative or not. Getting evicted and sued is nothing. I would definitely also see if you can press charges for destruction of property. This is not an innocent mistake. It\u2019s sick and shows absolutely no regard for OP.", "Pets were killed. She said they were smashed.", "\"I went to look and my enclosures had been smashed and my pets with them.\"\n\nThe pets in question, being insects, were also smashed", "It says the pets where smashed along with the container....so yes she killed them.", "All of my pets were smashed and killed in their enclosures.", "Single digit age children are going to break things. Suing for property damage when you failed to secure fragile property in the presence of children is unreasonable.", "There were so many other non violent options for her and instead she chose to destroy expensive habitats and the lives of your pets inside of them. Not to mention making a huge mess in your bedroom. It could have been a learning opportunity for her kids, but she started smashing things instead. NTA and keep them out of your house, don't doubt yourself. This kind of behavior isn't sane or healthy. Ask for monetary compensation, and if she refuses then go with the courts or police. Make sure everything is documented.", "I would absolutely sue. You can\u2019t just destroy property and kill pets. There are consequences. Stick with your guns, kick \u2018em out, and get back the money she owes for her actions.", "This is so horrifying she could do this. Honestly I\u2019d have trouble speaking to her ever again. Definitely ick her out and sue", "The sister killed her pets, not the children", "My 36 year old sister killed them. Not her children.", "If that's the case, then sure - sister is psycho.", "NTA then. Sister be crazy."]}
