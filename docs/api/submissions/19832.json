I grew up with them and have known them for a long timex and \n\nWe also needed assistance on bills since we used all our savings on the property. we all agreed to 400 a room as long as I could keep my office and living room furniture downstairs considering they only pay for their rooms, and the bathroom. There\u2019s no written contract.\n\nA few weeks later they moved in, but also brought a dog that I didn\u2019t know of. I didn\u2019t mind because the dog is a realllllyyyyy good boy. Now almost a year has passed and his girlfriend also stays almost every night, uses everything everyone else does. She\u2019s not an issue at all besides the issue of her basically living here. He needs her to give him rides to work until he can pay to get his license back next week. His little brother is months late on rent, and the downstairs stinks like dogs and is covered in hair and just not as cleanly as normal pet owners usually are. \n\nI talked to his little brother about his rent and I told him he has until the end of the month to come up with the money, or get an offer letter from ANYONE or he\u2019s going to have to start looking for somewhere to live. It\u2019s been months and he\u2019s only given me 100 bucks but has somehow has money for weed and alcohol. \n\nThe older brother wants me to take it easy on his little brother since he needs help with rides to work due to a DUI and his phone is off so it\u2019s hard to get calls back from jobs. He also said he understands that I have to do what I need to do. We can\u2019t afford to keep watching his little brother play call of duty all day and night while pounding drinks in his room. \n\nI\u2019m at a crossroads.

They'll never know how good they have it unless you kick them to the curb.", "Yeah if the brother was at least respectful and trying, would be different imo", "My wife said she was just ranting and doesn\u2019t actually bother them in any way. If I was focused on the girlfriend I wouldn\u2019t of made a longer rant about his brother.", "He can have his brother or his gf, but what about the dog? I hear the dog is a reeaallly good boy, so he needs a house. My dog has never paid rent either. Freeloader. \n\nAlso, NTA.", "We live in the middle of nowhere.", "Was going to suggest the same!!", "And when hes asks for the new password tell him it's\n\nPAYYOURRENT", "Missed the part where any of that is OP's problem.", "Please Google it.", "It is entirely true. This is misinformation and dangerous.", "Not trying to be snarky, just genuinely curious:\n\nIs what you said not changing the password like the comment above said? Or are you suggesting adding another password?", "First comment is talking about changing the WiFi password. The comment responding is suggesting OP call the Internet provider and add a password or code so that the brother can't call and get around it.", "Ah, makes sense. I've only really heard of that setup for event planning with a sabotaging relative, not to keep out freeloaders", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" is taking advantage of the situation", "YTA if you don\u2019t prioritize your family here. Why are these people even around your children? You sound way too kind to them and not the people who matter. \n\nLet your buddy take it easy on them if he cares so much. The three of them and the dog can move right in with him.\n\nStart eviction ASAP because it is a long process and if you are waiting till it is even worse, it will be a nightmare before they\u2019re out. Good luck!!", "You say they aren\u2019t deadbeats. But the brother is the definition of a deadbeat\n- doesn\u2019t pay rent (on time if at all)\n- has money for weed and alcohol still rather than paying rent\n- doesn\u2019t have money for a phone to get job offers (how cheap is handset and sim?! Not a iPhone but a cheap mobile that you can make calls from?)\n- still has money for weed and beer rather than thinking maybe I could get a phone\n- plays call of duty all day (over getting a job to pay you rent)", "They pay half my mortgage, I\u2019ve prioritized my family this whole time.", "Very good point actually thank you", "He fell behind before and paid me back the moment he got his first check.", "He actually did for a while, and he got a job and paid us all back but then got laid off a few months later and it\u2019s happening again. He said he has an offer letter to sign Monday so we\u2019ll see.", "I haven\u2019t lost them, I spoke to them today. We\u2019re not having arguments or disagreements, just a lot of bad situations all around that are piling up and it\u2019s getting to be a lot.", "I don\u2019t care about anyone smoking, it\u2019s not around the kids or illegal here. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t want to see you smoking if you can\u2019t pay your rent", "Also they pay half my mortgage. I\u2019ve prioritized them the whole time by to saving money on our mortgage. Our bills are mostly covered.", "The buddy I\u2019m referring to is the older brother who also lives with us. They don\u2019t affect my family in anyway. My family is fine with them besides my wife and I being frustrated over bills we\u2019re covering. They\u2019re not monsters, just not paying bills that I think they should be.", "I smoke weed", "Fair enough, I thought you had said they\u2019re keep your children up and drinking and doing drugs in your house while not pay their bills\u2026 but if it\u2019s just venting you have my support. Only you know how bad it is. Half the mortgage is pretty significant too.", "Nah there\u2019s no written agreement or law like that here. They also wouldn\u2019t stay if I told them to leave, it\u2019s more id rather be payed back first before I just kick him out completely", "What? He is their landlord!\n\nHe has mouths to feed! Did you know that children have an addiction to eating regularity? I don\u2019t think you get it, the body is physically dependent on food to the point where they could literally die. Why aren\u2019t they being more considerate to his children\u2019s needs? \n\nYou do get that his family is struggling because of them", "\"Penny already eats our food she can pay for wifi- no spaces\"", "My wife said she want just ranting and if she was being honest they don\u2019t affect our kids at all. I edited to post and took that out.", "The stress still effects them. \n\nNot sure about their exposure to the drug/alcohol use, but not great to have that in the house either. \n\n**Who you live with effects your kids.** It\u2019s complete bullshit to say otherwise.", "NTA. They are having unfortunate things happen while you foot the bill.", "Yeah, fuck that.\n\nScrape 'em off...", "I don\u2019t know if this is the right answer but YTA because this isn\u2019t about the girlfriend. This is about overdue rent and uncleanliness. Are you charging them $400 per week each? That\u2019s a lot of money. \nYou have people drinking excessively and using drugs in your home where your children live. That isn\u2019t a good thing.", "Enabling little bro isn't helping him in the long run. Learning to budget rent is a critical life skill, understanding there are consequences if you don't is necessary.", "Yeah agreed. I would've been concerned the moment they showed up with a surprise dog.", "Do you want these people to be around your children, though?", "Rename the WiFi  that", "YTA to yourself and your wife and kids for putting up with these freeloading deadbeats", "OP already answered this: the house is \"in the middle of nowhere\".", "Yeah, you said.", "Yup u/BetrayedFate managed to explain that perfectly.", "No good deed goes unpunished.\n\nSorry for your troubles, but you gotta do what you gotta do.", "You have three tennants three and a half if you condider the dog, and only one of yhem is paying. How could it posdibly bd unfair of you to demand more or that they leave.\n\nNTA\n\nYou are being manipulated and takrn advantage of", "NTA, last thing you should do with someone suffering from addictions and struggles is to enable their behaviour. \nThey need to have a wave of realisation to turn around.", "So they\u2019ve already had a month\u2019s notice that they\u2019re falling short and you expect them to respect you and the house, and nothing has changed. \n\nYou need to have a hard conversation and get ready to lose the friendship. They don\u2019t respect you or your home in the slightest and they\u2019re taking you for granted, as if mom and dad are just taking care of everything so they don\u2019t need to make any effort. There\u2019s no way this won\u2019t cause resentment but you do need them out. They won\u2019t come to the realisation that they shit the bed on themselves until a few years later, if ever."]}
