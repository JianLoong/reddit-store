Just be sure to find out the appropriate tenancy laws in your area and begin the eviction process.", "NTA you are being used. Kick them out asap. For one, he won't come up with the money. And even if he does, he'll likely just repeat and not pay you again for a while. And for another, he's not keeping the place clean. And he's sitting around on his ass all day. And has money for other things. Lastly he's letting someone stay there that you didn't agree to. So yeah, you really need to kick them out now, or you'll get what you deserve. And remember - don't worry about being a \"bad friend\" because he sure isn't worried about being a bad friend to you which he totally is being. You've already been a great friend. He hasn't been to you and if he was a good friend, he'd be much better about wanting to be more helpful to you.
