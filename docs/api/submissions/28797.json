They were living with my parents to save money for a house. Ten years later they were still there, both employed but didn\u2019t save a dime and used my parents for free housing, food and childcare.\n\nIn 2018 we began to notice his fianc\u00e9 seemed off sometimes. Then she lost her job as a physician\u2019s assistant, actually she quit because they were going to drug test her. After that she couldn\u2019t hold down a job and let her nursing license expire. Eventually it got so bad that my parents had the police remove her from their house in 2021.  She was in possession of meth at the time and highly intoxicated. This forced my brother to get a place of their own so they could be together. \n\nThey were evicted from several places for not paying rent and after the third eviction she took off and abandoned her child and my brother.  According to docket sheets she gets public intoxication and disorderly conduct charges frequently in the next town over. \n\nMy brother\u2019s habit of stealing got worse. He pawned my dad\u2019s baseball card collections, stole their debit card numerous times, stole cash, and entered their home when they weren\u2019t there to loot for things to pawn.  My parents changed the locks, got a wall safe and have an order from police that he is not permitted on their property but that rarely stops him. \n\nHe has two DUI\u2019s, drug possession charges, theft charges, and nearly a dozen citations for driving while his license is suspended. He lost his job again and is living in his car. His child is living with the ex-fianc\u00e9s parents.\n\nHe vehemently denies being an addict.  He says he takes Percocet once in a while and it\u2019s no different than someone drinking a few glasses of wine to relax. He blames his situation either on the DUI and not having a reliable way to get to work or his own family. \n\nHe says hateful things to me when I don\u2019t give in to his pleas for money.  He believes I enjoy watching him suffer because I can afford to give him money but refuse. Before his addiction we had a good relationship and he has to know deep down that I am not someone who puts others down to boost my ego. \n\nI know I\u2019m supposed to love him and be supportive. I am not supposed to yell at him or tell him what he needs to do because he has to want it for himself.  It\u2019s just so hard because he has this victim mentality and no matter what happens it isn\u2019t his fault. Last week he wanted $20 to take his child to KFC. When I said no, he said it was good to know I was going to be the reason his child didn\u2019t get to see him that week. I know it\u2019s a manipulation tactic to get money. It always is some sob story. \n\nHow do I help someone who constantly tells me I\u2019m a terrible person and everything is my fault? This has ripped our family apart but I feel that ending contact with him is my only choice.", "created_utc": 1697130824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176c4as/aita_for_not_doing_more_to_help_my_drug_addict/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to hit rock bottom. Helping him enables him. You can't love an addict clean. They simply have to want to be clean. \n\nHe is the reason he doesn't see his kid, not the 20 bucks he doesn't have to go to KFC, which you know is likely a lie. \n\nCut him off, give him an ultimatum, and stand firm.", "NTA.\n\nSadly, this is a common pattern for people struggling with addiction. The victim mentality is strong, and they will try to blame all of their problems on just about anything they can.. except for themselves. (Been there, done that.)\n\nThe problem is, at the end of the day, there\u2019s only so much you can really do to help someone in this position. If your brother wants the help, he will get the help he needs, but that is a commitment he has to make and want on his own terms. You can\u2019t force that decision to be made in his head. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult watching someone you love go through addiction, and of course, it\u2019s natural for you to want to help your loved ones through their struggles. It can get to a point, however, where they will eventually take you down with them, be it emotionally, financially, mentally, spiritually, etc.\n\nYou can only do so much to help someone in this position. I think it\u2019s gotten to the point you need to step away, and if your brother (hopefully) smartens up and realizes what he\u2019s doing to himself, then he will take those next steps to recovery. Continuing this type of support will just continue to enable him.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s very important for you to protect your peace, so make the decision that you feel is necessary to do so.", "NTA  The $20 wasn't for KFC.  He will lie, use guilt and abuse to get what he wants which is more drugs.  You can't help him and every time you do it just prolongs his problem.", "Cut him out of your life. It sucks, but it\u2019s for the best. He won\u2019t get better til he *wants* to get better, which could be a long time from now, or he could never want to. This is toxic and seems to be causing you a lot of stress. I think it\u2019s best to cut him out of your life until he is showing signs of working on himself to get better.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  He\u2019s saying those hurtful things to manipulate you. That $20 wasn\u2019t going to KFC. So sorry that you have to go through this, is horrible to see a close family member struggling with addiction.", "NTA - Don't enable him, which will only hurt him.", "\"I feel that ending contact with him is my only choice\" Yes that most definitely is your only choice. Dont blame yourself.. none of this is your fault. He chose this life for himself. NTA", "NTA\n\nStop everything, he has to want to help himself.  Until that time comes, he will continue to take and take until there is nothing left to take, then he will find another way to take.    Your parents need to have him arrested, he may or may not clean up in jail, but it will stop him from stealing from them for a while.  \n\nMy ex-husband is an addict.  He is homeless, he tries to guilt us all into giving him money or shelter.  He will try to make it out that we are bad people.  His sisters helped him when I cut him off, they finally see why I cut him off.  They have too now.  I will not allow him to take my son to visit, he can come and visit my son in my yard, he can't come in my home.  \n\nYou have to cut him off.  He will not change until he wants to, which may be never, my ex-husband is 62.  He tries to lie to us saying he's going to rehab to get back on medication, not for getting clean, he refuses to admit he is using.  I'm sorry for the ramble, just protect yourself.", "Boundaries, set them and keep them.", "Addicts use victim mentality and guilt tripping to convince themselves and others that what they are doing is ok. It\u2019s simply the way that they have to lie to themselves and their enablers to keep feeding the addiction. It breaks families but you hav rto cut him off financially and however else he is enabled other than kindly but firmly reminding him that getting help/rehab is an option.\n\nNTA.", "As someone who's spent the majority of my life around addicts including my mother, you can only involve yourself to an extent. Unfortunately addiction pushes people to steal, lie, and do anything they can to pay for the next high especially when the withdrawal effects are so severe. The BEST thing you can do for him is get him involuntarily committed to a rehab if you can, and giving money to an addict is a VERY bad idea. If he needs food and you'd like to help him, offer to get him some groceries/take him to eat but don't give him cash. The hard truth is, no matter what you do, he will only continue to spiral until he recognizes and decides to fix the problem himself.", "NTA it\u2019s not your fault at all.  It\u2019s a terrible situation to see a loved one destroying their life,", "NTA.  Unfortunately there is nothing you can do to help him.  He has to want that for himself and until he does he will continue to do the same things over again.  I have lost several friends over the years due to drug abuse, and I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.  The only thing you can do is be there for him if and when he comes around sober.", "NTA. You need to protect your family and your assets. That car he's driving around in, in your name, doesn't protect you.\n\nNot to get too personal, but I lost my older sister to fentanyl last year. I cut her off in 2021 because she called me, the day BEFORE my birthday - thinking it was my birthday, to tell me more awful, terrible news about her life. I just couldn't take it anymore. That was the last time I spoke to her and I told her to get her shit together.\n\nDid I feel bad for not helping her more? Yeah, but it's not your burden. She was in and out of rehab and didn't care. They say you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. Same thing for people especially.\n\nUntil your brother stops being in denial about his life, you are of no help to him. You'll only subject yourself to more trauma. I say this with the utmost love & respect. <3", "He sounds pretty insufferable. NTA. Your mental health is as important as his and he\u2019s trying to drown you both instead of learning to swim. \n\n> He vehemently denies being an addict. He says he takes Percocet once in a while and it\u2019s no different than someone drinking a few glasses of wine to relax. He blames his situation either on the DUI and not having a reliable way to get to work or his own family.\n\nPeople who ***need*** (not simply enjoy) a few glasses of wine to relax are also addicts. Not to even get into the wild differences between the two on even a surface level. \n\nPeople who get DUIs are addicts. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an addict, I\u2019m simply behave like one.\u201d\n\n> Last week he wanted $20 to take his child to KFC. When I said no, he said it was good to know I was going to be the reason his child didn\u2019t get to see him this week.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know this but I want you to read it anyway: it\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s his fault he can\u2019t provide for his kid. Also no clue what a meal has to do with him seeing his kid. He can visit without taking him out to eat. Probably wasn\u2019t  even going to see the kid and was just going to pocket the $20. \n\nYou could meet him halfway and give him a gift card or order ahead for him on the app if you feel charitable in the future, but by no means should you ever feel obligated to.", "Former addict ... 6.5 years clean now. Cutting off is the best thing you can do. I lost my kids, my family, my job. Rehab didn't help. I had to change my surroundings to change my life... It's hard but the best you can do is just stop. He will figure it out eventually.", "It's not about asshole or not, it's about tolerance and boundaries. You don't have to love and support him, you choose to. Maybe because he's family, maybe something else.\n\nI'm not going to call you an asshole, I am going to be a bit blunt here though and call you what you likely are, unhealed.\n\nIt's okay, many people are. Your emotions are perfectly valid.\n\nI get it, I cut my own mother off while I was healing myself. She won't be allowed back in my life. The choice.\n\nSo, I'll simplify it, family doesn't mean you can abuse your loved ones, and right now, it sounds like he's abusing you.\n\nYou are not an asshole, I think you're just working through some stuff, as your brother is, as most are.", "Addiction is a evil disease there's nothing you can do until he has had enough sorry you're going through this you are doing the right thing by not giving him money", "People always say \u201cthey have to hit rock bottom\u201d or some dumbass thing. It\u2019s scientifically proven that people who have stable lives and are loved very rarely give into drug addiction, drug addiction preys on a part of our brain that is lacking love. Visit your brother, encourage him to get help and most of all love him but don\u2019t give him money. Take him to the doctor help him get food stamps find clinics that he can sign up for things like that. Complete inaction isn\u2019t love", "NTA. Your brother isn't your responsibility", "NTA. Although you are going to have to appear to be one if you ever want this to stop and him to get better. Dealing with the same thing with an addict sibling. Anything you do that puts you in a good headspace only enables them. You have to be TA and risk their condemnation for any meaningful progress to get made. I cut mine off completely after one such occurrence and while I feel like crap about it, I know it's the only way. Do yourself and him a favor and sever ties. Be the AH even though you aren't. Until it gets better. It's the only way.", "NTA.  If/when you feel guilty, remember that addicts are master manipulators!  Your brother has honed his craft after all these years.  Cut him off financially, no exceptions, and limit your contact.  You don\u2019t deserve to be treated this way.", "NTA. You can't fix someone who doesn't want to be fixed. I have a BIL who has ruined his life with his bad choices and is wondering why his kids won't talk to him anymore. Stay as far away from him as you are able. If he is stealing from your parents he will steal from you.", "NTA. I'm an addict, 15 months clean this time. \n\nIt is not 'a couple of pills/drinks/smokes/shots', and the money is actually needed for 'his fine/kids/bond/liscence'.\n\nHe is absolutely getting on, and the best thing you can do is cut him off and explain why.\n\n He won't react well but listen to me when I say this: You are enabeling him. You may as well buy him the drugs and stick the fit in his arm because you are with extra steps.\n\nYou can't help an addict until they want the help, and they won't want it if you are enabling them.", "NTA. You love him and support him. Your support is not enabling him. Sometimes you need to let ppl to fall hard to make them want to change. You can't really help someone who takes no responsibility of their action. I recommed to go no contact to save your mental health.", "You cannot help him.  He cannot stay clean for his own sake or even to be father to his son, a victim here.\n\nIf you want to help, reach out to your nephew;  He has 2 addicts for parents and could probably use love and support.", "he wasn't going to use the 20$ to take the kid to KFC and everyone knows it.\n\nyou are NTA.", "NTA, and stop paying for the car.", "You cannot help him. He has to want help and start by helping himself.\n\nThe situation is a tragedy but that's the reality.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Is the car in your name? If so, you need to get it back before he ends up hitting and killing someone while drunk or high. If it is not, then you need to quit paying for it. He needs to hit rock bottom, even if that means making him homeless. Let your parents know before you do this because he will show up on their doorstep looking for money or a place to live. The only place he needs to go is rehab, but he has to want to go and to get sober.", "NTA.  That's because it IS your only choice.  You simply cannot sustain any kind of relationship with an active addict.  All you are is an ATM machine to to them.  And why are you paying for a car, when he could kill or paralyze some innocent person with it?", "NTA Dude is a walking talking breathing hazard to associate with. He\u2019s manipulative and thinks he\u2019s a victim when the victim here is his child and the people he robbed.", "Yea it wouldn't go to KFC, unless that is the name for a new drug", "I am going to print out some of these responses and show them to my parents. My dad is so sick over this and lives like a prisoner in his own home, praying my brother doesn\u2019t show up and cause a scene. His doctor put him on anxiety meds. He needs to read this. Thank you.", "We know this. He tries to manipulate us and play on our emotions to get money. It\u2019s always his kid which has gotten more difficult for him to do now that he doesn\u2019t have custody.", "Thank you. And I know, that was just one example of the hundreds of excuses he has made up to try to get money.", "Thank you. He has been arrested but never stays in jail more than a few days. My dad wants to get a PFA but can\u2019t since he doesn\u2019t threaten physical harm. The mental abuse is just as bad though. Basically when he shows up there my mom calls the cops and either he\u2019s gone by the time they show up, or if they find him they issue a warning. \n\nHe stalks my dad, showing up in the yard at 4:30am when he is leaving for work so he can corner him alone. He knows my mom will call the cops. My dad is easier to break down and gives him money sometimes. His doctor has him on anxiety meds and I\u2019m honestly worried about him. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see my dad so broken over this. \n\nWe are trying to stand our ground, but some days it\u2019s easier said than done. I\u2019m 30 miles away so he won\u2019t show up here and get in my face and bawl his eyes out like he does to my parents.  Instead he texts me pictures and screenshots to try to prove why he needs money. I mostly ignore or block him but then something happens and my parents call which gets me involved all over again.  I\u2019m just praying this all ends soon.", "He might just trade the food for drugs, though.", "There is so much wrong with this that I can't even. And I won't. One can hope however you never have to make the decision OP is contemplating. Should you ever, you may begin to question your definition of love.", "I know from everything I have read that continuing to help him financially is the worst thing I can do. Being kind and supportive is difficult with his current mental state of lashing out when he doesn\u2019t get what he wants (money). \n\nBut I question myself up constantly, wondering if there is something else I could be doing.  Or will I have to live with the guilt of not doing more if he commits suicide or overdoses? He really has nobody. He has burned all his bridges and has no support system.  He is alone in his car with no source of income.  I know he is dirty, hungry, and tired. I offered to help him find rehab and he just laughed at me and said that he not an addict. Drug charges and the fact that he is 37 and homeless doesn\u2019t stop him from explaining it all away though. I guess if he is going to live in denial there is nothing I can do for him.  Thank you for the advice. I just needed reassurance that there is nothing more I can do at this point.", "Thank you. You sure do know all the excuses \u2026 those are his favorites.  He would tell us he had to pay his \u2018fines\u2019 and if he didn\u2019t pay $500 a month he will go to jail.  I called BS, pulled up his dockets and found out he had never paid a dime. In fact there is a hearing coming up for non-payment and he could get on a payment plan for $25 a month.  He didn\u2019t even do that.  \n\n\nCongrats on your sobriety \ud83d\ude4c", "I know. He lives in it but the next time it gets impounded because he\u2019s driving it unregistered without a license I am taking it. It is my car and my name is on the title.", "I co-signed for it but later found out I\u2019m actually a co-borrower which means I have more financial responsibility and my name is also on the title. It does not mean I have liability if something happens. I believe because his credit was so bad that this was the only way to secure a loan for him. I  have previously looked into it but I will again. Thanks.", "One of my siblings got into hard drugs in high school. There were years where we had times not knowing where she was or if we\u2019d get a call something had happened. She has been clean for almost ten years and I still have anxiety sometimes about her and how she\u2019s doing. \n\nNot knowing if she was okay, or even where she was, or if she would ever be the person I knew and loved again will always be one of the hardest things I have ever dealt with and I know my parents would say the same. \n\nUltimately, you can love someone and still distance yourself when they are making decisions that put you at risk. Please know it\u2019s okay to protect yourselves, physically but also emotionally from this stranger. Your brother isn\u2019t all there right now. If y\u2019all aren\u2019t in therapy or connected with a support group, that could really help. My heart hurts for y\u2019all. It\u2019s one thing to know we can\u2019t control other people\u2019s decisions and another to be so powerless as we see someone we love desperately destroy their life piece by piece.\n\nTake care of yourselves, be gentle to yourself and know that it is okay to have a boundary that, unless he is willing to get sober, you are going to be LC or NC with him. I don\u2019t know if this is an option, but pour as much of that love you wish you could give your brother into your nephew. Good luck!", "You should try looking at Al-Anon and other groups for family members of people who have substance abuse problems.  It might help your father understand he is not alone and that these struggles are a common part of the problem.", "NTA.  Like another person said, he hadsn't hit rock bottom yet.  Until he does that, nothings going to change, because he doesn't want to change.  The addict mentality will always blame their problems on something or someone else.", "This is so horrible. Can your parents sell the house and move without telling him where they are going. Alternatively, cameras to support a restraining order?", "Awful!!  Restraining order, and did you dad file theft for the things he stole?", "You can't do any more. If he is incapable of seeing the bed he made for himself when he wakes up in the morning, nothing you do will change that. He has to change himself. Your presence in his life will be used as an excuse to not change. He will assume things aren't that bad if you are still there helping. You being there gives him a choice. You have to remove that choice and thus yourself. It is one of the most difficult things I have ever had to do, but it was necessary. You will not like yourself for a bit but you will have done the right thing and you can find strength in that and live your life instead of feeling like you're just a part of his.", "You can't help him if he doesn't want to be helped. That person is not the brother you knew anymore. The addiction consumes people and turns them into strangers. It's sad but true.", "You should, if it is in your name, you may get into trouble when he is driving it uninsured or with expired license.  That is a whole lot of trouble that could come down on you as the legal owner that allowed an unlicensed individual to drive your car.  Think he gets in an accident and kills someone, all of the sudden, everything you have built up is erased in one lawsuit, and as the vehicle owner, they will come after you too.", "Can't you report it stolen then? Did he steal it, or did you let him have it?", "If your name is on the title, then you can be sued.", "There is an order that he is not allowed on the property. It\u2019s a small town and the cops don\u2019t have a lot to do so they patrol around their house a lot. Several reports have been filed now so next is harassment charges. \n\nI think they filed charges for the credit card theft. And there was no proof he took the cards because by the time my dad realized it the cards were long gone. We tried to find where he sold them online (eBay, FB) but didn\u2019t have any success. My dad was actually showing his collection to my husband when he realized the valuable cards weren\u2019t there. My dad cried, and I have never seen him cry. It was a 1969 Topps New York Mets set he collected as a child. It meant a lot more than money to him. Addiction sure makes you do despicable and unforgiving things.", "Thank you. I\u2019m sorry you went through this too. I hope the person in your life is in a better place now.", "Of course. But I will probably never know for certain if they are alright or not. I only hear things secondhand and I never ask. My choice. Not theirs. That's where the power is. And you need to grasp that and never let go. On the plus side, what happened was so despicable there really isn't anywhere else to go but up. So there's that. I've made peace with it. Eventually you will too."]}
