A month ago I brought up that we should time it a little differently because my son (1 year old male birthday in feb) needs a nap and already has issues with being at their house. He doesn't like going there for some reason and won't really let us put him down. We made a break through with that when we were making these plans because he got a full nap in (noon to 3) right before we left for their house and he warmed up and actually seemed good about being there. \n\nMy MIL and I decided that we'd all meet up at her house around 5 so he can get a real nap and actually eat when he gets there and warm up better so we can all enjoy ourselves. My BIL called her yesterday and I guess she never relayed the info to him that we were doing dinner later and said he was going to his girlfriends mom's at 6 and wants to do dinner at noon at my MILs. \n\nShe called my husband just now crying (literally hyperventilating apparently) because my BIL wants to change the time and asked my husband if that's okay. This is where we got into a fight about it. \n\nI am a sahm and he works full time. I fully believe in children having naps up to 7 years old because it's good for development. I got upset with him because I said well we've been planning this for a month and if I knew the time was going to change I would have changed his sleep schedule but I'm not going to go there and just have an upset child because he didn't get his nap and he's not going to eat at all because he didn't get his nap and doesn't eat until 4. He's mad at me saying well he's going to have to do alot of things in life he doesn't want to do so who cares if he doesn't get a real nap. \nI care because we're going to be dealing with a screaming child and not be able to eat ourselves. So no. We can go at the time we said we were going. \n\nI know the world doesn't revolve around our child's nap. But our child does not revolve around our schedule we revolve around his. I got upset because I didn't understand why he wasn't putting our child first over a dinner. \n\n\nI get I could be the asshole and just skip his nap all together but I don't get how that's fair to our son?\n\n\nIdk reddit you tell me am I the asshole? I'll answer whatever questions yall have\n\n\n\nEdited his age for those confused\n\n\nEdit number 2. \nI give up. Not fighting it anymore and just going when they say. Everyone else's happiness matters more and I just don't care anymore.", "created_utc": 1669234048, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2z3cg/aita_for_not_budging_on_skipping_my_sons_nap_time/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There would be carnage.\n\nNothing worse than an overtired toddler.", "NTA...A child who doesn't get their nap can make dinner hell for everyone. Your MIL knew this, understood this, and agreed to change the time. If you go and your son misbehaves, make sure your husband and BIL get up and deal with it.", "NTA, changing plans expecting everyone to roll with it at the last minute is not cool, that kind of thing drives me nuts. If BIL is so desperate to eat at noon, he can play nanny for the screaming child. \n\nAlso to move dinner six hours earlier is a huge burden for the hosts/people cooking?? That\u2019s so rude!", "You are NTA at all. Nor should changing your sons sleep schedule even be something you should have considered. \n\nYour MIL agreed to a 5 pm meetup.   \nIt's her fault she did not relay the message to those attending.   \n\n\n>He's mad at me saying well he's going to have to do alot of things in life he doesn't want to do so who cares if he doesn't get a real nap. \n\n\"Asshole\" isn't even a strong enough word for this kind of mentality.", "NTA, dinner at noon...? that's already just weird by itself", "NTA.  \n\nBut the whole \"naps until 7\" thing is likely to work. One, kids go to school and there aren't naps. Two, most kids give up naps long before they are 7. Mine were all between 2 and 4 when they stopped napping unless they were ill. Forced naps aren't goof for anyone.", "NTA. Some kids can skip naps and rearrange schedules and be mostly fine.  Others absolutely can not,  at least not until they're closer to 4 or 5. Toddlers,  especially ones that are barely out of infancy,  don't have the ability to \"suck it up\". The idea that they can is ridiculous. The situation can quickly become a hellscape.  \n\nIt sounds to me like MIL dropped the ball and is now throwing it in your husband's hands to deal with. Now he's trying to place the consequences of her actions (or inaction) in your lap.  Tell him his choices are to assume 100% of childcare for Thanksgiving Day and the 2 days after (thus taking responsibility for the consequences of his decision) or to bring you guys a plate and enjoy the time with his family.  Either way,  put your feet up for a moment and relax.", "NTA - You know what's best for your son as the primary caregiver. Your husband can suck it up. We all know you're the one that will deal with your screaming child while he enjoys Thanksgiving. \nHusband is the AH, so is BIL for last minute change in plans. Obviously the men in that family believe they can do whatever and the women just go along.", "We always had things we couldn\u2019t do because of nap schedules.  It\u2019s just what life is like with toddlers. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to go. It\u2019s just going to be you traveling to have a miserable time taking care of a screaming and tired child. What\u2019s the point of putting either of you through it. I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s such a big deal for some people to see that some kids just can\u2019t do parties at certain times. If it\u2019s gonna be that time then sorry we can\u2019t do it. If I see you I would stay home. NTA all the way. \n\nI really don\u2019t understand all these posts about this effecting hour toddler in the future since he needs to learn to be flexible. He hasn\u2019t got the ability to understand at all what that means right now. It\u2019s all about what his body needs to develop in those really early years.", "NTA. I got so mad for you just reading your post. You took the time to make a plan that meets the needs of your child, coordinated with your MIL, all for the plans to be thrown aside because two grown adults aren\u2019t capable of communicating. \n\nWho waits for the day before thanksgiving to schedule time, knowing they have other plans they need to accommodate?", "NTA \n\nArrive at the agreed upon time. \n\nIf others arrive earlier, that's okay. If dinnertime is changed. That's okay. If dinnertime isn't changed, that's okay\n\nYour MIL is hosting. \n\nYour infant son does, in fact, need the nap. Your son, along with everyone in attendance, will be distressed if he doesn't get a nap.", "NTA -  I get it especially because i am sure DH won't be the one dealing with the screaming 1yo\n\nCould he go over for noon and you and your baby go after he wakes up from nap?  Best of both worlds?", "NTA all the way! \n\n1 yr old need their naps and we can\u2019t mess with their sleep schedule a few days away before the event! \n\nLet them have it earlier and say see you all at 4:30pm. \u00ab\u00a0Sorry to miss you this year BIL.\u00a0\u00bb\n\nMIL didn\u2019t relay the correct time. It isn\u2019t your fault.", "Nta so you all planned for dinner at 5?  And she never told him?  That's on her.  If they insist at noon, tell them you'll be there after his nap and plan to eat left overs.", "NTA.  I completely understand.  I missed several of my nephew's and niece's birthdays due to my kids' nap times.  I could have skipped the naps, but the kids would have been MISERABLE.  I'm, thankfully, getting out of the nap time routine (kids are 6 and 3.  3 year old still naps, but if she misses one, it's not too bad).", "You stay home and he can take your son and deal with it lol.", "NTA, if your husband works full time, then I doubt he deals with the consequences of a grumpy (?) child, since you would make sure the child gets his naps. Obviously he won't understand how stressful it is for you to be in this situation. If you must go early, make him responsible for the child. He wants to make the choice to go early despite his own son's needs, he will be held responsible for it then. I think after being exposed to a situation like this, your husband will respect your decisions about your child more. I think is unfair to put you under a stressful situation for something you had no voice about.\n\nAlso, dinner at noon? Did I interpreted that correctly? That's crazy. Why can't you guys have dinner a bit later, so your child gets SOME sleep and your BIL can stay with the family a bit before leaving.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve run into a few people who weren\u2019t understanding about naps and scheduling and it really sucks. IMO, you just shouldn\u2019t go at all.", "NTA. You\u2019re talking about a literal very young toddler and you made the plans first. Maybe MIL offers you leftovers when you arrive - that\u2019s a reasonable compromise.

Stick to your guns, you know what is best for your child.", "NTA for not wanting to mess with your baby\u2019s nap time routine\n\nBut, and I say this with all kindness, don\u2019t hold your breath for your kids napping past the age of about 3/4 at most. Every child is different, of course, but this means that the age that children outgrow the need to nap in the day is different, but only very few children still need them past 4yrs, mostly they just need a longer sleep at night (and any nap they had taken in the day = earlier mornings the next day, especially for a 7y/o)", "NTA - Send Hubby and son over early and claim you are not feeling well and take a nap at home :)", "NTA : I\u2019d go with having contractions during the 1pm \u201cdinner\u201d and needing to lie down at MIL house and then back home.

You relax and make DH pay", "NTA and please do not take him to another room when he\u2019s screaming at the dinner table.

The ILs have super helpful tips like just nap him here or skip the nap. But no one spends the 45 minutes trying to convince a toddler to nap somewhere new with tons of loud people. And when he doesn\u2019t nap, it\u2019s all why is he cranky? You need to control your kid, blah blah blah.\nI understand the frustration and whatever you do, remember it\u2019s one day and you will make it! \nYou are NoT the AH! \nHappy thanksgiving.", "NTA\nFor me it\u2019s not about the nap schedule (though I was pretty strict about those when my kids were small also), it\u2019s that you had a plan in place for a month, and they changed it on you at the last minute.", "NTA. Every time your son starts screaming, hand him to your husband or MIL.", "It\u2019s one day lol. The child can surely miss one day. This sound so crazy that a babies nap time can\u2019t be amended on one day. So if you had a appointment, or you went shopping and the car broke down or a family member called and needed your help. Would you answer be sorry I can\u2019t my baby needs to nap. Ridiculous, this is why children nowadays grow up so spoilt and entitled because over compensating parents think the whole world should revolve around little Charley!!!!", "Soft YTA.  While it\u2019s beneficial for children to take naps, you\u2019re being unreasonably rigid. Routine is a good thing, but children must also learn to be flexible (just like adults).  It\u2019s as important that your son build strong relationships with his family, and if you\u2019re unwilling to bend and compromise with others he probably won\u2019t get the chance to do that. Think about this - because you don\u2019t want him to miss one nap, on one day, your MIL is almost hysterical, possibly won\u2019t see her grandchild on an important family holiday, your husband is angry at you, he may not be able to spend much time with his own brother on a family holiday\u2026all because you don\u2019t want your child to (possibly) miss one nap. It sounds as though you DO believe the world (or at least your little corner of it) revolves around your child\u2019s nap, and you don\u2019t think you\u2019re being controlling by dictating when everyone else should celebrate their holiday. \n\nAll this rigidity will probably backfire in a serious way once your new baby is born. What happens if your 1 year old isn\u2019t able to lay down for a nap in his room at exactly the time he\u2019s used to then? Not only will he have to get used to sharing mommy, but he won\u2019t know how to self-soothe when his schedule isn\u2019t followed exactly. Be careful, you may be setting yourself, your 1 year old and your infant up for a much more difficult time than necessary by not teaching him  how to be flexible now.", "Yeah, I was leaning y-t-a but this was Really last minute.  The person who had the wrong info is the party who has to suck it up imo.", "What's happening between 3 and 5? Is it a two hour drive? He could sleep on the way.", "Sorry, soft YTA\n\nIt's one day for your son, yes he will be fuzzy, but not because the nap, but because the travel, other people around, other noises, etc..\n\nBIL is working and has not the time frame like you.\nThe whole family does not has to tiptoe around your child, especially not by holidays.\nIt's a special event, your child will survive, I promise.\nDon't play the difficult Heli mom, for your own sake. Enjoy quality family time without starting unnecessary drama, please. \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA. You are correct naps are good for kids.  It is also good for kids and parents to learn to be flexible.  It is also good for children to spend time with family on holidays.  Skipping one nap, delaying one nap is of no consequence to anyone in the long term.  However being inflexible and rigid and being unable to adapt to slight changes in schedule does have long term negative impact.  I think you are way over the top in this situation and i think you need to learn to compromise for your own sake as well as the sake of your child", "Soft YTA. While I completely understand the need for naps, your conflict is no more or less important than anyone else's. Both parties should be attempting a compromise. You aren't. Perhaps BIL should meet his dinner slightly later or just accept that he won't get much family time because he failed to communicate. Perhaps you can put your child down for a nap earlier, bring some comfort objects that will help him cope, take turns entertaining him so that you can each eat, plan to go home earlier so that he can go to bed earlier afterwards. There ARE things you can do to accommodate an earlier time, but you are being very rigid.\n\nAt this point, you have no idea how long your child will sleep or what their temperament will be that day. You could demand the time be 5 pm and then your child only sleeps until 2 pm! If the time is moved slightly earlier, do what you can to plan ahead and accommodate it, then just relax and go with the flow. You'll all survive. Everyone will understand if your son is a bit disruptive. Don't stress so much. \n\nLife most certainly does not revolve around your son's nap, so the more practiced you get at managing outings, the better off you'll be.", "I\u2019m confused. You said he has been doing better at their house so why can\u2019t he nap while you guys eat then he can eat after?", "If you\u2019re driving, this will resolve itself.

Then make a plan that next year you are going to see your family", "Can you drive there early, give your son a quick lunch and put him down for a nap at the in-laws house? He\u2019d sleep 12/12:30-3ish while all the adults enjoy the meal at 1 and when he wakes he can snack on whatever he likes from the table and some dessert?\n\n\nNTA btw. Our events always worked around our kids napping/bedtime schedules. Cranky kids made everyone miserable.", "Exactly what I was thinking! Gotta go lay down, pregnant and feeling ill you know... Now everyone gets to see the consequences of their decisions.", "Definitely the plan", "Yo, like honestly the hours of peace and calm sounds so much better. And you can always pull something out of the fridge or freezer", "Agreed.  \n\nBesides, I have literally seen a toddler cry until they puke.   Profusely.    Sometime it is the only way the have to get out bad emotions.", "But make sure it\u2019s the reality.", "If you have two cars and can drive, get queasy or have a preggo migraine mid-morning and \u201cpush through\u201d to help assemble what he needs to bring the toddler to MIL. Join him \u201clater\u201d after you can lay down for a while - like 4:30 or so.", "I\u2019m so sorry OP. Being pregnant and taking care of a two year old is so hard! Two year olds require so much energy, energy you don\u2019t  have because you\u2019re trying to grow a whole, new human.   \nIf your husband isn\u2019t prioritizing you, make him and BIL care for your son.  Unfortunately, some partners don\u2019t get how hard it is to deal with meltdowns when they\u2019re  not doing the lion\u2019s share of the child rearing. You asking if he even likes you and your son is profoundly sad.  \nINFO: does he split chores and childcare at home?", "this combined with your edit has me thinking you *need* to get out of there as soon as you can.", "Anyone who has ever interacted with a toddler who\u2019s missed a nap knows that this is for everyone\u2019s benefit, including the kid\u2019s.", "Most parents know that naps are healthy and good for development of young children and the downtime is good for the caregivers.", "Hon, are you isolated?  Do you have friends?  Do you talk to your family with any frequency?  Have you thought about rejoining the workforce after your baby is born?", "Please let us know how it goes.", "100% this. If you have to ask yourself this once, it's worth considering. If you're asking yourself this everyday, you need to get the hell out of this relationship.", "Yes. That\u2019s the answer. Ask OP who you don\u2019t know from a bar to soap to leave her husband. Excellent suggestion. I\u2019m sure OP and their son\u2019s sleep will be so much the better for it.", "He's a great dad and takes great care of him. He does not do chores around the house. He's only doing the literboxes bc I'm pregnant", "I hate that this happened. My ex husband was carrying on about how he was hungry and his stomach hurt while I was 8 hours into labor with no epidural. Then he was mad that it wasn\u2019t over yet because he wanted to watch something on TV and couldn\u2019t watch it on my room while I was giving birth and I probably wouldn\u2019t be done in time.", "I've honestly really isolated but that's my own doing. Moving here was out of a whim and I suffer from really bad anxiety and depression so making friends is hard. I have a few online friends. My family and I talk sometimes but all of us run on a independent thing to where we really only talk when something is wrong or it's a birthday/holiday. We like giving each other space. And yeah when my youngest is in prek I'm going back into bartending", "I will. Will update tomorrow night around 8ish", "Remind me! 2 days", "Is this the life you want for yourself?  If it's not, you have options.", "Wow. If you\u2019re happy with this that\u2019s ok (but not fair). If you want equity, you need to get your husband to help out. Being the breadwinner shouldn\u2019t mean that you can abdicate domestic responsibilities.", "Me too. I kind of hate that everyone wants to be there too. I invited my mom. She came with my stepfather without asking me. After I had the baby and she was sleeping and I finally started to fall asleep here comes the in-laws. No nap for me. It\u2019s all baby for everyone else. \n\nBut I bet I was more hungry than your ex lol. When I finally got breakfast after labor, it was the best breakfast ever. I ate every bite. I had to go to the hospital a week ago and I didn\u2019t get to eat. I started telling them how good that breakfast was. People who complain about hospital food didn\u2019t get to eat my breakfast lol. I will be in my death bed still going on about that breakfast lol.", "I guess most parents that have a regular nap schedule are selfish. Alllriiightteeeethen.", "Was it a whim for both of you, or was it just a whim for you?", "I wish I could downvote you more than once."]}
