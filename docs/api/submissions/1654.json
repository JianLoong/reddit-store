She's trying to use you", "NTA - where my mind goes is this: how many other people closer to her (family, close friends, etc.) did she have to alienate before she got way down the list to asking you?", "Sounds like she's surfed every last couch and burned every last bridge.

Why would you move a complete stranger into your home or hand them hundreds/thousands of dollars.\n\nThe people telling you that you are an A H are free to move her into their home and give her their money. You could even DM her their phone numbers to help facilitate that.", "Asking a favour immediately after saying sorry is like saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026\u201d it negates the sorry and makes it meaningless. She\u2019s not sorry, she wants money.", "NTA - it's kind of you to forgive her, but you are NOT obligated to provide money and free housing (!!) for your high school bully.", "NTA. She apologized so she could manipulate you into giving her money.", "NTA she\u2019s only apologizing because she wants something from you. There\u2019s no way in hell someone would give money/shelter to someone who bullied them and never apologized but if they apologize there is a small chance it might happen.

You don't owe it to anyone to forgive them. And even if you do, forgiveness does not mean a return to the former status quo. \n\n>Aryanna accused me of still being mad over what happened in high school and holding it against her.\n\nThat's is your prerogative.

ANYONE asking for money especially after having not spoken for YEARS would strike people as weird and definitely make them feel uncomfortable. Your family saying you're in the wrong can assist her if they feel so strongly about the situation but you have every right to choose how you want to spend your money and who you choose to invest your time in. There's no telling really how letting them move in with you would go, especially if you take into consideration how often couples alone struggle with adjusting to one another even after having been together for years. It simply sounds like a last ditch effort by reaching out to you and it's also kind of insulting to get mad at you saying you're still holding a grudge while she's actively trying to solicit help from you. It just screams \"I'm trying to use you\".", "This person is almost a stranger to OP now and if she didn't need something from OP, then it's likely she wouldn't have heard from her 7 years later, maybe never.  NTA.", "NTA.  You haven't spoken to her in years and now you're expected to roll out the red carpet and open up your wallet?  Your family members can help Aryanna themselves if they feel so strongly about it.", "Sooo this is totally ridiculous of you to ask. Of course you are NTA!\n\nYou are under 0 obligation to help her. \n\n\nI cannot stress this enough NTA!!!!", "NTA she was sorry enough only 7 years later when she wants something from you. If your family feel bad for her, they can help her. Your financial position is irrelevant, she hasn't been your friend for a long time.", "I can\u2019t believe your family thinks you\u2019re wrong for this. She just randomly popped up after 7 years to apologize and then ask for money and free housing? \n\nNTA", "nta, this is NOT about highschool, this is about someone you literally don't know. Would you invite any tom, dick, or jane off the street to live in your home? Especially when you might not be at home (going to work, errands, etc).", "Nta. Forgiving doesn't have to mean inviting that person back into your life, having them move in or giving them money.

Not your problem.", "NTA\n\nShe is reaching out to you because the first 25 or so people she reached out to all said \u201cno\u201d.  \n\nYou can probably guess why she wants money.  Hint:  it\u2019s not for a hotel.", "NTA. Absolutely ridiculous for her to be asking for anything from you after how she treated you. She definitely only reached out because she wanted to hit you up for money.", "NTA. She\u2019s nothing but a stranger now,  but worse she\u2019s a stranger who used to bully you. The fact that she\u2019d even ask for help is appalling to me.", "NTA and she probably isn't even sorry, she just sees you as a soft touch that she can manipulate. Do not let her in your home (don't even tell her where you live) and don't give her any money. Regardless of her circumstances (if any of it is even true), she's not your responsibility. Her family and current friends should be helping her, not someone far in her past", "NTA. If the apology had occurred before the request for help, I'd be on board with helping and judge differently. You're not responsible for her position either way, of course, I'd just be more inclined to help if the apology didn't come with a price tag.", "NTA. This is hard but you are not personally obligated to help others in this situation. It\u2019s wonderful you\u2019ve forgiven her, but it can\u2019t be your responsibility to fix things for her", "Your family members criticizing you are the AH. Let them take her in if they're so virtuous. Geez. \n\nNTA. \n\nLook up some resources for her and send them to her. Homeless shelter addresses, soup kitchens. Does she have no family?", "NTA the apology was very close to handout request. So is suspicious. \n\nOf you want to help send her info on women's shelters and unemployment offices.  You are not obligated to finance her life in any way. And you knew her as a kid. Theres no way to know that know as an adult if she has any criminal history or drug issues. So don't let her move in.", "NTA. Did your family members offer to put her up? There's a HUGE red flag here. She has NO friends to put her up, NO family of any kind willing to help her out. Why? Why is she calling a former victim from seven years ago? Your concerned family members can club together and help her stay in a hotel for a week. It's not your concern nor your responsibility and I'd be very leery of anyone who has to resort to someone they parted on bad terms with and haven't talked to in 7 years.  \n\n\nWant to know why she called YOU? You were nice. You didn't snap back at the bullying. She knows she can guilt you into this and get away with stuff while living there. She doesn't think you'll put your foot down. Don't worry about it. DO give her the contact info for any relatives. \"Uncle Buck sounded really concerned. Here's his FB contact. You can ask him directly.\"", "NTA. \n\nShe is only sorry because she needs something. Also how great of a person is she really if the person she needs helps from is someone she hasn\u2019t spoken to in years?", "NTA. you havent been in contact for years now. she could have become a drug addict or something, its not safe. And anyways you are under no obligation to provide for someone if you dont want to.", "NTA.   And she didn't reach out to you in order to apologize.   She needed something and an apology meant that she would be more likely to influence you.", "NTA\u2014 Unless you have a habit of letting people you hardly know move in with you or take your money, no one should be surprised you are not \u201chelping\u201d this woman.  Seven years is a long time.  You don\u2019t know her.  Even if you had parted as friends, the separation of 7 years is enough that you have no obligation to her.\n\nThis woman should have more recent friends (as well as family) that she can turn to.  If she is coming to you after all this time, it may be because she has exhausted and/or alienated everyone else.\n\nDon\u2019t give her a penny or she will keep coming back for more.  She sounds like a user.", "Of course you're NTA.  Frankly its asinine for anyone to say that you are cruel for not letting someone you have had no contact with for 7 years into your home. You are   no more responsible for Aryanna's consequences from a bad relationship than you were for her terrible behavior in high school. \n\nI would honestly block her entirely because the fact that she just now (when she's over a barrel) decided to make her grand apology feels manipulative. There are homeless and domestic violence shelters in every city in the US that she is free to utilize. Or you can give her info to your relatives and suggest they take her in and see how fast they walk back their suggestion. Good luck OP, keep moving forward.", "OP we match \n\nI don't let ppl I haven't spoken to in years sleep in my house either, also I don't tend to go out my way to give loads of money to them either.", "NTA, real freind would not have to ask. You would know to help them.", "NTA - shes basically a stranger at this point", "NTA. Let them take her in.", "NTA, if your family members have a problem with how you handled things give them Ayana's contact information and tell them to feel free to send her money themselves. You're not obliged to do anything for her. Send her an amount that you'd feel comfortable giving anyone in need, or don't send her anything at all. You don't owe her a thing", "NTA. She can call the guy from the popular group she was trying to get into when she dissed you. Wonder why he isn't in her life? You don't owe her anything, even a link for help. One response and she'll glob onto you and won't let go.", "NTA, where was she all these years. She is the A-hole and she is just trying to use you.", "NTA.  she only apologized to get money or help.  She has had 7 years to apologize without an attachment of needing help so it doesn\u2019t seem sincere.", "NTA!\n\nShe\u2019s not sorry, she contacted you after all these years and \u201capologized\u201d because she wants something from you.\n\nIf she\u2019s calling you, after all those years, that tells me she probably burned every other possibility first.", "NTA. A lot can happen in 7 years, especially when you\u2019re just starting out. Why doesn\u2019t she have anyone else to contact? Where are her family and other friends?  I wouldn\u2019t give her money or let her stay with you. That could be a really hard situation to get out of once you\u2019re in it.", "Wtf, NTA.  Her \u201capology\u201d was not even close to being genuine.  She was an ass to you as a kid and is still being an ass as she is trying to manipulate and guilt trip you.", "NTA After you told her no and she immediately went on the aggressive defence, you should've replied \"I am in no way responsible for your lifestyle upkeep and just because we were friends once, doesn't mean I know you now well enough to host you in my home.\"", "NTA, you aren't friends.\n\nI'm sure one of her high school friends could help her.", "NTA as unfortunate as her situation is, it's ridiculous to put you on the spot.

No expectation, no request, just an honest 'I screwed up and I'm sorry and I hope you know it wasn't your fault'. \n\nI wasn't carrying any anything from it - we were kids; we were both weird, odd kids out in a way that really really didn't mesh, especially in grade school, and honestly, he'd stepped in to help me in high school in a way he really didn't have to and that actually put him at physical risk - as far as I was concerned, that slate had been wiped clean long ago. But, in the midst of a tough recovery from a brutal pregnancy, I had a good long cry from that message, and I did feel a hell of a lot better. \n\nOP, you don't owe this former friend a damn thing - she's not actually interested in apologizing, only in what she can get from you.

Honestly I don\u2019t think she\u2019s changed, if she would\u2019ve changed she would have reached out long before she needed help. She is just trying to use anybody she can.

For all you know she\u2019s on drugs and will rob you blind. I\u2019m not saying that she absolutely is, but you wouldn\u2019t know because you\u2019ve not spoken to her for years. There has to be a reason she\u2019s so desperate to reach out to someone she\u2019s not wanted anything to do with for that long. Why did she not reach out to her family or a friend? Maybe she already has and they don\u2019t trust her for some reason. Her being pushy with you only implies she\u2019s still a bully. I\u2019d absolutely not trust this.

And I'm very sensitive to people trying to escape abuse whether I know them well or not, so I'd probably give her money,  although i would NEVER have her move in with me. But you not wanting to give her money is fine too. Maybe your family who think you're the AH should all contribute to a pot, maybe you'd even be comfortable contributing a bit, rather than financing the whole thing.", "Had she reached out and apologized PRIOR to be in a bad situation then maybe you\u2019d have a different opinion. I doubt she\u2019s sincere in her apology.", "If she's down to calling people she ghosted 7 years ago, just how many bridges has she burned?", "i really hate to say it but the only persons in my life that have ever reached out to me in this way ended up only needing the money for d\\*rugs :(", "And what part of OP is supposed to believe she has grown past her bullying and peer pressure phases when saying no to an unreasonable request from someone not heard from in nearly a decade turns into the brigade of the flying monkeys?

You haven't heard from her for 7 years and suddenly she wants to move in with you and money to boot.  Wow!", "NTA - I agree with others, she isn\u2019t a former friend who\u2019s apologizing.

But now that you won't be useful I'm sure you will prison never hear from her again.", "NTA.\n\nEven if she had never bullied you, and you simply had drifted apart over the years, it would be weird to send someone money or have them move in with you. That kind of help is reserved for friends, drifting apart means you are no longer friends.\n\nOf course leaving a bad relationship is tough, but putting all the eggs in one basket and not having a way out to the point that she needs to ask someone she has not talked to in years seems extremely unhealthy. I would have expected her to ask family and friends, not exfriends.", "NTA: the few family members can reach out and help her first. You don't owe anyone anything just because you can.

She's essentially a stranger at this point.  Why would you let a stranger stay in your home??", "NTA, she wouldn't have apologized, if she didn't knew, that she won't get something.

It is beyond bizarre that she would ask to live with you.\n\nResearch some shelter addresses and outreach programs and send them to her with your best wishes.", "NTA. You don't owe anyone anything. Even if you were friends a long time ago.", "NAH  . At the end of the day it's your money and you are entitled to do whatever you want with it.\n\nI just want to point out to those who are asking why she didn't reach out to immediate family and friends - abusers isolate their victims from their support system for this specific reason. So that when they decide to leave and reach out for help, nobody comes to their help.\n\nNgl even I would  be very suspicious if somebody i'd had no contact with for years reached out then asked for money. Very very suspicious. So while you're not fond of helping financially, if you care about helping her - which is fine if you don't, but if you do- i'd offer what you offered her but also help her find domestic abuse shelters/resources that don't necessarily include you digging in your pockets", "NTA. You\u2019ll never get rid of this leech.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you help someone you hadn't talked to or heard from in years? Let alone let them move in with you?\n\nThat makes absolutely no sense.
