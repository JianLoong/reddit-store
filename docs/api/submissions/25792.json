I have a friend (25f) who I grew up with. It is very known that she is a bit promiscuous - well a lot. I, on the other hand, do not agree with it. She believes the more skin showing the better. She will leave bars & go home with random people she just met, etc. We both know I don\u2019t agree with the behavior but that\u2019s her choice. But for my bachelorette, everyone was worried about her behavior & how she will act. So I sat down with her and expressed my concerns & the groups concerns. Explained to her that this is not a weekend of hooking up, it\u2019s a weekend to celebrate me marrying the love of my life in a few short weeks. She understood, promised to be on her best behavior, and that was that. Fast forward to the first night of the bach party. We went out drinking at bars and She\u2019s making out with anyone who looks at her, everytime you see her when she hasn\u2019t ran off somewhere she has less clothes than she did before. We\u2019re all trying to keep up with her. It gets to the point no one else is enjoying themselves because we\u2019re more worried about making sure my friend doesn\u2019t leave with a random stranger. I\u2019ve had enough. I find her in the bathroom with some guy. I start yelling at her telling her she promised to be on her best behavior and no one is having fun because we keep losing her. She disregarded everything I had just said and asks if this guy who she just met can come back with us. At this point, I am so over it. I tell her no some random guy can\u2019t come back to the hotel with us and that she needs to leave and go home now. That I was taking her back to the hotel & helping her pack & she needed to get on the first plane back home because I didn\u2019t want her there anymore. She starts crying telling me how I am being so selfish that she was just trying to enjoy herself. Now she isn\u2019t speaking to me. Everyone else at the bachelorette party agreed I did the right thing but my boss says it was kind of an asshole move for me to make her leave.

Her behaviors were causing all of you to worry about her and her whereabouts. I can't blame you for cutting her off from the group.", "NTA. She couldn\u2019t even keep it in her pants for one night after explicitly being asked to do so. You were all unable to have fun because you constantly had to keep an eye on her (and yes you HAD to do that I think, because she was putting herself in possible danger and was happily going to take a random guy to your shared hotel room which would have been gross/disturbing/dangerous for all of you). She can have all the fun with all the guys in the world in her own time, just not this once.", "For everyone saying ETA for following her around/worrying about her, you don\u2019t leave your friends especially when drinking in a place you don\u2019t know.

I also agree probably don\u2019t bring a stranger back to your hotel room that your sharing with valuables and such. \n\nWhether or not I agree with OPs thoughts about her being \u201cpromiscuous\u201d I personally could care less about a friend of mine making out with guys at the bar and having fun. But it is OPs bachelorette party and she had a discussion before going with her friend about her expectation for the night and her friend completely disregarded it. \n\nOverall NTA however the way you approached her was kinda of aggressive. You could have went about asking her to leave a different way. Telling a drunk person to pack her shit and get on the next plane is somewhat dramatic. Definitely should have been a sober AM conversation.", "Is your boss a man? Because then the comment would make sense.", "NTA--I don't love your general outlook on this person but in this situation you're not the asshole.

I guess men don\u2019t have to think about safety like women do.", "I mean some people might enjoy an orgy bachelorette. Maybe that girl in particular would like that. Not judging here.", "By that logic she could also do a strip tease at the rehearsal dinner. Yes it's her body, but there's a time and a place, and this was neither her time nor her place.", "They thought she might be drugged/raped by a rando.

WTF?", ">Her friend is TA that is incapable of not putting herself first.\n\nI agree. But why babysit her all night? OP could have brushed this off as her friend being shitty and then had fun.

You can\u2019t lose people when you are in a trip to a city you don\u2019t normally live in.", "It\u2019s called girl code- when in a different city you stay with your group. It also means someone in the group has to babysit the group to make sure they are all safe.", "I mean the friend is an adult. If she wants to get pregnant in a bar bathroom, I\u2019ll let her and enjoy my bachelorette.", "If the person is an adult and insists on getting lost, are you going to handcuff yourself to them?", "Sure you can. I've lost a friend in another city before. You wake up, call eachother and meet back up. It's not exactly rocket appliances.", "Sounds like her friends failed her then. Shouldn't have been the Brides responsibility.", "This wasn\u2019t \u201ca \u201c bar bathroom, it was a bar in a city they traveled to, and OP said they kept losing her before then.\n\nIf OP and her friends just concentrated on their fun, and their friend ended up in a bad situation in a strange city, everyone would be calling OP and her other friends TA for not \u201clooking out\u201d for this girl.", "Precisely.

So the girl would be the only one to blame. You can\u2019t always get wasted and having sex with strangers while wasted and expect your friends to help and save you everytime. It gets exhausting for everyone. That girl will end up with no friends.", "Being right is small consolation if someone actually gets hurt.\n\nYou have to suck it up and deal with the bad situation and then end the friendship after.\n\nI do question OP\u2019s other friends at the party, however. Some of them should have stepped up and dealt with the misbehaving friend so OP could concentrate on enjoying herself.", "They were all looking out for her because she kept disappearing\u2026 It\u2019s not the friends\u2019 fault OP found her first. And how do you deal with a girl like that ? Get an Uber and send her to the hotel and later come back to find an orgy in the bedroom ? So, you have to sacrifice one of the friends from the bachelorette to keep an eye on her in the hotel. Doesn\u2019t seem fair. OP wants to enjoy that night with all of her friends. And the girl didn\u2019t respect her promise. I would have just abandoned her. Which happened because now she was not allowed in the bachelorette anymore. And I hope the wedding too. Don\u2019t want the new in-laws finding her in the bathroom with a cousin or the bar man.", "She deserved to abandoned, I get it.\n\nHowever, it would suck to get married and have  the fact a person at your bachelorette was assaulted or worse hanging over everything like a black cloud.", "NTA, but why did you put in \u201cnow she isn\u2019t speaking to me\u201d? You should be the one ending the friendship based on your description of what happened. She never once thought of anything except her own gratification. That isn\u2019t a real friend."]}
