Now his mother wants to selfishly deny him those opportunities because of her daughter?! How is that fair?! He\u2019s your son, her daughter is her responsibility! So what\u2019s going to happen in the future if you set up a college fund for your son, is she going to be that parent on Reddit requesting the fund to be divided between her kids?!

My mother wouldn't let me go because she couldn't afford to send my sister.  Instead I got a poor education in schools where I was bullied and mistreated by the staff and I lost the chance at a good education and the opportunities it would have provided.

She was clueless if she assumed tuition at a private school wasn't going to be a thing. Unless you actually told her that her daughter's tuition would be free, then there's no reason to assume she wouldn't have to pay. According to one of your comments, you'd be willing to drive him if it's ever an issue for her, so I see no real problems, other than her not getting her way (which is her problem). Of course you want your kid to have the best education and opportunities possible and I kinda have to wonder about her not wanting that too. Kids with different parents can't expect everything to be equal and the same. This time it goes in your son's favor, but I'm sure there will be times it will go in her daughter's favor too.", "YTA.

You essentially tricked her into approving the private school, and now you're refusing to approve the switch back. This isn't a referendum on private vs public school, this is about you being deceptive to get this done.\n\nYou surely knew she would have to pay tuition for her daughter to attend. You apparently led her to believe you were pulling strings to get her daughter the same \"deal\" as your son.  I agree she should want the best for your son even if it's inconvenient, but you went about this the wrong way.", "YTA and it has nothing to do with which school your kid goes to.

I'm not a parent so I'm not sure about the costs of education for public school vs. private school,  but I'm assuming that the son's education being paid for by the school will free up the mother's finances to provide more for her daughter (tutors, after school programs, etc).

Your son't best interest is served by considering that, and working with his mother to help reduce the upcoming resentment, envy, jealousy, etc that may be the result of this decision. Working to mitigate those effects on your son's relationship with his sister doesn't necessarily require you to provide anything financially - I don't want you to read this as a suggestion that you pay her tuition. There are lots of ways that parents can work to help their kids through difficult situations and this is going to be an ongoing difficult situation.", "ESH - yes it was a dumb thing to assume tuition would also be free for her, but the fact that you didn\u2019t clarify that feels manipulative.\n\nAnd yes, while it might not change your desire to have your kid in a better school, this could potentially cause major friction between the children \n\nAnd finally \u201c15 minutes between schools\u201d is unlikely to mean \u201conly 15 minute increase in your ex\u2019s commute\u201d and even that adds up - you should be proactively take responsibility for getting your kid to his school especially if you are the one who really wants him there.", "NTA for wanting your son to have this opportunity.

Pretty surprising how she thought her daughter would get treated the same way as your son because the benefits that your son receive is due to the fact that you being an employee working in an organisation that allows special benefits to kids of their employees.

We both turned out fine and never once bickered about it.. if anything, it was cool that we both felt involved with social groups from two different high schools. I\u2019m smart in my own ways and he is smart in his own way and neither of us resented each other though I was a little jealous of his experience and he was jealous of mine! (He wanted to go to a big high school and have those traditional experiences).. but we were far too young to even think about the worries your ex has. I graduated a year early and went straight to school while my brother never went to college but started his own business that he still has and is killing it! My point is, we learned early that life is unfair and that circumstances are different for everybody and how to play up to our own strengths. It\u2019s her responsibility to teach her daughter that she isn\u2019t being mistreated. And respectfully, these are things she should have considered before having another kid with somebody else\u2026 it\u2019s not really your problem and your son shouldn\u2019t have to take a step back because of his sister or that she has to drive to another place\u2026 this unfortunately comes with having a mixed family most of the time. \n\nYou\u2019re a good dad!", "Has your ex remarried?  Where is the daughter's father in all of this, as you make it sound as though she alone is responsible for her daughter.", "Exactly how expensive is private elementary school for the daughter?  Did she even bother trying to get a scholarship?  Or, see if the child's grandparents would help, or possible other relatives?  You never mention the girl's father or family, so I'm confused as to they are involved, she is married to the girl's father, if she gets child support for the girl, or if she is solely responsible for the girl.", "Same here.  My mother can't say one good thing about me.  I have 3 graduate degrees, and she whined about going to graduation.  She \"doesn't remember\" that I got a scholarship to a school in the UK, and she needed to sign documents about medical insurance, next of kin, etc., and she refused.  She does remember that I was accepted early admission to university and she told the superintendent to deny my application for early graduation because \"I didn't need\" to graduate early.  I got a scholarship to a private high school, and she doesn't remember that either.", "Why would it be free? Tuition was the first thing to come to my mind, it should\u2019ve been for her as well", "There are no valid concerns about the disparity. You can't harm one kid's education just to make another kid feel better. That's absurd. Op is worried about his son. His ex wife's daughter doesn't even enter the equation, nor should she.", "here's the key in this... 'assumed.' that's her fault. not ops.", "What gets me is that the mother is worried about her daughter being resentful of not getting the same opportunities as her half brother but doesn't seem to care about the reverse of the son being denied the chance at better opportunities because of his half sister. I think the son is going to end up resenting his mother and half-sister if he gets taken out if this school when he gets older and realises that he lost those opportunities because his mother prioritised his siblings happiness over his future. I also think it's entitled of the mother that she assumed her daughter would get a free ride simply because her son to another man gets a free ride as a child of faculty. \n\nNTA, and keep your son where he is.", "INFO: **Did you reasonably believe your ex could have afforded the tuition?** Did you reasonably think that enrollment was the only real barrier?\n\nIf you knew she couldn't have afforded it, then soft Y T A, since you knew you were misleading her or you at least knew she grossly misinterpreted what you were saying and took advantage of it.  \n\n\nBut at the same time, N T A for trying to do what's best for your child.", "You need to work this out better. What happens when you have early meetings? Or when you are sick? Or what happens when school is over? Work that out now. Because your attitude on this aspect is terrible.", "I think this is a good compromise since her main concern is figuring out transportation for both kids. NTA.", "Why would anyone assume it's free for the daughter. She has no connection to a faculty member beyond the fact that her mother was to be married to OP before she was born.", "Wait. Do you mean \u201cthis is ridiculous that people are saying Y T A\u201d?", "Considering that they have equal decision making, and the daughter needs to be considered in the mom's choices, yes. She absolutely should be. \n\nLike do you even have kids? If you do I feel really bad for them.", "Honestly if even if he admitted he fully tricked her, I would argue it was NTA because it was in the best interest of the child. The mother shouldn't have been opposing it on the grounds she was in the first place. If she had a decent reason that would be one thing, but she didn't", "She got jebaited. He got his kid in a good school. The other child is none of his business. I call that a win.", "If he works at the school he can likely take the kid with him and has schoolday hours. Schools tend to be extremely kid-friendly workplaces.", "What a horrible take. She isn\u2019t his kid. It\u2019s absolutely not preferential treatment. It\u2019s actually ridiculous as a parent that you would deny one of your children better education and opportunities. That\u2019s incredibly selfish on her part.", "I think that the wife didn't think they would check OPs personnel file and see that he only has one child and realise that the kids were half siblings and therefore not eligible for free tuition. I reckon she thought she could get away with it.", ">Would you want any of your children to have fewer opportunities!!?\n\nApparently OPs ex does cause she wants OP to deny those opportunities because her daughter from her new relationship can't receive them. Someone seems to have a favourite child", "NTA. Life is not equitable. If your ex wife was that concerned about everything being the same she would have had all her kids with one man. Then both parents would expect the same for both kids. Otherwise she needs to accept different strokes for different folks.", "NTA. You're giving your son a great opportunity and he's happy. That's all that matters. \n\"Kids of faculty get in free. Your daughter will be first for enrollment\" does not in any way imply your ex's daughter would be free too.", "NTA", "NTA. I lost out on SO MANY opportunities because my mother insisted my brother and I both had to do them. I wanted to go to science summer camp, but my brother failed the IQ test so I had to go to the regular camp where I was horrendously bullied by a camp counselor.\n\nI've never forgiven her for that or so many other missed opportunities.\n\nDo what's right by your son, keep him in the good school. He'll thank you for it later.", "NTA - you\u2019re doing what\u2019s right for your son. And ensuring he has an opportunity to do well in life", "A soft YTA because you knew that if you were upfront with everything that she would say no.  You were hoping she would make a bad assumption and she did and now you don't feel bad for sticking it to her.\n\nWhy didn't you try to negotiate some other way?  Are the public schools that much worse?  Maybe offer to do all the school drop offs or pitch in a lil $ with that free tuition for you?  Transportation for two kids is a big deal and you may not feel bad becuse your kid > ex's kid, but still it's a negative effect on the household to either split and drive mre or spend all that $.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know people are saying the ex is selfish for leveling down the school, but we don't even know the relative schools and their actual performance.  Also, a priave school with kids from parents who can afford to pay tuition will have very different demographics and the demographics drive a lot of school ranking.  It may not actually be a worse education.  Now, that said, private schools do offer \"Networks\" which have value so I know why the OP wants to get their kid there.   Just taht soft YTA for how they went about it.", "\nI have 3 kids, 3 different schools. We manage transportation and kids are thriving.\n\nYour ex is selfish for even considering to level-down your son to even out the field between her children. \n\nI would consider talking to a lawyer because your ex obviously doesn\u2019t have your son\u2019s best interest in mind and is favoring her daughter.

At least where  I'm from private schools have little to no standards to be held to. I've literally seen private schools teach creationism *instead* of evolution and that's just preparing your kid to be set back in life.", "Wait, that\u2019s different.   Was that your sister or half sister?  If full sister than how could your mom justify sending one kid but not the other?", "I think you're spot on in your assessment. I also don't think OP is wrong. Taking advantage of an opportunity for his son is exactly what he should do. I wouldn't want animosity between my kids and their hypothetical half siblings, but ultimately, I would do what I thought was best for my kids.", "Well, the father works at the school so presumably he\u2019s driving there every day anyway and can pick up the son on the way.", "I'm with you on this take. OP definitely manipulated the situation a bit to get his way, even if it was the right thing. The mother definitely should have thought through the decision to enroll her daughter better before making a move.  This doesn't say much for their co-parenting dynamic going forward.", "There's no way in hell any intelligent person would assume a child not at all related to him would get the free ride.", "I mean, dad works at the school so presumably he can just pick up the son?", "> It also doesn't sound as if the daughter has any interest in private school\n\nI didnt when either when I was a kid. I was wrong and my parents were right to send me anyways.", "Where I'm from it's the opposite: public schools are *crap* so anyone who can afford it goes to Catholic school, where we had a fantastic scientific education. It just came with a heaping helping of moralizing is all.", "For the exact same reasons people justify mom sending one kid and not the other in this thread?", "I would say that the scholarship is justification for sending the child who earned it. \n\nIt would be a different story if the mother worked at a private school that gave faculty free tuition for one child, regardless of family size.", "This isn\u2019t all worked out already? I mean, you said he started and is settled in with friends\u2026..", "Excellent.  I'd be planning on that being your new reality.  After awhile, you can argue for more custody.", "it's naive of her to assume that, but if she had expressed to OP in some way that she thought it was free and OP knowingly didn't correct her, i think that would make him an AH ngl", "Yeah idk why that didn\u2019t occur to me lol. That being said teachers do not work the same hours as students, they are usually there long before and after.", "Public schools are good where I'm from. Private schools are mostly religious hellholes in my city.", "A better question is \u2018did she ask?\u2019 \n\nOp might\u2019ve not been forthcoming, but he is not responsible for her other kid\u2019s tuition and that is a ridiculous thing to just assume.", "They would assume it's free for the daughter because OP suggested it knowing the ex was broke.\n\nOP is the only one in this story who has all the information: they know about the ins and outs of the school's financial aid system, and they know about the ins and outs of their ex's finances.\n\nSo, if the one person with all the information says, \"oh, this would be a good idea,\" then anyone listening assumes that it's, you know, a good idea.\n\nThat's why the ex is so pissed off, for the record. She trusted OP's experience and knowledge to steer her in the right direction and belatedly found out that OP just couldn't give two shits.", "If she cant afford it, thats a pretty damn good reason not to send her kids there.", " Tuition was the first thing to come to my mind, it should\u2019ve been for her as well", "Listen enrollment is different from tuition I have two kids in private school. You pay for enrollment and tuition. lol. Being able to enroll is simply being able to get first dibs bc your sibling is there. Not free tuition. Infact they give a discount for siblings but it's like 1-2% at my kids school. That's one of the reasons I started working there was for free tuition.", "Agreed. Literally every private school I know of has the clause that \"siblings of current students get priority for enrollemnt\" but that certainly doesn't mean that you are getting a 2 for 1 deal. Of COURSE you pay tuition for both children.\n\nYou are paying tuition for your son by providing labor for a below market rate to the private school. Your son's mother is not providing labor to the school. If she wants to get a job there to get free tuition she certainly can.\n\nNTA", "OP knows that the ex can't afford the school.\n\nSo, yes, when OP brought up the school as a possibility, that was misleading. \n\nOP said, \"oh, it's fine, just send your daughter to the school, too.\" They said this knowing that the ex was broke.\n\nSo, the ex made the pretty reasonable assumption that OP didn't expect her to pull a bag of shiny gold doubloons out of her ass, and that, therefore, suggesting the school meant suggesting that someone would help her to pay for it.\n\nIf OP hadn't said anything, then yes, it would be obvious that she had to pay herself. But OP DID say something, and what they said was \"you should send your daughter to the school.\" \n\nWhich implies that doing that is a possibility, because why would OP suggest something that they know damn well isn't possible?", "This is completely untrue.  I\u2019ve been a teacher for 15 years and schools, private and public, are NOT easy going about stuff.  I worked for a private school that gave free tuition to children of staff members (Yay) but teachers got no accommodation for before/after school care and had to pay for extended care.  Children could not be in their office or classroom during off hours.  They made it hard to get subs to see their children\u2019s activities or even do parent meetings.  Every school I\u2019ve worked at has made it hard for parents with sick kids or kids on a different schedule.  You\u2019d think schools would be flexible for staff but lol", "Daughter is not OP\u2019s concern and mother seeks to take opportunity away.\n\nThat is not in sons best interest.", "How did gender even enter into this? I\u2019m sure dad would still have sent his kid to the private school if he\u2019d been a girl."]}
