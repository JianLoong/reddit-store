Now his mother wants to selfishly deny him those opportunities because of her daughter?! How is that fair?! He\u2019s your son, her daughter is her responsibility! So what\u2019s going to happen in the future if you set up a college fund for your son, is she going to be that parent on Reddit requesting the fund to be divided between her kids?!

My mother wouldn't let me go because she couldn't afford to send my sister.  Instead I got a poor education in schools where I was bullied and mistreated by the staff and I lost the chance at a good education and the opportunities it would have provided.

She was clueless if she assumed tuition at a private school wasn't going to be a thing. Unless you actually told her that her daughter's tuition would be free, then there's no reason to assume she wouldn't have to pay. According to one of your comments, you'd be willing to drive him if it's ever an issue for her, so I see no real problems, other than her not getting her way (which is her problem). Of course you want your kid to have the best education and opportunities possible and I kinda have to wonder about her not wanting that too.

You essentially tricked her into approving the private school, and now you're refusing to approve the switch back. This isn't a referendum on private vs public school, this is about you being deceptive to get this done.\n\nYou surely knew she would have to pay tuition for her daughter to attend. You apparently led her to believe you were pulling strings to get her daughter the same \"deal\" as your son.  I agree she should want the best for your son even if it's inconvenient, but you went about this the wrong way.", "YTA and it has nothing to do with which school your kid goes to.

I'm not a parent so I'm not sure about the costs of education for public school vs. private school,  but I'm assuming that the son's education being paid for by the school will free up the mother's finances to provide more for her daughter (tutors, after school programs, etc).

Your son't best interest is served by considering that, and working with his mother to help reduce the upcoming resentment, envy, jealousy, etc that may be the result of this decision. Working to mitigate those effects on your son's relationship with his sister doesn't necessarily require you to provide anything financially - I don't want you to read this as a suggestion that you pay her tuition. There are lots of ways that parents can work to help their kids through difficult situations and this is going to be an ongoing difficult situation.", "ESH - yes it was a dumb thing to assume tuition would also be free for her, but the fact that you didn\u2019t clarify that feels manipulative.\n\nAnd yes, while it might not change your desire to have your kid in a better school, this could potentially cause major friction between the children \n\nAnd finally \u201c15 minutes between schools\u201d is unlikely to mean \u201conly 15 minute increase in your ex\u2019s commute\u201d and even that adds up - you should be proactively take responsibility for getting your kid to his school especially if you are the one who really wants him there.", "NTA for wanting your son to have this opportunity.

We both turned out fine and never once bickered about it.. if anything, it was cool that we both felt involved with social groups from two different high schools. I\u2019m smart in my own ways and he is smart in his own way and neither of us resented each other though I was a little jealous of his experience and he was jealous of mine! (He wanted to go to a big high school and have those traditional experiences).. but we were far too young to even think about the worries your ex has. I graduated a year early and went straight to school while my brother never went to college but started his own business that he still has and is killing it! My point is, we learned early that life is unfair and that circumstances are different for everybody and how to play up to our own strengths.

Kids have to be at school by a set time (like 8:30), so having to drop one and then drive 15-20 mins means she may have to pay for before or after school care, plus it has carry on effects like the feasibility of after school activities and impacts her working hours (that\u2019s 30-40 mins return drive on both ends, an hour to nearly an hour and a half extra driving per school day).

On the contrary I would assume that the ex is getting money from the daughters father or is currently married to him and so might have 2 incomes.", "OP isn't the only one who has all the information. It's common knowledge that you pay for private school, and OP never at any point said that it would be free for her daughter. He said the daughter would be put to the top of the additions list and the mother incorrectly assumed without checking without checking with the guy who has all the information, that it would be free despite no indication of such.", "> If he works at the school he can likely take the kid with him and has schoolday hours.\n\nCompletely untrue, he starts much earlier than children's classes and finishes much later. Especially if it's a private school.\n\n> Schools tend to be extremely kid-friendly workplaces.\n\n**Bunch of bollocks.** In fact schools are actually quite parent unfriendly. They are always understaffed and have incredibly strict educational criteria to meet. A teacher being late or not showing up is a huge deal and has a massive impact. You're confusing the fact that most school staff works during the school year with being kid friendly", "He works at the high school though, kid is attending a younger school. Typically high schools start much earlier than elementary or middle schools.", "u/Elctronne350 is a comment stealing bot. Original by u/ShadeSwornHydra", "I don\u2019t blame him AT ALL for not undermining his own argument. \n\nTuition should have been the next question from any reasonable adult like you said. \n\nClearly she is unreasonable for trying to take opportunities away from her son", "I didn\u2019t say that daughter was OPs concern, but it\u2019s reasonable from the most gets perspective if she can\u2019t afford it and can\u2019t take her kids to two different schools. It\u2019s not taking an opportunity away if she physically and financially can\u2019t provide it.", "She is taking opportunity away from son to be fair to daughter. \n\nSon should not be punished because of her other kid\u2019s situation.", "This is the same premise as if the son was offered a scholarship at that same school so got to go for free, and the daughter was not.", "Yeah, and heaps of parents don't send their kid in that situation because they cant manage two seperate school drop offs and still afford to feed the kids.", "OP however has said that if the mother was unable to do both drop offs, he would do it for his son, so it's not a problem."]}
