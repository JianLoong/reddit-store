She thought it would make things difficult since she also has a daughter who will be starting school next year. Our child custody agreement has a part where we cannot change our son's education without both of us agreeing. So my son couldn't go unless her mother said yes. \n\nSince the main issue she had was her daughter not being able to attend next year I told my ex about the school's policy that siblings of current students have priority on the admission list.

That's when she found out that while her daughter would get priority admission she would have to pay tuition. The school does offer scholarships, but they're more for exceptional or diverse students so her daughter is way down on the list.\n\nMy son's mother is now very upset by this and thinks I tricked her even though it was obvious her kid wouldn't get in for free since she's not my kid.

Common sense says that your sons half sister won\u2019t get in free because she\u2019s not your child. You are doing right by your child, and you are doing more for the half sister than you need to. You didn\u2019t need to tell her about the admission benefit.", "NTA she would rather both kids have a worse education than one kid have a better education. Nonsense. You need to do the heavy lifting of getting him to school, though. This is your priority, so being his daily taxi service is on you.", "Info: were you under the impression your ex knew she would have to pay her daughters tuition?", " NTA.  Yes going to a private school could be one area of advancement not open to her daughter but that doesn\u2019t guarantee anything.   I know p,entry of public school kids who have out careered their private school.   Unless you were deceptive in the fact that she would be on the hook for tuition no issues", "NTA your kid is your priority and she shouldn\u2019t hold back one kid just because it makes things easier for her to deal with her other kid. Different parents mean different opportunities", "NTA! \nAt the end of the day this is a good opportunity for your son! Now his mother wants to selfishly deny him those opportunities because of her daughter?! How is that fair?! He\u2019s your son, her daughter is her responsibility! So what\u2019s going to happen in the future is you set up a college fund for your son, is she going to be that parent on Reddit requesting the fund to be divided between her kids?! Crazy to me how a lot are saying YTA when your ex is clearly wiling to hold your son from better opportunities.", "NTA it was up to her to research what it would take to get her daughter into a private school. \n\nAs for everyone saying the son will have different opportunities  the the sister will unfortunately when it comes to half-siblings that is life they are deal with. Op can\u2019t hold back giving or doing something better for his son because the mother can\u2019t afford to do it for the sister. That isn\u2019t fair to the son or op.\n\nFor instance if op wants to take son on a Disney vacation mom can\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t say no because halfsister  can\u2019t go and mom can\u2019t afford to take her.", "Nta.  I'm sure you assumed she knew she'd have to pay", "Info: will it even be physically possible for her to get both kids off to school with them in 2 different schools? My sons go to different schools and with the start times it REQUIRES my husband to handle one and myself to handle the other as far as transportation. Also if she has a job does it impact her ability to get there on time?", "NTA.  When I was in grade school I had an opportunity to go to a very good private school on scholarship.  My mother wouldn't let me go because she couldn't afford to send my sister.  Instead I got a poor education in schools where I was bullied and mistreated by the staff and I lost the chance at a good education and the opportunities it would have provided.  I'm still salty about it almost 40 years later.\n\nPlease don't punish your son out of some twisted idea of equality.", "NTA, You\u2019re doing right by your son. Too bad if the ex has a beef with it. Her, issues are petty. Come on, she\u2019s going to punish the son for this?", "NTA. This seems to be what's best for your son. She was clueless if she assumed tuition at a private school wasn't going to be a thing. Unless you actually told her that her daughter's tuition would be free, then there's no reason to assume she wouldn't have to pay. According to one of your comments, you'd be willing to drive him if it's ever an issue for her, so I see no real problems, other than her not getting her way (which is her problem). Of course you want your kid to have the best education and opportunities possible and I kinda have to wonder about her not wanting that too. Kids with different parents can't expect everything to be equal and the same. This time it goes in your son's favor, but I'm sure there will be times it will go in her daughter's favor too.", "YTA. Not for wanting the best for your son, I fully agree on that and would say NTA if that was it. But from your comment below, it seems you weren't forthcoming about the cost the ex would have to pay for her kid to go there; seems intentionally misleading", "YTA, and frankly I cannot believe all the people who are trying to say that what you did was okay. \n\nYou knew she wouldn't be able to afford tuition, and deliberately misled her, and withheld information in order to manipulate the situation to get your way when your kid's mother expressed extremely valid concerns about the disparity between her two children. \n\nYou intentionally misrepresented the information in order to trick her into a position where she wouldn't be able change anything once you got your way.\n\nSo yeah 100% you are.", "YTA. If you can only afford to send your son to the school if you got free tuition, what made you think she could afford it? \n\nI\u2019m not saying you intentionally misled her, but clearly she wouldn\u2019t have agreed if a tuition waiver wasn\u2019t involved. \n\nI appreciate your desire for your son to get the best education possible. If I were you, I\u2019d see what the school can do for reducing tuition for her.", "YTA. You essentially tricked her into approving the private school, and now you're refusing to approve the switch back. This isn't a referendum on private vs public school, this is about you being deceptive to get this done.\n\nYou surely knew she would have to pay tuition for her daughter to attend. You apparently led her to believe you were pulling strings to get her daughter the same \"deal\" as your son.  I agree she should want the best for your son even if it's inconvenient, but you went about this the wrong way.", "YTA and it has nothing to do with which school your kid goes to.   You are supposed to co-parent kids, not mislead each other.  Is the better school really worth the fact, your co-parent knows you cant be trusted and wont work with you on anything else, quite possibly for years.  Hope you are happy with your \"win\"", "YTA\n\nYou set up a bait & switch by not giving her the details of how her daughter's enrollment would actually work.", "YTA\u2026.. you pretty much admit in the comments she wasn\u2019t willing to work with you so you did what was necessary to get her to agree. I understand that it\u2019s not your daughter but that is your sons sibling and his mother. When she manipulates you to get what she wants at some point I hope you remember this and realize just how much it sucks.", "YTA you tricked her into agreeing to let you son into that expensive school. You\u2019re manipulated and mislead her", "YTA for misleading her into thinking her daughter to attend.

Throwing her under the bus to try and defend your behavior makes YTA too.", "How is it on OP to make sure she\u2019s aware she has to pay tuition at a private school? Is that not incredibly obvious?", "It's not preferential treatment, it's reality. She has two kids from different parents, that by itself will change each of their lives in ways that are not comparable. Just because one of the fathers can provide a better future for his child, doesn't mean she gets to ruin it just so her other child doesn't feel jealous. OP said in one comment that he would be willing to drive his son to school. \n\nRaising kids is not about equality, it's about equity, and if that's not something you know, maybe having children isn't the best option for you either huh\n\nHer son has a great opportunity in front of him, and it's sad her daughter can't access it too, but the truth is that her son is not a consolation doll for her daughter. \n\nAlso a harsh reality is just that probably she doesn't want to put in the work of communicating and creating an environment where both her children understand they have different things and that that's okay. She doesn't want to deal with her daughter getting jealous and her having to teach her that while her feelings are valid, it's not her son's fault and that having different opportunities is not a bad thing, she probably has access to things her brother won't, and if not, at some point she will and she should not feel guilty or pressured to give that up just to make someone else feel better.", "This isn't equity, this is preferential. The reality is that her son is already at an advantage over her daughter by the simple fact of the social inequities between men, and women, and the access to opportunities they get in our society. Equity was her trying to make sure that her daughter was receiving access to the same educational opportunities as her son. \n\nThe father D E L I B E R A T E L Y misled, and withheld information from the mother in order to manipulate her. It doesn't matter how many times you try to argue, that fact alone makes him 100% the AH. Period.", "How is it preferential? It would be preferential if the daughter was also his and he only chose to send his son to private school. However, the daughter isn\u2019t his and she is not his responsibility. \n\nAlso, would you be saying the same thing if both were daughters?

It isn't fair to your child to make him have less because you are receiving the benefit of your employment at the school. \n\nI don't see that she was deceived at all. Where I am located, admission to a really good private school is competitive so there is an advantage to being granted preferential admission. Nothing you said had anything to do with tuition costs. No one could possibly think that tuition would be free for a child completely unrelated to an employee.\n\nThe only compromise you might make is that you would agree to take care of logistics of getting your child to school in the event that taking two kids separately was difficult for her to do.\n\nI can't imagine a judge ordering OP to withdraw the child from school where he is happy and receiving the benefit of a superior education because the ex's child can't afford to go. \n\nWhat would be different if OP were wealthier and could afford to give his bio child more benefits including affording tuition as well as after school classes, trips etc.", "NTA\n\nIt's your job to do what's best for your son's future.

Don't hold your son back because of her daughter.", "NTA.  You are doing what's best for your son. Your son's mother is making a lot of assumptions about what \"may\" happen with her daughter. For all ya'll know, the daughter won't give one flying rat's ass about where her brother goes to school.  I think this is really about the transport issue.  Mom doesn't want to have to add more time to her commute on her custody time by driving son to a different school further away.

She will have no obligations to any other kids you have with someone else.  If there are now 'inequalities' between kids then that is the price you pay for having multiple kids with different partners.   \n\nDenying your son the private school because she wants to 'equalise' her kids will only lead to resentment later on when he realises that is what happened.  Not being able to afford it may cause her daughter to be resentful, albeit for a reason that is easier to swallow - knowing your parents can't afford something is one thing, knowing that one of your parents let you have a lesser deal because they wanted their other kid to be 'equal' is a whole different kind of resentment - not only to his mother, but to the sister as well.\n\nOne of the kids is probably going to be resentful about this one day, and she has to figure out how to deal with that.", "Keep your son out of the government schools at all costs;  they are like small penitentiaries.\n\n**Edit:**  I see those downvotes...probably from government school teachers.

Are there busses?", "NTA\n\nAnd, I might add that for both children to fully enjoy school, it seldom truly benefits THEM to have their half-sibling at the same school unless they are exceptionally close. And your son being the eldest, there (most likely) will be an additional burden to him. Especially when he starts driving.", "ABSOLUTELY do NOT allow your son to be switched back to a public school. Your ex-wife's issues w/her new family are not your problem. It's your responsibility to provide the best education you can for your son, you had an awesome opportunity to do that, and because of your ex's miscalculation re: tuition, you got her to agree to allow him to take advantage of a private school education for free. If you allow your son to leave the private school to please your wife, you will never have another opportunity to give him this enormous advantage.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe she is going to rob her son of such a great opportunity for the sake of another child. This is highly selfish of her.

He will resent both of you if you do this.", "Yta a little, I mean it sounds like u purposely made it vague sounding so she would agree", "Agreed. I understand the mother's worry about jealousy because that does sometimes happen, but the son shouldn't pay for it. It also doesn't sound as if the daughter has any interest in private school (not every kid does, I wouldn't have wanted to go to private school as a kid) so the slighted feelings seem to be entirely the mother's. \n\nAnd the son going to private school doesn't take anything away from the daughter. I'm not a parent so I'm not sure about the costs of education for public school vs. private school,  but I'm assuming that the son's education being paid for by the school will free up the mother's finances to provide more for her daughter (tutors, after school programs, etc). Any parents here feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.", "Well yes, but it sounds alike that is what the mom was getting at and the father purposefully worded it to make it vague but open to it might be free.", "This is the one!

OP is clearly NTA.", "People are bonkers! Of course he is TA.", "Well, if the mom had known she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford tuition, she wouldn\u2019t have agreed to move schools.

His job is to provide for his son.  The argument that son will have more opportunities is seriously flawed.  Would you want any of your children to have fewer opportunities!!?", "Mom could offer op full custody if she is worried about household inequity.  That seems more reasonable than denying a child educational opportunity."]}
