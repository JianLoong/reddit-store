It\u2019s nice that your hard work has paid off but your response is tacky.", "In general, it's pretty obnoxious when people talk about how much money they have. It's tasteless.\nGood on you for putting in the work to get to a good place in your career, but please don't get a massive head over the pay check.\nESH", "Soft yta. I like that last line though. It\u2019s one of those read the room situation. I don\u2019t show off in front of people who have less or are not in a position to celebrate my accomplishments. I learned that lesson the hard way when my ex friend told people people I only use my degree to \u2018get attention\u2019. She has no degree", "ESH. It\u2019s your money and you alone get to determine how you spend it. That being said, showing off your wealth is going to get very old with your friends and family very quickly.", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with enjoying creature comforts as your finances permit. But the general rule is that if you have to describe a comment as a \"joke,\" you're probably attempting to justify assholish behavior to yourself and others. Just so in this case. Saying \u201cI can\u2019t help it if my money speaks for itself ; my money talks my money gets annoying \u201c is not a joke. It's rubbing your relative wealth in a poorer relation's face. There is absolutely no need for it. Go apologize to your sister.", "You could have really phrased that better. Sigh. \n\nSure, its your money, and you have the right to use it as you see fit, but please make sure it does change who you are. Your sister needs to work on her career advancement, not blame you for having one.", "you bought a $250K car and just sent it to the family group chat? lol \n\nyou come off as immature and obnoxious, honestly.

This wasn't the low road, it just wasn't the highest road either of you could've taken.", "ESH . It's pretty clear that your sister ISN'T happy with her salary or she wouldn't be saying shit like this. She's out of line, but you're also completely disregarding her feelings. Like, hard. I don't know how you can possibly say \"she's out here struggling\" and \"she's happy so why does salary even matter\" in the same post.", "ESH. My brother and his wife make roughly 100 times what I do in a year. Doesn\u2019t bother me at all: I made my choices and they made theirs. And it\u2019s nice to know that someone close can easily help me out in an emergency (it hasn\u2019t happened yet). \n\nOn the other hand, you shouldn\u2019t be flippant about it. It\u2019s obnoxious.", "YTA. Good for you for working hard and making money. However, you made a joke in poor taste AFTER your sister said she was struggling. Instead on being empathetic, you decided to be an AH about it. A friend said to me not long ago that a quick way to lose friends is to get rich, but making the money is one thing and keeping egos in check is another. You care about your sister, right?", "YTA \n\nNot for living lavishly, that's something you've earned. But for your last comment. If you know you live a drastically different lifestyle than those you love tone it down around them. \n\nI was at a dinner the other week and met a new person one of my friends brought. She was very lovely, super down to earth. We ended up exchanging Instagrams where I learned she's also a millionaire with multiple homes. \n\nWouldn't have had any idea by her conduct or the way she was dressed or what she ordered - and it made me respect the hell out of her.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA be careful, your head might get too big for your shoulders if you don't tone it down a bit.", "YTA. I mean yeah, that's the definition of insufferable asshole. It's good that you at least have money, because with this personality you really don't have much going on for you.", "ESH. She's jealous and your comment was uncalled for.", "ESH She should be happy for you not jealous, but you don't need to rub it in either with your whole my money talks comment. That was just rude!", "I think nobody really cares but humility never hurts.", "INFO: Did you ask them to help find a place to live or did they offer?", "You\u2019re not the AH for making a lot more money. You obviously earned it. But you spoke like a snotty brat to your sister which is how she already sees you anyway. Think before you speak. Soft YTA", "ESH. Talk to your sister and figure out a way for you two to coexist in peace.", "NTA, but the jealousy about money on this sub is out of control so good luck.", "YTA, for flaunting it. Why send that picture to the family group chat? \n\nAlso, did you seriously watch *The Social Network* and think that it was a training film?", "Def, ESH that being said you could tell her to get some skills beyond just being a cashier and people would pay her the actual worth she should be paid as a human being. Being a receptionist is ultimately what she's choosing and what she is limiting herself to.", "NTA for living however you want, the \"my money talks\" comment was unnecessary tho and a bit rude but she's the one complaining over nothing", "NTA - you\u2019ve worked hard and earned what you\u2019ve earned. You are absolutely free to spend your money on whatever you want. In this case the other folks asked your budget. WTF are you supposed to do? Lie? Tell them a lower figure so as not to hurt your sister\u2019s feelings? This is ridiculous. You are absolutely not responsible for her being butt hurt.", "YTA. And stop sending pictures of your overpriced stuff you are wasting money on in the group chat.  (And i bet you\u2019ve posted it on social media too)", "Nta\n\nShe\u2019s very jealous instead of being proud of you. I understand being envious of you, but it\u2019s making her ugly. Maybe going forward don\u2019t include her on any big purchases you make.", "Nobody likes a braggart, if it was just that I\u2019d have a different judgement. You doubled down, so\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nI'm not sure why people are calling you an asshole and saying that \"always showing off\".. When you made one joke. \n\nYou worked hard for your money.. You're showing off your hard work. \n\nYour sister is jealous and while that's understandable, she cannot expect you to keep your money in your pocket and never spend it because \" she doesn't have the same money\"\n\nIf she wants more money, then she needs to find a job that pays better.. You cant complain about something that you chose yourself.", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't out there trying to hurt anybody's feelings and have zero control over how they choose to feel. They could choose to feel happy for you, that you worked so hard grinding for this. Or they could choose to be jealous. Those are their feelings to have and not anything you are doing to them intentionally. You did make a snarky comment, but it's a true comment and you only said it after what your sister said. Your money does speak for itself. You can afford higher quality items because you have the money, and because you *earned it.*", "NTA You don't need to hide that you're well off just because other people might be jealous and butthurt. There is no reason for you to live in a small crappy apartment if your budget allows you to buy or rent a better place. You're also not showing it off, you're just sharing your life with your family, that's a pretty normal thing to do. It's also completely okay to be proud of something, such as buying a nice car. Men have entire instagram accounts for their stupid race cars, put them in their profile pictures and their dating profiles, so I really don't see how you sending a picture to the FAMILY GROUPCHAT is such a big deal. I don't know how you generally act or how relevant the designer clothes are, but based on the car picture and apartment you're really not obnoxious or showing off.", "Yta for your comment", "NTA,\n\nThey asked, you answered.", "NTA. I\u2019m disabled and being in very little, my brother makes top 1% salary in the uk. I wouldn\u2019t dream of treating him this way. Sure it\u2019s annoying occasionally, but that\u2019s my limitation, not his problem.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds jealous about your success.", "NTA. Making one bad joke doesn't mean you're showing off.", "NTA but I would keep your family out of what you do in these areas. Do not ask for help in acquiring whatever from them.  \n\nYou worked for this. Enjoy it. Perhaps what your sister is doing is the best she can do for whatever reason.", "NTA.  But kinda.\n\nCongrats on your success.  Your family should be happy for you.  But the \u201cmy money speaks for itself\u201d comment was pretty insensitive.  Apologize to your sister, keep enjoying your life and don\u2019t be obnoxious.  If after that your sister still can\u2019t handle the situation, that\u2019s on her.", "You\u2019re an asshole for buying a $300,000 Lamborghini at 24. I\u2019ve got some adult advice for you: life comes at you quickly. Your situation can change overnight and all that you\u2019re going to have to console your feelings is a status symbol.", "NTA", "I don't want to say one way or the other, largely because I'd hate to think that my situation makes me an AH lol. I have a younger brother who has never held down a job, never finished high school, and exists by leeching off of my mother. If my twin brother or I discuss much about our lives he thinks we're being \"in your face\" about it. Keep in mind that we both went to college and gained marketable skills to get to even a modest middle class level. I have to walk on eggshells around the younger brother, and I usually find that there's nothing to talk about because he's looking for reasons to be offended. I don't know whether or not this is a pattern with your sister.\n\nI have no idea why your sister was on the call unless she offered to help, or perhaps your parents pulled her into the fray? If she volunteered, she would have to have known that your job would give you a larger budget. That's on her. But your comment was not particularly graceful and pushes it toward AH territory. Also, it's one thing to say that you got a new car, since your family would know about it eventually and it factors into your housing budget. But was it necessary to mention the clothes? That seems like a flex.\n\nESH, possibly leaning toward YTA?", "YTA. You watched The Social Network and your takeaway from that was \"I want to be just like those people\"? That's so weird.\n\nLearn how to act classy and be classy. That means not being an AH to your family and flaunting your good fortune.\n\nAlso, you're new to the tech industry, so, as an older person who's been through the ups and downs: Shit might not be this good forever. Save as much as you can. Live far below your means. Sometimes things are good, sometimes things are not. You are not immune to market forces and just because you're a 20-something making what you perceive to be a crapton of money right now does not mean it's going to be like that forever. Sometimes you get lucky with a job and stock bonuses, and sometimes you're taking whatever crap contract work you can find. \n\nAnd from experience- flashy cars are great at showing managers who doesn't need a raise and who won't be too disadvantaged when it comes time for layoffs.", "Nta, those are the benefits that come with hard work and dedication", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
