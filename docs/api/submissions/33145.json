Backstory: my daughter and her husband came to stay with us almost 5 yrs ago. It was to be a temporary living situation, but due to monetary complications on their end it turned out to be longer. My daughter has three children (8), (4), (2), and just recently lost her husband to a senseless crime. Neither had life insurance, but that has nothing to do with my decision. I have 4 other children that live with me (19), (17), (10), and (6); and due to the hardship my daughter is having, we have all shifted to accommodate my eldest daughter and her family. \n\nBefore my son-in-law was taken from us I have to say my daughter and son-in-law were slobs. The main reason they came to stay with us in the first place was to keep from losing their children to the state. When they came to stay my wife and I along with my 4 other children basically became live in nannies while my eldest daughter and husband basically slept most of the day. When I say sleep I mean they would get home from work, sleep and wake in enough time to go to work. Their off days they would sleep in. I am retired and enjoy my grandkids. My wife and I did the morning routine for the school bus, homework, potty training for the two younger grands. It\u2019s been a lot, but families are to support each other. Along with being a \u201cnanny\u201d we became maids cleaning up after two grown folk so our house wouldn\u2019t become like their previous home. \n\nNow we already have 3 female cats, and 1 male dog. Neither one my eldest would scoop a litter box for, or walk. Sure she would provide food and litter, but that\u2019s the extent of her care for them. And this is where my denial to her request comes. My dog I rescued from her because she couldn\u2019t care for it, along with the two older cats I have. So would it really be smart of me to take on another animal?? I have no idea the needs of support animals, but wouldn\u2019t they require the same amount of attention that an (8), (4), and (2) yr old would need?? Or do support animals come with a care provider that I would need to make room for?? These are serious facetious questions with a hint of curiosity and sarcasm.\n\nI know my daughter grieves\u2026 I just really hope there are other ways to support her grief than adding another animal to me and my wife\u2019s already full plate.

She can pick one the existing animals in the house, some of which started out as hers, and use that one.  \n\nBut your main issue is the enabling that is going on in the household.
