My daughter has three children (8), (4), (2), and just recently lost her husband to a senseless crime. Neither had life insurance, but that has nothing to do with my decision.

The main reason they came to stay with us in the first place was to keep from losing their children to the state. When they came to stay my wife and I along with my 4 other children basically became live in nannies while my eldest daughter and husband basically slept most of the day. When I say sleep I mean they would get home from work, sleep and wake in enough time to go to work. Their off days they would sleep in. I am retired and enjoy my grandkids. My wife and I did the morning routine for the school bus, homework, potty training for the two younger grands. It\u2019s been a lot, but families are to support each other.

Neither one my eldest would scoop a litter box for, or walk. Sure she would provide food and litter, but that\u2019s the extent of her care for them. And this is where my denial to her request comes. My dog I rescued from her because she couldn\u2019t care for it, along with the two older cats I have. So would it really be smart of me to take on another animal?? I have no idea the needs of support animals, but wouldn\u2019t they require the same amount of attention that an (8), (4), and (2) yr old would need?? Or do support animals come with a care provider that I would need to make room for?? These are serious facetious questions with a hint of curiosity and sarcasm.\n\nI know my daughter grieves\u2026 I just really hope there are other ways to support her grief than adding another animal to me and my wife\u2019s already full plate.

OP, that is ***DISGUSTING!*** YOU'VE not ONLY enabled all of this, but now you've involved your younger children into picking up the slack of your incompetent daughter and her late husband.

Either your daughter is seriously mentally unwell or she's the laziest mooch ever with no drive for herself. Establish some boundaries and expectations of your daughter or cut her lose.

It's unfortunate she lost her husband and yes, everyone runs into money problems. But something tells me she's very irresponsible with every decision she makes. Who the F would get pregnant with more babies while living at home? YTA for enabling all of this to happen under your roof. She needs more than counseling and an emotional support dog.
