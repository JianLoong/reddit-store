The child didn't ask for this, and you should never have gotten back with your husband if you couldn't treat all his kids as your own. Treating him as a second class citizen who doesn't get to interact with his dads family is only punishing him for his dad's decisions. It'd be fine if you stayed split up and only interacted with your ex when coparenting your daughter. But it is so not ok to choose to be his step parent by taking your husband back, and then to not treat him as your own. His dad's decisions don't give you a right to mistreat an innocent child especially when you could've just not let any of this dysfunction back into your life and stuck to coparenting your oldest.", "You never should have remarried him knowing he still had a link of any kind to the mistress.", "ESH.

The fact that you make your husband stay in a hotel with his son is fucked up as well. You are just being a complete asshole here.", "You are absolutely in the right.  You have zero obligation to this child.  He can take affair child and stay elsewhere.  He is a horses ass to try and guilt you.  Stick to your guns.

Otherwise you shouldn't be married to that child's father. \n\nConsider if you were in a relationship with someone who would not accept your child - would you continue hiding them like a dirty secret or do the responsible thing and break up?

You shouldn't have taken him back unless you were prepared to accept her as a family member. I hope he leaves you to prioritise his child.", "ESH. If the affair is still an issue, then you shouldn't be back together.", "ESH. This should have been resolved before you guys got back together again. The poor child isn't the criminal here. Your husband was. Why is the child who did no wrong punished for decades, but not your husband? Do you withhold your children from meeting with their sibling as well?", "YTA. You signed up for this again.  That means all of him including his kid.

Sure the circumstances hurt more but that's still your husband's kid.", "ESH. Mostly your husband who has allowed you to treat this child as a second class citizen.   He was very wrong to have an affair,  but it isn't the child's fault and your husband should not have gotten back together with you for the benefit of one child while having this other one be treated inferior. \n\nYou for your treatment of a child who is in no way at fault and if your couldn't accept the child you shouldn't have reconnected with the father", "Perhaps you should have dealt with your lingering resentment for the affair and child with your therapist.

You\u2019re toxic AF and you\u2019re \u201cpunishing\u201d the wrong person here.", "Yta you chose to get remarried knowing this kid exists.   Kid staying with dad is a completely reasonable and normal thing.", "YTA. You are being exactly what he said. You're blaming a CHILD who didn't ask to be here?

You should have stayed divorced.", "Yes, your husband has a child plain and simple.", "ESH\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. What you feel is reasonable, but you should try to work out your unresolved anger towards your partner's affair. \n\nThere's nothing you can do about the past, it isn't fair for the kid, it's not fair for you as a person either to have this thing hanging over your head everytime your partner see his child. It is not fair for your kid to be deprived from having a better relationship with her brother.\n\nThis little boy doesn't deserve to be alienated from his dad house because of his history, he didn't ask for any of this. You didn't either but you are in a position where you can change things,\n\nI hope everything turns out well.", "Yta\n\nYou got back together with him knowing he had another child. That child is a package deal with him. You can't take one without the other.", "YTA. You two should have stayed divorced if you couldn't forgive your husband for the affair and accept that the child is part of his life.  You're punishing a CHILD for your husband's behavior. Meanwhile you're back married to the man who cheated on you.\n\nMarriage counseling for you both and individual therapy for you.", "YTA\n\nYou got back with this man *knowing* that he was now a parent of a child conceived from an affair during your marriage. You knew that, and you reconciled with him anyway.  You have no right to interfere with his ability to care for his child.  He's absolutely right that the circumstances of the conception are not the child's fault.  The child should be welcome in his father's home, and if you can't deal with that, you shouldn't have gotten back with the child's father.", "Maybe the biggest TA of all time.  \nSeriously, I think this is the most shocking post on Reddit to date.  \nThe other stepmom who didn't want her stepson living with her had bad arguments, but at least she took care of the kid and accepted him being there every weekend.  \n\n\n  \nThis woman said she can't even look at the child. She hates a child she doesn't even know. You've got to be a truly awful person to act like that.  \n\n\n  \nIf the boy's mother passes away, where will he live? This is utterly insane.", "YTA. Normally, I feel that you should not need to be exposed to an affair child. However, you remarried him after years apart, knowing that the child was there and that he was actively part of the child's life. Remarrying him changes you from being the spouse who he hurt to being the cruel stepmother. While I think your husband is an idiot for remarrying your under the condition that you do not have to accept his son, I think you are worse for having remarried him under that condition. If you cannot look at his son, you should have never gotten back together with him.", "YTA. You got back together with him knowing that he had another child. Either deal with it or break it off for good.", "This is a tricky one. \n\nI know a woman who\u2019s husband had an affair, which resulted in a child. She didn\u2019t leave him, but told him \u201cyou will pay her to take care of your daughter, whatever she needs, you can give it. Anything. But I do not want you to be apart of this child\u2019s life\u201d they are extremely wealthy btw, he owns a coal truck business on top of a few other businesses. BUT he also agreed to this and they never split. They had an agreement. \n\nI wasn\u2019t even sure about how I felt about her situation. But I can see your POV on this one. Especially if you\u2019ve never met the child to begin with (that\u2019s what I took away from your post) \n\nI really can\u2019t give an answer here for you and I\u2019m sorry. I DO think it\u2019s a little unfair that he\u2019s springing this on you out of nowhere, because you had an agreement that his weekends would be spent in a hotel room, away from you. If it hurts you or bothers you too much, then I\u2019d ask him to do an extended stay at a hotel. YOUR mental health is important here too and the child should not be your responsibility.", "ESH. Maybe, just maybe, you two were better off divorced. This is an issue that is not going away.", "NTA. Your husband needs to find out exactly how long she will be away and make arrangements. An affair child is not the same as a stepchild as I'm sure he knows. \n\nAnd of course it is not the child's fault but this situation will only get worse as the child grows up and realizes what is going on. There have to be arrangements in place for extended periods, or AP just can't go.", "Yta.\n\nHe is the one that did you wrong and him alone.  You forgave the man that destroyed your trust and family and has done something that most people would not forgive him for.\n\nHowever the innocent child that has done nothing to hurt you that has not even did a single thing to even make you feel a little bit bad, gets limited time with his father because you decided to take him back?  Gross.\n\nNow the father.... what kind of man is with a woman that would ostracize any child to punish the child's parents, let alone do this to his own child?\n\nThere is nothing ok with this dynamic.  I guess you guys deserve each other but these poor children.  I say all of them because you are denying your own child time and quality bonding with a sibling for no reason other than you can no longer blame your ex for infidelity and you need somewhere to focus your hurt.", "ESH except for the kids.\nWhy would you forgive and marry your ex and treat a child like this? Is it because you heeded a dad for your other child?\nYour husband sucks for allowing his child to be treated this way.", "YTA he accepted your other child why can't you do the same?", "YOU took your husband back after he had an affair, YOU were aware he had a child and YOUR husband is an asshole for allowing you to treat his son like garbage......so yes YTA", "YTA - you decided to get back together with him, fully knowing he had an affair and a kid with the mistress.", "YTA. You reconciled with your husband KNOWING there was a child that was the result of an affair, if you weren\u2019t okay with that you should have stayed divorced. He\u2019s raising your child like his own and you are treating his child, who is an innocent in the whole situation, like a second class citizen. Your husband is correct and hopefully this opens his eyes to the type of person you are and goes back to the way things were before. I hope for the sake of your innocent child he is a better person than you and still treats that child as his own.", "Honestly, I can't find the words to say how sickening your behavior is.

The fact is, if you had, you would accept he had a child and has to be a father to him. That means you are a step mother. You married a man with a child, no matter how he came to have it. At that point it no longer mattered that it came from an affair. Just like you, he was a parent with a child. You made the choice to marry a man with a child, and that means you have to allow him to parent that child in your shared home without blowing a gasket or treating that child ill. YTA", "The real deal is that you didn't really forgive your husband for cheating. This kid did nothing to you. You need to grow up and forgive. And quit with the screaming.

If I were her I wouldn\u2019t want my kid around you just the same for fear of mistreatment etc. I know everyone is coming for you reading you for filth , but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re evil.

You should have never gotten back together with him if this is how you were going to treat his child. But yet you expect him to support your child who isn\u2019t his.

I don't know how old he is, but I'm sure he wonders why he needs to stay in a hotel while he's with his father. Last, your husband accepted your daughter as his own. He wasn't obligated to. Why doesn't the treatment extend back to his son? \n\nHonestly, you sound like you have a lot of personal issues. I'm surprised your husband remarried you if you treat his son the way you do.

So you can forgive your husband for cheating on you but not accept a child who did nothing to deserve your ire? This kid is innocent, and if you're going to ostracize and hurt him like this, you never should have gotten back together with your husband, although shame on him, too, for allowing you to treat his child like shit.

This does not mean OP is required to do favors for her husband\u2019s ex-mistress.", "I don\u2019t see why he has to be part of her life. She doesn\u2019t prevent her husband from being a father or having a relationship with his son. Why would she need to do any more than that?", "I guess I didn\u2019t make it clear. My dad is a bad person, for abandoning his child. I don\u2019t think his wife is a *bad* person but I wouldn\u2019t do what she did for a whole host of reasons. I wouldn\u2019t want to be with a bad person who abandons their child.", "Wow, not much sympathy here. Really, I was just pointing out the ridiculousness of the assumptions here.", "OP's feelings need to be dealt with, because this is not acceptable. It's  *their* house and it's not some jackass miscreant teenage friend of their kid who is banned from the house, it's his son. \n\nObviously the husband  shouldn't have cheated, but at least he's stepped up to the responsibility of being a father. Which she knew when she remarried him.", "Or, end of marriage. That\u2019s what I would suggest to both of them. \n\nFull disclosure: I am an \u201caffair baby\u201d (I don\u2019t typically call myself that but eh). I frankly think they are both the AH. Op for remarrying a man with a child she has issues with and husband for agreeing to treat his kid like a nobody.", "If you love your children, you consider them in every decision you make, especially a series of decisions like finding a private spot, taking off your clothes, forgoing birth control, putting your penis inside a vagina that isn't your wife's, ejaculating inside it, etc.\n\nThis wasn't a momentary lack in judgment, he didn't impulse buy a candy bar in the checkout aisle.  He fucked and knocked up his affair partner while his wife and daughter were oblivious at home.\n\nIt's evil.  It goes way beyond what I will chalk up to \"stupidity.\"  At a certain point, *aggressive disinterest in your own small child's future* really isn't distinguishable from \"malice.\"", "Yeah and you know what that means? He doesn\u2019t give a fuck about how his actions hurt his kids if he can\u2019t even think of them when doing something life altering.", "I dont even get what the counseling did. She is still obviously harboring contempt for him and his child.", "You don't rub your spouses nose in your affair. It makes a difference", "She\u2019s not \u2018doing a favor for her husband\u2019s ex-mistress.\u2019 She\u2019s enabling her husband to properly care for the child that he fathered. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t have to trust or even like this woman. She *does*, however, have to figure out how to accept the child\u2019s presence in her life. The fact that it\u2019s been literal years and she can\u2019t even acknowledge the child\u2019s existence is bullshit, sorry. If she wasn\u2019t prepared to love the child more than she hated AP, she shouldn\u2019t have gotten back together with her husband.", "The child\u2019s mother isn\u2019t relevant.", "She only lets him see the kid at a hotel, that is absolutely preventing him from properly being a father.", "Yeah I have no sympathy for people who put their kids in these types of situations.", "I don\u2019t see a reason she needs to be involved in the child\u2019s life at all. The kid has two parents and she isn\u2019t preventing her husband from being a father."]}
