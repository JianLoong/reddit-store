I do not have a lot of rules, but I expect the few I have to be followed because they are for both for safety and common courtesy. My (18M) oldest child has always had difficulty following rules. He is also extremely irresponsible and does not seem to understand how his actions affect others. \n\nWhen he does something wrong, he gets irrationally angry about it or tries to rationalize it. Any comment, even constructive criticism, is met with aggressive anger and name calling. By his own admission, he has anger issues, and he sees a therapist regularly. He even blows up at himself when he\u2019s alone in his room if he spills a drink or stubs his toe. It\u2019s completely over the top. \n\nNow that he\u2019s legally an adult, if we have a disagreement, he will immediately start yelling, name calling, and say that\u2019s he\u2019s an adult and I can\u2019t tell him what to do. He\u2019s made some poor decisions that have negatively impacted our family and does not seem to understand consequences at all. If this was any other relationship and not my child, I would have ended it long ago. I am sick of his blow ups and being called names in my own home. And I am sick of him doing whatever he wants with no regards to how his actions affect others. It causes a lot of unneeded stress.\n\nTonight I hit my breaking point. He went out and when he got home, he did not lock the door or even check to make sure it was latched. I heard him come in and called out to lock the door because I was in the back of the house at the time. He ignored me. The door was left wide open and one of our cats got out and is now missing.  \n\nThis is not the first time he\u2019s failed to close or lock a door. I have woken up twice in the last year to discover my front door wide open in the middle of the night. Luckily both those times our pets were secured in other rooms and did not get out. And thankfully no one came in. \n\nDue to his anger issues and the fact that he can\u2019t be trusted to do basic but important things like close a  door, I no longer feel safe with him here. I called his father tonight in tears, and he immediately came over and helped look for our cat. He spent hours combing the neighborhood with me and agrees that our son\u2019s behavior is not ok. \n\nOur son did help look for the cat, but he doesn\u2019t understand why I am so upset over a mistake. I told him a mistake that keeps happening is a choice and that he has no regard for our safety or how his actions affect others. \n\nFor the safety of me, my other children, and our pets, I asked his father to take him to stay at his house for now. Our son is mad at me for doing it, but I need a break from him. I am heartbroken our cat is still missing and worried about how my other children will react when we tell them, and I am so angry that it all could have been prevented.

His continued inability (unwillingness?) to take responsibility is very childish.  \nHe says he's an adult not? Fine, then take responsibility for your actions!\n\nI suggest you change the locks.", "NTA. He needs to do a lot more work on himself, and just because it was a mistake doesn't lessen the consequences of it. Imagine if the door hadn't been found and it was left open half the night, that's a massive security issue an eighteen year old should be able to understand.\n\nAs he's said to you, he's an adult and since he's an adult you're no longer obligated to have him under your roof. You're treating him as an adult based on his behaviour. Has he been diagnosed to explain this dissociation he's demonstrating?", "NTA. He's an adult who is deliberately endangering your family. He shows no remorse, and these clearly are not mistakes, as he does so again and again. \n\nI really hope your cat comes back.", "NTA.  His behavior is completely unacceptable.  If he wants to pull the, \"I'm an adult, you can't tell me what to do\" card, a reminder that you are not obligated to provide a roof over his head or food on the table for him is an important lesson for him.", "NTA- people forget that children can also be perpetrators of abuse against their parents. You deserve to feel safe in your own home and your children deserve to feel safe. It's not like you sent him out on the street, he is staying with his dad. I would just make sure that you tell him you love him a lot and always will, but that you feel it is in the best interest of everyone that he stays with his dad at the moment.", "NTA - your son is an adult and he\u2019s going to need to smell the roses and taste the consequences of his actions. You\u2019ve already done everything you can for him (trying to teach him, sending him to therapy, etc.) at a certain point and at a certain age, it\u2019s up to the person. \n\nAs for the cat, I\u2019ve heard sticking their litter box outside is a good way to attract it back! I hope you find it!", "NTA,\n\nIt might be worth him being evaluated for neurodivergence such as ADHA, Autistic PDA profile, or a Cluster B or C personality.", "NTA\n\nLike he said, he\u2019s an adult now. Adult mistake/s adult consequences. Kick his ass to the curb and change the locks.", "NTA. As he keeps reminding you, he is an adult now. There are consequences to our actions. You're not kicking him out on the street, he's going to live with his father where, hopefully, he can get a new perspective and some therapy.", "NTA - actions have consequences", "NTA. It\u2019s about time he faced consequences. I guarantee he\u2019ll be better behaved at his dads house.", "NTA, it's not like you threw him out on the streets. you asked his father to take him and stay at his house. \n\nhe needs to learn that his actions (or lack there off) have consequences. forgetting to lock the door is one thing but forgetting to even fully close it is outright stupid. \n\n\"he will immediately start yelling, name calling, and say that\u2019s he\u2019s an adult and I can\u2019t tell him what to do. \" doesn't sound like anything a responsible adult would do.", "If you put your cat\u2019s litter box outside, it might get your cat to come home", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you are going through that, I can\u2019t imagine the amount of anxiety it causes!", "NTA\n\nHe needs to learn to be an adult and take the responsibilities that come with that. You are not TA at all, you action is helping him down this path.", "Not at all.  I\u2019m so sorry he has these problems and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s in therapy.", "NTA\n\nHave you considered family therapy? Might help to have another person to validate your feelings in front of him.", "NTA. It's not just him leaving the door unlocked this time, it's that this incident combined with dozens or hundreds of others created a cumulative effect. You've done everything you could for your now-adult son, & it's not as if you're throwing him out on the street with nowhere to go; you specifically commended him to the care of his other parent. Your safety, & the safety of your other kids, matter a hell of a lot more than this particular son's bent feelings.", "NTA. You have an out of control son, who fails to take responsibility for his behavior, doesn't care about consequences, and is putting your safety and property at risk - repeatedly.  At 18, your 'power' over him is greatly diminished and short of kicking him out to the street, sending him to live with his father is nearly the only thing left in the tool kit. You did the right thing.", "NTA, but obligatory is your son being treated by a medical doctor or occupational therapist for executive function problems? \n\nFrom what you've said here he doesn't appear to be doing this stuff intentionally and it is not under his control. Specific help based on understanding of his challenges is likely to be needed.", "Doesn\u2019t matter that he is 18, everywhere you live there are rules to be followed. But since he claims to be an adult, let him pay rent, pay for his phone, internett, insurance etc. suddenly being an adult is less fun. \nTo close the door is something he should have learned when he was a kid.", "NTA. Your son needs therapy. He is actively endangering himself and others with this behaviour.", "NTA.  But. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t get into a debate about mistakes vs choices.  That isn\u2019t going to be productive.  What might be?  Therapy.\n\nYour son is exhibiting very poor emotional regulation.  It is evident in how he argues and in any personal challenges he faces (spilling a drink).  Simply telling him the consequences isn\u2019t going to drive change in his behavior.\n\nWhile he is an adult, and this is a pattern, and I would make the same choice you are, he also needs help.

Actions have consequences... And unfortunately the level of intent doesn't always align with the level of impact.", "NTA. Your son needed a wake-up call, and hopefully staying with his father isn't a punishment in itself? There is one little bell ringing here: Could your son have mental issues? Like eg ADHD? If he does, then he needs help.", "NTA. \n\nDon't take him back if you don't feel comfortable. Your safety matters.", "NTA. He is eighteen, and you sent him to live with his dad, not to live under a bridge. He\u2019s endangering your entire family and now his lack of impulse control and care has resulted in real damage.

Hope you find your cat ):", "NTA\n\n>he doesn\u2019t understand why I am so upset over a mistake.\n\nMistakes are unintentional and usually we don't make the same mistakes over and over.  You reminded him and he still didn't close and lock the door.  It's a pattern of behavior when the same mistakes are made over and over.  If you make the same mistake over and over and do not do anything to learn from the mistake, there's a certain level of unconscious intention in that.  \n\nHe clearly has not learned that even though mistakes happen, you have to fix your own mistakes and make amends for what you caused.  Even unintentional things harm others and you need to own that and make it right.", "NTA.\n\nIn his own words, he's an adult now, which means he has to face the consequences of his actions. The time for acting like a bratty teen is over, he needs to grow up.\n\nI am however curious as to how he turned out like this, people are more often than not products of their environment after all. As a young man who was raised by a single mother myself, I can tell you know, there ain't no way any of his bullshit would have flown under her roof.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants to be an adult then he needs to deal with the adult consequences of his actions. Namely, if you're an AH to your roommate, don't expect them to be your roommate very long. Honestly, sounds like the perfect time for him to learn what being an adult feels like.", "NTA.\nLike he's said, he's an adult.\nAs an adult he has to realise that, mistake or not, actions have consequences. \nThe consequence of his actions mean you are no longer willing to live with him - at least for now.\n\nI hope you find your cat soon and they're safe and unharmed.", "Nta. I smell borderline or adhd. Since my friend and fianc\u00e9 act sometimes irrational to a helpful tip/security messure. That might be something to push on at the therapist. Idk if the doc knows what's even going on in full but you should visit with him and your whole family once to get everything on track.\n\nI also hope you will find your little fellow. It's hard to find a cat since they are totally different when released outdoors. I suggest hanging up posters and a little reward. People tend to do stuff for a quick twenty bucks.\n\nAnd please tell your son that he isn't an adult, that has something to do with maturity. He is just on age to be treated indistinct from others who do shit. So you can throw him to the curb if he likes fresh air so much", "Your son has \"executive functioning\" challenges. This is a well-known developmental barrier that's often associated with ADHD or ADD. \n\nBasically, executive functioning is an inability to follow the basic rules of being an independent person. Getting dressed in clean clothes, following basic rules and norms, shutting doors, putting food away, things that you and I would just take for granted.\n\nIf you look at it as an executive functioning challenge, it's less of a personal choice that he's making and more of a brain development issue. The challenge is- because it's a brain development issue- it's incredibly frustrating but the solution occurs when the frontal cortex fully develops.For your son that will likely be when he's a little older 23 -25 or so. \n\nIn the meantime, as a parent who's been there and worked with a child with executive functioning issues- I used to describe the frustration similar to having a small rock in your shoe. Endless annoying behaviors- few as significant as leaving the door wide open- but many, many, annoying and disruptive behaviors that add up to be incredibly frustrating.\n\nFor what it's worth our son is 27 now and doing well. He has a job and is independent, but we were really struggling when he was an older teenager.", "NTA. He needs more therapy.", "ESH \n\nWhat he\u2019s doing is obviously wrong.\n\nBut parents who kick out their child instead of parenting them and \u2018needing a break\u2019 are also a-holes to me.

Regardless, NTA.", "He is repeatedly endangering your family and your pets.  The outbursts are very concerning. You are protecting your family and your son has a safe place with his dad.", "> He needs to do a lot more work on himself\n\nOr just stop being an idiot.", "Agreed. My hubs has ADHD and I was thinking the whole time I read this that it's the kind of struggle he would have. Forgetting to lock (or sometimes fully latch) the door is a common problem for him. And he's had to learn to deal with his anger and frustration (it's a hugely frustrating, helpless feeling to keep making these mistakes) but he HAS. He fully realizes that it is not my issue and that I'm not being a jerk when I remind him to do things, and he never ever expresses anger toward me. So OP is NTA and the kid needs to learn self-control, but may really benefit from some treatment.", "Sure but if she does that then she needs to have the resolve that he may never speak to her again.", "She said he's seeing a therapist.  Sounds like he may need a different one.", "He needs to learn how to be responsible. I'd say he needs parenting. I don't know if OP has given enough, because alot of kids are resistant to parenting, but it is clear that he is lacking the skills required to be an adult.", "OP said he sees a therapist regularly.", "He\u2019s in therapy according to the OP. It sounds like she\u2019s done everything that could be hoped for without much impact to me.", "It sounds like she's tried to parent him many, many times. If you're 18 and don't understand closing the damn door, I don't know what to tell you. This is a bad take.", "Way to blame the victim.", "And after he's been going to therapy as well."]}
