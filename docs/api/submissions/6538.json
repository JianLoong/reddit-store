{"id": 6538, "submission_id": "103vry2", "title": "AITA for sending my son to stay with his dad because he left the door unlocked?", "selftext": "I (45) am a single mom. I do not have a lot of rules, but I expect the few I have to be followed because they are for both for safety and common courtesy. My (18M) oldest child has always had difficulty following rules. He is also extremely irresponsible and does not seem to understand how his actions affect others. \n\n[LATELY] When he does something wrong, he gets irrationally angry about it or tries to rationalize it. Any comment, even constructive criticism, is met with aggressive anger and name calling. By his own admission, he has anger issues, [he\u2019s working on them] and he sees a therapist regularly. He even blows up at himself when he\u2019s alone in his room if he spills a drink or stubs his toe. It\u2019s completely over the top. \n\nNow that he\u2019s legally an adult, if we have a disagreement, he will immediately start yelling, name calling, and say that\u2019s he\u2019s an adult and I can\u2019t tell him what to do. He\u2019s made some poor decisions that have negatively impacted our family and does not seem to understand consequences at all. If this was any other relationship and not my child, I would have ended it long ago. I am sick of his blow ups and being called names in my own home. And I am sick of him doing whatever he wants with no regards to how his actions affect others. It causes a lot of unneeded stress.\n\nTonight I hit my breaking point. He went out and when he got home, he did not lock the door or even check to make sure it was latched. I heard him come in and called out to lock the door because I was in the back of the house at the time. He ignored me. The door was left wide open and one of our cats got out and is now missing.  \n\nThis is not the first time he\u2019s failed to close or lock a door. I have woken up twice in the last year to discover my front door wide open in the middle of the night. Luckily both those times our pets were secured in other rooms and did not get out. And thankfully no one came in. \n\nDue to his anger issues and the fact that he can\u2019t be trusted to do basic but important things like close a door, I no longer feel safe with him here. I called his father tonight in tears, and he immediately came over and helped look for our cat. He spent hours combing the neighborhood with me and agrees that our son\u2019s behavior is not ok. \n\nOur son did help look for the cat, but he doesn\u2019t understand why I am so upset over a mistake. I told him a mistake that keeps happening is a choice and that he has no regard for our safety or how his actions affect others. \n\nFor the safety of me, my other children, and our pets, I asked his father to take him to stay at his house for now. Our son is mad at me for doing it, but I need a break from him. I am heartbroken our cat is still missing and worried about how my other children will react when we tell them, and I am so angry that it all could have been prevented. So AITA?\n\nEdited for information:\n\nTo all of you who have reached out with concern for my son and the cat THANK YOU for all the advice! \n\nInfo: \nI was diagnosed as an adult with ADHD. It is suspected [I had suspicions during the Covid shut down and online learning] that he has it as well. He has not been formally diagnosed due to personal interests/possible careers due to the stigma associated with it, meaning he would be unable to pursue a career in either of his chosen fields with an ADHD diagnosis. His dr/therapist are both aware, and he\u2019s been working through it in therapy - coping skills, anger management, triggers,etc. I thought we were doing the right thing to protect his future, but now I am afraid it isn\u2019t the best decision. I will reach out to his therapist for advice. \n\nAnd for those who are using this quote against me, \u201cif this was any other relationship and not my child, I would have ended it long ago,\u201d I stand by it. As the victim of domestic abuse, I was encouraged to leave the relationship (not my coparent). We do not want to perpetuate it. Verbal abuse is still abuse. If it were my husband, folks would suggest I leave and break the cycle, but since it is an adult son, I am a bad mom because I don\u2019t want to take it? No, but I can continue to work with my coparent and address the issue in therapy, which I am doing. I love my son, but that does not mean I should enable him to keep making the same choices and sticking others (his family/me) with the consequences of his actions.\n\nEdit: I would also like to point out that my son\u2019s doctor and therapist as well as his school have been aware of my suspicions concerning ADHD and heredity. It\u2019s not like his condition was ignored - in terms of health, mental health, or education. During Covid shutdown, our education system as a whole had an extremely difficult time educating due to online learning and restrictions. During his junior year, my son took responsibility for his learning and made sure he was on track for graduation this year.  All comments from an education stand point have been positive. My concern is regarding the anger/attitude that manifested in the last year and during/after his first real relationship, which in hindsight appears to be related to ADHD particularly how it affects relationships and understanding/expressing his feelings in a healthy way, as well as showing empathy. So those of you who are suggesting this is an ongoing issue that has been ignored and dates back to his childhood are making assumptions that are wrong. Don\u2019t forget that I was diagnosed as an adult and I am still figuring out how these things affect me, not to mention how it affects my adult child.", "created_utc": 1672914724, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103vry2/aita_for_sending_my_son_to_stay_with_his_dad/", "score": 4097, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he wants to pull the, \"I'm an adult, you can't tell me what to do\" card, a reminder that you are not obligated to provide a roof over his head or food on the table for him is an important lesson for him.", "NTA- people forget that children can also be perpetrators of abuse against their parents. You deserve to feel safe in your own home and your children deserve to feel safe. It's not like you sent him out on the street, he is staying with his dad.

You've done everything you could for your now-adult son, & it's not as if you're throwing him out on the street with nowhere to go; you specifically commended him to the care of his other parent. Your safety, & the safety of your other kids, matter a hell of a lot more than this particular son's bent feelings.", "NTA. You have an out of control son, who fails to take responsibility for his behavior, doesn't care about consequences, and is putting your safety and property at risk - repeatedly.  At 18, your 'power' over him is greatly diminished and short of kicking him out to the street, sending him to live with his father is nearly the only thing left in the tool kit. You did the right thing.", "NTA, but obligatory is your son being treated by a medical doctor or occupational therapist for executive function problems? \n\nFrom what you've said here he doesn't appear to be doing this stuff intentionally and it is not under his control.

But since he claims to be an adult, let him pay rent, pay for his phone, internett, insurance etc. suddenly being an adult is less fun. \nTo close the door is something he should have learned when he was a kid.", "NTA. Your son needs therapy. He is actively endangering himself and others with this behaviour.", "NTA.  But. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t get into a debate about mistakes vs choices.  That isn\u2019t going to be productive.  What might be?  Therapy.\n\nYour son is exhibiting very poor emotional regulation.  It is evident in how he argues and in any personal challenges he faces (spilling a drink).  Simply telling him the consequences isn\u2019t going to drive change in his behavior.\n\nWhile he is an adult, and this is a pattern, and I would make the same choice you are, he also needs help.  Please also encourage that.\n\nETA:  the fact that he is currently in therapy wasn\u2019t in the original post.  As noted above, while I would make the same choice as OP, I doubt it will improve his conduct.\n\nHere is why.  Telling someone who is being irresponsible (and worse) they are being a hurry will always make you feel better.  But it will only spur change in those who are receptive to it AND have the emotional tools to deal.\n\nYes, likely ADHD.  But so much more is going on here!!!!  And son doesn\u2019t want to disclose potential ADHD because he might limit career options.  News flash:  inability to focus is a problem that needs addressed.  Or lots of careers will be excluded.  But we have a ton of frustration and anger behaviors as well.  Again, career limiters.  \n\nSon needs to focus on resolving the underlying issues.  Period.  Otherwise everything is in peril \u2014 friendships, romantic relationships, family relationships, roommates, work, etc.\n\nSending him to dad is understandable and what I would have done.

There is lots of research that show that unmedicated and untreated ADHD cause this behavior.  Is it executable yes and no.  He doesn\u2019t have the tools to deal with his issues and he needs medication.  It is also VERY well known that for severe ADHD medication IS the only way to deal with it.  If you have low to moderate you may develop tools but that is not the case for severe which based on this kids actions seems to be the case.  If the kid does refuse to get help then I agree it\u2019s not the persons fault but I also HIGHLY doubt a kid this severe did not have issues earlier.  Why didn\u2019t they get them help earlier?  As for medication doesn\u2019t work, on its own no although it helps significantly.  The point of medication is that it helps set a base that allows them to develop tools that also helps.  But therapy on its own will never be sufficient for sever ADHD.  I\u2019d recommend reading the book Russel Barkley which shows research on how unmedicated ADHD can lead to reduced outcomes and even life expectancy.\n\nAs for diabetes, it\u2019s is actually quite relevant.  Research in ADHD show that there is an imbalance or lack in dopamine.  No therapy can \u201ccure\u201d a lack of dopamine in the brain only medication can help with this imbalance.  So yes, if people with ADHD can have reduced life expectancies because of their disability and this can be ameliorated by giving them medication then the correlation is similar.  Again this may not be as significant for someone who has a milder form of ADHD but for severe white high impulsivity this is not the case.  Again, please read Barkley book which has research on this topic (also he lost his twin brother due to high impulsivity from ADHD).", ">Not trying to be a bitch but what else was she supposed to do? \n\nShe was supposed to get him help for his ADHD and not try to hide from it because he has dreams of being a cop.", "I'm curious if this is what it is though.

They were simple: keep your room clean, no screaming at me because she didn\u2019t like something I did, like tell her to keep her room clean, pick up after herself (she frequently just threw wrappers and empty bottles and cans on the floor) having guests gone by the time I got home from work at 11 pm or midnight.

A very relevant point is his own father understands why you did it and thinks you were correct. You are doing your job by getting him into counseling.
