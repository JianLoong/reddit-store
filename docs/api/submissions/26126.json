He suffered an accident back in July and broke 2 vertebrae. Fortunately, the spinal cord was intact and he can still walk.\n\nAlan is a dead beat guy. He doesn't have a job, he doesn't have money and his income comes from selling the drugs that he doesn't consume. They both consume ketamine, and he smokes weed too. Due to his injuries, he started taking very strong medications, but kept his drug consumption. On top of that, he asked Leah if Robert (20M) could move for some time. Leah told me that \"he would pay for his food and stuff\" and lead me to think that Robert would pay for his share in the rent. Spoiler, he doesn't.\n\nSo, we are 4 people living in the same house while only Leah and I pay rent, water and electricity.\n\nBoth Leah and I work 10h shifts and arrive home late, so Alan and Robert are the only people home. Alan has been a pain in the ass since he moved. Once, he ate all of my gluten free nuggets (I have celiacs) and then proceeded to tell me that he didn't eat them although he was the only one home. Then, last week, he ate all of his yogurt, cheese and vegetables and proceeded to point his finger at me, even though I left home at 7 am. The same day, he hid Leah's key and gaslighted her saying that her key was in the right place, although she searched for it for hours while he slept and she couldn't enter home. He also complains all day long about the dishes and, although it's true that most times I leave the dirty dishes at the sink, I do so because I work from 8AM to 8PM and I don't have time to wash them before leaving, but I wash them at night.\n\nTwo days ago, I was offered a room. I told Leah that I wouldn't pay September's rent since I would be moving out next week, and she told me that \"She cannot afford the entire rent by herself this month, and that I should have told her beforehand\". I came home to Robert shaking on the balcony because he took a little much coke, Alan moving like a zombie due to the medication and Leah angrily smoking one cigarette after the other, trying to calm down.\n\nI decided to give her an ultimatum and said that, if she wants me to pay rent this month, she must kick them out. I don't care about them, I just want to arrive home and be at peace, and not to worry if my cats found their drug stash.\n\nI'm not going to move to that room since they don't allow cats.\n\nMy boyfriend supports my decision, but Alan said that I am an asshole for wanting to kick out a \"sick man\".\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1693741539, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168uwbs/aita_for_wanting_to_kick_a_sick_man_out_of_my_home/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Two freeloaders, using you two as mommies and daddies. Drug pushers! You are condoning drug pushers! Does that make you accomplices in case arrests ever occur?? If you know where their stashes are I would call for a policeman when they are not home and have him search the flat and take the drugs.  What he elects to do to/with the guys is up to him.  You also could tell your landlord there are drug pusher(s) living and storing their wares in your flat.  In the US they could have the government take their building away if they let it continue. Plus its a violation of most leases to let people live there who are not signatories to the lease.  Absolutely NO ONE had the right to put you in the situation you are deeply involved in.
