She asked me what about the cake I ordered and I told them to cancel or do whatever they want with it because I don\u2019t want it anymore\n\nAnyways part of the story got around and most people are saying I reacted to harshly and that at the very least I should have paid for the cake i ordered in advance.", "created_utc": 1691235159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15itcq3/aita_for_not_picking_up_a_cake_i_ordered_because/", "score": 803, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs professional help desperately and VERY MAJOR YTA.", "Who knows what the actual look even was \ud83d\ude44\n\nEither way, OP is wrong and TA though.\n\nOP, was the \u201clook\u201d like this \u2014> \ud83d\ude44 or this \u2014> \ud83e\udd28 or this \u2014> \ud83e\udd78? Is the look in the room with us now?", "Legally the store could make her pay, especially if they merely kept appropriate records.  OP is a twit.", "You hit the nail on the head! I have RBF when I zone out, when I'm concentrating really hard and when I'm trying to eavesdrop on a conversation in a restaurant (or so my husband tells me).\n\nAlso, \"crickets in my brain\" is fantastic and I'm definitely going to be using that from here on out!", "Was also thinking, maybe they recently lost a baby/pregnancy and were just sad. \n\nYou can take your business anywhere you like for any reason but grow up.", "This!! \n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I was thinking. Entitled Op thinks the world revolves around her child and refused to stop and think about the reasons why (which you perfectly covered)\n\nWe used to have a neighbour and for the first few months I thought she hated me because of the look on her face. We still said hi every time we passed and eventually got to talking. She had suffered a stroke a few year\u2019s before (she was only 31 when it happened) and was still dealing with facial paralysis. One of the loveliest, sweetest people you\u2019re ever going to meet. But her expressions often didn\u2019t match her mood \n\nHey Op, YTA and an entitled, unempathetic one at that", "Oh my god. Your comment has just made me think\u2026. What if the employee was actually going through infertility or had recently had a miscarriage? What if it wasn\u2019t a mean face but a sad or wistful face? What if it would\u2019ve been the employees baby\u2019s first birthday too but the baby didn\u2019t make it and the employee is just trying to hold it together?", "When I was in Afghanistan one of my friends was killed by a car bomb on his way back from leave, just having proposed to his fianc\u00e9. I was reeling from this, and waiting in an office. A young man asked me why I always looked so angry. I could tell that he was embarrassed as soon as he said it, and when I looked surprised he said he\u2019d seen me walking around base a few times that day. He was mortified when I told him that my friend was dead. \nPeople have other things going on in their lives that we can\u2019t ever know about.", "This is exactly what I was thinking.   OP, YTA", "My thoughts too. \n\nYou never ever know what someone has been through. Why not try being kind? I feel so bad for the worker. \n\nOP, yes YTA.", "Because a worker didn't properly acknowledge her crotch gremlin. I get people love their kids...great! But...Why do you expect everyone else to love them?", "I have some pretty bad RBF.  I'm also childfree (don't hate kids, just don't want them).  What a sense of entitlement OP has that everyone must acknowledge her baby and smile/wave.  I've had people smile at me and have wondered why and it's usually because I look a bit angry and I correct it (but I'd never expect others to).", "Seconded. Some parents are so entitled.", "Here's hoping she had to pay online or beforehand for the cake and just left them with a free cake.", "I have resting bitch face. I could be having a party in my head but you\u2019d never know it looking at my face. I get complaints that I look \u201ctoo cold\u201d when I\u2019m thinking (at my desk looking at code on a screen and not needing to interact with colleagues at all).", "Exactly. I worked in a bakery one summer as a kid. One of the hardest jobs I\u2019ve ever had. You have to wake up absurdly early, are on your feet all day (and by 10am you\u2019ve been on the clock for 6 hours) and the pay is minimum wage or close to it and working with the public is just awful. \n\nThe bakery staff aren\u2019t clowns which are there to amuse your goddamn baby. YTA.", "I\u2019m also having doubts the woman was making a mean face at the kid. She may have just zoned out or had an annoyed face while the mom was digging through her purse for her card.", "The worker might be a teen themselves. Which would explain the \"mean\" face haha", "OP is a TERRIBLE customer and frankly erratic human being to even do what she did. YTA OP. And no one has to like your baby, better get used to that.", "Probably all the entitled parents with their \"angels.\"", "happy cake day!", "But but but HER BABY! It\u2019s the main character!", "Right, who knows what the employee was going through in her own personal life and, honestly, I'm a pretty big scary looking guy and am kind of uncomfortable about speaking or waving at kids as I never know if they will keep waving or burst out in tears. Nobody is required to make a fuss over or entertain your kid, no matter how precious OP thinks she is. \n\nYTA", "She mean mugged the next messiah Doncha know!!", "The employee may not have even been looking at the baby. My sister's \"resting bitch face\" looks like pure disgust. We have so many photos of her, lost in thought, but to the outside world, she looks absolutely disgusted by: babies, dogs, flowers, tourist destinations, etc. That's just her face and it's so funny to us. But I can guarantee a stranger has assumed that face was for offensive reasons at least once.", "One of those times where I hope OP gets the full circle treatment and finds that noone will make her a cake because the bakery contacted all the other bakeries in the area, and Walmart is sold out.", "Exactly wtf, not all people who aren't friendly with kids are mean. Some of them are embarrassed, socially anxious, had trouble having kids, miscarried, their kid died, they are infertile, or just plain exhausted from working. The entitlement here is just OMG, nobody owes you anything. Also the baby smiling and waving to everyone isn't really ideal, it's important to teach her not everybody is friendly and she taught her people owe her things because she's nice.", "I was thinking that, too. Like...OP ended up just hurting themselves/their kiddo in the end...", "I\u2019m mean the one year old won\u2019t understand or remember.  First birthday parties aren\u2019t for the child. They are for the family.   Of course for OP nothing will ever be about the child, it will always be about herself and the attention she can garner as a mom.", "This is the best, most thoughtful response I've seen so far!\n\nThe *customer mask* is so spot on when it comes to customer service. Plus the way OP described it there seems to have been a line as well by the time she got there.\n\nYTA OP, there are SO MANY other appropriate reasons for the face of that worker. You're kind of contradicting yourself going from \"I don't care *if* someone acknowledges my baby\" to \"I don't care for *how* they *possibly* acknowledged my baby\". Honestly seems like you only hurt yourself by walking away without a cake. Hope your child doesn't have RBF when they grow up", "Or even if it did have to do with the baby....the worker didn't say anything, she just didn't engage with the baby....just because you think your baby is adorable doesn't mean everyone else has to.", "Part of my trauma is randomly having thoughts of my shitty childhood and getting an angry expression on my face. It doesn\u2019t matter what I\u2019m looking at. Anyway Mom is a total AH", "Is it terrible I got the impression this is a teen mom?", "I cannot vote this enough. I\u2019ve had a couple of miscarriages and sometimes seeing babies just makes me really really sad.", "OP isn't only a huge AH but an entitled one as well.", "Even Sesame Street had Oscar.", "If it was a small business and me, I probably would give it to another customer for free", "You forgot your \"YTA\". \n\nYTA OP.", "Hope that isn\u2019t the only bakery nearby. They put her on a do not serve list. Lol. My bakery manager used to have a list of peopel like her who for custom cakes had to prepay before we made it. If they caused particular issue and she recognized them, she wouldn\u2019t even write on a cake from the cooler without them prepaying.", "Yeah, OP is like \"what you bunch of internet strangers aren't sticking up for my baby, nvm I don't want to know AITA or not anymore\"", "Even deleted the account! \u201cNo, everyone on here is wrong, I\u2019m N ta, they are for not acknowledging how special my baby is\u201d", "Could *have\n\nThe confusion comes from the contracted form, could've, which sounds like \"could of\". This applies to would've, should've, must've, I'd've, etc. \n\nI did just recently encounter a \"kind've\", which is innacurate- in this case, the phrase is \"kind of\" or \"sort of\".", "Its so annoying when women get to the cash register and are not prepared to present their payment. You have to stand there while they dig through their purse and wallet like they are surprised and didnt think they would need their card.", "Some people don\u2019t grow up, they just grow old", "Definitely, one time during my stint in retail some withered old hag and her grandson lost a quarter one one of those gumball machine things. I told her I needed to let the manager know to reimburse her and log it. I turn to go to the office that was right there and she threw a tantrum because I... turned around? I guess she expected me not to break eye contact like she was a Weeping Angel or something. You really never know what innocuous thing is going to set these self entitled customers off.", "And now they don\u2019t even have a cake for the kids birthday - what a classic example of cutting off your nose to spite your face.", "The employee doesn\u2019t even need this serious a reason to not smile at the baby. Maybe they don\u2019t like kids, or (and I know OP will find this hard to believe) maybe they\u2019re thinking about their own life and not considering OP\u2019s baby at all. YTA, OP. You sound insufferable.", "I mean, that\u2019s a lot of conjecture. Something tragic doesn\u2019t have to happen for someone to be scowling. I have serious resting bitch face; if you don\u2019t know me, you probably would think I\u2019m mad if you glanced at me and I wasn\u2019t otherwise engaged in a conversation or something like that. If I catch someone\u2019s eye, I tend to smile or change my expression and not because \u201cthey caught me mean mugging\u201d them like OP believes they did with this lady. It\u2019s just because it\u2019s the friendly thing to do. \n\nI\u2019m inclined to believe something along those lines happened here. The woman either naturally scowls or she was thinking of something entirely different and didn\u2019t realize she was glaring at the kid. Hell, even if she did want to mean mug the baby, it gives no right to OP not to pay for the work already done. Theft of services sets a far worse example than a cashier who might have had a bad day.", "OP better not run into people on antinatalist, she\u2019s in for a rude surprise lol", "Where I live, ordering a custom-made cake is entering a legally binding contract. I hope the bakery sends the OP the invoice and/or bans her from the Store", "Deangelo? How are you doing after that basketball injury?", "Dya think OP is also furious when the dolls her daughter waves at don\u2019t respond?", "What service are they supposed to improve?  Have their employees ignore their actual jobs to make faces at every one?  \n\nYTA op", "I'm terrified for the child", "But it\u2019s OP\u2019s baby! Everyone must acknowledge her!! /s", "No need to address it all. The cashier doesn\u2019t have to like babies and she didn\u2019t do anything to the baby. The OP is an AH and the world does not revolve around her baby.", "Also, as someone who is a proud owner of a resting bitch face, that could just as easily be it, too.", "Meet the parent, forgive the child.", "OP is going to be so angry when the paper she wrote for sweet baby doesn't get an A++.", "This all day. It\u2019s going to be hell.", "Worker was probably busy thinking about other orders or any other number of tasks that still need to get done.

Miscarriages and infertility issues here. I even have a kid and still sometimes probably make a not great face at babies because I have a lot of trauma surrounding then. This is just such a weird thing to complain about.", "I\u2019d lay money on it. Parents think the world owes their kids a favour. No. Most parents do. The woman sucks.", "Realistic parent right here!!", "Let's also not assume the persons look was dirty at all.

I would bet money she sat the kid on the counter while she was trying to find her card and pay for the cake. Any place that sells food hates when people do this because it\u2019s a liability and it\u2019s unsanitary. There\u2019s a bakery / ice cream shop near my house that has signs asking people to please not sit or stand their children on the counter because it\u2019s such an issue. (But people still do it because people are trash.)", "Entirely possible. We never know what others are going thru.\n\nThe bakery completed the task that was agreed on there wasn't any stipulation about being a child entertainer.

I have three kids who were adorable babies (just like everyone else\u2019s) and people would often acknowledge them, but I can\u2019t imagine NOT buying a cake I ordered because someone did NOT acknowledge my baby?! That\u2019s not THEIR job?!! Not everyone likes babies, it is not required to make any special gestures or give attention to someone\u2019s child! I absolutely love babies, baby phase is the best phase for me and there are times I don\u2019t want to acknowledge someone\u2019s else baby bc I am in a poopy mood or tired or rushing.

If I catch someone looking at me, I tend to smile or change my expression simply to let them know I\u2019m not mad. Someone doing that isn\u2019t the \u201cah ha gotcha\u201d moment OP thinks it was. I mean, maybe this lady did really scowl at the baby, but so what?
