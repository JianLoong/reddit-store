Sex is not a science. You can't guarantee orgasms. The only thing she accomplished is that if/when they hook up again he'll have this on the back of his mind and it'll probably hinder his performance. In the end, she's just hurting herself.", "I have a wonderful partner who puts in every effort to make sure I\u2019m satisfied and I\u2019m extremely attracted to\u2026 but it definitely takes me (the woman in the partnership) far longer to orgasm. 36 and I\u2019ve never managed it from penetration alone. Gotta use a toy and even then takes some work. I\u2019d love to be able to get off as easily as any of the men I\u2019ve been with.", "Didn't say anything about finding the \"right\" guy, you just need to find the ones that aren't selfish, and/or are willing to expand their understanding and practice of sex beyond sticking their penis in X orifice.", "To be fair that actually makes a lot of sense to me.

I guess that\u2019s the nice thing about Reddit sometimes, open mins etc.", "I get you. Having said that, if she\u2019s the one asking, it\u2019s probably a little frustrating which I think is fair. She shouldn\u2019t have to tread on eggshells.", "We can tell you\u2019re a feminist. The whole gender reversal thing is bullshit.

Everyone can learn their partner\u2019s body and figure out what they like. I\u2019ve only ever slept with one woman, no practice, and I could easily get her to finish. It\u2019s not about skill. It\u2019s about communication and caring about your partner\u2019s pleasure. I agree with your opinions on most men\u2019s view of sex, as society definitely socializes men to believe their pleasure is more important. It\u2019s not a gendered issue, it\u2019s a societal issue that creates a gender gap", "lol it's not his fault she invited him at that hour, if she wants to invite someone at that time then she has to deal with the aftermath,  invite him earlier if you don't want him to be tired", "Absolutely", "There's times I've had to finish myself because my partner was done before me. Doesn't mean I had the right to berate and belittle my partner, then blame them for experiences with other women. She should have brought it up in a respectable manner, not be a jerk about it. You keep missing that detail in all your comments", "Disagree. Regardless of gender, someone doesn\u2019t suck because they changed their mind about sex. Given that they have an established sexual relationship where he typically does get her off, I doubt he went into it scheming to only get his and leave. This is on par with the \u201cyou\u2019re giving me blue balls\u201d argument. She didn\u2019t get off once in a consistently fulfilling sexual relationship - that happens occasionally when your sexual partner is human and not a robot. \n\nI\u2019m a woman and there have been times I\u2019ve stopped someone mid-sex because I was in pain or tired or not in the right headspace anymore. If they dragged me over the coals and gave me shit for coming over when I wasn\u2019t gonna give \u201cfull effort\u201d for doing that one time despite an otherwise satisfying relationship, I would be pretty pissed.", "Clear and open communication isn\u2019t \u201ctreading on eggshells.\u201d", "He said he was tired.

He was tired and she pushed. Get over yourself.", "Bro it was SIX AM AFTER BEING UP ALL NIGHT, and he DIDN\u2019T EVEN WANNA HAVE SEX, it was OPs idea. Also it doesn\u2019t sound like he refused to get her off. Sounds like he finished first and OP threw a baby tantrum.", "what\u2019s to respect? he pumped one out and rolled over. if your partner doesn\u2019t care enough to give you a hand before they go to sleep they do not care enough period.\n\nedit: typo", "Helping her finish doesn\u2019t necessarily involve even touching her. My bf will sometimes just talk dirty in my ear while I finish myself if he\u2019s too exhausted to physically get me off. I can easily do the same to him. It goes both ways- no one is necessarily required to physically touch the other person, as there are many ways you can get off without another person\u2019s touch. It\u2019s kinda like if you\u2019re having phone sex with someone and mainly focusing on one person\u2019s fantasy for them to get off, and once they do, them saying \u201cthanks for the orgasm. I\u2019m gonna hang up now.\u201d", "No, it isn\u2019t.", "i\u2019m confused as to when she \u201cpushed\u201d him to have sex with her? like where does it imply that? lol", ">Far too many women just can't take no as an answer.\n\nOh are we doing a gendered thing about being pushy about sex?

Also gonna say, if I demanded them to finish me afterwards, and they didn't want to, that could be viewed as me being sexually abusive. It absolutely sucks, but sometimes you just gotta deal with it yourself. She should have talked with him about it, but she didn't have to be an ass", "She\u2019s the one who wanted the booty call at 6am and then got pissy when the man was tired lol. Atleast he left so she can finish herself off", "this is tickling me fucking pink \ud83d\ude2d i didn\u2019t even clock the last part of his comment", "Mmmm. Gonna go with you've never got laid in your life.", "and then he said that was just gonna happen sometimes. she didn\u2019t demand anything, she told him she didn\u2019t come. how obseqiously should she have said it, exactly? he messed up, did you want her to pat his head and tell him she\u2019s sure he\u2019ll do better next time? i\u2019m sure you\u2019ll give a shit about your partner\u2019s pleasure next time?\n\nand yeah, that would be sexually abusive. she didn\u2019t do that. no one (to my knowledge) told her to do that. when someone is bad in bed, we don\u2019t force them to do better, we find someone else. \n\nhe can\u2019t get her off reliably (by his own words) he doesn\u2019t care enough to try (by his own words) and when he\u2019s called out on it he throws a fit. dump him.", "but he wasnt too tired to use her like a cumrag. if he was actually tired he wouldn\u2019t have come to her house in the first place, he was just being selfish and lazy \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Dude. Come on, what are you 5? \"Bet you never had sex, buddy\". Lame.", "Because she went straight to being passive aggressive, instead of talking like an adult. \"Hey, I know you're done but could you help me finish? It's not fair to me that you get to finish and I don't\" probably would have gotten a different response than \"oh it's nice you're done, but I'm not\"", "It\u2019s a lose lose scenario she seems like the type to throw a passive aggressive freak out if he goes sorry tonight doesn\u2019t work i\u201dm too tired."]}
