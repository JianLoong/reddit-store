Of course you\u2019re NTA.", "Not the ass\u2026.. though after she clearly indicated that she thought it was okay for your 8 year old daughter to babysit her 2 year old cousin AND yelled at the 8 year old after YOU had told the 2 year old\u2019s mom to watch her own child AND she didn\u2019t because she thought the 8 year old was in charge\u2026\u2026. I would report the mom for child abuse, neglect, and child endangerment to the authorities BECAUSE I would be afraid that she doesn\u2019t understand that 8-yr-olds are NOT old enough to care for other children and could potentially be risking her child\u2019s safety\u2026\u2026. AND when she gets pissed off, kindly explain that you were concerned for her daughter\u2019s safety based on her expectations that your young child was of babysitting age.", "I got confused between the two kids and thought that it was the 15-year-old painting with the two year old and I still thought the sister was TA. It is no one else's responsibility to watch your kid, especially a child.", "You most definitely are NTA. 8 year old kids understand what responsibilities are, but that doesn\u2019t mean they fully know how to complete a task. Even adults make mistakes. Your daughter was doing you the favor of keeping an eye on the 2yo that way she wouldn\u2019t get in the way. It\u2019s as simple as that. Without a distraction, that child could\u2019ve been running around in the kitchen causing accidents. It was not your daughters full responsibility to make sure everything went smoothly. She\u2019s just a child herself. The 2yo mother is TA here.", "NTA. First of all, it's laughable that she expected an eight year old to babysit her two year old. Secondly, even if your daughter was old enough to be a babysitter, she still wouldn't have been responsible, because she never agreed to babysit anyone, and Sarah has a responsibility to look after her own baby.", "NTA. 8 is too young to be watching a child herself.", "NTA. It's no one's responsibility to watch her kids when she is there,  esp an 8yo. How ridiculous.", "An eight year old isn't responsible enough to be left in charge of themselves, never mind supervising a toddler   \n\n\nCousin's girlfriend can't look after her own kid. Blaming a little girl for her negligence shows a worrying lack of maturity", "NTA. I mean, I was the oldest of three, so I was always expected to look after my sisters, even when I was eight, but Sarah shouldn't automatically expect anyone of any age to look after her child.", "NTA. If you are expecting the 8 year old to take care of the 2 year old, then that should have been made clear in the beginning. 8-year-old is perfectly capable of minding 2-year-old with family present. But it should be her choice and with expectations spelled out.", "Well, I could see the person being stupid enough to ask and accept an 8 year old to watch a child.", "The eight year old was the one crying", "This makes no sense. She told her cousin\u2019s gf to look after her own child because the gf was the one who got after an 8 year old child. If someone yelled at your kid, why the hell would you just walk away from that person and go to their spouse? This has nothing to do with sex/gender equality. It has to do with a grown ass ADULT yelling at a CHILD that is not hers. Plus, she also told the gf that if she can\u2019t look after her own child, then to make OP\u2019s cousin do it..which happens to be a man.", "I'm pretty sure they addressed Sarah because they were *right there*", "NTA \n\nShe is responsible for her child. Your 8 yo is not a babysitter.", "NTA--Super lazy parenting!", "She\u2019s obviously a neglectful parent. I feel bad for the little girl.", "Eh 8 can be old enough depending on maturity level, age of the other kid, activity, and distance from adults.", "He was not there when I asked. He was driving around looking for an open store. They were going to bring juices for the kids and ice. They forgot the ice. He was driving around looking for somewhere to purchase the ice.\n\nThen he went out again to purchase whiskey. My uncles refuse to let him drink their whiskey with coke. They have a tradition, my uncles, that the purchase a more expensive whiskey to drink at Christmas. The had a Chivas 18.", "No. An eight year old is not a babysitter. Period. No excuses needed.", "I think it's kind of a gray area. An 8 yo should not be the person ultimately responsible for a 2yo. An adult should be around and keeping an eye on things. But the 8yo with the 2yo should be grown enough to report to an adult if there's a problem. This is how groups of 8yos manage themselves. If 5 8yo are at the park, mom could turn her back knowing that if one falls off the monkey bars, the others would shout. That doesn't mean mom can go off and get her groceries for an hour. \n\nThis situation is smack bang in this grey area because while an adult may see having paint up your nose as a problem, an 8yo just thinks \"oh we have paint on us\" and so it's the adults responsibility to monitor for that.", "That's an assumption. You have literally nothing to make you \"pretty sure\" other than guessing.", "She told the gf to do it multiple times before. The gf is also wrong but OP is sexist for not asking the cousin. Two people can be wrong.\n\nObviously Sarah is super wrong. OP is also wrong for being sexist. OP is not wrong for standing up for her child and setting reasonable boundaries. OP asked if she was the A and she was an A at one point in the story.", "Then I take back what I said. Sorry!", "It\u2019s called repeating yourself because people are too stupid to understand the point being made. Sexism has nothing to do with anything. She told the PARENT to look after their own child. Someone yells at my kid, I will repeat myself a thousand times if I have to. Sex/gender have absolutely nothing to do with protecting my child. OP\u2019s cousin isn\u2019t the one who got after a child that wasn\u2019t his.", "And I was explicitly talking about another part of the scenario. I have absolutely no objection regarding OPs reaction regarding the part of the situation that you are referring to.\n\nIt's generally a good idea to read what someone has written before calling them stupid.", "NTA!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were right to defend your daughter. SHe is NOT at fault for thst in any way.", "NTA - first, I thought you were talking about the 15yo and still Sarah was the a-hole. Realizing it was your 8yo daughter involved, she's an extra a-hole.\n8yo are no babysitter, 8yo need a babysitter!", "Nta  its not your daughters job to watch Sarah's daughter. It doesn't matter if they play together it was Sarah's responsibility to watch her child. The next time your daughter plays with Jenny tell your daughter infront of Sarah that if she wants to play Jenny she can but it is not her responsibility to look after Jenny. That is her mom or her dad's job. So if Sarah tells her anything about taking care of Jenny tell her to go get you and you will have a talk with Sarah.", "NTA \nSarah needs to learn that 8 year olds are not old enough to babysit a child.", "NTA.", "NTA", "I\u2019ll keep this in mind, thank you.", "Not saying you're wrong per second, but it absolutely happens. I was watching my younger brother at 8 when he was 3. Just GenX things I guess", "Well that\u2019s why I was saying it\u2019s dependent on a lot of different factors. When my kids have the day off from school and I\u2019m working (wfh) they basically play, can do non-messy art projects, and my oldest is perfectly capable of getting snacks or drinks. He really likes to do it, and I wouldn\u2019t force him to do it, but he also knows what\u2019s ok and not ok to do if I\u2019m in a meeting.\n\nKnowing this sub I already hear the cries of parentification, but that\u2019s not it at all. If he comes to me and says he\u2019s over it I pop my head out more often and handle things.\n\nAgain: it\u2019s all about age, maturity level, and activities.", "Just because it happened doesn't mean it was safe or smart.", "I think there's a lot of difference between \"keeping an eye on a sibling\" when adults are in earshot, and \"babysitting\". I think the former is fine (but I understand people might disagree with me) while the latter is not.", "Agreed. I came to pick my 9yo up from a birthday party a few weeks ago, and she had taken the 2yos little sister to go play on the swings while everyone else was eating. It was adorable and she was more than capable of doing it (and wanted to do it). Doesn't mean I'd put them in the house and leave \ud83d\ude02 I think people have odd ideas of the capabilities of kids around here and assume everything is done from a place of neglect rather than letting kids grow up and feel grown up.", "Of course! But it did, regularly, and back then at least in the circles my family moved through was accepted that 8 was early to start sitting, but not verboten", "Babysitting doesn\u2019t necessarily mean leaving the house though. It could be as quick as \u201cwatch your younger while I run and fold laundry\u201d and as long as \u201cI have a meeting, please make sure they don\u2019t hurt themselves for 30 minutes\u201d. I\u2019ve never left them alone in the house, minus running garbage out.", "I don't think it can be considered \"babysitting\" as long as a responsible adult is in earshot."]}
