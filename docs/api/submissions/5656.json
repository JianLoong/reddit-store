If you are expecting the 8 year old to take care of the 2 year old, then that should have been made clear in the beginning. 8-year-old is perfectly capable of minding 2-year-old with family present.

No excuses needed.", "I think it's kind of a gray area. An 8 yo should not be the person ultimately responsible for a 2yo. An adult should be around and keeping an eye on things. But the 8yo with the 2yo should be grown enough to report to an adult if there's a problem. This is how groups of 8yos manage themselves. If 5 8yo are at the park, mom could turn her back knowing that if one falls off the monkey bars, the others would shout. That doesn't mean mom can go off and get her groceries for an hour. \n\nThis situation is smack bang in this grey area because while an adult may see having paint up your nose as a problem, an 8yo just thinks \"oh we have paint on us\" and so it's the adults responsibility to monitor for that.", "That's an assumption. You have literally nothing to make you \"pretty sure\" other than guessing.", "She told the gf to do it multiple times before. The gf is also wrong but OP is sexist for not asking the cousin. Two people can be wrong.\n\nObviously Sarah is super wrong. OP is also wrong for being sexist. OP is not wrong for standing up for her child and setting reasonable boundaries.

Sorry!", "It\u2019s called repeating yourself because people are too stupid to understand the point being made. Sexism has nothing to do with anything. She told the PARENT to look after their own child. Someone yells at my kid, I will repeat myself a thousand times if I have to. Sex/gender have absolutely nothing to do with protecting my child.
