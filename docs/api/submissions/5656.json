My mom and I were hosting this years family Christmas party. I have two daughters, eight and 15. English is not my native language. \n\nThe family is from my moms side. My grandma was present, my moms two brothers and her sister. One of her brothers is single. The rest was their with their spouses. My cousin (m32), son of my moms sister, his girlfriend of more than 7 years Sarah, their daughter (f2) and Sarah\u2019s mom.\n\nMy daughter Aly was playing with the girl (f2), I\u2019ll call her Jenny. They were finger painting. I asked Sarah if she could keep an eye on Jenny, because I was helping my mom with cooking. We were going to eat, so I told the girls to clean up, I helped them pick-up all the supplies. I asked Sarah, please help Jenny wash her hands. I could see Jenny\u2019s hands going to her mouth. I stopped her. I walked away to put away all the painting supplies. I came back and my daughter was crying. I asked what was wrong and she said Sarah told her that Jenny had paint in her mouth and up her nose. She (Aly) should have done a better job looking after Jenny.\n\nI told Sarah, my daughter is Not your babysitter, she is just eight. Her reply was, they were playing together, so it\u2019s her responsibility to watch after the younger one. I said, I told you to keep an eye on Jenny, you should have been with your daughter. She kept insisting that she was not needed because Aly should have looked after Jenny. I told her next time to ask her boyfriend to look after Jenny if she can\u2019t be bothered.  She gave me a scowl and walked away. They ate and left immediately after.

You clearly stated that you asked Sarah to keep an eye on Jenny while you were busy with cooking, and it wasn't your daughter's responsibility to babysit her cousin. It was Sarah's responsibility as the parent to make sure her child was safe and not putting paint in her mouth or nose.

This isn't worth making an eight year old feel bad, when she was being nice to play with the littler kid in the first place!", "NTA. Sarah needs to parent her two year old and stop expecting child care from an eight year old. The only thing an eight year old should be doing when playing with a two year old is know when to shout for help from a grown up.
