The OP said she left them there and didn't take them when she moved. So it wasn't a high priority then and apparently she was waiting on an invitation to come get it instead of just asking.

I'm sure from her perspective you overstepped, and even if she doesn't live with him there are probably things of hers there which is why she was overly concerned.\n\nHowever, now that you see how it is, I suggest that you get all of your things out of his place.
