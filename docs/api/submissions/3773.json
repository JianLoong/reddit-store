He should have given you the chance to collect your belongings. You should have asked before just going into their bedroom to collect those things. The girlfriend overreacted and is being extremely dramatic. Has she been wearing your clothes? I might question that.", "YTA\n\nThat is no longer your space. You dont just walk up into someone else's closet. It is just not done unless there is a previous STANDING agreement. Your agreement with him was severed. You overstepped.", "YTA. You're not in a relationship and don't live there anymore. You should have asked for permission first.", "YTA.\nYou're not in a relationship anymore. You should have asked him for a change of clothes. A whole lot of drama could have been avoided if you had just used good manners and good sense and simply asked him instead of going into his personal area.", "YTA\n\nYou don't go into another couple's bedroom without their permission.\n\nNow that the topic is prescient, it would be good to get all your things. \n\nYou already know the new girlfriend isn't going to tolerate them being there any longer. \n\nYour stuff is leaving one way or another.\n\nMake a decision quickly, and your ex should be appreciative that you want to handle this chore and reduce drama in his life.", "YTA \nYou don't just go in someone else's bedroom and go through things. If he still has your stuff, ask that he accompany you there to remove it all, and be done with it. You should  have taken it back or written it off when you separated. Your behavior  it inappropriately familiar, and you don't live there now.", "YTA. Just ask! It takes 2 seconds to ask someone if you can go into their room.", "I don\u2019t think your a giant A maybe a little A, I think your ex probably didn\u2019t care but just asked what else you did afterwards because his gf was being so persistent about. Also, tho I do at the same time you should have asked to go in there in the first place and understand that this isn\u2019t your home anymore", "YTA you no longer have the right to enter his private space and should have asked first", "YTA.\n\nIf he has a Gf, i assumed it has been some time since you lived there. Why would you assume your clothes would be where you left them?\n\nNever go into someone's room without permission", "YTA. You should have asked one of them first", "NTA. The alternative to this situation is that you were wearing vomit.\n\nIt was your clothes. Now might be a good chance to have the conversation to remove your clothes from his house!", "Sorry, but YTA. You should have, at minimum,  asked", "YTA You don\u2019t just walk into someone else\u2019s room.", "YTA\n\nBoundaries. It might have been your stuff but it was in your ex's room. You should have asked beforehand.", "I completely understand that it is your clothes but I am sorry that because you went into his room in his home YTA. It\u2019s because it is his home now and no longer yours even if your stuff is there, you can get them rightfully so but only if you ask for permission. Things have changed and you are a guest now in the home. \n\nAlthough I don\u2019t know how long girlfriend has lived there or if she lives there, but it seems like it would matter more if he was concerned and felt violated.", "YTA, but not a big one. While they're your clothes, it's not your house, and it's not like it's a jacket you brought that day and left in a coat closet.  You should have made a request to your ex before. You were invading their privacy in order to get to your clothes. But also, you should have taken your belongings home by now.", "YTA - but only for not asking before going into someone else's room. It looks a bit suspicious and easy to be accused of snooping around or something.", "YTA- If he has a girlfriend, you shouldn\u2019t have went inside their home without letting one of them know first because it probably did look like you were snooping. Not to mention, did he ever tell his girlfriend that those clothes were yours or did he give them to her as a gift and now it looks like you\u2019re wearing clothes meant for her (though, this wouldn\u2019t be your fault).\nIt\u2019s just rude to go into someone else\u2019s home without telling them to go change or do anything for the matter if it isn\u2019t using the bathroomz", "YTA\n\nYou left your things there when you moved out. That's the first reason you're the AH. The second is you don't get to just go into someone else's room uninvited.", "YTA \n\nYou went \"to see\" if he had any of your own clothes. Meant that you would actually have to go in and look for them. And you were vomit covered.....wouldn't it have been way better to ask him to bring you clothes in the bathroom or something?\n\n\n There is absolutely no reason you couldn't have asked him. You had to walk to his room anyway (vomit covered?) You could have found him. You could have called or texted him. You could have asked literally anyone else there to find him for you. \n\n\n\nAnd his girlfriend has a right to be upset...she might have private things in there.", "ESH. There needs to be boundaries in a co-parenting relationship or it does not work.", "YTA, gotta respect boundaries", "YTA - like it or not, you are a guest in the home. Do you just go into people\u2019s closets elsewhere? I\u2019m assuming not.", "YTA - You *always* had the option to involve the police in you going to retrieve your things. That would have been within your rights.\n\nWhat isn't your right is to go into a private space uninvited to dig through stuff on the *possibility* stuff might be there *that was once yours but likely legally isn't anymore.*", "YTA\n\nYou don't enter someone's bedroom without their permission. Period. \n\nYou seek him out and ask him to grab you something. It's super simple.", "YTA.   \n\n\nI'm sorry but it's their home.  The proper way to have done this would have been to have talked to him and said something like \"hey, I still have a drawer full of clothing in your bedroom (or whatever the case may be), is it okay if I go get it from my drawer in your bedroom, and maybe even get it all while I'm here?\"  \n\n\nEven if it was, at one time, the home you shared together.", "YTA\nNot your home", "esh why is he keeping your clothes in his bed room?", "It was not okay to invade the privacy of his room without consent.", "YTA, it ain\u2019t your home anymore.", "YTA on this one. That's his space, not yours. You don't live there anymore.", "Info why didn't to ask him. Why us your stuff still there  now your relationship is better. . Get your stuff out if his out so this isn't a thing anymore.", "ESH you 100% should\u2019ve asked first-you do not live there it is not your place to go into their room. He shouldn\u2019t be keeping your clothes that\u2019s weird, especially considering he\u2019s moved on and gotten a new gf. New gf shouldn\u2019t be disrupting and throwing such a fuss during a kids party when she could\u2019ve talked to the man and just checked together if anything was missing.", "NTA\n\nEveryone saying ESH because she didn\u2019t ask, do you seriously expect someone to walk around this party covered in vomit, looking for the host to ASK if they can get changed? And what if he for some reason said no? Would she just have to sit in the vomit? \n\nYou took the normal approach to a situation like that and got changed as soon as possible. I\u2019d probably advise you to get all your belongings out of your ex\u2019s house so his new girlfriend doesn\u2019t find it weird that they\u2019re still there and to avoid tension, but you can\u2019t be expected to stay in vomit covered clothes any longer than you have to.", "INFO:  If you guys are on good terms now, why don\u2019t you get your stuff?", "NTA.\n\nYou share kids and were at the house for a party. What you said makes perfect sense on what you would do. \n\nYou could have shown the new gf the vomit covered clothing. It would also show that you had clothes still there.", "NTA. I don\u2019t agree with anyone else on here at all! You were covered in vomit?? Of course you\u2019d want to change immediately. Were you supposed to parade around the place covered in puke to find and ask him?\n\nPeople are weird.", "His girlfriend doesn\u2019t live with him.", "I don\u2019t have them back yet but I doubt she\u2019s wearing or using my things.", "I asked him after this happened if I could take my stuff back and he said I could but he hasn\u2019t given me a time for when I can come collect my things yet.", "No, the alternative is going to ask the ex before going in their bedroom.", "Agreed!", "Guest or not, if youve decided to keep my belongings in your room that gives me permission to go and retrieve them.", "Not their privacy. His privacy. The new gf doesn't live with her ex.", "She shouldn\u2019t have gone into the room even if he\u2019s living the life of a hermit - a bedroom is a very private space.", "Kind of creepy that he kept all of her things.   Even after having a new girl friend.   Does the new girl friend wear the clothing?  Is that how he gets off?  Pretending it\u2019s her?   For gods sake,  give her her clothing back.", "100% this.", "I\u2019m betting cos OP hasn\u2019t made a proper effort to retrieve them (there is a lack of clarity on *exactly* what happened about that - it feels like neither of them could be arsed dealing with it, but the onus should be on her to sort it out).", "It became okay the moment her belongings were put in there and never given back.", "He still should've given you back the clothes so I'm going with soft nta", "You should ask for your stuff back now.", "Definitely use this as an opening to get all your stuff out of their place.", "Have you pitched a date/time and asked if it worked for him? Ask if you can get it when you take your son there next?", "Why is he playing games? He had time for a party he has time to let you get your stuff", "I don't want to pile on because I think in the moment it was an honest mistake but I also don't get why the first thing you did when you got there is say \"hey, I'm getting all my stuff.\"  Unless we're talking furniture or something you don't need a pickup appointment when you're literally already on the property.", "... And it didn't occur to you to suggest a time?", "You dont have to ask to retrieve YOUR belongings just because theyre in someone elses room.", "I agree, even going in the house for anything to use the bathroom is rude unless talked about previously with the hosts everytime.", "Somehow I doubt that. The OP said she left them there and didn't take them when she moved. So it wasn't a high priority then and apparently she was waiting on an invitation to come get it instead of just asking. So they probably worked their way to the back of the closet along with the rest of the unused things.", "That\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling ex is weird as hell keeping her clothes with a new gf", "No, they should still have spoken about it. She had every right to ask her stuff back, but no right to just go in and get it without asking.", "I suggested a few different times but he said he\u2019ll get back to me.", "Yeah, I kind of don\u2019t get why she didn\u2019t get her stuff at the end of the party. When his parents are there and his girlfriend is throwing a fit is the perfect time to say: \n\n\u201cWhy do you want to hold on to my stuff? Since this is causing so much stress, I would really like to take my clothes home TODAY.\u201d \n\nThen take the clothes with you and leave.", "In what world? You can't just go through someone house because you believe your belongings may be in there. Op said she went to \"see if there were\" any of her clothes still. \n\nWhen you have moved out and established another residence,  and this ex has another live in Gf, it's absolutely inappropriate to just go in their room and start hunting things.", "Yes. You have to ask even to retrieve something of yours in another's room/house. It's a breach of privacy.", "I\u2019m still not clear if OP made a real effort to collect her stuff. From the kinda vague replies, it doesn\u2019t sound like the ex *refused* to let her take them. \n\nAt best, it\u2019s very presumptuous to just waltz into his bedroom and rifle through cupboards looking for her clothes. At worst, it\u2019s a power play, designed to make his GF feel uncomfortable.\n\nAnd if she changed in his bedroom, that makes it even worse again.", "Sounds to me like they were both just lazy about it", "She is asking him repeatedly and he keeps dodging her.", "Well he is TA too then. You are entitled to your belongings.", "She didn't write that, only that he hasn't offered, and that sounds more like he forgot.", "Read her comments"]}
