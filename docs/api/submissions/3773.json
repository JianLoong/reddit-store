The OP said she left them there and didn't take them when she moved. So it wasn't a high priority then and apparently she was waiting on an invitation to come get it instead of just asking.

I'm sure from her perspective you overstepped, and even if she doesn't live with him there are probably things of hers there which is why she was overly concerned.\n\nHowever, now that you see how it is, I suggest that you get all of your things out of his place.  Since you have young children who can spit up on you, I also suggest you keep a small bag of clothes in your car for such emergencies.", "INFO: Why are your things still there?

I think some women do it too.", "Reread OPs responses", ">Kind of creepy that he kept all of her things.   Even after having a new girl friend. \n\nAgreed. At LEAST get them out of the bedroom -- put them in a box in the basement so they're ready to be picked up at OP's earliest convenience. Who wants a closet full of their ex's clothes?", " You\u2019ve clearly had chances now, why are you keeping them there?", "Having someone's property when they have asked for it back or when it is clear by the circumstances that you are no longer allowed to possess their property is considered theft in many states. \n\nWhen cohabiting people split up under circumstances where they are angry at each other, they rarely move out right then and there. One normally leaves and then makes arrangements to retrieve their stuff later. She was never offered that chance.", "If someone has stolen something from you, they have lost the right to cite manners as a defense. Someone who shows no respect to others gets none in return.", "It doesn't but that is a superfluous detail. It is in his locked house. Unless she planned on damaging his property to get her stuff back, she would have had to been offered the chance to retrieve it. He never offered her that chance.", "She didn't ask until after the party. We don't know how long it's been.", "She did, but when she gave the times to him he said he would get back to her about them, but never did.", "She did, but when she gave the times to him he said he would get back to her about them, but never did.", "I did. They\u2019re very unclear as to exactly what happened. Which leads me to believe that it\u2019s not all on the ex why she didn\u2019t pick up her belongings. Which I already said in my previous comment.", "I\u2019ve had a breakup where the other party just keeps putting off returning my things, eventually it never happened. We can\u2019t assume ex is asking her to get her things.", "If the clothes were *so* important, she would have taken them with her when she moved out. Better yet, she would have seized the opportunity to collect them at the birthday party when she barged into his bedroom.\n\nI suspect she wants to pick up her clothes at a time that conveniences her only. She shouldn't still have clothes at his place. She had the opportunity.", "Ah yes the 'show no respect get no respect gambit'. A solid defence against trespassing I'm sure.", "That's still not stealing. She left the clothes there, it's not like he held them hostage when she moved out. She needs to be firmer with setting up a time to pick them up.\n\nReading some of her comments in the thread, even after going into his room, she STILL doesn't have all of her clothes. Why not seize that opportunity? lol", "This is so strange. The two of you can coordinate on a birthday party, but not on you picking up your own clothes?", "I would imagine because it was her son's birthday party and that isn't very birthday party like behavior.   Considering the GF had already made the party weird, I wish she'd also taken it, but I could understand why it could feel like \"I don't want to cause any more drama at my son's bday than has already happened here.\"", "Right?! Like I would have announced at the party I was taking my stuff and dared him to stop me. \n\nI would not allow this man to keep me on a leash while dangling my property in front of me. \n\nHell, I would have asked his girlfriend in front of him if she didn't think it was weird that he was holding his ex's property hostage. Like this is a power play and I'd be damned if I continued to walk away with my tail between my legs. Give me my sh!t or I'm coming with a police escort."]}
