You can do what you want in your own home.  You aren't running around naked in front of open windows.\n\nThe husbands should not be staring at you through your windows.

Don't know for sure what bible verse says something about judging someone for a speck of dust in their eye while looking at them with a plank in yours.\n\nLearn to ignore these people.
