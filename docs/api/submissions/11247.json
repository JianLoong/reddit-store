They are friends, not a couple), you need to be fully dressed, including a bra, shirt, and appropriate shorts or pants.\" My daughter went to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and the next morning, she was yelled at for going to the bathroom and not being dressed appropriately (she was in pjs). \n\nMy daughter is stuck there for 3 more days because she can't change her flight, and a new one-way ticket costs $250 and has a layover, making a 4 hour flight 13 hours.
