As long as you aren't deliberately doing striptease in front of an open window while shouting at the top of your lungs, *\"Hey!!! Look at me! Look at meeeee!!!!\"* They are way out of line.", "INFO To OP and all those voting NTA, would you  be ok if the person working out with the drapes wide open, without sheers, is a 50 year old in a Speedo with a gut? I\u2019m being serious. \n\nIf a dude is in a speedo, standing in front of his window, with the drapes pushed to the side, is it ok if he does jumping jacks for 30 minutes a day?  still ok?\n\nOP you may think a sports bra is AOK inside your house (and I do too), but in front of a window with no drapes, might be a problem in your community. \n\nYou don\u2019t not want to start a war with the local police. Believe me, those communities have a way about making you miserable, and will eventually force you out of your nice community.\n\nThis is not a fight you want. Believe me.", "NTFA. You are working out in your own home. You are not responsible for perverts listing after you while you tend to your health. You shouldn\u2019t have to accommodate those wives. The fucking audacity of them to say that shit. They definitely blame women who get SA\u2019d. They are disgusting.\n\nIf anything I would threaten to call the cops just to have a report on file because god only knows if one of those creeps spying on you might take it to another level and you want shit documented.", "NTA. Religious people are weird.", "SUPER NTA. It\u2019s your own freaking house!! And it\u2019s not like you\u2019re naked. It\u2019s not your job to stop them from looking in your windows and lusting after you. Sounds like these women do not trust their husbands (maybe for a good reason) and that\u2019s a them problem.", "NTA; those husbands sound like perverts and I\u2019d be creeped out to get letters over being watched doing some harmless workout", "NTA- definitely not your job to police other women\u2019s husbands being creeps. Especially when the wives are trying to pull biblical stuff out. I applaud you for your response honestly.", "NTA, but maybe get some sheer curtains that will let in the light while also giving you privacy. If the letters continue I'd look into making a harassment complaint with the police.", "NTA. It\u2019s so nice of the wives to blame you for their husbands being creeps. They\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.", "NTA. Frankly, I think that's an awesome response.", "Tell them to pluck out their eyes. That is Jesus\u2019s own words.", "NTA Their looking through your windows; they should control their husbands better versus trying to control a women they don\u2019t know. Their letter is so wildly inappropriate. Your free to do whatever you want in your home.", "Nta religious weirdos.", "NTA! This is petty genius and therefore textbook biblical. If your eye offends you\u2026", "I so deeply love this. NTA it\u2019s freaking hilarious. I want updates of what happens next cause this definitely isn\u2019t going to end here.", "NTA, you have every right to do whatever you want to do in your own home. Them being creeps is not your issue. Their wives insecurities are not your issue. I\u2019m sure some women will be getting an ear full lol.", "lol. Gotta love the South. \nNTA, this sounds like a great scene for a screenplay.", "NTA for opening your curtains and wearing standard workout clothes.\n\nBut you were over the top in sending out individual scolding letters to the husbands! A \u201cif you can\u2019t trust your husband, not my problem \u201c response to the wives who actually harassed you would have been better.", "NTA. They\u2019re being rude themselves by trying to control you in your own home. If you were naked then yeah drawing the curtains would be a good idea but if you\u2019re working out in clothes that would be fine on the street what difference does I make.", "NTA.  You can do what you want in your own home.  You aren't running around naked in front of open windows.\n\nThe husbands should not be staring at you through your windows.   The women are trying to control you instead of their pervert husbands.  \n\nYou could always have a special screen made with some saying on it about peeping toms and controlling women to put over your window.  Don't know for sure what bible verse says something about judging someone for a speck of dust in their eye while looking at them with a plank in yours.\n\nLearn to ignore these people.  When you see/meet up with any of them, act so sweet, sugar wouldn't melt in your mouth.  Learn to play the game.", "NTA. \n\nYou rule.", "So they perv *you* and somehow you're the one who's implicated? Dafuq? Nta.", "NTA. You're in your own house, wearing clothes. The busybodies can keep to themselves. And why were women who live on different streets chiming in? Are their husbands driving over to be peeping toms?", "NTA.  You were in your home minding your own business.  Commenting on that when you're in your home is...weird.  (Most Christians don't do things like this, I swear.)

You're a fucking boss.", "Talibangelicals angry that you showed a bit of ankle- in your own house? Sounds about biblethumper of them.", "NTA at all.

Will a public gym let speedo guy in?", "1. No one works out in a speedo\n2. Gut or no gut is irrelvant\n3. Sports bras are see out in public on women working out all the time so OP is more than ok in her home\n4. Unless she lives in some beyond backwards location the police can't/won't do a damn thing. All of the south is not some racist cesspit. Also old southern church ladies don't call the cops on stuff like this generally. They will however gossip & talk shit about OP. Maybe a lil good old fashion shunning, but call the cops? Nah not for that anyways. \n5. Op having a handful of senior god fearing bible thumping neighbors does not mean the entire community is like that as well.  In the subburbs you can easily find 3 flavors(minimum) of christianity  and 4 different churches in one neighborhood.", "well in the case I would wave my curtains open rule and shut them and mind my business.\n\nI am not purposefully in front of a window, I workout in a room that has windows.\n\nWhy are you bringing up the police?

There\u2019s nothing that mentions she likes to work out naked. Even if she did work out naked, if she\u2019s in her home it doesn\u2019t matter. I live in the south and know these types of women. OP shouldn\u2019t be bothered with them. They\u2019re the same types to ask \u201cwhat you were wearing\u201d when a woman is raped. Their husbands don\u2019t have to look. The women don\u2019t have to look.", "I don't blame the wives at all, from the looks of if they wrote that letter out of genuine concern for their husbands being \"tempted to sin\" they're really lovely ladies which is why I wrote the letters to their husbands, they can take accountability for their behavior", "they do bible study together and from my understanding I came up and then someone mentioned seeing the husbands on the porch looking over at my window while doing \"bible study\" which is them drinking beer and doing god knows what", "I'm sorry but I'm failing to see how she's the asshole.", "The wives DON\u2019T trust them, thats why they wrote the letter in the first place.

The husbands should absolutely be taking the accountability, but the wives should never have involved YOU in the issue (short of them saying they were worried for your privacy and give you a heads up)", "Are you new to the Deep South? They aren\u2019t well meaning women. They are judgmental, among other things that I won\u2019t write.", "If the wives are concerned about their husbands being \"tempted to sin\", they need to take that up with their husbands, not you.", "I really hope you hit them with Matthew 5:29 lol", "Because certain more conservative flavors of Christianity blame the person who \"Caused the lust\" rather than you know the actual problem person - their lecherous old husbands.", "I did and a few other quotes I was able to find, it wasn't as many as the letter I got but hopefully it was enough to get the message across. If I knew the bible I might've known where to find more but I let google do the heavy lifting for me", "Right.. I get the why I\u2019m mostly posing it to OP as they\u2019re giving a huge pass to the wives"]}
