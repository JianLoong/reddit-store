Never been any big issues honestly. My husband and I have 2 kids (6 and 10) and my SIL has 1 kid (12f). About 2 months ago she made the choice to switch to a night shift position because it paid 1.50 more an hour. At first it was fine and everything was normal (because her kid was in school) but now that school is out, she has just fully expected me to watch her kid while she sleeps all day. She never asked me. It's just a full on expectation. She will go to take a nap and just leave her kid with me. Her kid can NOT be left unattended. She has severe ADHD and zero impulse control. \n\nWell, I've been getting pretty fed up with constantly watching another child and cooking for an extra child so I told my husband that I was done watching this kid and his sister would have to find an alternative because her kid and her kids behaviors are stressing me out. We sat down with my SIL about it and she said she would start arranging sitters or play dates over to her friend's house. She followed through with this for maybe 3 days and then it was right back to square one. I've been stuck watching her kid again for a week straight and it was to a point of her not even telling us she was going to nap. She would just disappear.\n\nWell, today is 90\u00b0 and I fully intended to bring my kids to the beach but I will not bring my SILs kid because I can't handle her destructive behaviors or bossy attitude. So I caught my SIL sneaking up the stairs and I said \"bring your kid with you. I have plans and I'm not a built in babysitter.\" She said \"please don't do this, in seriously exhausted from how much I've worked\". I told her that wasn't my problem. She didn't work yesterday or today. She can take care of her kid. She is pissed at me because apparently her kid was looking forward to going to the beach with us (I never said she could go) and my SIL \"needs to fucking sleep\". AITA?\n\nETA: this isn't normal naps. I don't know if night shifts screw with sleeping schedules like this (I've never done an overnight) but she will get home from work at 5am, sleep until 2-3pm and then she goes back to sleep at 4:30 to get a nap in before leaving for work at 10pm. On days she doesn't work, she goes to bed at a normal time (9pm) sleeps until 5am and then goes back upstairs to nap at 11am and sleeps until 3-4pm.

Someone has to watch the kid while she is at work regardless.", "NTA, but you aren't handling it well and taking out frustrations with your SIL on the kid. Like it or not, you are all a family unit. The 12 year old probably sees you as a mother-like figure and your kids as siblings. I'm sure she's hurt by your rejection. That being said, the situation is unsustainable. You and your husband should figure out what the lines are of her acceptable behavior (SIL not Niece) and then communicate that to her. Also, 12 is old enough to start taking some responsibility of her social life and contributing around the house. Certainly its old enough that she doesn't need to be constantly monitored. \n\nAlso, I know your wrote there are behavioral issues but that kid needs to learn how to function at some point. I don't know the answer but it should be figured out with the SIL.

She's an asshole for simply pushing the problem off to both her daughter and to you. \n\nClearly you really really dislike your niece, who did not have any control over her mother's job choices.  She's 12 and I'm not sure why she needs \"watching\" constantly at home at all. Sounds like you are purposely taking out your frustration on her which is just wrong. \n\nThe 3 adults need to have a discussion here. When there's zero mention of one of the involved parties (your husband), then it makes me wonder if the 2 other people (you and your SIL) aren't equally at fault in the conflict. It's also not quite clear who the homeowner is here, but if it's SIL's place then it might be time to look for new housing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So she basically baby talks her way out of everything and uses her own diagnosis as an excuse. She mentally acts like a 6yo most days.
