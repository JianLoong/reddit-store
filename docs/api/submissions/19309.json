My mom raised me by herself and I never saw him again. I often make the \"my dad is still buying milk\" joke because it kind of feels like that. It doesn't even matter because I have a great stepdad. My grandma (my dad's mom) still lives near my mom's house, but she herself said she hasn't spoken to my dad in years.\n\nThe only time I saw my biological dad was when he came to my university to give a conference. It caught my attention that he had my dad's name and mine, but then I saw him and he was just an older version of me. I couldn't talk to him after the conference because security wouldn't let me get close.\n\nAnyway, a few months ago I was walking around the mall with my girlfriend and I saw my dad. He was with a woman and a teenager, maybe about 14 or 15. I assumed they were his new family, so I hesitated whether or not to approach them, but my girlfriend pushed me to go anyway. I started to ask \"Are you (father's name)\" he said \"yes\" then I said \"I'm your son\". He looked at me and said \"Sorry kid, you're confused, I only have one son\". I was hurt so I showed him my driver's license to show that I have the same name as him and told him to look closer to see that we are look the same. His wife was confused and said, \"You never told me you had another son\" and then asked me how old I was. I tried to talk to him but he didn't even look in my direction while his wife asked me a lot of questions. Then he got up and said \"We're leaving\" and just started walking so fast that the other 2 had to run to catch up. \n\nNothing else happened for a while until recently when my grandmother visited my mom and called me. She said that my dad's wife has been trying very hard to contact us and my dad has been trying every way possible to stop her, she finally got our numbers, but my dad destroyed her phone by throwing it into the pool so she left their home and is now staying at my grandma's house. After that, my dad started threatening my grandma if she helped his wife contact us.  \n\nI had no idea this was going on. I kind of feel bad that I caused so much drama just by saying hello to my dad in public and I'm putting my grandma in a difficult position. One good thing that has happened is that his wife and my mom have already meet and my mom is finally getting some closure and they seem to be getting along, but I'm kind of scared of what my dad might do next.

Your dad left the big old bomb in the closet of secrets and nuked his own family.\n\nAlthough I'm curious--if you were still in contact with your grandmother, and your dad and his current wife were in contact with your grandmother, how did his current wife not know he had another son? That would indicate there was also deliberate secret-keeping by your grandmother and she's also to blame if she went along with her son's decisions.", "NTA. Your father is the AH for leaving you, and also seeing how he behaved with his current wife, it looks like he has anger management issues. I hope that his wife divorces him and gets full custody of the kids.", "NTA your dad sounds like a pretty bad person, if it weren't for you his wife might've never found out. Approaching him was an understandable thing to do, if he wanted his child everyone from his past life to forget about him he should've provided adequate closure rather than complain now that you're raising questions lol.", "Honey, you are 1500% NTA.  Your father, however, needs to be arrested immediately for abuse.  You did nothing wrong--he was hiding your existence and now your technical stepmother wants to speak to you, which has him destroying her belongings and threatening your grandmother.\n\nReach out to them as best you can, and be ready to help them if need be.", "Okay, so first off, you didn't nuke your dad's family. If it's nuked, he did that to himself by lying to them. Secondly, NTA. It was an awkward situation, and I probably wouldn't have handled it the same way, it's obviously not ideal to trap the man like that in a public setting, but you were just trying to get to know him, you had no idea he'd been lying to his wife and son.", "NTA - You naturally want to have that closure with your dad and how could you know he would freak out the way he did.\n\nYour bio dad, on the other hand, is an enormous asshole. He most certainly fucked around and found out.", "NTA\n\nYour bio dad was wrong to abandon you and your mom and is now behaving terribly in his efforts to avoid any accountability for his actions. You did nothing wrong.", "You caused no drama at all, *none* of it is your fault. It's all his fault. NTA.", "NTA. How he handled having a child was on him. Can\u2019t blame yourself for his reaction. Maybe he should\u2019ve been honest with his current family.", "Well, your dads chickens have come home to roost. \n\nSucks for your dad. \n\nNTA, you were polite and respectful when you met. And let\u2019s hope you take after your mother, because your dad is no prize.", "Absolutely NTA.  Help the wife and kid out as much as you can, go NC with dad, and (if you can) get a restraining order against him.", "NTA\n\nI love how much you fucked up your dads life. Good job! You all deserve better and he deserves exactly what he\u2019s getting. Secrets don\u2019t stay buried forever.", "NTA\n\nNone of the current situation is your fault.\n\nThis is all a direct result of the poor choices your biological father has made and is continuing to make.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He did by lying to them for years.", "nta you didn't cause this", "NTA. Your father sounds like an abusive asshole. He nuked his own life. I hope his wife leaves him and gets full custody of her kid. Your grandmother should contact the police to arrest her asshole son for threats against her and for destroying his wife's phone.", "Nope. NTA. Dearest Dad is the drama lama with his lies, coverups, and blowups.", "NTA... you did not cause the trouble. Your bio dad has been caught lying. Everyone in this situation deserves answers. I'm glad you got it started.", "NTA. Your dad sounds dangerous!\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA, your father abandoned you twice. He is the AH, not you. He does not deserve another chance. You seem like an empathetic young man. You deserve better.", "It sounds like his current wife got in contact with her MIL (OPs grandma) after the fact.\n\nIt sounds like he's been doing his damnedest to isolate her and keep her away from his past.", "NTA but it sounds like he owes your mother 13 years of child support", "You dad can run but he can\u2019t hide!!! NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you but your bio dad sounds like a major AH. It\u2019s good his new wife isn\u2019t staying with him because I would feel unsafe with someone who destroyed my phone. But this isn\u2019t your fault, it\u2019s your bio dad\u2019s fault for keeping everything a secret and behaving unhinged.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Your dad did everything wrong; back when he left and in that mall. Don\u2019t you waste a second feeling bad that his lies have caught up to him. Don\u2019t you dare feel guilty when he tried to tell you that you don\u2019t even exist right to you face. \n\nI hope his wife leaves him and takes as much of their assets as possible. I hope his marriage/reputation/life IS ruined, but it won\u2019t be because of you. He did this. He made every decision for decades for the very purpose of being dishonest and to erase you. He created his mess and now that\u2019s it\u2019s spilled over, he must sit in it.", "OP did the wife a huge favor. It\u2019s best to know what kind of lying AH you\u2019re married to as soon as possible", "I don\u2019t think he felt he was trapping him. He said hello. He could\u2019ve left when he denied his existence but I really don\u2019t think he could\u2019ve known he was going to react that way.", "I wonder if the second wife is even legally his wife or if he\u2019s a bigamist. Did OP\u2019s folks ever formally divorce?", "So your abusive and deadbeat father thought he could keep your existence a secret from his new family, despite you having the exact same name and face as him and apparently living nearby? And you wonder if YOU are T A? No, NTA.", "NTA of course. Your dad is a giant asshole to you and his current family. What a disgrace of a human being.", "NTA holy mother of Pearl you did nothing wrong. He should have been honest with his wife.", "If your dad is some kind of academic, blow him up online. He doesn\u2019t deserve anonymity for his behaviour. Abandoning you is bad enough. Threatening his family is worse. NTA.", "NTA-I know that it was unintentional but that was a sick way to start a nuclear meltdown.", "It\u2019s crazy awesome that his current wife seems to be on your side. Sure hoping you gain a good solid relationship with your brother. \n\nJust take things one day at a time and hold on to the positives. Right or wrong, it truly sounds like you are far better for the way things did happen. You are certainly validated, and so many people never get that. \n\nSending love your way. Keep us updated!", "NTA\n\nYour birth dad has serious issues(hope your mom went after him for child support). Least you know your life wouldn't of been better with him in it.", "NTA- and the very best thing you can do right now is help this poor woman. Anger management issues and destruction of belongings sounds like abuse to me. You didn't nuke this family, he reacted abusively in response to the truth.", "I don't really know what schenanigans he has going on behind the scenes, but you just were curious to see your dad again after so long. NTA.\n\nOr another way to put it: not your fault he keeps being an ass to his families!", "NTA", "NTA:   Truth will out. \n\nIf it hadn\u2019t been you that day it would have been something else a different day.", "NTA I have to wonder if there was something legal or criminal that caused him to take off and then try to erase or quiet that part of his life to anyone who met him in the future. The mention of security at the conference suggests he was the keynote speaker or similar and that dad has some level of notoriety that needs security. Might be some real bad publicity about to head dad\u2019s way if those pieces to the puzzle fit in any way. And Ancestry or 23 and Me would have found the brothers at some point anyway. Glad you got to meet your brother!", "He reacted out of shock. I wouldn\u2019t have just let bio dad walk on by, either.", "Current wife needs to dump him and file a restraining order.", "I feel so bad for her tbh, the dad is a huge asshole and I'm glad OP accidentally exposed him. NTA.", "OP mentions a stepdad, so at the very least, the courts granted their mom a divorce.", "I missed that. Thanks!", "Nta he dug his hole, and now it's caving in on him.", "NTA. But he seems popular . You did not even google him before? Your grand mother never met his new daughter in law ? Curious.", "NTA.  Your bio father could\u2019ve defused this situation in a hundred ways. \n\nYou are so very much not TA here.", "NTA.....the only person to blame is your dad.  He destroyed his family, his current wife is probably realizing there is a possibility he'll abandon her and their children too.", "NTA the truth would have come out eventually but thanks to you, your mom and the new wife will be able to start healing and have closure sooner rather than later. Also your dad sounds... unsafe to be around please don't feel guilty for unintentionally revealing how dangerous he could be.", "NTA.  Although now you know you are better off not having him around.  He is obviously violent and controlling.  It is terrible that he lied to his wife.  It is his lie that got him in trouble, not you.", "NTA. You shouldn't feel guilty. You did nothing wrong. Your bio dad, on the other hand, is a huge AH. Do not blame yourself for his problems. He created this mess and continued to nurture it when he and he alone could have prevented it. Please remember this, because life is full of interactions and relationships. Instead of having an honest conversation with his wife, he became violent. This is not an appropriate reaction.", "He also further nuked his family by throwing his wife's phone in the pool as that was what made her leave. So it's all on him"]}
