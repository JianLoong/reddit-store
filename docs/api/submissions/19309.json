Your dad left the big old bomb in the closet of secrets and nuked his own family.\n\nAlthough I'm curious--if you were still in contact with your grandmother, and your dad and his current wife were in contact with your grandmother, how did his current wife not know he had another son? That would indicate there was also deliberate secret-keeping by your grandmother and she's also to blame if she went along with her son's decisions.", "NTA. Your father is the AH for leaving you, and also seeing how he behaved with his current wife, it looks like he has anger management issues. I hope that his wife divorces him and gets full custody of the kids.", "NTA your dad sounds like a pretty bad person, if it weren't for you his wife might've never found out. Approaching him was an understandable thing to do, if he wanted his child everyone from his past life to forget about him he should've provided adequate closure rather than complain now that you're raising questions lol.", "Honey, you are 1500% NTA.  Your father, however, needs to be arrested immediately for abuse.  You did nothing wrong--he was hiding your existence and now your technical stepmother wants to speak to you, which has him destroying her belongings and threatening your grandmother.\n\nReach out to them as best you can, and be ready to help them if need be.", "Okay, so first off, you didn't nuke your dad's family. If it's nuked, he did that to himself by lying to them. Secondly, NTA. It was an awkward situation, and I probably wouldn't have handled it the same way, it's obviously not ideal to trap the man like that in a public setting, but you were just trying to get to know him, you had no idea he'd been lying to his wife and son.", "NTA - You naturally want to have that closure with your dad and how could you know he would freak out the way he did.\n\nYour bio dad, on the other hand, is an enormous asshole. He most certainly fucked around and found out.", "NTA\n\nYour bio dad was wrong to abandon you and your mom and is now behaving terribly in his efforts to avoid any accountability for his actions. You did nothing wrong.", "You caused no drama at all, *none* of it is your fault. It's all his fault. NTA.", "NTA. How he handled having a child was on him. Can\u2019t blame yourself for his reaction. Maybe he should\u2019ve been honest with his current family.", "Well, your dads chickens have come home to roost. \n\nSucks for your dad. \n\nNTA, you were polite and respectful when you met. And let\u2019s hope you take after your mother, because your dad is no prize.", "Absolutely NTA.  Help the wife and kid out as much as you can, go NC with dad, and (if you can) get a restraining order against him.", "NTA\n\nI love how much you fucked up your dads life. Good job! You all deserve better and he deserves exactly what he\u2019s getting. Secrets don\u2019t stay buried forever.", "NTA\n\nNone of the current situation is your fault.\n\nThis is all a direct result of the poor choices your biological father has made and is continuing to make.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
