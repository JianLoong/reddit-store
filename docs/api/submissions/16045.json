The mother yelled at you because she cannot bear to except that she is entirely to blame for doing a piss poor job parenting her child. At the rate these kids are going, they\u2019ll be in jail before they graduate high school.", "NTA. You did used the options available to you? You didn\u2019t know the parents and teenagers can be an unruly mob and get belligerent and violent. I think you did the right thing. Their future is not your immediate concern, your safety and well-being is.", "Lol NTA. I was arrested for nicking stuff at a young age. I knew bloody well that what I was doing was wrong. I didn\u2019t trash neighbours\u2019 gardens or pinch stuff from where I lived, because that seemed more wrong than pinching stuff from shops. I got a bollocking and a scare from the cops about my future and was told not to be so f*****g stupid. If I compare myself to people growing up nearby, the difference was that I had a future to be scared about. My family was poor but very focused on education as it was something that had been denied to people like us in the recent past. I don\u2019t know your particular group of youngsters but either they\u2019re the AH or the system is the AH, one of the two. You\u2019re not an AH for seeking the peaceful enjoyment of what\u2019s yours.", "NTA. sooner kids learn their actions have consequences the better. \n\nIf I\u2019m reading it correctly. They stole your property. \nWhile harsh it should hopefully open their eyes.", "NTA - its the parents fault if the kids are acting like animals.  and it's their own damned fault if their kids get arrested.  since mom doesnt want to take care of the kids, why should you suffer their misbehavior?  call the cops.  you don't owe them anything.", "NTA I don't know how it is in your country, but mostly there's a difference between adult and juvenile punishment. I can fully understand, that you called the police and I think it was the right decision.", "NTA. ur stuff was stollen and they were misusing ur property. Because they are kids doesn't mean they can do that. And you did not ruin their future, it was their idea to steal and vandalize ur property!", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault that your justice system is stupid. Their future shouldn\u2019t be ruined because of their behaviour at 13 years old, but you aren\u2019t the one ruining it, it\u2019s themselves (and the state).\n\nYou don\u2019t have to endure stolen property and vandalism", "NTA - they are ruining their own future. If they had any sense, this would \"scare them straight.\" One petty theft isn't going to kill their future but a continued criminal streak will", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe way they were acting, they had no future.", "NTA.\n\nIf not you, someone else would've.\n\nTheir mother is the one ruining their futures by failing as a parent.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't ruin the kid's life, his mother did by not parenting him. Your only responsibility in this situation is ro protect your property.", "NTA. They need to reap the consequences of their actions.", "NTA the 13 year old is.  The 13 year old is f\u2019ing up his future.  You are just protecting your things and your home.", "NTA, the kids are going to be caught one day, with or without your intervention. Their future was already ruined by themselves.", "Usually I don't mind walls of text or missing punctuation marks. OP deserves a special award for consistently putting full stops in the middle of a sentence. The result is a wonderful mish mash where you read two sentences and then go back and re-read them with correct punctuation marks to realize it should have been three sentences. Requires sheer genius and hardwork on the writer's part.", "NTA.  You didn't ruin thst kids life.   His life will be just fine so long as mom is alive to bail him out and stroke his ego.  Now, mom's life... well, she was making the bed of paying her golden child debts and mistakes off for life already, so you are just another nail in that one.", "NTA I'm sick of the epidemic of not holding younger people responsible for their actions , most people from a young age know the difference between right and wrong and what's against the law . 13 year olds know exactly what they are doing and they shouldn't be protected so much when they do criminal things. \nTheir future isn't your problem,  they are being more than a nuisance and it isn't just teenagers being teenagers ! This attitude is wrong. I never behaved in such a way as a teenager and nor did the majority of people I went to school with and associated with , the ones who behave like this choose to behave like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
