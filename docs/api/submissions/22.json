I was told it was a couples thing but I was the only guy there.  That's fine. I am okay with her friends. I am past the whole cutesy date thing but I like making her happy.  \n\nBut then they all started ignoring me. Every time I tried to join a conversation or spend time with my girlfriend I got frozen out.  Like I was intruding.  I asked her if she wanted to go do the corn maze with me and it was like I was some creepy guy at a bar. They all had to come along. Like I was trying to seperate her. I totally was but I don't think that's a bad thing.  \n\nAnyways they all decided to split up in the maze and my girlfriend went with them.  \n\nFuck this noise.  I could go catch the Seahawks game if I boogied.  So I texted her that she had five minutes to respond to me or I was going back to town to watch the game and she could get a ride back with her friends.  \n\nI was literally watching the second quarter before she responded.  It took her that long to notice that I was gone.  She said her friend would have to drive really far out of her way to drop her off and that I should come get her.  \n\nI was definitely over the limit and I told her to get an Uber and I would pay for it. She said never mind and spent the night at her place instead.  \n\nI just woke up to about fifty texts from her and her friends calling me an asshole for leaving without telling anyone.  \n\nI did tell her. She just chose to ignore me.  \n\nI'm kind of pissed that I wasted all that gas and time and we never even got to actually spend time together.  I'm upset with her and her bullshit friends.  \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit to provide answers to common questions. \n\nWe have been dating for about six months.  \n\nOur age difference is roughly 3 years and 10 months.  I didn't realize that made me a dirty old man.  \n\nI enjoy taking her out and having fun. She is just starting her career and I am established in mine.  So I like taking her out for fun stuff she enjoys. \n\nWhen I said I am past the cutesy date thing I meant that I would not be the one to suggest a date at a pumpkin patch.  But she was a theater kid and I took her to see Hamilton. She loved it.  I go out of my way to take her to things she will enjoy.  And when we hang out with my friends they all include he because she is awesome.  My friends' wives and girlfriends all in life her in stuff too.  \n\nThis is the first time she has behaved like this.  \n\nThe pumpkin patch had five bars of signal and all of them were posting constantly the entire time they were there.\n\nEdit number two because I can't do math.\n\n The difference in our ages is exactly four years and 37 days.  Sorry.\n\nEdit three\n\n\nFor those of you with a problem with our age difference think of it as her robbing the grave not me robbing the cradle.\n\nFinal edit I think.  \n\nWe spoke.  It turns out that the friends were pissed that I showed up. Not because I was there but because the other boyfriends all blew them off to watch the game. So they basically convinced her that it should be a girls day.  Which was fine. If she had told me I would have gone to a pub nearby to get some food, have a beer and wait for her to get back to me.  I was wrong about her sorority sister from Los Angeles being the tipping point. She was the one saying that they were being dicks excluding me. So I feel kind of bad about that.", "created_utc": 1667203079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi4db7/aita_for_leaving_my_girlfriend_stranded_when_she/", "score": 10916, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You gave her a heads up before leaving as well. Technically she was not stranded as she had other company , had you left her alone this would be a different situation. But because she had company as well I believe you are not the AH at all.", "NTA. Your girl doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s matured yet + she\u2019s with her girls so they\u2019ll have been feeding into her innocence in this argument which won\u2019t help so she won\u2019t admit she\u2019s wrong.", "No you're not the asshole. It was obviously a bad call on her part for her to coax you into going. She should have known how the situation was going to play out. Also shame on her friends for treating you like an outsider. My friends and I always make sure to include our friends significant others in conversation and activities because we all know what it's like to be the odd person out. \n\nAlso the fact that it took her that long to realize that you weren't there or to check her phone to me shows precisely where you rank in importance in her life. Then because you didn't hang around like a good little puppy dog waiting patiently for her, she chose to shit talk you to her friends all night, which I can guarantee is what they were doing, because that's what women do in groups together when they are angry. Your girlfriend sounds ridiculously inconsiderate. Not only do I think that you're not the asshole, I think it's time to get a new girlfriend or to just go back to being single. I mean if you're running into these kinds of problems with something this small and simple, imagine what things will be like when life really gets complicated. do you really think she's going to step up to the plate and be a better person than she has shown herself to be?", "NTA. She literally just used you as a free ride to her friends get together. Would not even be surprised if the girls were planning something shaddy and got upset that you showed up.\nYou are over the cutesy phase so i assume you guys are not together for long.

If she didn\u2019t plan on including you in the outing, she shouldn\u2019t have invited you. Sounds like she just needed a ride.\n\nAnd based on the fact that they\u2019re acting like a high school clique, they probably had their phones in their hand the whole time (taking pictures probably). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal that she took ***2 hours*** to notice you weren\u2019t there when it\u2019s supposed to be a \u201cgroup outing.\u201d", "This will clearly be unpopular but ESH.

She may have been lost in the maze or thought you were. Not in a \"hey send in the sniffer dogs\" way, but that's the way corn mazes work. Getting lost is sometimes expected and part of the fun. I work at a place with a corn maze and many people actively don't check their phones so it's more challenging. Giving an ultimatum you are leaving five minutes before you left is incredibly short notice.\n\nYour attitude toward her sounds incredibly condescending. You are \"over the cutesy date thing.\" Maybe it's the age difference, but you seem to treat her like a child. \"Five minutes left in the pool or else.\" You are both better off not dating each other.", "NTA for sure.

I wouldn\u2019t go as far to say she used you for a ride to get there, as I don\u2019t have enough info to say that.\n\nWhere you suck IMO: you could have called her to let her know your plans, or sent a text with more info (hey, I\u2019m feeling like the odd man out here.

I'm reading from edit number four, your age difference would not be significant if it weren't showing that you two are at two entirely different developmental stages. It sounds like you also aren't prepared to be dating at all, let alone young people so perhaps you should take a break and consider who you are trying to attract and if you are actually prepared for dating\n\nShe and her friends should have discussed it just being a girl's day and had your girlfriend tell you not to come if they didn't want you there. They used you as a ride and then disrespected your presence. That's not okay.\n\nDon't get tricked by this being turned around and her saying that she actually had your back. If she had your back she would have spoken up for you, not gone along with her friends treatment of you ignoring you to the point where she didn't even notice you were gone.\n\nIt still comes down to from your edits she has not apologized, she just turned it around that you were rude for leaving and that she actually had your back and that you are an asshole for leaving. You are not. If you go to an event and everyone there treats you like garbage, and the person who should have your back isn't defending you that is a time to leave.

By the sounds of it you were the transport for her friends day, or at least her transport for the friends day out. Now she's annoyed because you weren't at her beck and call and the echo chamber of her friends is reinforcing that.\n\nGiven the length of time it took her to notice you were gone you weren't even an after thought on that day, you were basically an NPC.

How long have you been seeing each other? Are the any other red flags that you might have ignored?\n\nYou are not at fault here gf and her friends are.", "ESH, you knew she would need the ride back and instead of communicating with your gf like a mature adult, you chose to \"test\" her like you're in high school. Not everyone is gonna be available to text you back 5 minutes after receiving a text. You knew this was an event where she would be on her phone, she also would not have been on her phone had it just been the two of you. You set her up for failure. \n\nShe sucks because she told you this was going to be a date thing and it was an outing with her friends. Use your words like an adult and tell her that's not okay.", "\u2026. Did you actually expect her to come back home to you after this? Sorry if you didn\u2019t see that coming bud, but leaving without confirmation that she knows you\u2019re leaving is just straight up something you do when you\u2019re breaking up, not when you expect to continue the relationship.\n\nETA: Not to mention you literally never talked about it once to her in your account before bailing. Why did you choose not to communicate how you were feeling in that moment so she could have an opportunity to rectify the situation?", "As a friend i would never text the boyfriend of my friend about a fight between them..

Yes, she should have paid more attention to you and included you in conversations and activities.    \n\nBut instead of just going with it, you tried to force it to be a date. When that didn\u2019t happen, you ditched her.  Giving her 5 minutes to respond before speeding off and getting drunk so you couldn\u2019t come back is a pretty big asshole move in my opinion.

On one hand she's an TA if she did invite you and played it like a \"couple's thing\" and you had no idea you would be the only male.

At that point you were used for a ride and maybe payment to get into the thing.  \n\nYour TA part comes it with the text message.  However, I'm leaning more towards a soft version because if they are posting away on their phone, she had to see the text.  I would have made an effort to hunt her down and tell her I'm dipping or called her because people ignore text messages when posting away due to notifications.  \n\nYou need to reevaluate this relationship after you two talk about this corn maze incident.  I would lay it out there about your feelings and their behavior as you saw it.  Own up a bit to messing up and how you should have done more than a simple text to let her know you were dipping out.  Let her know you felt that it was really meant to be just her and her friends, so you didn't want to be third wheel.  Remind her you gave up your time with friends for what you thought was going to be just the two of you, especially if it was implied or explicitly said to be just you two.

It sucks you ditched her but I get not wanting to wait around if you're bored. My suggestion is to not include yourself in activities that have zero interest to you. Also although the age gap isn't huge, my communication skills as a 22 year old were total garbage so it's not crazy that you two are having issues here.", "NTA but it doesn\u2019t mean you did nothing wrong.\n\nI can\u2019t understand your whole relationship in a few paragraphs, but I think if it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s gone out with her friends, than you know she acts like this around them, she might just be excited to see them. \n\nOr she hangs out with her friends and you a lot, and this is the first time this has happened, I\u2019d say sometimes you just have to put up with things for the people you love. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s upset about the act of you leaving, but the fact that the moment things didn\u2019t go your way, or the way you planned you left.", "INFO: If several people go one way and you went the other, aren't you the one who decided to split up?

Stop answering questions from idiots on here looking to demonize you. Nothing wrong with the age difference. However, huge maturity gap between 22 and 27 if you ask me. \n\n2. NTA.

Frankly, her acting like this would make me rethink the relationship, because she IGNORED you, her boyfriend. Honestly she has a mouth to say \" sweetie, the girls are having a bad day, do you mind if we have a girls day only so I can show my support and I'll meet with you later.\"\n\nI wouldn't have ditched you, but she should have said something instead of acting like you don't exit.\n\nYou do realise that you are not as important as her friends, right?\n\nDon't feel bad.
