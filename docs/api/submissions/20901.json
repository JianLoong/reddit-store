{"id": 20901, "submission_id": "14m8ujf", "title": "AITA for telling my friend that her boyfriend was checking me out just to spite her?", "selftext": "I (23f) became friends with Stella (23f) in college. We were roommates and always had a great time together. Back in January Stella decided she wanted to get a boob job. She had always been insecure about her chest size and would usually tell me about it. I completely supported her and told her that I\u2019d be more than happy to help her out during the healing process.   \nAfter a few months her implants had settled in and they looked great. Stella seemed really confident and I was beyond happy for her. The issue was that shift in her attitude. I\u2019m not exactly sure what happened but she started taking digs at me. For reference, I have always had a bigger chest. Stella would always compliment me on it and say how lucky I am. Now Stella comments about how \u201csaggy\u201d my chest is. As soon as I\u2019d ask her to stop she\u2019d say she was just joking. One time we were both wearing a low cut top and she kept calling my chest saggy and saying I needed to wear a bra for them to look good. We got into a fight about it and again I was brushed off and called insecure.   \nA few days ago we were at my apartment with 3 other friends. All of us were playing board games and having fun. After a while one of our friends complimented Stella\u2019s implants and told her how good she looked. I\u2019m not sure what happened after that but she started going at me again. She asked my boyfriend if he liked \u201cgrandma tits\u201d. He asked her what she meant and she started ranting about how natural breasts sag fast and don\u2019t sit as nicely as implants. Me and my boyfriend just looked at each other and didn\u2019t say anything. I honestly just wanted to have a good time and didn\u2019t want to start anything by arguing with her. I kept catching Stella\u2019s boyfriend staring me straight in my face or at my chest so I grabbed my boyfriend\u2019s sweatshirt and put it on. After I put it on, Stella started laughing and whispering with one of our other friends. I ignored it and went to the kitchen and Stella followed me. She made a comment about how men will always prefer perkier breasts over saggy ones. I just snapped at that. I told her that if men liked perkier breasts over \u201csaggy\u201d ones she should explain to me why her man can\u2019t take his eyes off me. She went quiet and she and her bf left.    \nI honestly feel bad for what I said. I told my boyfriend about it and he and our friends that were at my apartment told me I was right. I\u2019ve gotten texts from Stella though calling me a pos and an asshole. She said I took a joke seriously and embarrassed both her and her bf. My boyfriend has also gotten texts from Stella\u2019s bf saying that I started a problem in their relationship just because I wanted to be petty. I don\u2019t feel bad for telling her off but I do feel bad for how I did it. I probably shouldn\u2019t have gotten her boyfriend involved. I will apologize if I\u2019m in the wrong.

She always always always compared by body to hers in a negative light, and caused me to feel insecure about things that aren't even issues!! Including my chest. And my eyebrows. And my feet.

As a friend, you recognized her insecurities, so when she started up on you (unhappy people spend a lot of time criticizing strange things about other people), one would think that your empathy would kick in, and you would lovingly but firmly establish boundaries and ask her if she needs help, because she sounds as if she does.\n\nInstead, you Mean Girled her.

I guess I was holding on to her in hopes that she would go back to her old self and we'd get along like we used to in college.

When she would talk about her breasts I would always tell her that they were perfect and she didn't need anything done. I'd also make it a point to compliment her because I know how it feels to be insecure about your body. When she first talked about implants I told her that I'd support her but genuinely didn't think she needed it. Also, I would never comment about what men like. I don't think u should date any man who doesn't like you for who you are or doesn't think you're perfect. And I would never say anything about guys preference.", "Thanks for your comment. I can totally see how my comment was mean and that's why I'm here but I feel like you're blaming a lot of it on me. I've been nice to her, brushed her comments off or just asked her to simply knock it off. These comments have been going on since March. I've decided I'm not going to apologize because frankly I feel like I was just giving her the same energy. But I appreciate your advice and that you took  time out of your day to write this message.

I'm open to criticism and telling me what I did wrong but calling me a narcissist is honestly weird. Her boyfriend has always been weird towards me. Stella and her bf met through my boyfriend because they were friends. Before they met, Stella's bf would always joke about how he was 'next in line\" when me and my bf broke up. So he was an issue way before. Also, I don't like that her bf was looking at me. I wouldn't have put on my boyfriends sweatshirt if I didn't feel uncomfortable. Theres a lot of background info that I didn't add because of the word limit. Like how Stella would openly flirt with other guys in front of her man. Those guys including my boyfriend. I've told her numerous times that she needs to stop and I get brushed off. I've tried to stay civil about things by ignoring her comments or pulling her aside and asking her to please stop. And I've never said anything about my chest to her or whose is better. It's not a competition and I'm certainly not trying to make I one.
