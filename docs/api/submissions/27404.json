However, due to high levels of blood pressure, she had to stop taking it and therefore is back to bed.  \nI am responsible for cleaning the house, cooking, washing dishes and most of the clothes, taking my daughter (9) to activites, and teaching her when she needs help with school. I also work full time. I do not expect my wife to help, and dont put pressure on her. After all she is sick. But it has been very hard for me, and  until today, our daughter was not being affected by the situation (apparently).  \nNonethless, school called today saying that daughter was crying. She told the school burse that she was worried about her mom being sick all the time. We have not heard my daughter's story because she is still at school.  \nMy wife thinks that this happened because yesterday my wife told the mother of one of my daughter's school friends that she was sick and could not take my daughter to a play date. So wife thinks that my daughter's friend brought up the situation at school and made my daughter cry. Wife also come up with the idea that my daughter might be manipulating her to skip physical education (I would never have thought something like that).  \nMy perception of the event was that my daughter was crying because she is indeed anxious with the situation (mom always sick). I said that we need to find a way to deal with the situation so that it does not affect our daughter. Wife got super mad and said that I was blaming her. I said it is not her fault since she does not choose to be sick, but we do have a problem that needs attention so that we can help our daughter to grow not feeling insecure, afraid or anxious given that the problem exists and for over 10 years and is likely to continue. When my daughter is not listening to her (like to take a shower), she always says to the kid that she feels sick and the kid needs to listen because of that. So she uses her mental issue as a way to make the kid listen to hear (I havent said this because she was too mad already). I also said she should not talk to other parents from my daughter school about her health issues, given that they can tell my daughter's friends and they can bring it up to school.

It can be an extended mood state, but if that is her only mood ever, then you might want to look into an alternative diagnosis. **Regardless, your wife needs to be in psychiatric and therapeutic care for her illness.**\n\nHer illness and the lack of treatment is absolutely impacting your daughter, and both you and your wife are doing your daughter a huge disservice by not continuing to seek treatment. There are so many medications out there, including some newer ones that are worth trying. She also needs to be in therapy to learn how to handle her illness so that it doesn't have such a negative impact on your child.\n\nIt's not your wife's fault she has a severe mental illness, but that doesn't mean she is off the hook for her behavior. It's not a write-off that can be used to excuse her actions and words. It doesn't undo hurt she causes to your child.\n\nShe *cannot* be allowed to continue weaponizing her illness against your daughter. That's abusive, and something that will have lasting consequences, where your daughter could grow to feel responsible for your wife's illness.\n\nYou both need to be taking steps to take care of your daughter. I know it's hard, and you're exhausted from carrying so much of the burden, but if you want your kid to be okay, you need to take action. Get your daughter into therapy to help her with the big emotions she's experiencing about living with a parent with a serious illness.

She needs to be able to share as she wishes to. I also genuinely don't think the real issue is from outside the house;  your wife's assumption that it came from other kids feels like a way to avoid the (unreasonable) feelings of guilt at the thought that her illness is hurting your daughter.

And it will also effect her that her mother is manipulating her into doing things. It's good that she has you and I'm glad that you are making every effort, but at the end of the day  it is an issue that needs to be addressed. It may make your wife mad but it's the truth at the end of the day. It's not your wife's fault that she's the way she is, but it's also not your daughter's fault that her mother being bed ridden with no energy or bandwidth to deal with her is starting to effect her. Honestly that you wife doesn't think that what she's doing, or not doing rather, effects your child and instead wants to say it's a manipulation tactic (which is something she uses herself) tells me that she's oblivious and that you all (especially the mother and daughter) should  get some therapy.", "First of all ADHD medicine exacerbates bipolar disorder. \n\nAlso there are hundreds of medications/combinations to try. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t tried them all. \n\nAlso. \n\nNTA.\n\nEdited to add\n\nYour wife isn\u2019t taking responsibility for herself.

Most ppl don't get the right meds on the first try.  But you don't give up.  You keep trying medications until you find one that works.  And you get yourself into therapy.  It sounds to me like your wife has just given up.  This is detrimental to your daughter.  And worse, your wife is weaponizing her illness.  Using it to get your daughter to do stuff.  Your daughter doesn't need to continuously hear \"I'm sick.....do this, do that.\"  This is not helping your daughter.  And this is probably why your daughter is crying.", "As a person with bi-polar that has be a pain to treat, I get the frustration.

Your wife is manipulating people because of her illness. She seems like she\u2019s using it to get what she wants and that kinda makes her a pretty horrid person.

I've lived with a bipolar parent & I know the depression can be crippling. But my parent has taken medication for almost 30 years now - not fun, not perfect but quality of life is so much better. If she won't go to a psychologist, if you and your daughter can, if you can afford it, go. Or you could consider joining a support group for carers of people with bipolar.", "NTA.  I personally have battled the endless anxiety & depression cycle for years - and while your wife's depression isn't her fault, it is her responsibility to get help to manage it in a way that is healthy for her and her family.  It seems as though she is putting the burden on you and your daughter - you are being a good father to your daughter and sticking up for her.  But it also seems as though the two of you are walking on eggshells all the time as to not upset your wife.  I would recommend getting your daughter into therapy though, as others have suggested.  And I think you need to continue to have conversations with your wife about your concerns for her health.  Maybe even reach out to the doctor that is treating her and voice your concerns.  While the doctor cannot release information about her treatment, they can take your concerns into consideration in your wife's treatment plan.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You need to get your daughter in counseling and advocate for your daughter because your wife won't.\n\nYour wife is using her mental illness as an excuse to manipulate a 9 year old. That is damaging behavior.\n\nYou can't force your wife to get treatment but you can advocate and help your daughter.  At this point your primary concern needs to be taking care of yourself and your daughter because your wife isn't going to", "NTA but she is clearly using her sickness to manipulate others to do what she wants. I\u2019m wondering if she is that sick she cannot do anything at home.", "NTA look I get your wife's point of view deppresion can be terrible sometimes but it seems liek she's not doing aything to fix it. Mental illnesses aren't fully like physical illnesses you can do a lot other than just take pills to get your self out of it. Daily affirmations is the one that worked for me and getting yourself invested in something new", "NTA, you are doing great and your wife needs help. Shes not on a good treatment if she has to stop using it and relapses, talk to psychotherapists even if you already did and good luck... not every therapist is right for your wife and you have to find the correct one", "NTA, and imo you are spot on about everything. Of course your daughter is affected but this, and more so the older she gets and sees that other kids don\u2019t have moms that are \u201csick\u201d all the time and learns about health and the human body and what is normal and not. And of course the more she learns/knows the more she is scared/anxious because she loves her mom and doesn\u2019t want anything to happen to her. The way you have described it almost seems like your wife is content living this way or has given up on it getting better. I mean yes she didn\u2019t choose to be bipolar, but is there not a way to get her blood pressure in check to resume the medication? Or keep trying other types of medications? I know you said she has tried many but she couldn\u2019t possibly have tried them all. Maybe it would help to switch to a new doctor? But at the very least you should consider family counseling, because yes your wife is sick but it is naive to think that she is the only one affected by this. For your wife to be at the point of being bedridden for the better of ten years and you having to have taken on the lion\u2019s share of the household and parenting responsibilities, this has to have taken a massive toll on you and your daughter\u2019s mental health as well. Good luck OP, you sound like a great dad and husband, I hope this gets better for your family.", "NTA you're doing everything you can to keep the negative impact on your daughter to a minimum, and you're asking your wife to do the same. Your request is fair, and it's the right thing to do. \n\nYour wife needs to separate out your daughter's behavior from her own illness, and to be sure to keep them that way - ideally in mentality AND in words/actions. She needs to keep your kid UNRESPONSIBLE for her illness, and to be sure to let daughter know that nothing she does is the cause for her mom being sick. That both mom and dad are there to take care of her. \n\nAs far as not talking to other parents - that may have stepped over the line because it might imply shame for being sick. I think having honest conversations about mental health is more helpful than sweeping it under the rug, and it is your wife's illness, so it's hers to share or not share. I think the focus should be on daughter and minimizing her worry in all of this. If that can be the North Star, hopefully that's a mission she can get behind too.", "You are NTA. \n\nAll of you need to be in therapy. If your wife can\u2019t take medication, she needs to be speaking to someone regularly. And your daughter needs to, as well. \n\nBut the big problem I see from your post is that your wife is manipulating your daughter\u2026.and accusing your daughter of manipulating the school nurse. That needs to be addressed. Your wife telling your daughter that she\u2019s sick, so daughter needs to do what she says, will lead your daughter to believe that if she doesn\u2019t, her mother will become sicker or something worse. \n\nYou\u2019re going to have to protect your child from your wife, regardless of how angry it makes your wife.", "NAH; your wife having depression is obviously not her fault, but she has a daughter, and therefore an obligation to work harder to find a treatment plan that works for her so that she's a present parent. She does need to be trying harder for rhe sake of her daughter, but she's not an AH for struggling to do so\n\nI do disagree that her mentioning her condition to others is a problem, because you'd basically be taking away a potential avenue of support that might help her cope. The issue isn't that others know she's sick, the problem is her illness isn't be adequately treated and she's using it as a sword with her child rather than using actually healthy parenting techniques to get your daughter to do things", "I don't think ur an asshole but I do think you should take this to a chronic illness subreddit to give u better advice than ur probably gonna get here. NAH", "YTA. Talk to your daughter about her classes and how she is doing. If your wife wants to tell the world, let her. Her choice. Just keep clear communication with your daughter. It sucks because your perspective is 100% true and valid. You want to protect your daughter and it's understandable. You can't tell your wife what to do or what not to do because she is an adult. Her method of co-parenting doesn't put your daughter in any physical threat. Just appreciate the ability to share the journey of raising a mini human together.", "NTA\n\nMy wife has medicine resistant bi-polar which favors depression over mania. She has tried pretty much every medication outside of the really heavy stuff. \n\nI would strongly suggest you look into Deep TMS. The company that has a patent on the machine is called BrainsWays. You can look at their website to see if there is a clinic near you that offers the treatment. It turned my wife\u2019s entire life around.

Based on the above, I wish I could give you a medal. Well done my friend. Keep doing what you are doing and protect your daughter.\n\nAs a side note, and this is purely for my lack of understanding. Bipolar makes you bed ridden? Have I misread this? Being autistic, with a wife who runs an autism support network, I can't think of any bipolar people being bed ridden. Is there 'something else' here or do I simply not understand as well as I thought? I know you mentioned 'severe depression' but something doesn't seem all there for me.", "NTA. Take your daughter to therapy. Your wife needs to to. Also family therapy", "NTA\n\nBeing a kid is a lot harder than most of us remember even when things are great at home.\n\nI suggest you see if your daughter is interested in some therapy. It helps to talk to someone removed from the situation and a therapist can shine some light on things. provide non judgmental ears and just generally be a safe place for your daughter to express her thoughts regarding your wife's illness. Everyone says 'oh my kids can talk to me any time' but there will always with children to parents be that fear of blame or embarrassment over certain thoughts.\n\nBipolar is a terrible illness, moods and reactions are based on it and depend on the ebb and flow of the persons highs and lows. While it's not right for your wife to hold it over your daughters head or to react with anger when confronted (however gently), it is unfortunately part of the illness. As your wife is also unable to take the only effective medication perhaps some form of counselling for her as well\n\nYou are traversing a very difficult path in life yourself, this adds stress to all interactions within the family, whether you feel it right now or not. \n\nDon't be afraid to seek someone to talk to yourself sometimes. mental health practitioners can shed some light on both your daughters and your wife's behaviors, help you understand and be a place for you to vent your frustrations without judgement.", "NTA- your wife needs to go back to a doctor, and keep going back as long as it takes to get herself functioning, as a kid who grew up with a mother who rarely got out of bed it fucks with you bad", "NTA. \n\nYour wife should work with her shrink to manage her blood pressure so she can take the ADHD medications. Most psychiatrists (and prescribing psychologists) will do this. It\u2019s relatively easy and cheap. \n\nAnd it would solve the problem, it seems from your post.", "NTA. Let me be very honest. My mom has major depressive disorder, to cope when i was a kid she became an alcoholic. I found her passed out on the living room floor coming home from school. I remember her being in bed all the time. Its now been nearly 20 years since this particular incident, and I *still* harbor resentment. I never really indulged in alcohol, and still refuse to due to her drubken behavior. I can still hear her yelling about her beer being tossed in the sink. \n\nI'm not saying your wife will turn to alcohol like my mom did, but I'm fairly certain her being bedridden and using her mental health against her kid will definitely have an impact on them for a long time", "NTA she's trying to do all sorts of mental gymnastics to make sense of all this when the easiest answer is your daughter sees you and hears you all the time saying you're sick and she's worried about her mom", "Theres also support groups for children of mentally (and generally) ill parents.

PLEASE do not allow your daughter to be confused by this, nor yourself!! I am loving your dedication to both your daughter & wife, however, this behavior from your wife is completely unacceptable.
