Ned's mom has addiction issues and isn't really in the picture.\r  \n\r  \nI booked my 30th birthday weekend reservations at my favorite hot grill restaurant.

This was planned months ago.\r  \n\r  \nA week ago, Kenzie said Jared is going out of town for a work trip, and she will be watching Ned on my birthday weekend.  She asked if she could bring Ned to my birthday.  I said no.  There's a hot grill, we're going to be drinking (enough to need cabs!), and frankly, I don't want a kid at my 30th. Kenzie said she'll stay sober and pay for Ned's meal, and all I have to do is move the party away from the grill (which I already reserved) to a regular table to keep Ned safe.  I still said no.  The whole point of the restaurant we're going to IS the grill.\r  \n\r  \nKenzie is now blowing up the group chat saying that I'm \"discriminating against her because of her family status\".  Fam.  Kenzie has been dating Jared for three months and this is not a child-friendly event.

No.  That's insane.", "Nta that is a ridiculous request", "Your not the Ah in the situation but your friend and her boyfriend are in this situation and here are the reasons why . \n\n1. They been dating three months and she is watching his kid but my question is does his mom know or is she out of the picture?\n\n\n2.  You made it a adult party for everyone \n\n3. If you made the comment three months isn\u2019t long enough to have someone watch your cat then does that mean she can\u2019t be trusted?", "NTA- It\u2019s pour decision making by both of them. This guy leaving his 5 year old with someone he has known 3 months is pretty out there enough. But bringing a 5 year old to an event like that where everyone is drinking is dangerous in a lot of ways and not really the best place for a 5 year old to be around. She unfortunately needs to just stay home and miss out. How could she even think it would be fun for her bringing the kid enough to be upset about it. Seems like to me she\u2019s just salty she isn\u2019t going to be able to enjoy the party like she would have before having to watch her BFs kid. And what 5 year old kid would want to be at this party? I hope that your friends in the group chat aren\u2019t backing this girl at all if they are I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. Spring for the the bill for everything on top of it for everyone too makes it even more a no brainer this girl should realize she\u2019s out of line.", "NTA tell her to stay home", "She's discriminating against YOU because of your family status - she's trying to forbid you having adult events because you don't have her babysitting obligations.\n\nNTA. She can't come - she has a child to look after. Welcome to parenthood, lady - and with any blase dad willing to leave their kid with their new girlfriend during work trips, Kenzie better get used to it...", "NTA, it\u2019s your birthday, you get to say what happens. If Kenzie thinks she\u2019s a parent, the first rule is putting your kid first which means sometimes you don\u2019t get to go out. Don\u2019t change your plans and she gets to suck it up.", "NTA she shouldn't have asked you to change your plans just because she's babysitting! That's her problem, not yours!", "NTA. Kenzie can find someone to watch him, or simply not come. Happy birthday! Hope you enjoy your party. Kenzie is acting very entitled, stay strong.", "NTA", "Don't back down. Maybe offer to meet for lunch with just the two of you later that week. Be gracious. Let her be the a**.", "Jared is clearly looking for a replacement mommy and Kenzie is playing into it. He's getting what he wants and she's stressed out because of it.\n\nDoesn't sound like Kenzie is actually ready to be a mom if she can't assess that this isn't a kid friendly party and hire a babysitter.\n\nOP is NTA. Not all things are for kids and Kenzie needs to see what she's really signing up for.", "It took almost 1 year before my boyfriend let me meet his son and a little longer to actually watch him on my own..", "I knew a girl who left her newborn (a week or two) with a coworker in order to have a romantic weekend with her husband \ud83d\ude33 so 3 months of a relationship for a 5yo\u2026 \ud83d\ude1c", "I know my eyebrows shot into my hairline at that line!", "NTA", "I mean we don't know all the backstory to their relationship, so it's not really on us to decide that, OP is NTA in the current conflict.", "If she\u2019s like this with a kid she barley knows imagine how insufferable she\u2019ll be with her own kids", "NTA\n\nOh man, when my very own sister invited me to her 30th birthday party I felt so weird going even though I was 22 years old at the time. I literally messaged her back saying \"I thought you didn't want kids at your birthday party?\" Before I realized that I am, in fact, *not* a child and I have, in fact, gone drinking with her multiple times before. And even when I did go I felt like a child still because all her friends were 28-35 years old lol. \n\nOP it's your birthday party, you can do whatever you want on it! You only turn 30 once! If your friend can't make it because she's babysitting, that's on her. That's not your issue. You do not have to bend to someone else's rules on your day of celebration. I hope you have a wonderful time, drink lots of water, and stay safe!", "No one should be meeting a kid that early I agree. They get attached and if they break up that kid loses a friend with no choice", "This. Exactly this. I\u2019ve been dating my SO for a year nearly, and he\u2019s only just now getting to do days with me and my little. Beach trip here or there, lunch date\u2026. But no I would not be leaving him with him at all for a LONG while.", "Agreed. She's getting a taste of the sacrifices she'll need to make with a child.\n\nNTA, but the whole situation is weird. OP, I'd make sure to let your friend know she can always reach out to you. She may shun you now because she's angry, frustrated, or \"in love\", but she may also find herself calling upon you one day.", "Can Kenzie not get a babysitter? Or do a sleepover with a friend that she'll reciprocate?", "Oh, honey, no.  He's clearly using her and also doesn't care about the safety and stability of his kid. That is so messed up", "I wouldn't even have introduced a kid to a new partner that quickly... usually the advice I see is 6 months of dating before meeting kids. I understand it is probably harder to do that or you may have a shorter timeline if you're a single parent but yeesh... that's soooo soon to leave a small child with somebody who's essentially a stranger that you're sleeping with.", "If I would ever date someone with a kid and they expected me to watch their kid for a whole weekend after only three months of dating they'd be very disappointed with my big NOPE lol. \n\nIt's your 30th, no one wants a kid around when your plans are to have a few adult beverages, nor do you want to be rearranging those plans for said kid that's not yours. Go, have fun, and let her be pissy bc she can't understand why no one wants a kid around.", "Would a good person try to ruin your birthday?", "Well Kenzie clearly values her social life over Ned, so maybe she's a good person but it doesn't seem like she's a super good girlfriend or guardian.", "But she's a woman! Women take care of the babies! /s\n\nI'm not totally buying the work trip thing either, but I think I save all of my extreme suspicions for this particular subreddit, lol. \n\nNTA, at all.", "THAT BOY AIN'T RIGHT", "Jared scored a bangnanny.", "NTA. She made her choice and the world doesn't revolve around her.", "The wildest thing about that to me is that a week or two postpartum many women are still passing baseball-size clots out their hoohah, which doesn\u2019t seem very conducive to romance.", "A roommate of an acquaintance of my daughter left her SIX DAY OLD baby with her. She said she \u201cneeded a break.\u201d My daughter didn\u2019t know this person, but she\u2019s got a huge heart and took the baby. Ended up having her for a couple of weeks. It\u2019s been two years this month and we haven\u2019t seen her since.", "Perhaps Kenzie is trying to impress Jared by being a good \"mother\" to Ned?", "Yes, avoiding debate with these people is essential. The conflict validates their sense of victimization and they'll fuss about it until a different conflict distracts them.", ">seems very narcissistic\n\nI think she is just frustrated at being the only one in her friend group missing this event. She's getting her first dose of hard reality. I would be absolutely certain to maintain contact with her though. This whole thing gives me a weird feeling, and I'm concerned for OPs friend.", "It's recommended to not even introduce kids to an SO until like 6months....", "You think babysitters know the kid for 3+ months before being alone with the kid? \n\nYes, it's weird to leave your kid with a girl you just started dating but people leave their kids with people they know wayyy less all the time and it's acceptable why, because they are getting paid?\n\nI wouldn't leave my pets with someone I didn't know that well, but it's common in both scenarios to hire someone you don't know well.", "I have a six pound dog and my interview process for dog sitters is a cross between drag race and the hunger games.", "My thoughts too, everything was kind of weird there \ud83d\ude05", "I hope your daughter got a lawyer and got custody.", "Something tells me Jared would be \u201cimpressed\u201d by any woman who takes his kid off his hands", "What good mother tries to take a 5 month old baby (they barely know) to an adult party?", "I would definitely be interested to know whether there is a pattern of past behavior similar to this or if this is the first time. I am basing my response on an assumption of a pattern but can definitely see your point too. Thanks for providing a different view.", "That is exactly my rule and I haven't even dated anyone yet. And 6 months doesn't even seem long enough when I think about it sometimes, due to considering how often a month I would even be able to actually *go* on a date.", "for a week?  you would leave your kid with a babysitter for a week?", "You may be right. Jared left 5-year-old Ned with his girlfriend of three months. Not a great decision, IMO.", "Ned is 5 *years* old. \n\nKenzie may be trying to impress Jared by being what she *thinks* is a good mother.", "I don't have a kid but people hire babysitters all the time. There's whole websites/companies dedicated to hiring out sitters. Not everyone has a relative nearby who is willing/able...sometimes life happens. You can't bring a baby on a work trip. Emergencies happen.\n\nAnd it was a weekend here. 2 days. So yes, if I had no other choice."]}
