For reference, nobody has kids, and the only one dating someone with kids is Kenzie (33F).  Kenzie is dating Jared (35F), a single dad who has a (5M) son, Ned.  Ned's mom has addiction issues and isn't really in the picture.\r  \n\r  \nI booked my 30th birthday weekend reservations at my favorite hot grill restaurant.  I'm splashing out and paying for everyone, including our beer and for the 2 cabs there and back from my place (most are crashing at my place, some people's partners/friends are picking them up).  This was planned months ago.\r  \n\r  \nA week ago, Kenzie said Jared is going out of town for a work trip, and she will be watching Ned on my birthday weekend.  She asked if she could bring Ned to my birthday.  I said no.  There's a hot grill, we're going to be drinking (enough to need cabs!), and frankly, I don't want a kid at my 30th. Kenzie said she'll stay sober and pay for Ned's meal, and all I have to do is move the party away from the grill (which I already reserved) to a regular table to keep Ned safe.  I still said no.  The whole point of the restaurant we're going to IS the grill.\r  \n\r  \nKenzie is now blowing up the group chat saying that I'm \"discriminating against her because of her family status\".  Fam.  Kenzie has been dating Jared for three months and this is not a child-friendly event.  Frankly I'm shocked Jared's trusting his kid to her for the weekend (no shade to Kenzie, but 3 months wouldn't be long enough for me to leave my cat with someone).\r  \n\r  \nAITA for refusing to move my party away from the grill and not allowing Kenzie to bring Ned to my 30th?", "created_utc": 1686854628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14a9uaa/aita_for_not_allowing_my_friend_to_bring_her/", "score": 2194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given her 'family status' comment, I assume that means she's taking up the step mom role, so she should probably come to terms with that reality.
