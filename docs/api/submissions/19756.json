For reference, nobody has kids, and the only one dating someone with kids is Kenzie (33F).  Kenzie is dating Jared (35F), a single dad who has a (5M) son, Ned.  Ned's mom has addiction issues and isn't really in the picture.\r  \n\r  \nI booked my 30th birthday weekend reservations at my favorite hot grill restaurant.  I'm splashing out and paying for everyone, including our beer and for the 2 cabs there and back from my place (most are crashing at my place, some people's partners/friends are picking them up).  This was planned months ago.\r  \n\r  \nA week ago, Kenzie said Jared is going out of town for a work trip, and she will be watching Ned on my birthday weekend.  She asked if she could bring Ned to my birthday.  I said no.  There's a hot grill, we're going to be drinking (enough to need cabs!), and frankly, I don't want a kid at my 30th. Kenzie said she'll stay sober and pay for Ned's meal, and all I have to do is move the party away from the grill (which I already reserved) to a regular table to keep Ned safe.  I still said no.  The whole point of the restaurant we're going to IS the grill.\r  \n\r  \nKenzie is now blowing up the group chat saying that I'm \"discriminating against her because of her family status\".  Fam.  Kenzie has been dating Jared for three months and this is not a child-friendly event.  Frankly I'm shocked Jared's trusting his kid to her for the weekend (no shade to Kenzie, but 3 months wouldn't be long enough for me to leave my cat with someone).\r  \n\r  \nAITA for refusing to move my party away from the grill and not allowing Kenzie to bring Ned to my 30th?", "created_utc": 1686854628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14a9uaa/aita_for_not_allowing_my_friend_to_bring_her/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Simple. Easy. End of!\n\nEDIT WTF Jared is leaving his kid with her after *3 months*? That ain't right!", "NTA\n\nSpeaking as someone with four kids, it's super weird that she wants to bring a five year old to a thirty year old's birthday party, where they know people are going to be drinking excessively. \n\nYour friend doesn't have a familial status. She is not a parent. She is the babysitter for her boyfriend who is a parent. \n\nAlso speaking as a parent, it's super weird that they've only been dating for three months, and not only has she already met his kid, but that he's leaving her alone with him for the weekend.", "NTA at all. Kenzie is being dramatic and unreasonable. Don't budge, this is your night not Ned's.", "NTA. Kenzie is asking for a whole lot of concession for a party that isn't about her.\n\n\"Her family status\" - after three months of dating?? Just...yikes. O_O  Is she usually this delusional? \n\nDon't change a thing, stick to your guns, your adult's only party - your rules - literally. You'll find out that Kenzie isn't really a friend and maybe that is a really good thing to find out now. Wowza.", "NTA. Parenting means giving up \"fun\" nights out with friends to take care of the child. I don't think Kenzie is ready to be a parent.", "NTA.  Her problems are not your problems.  I would say she is well aware of how inappropriate it would be to bring a baby to an adult birthday party.", "NTA\n\nJust keep your cool about it. Kenzie is making some red flag choices, and it's important to remain centered with people who are unstable. Kenzie is unstable, evidenced by her behavior in group chat. \n\nIt sounds crazy, but a great way to deflate these dramas is to validate the source of the drama while maintaining your boundaries and when possible, offering an alternate choice to disappointment and angst.\n\n*These things happen, sometimes people get double-booked and have to decline an event. I understand that you'd like to be with us as planned, and I would too. Unfortunately, bringing Ned means that I would have to change these plans and I am not going to do that. I'm sorry you won't be able to make it, but I hope that you and I can get together soon after this weekend and do something fun together.*", "NTA, why can't people be gracious, it's a child free event and you give some logical reasons why you don't want children at the party. To say you are discrimination because of family status is just plain silly. Un-invite her...problem solved.", "NTA. It's obvious the party is for adults only, it's not even her child yet. You don't need to adjust for others sake", "NTA. All of the safety problems you mentioned aside, this is an adult-only party anyway. He's five years old, there won't be any other kids there. He isn't going to have any fun and will only get bored. \n\nBesides, your party, your rules.", "NTA.   is your birthday, so you get to decide who you invite and where you celebrate.", "NTA. Your party. You want to have fun. It is not a child friendly event like you said so she will have to sit this once out unfortunately, but that isn't your fault.", "NTA. Kenzie needs to tell Jarrod to find a sitter for the night.  Or since she has her new\" family status\" that she is accusing you of discriminating against, she should stay at home with the child. That is what moms do", "NTA, if it\u2019s not a kid friendly event then there is no reason to bring his child.", "NTA\n\nYour celebration, your choice, and a 5 year old shouldn't be at a drinking party that requires cabs for drunks.\n\nKenzie is asking far too much of you. She can't have her life just the way she wants it. We all make choices.", "NTA at all.\n\nYou hit the nail on the the head. This is simply not a child friendly event. Ned could be her bio child and it would make no difference. Not all events are appropriate for kids. It\u2019s wild that she even asked.", "NTA. Not all events are appropriate for kids - it's not a commentary on children or the people who have them.", "NTA. No kids are invited. Therefore nothing is unfair. If other kids were there, than absolutely they'd have a case. This is an adult only.party.", "NTA. You planned an adult only party. She knew that & still has the nerve to try & bend the rules to suit her. Nope. Uninviting her would fix the no kids allowed rule :)", "NTA You wanna play house, well then be careful what you wish for! This is mom life, sacrificing social events is a normal occurrence!", "So let me get this straight. You are being asked to defer to a five year old who has no connection to you and a tenuous connection at best to the person who wants to bring him? On your birthday? This is an outrageous request. What is wrong with Kenzie that she can\u2019t see this? Does she have a history of not understanding social norms? Hard NTA", "3 months wouldn't be enough for me to *introduce* my kid to someone. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour party was planned longer then (or about the same) they have been dating!!  How entitled is Kenzie???  You planned an adult party, she can come by herself or she can stay home and watch her 3mo BF's kid.  There is nothing per se wrong with either.  Is she scared of being alone with the kid, is she so insecure that she'll miss your party and doesn't care if she wants you to pay for a party that you don't want?\n\nDon't move the party.  There is no way your friends are buying this \"discrimination\" BS.", "Absolutely NTA.", "Babysitters !!! Is that not a thing where you live? Tell Kenzie you have the right to celebrate without her bonus child in tow. If she can\u2019t figure out a safe option for Ned she\u2019s going to need to tap out like many parents have to when they don\u2019t have care for their kids.", "NTA. The mature thing for her to do would be to just cancel and for you guys to meet up later.", "NTA\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t have all the legit reasons why this isn\u2019t a good idea, the kid would be incredibly bored anyway.", "NTA \n\nThere are family things and there adult things. This is an adult party.", "NTA.\n\nIf it's not a kid-friendly restaurant in the first place, she shouldn't even be considering bringing a child there. She should have planned better; maybe not agree to watch the child when she obviously had plans. Or make a choice and miss your birthday celebration to watch the child. Adult family status = adult choices.", "As the mom of an almost 5 year old, NTA. Not every event is meant to be child friendly, *especially* adult birthday parties!!! Kenzie should have told Jared about her plans before he went out of town, so that he could have helped find a babysitter for Ned and Kenzie could attend your party.\n\nHBD, OP! Sounds like your birthday is going to be a blast!", "NTA\n\nBut be prepared for her to show up and dare you to refuse to let her and the kid have dinner with you", "\u2018Kenzie\u2019 is kind of recklessly throwing around the term discrimination, isn\u2019t she?", "NTA - it's your birthday and you get to make plans to do whatever you want. However, I am curious as to why a kid in a chair would be in trouble near a grill? Is it like a hibachi restaurant? If so, they have kids there all the time.\n\nAt any rate, there's nothing wrong with you not wanted a 5 yr old at your birthday party and it would be very distracting to everyone.", "NTA\n\nKenzie needs to skip the event. Simple as that.", "NTA. It's your party, planned well before a child's potential presence was taken into account. I guess in a sense one could say you are discriminating; you don't want a child there. But that's certainly your call. \n\nNot everyone can go to every party. People shouldn't take offense at that.

Also yeah it's weird to leave your kid with someone you have been dating for 3m. \n\nHave fun at the b-day.", "I\u2019m a mother and I have a VERY STRICT RULE about absolutely NO ONE meeting my child until we\u2019ve been together for AT LEAST six months. I\u2019d be extremely uncomfortable as well.
