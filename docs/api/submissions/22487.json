If someone with very fine/thin white hair were to wear a style mean for low porosity coily hair it would cause serious damage. If they only kept the style in for a few days it might not cause too much damage, but these styles are designed to be worn for weeks and they take a very long time (hours and hours) to put into place so its not feasible to take it in and out every few days the way that viking braids can be.

Black hair is usually thinner, with Caucasian hair being of mid thickness and Asian hair being usually the thickest. It's usually delicate, while Caucasian has a huge variability in strenght.

Black hairstyles are considered \"trashy\" and \"unprofessional\".\n2. White people decide a certain black hairstyle is cool, actually, and start wearing it.\n3.

Because of the cultural influence white people wield, their version of the hairstyle becomes the default.\n5. The original hairstyle becomes redefined as a bad imitation, and the black people wearing it have even more problems than before.\n\nTo be honest, the only people who can truly believe that 'is just a hairstyle' are those whose hair has never materially affected their life. We can't truly understand the experience, but we can understand how something like a hairstyle can cause a lot of pain.
