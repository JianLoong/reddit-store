They probably would have just as upset if you moved in.", "Mild YTA (towards siblings). You could have offered to sell it to them at fair market value or more.

These people who did NOTHING to you \"make your blood boil\" because they look like your parents. That's not their fault! Your parents were terrible (although sending you to a nonreligious boarding school was probably kinder than if they'd kept you at home, given how they likely would have treated you) but it's not your siblings fault. You did this to hurt them. You could have sold them the house and be done with it, but you decided to be spiteful.", "NTA. What your parents have done to you is unforgivable but I'm hoping knowing that that place that was never a true home to you was blown off the face of the Earth gives you some measure of comfort. As for the siblings you did the right thing in blocking them they got the money in the business and I hope that they just leave you in peace.", "YTA softly. Your parents sound like assholes as well, but sadly from the seems of it your siblings spent more time in the house growing up and seemed to like your parents (even though your parents didn\u2019t deserve it). It\u2019s completely your property and the only thing that was given to you, so you do have 100% the right and freedom to do what you please with it, but you couldn\u2019t even call your siblings to tell them the plan?

But I honestly do think you should have talked to your siblings about this. Have either you or them tried to connect? If they aren't like your parents perhaps you should have talked this out with them and they would have been more understanding as to why you made your decision. You said your parents tried to erase you from their life. Have you ever told them everything that happened? What do they believe happened? Yes, I know it was in your name.

I understand why they feel a little shocked to have their childhood home knocked down shortly after their parents death by their own sibling. \n\nRegardless, this is so much bigger than this post. There's undoubtedly a lot of trauma impacting this decision. If possible, it may be worth talking to a professional. Best of luck.", "You did a very petty thing. What your parents did was horrible.

With the money they inherited, the siblings could have offered to buy the old house from you if they were so connected to it, but they didn\u2019t. You honorably decided that as sole and legal owner of the place, to donate to charity for a worthy cause as part of your healing from an abusive childhood.

I bet watching that house go was super cathartic. You're doing everyone a favor, with the amount your parents smoked, the entire house was probably caked in nicotine.
