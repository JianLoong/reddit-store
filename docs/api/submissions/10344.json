You are not overreacting. My mom was told she was infertile, so she and my dad adopted my brother and then my sister. I was the surprise bio child.

It caused damage to my siblings and even to me, because I was a kid and I didn\u2019t understand their behavior. They were forever going on and on about how much I looked like my dad, etc., etc. It wasn\u2019t until I was older that I fully understood why we hardly ever saw our extended family.

Well, grandmothers tend to do this. Many grandparents seem to think that the baby is *their* grandchild as much as it is *your* child. You have every right to be upset about that, and your mother needs to accept that you and your partner lay out the rules.\n\nB) You think that your mother does not consider her other grandchildren  *real* grandchildren. Let me give your mother the benefit of the doubt here and say that most of the things she said are technically correct (your child is indeed the first *baby* born into the family). Babies will always get greater affection than older children, that's just biology. But let's assume for a moment that you are right and that you mother somehow actually feels that your child is her first *real* grandchild: Why are YOU the one feeling offended by that? I'd get it if it was your brother who was feeling this way, because it is his family that is treated differently. Why are you the one fighting this fight?", "YTA - seems like you're finding the smallest reason to be pissed off at your mum. She's just excited about the baby! You'd be moaning if she didn't give a shit, like some parents.", "Soft! SOFT! SOOFFFTTT! YTA.\n\nNow, let me make my point here. You are the only one out of your siblings that has had an actual biological baby. That is important to (sadly) a lot of people. Adopting is great. Adopting a baby is the next step down in the child heirarchy. Mainly because, well, it's a baby. But also because it's much easier to bond with a baby for most people. Next up is adopting young children maybe a year or so old. Then older adopted children. Then step children. \n\nHow am I able to rank all these? I've been adopted at an older age (I'll say greater than 1 year of age) and I know others that have been adopted. And I know the difference some people in families have when it comes to adopted kids. Sometimes it's subtle, other times even a 5 year old can understand the situation. I'm not saying your mother is like that, it's just what your post suggests to me.\n\nYour mother sounds like some of my family. It's perfectly fine to plug the child stopgap they have with adopted grandkids but they are then thrown to the kerb when an actual biologically related baby gets introduced into the mix. She didn't have the opportunity to bond with any babies in your family. Yours is the first. And while I feel she is an AH here, so are you. This is your mother and your kids grandmother. While she is super excited to have a baby to fuss over, remember your child is the first one she has had the opportunity to do so with. And while I get and sympathise with you on your stance, still from my perspective you are ever so slightly an AH here. Family is family, whether they are blood or not.\n\nAnd I'll prepare to be downvoted for this, as I can see how this will probably go.", "NAH it might be very uncomfortable but of course it is different to have a biological grandchild that you saw your daughter carry and then meet as a new born compared to one\u2019s that were adopted at 5 and 7. She is being truthful with her feelings and experience. It\u2019s ok for you to ask her not to voice them but to ask her not to feel that was is ridiculous, you can\u2019t police her feelings like that. Maybe instead of being angry and aggressive about it you could be curious about how it feels for her and talk to her about being a grandmother to biological and adopted children. \n\nI agree that she should be more careful about how she expresses her excitement around her grandchildren. But I disagree with you refusing to go to her 60th. It seems like you have a difficult relationship with your mum and you\u2019re using this as a way to get back at her for all the hurt she\u2019s caused you. Really this is more of an issue for your brother, have you even bothered spoken to him about it or just gone in all guns blazing?", "I\u2019m sorry you and your siblings had to go through that", "Well she also said \u201cfirst grand daughter to spoil\u201d so it\u2019s more than just wording.", "Exactly! Regardless of biology, it\u2019s normal for babies to get the most attention in a family. Unless OP\u2019s mom treats the her older grandkids like strangers instead of grandchildren, I don\u2019t see why OP is accusing her of showing preferential treatment towards her daughter.", "Alright, take it from someone that was taken from a horrible system and taken into a family. Just because my immediate family, mother, father, sister accepted me in did not mean that everyone else did. It did not mean that I was not treated differently - mainly by the older members of the extended family. It did not matter that I was not the only person adopted in the extended family and they also found the treatment to be..... variable, to say the least. \n\nPeople are people. And while some, perhaps many will think like you please understand that not everyone will. And when the OP has the only biologically related baby in the immediate family then in many folks eyes that trumps everyone else. It's sad, I do not like it. I DID not like it and it sucks. But people are gonna be people and saying what should be is always gonna lose when it meets what is.", "I love infants a lot. I have for them all the patience i don't have for the rest of the population. Once they're 2-3, i would gladly pass them to you until they're 6-8. \nThat said, it doesn't sit well with me that Mother would insist on gendered crap and denying the status of the adopted grandchildren. It make me mad (with my own mother) when i repeat ad nauseam how a behaviour hurts me and all i get is Pikachu eyes and \"i can never say the right thing\" before repeating the exact same thing again. \nI just don't understand why my generation and younger ones have had to understand (thru trauma, therapy, loss of relationships - not with a walk in the park) how words have meanings and long term consequences while they happily go on insulting people as if it was no big deal, not caring at all until they're shown a consequence - and even then all they see is how they're hurt. Shudder.", "I\u2019m not upset about her being excited over a baby. I completely understand that aspect. I\u2019m upset how she\u2019s talking about it, saying this is her first granddaughter, the first grandchild born in the family. For years she has tried to convince my older sister to have a baby because she wants a grandchild, but which she already had three. \n\nMy niece who\u2019s my age is basically like a sister to me. A soulfriend. My brother\u2019s partner had full custody of her as a child, her mother\u2019s family is not involved with her, and her bio-dad\u2019s parents are deceased. She was really excited to have a grandmother, but, idk, my mom was never into it, she said she was too busy raising me (I was a birth control fail). Certainly my mother has never gone out of her way to be hostile to her, but if she wanted a girly girl then that was her opportunity. \n\nThis was just the last thing that I was willing to deal with, and the lead up to our argument. After we argued I told her I wanted to spend some time away from her for a little while. A few days later she texted about the party. I said I wasn\u2019t going. She never responded. That was all of our communication since then. My sister doesn\u2019t talk to her except occasionally at large family gatherings or holidays. My brother did go with his partner and their two son\u2019s. They don\u2019t come around often, but they do invite my mother to their house and kids sports games, which she never attends.", "That\u2019s some sexist bullshit.
