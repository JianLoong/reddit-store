Well, grandmothers tend to do this. Many grandparents seem to think that the baby is *their* grandchild as much as it is *your* child. You have every right to be upset about that, and your mother needs to accept that you and your partner lay out the rules.\n\nB) You think that your mother does not consider her other grandchildren  *real* grandchildren. Let me give your mother the benefit of the doubt here and say that most of the things she said are technically correct (your child is indeed the first *baby* born into the family). Babies will always get greater affection than older children, that's just biology. But let's assume for a moment that you are right and that you mother somehow actually feels that your child is her first *real* grandchild: Why are YOU the one feeling offended by that? I'd get it if it was your brother who was feeling this way, because it is his family that is treated differently.

Maybe instead of being angry and aggressive about it you could be curious about how it feels for her and talk to her about being a grandmother to biological and adopted children. \n\nI agree that she should be more careful about how she expresses her excitement around her grandchildren. But I disagree with you refusing to go to her 60th. It seems like you have a difficult relationship with your mum and you\u2019re using this as a way to get back at her for all the hurt she\u2019s caused you.

She was really excited to have a grandmother, but, idk, my mom was never into it, she said she was too busy raising me (I was a birth control fail). Certainly my mother has never gone out of her way to be hostile to her, but if she wanted a girly girl then that was her opportunity. \n\nThis was just the last thing that I was willing to deal with, and the lead up to our argument. After we argued I told her I wanted to spend some time away from her for a little while. A few days later she texted about the party. I said I wasn\u2019t going. She never responded. That was all of our communication since then. My sister doesn\u2019t talk to her except occasionally at large family gatherings or holidays.

I try to channel her energy towards toys or things we can use. She loves baby sitting, but one day I found her with the baby in the carrier pointed directly at the giant TV watching cartoon. He was 2 months old. This was tough. I tried to gently ask that we hold off on TV until he\u2019s older. I could see she was hurt, so I apologized later for making her feel bad and emphasized it was just a personal choice and that I understood she was just trying to help.\n\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make is that it\u2019s TOTALLY possible to have a super excited (possibly over enthusiastic) grandma WHO ALSO respects your boundaries and is willing to compromise. \n\nThis does not seem like that. \n\nBut since your mom is apparently manipulating the situation to get other family members in her side, it might be worth doing some mediation to see if the relationship is salvageable.

In fact, in my experience they are the only ones who will be as excited as the new parents as long, if not longer.\n\nWhat it comes down to is that people (even grandparents) want babies. This is cruel to say but the fresher the better. Why do you think the adoption waiting lists are so damn long for application to adopt babies? Why is international baby adoption such a lucrative business? Why are so many kids around the world parked in orphanages and foster homes until they age out? It's because it all boils down to people want babies. Not many can and will open their hearts and homes up to older children.\n\nDo I wish the world were different? Yeah, I do. But we deal with the way the world is not as we wish it was. OP's making her stand, but ultimately as long as these children are loved and provided for with the support they need and want then the larger family (and that includes the OP and OP's mother) are stomping over the childrens lives in an unseemly manner without involving at the very least the childrens parents in this mini cold war.\n\n\\*edit\\* My sympathies, if you couldn't tell lie solely with the brother, the SIL and their children. Not with the OP and not with OP's mother. The children already know their grandmother isn't that emotionally invested in them. There is no way to make her feel anything she doesn't want to. Or have ideal relationships with people because that's what some other person wants. I originally stated that OP was very slightly the AH in this. I've changed my mind. ESH is my new judgement.
