Absolutely not.   You are so far from being the asshole.\n\nInvite your aunt to help in ways that convenience you.

You\u2019re doing him a great service by shielding him from that ableist crazy lady. Yes you are disabled, but that doesn\u2019t mean unable to care for him. You know your limits, and if you feel capable then there\u2019s no issue. It actually sounds like a great thing for both of you.", "NTA. Get a lawyer and make sure you have all of the paperwork done to be his legal guardian.", "NTA. You\u2019re old enough, you have your own place, and you know how to get him the help he needs. Be sure to get things firmed up with him by a formal guardianship or even adoption since your aunt may try for custody.", "Holy shit, OP, you are NTA at all! Your Aunt sounds like the worst possible parent for your brother.  Keep him away from her!", "NTA. Your little brother is really lucky to have you in his life. Don't let your aunt bully you. It sounds like he is in a loving home.", "NTA. You are well able to care for your brother and meet his needs. You also have a good understanding of his current and potential future needs. The fact that your aunt doesn\u2019t believe in autism or mental health shows that she is in no way capable of properly caring for your brother.", "NTA. Your aunt is being ableist af. Disabled people can and do raise children just fine. \n\nYou\u2019re doing a wonderful thing for your brother and for yourself (keeping your family together and advocating for yourself here).

First, I'm very sorry for the loss of your parents and I think you are a very brave person to step up and take care of your brother.

Not believing in autism, does.", "NTA. Fuck your aunt", "NTA. As a neurodivergent person who was raised by a neurodivergent mom, your brother is in the best place he can be. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. Since you are responsible for another person now, please remember to take care of yourself. I have a 7-year-old child. It's a lot of work. If you don't take care of you, you can't take care of him. You have lost both parents and are raising a child. That's a lot.", "NtA Sorry about your parents. You are so young for so many life changes.  I think it's wonderful you are raising your little brother. If he's comfortable with you, he should stay with you.\nHe's had enough trauma.

Call them in advance and maybe explain the situation just in case she does something underhanded", "NTA. You are perfectly capable and suited  to care for your brother. Your aunt is both ignorant and bigoted, and not 'believing' in autism when raising an autistic child is a recipe for neglect and abuse.

I'm not sure if emotionally you would be able to watch this movie at this moment, it may hit to close to home if you aren't in a good place.
