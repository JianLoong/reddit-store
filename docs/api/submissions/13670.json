He's the last one 'in the nest' back at home and while he has a good relationship with his parents, he wanted to do something other than sit at home and occasionally hang out with friends. His older brothers were both either busy or lived too far away during this time to entertain him, so he came to stay with me for weeks at a time. I gave him a key to my place since he was coming and going so often. \n\nChristopher hasn't came by since school started up again but I have seen him with his brothers in that time frame. Also since then, my girlfriend moved in with me.\n\nLast Friday, he stopped by my house after school. Neither me or my girlfriend are off of work when he gets finished with school, so he let himself in and was hanging out in the kitchen while he waited. He sent me a text to let me know he was there, but I hadn't seen it because I was working. My girlfriend ended up getting up home earlier than me, saw Christopher and freaked out. When she finally calmed down enough to actually look at him and listen to what he was saying beyond just forcing him out, she realized he 1. looked just like his brothers, who she has met before, 2. was explaining to her he stayed here over the summer and decidedly DIDN'T break into my place, and 3. looked scared to death of the whole thing.\n\nThe fallout of this whole thing has been my girlfriend not apologizing for scaring a kid, but demanding I \"punish/scold\" him for what he had done. He had texted me to let me know he was coming, and used a key I had given him. He technically hadn't done anything wrong. He's also a pretty slim 16 year old boy who's very sweet. He's not exactly in the business of breaking and entering, or overpowering women, or even thinking of anything in that vein. Most 16 year old boys aren't.\n\nI have refused to scold him or take away his key, and my girlfriend is very angry over the whole thing.

You didn't tell her when she moved in he had a key to the place? She has every right to be angry and scared, though her feelings are misplaced. The kid didn't do anything wrong - you did.", "INFO: how old are you and GF?  \n\n\nWhy should GF apologize for \"scaring a kid\" who was in her house, unbeknownst to her?   \n\n\nWhen did you read the text from the kid?   \n\n\nDid your GF know he had a key to the place you share with your GF?  \n\n\nI can understand that both your GF and the kid are freaked out since she didn't know he'd be there. Unless she knew you had an \"open door\" policy with the kid, YTA, not her or even the kid.", "YTA. This is on you. You should have told her he could pop over.  Of course she would be scared. He could be on drugs, no matter who he looks like. She doesn't know him. You owe her an apology. The only person wrong in this situation is you.", "YTA for not telling her that he had a key, AND for not telling her he was coming over.  This was not only the painfully obvious thing to do for courtesy reasons, but would have avoided this whole thing.  She fucking lives there man, she needs to know who else has access.  You don't live alone anymore.", "YTA. Not for not punishing Christopher, but big time for not telling your gf about him, and huge ah for even thinking of the idea that she owes anyone an apology.  \n\nYou do not care about you gf and I hope she gets out asap. A young woman comes home to find a strange man has invaded her house. For her, at best, this ends in horrific assault and most likely ends in death. And the only person you have any empathy for at all is the man?\n\nYou have no idea what real fear feels like.  It's a feeling almost every female on the planet is very familiar with.  I hope life teaches you what it means.\n\nEdit: Grammer", "YTA, not really for the scare but for the fact that you never told your gf who else had the key to your home. Most people aren't \"in the business of breaking and entering\" but enough are that a tenant deserves to know just who might be able to enter their home at any hour of the day or night. I don't care if he's sweet and slim; neither of those mean anything because she didn't know him. The only apology should be from you to your gf who now has to wonder who else might let themselves into her home.", "YTA, it isn't his fault, its your's. Your gf lives there now too, she should be informed that people that are strangers to her have a key and can come in whenever they want. How about making a 3 way group chat so that she won't get surprised next time?", "The 16 year old boy didn't do anything wrong... your girlfriend didn't do anything wrong... you on the other hand...\n\nShe moves in with you and you never mention that someone else has a key to enter the house?? That's important information. I saw someone else say your girlfriend is directing her anger at the wrong person and I definitely agree. She should be angry at you. And you should apologize to both of them, because you are responsible for this situation happening, and it could have gone worse. She could have called the police on him instead of confronting him and yelling at him.\n\nYTA", "INFO: Did your girlfriend know he had a key? How many other keys have you given out that she may or may not be aware of?", "You're TA, but not for the reason you're asking.\n\nNo, you absolutely shouldn't \"punish\" him, because he didn't do anything wrong. You, on the other hand, did do something wrong - you didn't tell your gf that you gave a key, and rights of free access, to the house that she has since moved in to. That's a pretty big screwup, and it's your fault.\n\nThe asshole in this story is you.\n\nSo YTA, but not for the reason you suggest.", "Hard to answer. You deserve the punishment, not him. Nta for not punishing, YTA for not telling her before she moved in!", "You don\u2019t sound mature enough to be in a relationship.", "Maybe you should have him text your girlfriend when he's coming over.\n\nYTA.  You need to apologize to your girlfriend and the kid for not telling them about the agreement.\n\nBelieve you me,  if I was your girlfriend that kid would either be in the hospital or dead. I would not have given him a chance to explain himself.  \n\nAnd I am a cis-female with no problem destroying some stranger who turned up in my home.", "YTA for not letting your girlfriend know. I\u2019d be freaked out too if I was her. The kid doesn\u2019t need to be punished, but you need to apologize to both of them for creating this situation.", "YTA for not telling her that he had a key and giving her a picture so this wouldn't happen.", "YTA for thinking that he's not a threat for being slim; he could be a wiry strong guy.", "INFO: Did your girlfriend know that he comes by sometimes? That he has in the past, and that he might continue to do so in the future? Did you ask her if this is something she would still be comfortable with happening, since this is now her home, too?", "I mean, NTA for not punishing your friend's little brother for doing something you told him he could do, but it seems that you never told your GF, who now lives with you, that other ppl have a key to your house and might sometimes pop in whenever they feel like it, which is very shitty. Added to that, she's saying she feels uncomfortable with that arrangement, and you've dismissed her. \n\nIf I were her, I'd be hella mad too, but I think she's focusing the wrong person.", "NTA for not punishing your brother. In that, you are correct, he didn't do anything wrong. \n\n**However**, you are an AH for not telling your girlfriend that he has keys to your shared place before this. Since she lives there, she should know who has keys. How is she supposed to feel safe now not knowing who can come and go from where she lives? \n\nIf it were me, my trust in you would be battered, and I would not know if I would be safe in my own house anymore. To me anyways, a house is somewhere safe where you know that random people can't just come in and surprise you with their presence. \n\nImagine if you were in her position, where you come home to see a random person in your house. How safe would you feel?", "YTA.  You are the asshole here.  \n\nThis all happened because you didn't tell your girlfriend that Christopher has a key to your apartment.  \n\nChristopher was scared, and your gf was scared.  I'm sure that encounter sucked for both of them.  The only person who needs to apologize is you (and you should apologize to both of them).\n\nYour gf is off base here, blaming Christopher instead of you.  This whole situation was your fault.", "NTA for not punishing him.\n\nI\u2019d say, you could apologize to your girlfriend for not letting her know you had this arrangement. You should also talk to her about the arrangement if she\u2019s living with you, it\u2019s her home now as well sooooooooooo, she should get a say in who has a key to the house. ( Assuming she\u2019s paying rent and etc and if she\u2019s not work out a system in which Chris texts her as well maybe? )", "NTA and her refusal to have any understanding, especially after knowing all of the facts is questionable at the very least. Why should you scold him when he did everything he was supposed to do?", "YTA for allowing this to happen.", "NTA. although you'll.be YTA if you don't at least make some kind of a compromise with your gf. you don't need to punish the kid or anything, because him coming over is on you. but you should consider apologizing to your gf for not letting her know about someone else with free reign to come and go as they please. \n\nand it doesn't matter how harmless he seems to you, if your gf doesn't know him well enough to trust him with a key, then that's where you need to compromise. she doesn't need to worry about bumping into some dude when coming outta the shower. she would be in the wrong to ban him from the house or anything, but there's nothing wrong with her wanting him to visit only when you're home. \n\nit's her home too.", "NTA\n\nIt is extremely understandable why your gf freaked out. I\u2019m sure it was just something you didn\u2019t think about, but she should have been made aware of who all has keys to the house she lives in. It is not reasonable for her to expect you to punish him for doing nothing wrong.", "This is a close one.  I don't think you were TA for letting him stay with you, and I can see how you missed his text that he was in the house.  Up to the point when your GF got home and chaos ensued, no one was TA.\n\nBUT, you might be the AH because you didn't take the key back after the incident.  Not because you or he did anything wrong, but because your GF should have a say in who has keys to her home.  It seems to me that unlimited access to a home is in the category of \"two yesses.\" Unless you both agree that he (or anyone) should have a key, he should not get a key.  \n\nAlso, your GF was surprised and scared, and you need to acknowledge that those are valid feelings.  You should not diminish her response because he is young or small.  He was still a stranger in her home, and that is a very alarming situation.  \n\nSo, tentative NTA, but you could be the AH if you don't listen to her and respect her wishes.\n\nOh, and absolutely don't ask her to apologize for scaring him. Her reaction was totally reasonable.  You may be the AH for asking her to apologize.", "NTA\n\nI would talk to him a little, explain what happened, that it really scared your GF, etc, and not to do it again, maybe give him the GFs number so he could let her know... then probably let his parents take it from there.\n\nSeems like more of a misunderstanding though than something to \"punish\" him for, not to mention that punishing other people's kids is kinda a grey area.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you scold HIM?  YOU caused this.", "NTA for not \u201cpunishing him\u201d (like what?) he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I\u2019m sure your gf scared the shit out of him too. But you might be the AH for not telling her you have this arrangement with him. She should have known ahead of time", "INFO: Did you ever tell your gf he has a key and comes over alot? Bc if not ofc you're the AH, she would have no idea he's there.", "NTA-ish. I don't think the kid deserves a scolding just because you failed to inform your girlfriend you gave someone access to your house even when you're not home. I guess there's a lesson learned here somewhere, eh?", "NTA for not scolding him since it sounds like he was following pre-established boundaries. But you may want to have a chat with him about expectations going forward so this doesn\u2019t happen again (e.g. giving more more notice, letting both of you know somehow).", "nta", "NTA.\n\nSince you told him he was permitted to enter your house, and he informed you beforehand he was already there, I don't see a problem with what he did.\n\nYou are kinda an AH for not informing your GF that someone other than you 2 had keys to your home, whether you couldn't be bothered or forgot.", "NTA. A lot of people let fear push them directly into anger, which is what I think happened with your girlfriend. But I also suspect she likes to stir up shit, so be careful going forward. Try to have a schedule so that she always knows when he's likely to be there. No surprises! If possible, reduce the occasions where he's in the house before you get home.", "NAH", "NTA for not punishing him (he did absolutely nothing wrong), but a few apologies are in order here, two of them from you. If you had worded your judgement question differently, you\u2019d almost certainly be TA. \n\n1. You owe an apology to your gf for not telling her he had a key at all, and additionally that you missed the message and didn\u2019t give her a heads up that actual day he was there, either of which would have prevented this situation. \n\n2. You owe Christopher an apology for the above and creating a situation where he got freaked out at and accused of something he didn\u2019t do. \n\n3. Your gf owes Christopher an apology because he did everything right and it was your f-up that caused this whole misunderstanding. I acknowledge that it was surely terrifying for her in the moment, but if she can\u2019t see that the fault doesn\u2019t lie with him, she has some larger issues going on. \n\n4. Christopher owes no one anything, but is welcome to say he\u2019s sorry he accidentally scared her. I expect he\u2019s already done that and she\u2019s still set on blaming him when it was your fault.", "Just say you did and don't.\n\nThen she will be happy and he will be fine.\n\nWin/win.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
