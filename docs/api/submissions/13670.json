He's the last one 'in the nest' back at home and while he has a good relationship with his parents, he wanted to do something other than sit at home and occasionally hang out with friends. His older brothers were both either busy or lived too far away during this time to entertain him, so he came to stay with me for weeks at a time. I gave him a key to my place since he was coming and going so often. \n\nChristopher hasn't came by since school started up again but I have seen him with his brothers in that time frame. Also since then, my girlfriend moved in with me.\n\nLast Friday, he stopped by my house after school. Neither me or my girlfriend are off of work when he gets finished with school, so he let himself in and was hanging out in the kitchen while he waited. He sent me a text to let me know he was there, but I hadn't seen it because I was working. My girlfriend ended up getting up home earlier than me, saw Christopher and freaked out. When she finally calmed down enough to actually look at him and listen to what he was saying beyond just forcing him out, she realized he 1. looked just like his brothers, who she has met before, 2. was explaining to her he stayed here over the summer and decidedly DIDN'T break into my place, and 3. looked scared to death of the whole thing.\n\nThe fallout of this whole thing has been my girlfriend not apologizing for scaring a kid, but demanding I \"punish/scold\" him for what he had done. He had texted me to let me know he was coming, and used a key I had given him. He technically hadn't done anything wrong. He's also a pretty slim 16 year old boy who's very sweet. He's not exactly in the business of breaking and entering, or overpowering women, or even thinking of anything in that vein.

You don't live alone anymore.", "YTA. Not for not punishing Christopher, but big time for not telling your gf about him, and huge ah for even thinking of the idea that she owes anyone an apology.  \n\nYou do not care about you gf and I hope she gets out asap. A young woman comes home to find a strange man has invaded her house. For her, at best, this ends in horrific assault and most likely ends in death.

I hope life teaches you what it means.\n\nEdit: Grammer", "YTA, not really for the scare but for the fact that you never told your gf who else had the key to your home. Most people aren't \"in the business of breaking and entering\" but enough are that a tenant deserves to know just who might be able to enter their home at any hour of the day or night. I don't care if he's sweet and slim; neither of those mean anything because she didn't know him. The only apology should be from you to your gf who now has to wonder who else might let themselves into her home.", "YTA, it isn't his fault, its your's.

That's important information. I saw someone else say your girlfriend is directing her anger at the wrong person and I definitely agree. She should be angry at you.

You, on the other hand, did do something wrong - you didn't tell your gf that you gave a key, and rights of free access, to the house that she has since moved in to.

That he has in the past, and that he might continue to do so in the future? Did you ask her if this is something she would still be comfortable with happening, since this is now her home, too?", "I mean, NTA for not punishing your friend's little brother for doing something you told him he could do, but it seems that you never told your GF, who now lives with you, that other ppl have a key to your house and might sometimes pop in whenever they feel like it, which is very shitty. Added to that, she's saying she feels uncomfortable with that arrangement, and you've dismissed her. \n\nIf I were her, I'd be hella mad too, but I think she's focusing the wrong person.", "NTA for not punishing your brother. In that, you are correct, he didn't do anything wrong. \n\n**However**, you are an AH for not telling your girlfriend that he has keys to your shared place before this.

How is she supposed to feel safe now not knowing who can come and go from where she lives? \n\nIf it were me, my trust in you would be battered, and I would not know if I would be safe in my own house anymore.

How safe would you feel?", "YTA.  You are the asshole here.  \n\nThis all happened because you didn't tell your girlfriend that Christopher has a key to your apartment.  \n\nChristopher was scared, and your gf was scared.  I'm sure that encounter sucked for both of them.  The only person who needs to apologize is you (and you should apologize to both of them).\n\nYour gf is off base here, blaming Christopher instead of you.  This whole situation was your fault.", "NTA for not punishing him.\n\nI\u2019d say, you could apologize to your girlfriend for not letting her know you had this arrangement. You should also talk to her about the arrangement if she\u2019s living with you, it\u2019s her home now as well sooooooooooo, she should get a say in who has a key to the house. ( Assuming she\u2019s paying rent and etc and if she\u2019s not work out a system in which Chris texts her as well maybe? )", "NTA and her refusal to have any understanding, especially after knowing all of the facts is questionable at the very least. Why should you scold him when he did everything he was supposed to do?", "YTA for allowing this to happen.", "NTA. although you'll.be YTA if you don't at least make some kind of a compromise with your gf. you don't need to punish the kid or anything, because him coming over is on you. but you should consider apologizing to your gf for not letting her know about someone else with free reign to come and go as they please. \n\nand it doesn't matter how harmless he seems to you, if your gf doesn't know him well enough to trust him with a key, then that's where you need to compromise. she doesn't need to worry about bumping into some dude when coming outta the shower. she would be in the wrong to ban him from the house or anything, but there's nothing wrong with her wanting him to visit only when you're home. \n\nit's her home too.", "NTA\n\nIt is extremely understandable why your gf freaked out. I\u2019m sure it was just something you didn\u2019t think about, but she should have been made aware of who all has keys to the house she lives in. It is not reasonable for her to expect you to punish him for doing nothing wrong.", "This is a close one.  I don't think you were TA for letting him stay with you, and I can see how you missed his text that he was in the house.  Up to the point when your GF got home and chaos ensued, no one was TA.\n\nBUT, you might be the AH because you didn't take the key back after the incident.  Not because you or he did anything wrong, but because your GF should have a say in who has keys to her home.  It seems to me that unlimited access to a home is in the category of \"two yesses.\" Unless you both agree that he (or anyone) should have a key, he should not get a key.  \n\nAlso, your GF was surprised and scared, and you need to acknowledge that those are valid feelings.  You should not diminish her response because he is young or small.  He was still a stranger in her home, and that is a very alarming situation.  \n\nSo, tentative NTA, but you could be the AH if you don't listen to her and respect her wishes.\n\nOh, and absolutely don't ask her to apologize for scaring him. Her reaction was totally reasonable.  You may be the AH for asking her to apologize.", "NTA\n\nI would talk to him a little, explain what happened, that it really scared your GF, etc, and not to do it again, maybe give him the GFs number so he could let her know... then probably let his parents take it from there.\n\nSeems like more of a misunderstanding though than something to \"punish\" him for, not to mention that punishing other people's kids is kinda a grey area.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you scold HIM?  YOU caused this.", "NTA for not \u201cpunishing him\u201d (like what?) he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I\u2019m sure your gf scared the shit out of him too. But you might be the AH for not telling her you have this arrangement with him. She should have known ahead of time", "INFO: Did you ever tell your gf he has a key and comes over alot? Bc if not ofc you're the AH, she would have no idea he's there.", "NTA-ish. I don't think the kid deserves a scolding just because you failed to inform your girlfriend you gave someone access to your house even when you're not home. I guess there's a lesson learned here somewhere, eh?", "NTA for not scolding him since it sounds like he was following pre-established boundaries. But you may want to have a chat with him about expectations going forward so this doesn\u2019t happen again (e.g. giving more more notice, letting both of you know somehow).", "nta", "NTA.\n\nSince you told him he was permitted to enter your house, and he informed you beforehand he was already there, I don't see a problem with what he did.\n\nYou are kinda an AH for not informing your GF that someone other than you 2 had keys to your home, whether you couldn't be bothered or forgot.", "NTA. A lot of people let fear push them directly into anger, which is what I think happened with your girlfriend. But I also suspect she likes to stir up shit, so be careful going forward. Try to have a schedule so that she always knows when he's likely to be there. No surprises! If possible, reduce the occasions where he's in the house before you get home.", "NAH", "NTA for not punishing him (he did absolutely nothing wrong), but a few apologies are in order here, two of them from you. If you had worded your judgement question differently, you\u2019d almost certainly be TA. \n\n1. You owe an apology to your gf for not telling her he had a key at all, and additionally that you missed the message and didn\u2019t give her a heads up that actual day he was there, either of which would have prevented this situation. \n\n2. You owe Christopher an apology for the above and creating a situation where he got freaked out at and accused of something he didn\u2019t do. \n\n3. Your gf owes Christopher an apology because he did everything right and it was your f-up that caused this whole misunderstanding. I acknowledge that it was surely terrifying for her in the moment, but if she can\u2019t see that the fault doesn\u2019t lie with him, she has some larger issues going on. \n\n4. Christopher owes no one anything, but is welcome to say he\u2019s sorry he accidentally scared her. I expect he\u2019s already done that and she\u2019s still set on blaming him when it was your fault.", "Just say you did and don't.\n\nThen she will be happy and he will be fine.\n\nWin/win.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This was a conversation that should have happened before this incident.", "You're lucky he wasn't stabbed or seriously hurt. I hear someone in the house and I'm a woman home alone I'm grabbing a weapon and swinging tbh. Not gonna bother with polite questions", "Yeah\u2026 YTA. You know, and you didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cHey Chris will be coming by today. He has a key, don\u2019t worry\u201d\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter if you thought you\u2019d be home first or not because, as you found out, things change.", "She doesn't owe him an apology, OP. *You* are the one that owed him an apology. \n\nINFO: How long has she been living there and you neglected to shoot a quick text to the kid who randomly pops by that he should start checking in advance before stopping in now that someone else also considers that a private space. You need to work on being a bit more proactive with your communication skills.", "This really really shows how different the world is for men. I would never ever ever forget to mention a guest to a partner because the idea of entering my home to a stranger, is terrifying. And BTW OP women are more often assaulted and killed by acquaintances, so even if you know chris, you dont just not tell a woman if other men have access to the home. \n\nYou owe both of them huge apologies.", "And now you need to ask them to give the keys back and tell them that they're only allowed to come over when it's been arranged in advance with *both* of you.  \n\nBecause it's your girlfriend's home now too, so the previous \"drop in whenever, even if I'm not here\" arrangement  is no longer feasible. YTA if you continue to disrespect your girlfriend by allowing unarranged drop-ins.", "His gf lives with him in his place. He is allowed to give the child a key if he wants", "Tbh if I was the girlfriend I'd be leaving to live somewhere else. I wouldn't be able to cope with staying there.", "Him expecting her to apologize really pushes the whole thing into major asshole territory. The audacity.", "[deleted]", "I have already apologized to him and explained I didn't see his text until I was on my way home. None of this was his fault at all, which is why I'm confused as to why she wants me to give him some sort of lecture.\n\nI forgot he had a key, but I agree, I should've told her this was a possibility. It didn't occur to me previously.", "For real! I was impressed with how restrained OP's GF was. If it had been me, I would be picking up everything I could get my hands on and throwing them. \n\nIt's something that frustrates me to no end; the majority of men that don't realize that women often feel afraid in their own homes. Or think the fear is irrational. \n\nI've run through scenarios in my head. What should I do if a man breaks in and comes for me while in the shower? What would be the best weapon? What would be the best defense? What are the best exit routes out of the house from whatever room I may be in? So on and so forth.", "This. OP doesn't understand the trust she put in OP, in regards to her personal safety, by moving in with him. That trust took a significant blow today, and he will need to prove he understands that this is her home now, too. \n\nAre there any other keys floating around out there? And this includes family, bad way to meet your parents OP. And definitely take the kid's key back.", "I obviously don\u2019t know their exact situation, but if she\u2019s contributing to the household in any way, it becomes her place too. I moved in with my bf in the apartment that he was living in because it was bigger than mine, but once I moved in, it became our place. It would\u2019ve been weird if he referred to it as his place as if I\u2019m just a guest. So from my perspective, since this is now her home too, she should have a say on who can come and go.", "Yes, but \u201cforgetting\u201d doesn\u2019t absolve you of blame when you fuck up. If you fuck up because you forgot, it\u2019s still your fault for fucking up.", "So was Richard Ramirez. Even a slim boy is threatening and scary to a woman, when unexpectedly in her home. \n\nBecause of your negligence, you have a decision - let this boy continue to drop by with his key, or keep your girlfriend. She does not feel comfortable with someone else having the key, which is her right at someone who lives there. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be punishing this kid, no, but your girlfriends reaction was completely justified. And all of it is your fault for not remembering that this person had a key and could drop by whenever.", ">didn't really have much time to warn her in advance.\n\nHow much time did you need for this?\n\nHow busy could you possibly have been that you literally haven't had \"enough time\" to tell her since however long you've lived together?\n\nWhy didn't she know already? How long could this reveal possibly take that you haven't had \"enough time\" to squeeze it in yet?", "You are incredibly naive if you honestly think his age makes him not a potential threat. Even more naive if you think her first response should be to make friends with what she thinks is an intruder in her home. Do you think 16 year olds aren't capable of committing thefts, assaults, rapes, or murder? You may know or believe he wouldn't, but your girlfriend has more brains in her head than to assume an unexpected intruder in her home is her new best friend.", "A kid could still have a weapon. Your girlfriend was 100% justified in her response. YOU owe him and her an apology. This whole mess was your fault. YTA for thinking your girlfriend is in the wrong AT ALL. She was terrified and it's so shitty of you to try to diminish that.", "You're a man and it shows. He may not look scary to you, but to a woman ANY stranger in your home could mean assault or your life.", "your girlfriend was scared by a random person, but since you\u2019ve decided she shouldn\u2019t be, it\u2019s now her fault. how is that fair?", "It wasn\u2019t his fault, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s 100% your fault and you are the only person who owes him an apology.", "Did you apologize to her for not letting her know about another person having access to the house?", "It doesn't have to be a \"lecture\".  It could be .  \n\n*Hey kid, I messed up and didn't think to tell girlfriend about you.  Naturally, this changes things.  You are still welcome to visit, but you'll have to do it when we are home and you will have to knock and be let in*(this is when you reclaim your key).   \n\n\nYour girlfriend has a right to know her privacy is respected and her belongings are safe from someone she doesn't know coming in and out of her(/your) home without her knowing.", "I'd consider it if this was an adult in question but it's not.", "Why would a 16 year old have unlimited privileges in OPs home that he shares with his gf? I guess I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s different just because he\u2019s not an adult yet."]}
