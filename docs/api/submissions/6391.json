She said she gets it because of my childhood but I shouldn't take that out on Bella and Sharon, they didn't do anything.  \n\n I think I was preventing what happened to me from happening to Andy.

The only thing that might be considered a bit problematic is going against what Bella's parent considers acceptable language.  \nYour child is 2 years older! Of course the bedtime is different.  Some kids like playing dolls, some don't. Sigh  \nAlso, isn't it usually up to the hosts to make the guests comfortable?

Your dad and his wife should be working to make you and your son feel comfortable.

Or maybe there should be an agreement of \u201chouse rules\u201d before you go visit that your son has to follow, for instance bed time for kids is at 8. Not communicating these things beforehand is what\u2019s causing the problem.", "NTA your kids your rules her kid her rules", "Ur sperm ur rules\n\nSeriously you can let your kid do whatever he wants no one can say anything against you", "NTA when it comes to the playing games vs. playing with dolls. No kid should be forced to do something they don't want to. Parents are welcome to suggest alternatives, including taking turns choosing an activity. But no means no. Kids can decline to participate.\n\nYMBTA when it comes to screen time. Sounds like you and they needed to talk it through a bit more, but \"max of one hour per day\" probably should have been treated as a house rule, not just a Bella rule.\n\nI think your dad was half right about that. When you're a guest, rules for kids needs to be aligned. They don't have to completely match. But they shouldn't be opposites.", "ESH. I think it depends on the situation. I agree with you that you don\u2019t have to follow their rules just because you\u2019re at their home. Your son is 9, Bella is 7, so obviously there would be a difference even if you did.\n\nI think the screen time thing is fair, even though it can bring you trouble, because kids will try to break their parents rule by saying others are allowed more. It\u2019s going to force your father\u2019s wife to parent more than she would like to, so of course she won\u2019t like that. I also agree with the time to go to sleep, that\u2019s your kid, you do you. Same for the games, if Bella can\u2019t play outside but your son is not interested in what she proposed and wants to do so, he can. He\u2019s not forced to play dolls if he doesn\u2019t want to, Bella\u2019s not forced to play games if she doesn\u2019t want to either.\n\nThe swear world though, I don\u2019t agree with the way you handled it. You can explain to your kid that it\u2019s not a swear but Bella\u2019s mother does not want her daughter to say it and therefore, it\u2019s better if he doesn\u2019t use it around her. If her mother doesn\u2019t want her to use it, it is a swear to Bella and she\u2019s not allowed to say it, period. You shouldn\u2019t try to change that for her. You should just help your son understand that different standards exist for different persons and since you don\u2019t want to involve yourself in Bella\u2019s education, you\u2019ll just pretend it\u2019s one for the few days you\u2019re here. It actually helps your kids adapt in other environments.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to change your whole parenting while you visit, of course. But do so with respect for the choices they do for their kid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't think you'll find a single person that would willingly say-beside Bella's mom, I guess-that dork is a swear word. It's an insult, or a tease, but not a swear word. Now, if Bella's mom wants to discourage her daughter from saying it by calling it a swear word, that's on her, but it's not OP's responsibility to also call it one when it most definitely is not. He's not wrong in telling his son it's not a swear word-saying that is it could be confusing, since a nine year old may already be aware of actual swear words, or at the very least \"childish\" ones (like damn or hell).\n\n\n>That\u2019s why I said it would be better to just drop the word for a few days and explain why.

But dork can also be used affectionately, which may have been Andy's intention.

Not really, but...it does strike me as fairly impolite. Even if you don't think your Dad and his GF deserve that level of consideration, it's a good opportunity to teach Andy about being a considerate guest.\n\nI feel similarly about the swearing thing: you weren't an AH, but I think there are better ways to handle it. There's no hard and fast rule for what is and isn't swearing. I think it's legit to say that you don't consider it a swear (as opposed to stating it as a fact) but I would also say something like \"If Bella's mom says it's a swear word then let's not use it while we're here.\" You don't have to say Sharon's right but you can choose to behave respectfully and encourage your son to do the same.\n\nHere's the thing: you've got a lot of emotional baggage with your Dad and some issues with his GF. I get that and it seems completely warranted. But you have chosen to include these people in your son's life and your son sees the way you treat them. I would recommend asking yourself if you'd want him mirroring your behavior elsewhere, like at the home of a friend of yours. Maybe you'd have no issue with that, only you can tell. But if it does make you uneasy...then I'd tweak your behaviors.\n\nYour Dad and his GF may not deserve your politeness, but your son certainly deserves an example you'd be happy for him to emulate.

Here what OP did is a minor thing over so many over wrongs by the other parents. So we don\u2019t mind it that much. But I still do think that respecting each others parenting should go both ways. You can\u2019t ask for respect you don\u2019t give fully. And it also means that if the parents don\u2019t want their kid using a word for whatever reason it is, you don\u2019t say to the same kid \u00ab\u00a0Oh it\u2019s no big deal\u00a0\u00bb. You only enforce the rules the parents set for them or not get involved at all.", "Okay, I see where you're getting at. I guess I don't see it as undermining the way you do bc it's not like OP is outright saying \"Bella, your mom is wrong,\" and is just being factual about whether a word is a swear word or not, and think the fact that he discourages the kids from using it reinforces the mentality that either way it's a bad word. I think I also can't personally fault OP for being honest with his son bc the message of dork being an unkind thing to say is more important than labeling it a swear word or not. \n\nAnd it's not like I fault Bella's mom for calling it a swear word to make it easier for her daughter to understand it's not a good thing to say, but honestly, I think this was inevitable. At some point, Bella was going to learn that dork is just an insult and not a swear word, and that's the risk you take when labeling a word something it isn't. I don't think it's OP's responsibility to say anything to Bella regarding what her mom told her-it's her mom's responsibility to adapt to new things her daughter learns."]}
