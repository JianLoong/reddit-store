I don't actually see her that way. \n\nMy dad and Sharon have been together a few years.  She acts like she has authority over me  so I never really tried to build any relationship with her or Bella just civility.\n\n My dad  jumped from girlfriend to girlfriend when I was a kid. He always would side with them against me and if they had kids he expected me to be besties with them even if they were significantly younger and we had nothing in common. \n\nMy dad retired and moved hours away when I was in college. \n\n I took Andy out by my dad last week for a few days my wife had work so stayed home.  Andy loves going there because my dad has a big house,  lots of land, and \"toys\" (boat,  atv, snowmobile,  etc.)  \n\n Sharon allows Bella a hour of screen time.  We don't put strict restrictions on Andy,  I mean he can't sit and play video games all day but it's day to day and every situation is different.  \n\nWell Andy said dork, he was talking about some cartoon or something.  Bella said \"my mom said that's a swear word\". Andy looked at me and I said \"it's not nice to call people that but it's not a swear word \". Later my dad said I was undermining Sharon's parenting, I said just because she tells Bella something doesn't mean I have to agree.\n\nThen one of the days we were there it was bad weather.  So we couldn't do much outside. Bella wanted Andy to play with her, he found some games my dad had and asked to play them with her.  It was like Uno, trouble and something else.  \n\nBella wanted to play \"parents\" with her baby doll, he said no. My dad tried convincing him but I cut in and said \"he doesn't have to if he doesn't want to\". Andy and I played a few games of uno and trouble.   Then I let him use my tablet and watch Netflix because I had to do something for work.\n\nSharon said \"that's not right,  Bella already had her screentime and now Andy  gets unlimited screentime when she can't, he should just play with her instead\".  I said \"he doesn't want to play dolls and she doesn't want to play a game\". She said \"there's nothing wrong with a boy playing dolls\". I said \"correct,  and there's nothing wrong with a girl playing games but she doesn't want to do that\". She rolled her eyes and walked away. \n\nBella had to go to bed at 8, and I let Andy stay up til 9:30. \n\nThere was just little stuff like this.\n\nMy dad said \"usually when you're staying at someone's house and they have a kid, the rules for the kids are the same\". \n\nI told my wife. She said she gets it because of my childhood but I shouldn't take that out on Bella and Sharon, they didn't do anything.  \n\n I think I was preventing what happened to me from happening to Andy. Which is also why I don't let him visit my dad without me. \n\nAITA?

But I was usually more relaxed about lots of things when they had a guest. \n\nBUT if their parents were there with them, then I left the parenting to the PARENTS. \n\nNobody should be forced to do things they don't want to do (within reason obviously) so nobody should be trying to make your son play a game he doesn't want to play.

He can't be made to play with Bella if he doesn't want to. I'm a bit worried that you're wife is dismissing your childhood experience as some kind of oversensitivity.\n\nIf both kids have such different rules,I can imagine parents discussing it and compromising - but i can't imagine a mature conversation like that with OP 's dad or Sharon, so that's a moot point.\n\nNTA.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nHer decisions and rules for HER kid have no bearing on YOUR parental choices for YOUR OWN KID.\n\nDad is being an insufferable enabling AH because he doesn't want to upset his GF.

She has no place to say otherwise.", "NTA:  Your kid, you lay out the behavioural expectations for your kid.  The only thing that might be considered a bit problematic is going against what Bella's parent considers acceptable language.  \nYour child is 2 years older! Of course the bedtime is different.  Some kids like playing dolls, some don't. Sigh  \nAlso, isn't it usually up to the hosts to make the guests comfortable? It would have been so much more fun (IMO) for everyone- parents and kids -  to play uno than for the kids to be expected to amuse themselves for hours on end in a snowstorm.", "NTA\n\nYour kid your rules", "NTA\n\nYour kid, your rules. It's not like you were being outlandish with anything, you were just sticking to what you usually do. I have to say I loved seeing how you advocate for your son too, that is great parenting right there.", "NTA.\n\nYou're *guests*, not residents. Your dad and his wife should be working to make you and your son feel comfortable. And the incidents you raised don't show that you're overstepping on their household rules, but that they are not being good hosts.", "NTA maybe Bella shouldn\u2019t have to follow their rules because there is company. Or maybe there should be an agreement of \u201chouse rules\u201d before you go visit that your son has to follow, for instance bed time for kids is at 8. Not communicating these things beforehand is what\u2019s causing the problem.", "NTA your kids your rules her kid her rules", "Ur sperm ur rules\n\nSeriously you can let your kid do whatever he wants no one can say anything against you", "NTA when it comes to the playing games vs. playing with dolls. No kid should be forced to do something they don't want to. Parents are welcome to suggest alternatives, including taking turns choosing an activity. But no means no. Kids can decline to participate.\n\nYMBTA when it comes to screen time. Sounds like you and they needed to talk it through a bit more, but \"max of one hour per day\" probably should have been treated as a house rule, not just a Bella rule.\n\nI think your dad was half right about that. When you're a guest, rules for kids needs to be aligned. They don't have to completely match. But they shouldn't be opposites.", "ESH. I think it depends on the situation. I agree with you that you don\u2019t have to follow their rules just because you\u2019re at their home. Your son is 9, Bella is 7, so obviously there would be a difference even if you did.\n\nI think the screen time thing is fair, even though it can bring you trouble, because kids will try to break their parents rule by saying others are allowed more. It\u2019s going to force your father\u2019s wife to parent more than she would like to, so of course she won\u2019t like that. I also agree with the time to go to sleep, that\u2019s your kid, you do you. Same for the games, if Bella can\u2019t play outside but your son is not interested in what she proposed and wants to do so, he can. He\u2019s not forced to play dolls if he doesn\u2019t want to, Bella\u2019s not forced to play games if she doesn\u2019t want to either.\n\nThe swear world though, I don\u2019t agree with the way you handled it. You can explain to your kid that it\u2019s not a swear but Bella\u2019s mother does not want her daughter to say it and therefore, it\u2019s better if he doesn\u2019t use it around her. If her mother doesn\u2019t want her to use it, it is a swear to Bella and she\u2019s not allowed to say it, period. You shouldn\u2019t try to change that for her. You should just help your son understand that different standards exist for different persons and since you don\u2019t want to involve yourself in Bella\u2019s education, you\u2019ll just pretend it\u2019s one for the few days you\u2019re here. It actually helps your kids adapt in other environments.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to change your whole parenting while you visit, of course. But do so with respect for the choices they do for their kid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
