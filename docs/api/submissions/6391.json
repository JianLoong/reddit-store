The only thing that might be considered a bit problematic is going against what Bella's parent considers acceptable language.  \nYour child is 2 years older! Of course the bedtime is different.  Some kids like playing dolls, some don't. Sigh  \nAlso, isn't it usually up to the hosts to make the guests comfortable?

Your dad and his wife should be working to make you and your son feel comfortable.

Or maybe there should be an agreement of \u201chouse rules\u201d before you go visit that your son has to follow, for instance bed time for kids is at 8. Not communicating these things beforehand is what\u2019s causing the problem.", "NTA your kids your rules her kid her rules", "Ur sperm ur rules\n\nSeriously you can let your kid do whatever he wants no one can say anything against you", "NTA when it comes to the playing games vs. playing with dolls. No kid should be forced to do something they don't want to. Parents are welcome to suggest alternatives, including taking turns choosing an activity. But no means no. Kids can decline to participate.\n\nYMBTA when it comes to screen time. Sounds like you and they needed to talk it through a bit more, but \"max of one hour per day\" probably should have been treated as a house rule, not just a Bella rule.\n\nI think your dad was half right about that. When you're a guest, rules for kids needs to be aligned. They don't have to completely match. But they shouldn't be opposites.", "ESH. I think it depends on the situation. I agree with you that you don\u2019t have to follow their rules just because you\u2019re at their home. Your son is 9, Bella is 7, so obviously there would be a difference even if you did.\n\nI think the screen time thing is fair, even though it can bring you trouble, because kids will try to break their parents rule by saying others are allowed more. It\u2019s going to force your father\u2019s wife to parent more than she would like to, so of course she won\u2019t like that. I also agree with the time to go to sleep, that\u2019s your kid, you do you. Same for the games, if Bella can\u2019t play outside but your son is not interested in what she proposed and wants to do so, he can. He\u2019s not forced to play dolls if he doesn\u2019t want to, Bella\u2019s not forced to play games if she doesn\u2019t want to either.\n\nThe swear world though, I don\u2019t agree with the way you handled it. You can explain to your kid that it\u2019s not a swear but Bella\u2019s mother does not want her daughter to say it and therefore, it\u2019s better if he doesn\u2019t use it around her. If her mother doesn\u2019t want her to use it, it is a swear to Bella and she\u2019s not allowed to say it, period. You shouldn\u2019t try to change that for her. You should just help your son understand that different standards exist for different persons and since you don\u2019t want to involve yourself in Bella\u2019s education, you\u2019ll just pretend it\u2019s one for the few days you\u2019re here. It actually helps your kids adapt in other environments.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to change your whole parenting while you visit, of course. But do so with respect for the choices they do for their kid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP's son isn't his dad's son, so dad doesn't get to decide bedtimes or what the child does or doesn't play.", "the kid's are 2 years apart as well, depending on the maturity of each individual kid that's like light years for some not to mention different interests.", "shoot. missed that!", "LOL! I grew up in old houses & we had to have shoes or slippers so we didn't get splinters. However, My BFF next door had wall-to-wall, so we were expected to take shoes off at her house.\n\nKids are pretty flexible about changes in rules though, in my experience.", "Do you also try to say what an adult like OP does with his own tablet if in your home?", "Ofc not saying that they have to be friends but they are family so I was thinking maybe they can have a middle ground (not dolls or TTG but maybe something like outdoor time or etc) and get to know each other more as they will be seeing each other for many years to come.", "But this isn\u2019t about rules in regards to the living space. If we were talking about things like wearing shoes indoors or playing loud music then yes, she has the right to dictate the rules. But she is not Andy\u2019s parent so no, she doesn\u2019t get to decide any parenting rules like at what time he goes to bed or how much screen-time he gets. If the father wasn\u2019t there and he\u2019d left instructions like \u201cAndy please do what grandpa and Sharon say\u201d that would be different. But he is there and he can and should enforce his own parenting rules.", "I cant imagine a situation with an adult that would remotely relate to this. Apples and oranges.", "And their opinions don't dictate what others do with their electronic devices.", "I agree. Im not saying any of those things. \n\nIm saying. Just like you wouldnt sit and eat infront of a hungry guest. You shouldnt do something that is coveted so much by the kid that cant do it if its easily avoidable. he could do another activity. \n\nThe other parents are ALSO being a bit inflexible and could have made an acception for a movie for both kids. \n\nBoth parents could have budged a little and made a big difference.", "I have never said anyone should be forced to participate. \n\nAll I have said is it should be expected both sides make conscessions where possible. Some things are a hard line. I dont think he should be forced to play with babies or her forced to play games. \n\nI do think giving a kid an ipad infront of a kid that cant have one is like eating in front of a hungry person. Not polite. \n\nThey could have even made something up like a nap and put him in privacy to use it and i wouldnt care. Its just rude to do it infront of the other kid. If they did it this way it would be showing respect for the house rule and still making their own choice.", "Asking for compromise and considerstion of others is not = to parenting someone elses child. Compromise isnt punishment either", "Its not about people parenting each others kids or enforcing rules. It is about being considerate of other people.\n\nRemember I voted ESH because I think both sides are in the wrong. Everyone seems to get why grandparents are wrong which is why Im focusing on Op.\n\nTo me. Giving one kid screen time in front of the other child who cant have it. Is like eating in front of a hungry guest. Op acting like she doesnt understand the issue is being obtuse. Op could have said he was going to nap. Shower. read a book and taken him to a space to do whatever in privacy.. sounds like the house is big enough. Openly handing her kid an ipad when the other kid cant have it is rude.\n\nShe could have also just told her kid to not say dork and discussed the merits of it as an actual cuss word at a later moment in private instead of directly opposing the other parent. \n\nMore of an effort might have been made to find a 3rd option for play but im not saying they HAD to play together.", "Would you bring a big piece of chocolate cake and eat it in front of your friend at their house when they are dieting? \n\nIf the kid got some screen time in private and the other kid didnt know. Whatever. To me. Him using the tablet when she cant and it being a known thing is like eating in front of a hungry guest. Not polite.\n\nMost adults know how to be polite about using their devices. \n\nIf I invited a friend to dinner and they pulled out an ipad and started watching a movie. That would be rude. \n\nJust because you can do what you want. Doesnt mean it is polite.", "She didn't ask for compromise,  and no one gets to tell you what to do with your own possessions like tablets. \n\nWanting to have so much control over others is a sickness.", "Their diet doesn't dictate my diet so yeah, I could eat cake in front of them. Do you demand your friends not eat foods you've chosen not to eat because you're jealous? \n\nHE is the guest, not the other kid, and her parents can simply explain that different parents have different rules. Her parents rules dont dictate his rules. \n\nThey aren't at dinner either, not even close. This is more like you having a friend over, you aren't spending time with them, but you dont want them to do anything to pass the time either. Kid was there to see his grandfather (who was busy during tablet time), not the controlling woman and her brat.", "Omg you are really intent on taking this wrong. \n\nThats why I said ESH because the other person 10000% should have also been compromising here!!! \n\nControl? People can do what they want and they do. Doesnt make it polite. People have loud conversations in public. Im not telling them to stop. It is still rude though. \n\nUsing a device like that infront of another kid that is also cooped up and cant use something like it is taunting. \n\nIf he needed to have \"control over his device\" they could have said he was going to go lay down and nap and he could have used it privately. That is respecting someones wishes while doing what you want. \n\nThis is the type of solution I am talking about. The other parents could have also said. \"hey, special occasion, why dont you guys watch a movie\".", "It isnt about eating cake in front of them. It is about intentionally bringing something that would be very tempting to them and eating it in front of them for the sole purpose of making them want it and not be able to have it. \n\nYou know a kids is really going to have a hard time watching another kid specifically with an ipad when they cant. This is this other childs home. While they need to learn how to accomidate and be kind to guest. They also have no choice with whether or not this person disrupts their space ans deserves consideration. Calling a kid you dont know a brat ... is a choice. Nothing here says the girl behaved badly. Only the mother. \n\nThey could have told a white lie and gave her kid his screen time if it was soooo important he get screentime without creating a situation where the girl was left out. \n\nI didnt say they cant do \"anything\" else but entertain her to pass the time. Merely pointing out that there are other options that would have worked.", "I guess kids staring at screens is really important to everyone. Real important to get that screen time in. How dare anyone suggest the kid do anything else other than the thing that is making an issue and isnt great for him any way.", "They were trying to force OP's kid to play with her daughter which he didn't want to. They are disrespecting OP'S parenting cause theirs is better. The father was not a good father and it's not a good grandpa he was not even spending time with the child.", "I dont know where I said the parents were in the right here... I made my point about op because that is what was directly being addressed. \n\nI dont think the Grandpa/dad/stepmother are without fault.", "And im saying life is easier when you can compromise a bit on silly things. \n\nI dont think either needs to abandon all conviction but a little flexibility on both sides could have just made this a non issue. \n\nI dont understand why cooperating and working with people for a mutually satisfying situation is looked down upon.", "Never did I say that people need to do everything and participate in everything. That is a complete twisting of things. \n\nNever did I say they should not be able to say no. \n\nHe is not there to entertain BUT just like it would be rude to eat without sharing infront of a hungry guest. It is rude to do something that the is such a highly valued but band activity in front of someone. Let the kid read a book. He doesnt have to do the thing that is going to be the hardest for the other child."]}
