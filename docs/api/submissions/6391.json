She said she gets it because of my childhood but I shouldn't take that out on Bella and Sharon, they didn't do anything.  \n\n I think I was preventing what happened to me from happening to Andy.

The only thing that might be considered a bit problematic is going against what Bella's parent considers acceptable language.  \nYour child is 2 years older! Of course the bedtime is different.  Some kids like playing dolls, some don't. Sigh  \nAlso, isn't it usually up to the hosts to make the guests comfortable?

Your dad and his wife should be working to make you and your son feel comfortable.

Or maybe there should be an agreement of \u201chouse rules\u201d before you go visit that your son has to follow, for instance bed time for kids is at 8. Not communicating these things beforehand is what\u2019s causing the problem.", "NTA your kids your rules her kid her rules", "Ur sperm ur rules\n\nSeriously you can let your kid do whatever he wants no one can say anything against you", "NTA when it comes to the playing games vs. playing with dolls. No kid should be forced to do something they don't want to. Parents are welcome to suggest alternatives, including taking turns choosing an activity. But no means no. Kids can decline to participate.\n\nYMBTA when it comes to screen time. Sounds like you and they needed to talk it through a bit more, but \"max of one hour per day\" probably should have been treated as a house rule, not just a Bella rule.\n\nI think your dad was half right about that. When you're a guest, rules for kids needs to be aligned. They don't have to completely match. But they shouldn't be opposites.", "ESH. I think it depends on the situation. I agree with you that you don\u2019t have to follow their rules just because you\u2019re at their home. Your son is 9, Bella is 7, so obviously there would be a difference even if you did.\n\nI think the screen time thing is fair, even though it can bring you trouble, because kids will try to break their parents rule by saying others are allowed more. It\u2019s going to force your father\u2019s wife to parent more than she would like to, so of course she won\u2019t like that. I also agree with the time to go to sleep, that\u2019s your kid, you do you. Same for the games, if Bella can\u2019t play outside but your son is not interested in what she proposed and wants to do so, he can. He\u2019s not forced to play dolls if he doesn\u2019t want to, Bella\u2019s not forced to play games if she doesn\u2019t want to either.\n\nThe swear world though, I don\u2019t agree with the way you handled it. You can explain to your kid that it\u2019s not a swear but Bella\u2019s mother does not want her daughter to say it and therefore, it\u2019s better if he doesn\u2019t use it around her. If her mother doesn\u2019t want her to use it, it is a swear to Bella and she\u2019s not allowed to say it, period. You shouldn\u2019t try to change that for her. You should just help your son understand that different standards exist for different persons and since you don\u2019t want to involve yourself in Bella\u2019s education, you\u2019ll just pretend it\u2019s one for the few days you\u2019re here. It actually helps your kids adapt in other environments.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to change your whole parenting while you visit, of course. But do so with respect for the choices they do for their kid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't think you'll find a single person that would willingly say-beside Bella's mom, I guess-that dork is a swear word. It's an insult, or a tease, but not a swear word. Now, if Bella's mom wants to discourage her daughter from saying it by calling it a swear word, that's on her, but it's not OP's responsibility to also call it one when it most definitely is not. He's not wrong in telling his son it's not a swear word-saying that is it could be confusing, since a nine year old may already be aware of actual swear words, or at the very least \"childish\" ones (like damn or hell).\n\n\n>That\u2019s why I said it would be better to just drop the word for a few days and explain why.

But dork can also be used affectionately, which may have been Andy's intention.

Not really, but...it does strike me as fairly impolite. Even if you don't think your Dad and his GF deserve that level of consideration, it's a good opportunity to teach Andy about being a considerate guest.\n\nI feel similarly about the swearing thing: you weren't an AH, but I think there are better ways to handle it. There's no hard and fast rule for what is and isn't swearing. I think it's legit to say that you don't consider it a swear (as opposed to stating it as a fact) but I would also say something like \"If Bella's mom says it's a swear word then let's not use it while we're here.\" You don't have to say Sharon's right but you can choose to behave respectfully and encourage your son to do the same.\n\nHere's the thing: you've got a lot of emotional baggage with your Dad and some issues with his GF. I get that and it seems completely warranted. But you have chosen to include these people in your son's life and your son sees the way you treat them.

My kids don\u2019t just suddenly have new rules to live by if we\u2019re staying at the same place as other kids and I wouldn\u2019t expect it the other way around either. That\u2019s weird.", "I think the real kicker is that ALL of the accommodations were expected to be made by OP's son and none by Bella. So they are expecting a kid who is two years older and different gender to do all the accommodating? Uh...nope!", "Before just not visiting, I would suggest trying to discuss rules with OP\u2019s dad and GF in advance, and have a strategy going in rather than bickering about it during the visit.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty normal to have different rules at different houses, but usually it\u2019s clarified in advance.\n\nAlso, there are allowed to be age appropriate differences in rules like bedtime.\n\nMaybe visitors limit screen time, during the day, but since the 9yo stays up later because he is older, he can have more screen time before bed.\n\nIf they can\u2019t compromise in advance, then maybe the visits should decrease, but it would be unfortunate to not have a relationship at all just because of lack of communication", "More importantly, why does Andy have to make all the sacrifices?  Andy is older than Bella for once, why should he be going to bed at 8pm?  Stuff that.  If Sharon doesn't like it, she can let Bella stay up to 9:30.", "I definitely agree.  Thank you for pointing that out! Honestly sometimes a situation hits close to home and when only reading about it, you forget to re-read, read between the lines and to use critical thinking.  \n\nThough,  on the other hand, I'd be willing to bet some of the dad saying something is because Sharon said something to him about it in another room. I could be wrong, and making assumptions,  but my best friend has a step mom EXACTLY like this.  (See above for close hitting situations)\n\nI don't know if OP might be trying justifying his actions based on him not liking Sharon, or if he just put that in there because its how he feels. \n\nOP said at the end that his dad used to try and force him to be best friends with any kids of the woman he was dating, and from what is written,  it didn't seem like OP was any more willing to appease his dad than he was Sharon.  \n\nI agree on rules as well, but like I said earlier,  if the parent is there with the kid, I will always defer to the parents and their rules. \nI don't think OP necessarily took anything out on Bella, as OP's son didn't want to play what she was playing,  but his son offered an alternative and Bella didn't want to play that. Neither kid should be forced to play something they don't want, so if there wasn't another game for both kids to play, I don't see the harm in letting them play separately for a while.   There isn't a huge age difference between the kids, but enough that they might not be into the same things anymore,  or maybe never were at all. Plus it sounds like neither of the kids have siblings,  so they're pretty used to entertaining themselves. \nNot that everyone is like this, but when I was a kid, if I had a guest over and we couldn't agree on what to do, it was almost always the guest that would \"win\" that argument. Or my dad would say do what friend wants for a while and then in an hour or so, you guys do what you want. \n\nI did not set out to write this much! Sorry!", "Break what rules? \n\nNot OP's, he was there and enforced his rules. If you watch my kid he'll follow your rules, but you can eff off telling me how to parent my kid without exigent circumstances like abuse.\n\nNTA", "Scouty, asking a 9 year old to follow stricter than normal rules while on vacation doesn't at all seem odd to you? Wrong even?\n\nOf course Sharon wants OP to do this. It saves her the work of parenting,  of explaining to be daughter that different families have different rules and that's Ok, but the 7 yo knows what her rules are and she needs to follow them. It's not easy to deal with a kid whining for screen time while she's watching another kid have screen time, but that's the job. \n\nIf they go to OP'S house will the daughter get to say dork and have more screen time and since it's his house would she expect her daughter to play in whatever way the 9 year old wants? I doubt it. \n\nAt any rate the weird relationship Sharon wants with OP coupled with this makes me wonder if Sharon doesn't have some control issues at the root of all of this. It might be 100% about this and not at all about what's best for either child which would be unfortunate. \n\nOP- NTA it's great to see you be the kind of father who stands up for his kid despite your role model being such a disappointment.", " you definitely did the right thing then lol the entitlement of some people is shocking.", "And the truth is, when you're a guest in someone's home, they *do* have a level of authority over you.

You're the parent, though it may not harm if you consider some of their advice but at the end of the day you make the choice.

You're doing the right think advocating for your son and accepting his boundaries.", "NTA. Andy is YOUR kid, raise him the way you want to. No one has the right to tell you what to do because someone  else has a certain rules that their kids follow. Sharon was the one who gave Bella such rules so she shouldn't have to enforce them on you and Andy and Andy has the right to pick watching tv and playing other games then playing dolls. I get that sometimes children have to be treated equally so no one would feel left out but some people feel differently about that matter and have the right to feel that way.", "NTA if you ask my boys who makes the rules, they will proudly announce \u201cMama does.\u201d They know to be respectful of others\u2019 homes and boundaries, but I make the rules for them in particular.

Sharon never said anything about what he should/shouldn\u2019t do.\n\n\n> Sharon said \"that's not right, Bella already had her screentime and now Andy gets unlimited screentime when she can't,**he should just play with her instead**\".", "\"Hey dad, did you hear Leo's got a new GF already?\"", "Yeah, but that would mean neglecting the age difference between the two. If they were the same age then you would have a better point but OP's kid is older as Bella. It's normal even if they were siblings that the older kid has different rules as the younger kid and thus has more freedom as the younger one.\n\nI think both set of parents could be more flexible, however OP is NTA for keeping to his set of rules for his kid. He's not telling his father and, with lack of a better word, step-mother how to parent her kids, they should also not tell him how to parent his. That's what struck me as the AH move. Telling OP how to parent his kid. Even if it's only for a few hours", "No, freshly whipped!", "NTA", "NTA. \n\n\nThey are not siblings and she is not your mother nor his. She had the freedom to raise her child how she see fits as do you. But perhaps voice this before visiting next time that you will not expect or make your son follow the rules for his step daughter. If they don't like that then I guess your son can visit another time when they are happy with that arrangement.", "Not to mention OP is 32 and dad's girlfriend is in her 40s. She may be closer in age to OP than to her partner.
