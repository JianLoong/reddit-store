In a climate where anything resembling weapons is banned, what was he thinking?", "NTA. You didn't get him suspended. HE got himself suspended with his foolish stunt. As the saying goes - play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "never apologize or feel bad for standing up for yourself! he needs to be reprimanded, you don\u2019t deserve to be bullied like that. he put himself in the position to be suspended. NTA!", "NTA.  You didn't get him suspended, he got himself suspended.", "NTA.  Anyone that says you going to the school to complain about his behavior in an AH.  It's the not doing anything that is leading to teen suicide from kids being bullied and no one protecting them.  Teens are AH and of course people will give you crap for standing up for yourself but you did nothing to feel bad about.  That guy brought it on himself.  \nThe best thing you can do is to take care of yourself.  Love and take care of your physical and metal wellbeing, stand up to any bullying and remind yourself that school is just a blip in your life.  You will leave school grow up and look back at the stupidity of it all.  I found the best revenge is to be your best, be happy & do well for yourself.  Good luck!", "NTA. He went to Fuck Around town, and now he's in Find Outsville.", "NTA \n\nNot only did he brand a razor. Not only did he insult you with the soap. Not only did he body shame you by suggesting you lose weight. But be also sexually harassed you by suggesting you shave because they don't like girls with hair there. \n\nThere are consequences to his many actions.", "You did not get anyone suspended. His own actions got him suspended. He knew or should have known that bring a weapon or razor to school was prohibited. NTA for that.", "NTA times 1000.  This is absolutely on him; he got himself suspended by behaving abusively towards you.  You had every right to report his behaviour.  \n\nAnd, while I'm at it, anyone who tells you that \"you could have handled it better\" is enabling abusive behaviour like his; they are also AHs.", "NTA, he knows he shouldn't have done it but chose to regardless. He is old enough to know better.\n\nYou shouldn't even feel bad about this tbh, he was bullying you and deserves whatever punishment he gets.", "NTA!\n\nYou got a bully suspended. I wish the schools I went to had done more about me being bullied. Instead they turned a blind eye up until I was eventually stabbed walking home from school by one of my bullies. \n\nGood on you for saying something. Maybe the bully will learn a lesson...though I doubt it.", "NTA. I'm a teacher. I can guarantee that this student is guilty of a long list of antics. You did the right thing. There are other teachers and students that are probably thankful that they are getting a break from this guy. I wish more students had your bravery to do what is right. Too often students are afraid to speak up and then terrible behavior continues until it becomes so big and awful that it can't be ignored. It should never get to that point, but does. I can promise you that the people complaining are his friends that are probably equally morally bankrupt..", "NTA. People will gaslight you for speaking up, you did the right thing.", "NTA - you don't deserve to put up with this behaviour. Nobody does. Good work for speaking up", "NTA - He got what he deserved.", "NTA he was the one that did the thing that got him suspender, not you,", "You handled it fine.", "NTA. Of course you aren't. I absolutely hated high school. HATED. Stick it out, study hard, get an education, and I promise, life is better after high school.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t get him suspended- he got himself suspended. And what you did was noble- he could\u2019ve hurt someone with that razor. He got in trouble for having a weapon because he did, in face, have a weapon inside of a school. That\u2019s a very big deal. \n\nDon\u2019t doubt yourself and don\u2019t feel guilty. And reasonable person would\u2019ve told a teacher. It\u2019d be unreasonable NOT to tell an adult at school a lot someone having a razor on school grounds.", "NTA you did nothing wrong", "NTA. The only thing you could have done differently is allow yourself to be bullied. He acted, you responded. If he didn't want the consequence he shouldn't have been a prick.", "Nta he did to himself", "NTA\n\nWhile I think the punishment is too hard as he didn't physically attack you with the razor, it is still his fault to do this crap.", "NTA.  But nobody likes the kid who goes to the school to settle disputes.  Youre not going to make any friends with that approach.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Never feel bad for standing up for yourself. I was bullied a lot in middle school and it\u2019s never easy to stand up for yourself but he is responsible for what he does. He bullied you and brought a razor to school. You did what you needed to protect yourself. He got what he deserved.", "NTA. School can be really tough. Im very glad you stood up for yourself; this skill will serve you well in life. Try not to let this experience hurt too much.", "You did very well. You were not the first nor last for him to target. Hold your head up !!!", "NTA for telling a teacher about the boy bullying you. His behaviour was mean and disgraceful. He got himself suspended. NTA", "Nta . The boy decided to be nasty and it was uncalled for", "NTA - He learned a lesson.", "F them.  You were protecting yourself from a bully who had a dangerous weapon.  Yes I consider someone with a razor as a weapon.  Watch any prison movie.\n\nTell whoever is being an assdick that next time you will point this bully to them to threaten them and see how they would react/respond.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Do NOT allow them to make you feel guilty for speaking out and standing up for yourself.  Good for you for doing that. You deserve to go to school in peace, without worrying about being harassed and bullied.", "NTA, he should\u2019ve been suspended for the comments alone! He\u2019s the one who did this, not you.", "NTA\nYou stood up for yourself.\n\nYou did community service by getting a bully disciplined because it warms the other kids bullying isn't tolerated.\n\nAnd it show anyone speaking up will be heard.", "NTA. He got himself suspended, you didn't. He's a bully. Fuck around and find out.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.", "girl no NTA at all. anybody who tells u otherwise is just a moron. maybe he should\u2019ve minded his own damn business LOL.", "Info\n\nHow did you figure out his name to turn him in?", "There's definitely 'social repercussions,' but you didn't do the wrong thing OP.\n\n\\*Idk what he gets out of saying that, or going out of his way to do that?

In the workplace, as adults, we would encourage the person to speak to a manager or HR.", "Why would she want any friends who would have a problem with what she did? They sound like AHs to me.", "Yeah, that school learned quickly they need to do better. My mom blasted them on the news and in the newspaper.\n\nI hope your school continues to watch out for you. Nice to see these days.", "\"blame you, villainize you, make you feel like you're the bad guy\" etc. so many other ways to say it, and you're so right", "Making someone feel awful or bad about themselves just because they stood up for themselves should be considered a form of gaslighting.", "She\u2019s not in a workplace.  Sexually harassed?  I don\u2019t think so.  He publicly mocked and humiliated her.  He didn\u2019t want to have sex with her.", "People at that age are AHs.", "Good to hear", "Regardless of if you think it \u201cshould be\u201d gaslighting, it isn\u2019t."]}
