In a climate where anything resembling weapons is banned, what was he thinking?", "NTA. You didn't get him suspended. HE got himself suspended with his foolish stunt. As the saying goes - play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "never apologize or feel bad for standing up for yourself! he needs to be reprimanded, you don\u2019t deserve to be bullied like that. he put himself in the position to be suspended. NTA!", "NTA.  You didn't get him suspended, he got himself suspended.", "NTA.  Anyone that says you going to the school to complain about his behavior in an AH.  It's the not doing anything that is leading to teen suicide from kids being bullied and no one protecting them.  Teens are AH and of course people will give you crap for standing up for yourself but you did nothing to feel bad about.  That guy brought it on himself.  \nThe best thing you can do is to take care of yourself.  Love and take care of your physical and metal wellbeing, stand up to any bullying and remind yourself that school is just a blip in your life.  You will leave school grow up and look back at the stupidity of it all.  I found the best revenge is to be your best, be happy & do well for yourself.  Good luck!", "NTA. He went to Fuck Around town, and now he's in Find Outsville.", "NTA \n\nNot only did he brand a razor. Not only did he insult you with the soap. Not only did he body shame you by suggesting you lose weight. But be also sexually harassed you by suggesting you shave because they don't like girls with hair there. \n\nThere are consequences to his many actions.", "You did not get anyone suspended. His own actions got him suspended. He knew or should have known that bring a weapon or razor to school was prohibited. NTA for that.", "NTA times 1000.  This is absolutely on him; he got himself suspended by behaving abusively towards you.  You had every right to report his behaviour.  \n\nAnd, while I'm at it, anyone who tells you that \"you could have handled it better\" is enabling abusive behaviour like his; they are also AHs.", "NTA, he knows he shouldn't have done it but chose to regardless. He is old enough to know better.\n\nYou shouldn't even feel bad about this tbh, he was bullying you and deserves whatever punishment he gets.", "NTA!\n\nYou got a bully suspended. I wish the schools I went to had done more about me being bullied. Instead they turned a blind eye up until I was eventually stabbed walking home from school by one of my bullies. \n\nGood on you for saying something. Maybe the bully will learn a lesson...though I doubt it.", "NTA. I'm a teacher. I can guarantee that this student is guilty of a long list of antics. You did the right thing. There are other teachers and students that are probably thankful that they are getting a break from this guy. I wish more students had your bravery to do what is right. Too often students are afraid to speak up and then terrible behavior continues until it becomes so big and awful that it can't be ignored. It should never get to that point, but does. I can promise you that the people complaining are his friends that are probably equally morally bankrupt..", "NTA. People will gaslight you for speaking up, you did the right thing.", "NTA - you don't deserve to put up with this behaviour. Nobody does. Good work for speaking up", "NTA - He got what he deserved.", "NTA he was the one that did the thing that got him suspender, not you,", "You handled it fine.", "NTA. Of course you aren't. I absolutely hated high school. HATED. Stick it out, study hard, get an education, and I promise, life is better after high school.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t get him suspended- he got himself suspended. And what you did was noble- he could\u2019ve hurt someone with that razor. He got in trouble for having a weapon because he did, in face, have a weapon inside of a school. That\u2019s a very big deal. \n\nDon\u2019t doubt yourself and don\u2019t feel guilty. And reasonable person would\u2019ve told a teacher. It\u2019d be unreasonable NOT to tell an adult at school a lot someone having a razor on school grounds.", "NTA you did nothing wrong", "NTA. The only thing you could have done differently is allow yourself to be bullied. He acted, you responded. If he didn't want the consequence he shouldn't have been a prick.", "Nta he did to himself", "NTA\n\nWhile I think the punishment is too hard as he didn't physically attack you with the razor, it is still his fault to do this crap.", "NTA.

The boy decided to be nasty and it was uncalled for", "NTA - He learned a lesson.", "F them.  You were protecting yourself from a bully who had a dangerous weapon.  Yes I consider someone with a razor as a weapon.

NTA of course, he sucks massively, he was trying to embarrass you but he honestly only embarrassed himself. You handled it perfectly.", "You did great!!!!!", "NTA. You did the right thing by standing up for yourself in an abusive situation. This is entirely his fault, and he should pay the consequences. By doing the right thing, you may be helping to protect others from experiencing the same type of abuse. Please remember that people lie when they are being abusive. It's obvious from your concern for him that you have a good heart. I have a feeling that he finds you attractive as well. Your amazing character is the best part of you, so continue to spread your goodness in this world. \ud83d\udc96", "NTA, I hope you see this,  he got himself in trouble not you and I really hope that you stop putting yourself down compared to other females your age.  We are all beautiful in our own right,  I didn't figure that out for too many years and I would really hate to see you do the same.  Also so so many people actually like someone with a little weight on,  when you're a teenager they usually hide it because of the other boys but not as adults.", "NTA.

You did exactly the right thing.", ">everyone I talk to is saying that I could have handled it better and now I\u2019m starting to feel bad\n\n*Who* is saying this to you? They are WRONG. What the hell. That's unacceptable for anyone to say that to you. That mindset is simply perpetuating r*** culture. \n\nYou were sexually harassed by a male stranger. With something that could be used as a weapon. There is a *reason* you can't take razors on a plane!\n\nYou. Were. Sexually. Harassed. With. A. Weapon.\n\n*THAT* is why the police were called. He was an utter moron who may not have known the weight of what he was doing. He deserved to be suspended, with or without the razor. What he did was creepy and inappropriate on several levels.\n\nYou are absolutely unequivocally not the AH. Don't ever feel bad for sticking up for yourself. Hold your head high, and the next person who gives you trouble for \"nOt HaNdlIng iT wEll\", look them in the eye and just state, \" he sexually harassed me with a weapon\" and just reiterate that point each time.\n\nKeep your head up, sweetie. NTA x1000", "You are not responsible for his actions or the consequences of his actions.\n\nAll you did was eat lunch and tell the truth.\n\nNTA\n\nAlso this could be the best possible outcome for him too.  He needs to learn this isn't acceptable behavior now, before it escalates as an adult and he ends up doing something even worse to another woman.\n\nDon't accept an ounce of blame for this.", "NTA and you did the right thing. He got what he deserved.", "Nta, little homie, bullying sucks especially when you have no friends and no one to relate/talk to.

That boy was horrible to you and deserved to get in trouble for being so cruel.  When I was in the 7th or 8th grade some boy put his hand on my bare leg, I went to Catholic school and had to wear a skirt as a part of my uniform, and he told me my leg was really hairy.  I decided to shave and never having done it before, I ended up cutting up my legs badly.  Looking back, I should have told that boy to keep his hands to himself.", "OP , this guy is one sick fellow. . YOU are NOT responsible for his punishment.

High school is rough but sounds like you\u2019re doing the right stuff. Keep kicking ass!", "NTA\n\nYou told a teacher about the bullying/gross comments + props.\n\nThe school then made the decision to suspend the student. \n\nYou didn't lie or exaggerate the situation.

You didn\u2019t deserve that. \n\nHe made his bed, now he has to sleep in it. That\u2019s neither your problem nor your business.", "That's awesome! Just want to add, as a guy at age 37 and is still dealing with acne. You will still find people who are attracted to you and will love you.  Be yourself, enjoy life, and don't let haters bring you down!", "They would gaslight her if they said he didn't approached her with a soap and a razor and that she invented this to bring attention for herself.", "He referred to her genitals. School is the workplace for a child.", "Sexual harassment- behavior characterized by the making of unwelcome and inappropriate sexual remarks or physical advances in a workplace or other professional or social situation.\n\nLiterally a 2 second google search. You don\u2019t have to be at work to be sexually harassed.", "Actually he said he would have sex with her if she shaved her pubic hair, so it was definitely sexual harassement.   \nMaybe you should think more about it and your POV, to avoid doing it in the future.", "Nope.  School is school.  It is not a workplace."]}
