The dog is semi approaching me but its still probably 100 yards away, I'd guess 50 pounds, no idea what breed.  The guy starts yelling at me asking if I can grab his dog for him.   I act like I don't hear him and keep running.  I hear him frantically trying to get the dog to come back and he is trying to catch it.  I just keep running and eventually get away from what was going on.  \n\nAbout a dozen times i've been chased by dogs in my neighborhood over the 10 years i've lived here.  I don't enjoy this experience and early on living in the neighborhood even had an owner blame me because I caused his dog to react as I ran by that house. I've had to jump in the beds of strange pick ups to get away a few time.  So i'm not much of a fan of the dogs (or owners) in my neighborhood after these experiences.  \n\nAs I circle back around to where the loose dog situation was I see the owner still out looking.  He sees me and he is angry and stops me.   He says he can't find his dog and have I seen it?  I say I haven't seen it since the last time I ran by.  He mentions he asked me to grab it since it was headed my way.  I respond with \"sorry man, i'm not grabbing a strange dog.  I don't know what its going to do to me\".  He's mad with that answer so I leave and continue my run.  I get about a quarter mile away and I see his dog.  Its approaching a lady walking her dogs. I even here her \"oh, where is your owner\".

You don\u2019t wanna grab the dog fine, but accidents happen and dogs can get loose unintentionally. You literally went out of your way NOT to help someone, that\u2019s messed up.", "NTA this dog is not your problem. I don\u2019t go anywhere near unleashed dogs. I don\u2019t care what their owner is saying. Sure OP heard them and heard them ask where they went, what are the supposed to do chase them around and risk getting bit? Nope nope nope they are the bad dog owner it is not the responsibility of everyone who happens to be on the street to keep tabs on their out of control dog. The owner needs to do better", "NTA. Not your job", "NTA, not your problem. If he's a responsible dog owner, he'd take responsibility for controlling his dog. There would also be a dog tag with name and contact information.", "Yep. Very selfish. It's fair, I guess, not to try to help him catch his dog initially. But by not telling the other woman, you hurt her, because it sounds like if she catches the dog, she's going to try to find the owner. You could have saved her a lot of hassle by just telling her. If she doesn't catch the dog, she made it less likely that the owner will catch his dog in a timely fashion, increasing the risk that the dog will get hit. This obviously would hurt the dog and the driver.", "Fuck no. Control your fucking dog. If it gets out it's your fault and it's nobody's responsibility but your own to find it.", "Agreed\u2026. How hard would it be to yell to the lady, \u201cHey, I saw a guy looking for his dog about a block back. Maybe that\u2019s his!\u201d", "Looking for a dog that's running away is different than when a dog is running at you, though. I think it's normal not to want to intercept a strange dog running at you. Ignoring the neighbor and walking by without helping later in was an AH move though.", "Ehhh I think people are way too hard on people who don\u2019t absolutely adore dogs. She has had multiple bad experiences with dogs, I do not blame her for not being willing to run up and try catching a random dog who could turn aggressive. She definitely sucks for not telling that woman where the owner was though.", "And a responsible owner has tags on his dog in case the dog lets loose. Making a woman feel uncomfortable in public by approaching her isn't being an asshole.", "My feeling was more that OP was an AH for not extending much empathy to a neighbor in distress.  She was just annoyed by him asking for help to the extent that she didn't even tell the woman she knew the owner.   Even if a person doesn't care for dogs, the \"fuck this guy\" response to his request is pretty a-holey."]}
