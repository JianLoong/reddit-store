I've got a lap down in my neighborhood that is pretty much a perfect mile so often times I run this so I know how far i've run.  This morning down a side street I notice a guy chasing a dog.  The dog is semi approaching me but its still probably 100 yards away, I'd guess 50 pounds, no idea what breed.  The guy starts yelling at me asking if I can grab his dog for him.   I act like I don't hear him and keep running.  I hear him frantically trying to get the dog to come back and he is trying to catch it.  I just keep running and eventually get away from what was going on.  \n\nAbout a dozen times i've been chased by dogs in my neighborhood over the 10 years i've lived here.  I don't enjoy this experience and early on living in the neighborhood even had an owner blame me because I caused his dog to react as I ran by that house. I've had to jump in the beds of strange pick ups to get away a few time.  So i'm not much of a fan of the dogs (or owners) in my neighborhood after these experiences.  \n\nAs I circle back around to where the loose dog situation was I see the owner still out looking.  He sees me and he is angry and stops me.   He says he can't find his dog and have I seen it?  I say I haven't seen it since the last time I ran by.  He mentions he asked me to grab it since it was headed my way.  I respond with \"sorry man, i'm not grabbing a strange dog.  I don't know what its going to do to me\".  He's mad with that answer so I leave and continue my run.  I get about a quarter mile away and I see his dog.  Its approaching a lady walking her dogs. I even here her \"oh, where is your owner\".  I say nothing and run home.

You went out of your way NOT to help someone, so I hope you never expect a stranger to do anything nice for you, ever. Of course it's not your dog, and there are a bunch of people on Reddit who have never lived in the real world who will tell you that you aren't obligated to help anyone, ever. But, honestly, it's a dick move to not even TRY, and to pretend like you don't hear the guy at all. Then when you actually saw the lost dog you didn't even say a thing?

You *don\u2019t* know how a strange dog is going to react if you try to grab it. I\u2019ve been attacked by dogs twice that got off leash or loose and I wouldn\u2019t even think of it.

Or bit you? If you aren't a dog person, you are totally right in your apprehension of not wanting to touch or catch a stranger's running dog.

If you don't like dogs then you shouldn't be expected to grab a loose dog. But you could have told the old lady that the dogs owner was looking for him when you saw it again. That would have cost you nothing.", "NTA.\n\nIt is always the owner's responsibility to keep control of their dog.  If it jumped the fence or ran out the front door or yanked free of the leash, that's all on the owner for not controlling their dog.\n\nEven if you weren't busy with your exercise, and you knew the dog wouldn't bite, you're not AH for declining to help, any more than he would be an AH for declining to help you weed your flower bed.", "Why are you here?

You could have done better there.", "NTA.\n\nIt's understandable that you've had some bad experiences with dogs in your neighborhood and it's your personal choice to not want to interact with a dog you don't know.

This still keeps the dog in one place, and it may be less interested in running away from its owner if it\u2019s feeling uncertain.  \n\nIf it actually lunges for you, all bets are off, defend yourself - but if you live in this neighborhood and don\u2019t already know this dog as *that asshole dog that\u2019s going to take somebody\u2019s arm off some day*, it\u2019s probably not going to do that.
