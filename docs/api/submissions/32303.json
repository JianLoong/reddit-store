This is important because it turned us into who we are today and will help you better understand the issues in this post.\n  I watched several of my siblings face really bad methamphetamine addiction. When I was 3 my second oldest nephew (David) was born and placed with me and my parents (his grandparents) for years. My sister (33 att) was finally sober and capable of taking care of him so he moved back with her (he was 10 att). After a few years my sister had a few more kids and now has 5 that live with her(7 in total) no father figure and they all have different fathers that aren\u2019t there very much aside from the two that don\u2019t live with her.\n After seeming to be sober since getting David back, my sister started disappearing for days on end again, I wasn\u2019t old enough to recognize this behavior when she was previously using, but now I knew what she was doing. She would usually leave David to watch the rest of the kids while she went on benders, my parents were totally oblivious to what was happening, either that or they just didn\u2019t want to believe it was happening again.\n  Well me? Oh I was pissed, for starters you don\u2019t sign your 13 year old up to watch all his younger siblings by himself and take care of the house especially when there are 4 ranging from newborn to 8 years old. The next thing was the fact that she couldn\u2019t even bother texting anyone back to let us know she is even alive. I was livid at the fact that she just left them all alone, I would actually walk there (about 5 miles) to go help watch the kids and make them food and then eventually got my license and was taking them to school and everything. \n  I drew the line when she asked me to borrow her money to pay her electric bills (meaning she was behind). I stopped going over there and helping with the kids and instead I called CPS, which is child protective services, and told them everything. The children were to live at my parents house while my sister goes to meetings and treatment. She also was placed on a no contact with multiple people in the county that were believed to be providing these drugs and was put on probation.\n  My sister didn\u2019t get to see her kids for about five months including holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas. Eventually she did get clean again and got them back but she is still pissed at me for reporting her, I truly don\u2019t believe I am wrong for this, especially after she lost custody of two other kids for her addiction previously.\n  (She is 39 now, sober and has custody of 7/8 kids, she got custody of her first born child after this entire ordeal, he is now 18 and moved out, the 12 y/o is now 16 and is in therapy and anger management.)", "created_utc": 1701648093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18a7930/aita_for_reporting_my_sister_to_cps_and_getting/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lot of adults ignore the signs of abuse and neglect because it would be uncomfortable to deal with but you were more mature then any of them.
