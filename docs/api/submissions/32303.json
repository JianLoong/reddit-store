This is important because it turned us into who we are today and will help you better understand the issues in this post.\n  I watched several of my siblings face really bad methamphetamine addiction. When I was 3 my second oldest nephew (David) was born and placed with me and my parents (his grandparents) for years. My sister (33 att) was finally sober and capable of taking care of him so he moved back with her (he was 10 att). After a few years my sister had a few more kids and now has 5 that live with her(7 in total) no father figure and they all have different fathers that aren\u2019t there very much aside from the two that don\u2019t live with her.\n After seeming to be sober since getting David back, my sister started disappearing for days on end again, I wasn\u2019t old enough to recognize this behavior when she was previously using, but now I knew what she was doing. She would usually leave David to watch the rest of the kids while she went on benders, my parents were totally oblivious to what was happening, either that or they just didn\u2019t want to believe it was happening again.\n  Well me? Oh I was pissed, for starters you don\u2019t sign your 13 year old up to watch all his younger siblings by himself and take care of the house especially when there are 4 ranging from newborn to 8 years old. The next thing was the fact that she couldn\u2019t even bother texting anyone back to let us know she is even alive. I was livid at the fact that she just left them all alone, I would actually walk there (about 5 miles) to go help watch the kids and make them food and then eventually got my license and was taking them to school and everything. \n  I drew the line when she asked me to borrow her money to pay her electric bills (meaning she was behind). I stopped going over there and helping with the kids and instead I called CPS, which is child protective services, and told them everything. The children were to live at my parents house while my sister goes to meetings and treatment. She also was placed on a no contact with multiple people in the county that were believed to be providing these drugs and was put on probation.\n  My sister didn\u2019t get to see her kids for about five months including holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas. Eventually she did get clean again and got them back but she is still pissed at me for reporting her, I truly don\u2019t believe I am wrong for this, especially after she lost custody of two other kids for her addiction previously.\n  (She is 39 now, sober and has custody of 7/8 kids, she got custody of her first born child after this entire ordeal, he is now 18 and moved out, the 12 y/o is now 16 and is in therapy and anger management.)", "created_utc": 1701648093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18a7930/aita_for_reporting_my_sister_to_cps_and_getting/", "score": 566, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is gross.", "NTA hope for the best but plan for the worst because this seems like a nightmare/merry-go-round.", "NTA\n\nThose kids needed being taken away. She should be grateful that you gave her the incentive she needed to straighten up her life.", "NTA \n\nAnd tell her you'll keep call CPS every time you find out she's using.", "NTA you did the right thing. When you are older, if you can, hive your nephew a spare bedroom when he turns 18. Encourage him to go to college & help him escape being forced into the parent position.", "That\u2019s something I never got to hear growing up, thank you for your gratitude it means a lot and I\u2019m glad there\u2019s people like us who look out for these children and protect them no matter who they are or where they come from.", "Sweetheart you probably saved those kids. You stepped up when no one else did. You are the hero here. Don\u2019t let anyone ever take that away from you. It is very possible something very bad could have happened to them and you wouldn\u2019t have had your sisters kids existing anymore. \n\nYour sister is only still angry because she can\u2019t take how badly she messed up and it was so bad that her children needed protection from her. \n\nThank you for protecting those who couldn\u2019t protect themselves. You are the hero who does wear a cape.", "You did the right thing. A lot of adults ignore the signs of abuse and neglect because it would be uncomfortable to deal with but you were more mature then any of them. I\u2019m sorry you had to take on so much responsibility, make sure to take care of yourself too", "> Eventually she did get clean again and got them back but she is still pissed at me for reporting her\n\nThat's...um...concerning, I think is the word? She's clean, sober, and has custody of 7 of her kids, but resents you for getting her there? That's...wow. Okay. Almost sounds like someone preferred being an addict. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nDont let anyone ever tell you what you did was wrong. YOU SAVED THEIR LIVES. I guarantee that without a doubt something horrific would have happened and it would have driven your sister to a severe drug addiction. You were the catalyst for your sister getting sober and getting her kids back. \n\nYou did a brave and amazing job.", "NTA sounds like you calling CPS is what kicked her butt back to where it needed to be. She can be mad all she wants but you did the right thing.", "You did the right thing. Your sister's actions towards her children is/was abusive. She's the adult, she can be pissed all she wants.  \n\nThose children needed a protector which you provided. You walked 5 miles to take care of your nieces and nephews - that's what a mother does and you're not the mother. You showed those children they are loved and they are worthy.  You gave them a roll model. You got both the kids and your sister the help they needed. You helped to pull the family back together.  What you did is amazing. \n\nIf your sister is embarrassed,  that's on her.  She's old enough to know better, especially because of her background. \n\nThey have birth control injections that's good for several months. Suggest your sister get it.  She has more children than she can handle and she's having a hard time dealing with the stress. She needs therapy herself to learn coping mechanisms. She should also look into what aid is available to her.\n\nYou can't put your life on hold,  but you can continue be a part of the kids lives. With cellphone they can always be in touch.  Depending on what college or trade school you go to,  you can make time on the weekends to visit with them. See how they are doing etc. \n\nWalmart has cheap cellphones and come with wifi. There are apps that use wifi for calling and texting. The kids can stay in touch with you and you with them. \n\nNTA.... not in any way are you the jerk. You were the adult in this situation and the kids guardian angel.", "NTA, and good for you for being a good aunt.", "Nta\n\nYou did good, dear!", "NTA She was neglecting her kids and setting them up for lifelong emotional problems. Of course you did the right thing.", "Honestly, who cares if *your sister the addict* is angry? Your nieces and nephews will be eternally grateful for your help as they get older.\n\nMy households were terrible and I wish just *one* of my 11 uncles and aunts had called CPS long before a neighbor did at 16. My life would have been spared the trauma of almost a decade and a half of abuse and neglect.\n\nNTA, and it\u2019s not even close. You\u2019re the hero.", "\n\n\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc5\n\nThis is all I can give you, and you deserve so much more. \n\nGenuine effing hero. \n\nNTA.", "You are a good person", "You're NTA, you did what you could to save your sister's children.", "She should be jailed for safety of those poor kids. Disgusting trash", "NTA. But she will never be okay.", ">> \"my sister had a few more kids and now has 5 that live with her(7 in total) no father figure and they all have different fathers\"\n\nNTA.  If such behavior is normalized and protected (or even rewarded in some ways), then nothing should surprise us.", "NTA but I would be concerned that she still doesnt see that she did anything wrong and blames YOU instead of placing the blame squarely where it belongs ON HER", "NTA she\u2019s only mad at you since you calling CPS and getting her kids removed proved to her that\u2019s she\u2019s a shitty mother. That shame and self loathing is being directed towards you as anger since you forced her to face her failings.", "NTA, but also, I want you to understand that CPS doesn't just roll up to a house and instantly grab the kids, especially for a single report/call. CPS will first investigate, then they do a home visit, talk to the children and neighbors, and there's a tonne of paperwork and even communications with a judge or court for the order to move the children. (Unless the children are in immediate, physical danger.) \n\nThese are professionals, and they truly won't remove children unless their professional opinions say that there's no other way to keep the children safe or cared for. If they moved the children, then please believe that those children *NEEDED* to be moved. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.  Don't let anyone guilt you or make you feel like shit for simply calling attention to a problem. And they didn\u2019t even totally remove the children, nor did they remand your sister. They're with family, she can still see them, and she has a chance to fix the problem and get them back. If she fails to do so, then that's her own fault.", "Yeah it sounds like this woman is no where near ready to have her children back. NTA", "The same Christmas they had to spend with me and my parents, (I would have been 16 around this time) I worked at Dairy Queen making minimum wage for two years with only a 50 cent raise, I scraped my change together and bought a couple of tablets and set the children up on Facebook for kids so that they can video chat, call or text me any time, and I gave the older ones my old phone and found a cheap data plan as well as had my grandpa hook them up with wifi. That christmas, the older children found a new sense of hope and started confiding in me, the younger ones call me all the time to talk about some game they downloaded or a book they read in class, I feel as though I have successfully fulfilled the aunty roll. Ever since that Christmas these kids have gotten all they could ask for, not only from me but also from their mom finally.", "I feel that, abuse is being hidden a lot more these days, kids fear that if they tell someone, the parents get questioned and then it\u2019s let go, then the kids go back to getting beat but worse because the parents know they snitched, at least that\u2019s what happened with my father. I hope that you have found a way to live happily and provide a safe environment for your future kids and even maybe their friends if they are struggling. It\u2019s hard asf to escape/survive abuse with minimal damage done the only reason I\u2019m mentally okay is because I was observant and didn\u2019t speak but when it came down to it, I protected.", "Maybe not, but all we can do is be patient and there for her, and she may be mad at me but she is my sister and that\u2019s forever so I think she had to deal with it lol.", "I believe that she is still recovering and probably in hopes of being able to use again, but I\u2019m watching and always will be, I am Batman. Haha but in reality it\u2019s hard to battle sobriety and i can understand that, I would say that any addict will blame everyone and everything besides themselves.", "This incident made my depression and anxiety a lot worse, taking care of the kids and then worrying that they may have ended up in foster care or even worse, they could have just grown up with an absent mother. There was a lot to consider when doing this especially my sisters mental health which at the time did not matter to me. The younger kids seem to be happy and healthy, the youngest is a little tubby butt, and the oldest graduated early and has a job, of course they will suffer with the past abuse for the rest of their lives but I know that I prevented it from going further than just an absent mother, especially with the drug addicts she brought around. But we are all doing a lot better now and these comments helped me to stop blaming myself for my sisters sadness, realizing she could be sad simply because she got caught and had to stop having her fun and i saved these littles lives."]}
