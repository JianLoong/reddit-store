{"id": 29974, "submission_id": "17jpsgk", "title": "AITA for wearing a short sleeved dress to my stepdads birthday party?", "selftext": "My (15F) mother (33F) has a boyfriend (45M), and his birthday was last week. \n\nFor the past 5 years I have struggled with self harm, I have been clean for a year now, and the scars have faded slightly, but are still noticeable. I told my mother about 9 months ago, and she was very supportive and has helped me through all of this. I asked for my stepdad not to be informed until I was ready.\n\nMy mother and I told him about 3 months ago, and he was shocked, but didnt say anything rude which was a shocker because he's usually extremely rude to people that have scars, in public or in private. \n\nA month ago, he started planning his party, and he had a discussions with me on what dresses I would be allowed to wear. I thought this was odd as I'm the only person he did this to, but I just shuggled it off. For context, everyone that will be at that party I have known for a while, and I've been getting more confident in myself and started wearing short sleeved shirts, and all of the people that will be attending have seen me wearing short sleeves, and have seen my scars.\n\nYesterday was the party, and I wore a black short sleeved dress, and my mother wore the same as me. When we arrived, my stepdad blew up at me, calling me an attention seeker, and saying I had to put a jacket on. Neither me nor my mother had a jacket with us, as it has been pretty warm where I live despite the season. The only jacket I could wear was one that had been worn by my nan, who has cats. I am allergic to cats, and it's pretty severe, I get extreme rashes that are pretty uncomfortable. \n\nI told my stepdad I could not wear it due to the cat fur on it and he told me that I needed to go, as he wouldn't have 'an attention whore' at his party. My mother got mad at him but didn't say anything until the party was over. I went home, and got scathing messages from the family telling me I was rude for not attending my stepdads party, and that I need to get over my grudge for him.\n\nI informed them all what had actually gone down, and got my stepsister to back me up (she was there and came back with me, much to her fathers discontent). When my stepdad got home, he threw a fit, saying again I was attention seeking, and that I shouldve just worn the jacket, it was his day, I was an ass for not insisting my stepsister stay, and that I was being grounded for telling my relatives why I hadn't actually gone to the party. \n\nI refused and told him that if he wanted to punish me like a father, he'd have to act like one first. Another bit of information is that he keeps trying to get me to call him dad, and says rude things about my dad to my face, and has kicked me out more times than I can count starting from about 11. \n\nI think I mightve been the AH by not picking a long sleeved dress, but at that point it was out to everyone, I didn't think it was a big deal, and I wanted to match with my mother, who had already bought her dress. My mother is saying I shouldve just worn the jacket and put antihistamine cream on afterwards, but I'm not sure.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR- I wore a dress that showed my scars to my stepdads bday party, didn't put on a jacket, was told to leave and told my stepdad to act like a dad if he wanted to punish me like one.", "created_utc": 1698659601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jpsgk/aita_for_wearing_a_short_sleeved_dress_to_my/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
