We were supposed to get married in 2020 but for many tragic reasons it didn't happen. We still moved in together with the plan to have the wedding in 2021-2022 but unfortunately my grandmother got sick and was most likely not going to make it. I was her only grandson and first grandchild to get married and the idea of not being around long enough to see me get married broke her heart. Despite how badly Angel wanted a fairytale type of wedding she opted to have a quick and very low maintenance wedding outside of the medical facility where my grandmother was staying at so she could see from the window. My best friend/best man \"Jake\" (31m) became ordained online. My parents and Angel's parents and sister were there. My grandmother was so delighted and we all had a lot of fun sitting in law chairs just talking with my grandmother for the next hour. \n\nI want to make it very clear that this was ALL Angel's idea and I never pressured or even asked her to do this. I was more in the \"hoping my grandmother pulls through\" camp, but my wife knew better as my grandma died a few weeks after and was my rock as I grieved. Before and after I asked Angel if she was really okay with everything and she would always smile and say that she was fine and that being my wife and having a healthy and loving marriage was the ultimate prize. I never fully bought it because I know Angel her 2/10 top movies are The Wedding Planner and Monster-In Law. 3/5 if you want to count Mamma Mia.\n\nDuring that summer while I was at my In-Laws place I over heard Angel admit that while she was glad to have been able to give my grandma her wish at seeing me get married a part of her will always be bummed out that her dream wedding will never be fulfilled, but she's made peace with it. I was sad for her and decided to start secretly saving money and then once I had a certain amount, I plan to re-create my proposal to her but this time offer her the wedding she actually wanted. A wedding where everyone she wanted to attend but couldn't because of 2020 can come.\n\nThe only people who knew about what I was planning on doing was Jake and fianc\u00e9 (who's idea this totally was) and my parents. My sister \"Lucy\" (29f) found out what I was planning for Angel and then tearfully confessed that she needed surgery. I panicked at first but when she admitted that this surgery is to help her lose weight and for her mental health I refused to help pay and she called me heartless, that Angel and I were already married so it didn't matter, that having a second wedding (especially within the first five years of marriage) was tacky, and that it could wait while Lucy's mental health needed help now. \n\nI can't really talk to a lot of people in real life about this and I know there's going to be a bias with the few that I can ask so I wanted to come here and ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1673702569, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10boc3t/aita_choosing_to_spend_money_on_a_wedding_instead/", "score": 470, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can either pay for it herself or not do the surgery. She isn\u2019t entitled to anything and her comment was heartless.", "NTA your sisters weight issues are not your concern, If she want this surgery then it\u2019s up to her to pay for it, they are called elective surgeries for a reason, and there are many many weight loss programs that actually work, when the person is committed to losing weight", "NTA! \n\nIt doesn't matter if you guys \"already had a wedding\" or are \"already married\". It's YOUR money and you're not obligated to pay for your sister's anything and she's not entitled to your money. Why can't she pay for it?   \n\n\nDoes she not have insurance/will they not cover it? Maybe she can borrow from your parents? Maybe she can find some type of assistance for the surgery? Can she not lose weight without the surgery? Maybe she needs to see a therapist to help with her depression/self-esteem? Her mental health is HER responsibility and priority. It's not yours. There have to be other ways, besides borrowing YOUR savings, to help with her situation. I would suggest she look into those and stop feeling entitled to someone else's hard-earned (and saved) money.", "NTA. I was expecting your sister to need an emergency surgery like her gallbladder removed. She\u2019s putting the ownership of her physical and mental health on you, neither of which are your responsibility. Those surgeries take months to get done with all sorts of requirements. She should have already had a game plan for the surgery before she caught wind that you were trying to do something incredibly sweet for your wife. She is not entitled to the money you saved up nor are you being heartless. It seems like she demanded, instead of asked which is very telling. I would let her know you support her journey, just not financially.", "NTA - simply put it\u2019s your money and you can choose to spend it anyway you like. \n\nI don\u2019t know your sister\u2019s entire health situation but I see the way she asked as well as her reaction as quite manipulative.", "NTA. Your sister is tacky for asking.", "NTA \n\n\nWhy hasn't Lucy been saving for such an important surgery herself?", "NTA \n\nYou wife and your marriage are your life. \n\nYour sister\u2019s weight loss surgery is her life.  If it is sooo necessary, insurance will cover it. Or, if it\u2019s not medically necessary, there are many companies who will happily pay for it and charge her interest. \n\nNot your problem. She has other options besides use you as her wallet.", "NTA. I will never understand this entitlement some people have about other people\u2019s money. This is your money that you\u2019re saving for a special surprise in your life. You didn\u2019t even tell your sister nor did you offer any of this money to her. It\u2019s also interesting that it doesn\u2019t sound like she even mentioned this surgery to you until she found out you had/were saving up money.\n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t matter that you already had a wedding. The pandemic robbed a lot of us from experiencing things as we\u2019d hoped to, so I think it\u2019s lovely that you\u2019re planning this for your wife.", "NTA. Why does your sister feel entitled to the money you saved?\n\nI work in healthcare and I have recently started a weight loss regime (doctor, nutritionist, etc), and let me tell you, there are ways to lose weight without a massive surgery. \n\nThe reason she has to pay for that is because it is elective. If she needed an emergency surgery, it will be done. There are a LOT of complications for weight loss surgeries. It\u2019s part of why I went nutritionist G\u2019s surgeon.", "I'll probably get down voted too, but I don't think you're TA.  It's YOUR money, not Lucy's, and it's totally your decision where and how you spend it.  Your first priority now is your wife.  Why did Lucy only confess she needed your money for the surgery once she found out you had some saved away?", "NTA. Your sister wants to have an elective procedure and decided the money you\u2019re saving could be put to better(I.e. her) use.  If  Lucy wants the surgery so bad, she can save for it. \n\nit\u2019s a lovely thing your doing for your wife.", "NTA, if your sister wants the surgery, your sister better start saving. She felt entitled to money you\u2019ve been saving to give your wife the gift of a lifetime, invest in those that fill your cup. Your wife is your person, you sound like you know what matters, enjoy your surprise.", "NTA your sister is using you. Your wife comes first, and it\u2019s your money to do with as you please. Tell your sister to check with her insurance. They might cover the cost of the surgery, and then go spend your money how you want to", "NTA: if your sister had cancer or something terrible, then yes, definitely delay the wedding to help your sister stay alive. But if her insurance isn't covering the surgery, then it's likely elective.", "NTA - Why is your sister assuming that you would/should pay fir her surgery anyway? She\u2019s an adult and that\u2019s her responsibility. Is everyone around her not supposed to spend any money whenever she has a big expense?", "NTA. Your wife sounds amazing and you are very lucky to have her. Your sister is not entitled to your money and demanding to change your plans to pay for her \u201cnot life or death\u201d surgery instead makes her the AH. If you need someone to let you money, you ask, not demand it and insult them. Enjoy your beautiful second wedding with your wonderful wife!", "NTA- You saved for something you wanted, sounds like your sister can do the same.. and get a diet and exercise routine while she's at it. I don't know what state you live in. In some states if you don't have insurance the state will pay for gastric bypass if they are medically obese.", "NTA.  Your money, you get to spend it however you want.", "NTA. Angel had to wait for the wedding she wanted; you gave yourself time to save up for it. Lucy can also give herself some time to pay for her surgery.", "NTA\n\nAnother perspective is that your sister needs to work on her MH issues and not assume that weight loss surgery will automatically fix her issues - because it won\u2019t.\n\nSpend your savings how you and your wife see fit, enjoy the second celebration", "NTA. I can never understand why people feel entitled to other people\u2019s money, specially relatives. Go marry (again) your Angel.", "NTA. Your sister is a greedy jerk who saw that someone else had money and tried to grab it. If she wants this surgery, she can save for it or have her insurance pay.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister\u2019s surgery is an elective procedure.  If she can\u2019t afford to do it on her own, then she shouldn\u2019t be doing it.  Also, she\u2019s an AH for trying to make her problem yours.", "Your **sister** is being greedy, tacky, and entitled. She can work and save up for her own weight loss surgery. Don\u2019t let her manipulate you, OP. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA Give \"Angel\" what she deserves not your AH sister", "NTA. Your sister sounds like an entitled jerk.", "NTA. Your sister should never have put you in that position. I don't know where you live, but surgical weight loss is usually approved by insurance if it is medically necessary. If your sister has health problems related to obesity she should pursue insurance (and be prepared to fight them if denied). She should also be in therapy, not only for her mental health, but to address how she became so entitled.", "Nope. NTA. This is an elective surgery. She can diet, and she can save money. Period. \nAngel sounds like a great woman and she deserve her wedding.", "NTA \n\nWeight loss is still a choice mostly and there's other ways to get there", "NTA. I could see if maybe this were a heart transplant or removing a tumor or something life threatening, and you were the only one who could afford to help her. But to see you saving up to do something for your wife (after your wife made that big sacrifice to do something so sweet for you and your family), and then trying to take that money for her fat loss surgery??? She's the A H here, 1000%.", "NTA. Yes, your sister's physical and mental health are important but have you seen any medical proof that it is necessary? Mental health is always hard one to judge but better to sort the underlying issues that led to situation before major ops.\n\nYour wife matters. She has given a lot and a post-pandemic celebration of your marriage is pretty common these days. A lot of people were forced to cut back on numbers and now having larger receptions. So not tacky even though reason different.", "NTA It would be one thing if it was a life saving procedure. Sister can save up her own money to have her surgery.", "NTA buy your sister a WW subscription and put her on an information diet. She is being awful demanding of YOUR money.", "NTA. Your wife gave up her dream wedding once for your family. \nYou are an amazing husband coming up with a way to give her that dream and show her how much it meant to you and your family.  \nYour sister is not now or ever entitled to your money for any reason especially one so blatantly selfish.", "NTA, I might get yelled at for this, but, Lucy\u2019s surgery is elective.  If she wants to undergo it, she needs to figure it out.  If her mental health is so fragile, she probably needs to talk to someone professionally.", "NTA. I don't know what your sister's health insurance situation is, but bariatric treatments are not just a one-and-done type of thing. There are payment plans, and also levels of intervention. Yes, mental healthcare is part of it,  but that's both BEFORE and AFTER as an ongoing part of the process. In other words, you get a lot of talk therapy and inner work before you get an OR suite booked. \n\nNTA, OP. I'm sorry for your sister's health issues, but what has she done *besides looking to pick your pocket* to afford her treatment? Has she considered having it in another country? Has she set up a GoFundMe? Has she shopped doctors and treatment options? Have your parents chipped in for her? Have they taken a second mortgage out on the house? You mention exactly none of that, and it just kind of sounds like your sister is jealous of your sweet wife having a lovely, romantic wedding day and is trying to play nasty little games to  ruin it. Get ready for the secret to come out... the minute you tell Sis \"no\" she's going to pitch a fit and spoil your surprise.  So pull in your parents, have a Come To Jesus meeting with your sister, confront her about what she's doing, and lay down the BOUNDARIES while you can. And move up your timeline and let your wife enjoy the planning of her 2nd wedding as part of the gift.", "NTA. Your sister's surgery is not life saving, it's not medically necessary, it's optional. It may be *important* to *her*, but that's NOT something that is anyone else's responsibility to fund - except for her. It is *one option of several,* (the easiest and fastest) to get a desired result, her weight AND mental health have other ways of being helped besides surgery!  Your sister is giving you a song and dance routine of tears and woe, that is designed to squeeze you for money.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t invite her either. Good luck", "NTA. I thought from the title it was going to be some risky but innovative surgery that\u2019s only available for your dying sister. But she\u2019s not dying, she has mental health issues, so go to counseling, exercise, do the shit other people who don\u2019t suddenly have a piggy bank to steal do- actually do the work to lose the weight and pay for an ELECTIVE SURGERY. She\u2019s not going to die if she doesn\u2019t but is guilting you into doing the hard work for her.", "Sadly, 1 surgery is unlikely to be the solution for your sister.\n\nUse the funds as planned for your wife. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if she finds out about your sister's request and decides she wants to help. She seems like a generous soul, based on what she did for your grandma.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\nI was expecting this to be some life saving surgery but weight loss? Really???\nDon't pay for anything. Let her sort it out herself.\nEnjoy your wedding with your wife.", "NTA. \n\nSorry, this might be a little cold, but its not like your sister needs a kidney. She's allowed herself to become overweight and now wants you to bail her out instead of putting in real work herself. Prioritize your wife's \"mental health\" by giving her everything she deserves. Your sister can manage without the surgery and lose weight the old fashioned way, like most other ppl do. Its incredibly entitled of her to even ask and downright insane for her to blame you for her self-inflicted misery.", "NTA. Your relationship and the health of your marriage are just as important as your sister\u2019s mental and physical health, and furthermore, she\u2019s not entitled to a surgery that technically is elective/cosmetic - millions of people all over the world lose weight without surgery. \n\nHowever, I will say that I also believe that people don\u2019t choose to get fat, and struggling with relationships with food is incredibly difficult. It\u2019s easy to judge, but for some of us our stress will manifest in weight loss or cancer, for others it will manifest in food disorders and obesity. \n\nI think you would be within your rights to take either option here, and after your sister\u2019s reaction I definitely wouldn\u2019t reward her behaviour by giving her the money. She sounds like she takes you for granted. \n\n*However* - less about this scenario and more life in general - if we want our loved ones to put our mental health first and do things for us that aren\u2019t necessarily convenient or require some self sacrifice, we need to do the same for them. \n\nIf in ten years you\u2019d want your sister to not do something that\u2019s important to her because you wanted help with something you technically weren\u2019t entitled to help with, but which would really make your life better, would you want her to do the same?\n\nNo right or wrong - we all give and expect back different levels from people. We just need to be aware of what they are and act accordingly.", "Nta. Is a surgery necessary? Why don't go the normal way and do sports and having a healthy diet in order to lose weight? Even if she gets this surgery she will probably gain weight again since she didn't put blood sweat and tears to achieve the dream of losing weight. It's her problem so it should be her money", "NTA. Not your problem.", "NTA your sisters own doing caused her to gain weight.  Yea yea yea maybe she has something else going on but i'd have to see medical reports to beleive it.  Usually people are just lazy in taking care of themselves and she unfortunately let it get out of control.  This is for her mental health.  This is your marriage.  I think it's very sweet that you want to try to reccreate some things with it to give your wife her dream.  Do you even know if a Dr has approved this surgery?  Has she gone to a therapist or a nutritionist first to try and lose weight?  Usually real Dr's won't just go straight to surgery so she's probably at an expensive spa place that is doing it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't put it off for a second or you will end up putting it off again. Life constantly has obstructions and we just have to work around them.
