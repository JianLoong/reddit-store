At one point when we were still infants they had to draw a little dot at the bottom of one of our feet just so they could keep track of who was who for medical reasons. My mom adored the fact that Jess and I were her cute baby twin girls and treated us as precious dolls who she would frequently dress alike and always make us do things together.\n\nAt first I didn't mind it at all because, well, it was my normal and I do genuinely love my sister but when we started getting older and I developed my own interests I would get so frustrated or upset when I either couldn't do something because Jess didn't want to or the only way that I could do it was if Jess could come with me and vice versa. It sucked because despite our appearances, Jess was the more extroverted twin who liked to go to parties and do sports while I was introverted and artistic. I was always made to do what Jess wanted to do because me not wanting to be so social was seen as \"bad\" and the only way that Jess would agree to do/endure my hobbies was if I did her homework or chores.\n\nWhen my parents were divorcing I was over the moon when my dad agreed to let me live with him in another state, and Jess didn't want to move away from all her friends. My mom cried when I had to tell her I didn't want to live with her and Jess accused me of hating them. This really wrecked me emotionally and I almost caved but my dad got me into therapy who helped me gather the courage to just leave.\n\nI never really did shake off the guilt until around senior year of high school but I never once regretted my choice because of how liberating I felt by getting to just be me. I was slowly able to repair my relationship with my mom and Jess, but Jess and I were never as close as we used to be and I was honestly fine with that.\n\nFast forward to adulthood and Jess is engaged to her boyfriend \"Steve\" (36m) and their wedding is set for this Spring. Unfortunately Jess was recently in a bad accident and her face is going to need to get cosmetic surgery. She has been crying on-and-off for days over this because there's no way she'll be healed up in time for the wedding. My mom, Steve, and I have been trying to console her but it's not enough.\n\nEarlier this week my mom approached me with the idea of dressing up as Jess and pretending to be her for the ceremony and reception so the pictures will look nice. I was floored and gave a hesitant \"No\" because while I do know that this would mean a lot to my sister I just feel really uncomfortable about it. My mom was upset with me and said that it wasn't a big deal, it was just for the pictures, and asked me if I really wanted to make it so that Jess would have to be reminded of her trauma whenever she had to look at her wedding photos or just not have any photos at all? AITA?\n\nETA: Okay because I've already seen this in two other comments I just wanted to be clear about some things...\n\n1. Jess and Steve's wedding is book at their dream venue and if they postpone (which is in about three weeks) they won't be able to book it again until around 2025, and families on both sides from coming in from out-of-state.\n2. Apparently between the wedding costs and needing to save up for the cosmetic surgery Steve and Jess don't have the money to pay for professional photoshop.\n3. We live in America and as far as I know since Jess' surgery is purely for cosmetic purposes Health Insurance may not cover it, if any at all.\n4. My mom was the only one who actually approached me about this so I don't know for sure if Jess (and Steve) know about this idea, and I'm honestly a little of actually talking to them about this in case they're onboard and start to pressure me into agreeing.\n\nETA 2: Sorry for not clarifying. What my mom is proposing that I do is that I wear Jess' wedding dress and she wears whatever I was going to wear and then I just stand in her for when it's time to walk down the aisle, do the entrance at the reception, first dance, bouquet toss, and photo time. I wouldn't actually be doing the vows.

I vote:\n\nYTA.\n\nLet me first say this is an absurd request and had you said you reject solely because of the absurdity I'd agree but it seems its not the absurdity that is at the issue but that you haven't moved pass your childhood. \n\nSo since the ridiculousness of the request is not a primary issue we have you being asked to do something that you acknowledge would mean alot to your sister (which I find even more absurd that she is ok with this, but again, apparently a non-issue by you, her or mom) that you are refusing based on what issues you claim to have moved passed; issues that are decades in past, issues that you moved away from.\n\nAdding on that this ask (which is absurd) is because she went through some bad accident, I'm left to ask \"what harm befalls you?\" and it doesn't seem like any? Again, if its \"I don't want to do this absurd thing\" 100% agree and stand with you. I dunno, I guess in my book some momentarily uncomfortableness for family recovering from a bad accident is not a justifiable reason not to. \n\nHow the hell everyone is just going to look at pictures of you as a stand in for your sister and not point out how ludicruis all that is escapes me, but apparently your mom, your sister, her finance are all on board with this idea which I find absurd. \n\nBeing absurd in this way is not per se asshole to me; especially for a family. For example, the fabled Addams family entire meaning is that one groups weird is another's normal. I can't judge a family that wants to take bridal pictures with someone else as a bride (like seriously, if it doesn't matter who is actually in pictures, we can't hire a look-a-like?) as assholes merely because I find that weird.\n\nI can say that holding a decade on grudge even after you've said your over it, that refusing to help out a family member who is in need due to a medical issue is an asshole move. Again, remove the absurdity of the request and instead say she asks to do something else that would make you really uncomfortable but at the end of the day harmless and not longwithstanding, wouldn't you be an asshole to refuse? For example, saw she was in another country and needed you to stand in for legal purposes (a situation that happens occasionally and is how some military weddings occur) wouldn't you be an asshole to refuse cause she was a brat in your formative years?\n\nEdit: before I get a bunch of messages cause OP clarified that sis and future BIL aren't necessarily on board, this was written before that when the assumption (that caused OP to clarify) was they were.

Jess thought that stuff was boring because she liked to be active do things like Tennis, Rock Climb, Track, etc..", "So weird this cannot be true. What, OP would walk down the aisle \u2026. And then she and her sister would disappear, exchange dresses, veil, shoes, redo makeup and hair etc for the veil, and then her sister would say the vows? Then repeat again twice? This is just crazy.", "Wait, hold on a minute, I overlooked something-\n\n> dressing up as Jess and pretending to be her for the ceremony and reception\n\n**NOT** just dressing up for photos? *Actually* **DOING** the whole-ass wedding, *AS YOUR SISTER*? \n\nWHAT IN THE BLUE TAPDANCING FRICK? **NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**", "No. Did another edit answering this.", ">Their marriage would be null and void if you were physically in her place saying the \"I do's\".\n\nSee edit", "So she\u2019d still be participating in the ceremony and in the brides role at the wedding in your clothes, and you\u2019d be on the sidelines in her dress? Still v weird. It\u2019d also be majorly awkward to be wearing a wedding dress in the audience lmao.", "OP says mom said ceremony too. Mom wants to pics too look good and a ton pics are taken during the ceremony.", "They can always get them photoshopped later", "professional photoshop on fivvr or somewhere is cheaper than you think. it's worth looking into.", "My sister took pictures of my nibblings and then paid someone online $5 a photo to photoshop them. They don\u2019t have to have the pictures professionally done right after the wedding. They could wait until the one year mark or have one photo done a month.", "not to sound rude, but I'd imagine having a corrected face should be more important than a dream location.", "That's so creepy. And I can guarantee that your sister will feel nothing but bitterness when she looks at those photos for the rest of her life, and it's you she'll take that out on.", "So there was pressure on you to do things she wanted to all your life at the expense of your interests? This may be a bit too deep but yeah my assessment would still stand I guess.", "lol I went through the same thought process. At first I was like okay I kinda get having her take the pics instead of Jess I suppose, but the WHOLE WEDDING????", "INFO: How many photos were edited and were they good?", "You\u2019d be surprised. Getting that dream venue while you can is extremely important to a lot of brides. Not \u201cBride Wars\u201d levels of important\u2026probably.", "but like, over your face? come on now. I'm not saying you can't value your location, just seems like misplaced priorities."]}
