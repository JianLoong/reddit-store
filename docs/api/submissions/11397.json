At one point when we were still infants they had to draw a little dot at the bottom of one of our feet just so they could keep track of who was who for medical reasons. My mom adored the fact that Jess and I were her cute baby twin girls and treated us as precious dolls who she would frequently dress alike and always make us do things together.\n\nAt first I didn't mind it at all because, well, it was my normal and I do genuinely love my sister but when we started getting older and I developed my own interests I would get so frustrated or upset when I either couldn't do something because Jess didn't want to or the only way that I could do it was if Jess could come with me and vice versa. It sucked because despite our appearances, Jess was the more extroverted twin who liked to go to parties and do sports while I was introverted and artistic. I was always made to do what Jess wanted to do because me not wanting to be so social was seen as \"bad\" and the only way that Jess would agree to do/endure my hobbies was if I did her homework or chores.\n\nWhen my parents were divorcing I was over the moon when my dad agreed to let me live with him in another state, and Jess didn't want to move away from all her friends. My mom cried when I had to tell her I didn't want to live with her and Jess accused me of hating them. This really wrecked me emotionally and I almost caved but my dad got me into therapy who helped me gather the courage to just leave.\n\nI never really did shake off the guilt until around senior year of high school but I never once regretted my choice because of how liberating I felt by getting to just be me. I was slowly able to repair my relationship with my mom and Jess, but Jess and I were never as close as we used to be and I was honestly fine with that.\n\nFast forward to adulthood and Jess is engaged to her boyfriend \"Steve\" (36m) and their wedding is set for this Spring. Unfortunately Jess was recently in a bad accident and her face is going to need to get cosmetic surgery. She has been crying on-and-off for days over this because there's no way she'll be healed up in time for the wedding. My mom, Steve, and I have been trying to console her but it's not enough.\n\nEarlier this week my mom approached me with the idea of dressing up as Jess and pretending to be her for the ceremony and reception so the pictures will look nice. I was floored and gave a hesitant \"No\" because while I do know that this would mean a lot to my sister I just feel really uncomfortable about it. My mom was upset with me and said that it wasn't a big deal, it was just for the pictures, and asked me if I really wanted to make it so that Jess would have to be reminded of her trauma whenever she had to look at her wedding photos or just not have any photos at all? AITA?\n\nETA: Okay because I've already seen this in two other comments I just wanted to be clear about some things...\n\n1. Jess and Steve's wedding is book at their dream venue and if they postpone (which is in about three weeks) they won't be able to book it again until around 2025, and families on both sides from coming in from out-of-state.\n2. Apparently between the wedding costs and needing to save up for the cosmetic surgery Steve and Jess don't have the money to pay for professional photoshop.\n3. We live in America and as far as I know since Jess' surgery is purely for cosmetic purposes Health Insurance may not cover it, if any at all.\n4. My mom was the only one who actually approached me about this so I don't know for sure if Jess (and Steve) know about this idea, and I'm honestly a little of actually talking to them about this in case they're onboard and start to pressure me into agreeing.\n\nETA 2: Sorry for not clarifying. What my mom is proposing that I do is that I wear Jess' wedding dress and she wears whatever I was going to wear and then I just stand in her for when it's time to walk down the aisle, do the entrance at the reception, first dance, bouquet toss, and photo time. I wouldn't actually be doing the vows.

I vote:\n\nYTA.\n\nLet me first say this is an absurd request and had you said you reject solely because of the absurdity I'd agree but it seems its not the absurdity that is at the issue but that you haven't moved pass your childhood. \n\nSo since the ridiculousness of the request is not a primary issue we have you being asked to do something that you acknowledge would mean alot to your sister (which I find even more absurd that she is ok with this, but again, apparently a non-issue by you, her or mom) that you are refusing based on what issues you claim to have moved passed; issues that are decades in past, issues that you moved away from.\n\nAdding on that this ask (which is absurd) is because she went through some bad accident, I'm left to ask \"what harm befalls you?\" and it doesn't seem like any? Again, if its \"I don't want to do this absurd thing\" 100% agree and stand with you. I dunno, I guess in my book some momentarily uncomfortableness for family recovering from a bad accident is not a justifiable reason not to. \n\nHow the hell everyone is just going to look at pictures of you as a stand in for your sister and not point out how ludicruis all that is escapes me, but apparently your mom, your sister, her finance are all on board with this idea which I find absurd. \n\nBeing absurd in this way is not per se asshole to me; especially for a family. For example, the fabled Addams family entire meaning is that one groups weird is another's normal. I can't judge a family that wants to take bridal pictures with someone else as a bride (like seriously, if it doesn't matter who is actually in pictures, we can't hire a look-a-like?) as assholes merely because I find that weird.\n\nI can say that holding a decade on grudge even after you've said your over it, that refusing to help out a family member who is in need due to a medical issue is an asshole move. Again, remove the absurdity of the request and instead say she asks to do something else that would make you really uncomfortable but at the end of the day harmless and not longwithstanding, wouldn't you be an asshole to refuse? For example, saw she was in another country and needed you to stand in for legal purposes (a situation that happens occasionally and is how some military weddings occur) wouldn't you be an asshole to refuse cause she was a brat in your formative years?\n\nEdit: before I get a bunch of messages cause OP clarified that sis and future BIL aren't necessarily on board, this was written before that when the assumption (that caused OP to clarify) was they were.

Jess thought that stuff was boring because she liked to be active do things like Tennis, Rock Climb, Track, etc..", "So weird this cannot be true. What, OP would walk down the aisle \u2026. And then she and her sister would disappear, exchange dresses, veil, shoes, redo makeup and hair etc for the veil, and then her sister would say the vows? Then repeat again twice? This is just crazy.", "Wait, hold on a minute, I overlooked something-\n\n> dressing up as Jess and pretending to be her for the ceremony and reception\n\n**NOT** just dressing up for photos? *Actually* **DOING** the whole-ass wedding, *AS YOUR SISTER*? \n\nWHAT IN THE BLUE TAPDANCING FRICK? **NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**", "No. Did another edit answering this.", ">Their marriage would be null and void if you were physically in her place saying the \"I do's\".\n\nSee edit", "So she\u2019d still be participating in the ceremony and in the brides role at the wedding in your clothes, and you\u2019d be on the sidelines in her dress?

They could wait until the one year mark or have one photo done a month.", "not to sound rude, but I'd imagine having a corrected face should be more important than a dream location.", "That's so creepy. And I can guarantee that your sister will feel nothing but bitterness when she looks at those photos for the rest of her life, and it's you she'll take that out on.", "So there was pressure on you to do things she wanted to all your life at the expense of your interests? This may be a bit too deep but yeah my assessment would still stand I guess.", "lol I went through the same thought process. At first I was like okay I kinda get having her take the pics instead of Jess I suppose, but the WHOLE WEDDING????", "INFO: How many photos were edited and were they good?", "You\u2019d be surprised. Getting that dream venue while you can is extremely important to a lot of brides. Not \u201cBride Wars\u201d levels of important\u2026probably.", "but like, over your face? come on now. I'm not saying you can't value your location, just seems like misplaced priorities.", "NTA, don\u2019t do it. This seems like a situation that will only bring more trouble. She should just get digital copies of her wedding photos. She can have the photoshop done at a later date when finances allow since postponing is not an option.", "NTA. \n\nOf course don't do this because it is weird and uncomfortable, but if you feel bad about it, here are some other things to consider:\n\n1. You don't even know if Jess would want this, because only your mom asked you. \n2. Logistically this isn't going to work, as the guests will see you two like...switch off?\n3. If Jess DID want you to do this, she would still end up being mad at you because she will know that you are the person in her wedding photos, you are \"prettier\" than her, etc. She will resent you whether you do this or not. \n\nSo no, don't do it. Tell Jess your mom asked you to do this, and then steer clear of the mayhem.", "NTA - but this suggestion is creepy AF.  Please don't do this.  Please don't even think about doing this.  Tell your mom a firm no and never bring it up again.", "NTA So you marry the guy and the whole day will be about you? She will even participate in her perfect wedding? Yes, this will be soooo much better as not looking perfect in the pictures /s \n\nIf she remembers back to her wedding, she will also remember... nothing, since it wasn't her who married her husband. Should you also switch roles in the wedding night?\n\nThis whole idea is so crazy. This is not a photoshot for some commercials. This are pictures for them to remember their important day and they have no meaning if it isn\u2019t them on it. \n\nAnd you don't know if she will look 100% the same after the surgery. They can photoshop the photos later. They will get money as presents. She can wear nice face jewellery depending on her injury...\n\nOr they make some photos later with them both wearing the wedding outfits. So many possibilities.", "What the holy hell. This is really weird. NTA.", "NTA. Some movie exec is already figuring out how to get this madness greenlit. It'll be on Hallmark before that venue opens up. \n\nFwiw, their photo package should include digital copies. If they can't afford the retouches now, they could always get a quote for having them photoshopped down the line.

What is your mother thinking?", "Your mom sounds like a psycho. This is all wrong. Just very, very wrong. NTA. Stay away from your mom. She's sick.", "NTA\n\nThis cannot be real", "NTA this sounds like a bad tv movie.  Your mother sees you as an extension of Jess and not your own pwrson", "NTA, kinda weird. Sorry but what is next, hey will you carry your sister's baby so she doesnt have to be reminded of the pain of childbirth.", "NTA. Here's a n option: Find a reputable make-up artist and give a bridal session as a gift to your sister. Pay for the trial too.", "NTA. The whole idea is preposterous and creepy. Stand your ground!", "NTA this is absurd.\n\nShe should just look for a good makeup artist.", "NTA\n\nThis is ABSURD. It would be one thing for you to take a couple pictures in the dress. Still very weird and I would not be down, but maybe it would make the photoshop easier or cheaper. \n\nIt\u2019s another thing to literally do the entire day in her place! I can\u2019t imagine how awful I would feel watching my sister kiss my husband on the wedding day. And then none of the memories actually are your sisters. \n\nThis is a very weird idea and it seems like it\u2019s all due to your mother\u2019s vanity.", "NTA. I think that perhaps the reason this is an acceptable solution to your mom is because she *still* does not see you and your sister as two individuals. She sees you as a singular unit of personhood rather than the two separate people that you are. You are your own person. You are neither merged with nor interchangeable with your sister. Your mom\u2019s perspective is not healthy, and you don\u2019t need to be a part of it.", "LOL this is a hilarious little piece of pure fiction.  SO many plot holes.", "NTA, that's so fucking weird", "NTA\n\nThat just seems weird to me. I get that she'll feel insecure, but if years down the line the marriage doesn't work out and you are the one in the wedding photos? I would not want that.", "NTA\n>Apparently between the wedding costs and needing to save up for the cosmetic surgery Steve and Jess don't have the money to pay for professional photoshop.\n\nPhotoshop does not have a timeline, just because they can\u2019t afford it now doesn\u2019t mean they cannot in a year or 5 years from now. Besides, photos are meant to be reflected upon to reignite the memories of the moment. In this case there wouldn\u2019t be much of a moment bc you\u2019d essentially be the bride for 1/2 of the wedding and your sister would miss out on that experience", "This is like a plot from Sweet Valley High or something! How absolutely insane. If pictures are the only concern, someone needs to tell her about photoshop. Emphatically NTA.", "NTA, and your mom's request is bonkers. Feel free to ignore it for the crazy request that it is.", "....what?\n\nI mean, besides the audacity of treating two people like they're completely interchangeable, wouldn't Jess want to experience those moments of her wedding herself? So you're going to walk down the aisle in her wedding dress, then swap places with her at the alter so she can (presumably wearing your non-wedding dress) take her vows, and then swap back for the photos? How offensive and bizarre for everyone involved. \n\nNtA", "NTA you aren't her stunt double. You are your own person. \n\nNot to mention, what bride cares more about photos than actually participating in her own wedding? Those memories are irreplaceable. \n\nYou know what can be replicated though? Bridal photos. She can put on her dress and get photos taken literally whenever. \n\nIt sounds like your mom still thinks y'all are dolls.", "NTA. Even if you\u2019re not actually doing the vows, it still feels weird and borderline creepy to me. I don\u2019t understand why someone would want to go to such lengths to pretend that something that never happened was their reality.", "NTA. I would tell your mom this is the kind of thinking that made you want to go live with your dad all those year ago. One daughter cannot simply replace the other one. What the actual hell lady!", "NTA, as a fellow twin (but not identical), no you are not the AH at all and the idea of having someone pose as me for pictures is weird tbh. Can't the photograpger use angles to hide the scars? Is it possible to have a hairstyle to hide the worse scars? there's ways to get round it where she's the center of attention at her own wedding and gets to be in pictures, especailly if they scar and people see them they'll want to know why you're posing as the bride while your sister poses as you in her own wedding", "NTA!! This is so much to put on somebody\u2026 Your sister will forever know that she isn\u2019t the one in those photographs and that she didn\u2019t get to walk down the aisle\u2026 Your mom is cruel\u2014 did she even speak with your sister before proposing this idea?", "NTA and that is SO fucked up.", "NTA They want you to pretend to be her so that she\u2019s not reminded of the trauma, but if you pose as her then every time she looks at those photos she\u2019ll still be faced with that trauma. If this means so much to her than unfortunately they\u2019re going to have to start thinking about rescheduling.", "NTA, even without the full historical background.\n\nAlso, how does your mom imagine this? Reading the story, your moms reasoning is that your sister would look at the photos one day, and then remember the accident from which she (by that time) has fully recovered. So better you substitute her, so your sister can look at the pictures knowing it's not her being \"in love\" with her husband, but her sister? How's that any better?", "No is the only response to this wacky suggestion. NTA", "It would be costly,but I honestly think postponing this would be the best thing. It\u2019s an event that\u2019s supposed to live in pictures and memory forever,and if sis is (understandably) not the way she wants to be,it\u2019s the best thing to do. Besides,I don\u2019t think she would be as happy with the \u2018stand in\u2019 pics as she thinks she would be. She would know she was looking at you and not her and not having a memory to go with the pic takes away a lot of the whole point of it.", "Wtf did I just read. Honey it\u2019s a darn good thing you got away from your mother. This is so effed up on so many levels. NTA obviously. It\u2019s just gross. When she\u2019s all healed up she can put her dress back on and get gussied up and her hubby can go take photos. May not be how they planned it but that\u2019s life. Having you \u201cstand in\u201d just ewwww.", "NTA this is literally insane but anhow I also don't think it's real.", "NTA, and has no one heard if photoshop???? Even better because the photographer will literally have a duplicate template to make adjustments from. Tell your mom to use her brain. People are gonna wonder why there was no kiss or anything.", "Is this even real?

It looks like Jess is her golden child. Come what may, don\u2019t agree to this.", "NTA- Respectfully, this sounds like a plot for a psychological thriller.", "NTA- 1. Photoshopping pics is not that expensive.  2. If she was hurt in an accident, this is not a health insurance issue. The car insurance or homeowners/business insurance should be paying for this.", "NTA. Definitely don\u2019t do that, mostly for yourself, because this is a terrible request to make of you, but also for Jess. She is emotionally messed up from the accident right now and would seriously regret it down the road if she wasn\u2019t actually in any of her wedding photos. She\u2019ll be glad you refused once she calms down. \n\nAlso, your mom sounds like a piece of work. Good on you for maintaining boundaries.", "NTA. This is such a weird ask on your moms part. Your sister will look at her wedding photos and see\u2026..you. And if the cosmetic surgery makes her look any different than she does now it\u2019ll be a painful reminder of her before\u2026I cannot imagine how painful that would be for her. \n\nI get not wanting to postpone but they should. Your sister is going to be so focused on her looks the entire time she is not going to enjoy her wedding. And what a waste that will be. If they still want to get married they should do it at the courthouse and then do the big wedding and reception in 2025.\n\nIf that is seriously not an option what if people chipped in for the photographer to professionally photoshop the photos as the gift instead? But only if that is something your sister would truly want.", "NTA  Sister can wear a veil for most of the ceremony and get the face pix photoshopped later.", "NTA\n\nFirst you must talk to both of them. I cannot imagine wanting to see, for the rest of my life, fake photos of my wedding. I would never agree. \n\nEveryone else (not knowing you 2 now) might think it's her. But she will know it's you and she might hate you for \"stealing\" her wedding.\n\nCan you imagine having those portraits around your house - your husband with your sister? \n\nAnd what about your BIL? Is he the kind of guy to watch these pictures and not be resentful that his wife isn't there? \n\nBut i don't know why, i think your mother is lying.\n\nTalk to them. No matter what. \n\nAnd if they really say they want this, tell them why you feel it's not a good idea.\n\nEdit typo", "So instead of pictures that remind your sister of her terrible accident, your mom and sister would rather have pictures that remind her of how her sister got to share a precious moment with her husband that she couldn't be in place of because of an accident?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Stay firm and keep saying no. And your sister might get insurance paid for because it\u2019s a mental health issue. I have seen it paid for before under that condition. Just like if you have breast cancer, most insurances cover reconstruction of the breast or breasts for mental health reasons.  It would be worth her looking in to it. But don\u2019t stand in. You don\u2019t want to so just keep refusing.", "NTA. Sounds like an episode of Growing Pains, or Full House or something stupid like that.", "NTA\n\nThat is totally effed up on your Mother's part - she needs therapy or a good smack upside the head.\n\nSecondly, if Jess thinks this is a good idea, she needs therapy as well.\n\nI would tell your Mom this:\n\n\"Mom I have been thinking about your request that I pretend to be Jess for her wedding pictures, etc and I have to say that the more I think about it the completely effed up and wrong it sounds.  WTF Mom?!?   Jess and I are not interchangeable doll parts.  We are individual  people and this is Jess's day celebrating her marriage.  If Jess having a unmarred face is more important to you than Jess being celebrated in all aspects of her marriage, you are a horrible mother.\n\nThink about what you are telling Jess.  You are saying that you think so little of Jess as a person that you would rather swap her for a less broken part rather then celebrate her survival and her joy in being wed to the person she loves.  That is wrong on so many levels and a horrible, horrible way to think about and treat both your daughters.\"\n\nDon't mention this to Jess, if Jess doesn't know she doesn't need to know her mother thinks so little of her at this point.\n\nIf Jess brings this up to you , I would reply:\n\n\"WTF Jess, that's insane!  This is your day to celebrate your love with Steve.  If having an unmarred face is more important to you that you going through all the rituals with Steve, you need serious therapy and you are not ready to get married at all. I am not a backup copy of you and I am not your substitute.  Go get yourself a good makeup or just celebrate the fact you are alive.\"", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m guessing this is all coming from your mother and not Jess.  The request is so bizarre it sounds like it\u2019s coming from someone who cannot or does not want to differentiate individuality.\n\nUnless if Jess and Steve are very superficial people in general, or they both see you as an extension of Jess\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine either of them being okay with the idea of you stepping her place just for the sake of pictures. \n\nI don\u2019t know her photographer but mine followed me everywhere.  From the moment we got ready, got into the car, the kissing in the ceremony, the whole reception party, speeches, etc.  I can\u2019t imagine anyone ever feeling okay with someone else parading as them.  For Jess it\u2019ll be like her being an outsider watching an imposter posing as her.  And for Steve hell pretend to marry a stranger who he doesn\u2019t love just for the sake of pictures.  \n\nEven if Jess did ask you I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll look at her wedding photos with fond memories.  It\u2019ll open a whole new can of worms of insecurity and jealousy.  She really does not need that kind of mental stress.\n\nI would keep telling your mom a firm no.  If Jess and Steve does not approach you closer to the wedding date then you know it\u2019s all your mom\u2019s idea.  And for Jess\u2019s mental health sake it\u2019s best not to mention anything about it.\n\nWait until Jess and Steve decides what to do.  If they want to postpone the wedding then that\u2019s the verdict.  If they want to go forward with it you can always offer them one of those wedding photo ops once Jess is in a better state.  In some countries (especially Asian countries) it\u2019s normal to do pre/post wedding photos.  It\u2019s like a whole day thing of taking extremely beautiful (and very photoshop) photos for a pretty affordable price.", "NTA, and what a mess your Mom created. Standing in for your sister at those moments takes away from your sister. A dream wedding and you pass on walking down the aisle? Instead of asking you for this crazy thing, maybe your Mom should give them  the professional photographer that can meet your sister's needs. That is if she really even wants that.", "NTA, no way would that be okay. She would look at the pictures and know they aren't her. Have them photoshop the pictures.", "NTA this would be my hill, don\u2019t do it. They will never stop asking you to do stuff like this if you don\u2019t shut it down.

Nope do not do this, it would ruin the wedding for her. And probably illegal? But if you can swing it maybe gift them photoshop? So she can enjoy all her moments. Or go in with another family member?", "NTA. I'd talk to your sister and FBIL. I doubt they'd be on board. Your mother is unhinged and from the background you gave, it's sounds like she's been that way a while. She's treating you like dolls again. I would suggest you approach the conversation in a way that it is apparent that you don't like the idea. I.e. \"Mom just came to me with the most bizarre request, did you know about this?\" Etc. If she didn't know the negative connotation may keep her from latching on to the idea or getting too excited about it. However you chose to go about it, it's a conversation that needs to take place. Mom might end up going even further off the rails if you don't stop it now.", "NTA tell your mom to set up a fund for the photoshop work.", "maybe you can gift her the photoshop option", "Absolutely NTA omg. I can bet Jess doesn\u2019t want this and doesn\u2019t even know.

This is just 50 shades of WRONG.  Mom needs to keep her nose out - it's not her wedding.  This sounds like the kind of mother who would show up at her own daughter's wedding wearing a wedding dress or a white lace cocktail dress.\n\nSolution?  Go through with the wedding as planned.  Get the unedited \\[digital\\] photos from the photographer.  Then, Jess & hubby can save the $$$ to have them photoshopped at a later date.", "NTA.\n\nNo.  End of story.  Don't explain, argue, or justify.  No.  That's it.", "NTA . That is so weird, inappropriate,  Icky and just wrong. Jess does realize if you stand in for Jess you have to kiss her new husband while pretending to be her. The whole notion is messed up. Jess will always look at those pictures and know it is not her.

I can't imagine any woman would be OK with standing on the sideline while someone else \"married\" their husband.\n\nIf this is true, OP should be focused on getting her sister to understand that no scar is worth giving up that precious moment. This isn't about OP. It is about a distraught traumatized woman struggling to come to terms with her disfigurement. OP is kind YTA for making this about them and not seeing how tragic it is that her sister is even considering this.

The easy solution is they just pay for the raw images and the same photographer or another can do the touchups at a later date when they've saved up.", "If the photographer takes a bunch of face shots of OP any photoshopping could do a face swap after the fact. OP\u2019s face could provide the base to make it easier.", "This!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\n\nAnd please be NC with your mom!

Just because someone did the work through therapy to work over a trauma doesn\u2019t mean they forgot nor that there aren\u2019t any trigger lingering that could put her back in that unhealthy mindset. Healing is a continuous journey it\u2019s not a scratch that just vanishes. And even if it wasn\u2019t for that she would never be an ah to say no to this completely crazy idea what are you on ?\n\nAnd why tf would you say let\u2019s remove the absurdity when it\u2019s what makes the context of the situation ?", "This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Even if you do stand in for photos, she's going to remember it wasn't her in the photos and the photos will mean nothing emotionally", "Is your mom on the vain side? Is it possible *she* wants the photos to look perfect and not be \u201cmarred\u201d by your sister\u2019s \u201cimperfect\u201d face? Because sometimes moms make weddings about themselves.", "Um, if they can afford a huge wedding and they can afford the surgery, they can afford to pay someone to photoshop. Hell, if they posted a request on reddit they'd likely get a few dozen people willing to work on some of the photos for free out of the goodness of their own hearts.\n\nThere's no way that anyone sane would want their wedding pictures to be pictures of their twin instead of them. That's so fucking weird. \n\nThis post is bordering on fake as fuck.", "Do you plan to get them a wedding gift? Maybe you can find a photo shop specialist on somewhere like fivver like someone mentioned below and offer to pay for that as the gift \ud83e\udd70", "Fiverr would be the first place to check if the photographer isn't going to do it for them(which most would)", "The photographer may offer it.

It's no biggie that you figured out where she got the names from.", "If I was paying to have my dream wedding at my dream venue, I would want to be the one walking down the aisle, not watch someone else stand in as bride for *my* wedding. If your sister goes along with this, she will still feel robbed. It would be better to wait two years rather than never get to actually have those moments.", "I think OP has edited that it would be everything except the vows. Like walking down the aisle, first dance, etc. Super weird still.", "Riiigghhhhttt???!!!", "These are all things a woman only gets to do once with her husband, I can't believe she would want to give them up for the sake of looking good in the photos. I could see maybe posing for a few photos so she'd have some nice close ups to maybe display in her home afterwards but not all of that. \nShe could wear a veil for the walk down the aisle", "You should point out to your mom that this would make the wedding extremely awkward for all of the guests.

Plenty of people move to the US at a young age, or grow up between multiple countries. That's not  odd. OP could have moved to the US at the age of 6 from Germany and it wouldn't be relevant to include or weird. \"We live in America\" could just simply mean that they in fact currently live in America, and that's their insurance reality. This all fits how friends who have an American parent and one from the EU have described their lives/ways they talk. \n\nEnglish is the closest thing I have to native language (in that I learned it first, but it's not our mothertongue if that makes sense) and I still constantly make weird mistakes. It happens.", ">Photoshop is included in any wedding photographer package\n\nThis isn't universal.  It wasn't included in my package *10 years ago (in the US).  I think it was an optional extra.\n\n*my husband would be shocked to hear I said we were married an extra decade.  It has only been 10 years.  Oops.", "My husband who is just a random office worker edited my sister's wedding photos because in all the excitement we forgot to get photos of the while family.  He's an absolute amateur and managed to crop people from other photos into one photo. It is absolutely impossible to tell - and it's the one everyone printed. It cost whatever was the monthly license of Photoshop + his time.", "If it gets your sister and mom off your back and are comfortable letting me know the extent of the injuries, I may be able to edit a handful and I won\u2019t charge you.

Let me know.", "My ex and I eloped. On our one year anniversary, we had Glamour Shots taken in our wedding clothes. They turned out AMAZING and to this day are probably the best photos ever taken of me. I definitely recommend this method to anyone who needs to throw a wedding on a budget.", "Apparently not but I have only been married once. It was part of the package deal with the place we got married. \n\nBy buying the package we had to use their photographer, their caterer, and their DJ and their servers. The only real add ons were around alcohol and there was rules in the contract around that like if we opted to serve hard liquor we had to hire their security.", "Yeah, agreed, this isn't a thing. We got the RAW files from our wedding photographer because my spouse and I are both competent Photoshop users and wanted the option to make different stylistic choices on our photos down the line, but we knew it was a weird ask, and we offered him a substantial additional payment for them. I think the only reason he agreed was because he's primarily a videographer and film editor, and wedding photography is something he only lightly dabbles in. A friend who's a full-time wedding photographer was shocked when we told her we were getting the RAWs, and implied we were rude for even asking.\n\nHonestly, I've never known anyone else who was able to get the RAW files from their wedding.", "It was part of our package. You might not but we got the digital negatives along with signing over the rights to the photos to us.", "There's no way on EARTH I believe the bride would be on board with this \"have my sister pretend to me be during my wedding and  in my wedding pictures.\"\n\nI read that right, didn't I?
