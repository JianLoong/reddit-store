However, she questions everything i say and likes to \u201csplit hairs\u201d as ive heard people call it (im not sure the proper term). \n\nBut essentially if i was to tell her that shes standing in 3 feet of snow, when shes buried to her waste, she\u2019d pull out a tape measure, measure it and tell me im wrong bc its 3 feet and 1 inch.\n\nIve expressed to her multiple times that i really don\u2019t  like that every word i say has to be fact checked by google or some other source. But she continues. \n\nThe last straw was a few days ago when she went to the hospital with her friend (she needed to go for something and her friend needed her blood drawn) \n\nIm in the medical field and have just recently started working with lab techs and learning a lot about blood and blood draws. \n\nI like to spread knowledge to people, i like explaining things ive learned bc it not only helps me remember ling term, but also gives people some insight so She told me about her friend getting blood drawn i took the opportunity to talk about some of the stuff i just learned.\n\nShe always asked about my day and how work was but idrk how to talk about it, its like when people say \u201ctell me about yourself\u201d and then you just forget who you are.\n\nI explained to her how, sometimes when they draw blood theyre not after the blood, but instead the serum in the blood and the blood itself gets disposed of.\n\nShe proceeded to tell me that i was wrong bc they drew blood so thats what they where after and the googled it and then explained labs to me.\n\n(For context im military)\nAlong with my job also comes a lot of things i cant tell her. Her friend is also military but in the NG and a different mos so its not quite the same.  \nShe asked me a question and i told her i cant talk about it, and she asked a few more times to the same answer.\nShe proceeded to google if i could tell her and ask her friend and came to the conclusion that i could disclose the information.\n\n(This isnt the first time this has happened)\nAt this point im pissed for the lack of a better word, and i pretty much say since her friend and google know more about my job and life then i do then she can just google everything.\n\nAfter a few hours she made a fee statements and i responded with \u201chas that been fact checked\u201d \nAfter a few minutes of this she stated how it was annoying and pissing her off, which i responded \u201care you sure you\u2019re mad? Was that consulted with google first\u201d \n\nYes im aware its petty but i tried being mature and talking to her, didnt work, so after over a year I finally gave up.\n\nAITA\n\n[EDIT] I dont want bad things said ab her.

She\u2019s disrespectful and has make no attempt to adjust her behaviour despite clear communication\n\nYou\u2019ve gotten to the stage where you don\u2019t actually like her all that much anymore.  It happens.\n\nNTA", "This has been going on for over a year.  It isn't going to change.  \n\nIf you thought it was an adorable quirk, that would be one thing.  But you don't.   You find it annoying and exasperating (perhaps due to the fact that it *is* annoying and exasperating).  \n\nI especially love the part that you're supposed to share sensitive/classified information she's not cleared for because Google said so.  Also because she's always right.  Google and her BFF all think so.  Just ask her.\n\nOnly try to imagine trying to raise a child with her.  \n\nThis isn't the woman for you.  I'm sorry.  She's not.  Thank God you don't believe in short engagements.  Break it off and move on.  There are many, many nice women out there who won't relentlessly annoy you.  Go find one.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Is it possible that your way of spreading knowledge feels condenscending/belittling to her and she responds to that by nitpicking what you say?", "I absolutely hate this. I worked at the same place as my bf and I was the problem solved at the company. Solving all his issues too. He still works there and I left a while ago, but when I ask about his day, he will man splain all the details of work in the story , while I keep telling him, yes I know how the procedure part works, I worked there, get to the funny part of the actual story!!", "NTA. Frankly your fiance' sounds exhausting and aggravating. \n\nDo you want to spend your life with someone like this? Please think about this carefully.", "So many thoughts here. First, probably NTA. I enjoy a bit of friction so I am not going to judge you too harshly on the last two paragraphs. Sometimes people have to have their own behaviour turned back on them to appreciate how irritating it is.\n\nMy first question, as others have also asked, is why you want to marry this person? It sounds incredibly stressful and not the least but fun at all. As time goes on, it won\u2019t get better. As someone in the military, you may appreciate the concept that you will be fighting a rearguard action throughout the course of your relationship and possibly beyond.\n\nIs it possible your fianc\u00e9e is neurodivergent in some way? I had a university classmate, back in the early 90s, who was undiagnosed at the time, who demanded precision in even casual communications. She would have hated that I deliberately wrote \u201cearly 90s\u201d above. She would have asked which 90s \u2014 the 1790s? 1190s 90s AD? 90s BC . . . ? You would have expected that she knew we were in our early 20s, not 220 years old (and so on). It was exhausting being around her and, to be honest, we coped by being petty and occasionally cruel. Many years later she revealed on social media that she was on the autism spectrum. It put everything in a different light. She demanded precise language because that is how she made sense of the world. I wonder if you fianc\u00e9e might be dealing with something similar.\n\nOr maybe she just enjoys being pedantic. Using your 3 feet of snow example, and because I live in Canada and am very familiar with snow, I have questions. Is it 3\u2019 including or excluding the layer of ice and snow already on the ground? Is the ground reasonably level? If not, is the measurement being taken from the highest or lowest point? Is it entirely fresh snow or fresh snow in top of previous snow? What about drifting. Has the snowplough been by or has someone shovelled, thus impacting the depth of snow?\n\nHonestly, this all sounds exhausting. I don\u2019t see how this can be in anyway enjoyable.", "The house isnt big enough for 2 know it alls", "For some reason my wife started doing that to me 5-10 years after we got married. Or, I started noticing it after 5-10 years.  \nI completely stopped answering her questions that would result in an opinion or anything that could be questioned.   \nI guess it started long before that now that I think about it...  \nShe once picked an argument about stereo equipment with me for some reason. This would have been around 2000. Funny thing is, I was a salesman at a stereo shop for the two previous years and was pretty knowledgeable.   \n\n\nI can tell you this, it will not change, it will not improve. If it really bothers you, cut your losses now. It may seem harsh, but always being 2nd guessed or having your partner tell you that they confirmed what you stated with another person gets really old, really quickly. It can feel like your partner doesn't value your input. At least, that is how I feel when it happens to me.", "ESH.

What full grown adult thinks that orange juice can literally get rid of a cold? I had a boyfriend who told me that soda cans become heavier when crushed. I told him, no they just become more dense.  I explained that nothing is being added to the can, it is just changing shape. This is pre Smart phone era so I finally just said, ok we will check when we get to work (we had letter scales at our place of employment). Obviously I proved him wrong but honestly, after that I could never get it out of my head that he wasn't too smart.

When your girlfriend is telling you that her friend just got blood drawn, you don\u2019t need to tell her that sometimes doctors actually want the serum. It\u2019s completely irrelevant. She doesn\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t make a difference to what happened or what she\u2019s telling you about. She doesn\u2019t need to be constantly fact checking everything you say and trying to prove you wrong unless you have a history of making stuff up and lying to her.

Most things in life don't require it. So I don't.\n\nIt sounds like she has something going on. Either a need to be \"right\" - a power thing;  a mental health issues;  a feeling that she needs to think more critically?\n\nFind out WHY she's doing this.

However, she questions everything i say and likes to \u201csplit hairs\u201d as ive heard people call it (im not sure the proper term). \n\nBut essentially if i was to tell her that shes standing in 3 feet of snow, when shes buried to her waste, she\u2019d pull out a tape measure, measure it and tell me im wrong bc its 3 feet and 1 inch.\n\nIve expressed to her multiple times that i really don\u2019t  like that every word i say has to be fact checked by google or some other source. But she continues. \n\nThe last straw was a few days ago when she went to the hospital with her friend (she needed to go for something and her friend needed her blood drawn) \n\nIm in the medical field and have just recently started working with lab techs and learning a lot about blood and blood draws. \n\nI like to spread knowledge to people, i like explaining things ive learned bc it not only helps me remember ling term, but also gives people some insight so She told me about her friend getting blood drawn i took the opportunity to talk about some of the stuff i just learned.\n\nShe always asked about my day and how work was but idrk how to talk about it, its like when people say \u201ctell me about yourself\u201d and then you just forget who you are.\n\nI explained to her how, sometimes when they draw blood theyre not after the blood, but instead the serum in the blood and the blood itself gets disposed of.\n\nShe proceeded to tell me that i was wrong bc they drew blood so thats what they where after and the googled it and then explained labs to me.\n\n(For context im military)\nAlong with my job also comes a lot of things i cant tell her. Her friend is also military but in the NG and a different mos so its not quite the same.  \nShe asked me a question and i told her i cant talk about it, and she asked a few more times to the same answer.\nShe proceeded to google if i could tell her and ask her friend and came to the conclusion that i could disclose the information.\n\n(This isnt the first time this has happened)\nAt this point im pissed for the lack of a better word, and i pretty much say since her friend and google know more about my job and life then i do then she can just google everything.\n\nAfter a few hours she made a fee statements and i responded with \u201chas that been fact checked\u201d \nAfter a few minutes of this she stated how it was annoying and pissing her off, which i responded \u201care you sure you\u2019re mad? Was that consulted with google first\u201d \n\nYes im aware its petty but i tried being mature and talking to her, didnt work, so after over a year I finally gave up.\n\nAITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Husband tells me about it (which was annoying it and of itself.  Like I wouldn't be aware of a ballot measure that would GREATLY affect my profession..) and when I told him what he was saying couldn't happen he began to *explain how the bail system in our state works*.

It's not a conversation and it's not a journey of knowledge.

Not every conversation needs to end with facts.

If OP isn't always throwing out random trivia, then N.T.A.", "Sometimes when you zoom in on specific facts, you miss the point of what the person was trying to communicate, which can be frustrating for that person. There are actually two good examples of this happening that OP has provided, which indicates both he and his partner are doing this to each other.\n\nIn his post, OP shared an example that if he told his partner that the snow is waist high, and said that she would feel it necessary to measure down to the inch. In that example, the exact measurement of snow depth was an unnecessary level of specificity. Taking the measurement with the goal of correcting him would shift her focus away from the conversation and whatever he was trying to communicate *about* the snow, or how it might affect them. For example, if he had wanted to talk about shovel the snow, or the need to launder their wet clothes when they went inside, or to change their plans for the day because of the snow, then none of that would be affected by knowing the exact depth of the snow down to the inch. \u201cWaist high\u201d would be sufficient for that purpose. But if he had phrased it like a question and wondered exactly how high the snow was, measuring it down to the inch would be helpful and welcome.\n\nIn the comments, OP shared an example where his fianc\u00e9 mentioned that she wasn\u2019t feeling well, and had drunk some orange juice. OP told her that orange juice does nothing to help colds, and that she was incorrect for drinking some believing it would help. In this example, OP is the one who fixated on a detail of fact and missed what his fianc\u00e9 was trying to communicate. She was saying she didn\u2019t feel well, so she was likely looking for a bit of comfort from her partner, or perhaps to modify any plans they might have. OP was too focused on being factually correct about one detail to hear the larger message. Additionally, his \u201ccorrection\u201d was itself factually incorrect. While it is true that the vitamin C content or orange juice is overestimated by most people (as are the effects of large doses of vitamin C in general), it is not true that orange juice has no positive effects at all. At the very least, hydration of any kind is helpful when you\u2019re sick. Additionally, the placebo effect is real even when people know they\u2019re taking the placebo, so drinking a beverage associated with comfort and healing is helpful even if the specific ingredients don\u2019t have a measurable medicinal effect. At the very least, drinking orange juice is harmless and makes her feel better emotionally, which *is* a positive effect. Moreover, OP has said in the comments that he didn\u2019t want her to continue doing something \u201cineffective\u201d, but he did not offer any additional help or comfort. He wasn\u2019t focused on helping his partner, he was focused on correcting her.\n\nAfter reading OP\u2019s comments, I think it\u2019s clear that both of them are communicating poorly. They both seem to be more focused on being factually correct than on trying to understand what their partner is saying to them. When that happens, it can make the other person feel like they are not being listened to or heard, and like they are constantly being judged and evaluated, and are getting a bad grade. OP clearly feels invalidated, like he cannot be trusted as an expert in the things he knows. It\u2019s harder to judge how his fianc\u00e9 feels since we\u2019re only getting half of the story, but since he mentioned that her fact-checking behavior has escalated over time, I can\u2019t help but wonder why she feels an increasing need to fact check. Perhaps she is also feeling like her own knowledge or judgement is regularly dismissed or invalidated.", "Heres the thing, i dont explain everything, like maybe twice a month ill explain something to her.
