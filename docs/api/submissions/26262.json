My mother is a little over 70, has recently had a fall a year ago which has led her to be even more frail than she already was to begin with. My parents do not live in the same city as me. A couple months ago, I announced I was pregnant. It will be their first grandchild and so I understand the excitement. They immediately, without consulting with me, started making plans to move to my city stating that it would be so that my mother could help. Now, I know for a fact that my mother is not physically capable of helping out nor is she emotionally strong enough to see me in any sort of pain. Plus my Mom has a habit of forcing her ideas and beliefs on everyone. I also have a dog who makes it his sole task in life to bolt out the door every opportunity he gets. My husband and I are very careful with the front door but from past experiences, my parents are not at all. There have been numerous occasions where they have left the door wide open and this one time my fog ran away and I did not know till someone recognised him and came over to inform me. Now considering all this - I am not in a physical state to chase after my dog if he runs away, I don\u2019t want to worry about anyone else\u2019s feeling other than my own when I go into labour, I do not want to put my mother through any sort of emotional or physical trouble where she is trying to help me and I honestly just want this time to be about my husband, my dog and I as a family. Hence I know this was a bad idea from the start but I can\u2019t just outright tell them no because my parents are super emotional and will be extremely hurt. So i understand where OP is coming from.

You're planning your leave time for your own rest and relaxation, so it's understandable that you won't want to spend the entire week caring for and entertaining your mother.

You're not obligated to host your mother for the full week, especially if you have other plans, and if she finds it too much of a hassle, she can always choose to make other arrangements with her free time. It's totally fair for you to express your discomfort and set aside time for yourself during your leave.", "NTA however you just need to tell your mother.

Sheesh.", "She said that\u2019s arranged with a friend", "Uh   Brother put himself in the middle", "In a way yes. I don\u2019t expect her to guilt trip me about telling her not to come, but most definitely to be disappointed by me not wanting her around.", "Of course I did, several weeks ago when it was confirmed, and I told her it would\u2019ve been only a minor thing, not to worry, and that I will be on annual leave that week. \n\nSame thing I told my brother, minus the annual leave thing since he has an habit of organising my leave whenever I tell him I have days off.", "You remind me of my great aunt Betty and great uncle Harry. She made him meatloaf every week for his whole life. She hated making meatloaf, she hated the smell of meatloaf, she hated eating meatloaf. But he loved it so much that she just kept making it every week. And my sweet Uncle Harry, who totally hated meatloaf, kept eating her meatloaf every single week because she worked so hard on it just for him and he didn't want to hurt her feelings. These two were in their 70s when they figured out that neither one of them liked the fecking meatloaf!! Don't be like Aunt Betty and Uncle Harry. Your brother gave you an out, just own up to what you want. That way your mom can come when you two can hang out and do things together and you can drive her around to see the relatives. I promise it's not as hard as it seems.", "\"I don't need anything\" is non-committal. \"I have something else planned and I'd prefer for you to not be here\" is what OP told us they actually want - and what they are avoiding to say.", "Then tell her no", "My mom makes me crazy with this. For years every time I would post anything about having a cold or something on social media she would be all, \u201cI wish I could be there to take care of you! \u201c Um no, when I\u2019m sick I don\u2019t want anyone around and I\u2019m a grown ass adult, I don\u2019t need or want that. Same thing when I had surgery. She wanted to come up after, but at least had the sense to ask. She and my husband don\u2019t get along so having her here to \u201chelp\u201d would have been a nightmare. At some point parents need to realize that their children will eventually outgrow wanting them around for things like illness or recovery. \n\nDo yourself a favor, tell your mom you appreciate that she would come out to help out but that really you would prefer to be alone to rest and recover.", "Best intention and worst execution is a great phrase. I'm putting  it into my vocabulary.", "No it's not. How is \"I don't need anything\" non committal? It seems very short and to the point. I DON'T NEED ANYTHING. How much more clear does someone need to be? OP stated that's what they told their family.", "Just tell her not to come, you\u2019ve already made plans for your recuperation", "I don\u00ect know how to explain it in an even simpler way. \"I don't need anything\" is not a statement of actually preferring to be alone. It leaves space to interpretation. \"I don't need anything but I don't mind if you come\". \"I don't need anything but I won't say no to extra help\". \"I don't need anything, actually I do but I'm just saying that to not seem like I'm burdening you\".\n\nCompare it to the possible interpretations of \"I have my own plans so don't visit.\"", "I don't need anything. I interpret that as,  you are all set. If you are at a restaurant and you have finished your meal and have paid the bill when the server says \"Do you need anything else\", to which you reply \"I don't need anything\" they should take that to mean open anther check, bring back the menu, alert the bartender and the kitchen staff you are clearly staying for a while! Is that about right? You can leave your \"interpretations\" to yourself. It sounds like YOU have any issue with things being simpler. You are the one adding all the extras. I don't need anything means just that. No means no!", "I mean, I guess. I don't have any brothers but since you are making a broad generalization...."]}
