I think that's reasonable.", "NTA, I'd be massively pissed about that", "NTA and I\u2019ll tell you why from my own personal experience. My mother is a little over 70, has recently had a fall a year ago which has led her to be even more frail than she already was to begin with. My parents do not live in the same city as me. A couple months ago, I announced I was pregnant. It will be their first grandchild and so I understand the excitement. They immediately, without consulting with me, started making plans to move to my city stating that it would be so that my mother could help. Now, I know for a fact that my mother is not physically capable of helping out nor is she emotionally strong enough to see me in any sort of pain. Plus my Mom has a habit of forcing her ideas and beliefs on everyone. I also have a dog who makes it his sole task in life to bolt out the door every opportunity he gets. My husband and I are very careful with the front door but from past experiences, my parents are not at all. There have been numerous occasions where they have left the door wide open and this one time my fog ran away and I did not know till someone recognised him and came over to inform me. Now considering all this - I am not in a physical state to chase after my dog if he runs away, I don\u2019t want to worry about anyone else\u2019s feeling other than my own when I go into labour, I do not want to put my mother through any sort of emotional or physical trouble where she is trying to help me and I honestly just want this time to be about my husband, my dog and I as a family. Hence I know this was a bad idea from the start but I can\u2019t just outright tell them no because my parents are super emotional and will be extremely hurt. So i understand where OP is coming from. Definitely NTA for not wanting her Mother to visit to \u201chelp out\u201d and definitely NTA for finding it difficult to tell her outright not to come over.", "NTA. Tell Mom \u201cwhile I do appreciate your desire to come help, I\u2019ve already got everything lined up.

You're planning your leave time for your own rest and relaxation, so it's understandable that you won't want to spend the entire week caring for and entertaining your mother. Your brother should have asked for your permission before assuming that you'd be OK with his plans. You're not obligated to host your mother for the full week, especially if you have other plans, and if she finds it too much of a hassle, she can always choose to make other arrangements with her free time. It's totally fair for you to express your discomfort and set aside time for yourself during your leave.", "NTA however you just need to tell your mother. You don\u2019t want her here right now so just tell her. If your entire relationship can be destroyed with one simple no then it wasn\u2019t a very good relationship to begin with.", "NAH, but please make sure that you do have a backup plan for care if the surgery doesn't go well.
