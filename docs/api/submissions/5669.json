If you have night blindness and she knowingly tried to make you drive alone after dark, that\u00b4s attempted murder.", "**NTA Part II**  \nSister is an AH though  \nI went through a scenario similar that I actually went through. Had I known what would have happened would have immediately lied & would be away with friends/family.  \nI thought was helping out a good friend with a ride to the Amtrak train station (Penn Station NYC). She had planned to see relatives in the deep South.   \nWhy she didn't track to see if there were cheap or comparable airline tickets don't know. After this went down, found there were actually cheaper tickets than what she had spent on train ticket(s). Oh well, that was a warning.  \nShe doesn't drive so I innocently said yes. It's important to note she asked me a month in advance, because this would be a few days right before Thanksgiving.  \n1. She didn't know how to get the train schedules as it had been years traveled.   \n 1. Keep in mind this is NYC's Penn Station which has the most train departures than smaller stations in area  \n  1. Many don't know that Penn Station is what I term a connecting start. Many take it to transfer in Philly or DC to other trains. That means there are 'multiple' trains that leave that can connect to the destination train that leaves in a few hours.   \n  2. Means can catch 3-4 trains from Penn throughout the day & arrive at the DC station still be able to catch the train leaves later. (She didn't know I knew that)   \n 2. She selected a specific morning departure (10am) which was favorable I thought for her train connection. I didn't know when the next train would depart.  \n2. Doesn't drive so wasn't sure how long it would take to drive to Penn Station  \n 1. I used to work in the NYC but then worked remotely. My friend lived in the same apartment complex.   \n  1. It depends on time/day/season   \n 2. Least congestion late @ night takes 45 minutes from where live. Estimating departure time & driving in city during holidays, I added 1\u00bd hours (2 hours 15 mins) especially for unexpected delays. Which meant we needed to leave by her place at least 3 hours to get there in order to buy tickets.  \n  2. That meant needed to leave by 7am and I tell friend this  \n3. It may seem as if I'm over organized, I'm not.  \n 1. I've been someone who all my life tended to sleep in, or procrastinate to point, missed school buses & college classes (No wasn't partying rather had found to have iron deficiency & anemia was fatigued most of time. Took years find source of condition)  \n 2. Knowing this, I try to improve & not have issues (showering, packing, ironing or whatever late afternoon/night before, set 2 alarms & make sure phone isn't on mute & charging). I even set my clocks in my car & house 35 minutes ahead.  \n  1. I wanted to ensure I was at my best to take my friend to the train without blaming it on my issues.   \n4. PROBLEM: I discovered my friend was far, far worse than me.  \n 1. I later found out being older than me, she has burned her bridges with neighbors & friends because of her narcissistic & entitled behavior. She had with me because of this & another episode.  \n 2. She believes having grown up around NYC she knew better than me how much time it will take to get to Penn Station.  \n  1. Although hadn't lived in Brooklyn for over 30 years, nor ever commuted by subway, drove into the City, or ever went to Penn Station.  \n  2. She was convinced she was more knowledgeable than me and thought that I was ridiculously too early to drive in & was going to ignore me. (Keep this in mind)  \n 3. DAY before used 3 ways (voicemail, text & talking directly with her) to confirm still needs a ride & time of pickup. She states yes & knows the time will pick her up (although secretly going to ignore it).  \n  1. Important to note, I'm taking time away from my work to do this. I'm flexing my hours. I figure if start at 11am can complete my deadlines by the next day to submit. (Ended up working through the night to do so)  \nFinally, I snapped.  \n  \\- Told her she cost herself the missed train left literally 45 minutes after told her because she took so much time diddling & dallying. If had been ready would have made it.  \n  \\- I can't overcome time & congestion escaping bumper-to-bumper traffic in some areas due to the city holiday season by being a speeding demon! Am I supposed to run over these vehicles with my car?   \n  \\- Driving farther away from the city means extra time needed to get into the city I no longer had from her procrastination.  \n  \\- She knew very well hadn't told me daughters were coming along but waited until last minute to spring it on me  \n  \\- Driving to them cost her time she never considered in her estimation Proved right for setting the time so ridiculously early as we aren't minutes but hours late.  \n  \\- Lastly, told her that would be the very last time she ever got a ride. It wasn't worth my aggravation, time & effort.  \n \\- Knowing what I know, forced friend (ex) to get out & go into Penn Station & ask for another train time.   \n  \\- She managed to buy tickets for another departure which surprised her.  Next one was at 1pm. 1 1/2 hours to wait to catch the train & still enough time to connect with the other.  \n  \\- She should have made arrangements for that time than the earlier departure then again, most likely have missed that too.  \n  \\- Kicked my Friend out of my car, as expected/assumed would wait while sitting in my car. She got out with her daughters (suitcases in tow) & went into Penn Station to wait   \n \\- I was so mad & infuriated how my time was taken in the day.   \n  \\-   I spent literally a freakin' day dealing with ex-friend's antics!  \n  \\- I got back by 3pm instead of 11-12pm (easier to get out than in).  \n  \\- She ignored me when told her best time to drive in to catch a train, taking her sweet time ignoring me making herself breakfast, packing & getting ready then surprised at how much traffic encountered (really?)  \n  \\- She manipulated & abused my goodwill not only picking her up late but then both daughters  \n  \\- Talked about my car & how inadequate it was (beggars can't be choosy)  \n  \\- I wasted almost 1/2 tank of dealing with driving over tarnation", "NTA. Sister could have gotten a room near the airport and used long term parking. Sister may also need to learn to pack more efficiently.", "NTA.

Specifically, \"Let's not leave until the time it starts getting too dark for you to see.\"\n\nShe planned that in advance. She knew if she asked you to pick them up at 4:30 you would have said \"no.\" You might have suggested she ask your husband to drive them instead.\n\nI would have given them until 3:15 to get in the car before driving off.", "&#x200B;\n\n**Point of story?**\n\n**You missed a bullet of aggravation, narcissistic entitlement & illogical timing. If it takes 2 hours to get to the airport, doesn't mean should take 2 hours!**  \n\n**Boarding isn't the time of departure! It's typically set a 1/2 ahead of departure.

Then adjust time to go through TSA security which can take depending on popular time/flights up to an hour. That's 4pm!**\n\n**Sister was cleaning her house at the agreed upon time to leave? Then stalled using various excuses of the luggage which fit in the trunk regarding your husband driving.**\n\n**Not thinking or caring you might drive slower at night? Stupid & foolish! 2 hours plus processing is 3 hours.** ***How fast does she think you can do it, or does she plan on driving or her boyfriend?

As stated, if she assumed boarding is the same time as flight departure, doesn't give time to have luggage checked, go through security will definitely miss a flight especially around the holidays when air travel is full! She blew it when was cleaning her house, anytime of day & does it then?
