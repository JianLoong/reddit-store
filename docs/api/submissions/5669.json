SHE CAUSED IT ON HERSELF!***\n\nI went through a scenario similar that I actually went through. Had I known what would have happened would have immediately lied & said would be away with friends/family.\n\nI thought was helping out a good friend with a ride to the Amtrak train station (Penn Station NYC). She had planned to see relatives in the deep South.\n\nWhy she didn't track to see if there were cheap or comparable airline tickets don't know. After this went down, found there were actually cheaper tickets than what she had spent on train ticket(s). ***Oh well, that was a warning.***\n\nShe doesn't drive so I innocently said yes. It's important to note she asked me a month in advance, because this would be a few days right before Thanksgiving.\n\n1. **She didn't know how to get the train schedules as it had been years traveled.**\n   1. Keep in mind this is NYC's Penn Station which has the most train departures than smaller stations in area\n   2. Many don't know that Penn Station is what I term a connecting start. Many take it to transfer in Philly or DC to other trains. That means there are 'multiple' trains that leave that can connect to the destination train that leaves in a few hours.\n   3. Means can catch 3-4 trains from Penn throughout the day & arrive at the DC station still be able to catch the train leaves later. (*She didn't know I knew that*)\n2. **She selected a specific morning departure (10am) which was favorable**\n   1. I thought for her train connection. I didn't know when the next train would depart.\n3. **Doesn't drive so wasn't sure how long it would take to drive to Penn Station**\n   1. I used to work in the NYC but then worked remotely. My friend lived in the same apartment complex.\n   2. It depends on time/day/season\n      1. Least congestion late @ night takes 45 minutes from where live. Estimating departure time & driving in city during holidays, I added 1\u00bd hours (2 hours 15 mins) especially for unexpected delays.\n      2. Which meant we needed to leave by her place at least 3 hours ahead to get there in order to buy tickets.\n      3. That meant needed to leave by 7am and I tell friend this\n4. **It may seem as if I'm over organized, I'm not.**\n   1. I've been someone who all my life tended to sleep in, or procrastinate to point, missed school buses & college classes (No wasn't partying rather had found to have iron deficiency & anemia was fatigued most of time. Took years find source of condition)\n   2. Knowing this, I try to improve & not have issues (showering, packing, ironing or whatever late afternoon/night before, set 2 alarms & make sure phone isn't on mute & charging). I even set my clocks in my car & house 35 minutes ahead.\n   3. I wanted to ensure I was at my best to take my friend to the train without blaming it on my issues.\n5. **PROBLEM: I discovered my friend was far, far worse than me**\n   1. Later, I found out being older than me, she has burned her bridges with neighbors & friends because of her narcissistic & entitled behavior. She had with me because of this & another episode.\n      1. She believed having grown up around NYC she knew better than me how much time it will take to get to Penn Station.\n      2. Despite facts hadn't lived in Brooklyn for over 30 years, nor ever commuted by subway, drove into the City, or ever went to Penn Station.\n      3. She was convinced she was more knowledgeable than me thinking ***I was ridiculously too early to drive in & was going to ignore me***. (*Keep this in mind*)\n6. **DAY before** **used 3 ways (voicemail, text & talking directly with her) to confirm still needs a ride & time of pickup.**\n   1. She states yes & knows the time will pick her up (*although secretly going to ignore it*).\n   2. **Important to note**, *I'm flexing my hours, taking time away from my work to do this.* I figure if start at 11am can complete my deadlines by the next day to submit. (*Ended up working through the night to do so*)\n   3. Owned a 2003 Ford Focus (larger than versions now), it fit*s* comfortably 4 people & had a larger trunk that split through. My work product I kept in the trunk to do surveys & appraisals along with an extra spare was fixed. I had gone out on an appraisal that day so didn't feel like cleaning out the trunk. Being it was only my friend, assumed could use backseat to put her luggage on.\n   4. ***Got up early. Showered, dressed & went out to get gas by 5:30am***\n      1. I started calling her @ 6am a full hour before supposed to leave. She didn't answer.\n      2. Friend has a heart problem & grew worried & concerned not answering. I rushed over to her apartment banging on her door.\n      3. She finally answered the door. Apparently had slept in. Confused I watched as she made herself breakfast then lazily went to get ready. She hadn't packed, had anything prepped to pack, then took a shower!\n      4. She actually rebuffed me when reminded her we needed to get on the road! She thought it was *ridiculously early to leave at that time and 'decided' to go when she thought!* ***That was my first insane moment!***\n      5. ***We left at 7:45 am. Although later than planned, I thought since had put in a*** ***buffer*** ***still had time to make it.***\n   5. **WRONGLY THOUGHT STILL ON TIME, OH NO NOT IN THE LEAST!**\n      1. ***She conveniently forgot to tell me that her daughters were going too & had to pick them up! WHAT!*** *Never told me in over a month about them!*\n      2. They lived opposite sides of area further north of friend! I could have picked them up while friend was getting ready as she's the closest one that lived towards NYC.\n      3. ***No in her foolishness, not thinking about the time it would take, thought she could be in the car while I picked them up. What part of extra time is going to what you miss it don't you get?***\n   6. **Picked up daughters**\n      1. They were ready thank goodness, but it packed on a lot more time.\n      2. Each of them had huge suitcases which I barely managed to put in my trunk trying to avoid damaging my stuff. Friend's luggage had to fit in the back between them. ***Friend wasn't pleased.***\n   7. **Friend starts complaining about my car being inadequate & my driving**\n      1. Excuse me, beggars can't be choosy. Friend's telling me at the last-minute daughters are coming along too, expecting me to have chosen a larger luxury car for her? Who's making the car payments her or me? I was single at the time & chose a smaller car for gas & maintenance. ***2nd thing made me ready to dump her***\n      2. Repeated I told her that traffic & season would cause delays especially farther away are to drive in. Sure, enough encountered bumper to bumper traffic with no let up. She was shocked & angered I had gotten into the traffic. I kept my mouth shut.\n   8. **Missed 10am departure arriving @ 11:30am**\n      1. ***'ex' friend started screaming at me blaming me for the catastrophe.***\n\n**Finally, I snapped.**\n\n* ***Told her she cost herself the missed train left literally 45 minutes after told her because she took so much time diddling & dallying. If had been ready would have made it.***\n* ***I can't overcome time & congestion escaping bumper-to-bumper traffic in some areas due to the city holiday season by being a speeding demon! Was I supposed to run over these vehicles with my car?***\n* ***Driving farther away from the city means extra time needed to get into the city I no longer had from her procrastination.***\n* ***She knew very well hadn't told me daughters were coming along but waited until last minute to spring it on me***\n* ***Driving to them cost her more time she never considered in \"her estimation\". Proved me right for setting the time \"so ridiculously early\" as put it. Were we minutes late? NO HOURS!***\n* ***Lastly, told her that would be the very last time she ever got a ride from it. It wasn't worth my aggravation, time & effort.***\n\nKnowing what I know, I argued & forced my now 'ex' friend to get out & go into Penn Station & ask for another train time.\n\nShe managed to buy tickets for another departure time which surprised her.  Next one was at 1pm. 1 1/2 hours to wait & catch the train still having enough time to connect with the other train to her destination.\n\nShe should have made arrangements for that time than the earlier departure then again, most likely have missed that one too with her *ridiculous too early thoughts.*\n\nAfter knew she booked the tickets, I kicked my Friend out of my car. Somehow her attitude expected/assumed would wait while sitting in my car at Penn station not knowing I could get ticketed.\n\nShe got out with her daughters (suitcases in tow) & went into Penn Station to wait for only about an hour.\n\n**I was so mad & infuriated how my time was taken in the day**\n\n* **I spent literally a freakin' day dealing with ex-friend's antics!**\n   * I got back by 3pm instead of 11-12pm (easier to get out than in)\n      * She ignored me when told her best time to drive in to catch a train, taking her sweet time ignoring me making herself breakfast, packing & getting ready then, surprised at how much traffic encountered (really?)\n      * She manipulated & abused my goodwill waiting on her being late but then both daughters\n      * Talked about my car & how inadequate it was (beggars can't be choosy)\n      * I wasted almost 1/2 tank of dealing with driving over tarnation", "NTA.
