He did this because he knew that you were going to say no and he had tried to trick you into doing it. And not only did he expect you to do it but you also weren't getting paid to do for it! You aren't the asshole but your husband is. He got what he deserved.", "NTA.  Asking someone while they are half asleep is a dick move and I question whether or not he actually asked if you don't remember anything about it.", "NTA. It sounds like he asked you when you were half asleep for a reason. He was hoping just springing this on you would work and it didn't. He can be as upset as he wants but he did this to himself.

Waiting until 2 AM to ask you was inappropriate, and he knows it.  Plus, I'm suspicious that it even happened.  What parent was still waiting around at 2 AM the night before to hear about childcare and then was ready to go in the morning?  Sounds to me like he said yes before he even asked you.\n\nAt best, he tried to pull a sneaky move to get you to watch a kid. It failed.  At worst, he told the coworker yes without talking to you and tried to cover.  Either way, that's on him, so he can watch the kid plus his own two children, who he should be used to caring for anyway.", "NTA He tried to trick you and got what he deserved.

Does he often ask you to do stuff when you aren't fully functional from sleep brain?   And why would he wait until 2:00am the day before to ask you to babysit?
