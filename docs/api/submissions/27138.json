I think my senses have started to come back to me!\" Maybe not as dramatic but yeah somewhere along those lines.", "I have hyperhidrosis too, so I know how your boyfriend feels. It sucks, and it\u2019s very hard to feel comfortable or to let intimacy happen when you are so insecure about it. Your telling him you couldnt smell obviously helped him feel better, so IMO it was worthwhile and he shouldnt be mad about it if you tell him now. Just tell him. If he\u2019s mad, that\u2019s silly.\n\nAnyway, as you clearly understand, hyperhidrosis fkn sucks and it leads to all kinda of insecurities and paranoia. So just some unrelated advice for the future: Even if you dont care about this stuff, try to remember its a very big deal for him and it might make him wary of going out on hot days, going for long walks, or hanging out in hot crowded bars. So if you really want to do one of those things and he is reticent, please don\u2019t be pushy. Let him stay home. Also help him to avoid handshakes whenever possible: introduce him from afar, etc.\n\nAlso fun fact Robin Williams had hyperhidrosis and was extremely insecure about it, would apologize to other actors he was working with if they had to hug for a scene, etc. I loved him for many reasons but this was the icing on the cake for me when I found out.
