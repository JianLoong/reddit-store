And it's wrong to involve your family etc. in the lie.  \n\nPeople who really have no sense of smell can't really enjoy food, because tastebuds only tell you sweet, sour, salty and bitter--smell provides the rest.

It smells wonderful... and sniff out something that smells really good .. maybe him right out of the shower, candle food whatever... and say maybe you're getting you're smell back.. say they smell good.. etc \nMy oldest is a sweater too and doesn't smell unless he had a hard workout or hadn't had a shower in a few days. Just cuz you sweat doesn't mean you stink. I live in az... everyone sweats lol", "NAH. It probably wasn't a smart move to expand the scope of the lie, but also if you think your sense of smell isn't that important it might be less of a lie than you thought. Honestly, it's not that bad because this came from a place of caring, but this is very much going to be something that is hard to maintain for a really long time unless you actually do have something wrong with your sniffer, so it might be prudent to have your sense of smell come back at some point and just tell him you don't think he smells bad. Very much avoid phrases like \"it's not that bad\", because that still means it is bad.", "YTA\n\n>honestly life is the same because you don't even use smell that much\n\nThis isn't accurate if you actually talked with people who can't smell. It totally changed the experience of basically all foods and people experience major problems of either loss of desire to eat or overeating trying to satisfy the craving for prior experiences. It can lead some people to become depressed.\n\nAnd yeah, lying for 3 years is sketchy as fuck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
