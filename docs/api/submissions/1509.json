She's had it ever since then, even now after the breakup, only reason she still has it is because she bought a game on my account while we were still dating and I had promised to let her keep my home Xbox on her console and have upheld that promise despite everything. I don't really like her as a person anymore, and I have definitely lost interest since we broke up but decided to keep said promise as I didn't have any reason not to.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, the person I have been talking to wanted to get my home Xbox onto their console so we could both play gamepass games together. So I messaged my ex on Discord as that was really the only place I could contact her (We had cut contact with eachother after the breakup). I did so and asked if I could switch it, and lied saying I wanted it for my own console, she asked if she could keep it as she still played the game she bought regularly (game is BO3 so understandable) I said she could as I could just buy gamepass for $1 anyway.\n\nThen today I wasn't expecting anything really and got the urge to check her Instagram story. I did so and to my surprise, she had seemingly bought a bunch of packs of Pokemon cards. Which made me realize that she probably had the money to just get BO3 herself. I found out, going off how many packs I was able to see that she had spent maybe $56-$70 on all of them. Which was almost enough or more than enough to get it herself. \n\nShe may have gotten them from someone but I was simply going off of what I saw and either way I knew she had money.\n\nNow yes she was the one who bought the game in the first place but for starters she bought as a \"for us\" type thing as she couldn't gameshare back as I had been borrowing my dads as he had a bunch of add-ons for a game I play regularly.

I may be taking away my home Xbox from my ex and giving it to someone else despite the fact that my ex had spent $60 on a game using my account. \n2. The action might make me the asshole as I would in a sense be stealing that game from her and ontop of that taking back that I had told her I wouldn't take it away. I would also be breaking a promise and I like keeping promises no matter who the person may be.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

NTA for getting back your account... its yours. My youngest just had this issue but replace the xbox with steam. I got the account back and secured off the ex and they were offered the game they bought reimbursed (11 bucks game) they got sooooo pissy about it. I shut that down HARD and told them they just lost that offer. For someone who \"wouldn't be afford to replace it for months\" the daft head went and bought 30 quid on another steam game. It's just one of those teenage relationship break up things that's normal now I guess. Least offer to pay to replace it on thier own account, that really all you can do", "Yes, YWBTA. Doesn't matter if she could have bought the game instead of cards. She already purchased the game with her money, it's just inconveniently on your xbox. So give her the money so she can buy the game and be done with it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, you did make a promise that she would be able to continue using that game. You should just pay her back the money (or 50% of it, if she did in fact intend the game to be a gift). Just because she bought something else for herself doesn't mean you can go back on your promise.", "Thinking about doing this also. Sadly idk if Microsoft has that sort of thing so i would have to give her the full $60, I may just let her keep it, she's not the type to try and use my account the get more games using my card. If she does well I can easily prove she was the one stealing money basically because of billing history. Plus if she gets the game herself she would likely let me know.", "I think just keeping my home Xbox on hers is easier for both of us. I only have to spend a dollar for game pass for the person and then she can take care of the rest of the payments. It's also easier because I wouldn't have to give her money for something I realize that i could care less about. Knowing her she might just buy it herself later which saves me the trouble. But yeah I agree with basically everything you said, even if she did wrong me I chose to keep the promise and also it was her money, both for the game and the cards, she can do whatever she wants with her money especially since we are split up.", "I think I might just let her keep it, it's annoying that she could've just bought the game herself but I was the one who decided to keep the promise, gamepass for the person I'm talking to is currently that one time $1 thing so I might aswell just do that. Ontop of that you are right, despite the fact that she could've gotten it herself, it was a gift type thing and also she has full reign of what she does with her money.", "It's still legally yours and your legal Microsoft  ID. Steam won't transfer titles between accounts but you could see if Microsoft can. End of the day this is your identity.", "Did some looking, can't find anything about whether or not MS would help. Either way might just give her money so she can buy it on her own or just keep home xbox as is. I am going to be securing my Microsoft account though just in case. Appreciate the advice, it's always nice to get an adult or even outside perspective on this sorta thing."]}
