Worst thing for a child is having a parent that's not ready to commit the parents life to raising a child.  \n\nNow, if you want a child but simply are afraid of XYZ, let me comfort you.  Every child is different.  Your parents are enabling your brother.  That doesn't have to be you and your child.  It's quite possible you won't have the same challenges with your child you parents have with your brother.  Make no mistake, there will be challenges.  99% chance they'll have their own unique twist on making your life interesting, however.", "NTA. You can choose to have or not have kids and don\u2019t need to justify yourself. But I am curious. You said your parents tried to do everything t to get your brother to work. Did they ever try just not giving him money and providing for him?", "NTA. \n\nSounds like you don\u2019t want children for more reasons than just your brother. Stand firm and don\u2019t let your parents argue with you about it. It\u2019s really not their business if you have children or not nor is your reasoning.\n\nYour brother is the AH. Screw him and his feelings. What a lazy, worthless human whose plan is to mooch of your folks then someone else. Your parents are enabling his behavior and that doesn\u2019t do anyone any favors. He will never feel good about himself until he gets off his ass and goes to work. Not your problem and neither are his feelings.", "I shouldn't be surprised by the y-t-a's, but here I am.\n\nWas what you said insulting toward your brother? Maybe.

Your parents pressed in a public space. They should have just accepted your answer and pressed later in private, if they wanted.\n\nYour brother is insulted. Good. Maybe he'll finally grow up. If he doesn't want people to have a negative view of him, he should contribute something to the household.", "NTA\n\nHe's been enabled.

He's not the one who will shape them, you are.", "NTA.\n\nAlso it\u2019s not hard to parent a child. Your parents are just bad at it. You just have to show an adult child some tough love sometimes aka kicking them out to force them to get a job.", "Funny that the leech get butthurted by the truth, one would think that to be like that you wouldn't have a piece of dignity.", "Boo hoo\u2026The TRUTH hurts\u2026\n\nMaybe you did your brother and parents an unintentional favor and a kick in the ass!\n\nSo very NTA here.", "NTA. He needed to hear it, and your parents need to cut him off. They might be lovely ppl, but they've cultivated this behavior from him.\n\nHere's the thing. Every child is different,  but the parent stays the same. They've made choices that have enabled your brother. It doesn't mean you will make the same choices. This means that you are a parent, not a friend.  A parent first and when they become adults, hopefully friend second. Too many parents these days give their kids everything without consequences or accountability.  Here's a car, oh you smashed it. Here's another one. Do you have any idea how many teenagers are unaware how to budget,  clean, or cook for themselves? The entitlement runs deep for not just this generation but many before it. It mostly has to do with parents wanting to give children everything they couldn't have, but they aren't taught to appreciate it. \n\nYou could be a great patent if you are aware of the pitfalls. But no one is perfect. Shit happens, and kids are also shaped by the outside environment you have no control in or can be present for. \n\nBut being child free csn also be great. But don't decide something out of fear. It could become one of your greatest regrets.", "NTA you spoke the truth. Saying sorry won't erase it. He can fix everything by becoming and adult and getting a job. This is on him not on you. He's made his choice of how to live his life, if he wants it to be different then he needs to change it. \nYou'll notice that previous sentence had He not you....this is about him not you.", "NTA, they demanded an answer. You gave it. \n\nWould have been better to say that this isn't the time to talk about this though. The only thing to possibly apologize for is for extended family members overhearing, like the cousin your brother was speaking with. Since he heard it, then the cousin probably did too.", "NTA. They asked and wouldn't take your evasions. It's not your fault that they pushed you to be honest and then were unhappy with what they heard.\n\nThough personally, I don't agree with your reasoning; why, because your parents didn't do a good job with your brother, would that mean you might also do a poor job of raising a child? It's not a condition that's inherited. That said, if you're not that interested in having children, for whatever reason, that's fine too.\n\nI don't know what you can do about yr brother situation though. I've known families where, if the adult son/daughter didn't have a job, they were kicked out of the house. Tough love. Sometimes that's what it takes. But it doesn't sound like your parents are up to that kind of thing. Family counseling is the only thing I can think of. \n\nI don't know that I'd apologize either. That's how you feel. And it doesn't sound like you have a close relationship with him anyway. Maybe if he says anything you can be honest about how you feel, like how you phrased things here.", "NTA you explained yourself clearly and your parents kept pressing you until you finally had to say something you didn't want to.", "NTA", "NTA\nI feel sorry for your brother because I guess he's suffering in general because of his situation. But sometimes hard words like this can help persons to change their life. My family is full of persons with mental problems. I noticed in my family: The more you hide these problems in a family, the less they will be able to solve them.\n\nSad fates like suicide & cancer are present in my family, but I am not scared to have children. I hope my kids will be happy to be alive. I will be able to show them how they can have a happy life even when their life isn't perfect. I don't care which jobs they have.", "NTA", "NTA for not wanting kids and your reasoning behind it.\n\nYTA for disrespecting your brother right in front of him. Apologize to him, but have a sit down conversation to explain to him how you're feeling, why you said what you did and how it effects you. That you want to see him do better for himself instead of using your parents as a crutch.", "Yta for saying something hurtful in front of your brother. Your reasons are valid,  but at 30 you're old enough to have shut this down. You could have said something along the lines of,  Now isn't really an appropriate time to discuss this Mom.", "Um. YTA. \n\nIn my opinion anyway. You never need to give a reason as to your family planning decisions. Setting a boundary with your parents won\u2019t do any harm in this matter. \n\nBut your comments (whether true or not) were harmful to others and they didn\u2019t need to be said. Especially at a family gathering and in front of him. \n\nTime and place make more effective conversations. Talking to your parents privately about your concerns or a private conversation with your brother as to why he thinks it\u2019s appropriate.", "YTA\n\nYou unintentionally hurt his feelings and need to apologize. There is zero indication that you will have to support your brother so there is no reason for you to be part of the coddling decision.", "Your thinking is wrong, just because your brother is the way he is, it doesn't mean your children will do the same in the long future. What you said about him is correct but I think you shouldn't have said it this way and even if you apologize that won't change anything really. Maybe you four need to have a chat on this matter.", "soft YTA because your parents might have felt inadequate when it\u2019s their son they should be ashamed of. Not themselves.
