Worst thing for a child is having a parent that's not ready to commit the parents life to raising a child.  \n\nNow, if you want a child but simply are afraid of XYZ, let me comfort you.  Every child is different.  Your parents are enabling your brother.  That doesn't have to be you and your child.

Every child is different,  but the parent stays the same. They've made choices that have enabled your brother. It doesn't mean you will make the same choices. This means that you are a parent, not a friend.  A parent first and when they become adults, hopefully friend second. Too many parents these days give their kids everything without consequences or accountability.  Here's a car, oh you smashed it. Here's another one. Do you have any idea how many teenagers are unaware how to budget,  clean, or cook for themselves? The entitlement runs deep for not just this generation but many before it. It mostly has to do with parents wanting to give children everything they couldn't have, but they aren't taught to appreciate it. \n\nYou could be a great patent if you are aware of the pitfalls.

It's not a condition that's inherited. That said, if you're not that interested in having children, for whatever reason, that's fine too.\n\nI don't know what you can do about yr brother situation though. I've known families where, if the adult son/daughter didn't have a job, they were kicked out of the house. Tough love. Sometimes that's what it takes. But it doesn't sound like your parents are up to that kind of thing. Family counseling is the only thing I can think of. \n\nI don't know that I'd apologize either. That's how you feel. And it doesn't sound like you have a close relationship with him anyway. Maybe if he says anything you can be honest about how you feel, like how you phrased things here.", "NTA you explained yourself clearly and your parents kept pressing you until you finally had to say something you didn't want to.", "NTA", "NTA\nI feel sorry for your brother because I guess he's suffering in general because of his situation.
