Worst thing for a child is having a parent that's not ready to commit the parents life to raising a child.  \n\nNow, if you want a child but simply are afraid of XYZ, let me comfort you.  Every child is different.  Your parents are enabling your brother.  That doesn't have to be you and your child.

Every child is different,  but the parent stays the same. They've made choices that have enabled your brother. It doesn't mean you will make the same choices. This means that you are a parent, not a friend.  A parent first and when they become adults, hopefully friend second. Too many parents these days give their kids everything without consequences or accountability.  Here's a car, oh you smashed it. Here's another one. Do you have any idea how many teenagers are unaware how to budget,  clean, or cook for themselves? The entitlement runs deep for not just this generation but many before it. It mostly has to do with parents wanting to give children everything they couldn't have, but they aren't taught to appreciate it. \n\nYou could be a great patent if you are aware of the pitfalls.

It's not a condition that's inherited. That said, if you're not that interested in having children, for whatever reason, that's fine too.\n\nI don't know what you can do about yr brother situation though. I've known families where, if the adult son/daughter didn't have a job, they were kicked out of the house. Tough love. Sometimes that's what it takes. But it doesn't sound like your parents are up to that kind of thing. Family counseling is the only thing I can think of. \n\nI don't know that I'd apologize either. That's how you feel. And it doesn't sound like you have a close relationship with him anyway.

Like um no ma\u2019am don\u2019t compare me to you", "I was always told to graduate high school, go to college, marry then have kids. I thought that was how life was supposed to be. I think a lot of people think that, and it might not be how everyone\u2019s life is supposed to go. It would be nice if society could be more flexible on that kind of stuff. Not everyone\u2019s life is going to look the same, which is okay.", "potential, hypothetical children. not eventual.", "He doesn't need to hit rock bottom, he just has to realize people would *let* him if he does nothing. \n\n\nGranted, for some people it would take hitting a rock to get the hint.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "With your thoughts, it sounds like the older brother COULD benefit from therapy if he really wanted to move on from mom and dad taking care of him.", "What does Down Syndrome have to do with this?", "Wow, it's like you're describing my life LOL. Happens all the time in reality, especially when we're talking boy and girl.", "Even if that's true, that doesn't mean the parents have to allow their adult son to be a mooch. They are the ones in control, or at least they should be the ones in control. If they have allowed it, it's still a choice they made. Genetics may load the gun, but the parents pulled the trigger.", "That's just so Incorrect realistically. I actually do not know one person with siblings who was treated the same by their parents. \n\nMy mother was expected to act perfectly no matter what and had heavy pressure on her at all points, but due to her living mostly up to those standards was the golden child. My aunt, who's 5 years younger, was never expected to succeed never had those expectations and was always treated as a problem.\n\nMy friend was up until the age of 18 the golden child. So much so that while he got to pick his own high school to attend, he also go to kick his younger brother out of the same school half way through his first year there because he \"annoyed him too much.\" (I swear he's grown up now, I'm not friends with this person) But his younger sister was even more spoiled, she could do wrong. To the point when they found out she knew about sex at 13 years older they threatened to kick friend out of the house because \"there's no way she could find out herself\" (she had a phone, and sex ed lessons but anyway).\n\nEven in my own family, which I'd say my parents do try their best to be as fair as possible, there are huge differences. When I had my first partner they were never allowed to stay the night, they were only allowed to visit my house once every two weeks, and my mother was the first one to suggest condoms to me. My sisters is less then two years younger then me, at the exact same age her partner is allowed over every weekend and they sleep in the same bed. But her bedroom door has to stay open (mine never did) and she had to put up with a huge lecture when she asked for birth control before she got a yes.\n\nAlmost every parent treats their kids differently, and that's not always abusive or even weird. My examples were just the first extremes I could think of. Parents generally do try to keep equity, but even in a 1 year age gap there's so much learning done that children just aren't gonna be treated the same. Plus the individual child is different too. Your not gonna trust a drug addicted child to go to a party the same way you would one who's sworn off all alcohol even when you as the parent offer it. That's again, an extreme, but it applies to little things too."]}
