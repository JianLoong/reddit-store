I date occasionally but no long term relationships. This is due to many reasons like I love my freedom, I want to enjoy my life unencumbered with responsibilities and want to really focus on my career. \n\nMy older brother (M34) got married when he was 26. He has two kids (F7, F4). They had a traditional household. He wanted a partner who stayed home and looked after the family while he earned. She had apparently dreamed of being a homemaker and taking care of children. \n\nBut during last couple of years she showed signs of hating it. She wanted to study more and work outside. Build something of her own. But my brother refused to step up or help. I warned him once but he told me it's none of my business how he runs his household. I kept my mouth shut since. \n\nHis wife left him a month ago. She just wrote him a letter saying she can't do this and want to explore her life. She left kids with him and basically vanished. We have no idea where she is and it appears neither does her family. \n\nThing is my brother doesn't know how to do even the most basic things. He is the kind of guy who never changed a diaper or toasted bread. The moment my brother found that his wife left, he called my mother who rushed in to save the day.  She thought it was short term and my SIL would be back, but she hasn't. My father is unwell and needs her home soon. They live hours away. \n\nMy brother suggested she take kids home with her. My dad said no. He is retired and they are both getting old. He does not want to have kids in the house full time, taking up her time and energy. \n\nSince that was a no go, my brother asked me to either move in with them to help out or take kids in with me. I refused.\n\nFrom what I see, he is a grown adult and these kids are his responsibility. I made a choice to live the way I do and I do not want to sacrifice my life for his choices. \n\nMy family is pressuring me onto this saying stuff like how my brother does not know how to take care of kids, the little girls need a women in their life, how family helps family etc.\n\nMy brother is calling me cold hearted for not even trying to help him. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695300022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oew5g/aita_for_not_helping_my_brother_with_his/", "score": 182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are innocent in all of this and their mom literally just vanished on them and their dad is useless. I can't imagine what they are going through. I don't know how your relationship with them is, but you are being a little selfish by refusing to do anything for a couple of kids who are well within your sphere of influence.\n\nI wouldn't offer much more than babysitting on occasion as the dad needs to be forced to step up, but doing nothing is pretty heartless.", "What about a nanny or enrolling them in daycare ? Even thou mom left she is still financially responsible for them (50%) He needs to get a lawyer and start working on things and get daycare for his kids! If he needs help at night hire a Pt nanny till he gets it right!", "So while thinking it was a short term help,  mom did not teach your brother anything? He had plenty of time to learn the ropes, even after his wife left. \n\nNo it's not your job,  NTA\n\nMaybe agree to help him for one day, and then when you are there for every single mini step you ask him \"how?\" \"What now?\" Then you get to say.. \"see I don't know either, sorry I can't help\" and when he says \"but you can learn\" the correct response is \"so do you!'\n\nNo you don't really have to go there, this conversation can also be held without proving the point first, but it would probably piss him off if you interrupted him like every 5 seconds so he doesn't get anything done either xD", "This whole situation. Just because you have a vagina, it becomes your obligation? Or some ingrained natural, flowing ability that will just rush into you? How ridiculous. Your brother is the parent. Why does his penis instantly make him excusable for being inept? What an absolute joke. The man doesnt even WANT his own kids, and still gets no judgement? Because he is a man!?!

NTA", "NTA-  your brothers penis does not make him less qualified to raise his children than you.\n\nWtf is wrong with your family? You are not moving in to raise your brothers kids because that's not a resonable expectation- should they mention this insane idea  again tell them they can an rase the kids if they think your brother is incapable, but you consider him a competent adult capable of hiring a nanny if he can't care for his own children.", "NTA. He did that to himself.", "Nra", "I'm sorry but your not there to tell him how to run his household. I would tell him that. Nta but your brother sure is tell him it's time he Steped up and realised what it took to be a parent.", "NTA.

He\u2019s their *father.* Now he just needs to step up and be a parent. Boobs don\u2019t make you better with children, frankly all mine do is ruin the line of a nice sweater. And that\u2019s the literal only reason he wants you to step up - because you\u2019re a woman and he\u2019s a misogynist.", "If he was asking for something reasonable- a week of short-term help while he got childcare plans in place, regular babysitting, picking the kids up on your way back from work because it fits with your schedule- I'd say you had to step up and help out.\n\nBut the fact that he's escalating directly to you TAKING IN HIS CHILDREN. Lol. No. You need to draw a hard line. This is absurd. He's a dad and needs to act like it.

While I do enjoy spending time with my neices and nephews and will watch them once and a while for my younger sister.\n But  I'm not a parent and never wanted to be one. \nIn a dire situation, I'd take them in without question.

He needs to get over himself, take some parenting classes, or hire a nanny.", "NTA. I feel bad for the kids but not in the sense that you or your parents are at fault. I feel bad that their dad is so useless.

That she vanished, and not even her family knows where she is, is suspicious.", "NTA. Your brother has some growing up to do, and fast.

Within days he was calling her multiple times a day asking how to make different types of food, how to get different types of surfaces clean, how to not ruin laundry, etc. Working parents with a stay at home spouse never seem to realize how much that SAHS does until they're gone.", "I feel really sad for the kids, but it does sound like your brother brought it all on himself, and is now trying to dump his kids (and the responsibility) on somebody else.\n\nHe'll have to work out a way to deal with the situation without family help, though.  Your parents are obviously worried about the grandchildren, but they are wrong in guilt-tripping you for doing something you don't want to do.\n\nPlus, you are in a trauma yourself, not wanting durable relationships because of the way your family functioned (or disfunctioned), so you're not the best choice for those little girls either. \n\nTell your brother to find a good nanny for his daughters and ask your parents to stop badgering you about it, or they are welcome to take the girls themselves.\n\nNTA.", "NTA for not wanting to move in or have the kids move in with you. He needs to get his shit together ASAP and stop trying to pawn two confused and probably scared little girls off on unwilling family members.\n\nBut I seriously hope that he/her family/someone has reported her missing to the police.

But brother doesn\u2019t seem to understand that it\u2019s not your obligation so it probably would go unnoticed.", "NTA. It's his own fault he's a terrible father and seemingly a terrible sexist jerk who expects women to  serve him at his whim. He made his own decisions and he will face the consequences of those decisions. Do not help him. He did this to himself", "My dad is like him. My mom was SAHM and catered to them both. She taught only me to cook, clean, do laundry and serve. One of the main reasons I stay away from relationships.", "He just needs to find another \"wife\" quickly \ud83d\ude02.

How does a person do that?\n\nAnd I'd be willing to bet the dad has told the girls that they were going to stay with Grandma and Grandpa before they said no. Then probably told the girls that their aunt was going to stay, too. And I bet he's framing it to the kids as Grandma/Grandpa don't want you, your aunt doesn't want you, etc.\n\nThese kids, from their perspective, are being abandoned and rejected by every adult in their lives right now. I feel so incredibly sad for them.
