I date occasionally but no long term relationships. This is due to many reasons like I love my freedom, I want to enjoy my life unencumbered with responsibilities and want to really focus on my career. \n\nMy older brother (M34) got married when he was 26. He has two kids (F7, F4). They had a traditional household. He wanted a partner who stayed home and looked after the family while he earned. She had apparently dreamed of being a homemaker and taking care of children. \n\nBut during last couple of years she showed signs of hating it. She wanted to study more and work outside. Build something of her own. But my brother refused to step up or help. I warned him once but he told me it's none of my business how he runs his household. I kept my mouth shut since. \n\nHis wife left him a month ago. She just wrote him a letter saying she can't do this and want to explore her life. She left kids with him and basically vanished. We have no idea where she is.\n\nThing is my brother doesn't know how to do even the most basic things. He is the kind of guy who never changed a diaper or toasted bread. The moment my brother found that his wife left, he called my mother who rushed in to save the day.  She thought it was short term and my SIL would be back, but she hasn't. My father is unwell and needs her home soon. They live hours away. \n\nMy brother suggested she take kids home with her. My dad said no. He is retired and they are both getting old. He does not want to have kids in the house full time, taking up her time and energy. \n\nSince that was a no go, my brother asked me to either move in with them to help out or take kids in with me. I refused.\n\nFrom what I see, he is a grown adult and these kids are his responsibility. I made a choice to live the way I do and I do not want to sacrifice my life for his choices. \n\nMy family is pressuring me onto this saying stuff like how my brother does not know how to take care of kids, the little girls need a women in their life, how family helps family etc.\n\nMy brother is calling me cold hearted for not even trying to help him. \n\nAITA?\n\nIs she okay: In the post I had given no one knew where she is based on info I was given by my mother. She told me they had communicated with SILs parents as well. \n\nHearing that she had taken all her documents and per her note, I trusted she had gone somewhere where she can study and make something of herself. \n\nBut a lot of comments had me questioning about it all. Many of you wanted me to file report as missing person. What I realised is, me and my parents not filing it made sense. We know and trust my brother. But why didn't my SIL's parents file a report? They should have been more suspicious, right?\n\nSo I called SIL's mom. She didn't sound worried or sad, so I was more suspicious. I asked if she knew where SIL is. She said they don't know, SIL did not say anything to them etc. I told her I would be filing report today then, so we know she is safe. \n\nHer mom panicked at that and told me not to. That SIL will come home when she is ready. I told her I have to file report unless I know she is safe. She kept insisting I don't have to. It was very suspicious. \n\n5 mins after my call, I got a call from an unknown number. It was SIL. She was panicking and more or less begged me not to file a report. Turns out she was in another state, crashing with distant family.  She really did want to go to college and my brother was not letting her. She had a huge fight with him about all that the week before she left. She was really depressed and feeling stuck. Her parents loaned her some cash through a church friend who also helped her go away. \n\nShe begged me not to file report saying he will sue her for child support and she can barely support herself and go to college. \n\nI told her abandoning her kids was wrong. She was crying when she said she know and hope they can forgive her. She really couldn't live this life anymore. Leaving them was the hardest decision she ever made but she felt it was better than taking them and letting them starve with her. Atleast here they have home and family. \n\nI did ask why she couldn't just divorce my brother then. She said she did not have money for lawyer or anything. No home to return to. She is not proud of it but she just couldn't stay and fight.\n\nShe didnot tell me where exactly she is. Didnot want to risk it. Asked me not to give her number to my family.\n\nI did tell her situation with her kids. She just said my brother will figure it out. She cannot help in any way right now. She will come back to her babies when she can.", "created_utc": 1695300022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oew5g/aita_for_not_helping_my_brother_with_his/", "score": 5251, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All they're seeing is every adult in their life choose to abandon or distance themselves from the kids. How must that feel for them? These kids are going to grow up with serious abandonment issues.

Perhaps a threat to OUT them as child abusers will have a positive affect.  Maybe THAT will whip them both into shape to do what is right by their children. Their other choice is give them up for adoption and severe their parental rights.  Which would leave huge scars for those babies. The decision for any family to step in and raise those kids so the parents don't have to is a HUGE one.. but I see it as necessary- and I would force the parents to give up any rights to the children if I did that.

Certainly be open to alternatives such as domestic violence if more evidence comes to light, but right now it's not really clear why she left.\n\nThe mother of those children has an obligation to help support her kids.  Maybe she doesn't want to get a job and pay child support but she needs to.  If it was a father who ran off you'd call him a deadbeat.  She needs to step up in some form.  There's nothing preventing her from finding a job and mailing a check.\n\nThink about what you can do that helps the situation without signing you up to be a parent.  Maybe you can help your brother apply for food stamps and subsidized day care.  Maybe you can facilitate SIL returning to the general area so that she can share parenting time or  help her fill out divorce paperwork.  Perhaps just taking the kids out for an afternoon once a week is what you are willing to do.  Keep it limited to things that are an acceptable amount of involvement for you personally so you don't become resentful.\n\nYour brother needs to file for a separation (basically a divorce) and get a child custody order, parenting time schedule and child support order.

It sounds likely he was financially and emotionally abusive, and possibly physically abusive.  The way her friend and family helped her leave suddenly and are helping her hide is not normal for someone who simply wants a different life.  For that reason, it's important that somebody is checking on the kids and that the kids have a way to reach out to you, your parents, and their other grandparents if they need help.  The oldest needs a phone that their dad doesn't control.  And maybe alert their school counselor and ask that the staff keep a closer eye on the kids and let you know if they suspect a problem.

It's quite common for the wife to have no resources.  Their fees get paid by the spouse with income.   And in fact, your SIL may be eligible to get alimony from your brother to help cover her expenses while she goes back to school so that she can get the credentials for a good job.  It may also be possible to arrange visitation or at least video calls so she can stay in contact with her kids and not completely lose that relationship.\n\nAt a minimum, she should call a few lawyers in the area where your brother lives and get a brief consultation.

I really, really think you need to file a police report. Best case she is fine and going to school somewhere (which would be almost impossible without money and loans would possibly get denied if she is married as he would be involved). Worst case, your brother did something incredibly horrible and everyone needs to know.", "OP, this whole situation is VERY concerning. Please ignore your brother and make the report, but do NOT give your brother any information or anyone that would give him info if you find anything out yourself.", "I read your comments and update and honestly your brother sounds pretty problematic. He basically isolated his wife and kept her completely dependant on him. I do think her abandoning the kids was wrong but I get it. She was probably afraid of your brother and knew he'd never let her leave. \n\nAnd the fact that he still hasn't learned his lesson and accepted that she's left and expects all of you to parent his children shows that maybe she was right to leave him.", "Sounds like he treated her like crap, no wonder why she ran off.  He's an AH all the way through", "\u201cAsking\u201d is obvious. But guilting, negging, removing necesites until an action stops , etc, etc\u2026\n\nThere are multiple ways to isolate someone.", "Fire a missing person report. You think you know what goes on in your brother's home, but you absolutely don't.", "Something bad may have happened to her. She was a sahm and her phone has been disconnected. That is suspicious for her to disappear as she has no funds to do so and didn't go to family. \n\nThe report needs filed and tbh those girls need checked on regularly. No one knows what goes on behind closed doors.", "It kinda makes me suspicious as to why OP\u2019s brother doesn\u2019t want to file a missing Person report.\n\nI wonder what she has on him or what is he afraid of everyone finding out if he does file.  \n\nI would file just to make sure she\u2019s okay and make sure OP\u2019s abusive brother didn\u2019t do anything to her. \n\nHe seems to be like the type to physically restrain a woman trying to leave him\u2026\u2026", "I hope you\u2019re not planning on telling your brother you talked to her. \n\nLet her make something of herself so she can come back to her children with the proper footing to face your brother.\n\nYou should be fully on her side. Your brother is an abusive man OP.", "Agree. His children, his responsibility. And like another comment mentioned, YouTube is an excellent resource. That's how I learned how to do most of my cooking, cleaning and home repairs lol! It's amazing how much you can learn in just a 10-minute video. Point is, he has options.\n\n\\*Corrected a typo", "Pretty sure most women in their twenties aren't looking for a man approaching middle age with a couple of full-time kids.", "I would if it were my daughter being abused. There aren\u2019t a lot of options for women who aren\u2019t poor; the book *Not to People Like Us: Hidden Abuse in Upscale Marriages* makes it clear how hard it is for stay at home moms to get out of that trap. You need time to come up with a plan, and people with resources will weaponize the legal system where they can.", "I think he's more in denial than anything. Filing report means his left did actually leave him and the new world of taking over the kids is real and likely long term.", "Any domestic violence agency receiving federal funds cannot confirm or deny the presence of a specific person without that person's consent. It's part of the confidentiality rules in VAWA, VOCA, and FVSPA funding. Many states also impose similar and additional rules. Cops don't have confidentiality, and most of the time, they don't want to be put in a position where they may have to reveal a victim's location. \n\nhttps://www.confidentialityinstitute.org/learn-about-confidentiality", "My uncle had plenty of money and made sure that my aunt had none of it to run the household with.  She literally had to beg him to add her as an authorized user on one of his credit cards just so she could go grocery shopping.  \n\nI'll never forget when she told my mom and I about one of the times where she needed to buy food.  She was extremely nervous because every single time he had an issue with her wanting to do anything to manage the household.  This time, he took a couple of dollars out of his wallet, tossed it across the counter to her, and walked out the door.  \n\nMy aunt tearfully counted $4.00 and called her mom, who lived in the next state, that she was sitting in this huge house and just had money thrown at her like she was a homeless person.  Her mom drove down and bought the groceries for her.  The disdain my uncle had for his wife, the mother of his son, was so disgusting.  However, he was the one who, just like OP's brother, wanted a woman who stayed at home while he was the breadwinner.", "Many women hide small amounts of cash for years and years and years. This is why i tell ALL my mentees to do \u201cyours, mine, ours\u201d and if he balks don\u2019t marry him.", "Def agree that a report needs to be filed regardless of his feelings. If its nothing nefarious from him. She could be having a mental health crisis or maybe she's a secret drug addict and going on a bender. IDK Regardless she needs to found for her safety and for the children", "I am not going to tell him.\n\nIn addition to everything you said, if he wanted to find her he could have filed a report or tried in someway. I don't think he is going to ask me and I am not voluntarily giving him info.", "But he's a MAN! Why are you expecting HIM to clean or cook, when he has a sister who could do it all for him? \n\n/heavy S, in case it was not clear.", "That's why he'll target 19-23 when they're so young they're too inexperienced to know better. A good chunk of time love bombing them and when they move in they'll become stuck like brother's wife was.", "Read reddit long enough and the song, \"there is a sucker born every minute,\" sings non stop in your head. \n\nHe will definitely get a bang maid.", "I mean, continuing to commit that this story is real aside, it seems like it's been a while. It's not like it's been like a week so OP hasn't mentioned her brother filing. It's been a month with mom helping and then stopping helping, I think we're a little beyond denial now.", "Yes! My husband and I share finances but also have separate accounts, not because we fear a scenario where one of us needs to get out but because I want to spend $300 at Sephora and he wants a new phone and not have it mess with our bills budget. We can save and spend our own money on those things and pay rent/utilities/food out of our combined. \n\nHopefully she did squirrel away small cash if that\u2019s the case.", "And for free, since was a woman, she obviously doesn\u2019t need a salary or benefits /s"]}
