I date occasionally but no long term relationships. This is due to many reasons like I love my freedom, I want to enjoy my life unencumbered with responsibilities and want to really focus on my career. \n\nMy older brother (M34) got married when he was 26. He has two kids (F7, F4). They had a traditional household. He wanted a partner who stayed home and looked after the family while he earned. She had apparently dreamed of being a homemaker and taking care of children. \n\nBut during last couple of years she showed signs of hating it. She wanted to study more and work outside. Build something of her own. But my brother refused to step up or help. I warned him once but he told me it's none of my business how he runs his household. I kept my mouth shut since. \n\nHis wife left him a month ago. She just wrote him a letter saying she can't do this and want to explore her life. She left kids with him and basically vanished. We have no idea where she is.\n\nThing is my brother doesn't know how to do even the most basic things. He is the kind of guy who never changed a diaper or toasted bread. The moment my brother found that his wife left, he called my mother who rushed in to save the day.  She thought it was short term and my SIL would be back, but she hasn't. My father is unwell and needs her home soon. They live hours away. \n\nMy brother suggested she take kids home with her. My dad said no. He is retired and they are both getting old. He does not want to have kids in the house full time, taking up her time and energy. \n\nSince that was a no go, my brother asked me to either move in with them to help out or take kids in with me. I refused.\n\nFrom what I see, he is a grown adult and these kids are his responsibility. I made a choice to live the way I do and I do not want to sacrifice my life for his choices. \n\nMy family is pressuring me onto this saying stuff like how my brother does not know how to take care of kids, the little girls need a women in their life, how family helps family etc.\n\nMy brother is calling me cold hearted for not even trying to help him. \n\nAITA?\n\nIs she okay: In the post I had given no one knew where she is based on info I was given by my mother. She told me they had communicated with SILs parents as well. \n\nHearing that she had taken all her documents and per her note, I trusted she had gone somewhere where she can study and make something of herself. \n\nBut a lot of comments had me questioning about it all. Many of you wanted me to file report as missing person. What I realised is, me and my parents not filing it made sense. We know and trust my brother. But why didn't my SIL's parents file a report? They should have been more suspicious, right?\n\nSo I called SIL's mom. She didn't sound worried or sad, so I was more suspicious. I asked if she knew where SIL is. She said they don't know, SIL did not say anything to them etc. I told her I would be filing report today then, so we know she is safe. \n\nHer mom panicked at that and told me not to. That SIL will come home when she is ready. I told her I have to file report unless I know she is safe. She kept insisting I don't have to. It was very suspicious. \n\n5 mins after my call, I got a call from an unknown number. It was SIL. She was panicking and more or less begged me not to file a report. Turns out she was in another state, crashing with distant family.  She really did want to go to college and my brother was not letting her. She had a huge fight with him about all that the week before she left. She was really depressed and feeling stuck. Her parents loaned her some cash through a church friend who also helped her go away. \n\nShe begged me not to file report saying he will sue her for child support and she can barely support herself and go to college. \n\nI told her abandoning her kids was wrong. She was crying when she said she know and hope they can forgive her. She really couldn't live this life anymore. Leaving them was the hardest decision she ever made but she felt it was better than taking them and letting them starve with her. Atleast here they have home and family. \n\nI did ask why she couldn't just divorce my brother then. She said she did not have money for lawyer or anything. No home to return to. She is not proud of it but she just couldn't stay and fight.\n\nShe didnot tell me where exactly she is. Didnot want to risk it. Asked me not to give her number to my family.\n\nI did tell her situation with her kids. She just said my brother will figure it out. She cannot help in any way right now. She will come back to her babies when she can.", "created_utc": 1695300022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oew5g/aita_for_not_helping_my_brother_with_his/", "score": 8705, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's asking you to give him your entire life to take over his responsibilities for him.**  \n\nHelping would be coming over for a couple of hours and teaching him how to do laundry and basic cooking, showing him where to look online to learn more about basic cleaning chores, or where to research about hiring help. \n\nHe doesn't want just help.

They're young and don't understand the dynamics here. I can't expect a 7 year old and a 4 year old to fully grasp all this. All they're seeing is every adult in their life choose to abandon or distance themselves from the kids. How must that feel for them? These kids are going to grow up with serious abandonment issues.

While I concede its not your legal responsibility to raise these kids, it IS your legal responsibility to report crimes of abandonment and neglect.

If I was in your shoes, I would warn each parent that they will be reported to authorities ( Child protective services, and any other entity that could have influence on them to to do the right thing: example, friends, coworkers, teachers, etc..). Perhaps a threat to OUT them as child abusers will have a positive affect.  Maybe THAT will whip them both into shape to do what is right by their children. Their other choice is give them up for adoption and severe their parental rights.  Which would leave huge scars for those babies. The decision for any family to step in and raise those kids so the parents don't have to is a HUGE one.. but I see it as necessary- and I would force the parents to give up any rights to the children if I did that.

His wife's lack of spending money and his lack of support for college is certainly a red flag but it may have been due to a poor financial situation.  Certainly be open to alternatives such as domestic violence if more evidence comes to light, but right now it's not really clear why she left.\n\nThe mother of those children has an obligation to help support her kids.  Maybe she doesn't want to get a job and pay child support but she needs to.  If it was a father who ran off you'd call him a deadbeat.  She needs to step up in some form.  There's nothing preventing her from finding a job and mailing a check.\n\nThink about what you can do that helps the situation without signing you up to be a parent.  Maybe you can help your brother apply for food stamps and subsidized day care.  Maybe you can facilitate SIL returning to the general area so that she can share parenting time or  help her fill out divorce paperwork.  Perhaps just taking the kids out for an afternoon once a week is what you are willing to do.  Keep it limited to things that are an acceptable amount of involvement for you personally so you don't become resentful.\n\nYour brother needs to file for a separation (basically a divorce) and get a child custody order, parenting time schedule and child support order.

It sounds likely he was financially and emotionally abusive, and possibly physically abusive.  The way her friend and family helped her leave suddenly and are helping her hide is not normal for someone who simply wants a different life.  For that reason, it's important that somebody is checking on the kids and that the kids have a way to reach out to you, your parents, and their other grandparents if they need help.  The oldest needs a phone that their dad doesn't control.  And maybe alert their school counselor and ask that the staff keep a closer eye on the kids and let you know if they suspect a problem.

It's quite common for the wife to have no resources.  Their fees get paid by the spouse with income.   And in fact, your SIL may be eligible to get alimony from your brother to help cover her expenses while she goes back to school so that she can get the credentials for a good job.  It may also be possible to arrange visitation or at least video calls so she can stay in contact with her kids and not completely lose that relationship.\n\nAt a minimum, she should call a few lawyers in the area where your brother lives and get a brief consultation.

What she doesn\u2019t realize is that he can divorce her anyway - and she\u2019s going to be a lot worse off because of her abandonment.", "And the kids are 7 and 4 which means one is in school and the other is almost there. So SIL was within a year of having time to do her own thing. The fact she bailed tells me he wasn't going to allow her to do anything OTHER than take care of kids and home.", "Considering the statistics on domestic abuse in cop families, I very much hope the shelters do not talk to cops, actually.", "That's exactly where my mind went too.  OP is NTA.  And he'll find a new, younger, dumber model to be Mrs. SAHM #2 before you know it.  In the meantime, he can get off his ass and learn to cook and clean for HIS CHILDREN.", "Statistically speaking, younger women from abusive/underprivileged homes are easily manipulated by older men who offer financial stability, and the image of a happy family home.\n\nAs someone who volunteers at women shelters, and especially battered women shelters, I can see it happening. All he has to do is turn on the charm, love bomb her, and present himself as the loving but struggling single father, who has been abandoned by his hold-digging ex-wife, and he will have a young, vulnerable woman hooked.", "I think it goes beyond pontificating over college. It sounds like a mental health crisis involving coercive control (from her husband) and possibly regrets at what she has lost by having kids. Many young mothers don't fully grasp that once you have kids there is no handing them back and it causes some of them to spiral when the going gets tough. I actually feel a lot of compassion for her. It sounds like she needs much more support and a break. This is obviously not the way to go about it as the biggest casualties are the kids. The dad is a massive, chauvinistic a-hole which he obviously gets from his dad, the mum needs support with the kids and her overall well-being. She also needs to find a way of fulfilling herself, whether that's going to college, getting a job or both. But the first thing is getting her mental and emotional well-being back on track. The dad needs to step up. The kids are going to need a massive amount of therapy one way or another. Without it they will have attachment issues for life.", "Bingo. This. It definitely wasn\u2019t the first argument about it. SIL realized she was going to be trapped and lose all her freedom. Or what little she had left. It\u2019s not a decision made casually. She knew it was get out now or never get out at all.", "You should try and talk to him about the problems they were having and get him to see reason as to why she left him the way she did. \n\nAsk him if he\u2019s happy with the way things have turned out due to his refusal to hear his wife out.\n\nAsk him if he\u2019s even willing to compromise on his wife\u2019s needs if she\u2019s willing to come back and raise the kids together.\n\nYour nieces are hurting and your brother is the cause of all this if he would just listen to what his wife wants .", "See an actual \"breadwinner\" would give his family bread.", "My grandparents were like that too. When she was getting older, and having a lot more trouble, she begged him to get her a dishwasher. This would have been in the '80s, so not exactly when they were unattainable. He absolutely refused for years.\n\n Eventually, one of her sons bought a dishwasher and installed it for her himself and yelled at his dad. The other two would have never helped her. \n\nHe was my favorite uncle.", "A SINGLE sister.  Obviously she isn't doing anything important with her life, since she doesn't have a husband and children.  /s\n\nSeriously, how can anyone think that a childfree person would make a superior caregiver than someone who has actually been a parent for the past seven years?  I think asking OP to help out now and then, like babysitting when he is out for a few hours, is fine - lots of single parents get help from family, but he suggested his children move in with her?!? simply because she has a uterus?", "I was ranting to a friend a few days ago about this. I'm also CF and single and made very deliberate choices about not having kids. But the second anything goes wrong in the life of family or friends with children, I'm suddenly expected to rush into the void because I'm a childfree woman who obviously has nothing better to do \"insert eyeroll here\"  \n\n\nWrong. Those kids were not my choice, so they're not my responsibility. And this goes double when there's an available man around  - their father no less - who pleads weaponized incompetence and refuses to lift a finger, I'll give you a size 9 to the backside, but that's about all the assistance you'll get out of me. If I can use YouTube to fix a lawnmower, then you can use it to learn how to cook and change a diaper. Step up to the job you signed up for. Anyone who chooses to be a parent should expect that for any reason, they may become a singe parent, and plan accordingly.", "Respectfully, I have additional questions about the state of your brother's home. From the story the SIL gave, it almost sounds like the Brother's home went from patriarchal to abusive-  the SIL told. the Brother she wanted to go to school and he didn't \"let\" her?  \n\nThere is clearly more going on in that house that the Brother has told. He created an enviroment where he was in control of the women-  and now the women (both the SIL and the OP) aren't obeying what he wants.", "Based on the update, SIL sounds like an abuse victim who went to extreme measures to gwt out, which makes me suspect there is much more to this story. At a bare minimum, there is clearly financial abuse (SAHM with no access to family money, borrowed cash through church contacts, staying out of state with distant family...)", "First off nta. \n\nSecond from your update. Women, especially mothers, don\u2019t just flee secretly to another state unless there\u2019s a reason. Id be real concerned over abuse from your brother. His insistence she cannot go to school is another massive red flag over this", "NTA\n\nYour brother decided to have kids and alienate his wife.  This is all on him.", "Everyone here please read up on financial abuse and coercive control in relationships- her brother is ticking off all the \ud83d\udea9 for that. I believe she\u2019s in danger and working behind scenes to get kids a safe way from facts given and her brother is scary.", "NTA your brother sounds like a controlling, abusive, toxic husband. Your SIL didn't leave your brother, she escaped from your brother!", "OP, you should help... your SIL. \n\nPoint her towards resources that help women flee abusive situations so she can get her education, a job and her kids. And maybe child support and even alimony. \n\nNo one deserves a dumpster fire like your brother and I hope those kids turn out alright despite him.", "This isn't any of your business. Your brother is a misogynist who ran his wife off by refusing to allow her to evolve or grow. So he has now evolved into being a single father, while she tries to make a life for herself. If he wanted to, he'd learn how to tend to his kids, instead of assuming your ovaries give you special momming abilities. Since he has no desire to do so and the mother has abandoned them to make her escape, the girls could be better off being adopted by parents who actually want to raise them. Your brother won't treat them well. They're just girls and have no value to him. And your parents are 0ast the child rearing age. \n\nBut none of this is your issue to fix or manage. You have no legal rights here and cannot make any decisions, beyond the choice not to take the girls in. Your brother is used to having a woman clean up his mess. Perhaps the next woman in his life will be a social worker, who can actually make a difference for his daughters.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. But your brother is a huge a*hole. He decided to have children, didn't lift a finger to care for them or raise them, doesn't do anything around the house, didn't allow his wife to go to college ... \n\nStand your ground. The second you give an and give a finger he will take all of you and won't let you out. F*ck His \"Family helps each other\" - his wife and kids are his family and he NEVER helpes them. He doesn't care about \"family\", none of you. He wanted to get rid of his kids immediately and I feel bad for them because nobody wants them. \nYour parents suck too.", "NTA for not doing his job but you will be the asshole if you bother SIL anymore. Your brother is abusive. Don\u2019t say anything about where she is and do not contact her again.", "NTA. He chose to have children, and he chose not to learn how to care for them. Now he has no choice so he\u2019ll have to do it.\n\nCan\u2019t say I\u2019m shocked that his wife left him if he\u2019s like this. Poor woman must have been miserable and desperate. I hope the kids are okay but this isn\u2019t your responsibility at all.", "This really really sucks. You are NTA, but I feel for the kids. Their father doesn\u2019t want them or know how to take care of the. Their mother was felt so trapped and unhappy that she figures leaving her kids behind would be better than any alternative.  \n\nIt is not your responsibility to take care of the kids, but please show them some love during this time they are probably feeling very abandoned and unloved.", "NTA but I feel for SIL, your brother sounds controlling and like he was abusing her. People don't just run away from home like that... probably the wisest decision was not to move in, he'd probably start abusing and controlling you too. He's a grown adult who helped bring these children into the world, it's time for him to get his head put of the 1800s and be a parent or put them up for adoption so they can go to competent parents who actually want them.", "NTA. Your brother is abusive. I can't imagine what his wife must have gone through to end up leaving her kids behind.\n\nThat he has two kids and doesn't know how to do the basic stuff. That's absolutely insane.\n\nBe ready to call CPS though and keep an eye on the kids because it's a recipe for disaster.", "NTA- but I really hope she can get her babies back at some point and get child support out of him.  This breaks my heart.", "Lol it's clear the mother fled from a dv perp", "It really looks like your brother was/is abusing his wife. I don't think you're the AH. If given the chance your brother will make you stop your work and become his live in maid. \n\nNTA but SIL needs help. And your brother is the biggest AH, on top of all that is happening he is trying to get rid of the kids giving them to the first person that would take them.", "Leave the SIL where she is Op. Do not reveal her location. Your brother is a chauvinist and you are his enabler by revealing her location. Get your head out of the sand and back her up with your brother. You sound as emotionally stunted as him.", "NTA but maybe stay out of her business while she takes some space to figure out how to deal with your AH brother.", "Damn, after that edit- that\u2019s freaking crazy. NTA but both of them (your brother and SIL) kinda suck. Your brother for not letting your SIL study and your SIL for abandoning her kids. I understand that she had to leave an abusive relationship, but it\u2019s really rubbing me the wrong way that she said to not file a missing persons report because she can\u2019t pay child support. Why can\u2019t her parents take the kids? Why doesn\u2019t she look for a pro bono lawyer and talk about the financial abuse? Any of the abuse that matter. Her kids are being left with an idiot.", "NTA but you and the kids are the only ones\n\n- Abandoning kids is wrong, just wrong and specially if the father is that controlling. I'm sorry but I don't feel bad for the adult with a good support system.\n\n- Your brother is an A for obvious reasons", "NTA, but FYI your SIL left because your brother is an abuser. Isolated from friends? Had to quit her job and has no access to money? Controlled every aspect of her life (college etc)? The fact that she needed a village to escape? These are all signs of domestic abuse. \n\nDefinitely don\u2019t move in or \u201chelp\u201d your brother, he needs to learn how to be an adult and take care of himself. But keep a watchful eye over those kids. I\u2019m concerned for them.", "3. Talk your mom into helping take care of the problem she created. \n\nPS - You're NTA", "How does he think his wife learned how to do it? Doing laundry is not a trait that is passed on genetically?", "> It's kind of a shame that his wife couldn't sit him down and make him realize; this changes, or I'm leaving.\n\nshe might have had this conversation with him hundreds of times, we have no idea. i highly doubt abandoning her children was her first step.", "I'm reading the edits and it legit sounds like an abuse victim fleeing. The fear and flight and even leaving the kids behind. I'm low key terrified for those kids.", "She absolutely has MH going on. Living in an environment like that breaks a person.", "I mean, just to be petty I\u2019d probably send him a \u201ccare package\u201d of books on parenting, \u201ccleaning for dummies\u201d (is there such a thing?), and anything else on the topic, with a note saying \u201cI heard you needed help, so I put this together for you!\u201d There, I helped by finding the information, now he can put it to use.", ">just abandoned them. How does a person do that?\n\nDesperation and stress ... like a fox chewing its leg off to escape a trap.", "I'm wondering if there's DV here.", "She had to have a church member help her disappear and had to take all her documents with her I'm betting she was afraid he was going to destroy them and he's probably been abusive in some way to her other than just controlling her ability to go to school", "Cavemen figured out how to raise kids. Its boring and never ending but it isn't complicated.", "Heck, some stuff has directions on the package too!", "Did you see the update yet? It's pretty depressing honestly and he is such an abusive AH.", "Sadly true. Unless he has a huge mental awakening, he will probably still see himself as the victim of his \"shameless\" wife who ran off for no reason. He is eager to dump his responsibilities for his children on the first woman he finds.", "Most likely, she would have preferred to take the kids, but barely had the resources to get herself out alone. \n\nMany shelters won't take in minors, the liability is too high.  (This is a real problem for older teens who are still minors trying to escape abusive parents.)  If she gets an apartment, she's going to need a bigger, more expensive one with children. \n\nIt will take time in her new location to set things up to be appropriate for children. \n\nIf she disappears on her own, she's an adult, there will be few complications.  If she disappears with the kids, their father could report them as having been kidnapped, and use that to force her to return.", "Financial and psychological harm can be plenty damaging all on their own.", "That's what I read too, and the update in the post doesn't change my opinion.  \n\nThat woman sounds exhausted. During the deepest part of my own depression, getting out of bed to feed myself was insurmountable. If I managed that once every 2 days, I was having a good week, even though it was stale bread or unheated lasagna.  \n\nI get that OP can't be her sister-in-law's therapist, but it all feels awful.  \nAnd poor OP has to live with the knowledge that it's her brother doing this, following her father's example with her mother's tacit approval.", "Some other commenters also pointed it out, thank you!  \n\nAgreed it's very depressing. I feel OP was fairly harsh with the blackmailing etc. but I guess I don't have any realistic suggestions on how to deal with something like that, esp knowing it's your brother and your father creating this chaos, with your mother's tacit support...", "Nah he\u2019ll parentify the oldest kid asap.", "Seeing as how she abandoned those kids, with the support and approval of her own parents, I don't think she wanted to be a wife and mother. Unfortunately her kids will pay the price of that realization.", "So will she. She\u2019s probably planning to take student loans, which will count as income when determining child support. In some States she can be arrested for non-payment. \n\nAnd she will have this against her - he doesn\u2019t need to know where she is to file for divorce, especially since she was foolish enough to leave a note admitting that she was leaving willingly and further admitted to OP that she did it in the way she did to avoid paying child support. \n\nShe picked the absolute WORST option she could have. She should have taken her parents\u2019 loan and hired an attorney for a divorce. Instead she\u2019s going to get nothing. Possibly not even visitation rights for her kids. And judges get NASTY when a parent abandons their kids and admits to wanting to avoid CS. Especially, right or wrong, when it\u2019s the mom. There\u2019s a good chance she\u2019ll have to pay enough to ensure she will be bankrupt until the kids are 18, especially once loan payments are accounted for.\n\nDid she not understand that she was going to ensure she got nothing from her marriage if she did this? If you want to destroy your life, abandon your children while married. Seriously, College is not worth this. Why didn\u2019t she use the loan to divorce?!?! Her of actually succeeding and getting what she wanted would be much higher!", "That's horrific. How do these shitheads find wives? This is why I think women should always have a job that pays real money. I'm sure he was really nice to her and made her feel at ease with being a housewife, buttering her up before turning up the control dial. No woman would accept this nightmare future if their husbands told them how they were actually planning to treat them"]}
