Bobby would join another class for the day and do work inside while his classmates were at the barbecue. \n\nShe has been sending emails complaining to myself and the principal all week about how her child should also be able to participate and it is unfair.

These are 1st graders.  From what you've posted,  it sounds like this was the only student excluded. There is literally no way that is going to encourage better behavior from this young child in the future. \n\nKids, especially young ones,  often act out in reaction to emotional stimuli they don't have the appropriate tools to process yet.  99% of the time,  a kid of 1st grade age who is acting out has trouble somewhere - stress/problems at home,  getting bullied, who knows.  For the same reason it's unfair to punish young kids for tardiness or attendance issues,  it's unfair to expect a kid this young to \"behave\" all the time when you have no idea what might be happening in their lives that isn't in their control. \n\nPublicly excluding one child is going to make behavior issues worse.  You're turning them into a pariah to their peers - kids can be mean,  and honestly don't need much to single someone out as \"other.\" \n\nI know you want to use some kind of reward system for the kids who are behaving the way you want,  but you're talking about 6 year olds! Something as big as a BBQ at the park should have been an all-or-nothing class goal. Singling out the one kid who is having trouble (which, again, you as the teacher will almost NEVER know the true source of) is bullying. \n\nIf these were high schoolers that would be one thing - teenagers are more mature and can be expected to have more control over their behavior - but we're talking about kids who are only SIX years old. \n\nYou need to rethink your reward system,  keeping in mind age-appropriate expectations for these children.\n\nEdit: some of your comments specify that this kid has an IEP. 100% YTA. A kid that young who already has an IEP is never going to be able to meet that level of behavioral expectation, regardless of whatever accommodations the IEP calls for. Perfection for a month! You set this kid up to fail. Hopefully not on purpose,  but that's still the outcome. Learn from this in the future.", "Expecting first graders to be good all month is already hard enough as is, but excluding some of the kids while the rest have fun? Yeah, this wouldn't be okay with me if I was a parent. \n\nI wouldn't have my child go to school on that day. \n\nYTA", "YTA its kinda shitty to do that with a first grader", "YTA\n\nSingling out a child who you know have behavioural issues and possibly can\u2019t control certain things and you\u2019re punishing them for it?\n\nI\u2019m glad our teachers recognise effort, we all have shit days and this is one of your massive ones! Glad you don\u2019t teach my kids!", "YTA. *Perfect* behavior for an entire month is not an age appropriate expectation for 1st graders. \n\nAt that age, shorter term rewards are more effective.", "YTA\n\nYou're saying out of 24 first grade kids, Bobby was the **ONLY** one who didn't have perfect behavior for an entire month?  That's incredibly hard to believe.  \n\nI don't believe in the Speshul Snowflake, Everybody Gets a Trophy theory that's so prevalent these days, but c'mon!  I don't know of any 6 y/o who is perfectly behaved all the time.", "While the idea seems sound, it feels quite cruel to only apply it to a single student - especially a kid that\u2019s already struggling. \n\nBeing singled out for punishment by a teacher is pretty humiliating and something he will likely remember for the rest of his life. And not in a good way. I speak from experience as your post brought back several specific long buried memories like this and all I can think is those teachers were fracking AHs. (Not that you are, of course, but \ud83d\udcaf% this kid will remember you like that. And his mom.)\n\nWe know what lesson you were trying to teach your students, but what did this student actually learn? Because it\u2019s definitely not the one you were trying to teach him.", "I have to ask how long you have taught this age group? It doesn't sound like you fully understand the pedagogy of this age group yet. Kids do not want to misbehave for the sake of misbehaving. It is because they do not yet have the skills to deal with certain situations appropriately. That may be due to underlying issues beyond their control or learned behaviour. Either way, they haven't learned the proper skills and as adults we need to set them up for success so that they begin to use those skills independently. And no, this does not mean everyone gets a sticker for every little thing they do. But expecting all kids (especially a student with an IEP) to reach a goal of perfection (good behaviour for an entire month) is setting some students up for failure. As an educator you should know that setting unattainable goals is not how you motivate students to do better. The one child in your care who needs the most help regulating their behaviour is punished for not reaching a goal you knew they'd have difficulty reaching. Can you imagine the mounting frustration he must have felt as he watched his noodle remain empty, knowing he would never be able to fill it? Did you think that would motivate him to suddenly acquire skills he doesn't have? Or do you think that might have made his behaviour worse? Was there not even small acts throughout the month that could have earned him points? Hopefully this has some magical effect and he is \"cured\" but most likely he will remember forever that he could never be good enough.", "Well is Bobby the only excluded student? Was he clearly trying hard to earn them?", "Come on, YTA. How old is the kid \u2014 5? Excluding the kid will make him a target for his classmates, if he isn\u2019t one already. And the kid probably feels crappy enough as it is. \n\nCome on, teacher, SMH. You could have handled this better.", "I'd say this would be reasonable punishment in grade 4 at the earliest. 1st graders are 6 - 7 years old? What kind of behavioral issues do you think a 6 year old has that aren't caused by some extrinsic factors that are out of their control (e.g. bad parenting for instance as can be a bit implied from what you are saying about their parent) now that kid not only has something stressing them out that you don't know about, they now have you excluding him from his peers at a party and the shame he must feel for that. Do you even remember what it felt like to be 6 years old? YTA.", "YTA - For posting this without saying what the behavioral issues are, what he's been tested for and what the results say, and what the plan is to get him on track.", "YTA sorry. The kid is in first grade and this is ableist. Many first graders do not have control over all their faculties yet and he might not even recognize good behavior from \"bad\" if it's not laid out or scaffolded for him.\n\nIf these were high schoolers with para educators or educational supports in place, it might work. But first grade? Nah. Let the kid eat glue and taunt the class hamster or whatever. He may grow up to be a world-renowned mixed-media hamster portrait artist.", "I\u2019m going with YTA - this kid will remember for ever how he failed and missed out because his behaviour wasn\u2019t at a standard that you determined. Knowing that he has behaviour issues, now you\u2019re excluding him.. how do you think that could impact the already vulnerable kid? It isn\u2019t going to encourage him to do better\u2026 more so make him feel more isolated than he probably already does.", "This isn\u2019t okay. You\u2019re teaching 1st grade - not 10th! They\u2019re too young and immature to fully understand why you\u2019re ostracizing them and it can\u2019t come as a surprise to you that this can lead to mocking of the child who failed to \u201cbehave\u201d. \nGood grief. Wasn\u2019t pedagogy and empathy a part of your curriculum at all? Find a more age appropriate way to award good behavior. YTA", "Info: How many stickers did he miss it by?", "If you exclude just him while in first  grade, he will remember you for the rest of his life. Have some compassion and realize you may not know what he experiences outside of the classroom. YTA", "INFO: Does bobby have a diagnosis for his behavioral issues? Or does he just \"not listen\"", "YTA that\u2019s not okay what you did to Bobby, and I wanna know what issues, ADHD? Down Syndrome? A little over excitable because he\u2019s a first grader?? So the whole class got to go and not him? Thats messed up, you just taught him that because he\u2019s different he can\u2019t do what the other kids get to to do. \n\nFYI I have ADHD and I was diagnosed at the age of 7, being different in school is already rough, but adding teachers who treat you like shit because of your behavior? Makes it way worse, because you don\u2019t get the help you need.", "YTA\n\n You likely could have predicted 1-2 students would fail to get all the stickers. I agree that a person should stick to what they say; in this case you should have left some leeway. You set this up and should have foreseen this exact outcome. \n\nThis is going to be rough for a 6 year old to handle. Being the sole kid to be excluded might feel pretty bad. \n\nThe real question is; would you feel good about it if you were 6? Put yourself in the kids shoes; they will hear about the BBG from their friends for the rest of term. \n\nIf you can honestly say, you would be fine with being the only kid excluded, then feel free to ignore my judgment.", "YTA. Not a good way to encourage or reward behavior, especially for kids of this age.", "YTA - I remember my primary/elementary school having a similar thing. Every year the \u201cgood\u201d kids would get a feed while the \u201cbad\u201d kids, whom were all aged from 5 to 8, would literally have to hear about how great the food was and how sad it must be that they didn\u2019t go. \n\nThe exclusion never made them better at emoting or being \u201cgood\u201d. It just put them into a box for their school life at least. You\u2019ve put that box around Bobby, congratulations.\n\nDon\u2019t encourage events that have a chance of excluding your students.", "INFO by behavioral issues, are you referring to a disability of some sort?", "YTA. That seems like a huge punishment for a first grader. It seems alienating. Is there not something else that can be a consequence of not enough noodles? \n\nI get the principle, but a kid can only understand so much about consequences at that age.", "YES! You\u2019re a teacher asking if excluding 6 year olds from a party is wrong? I mean if you have to ask that\u2019s pretty fucked. At these early years you should be trying to make them feel included and welcomed. Things like this is how children learn to be social.", "YTA- holy shit YTA. \u201cBehavioral issues\u201d is such a broad term and since you teach at a private school you don\u2019t have to follow IEP or 504 plans but you have had him ALL year and knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. You set him up to fail. My kid has adhd and autism and his brain works differently and so he needs different things to help him. His teacher came up with some great things that help him be his best. We got him a 504 plan so any teacher after will follow those guidelines. That poor kid", "YTA i dont think you can say it\u2019s a fair assessment of the situation if they where trying their best and where probably close then that seems kinda ableist to exclude one student because they possibly had a few more bad \u201cbehaviour\u201d days then a \u201cnormal kid\u201d. Not all students with \u201cbehavioural issues \u201c deserve that particular label because that\u2019s glossing over that fact it\u2019s not always a choice in behaviour. To me alienating those students is wrong because it will make them feel even more isolated then they already probably feel,you have not given enough information about the circumstances of the child which leads me to believe you kinda know you are not in the right here.", "First grade, and you\u2019re singling this young student out amongst his classmates? \n\nYou need to do better, be kinder, and dig a little deeper regarding why your student\u2019s behavior might not be on par with others. \n\nMy heart is aching for this 6 year old. He\u2019ll always remember this. He might not remember your name or face as he gets older (although he probably will), but he\u2019ll always remember that you set him aside. \n\nWhy are you doing this to a child? \n\nYTA", "YTA. These are 6 year olds. The punishment for bad behavior isn\u2019t being excluded from the barbecue.

When my boss makes an overwhelming or unachievable goal, I do not feel more motivated to meet it the next month.

Data indicates that students with disabilities are disciplined at least 2.5 times more often than peers. (More so if they are non-white.) Exclusion is a punishment. \n\nStudents with behavioral challenges lack important thinking skills necessary to regulate emotions. More than likely you won\u2019t be the last teacher to do this.

The bbq probably gets discussed in class- this sounds like it will alienate students.\n\nEdit to add: a month is way too long a timeframe for something like this at that age.

But this kid cannot be helped if the adults around him don't take the extra time to figure things out.", "Oh? This wasn't mentioned initially. That definitely changes it to YTA", "What's insane to me is the people in this comment saying the OP is wrong. Like, how? The expectations were laid out clearly, the child did not meet the expectations, therefore they don't get the reward. The claim that the child is being singled out, and this will result in possible bullying and ostracization is laughable as well. Social conditioning is exactly how we get kids to behave and later on participate coherently in society. Does it suck that he is going to miss the barbecue? Sure. But will this be a lesson learned in the long run? Absolutely. This idea of allowing a kid to skirt the rules because \"his feelings might get hurt\" is kind of the whole point. Kids need to feel the sting of mistakes made for them to sink in. This coddle generation is raising more coddle generations", "The parent may have initiated this IEP, but that doesn't mean that the issues are being addressed at home.

Hopefully next year he has a better one and still has enough trust to open up to it. \n\nI remember the teacher who destroyed my love of school. Her name was Mrs Greere and she was a bitch. Anyone who was even slightly different was an abomination in her eyes, I became a target because I could already read beyond my grade level and she hated me for it. \n\nI got left at school during a field trip for \u201cnot turning in my homework\u201d.

But she claimed I \u201csnuck\u201d it into her desk so I still didn\u2019t get to go. \n\nI went from a kid who loved school to one who would injure myself or make myself sick so I didn\u2019t have to go. And I never got over it either.\n\nFuck Mrs Greere. Her husband cheated on her when I was in high school and a bunch of her former students sent her cards telling her it was her fault and she was too ugly inside and out for any man to be happy married to, lol.

Knowing to practice body basics, kind words, and doing what you're told is day-1 lessons & although we don't expect perfection, neither did the OP & they state this in comments. The student continued to fail & lost the privilege of the BBQ. This could be the turning point that the kid needs to realize cause & effect.

They absolutely understand expectations & rules, they most likely have adults making excuses for them which is why they never truly learn.", "Better that than an IUD.", "[removed]", "Without knowing the accommodations or the child\u2019s situation it is difficult to say if the teacher was being reasonable. Excluding one child makes it a special punishment rather than a reward for a few really good students. Add to that they are 6.
