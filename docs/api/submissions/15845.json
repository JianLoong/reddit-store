Bobby would join another class for the day and do work inside while his classmates were at the barbecue. \n\nShe has been sending emails complaining to myself and the principal all week about how her child should also be able to participate and it is unfair.

These are 1st graders.  From what you've posted,  it sounds like this was the only student excluded. There is literally no way that is going to encourage better behavior from this young child in the future. \n\nKids, especially young ones,  often act out in reaction to emotional stimuli they don't have the appropriate tools to process yet.  99% of the time,  a kid of 1st grade age who is acting out has trouble somewhere - stress/problems at home,  getting bullied, who knows.  For the same reason it's unfair to punish young kids for tardiness or attendance issues,  it's unfair to expect a kid this young to \"behave\" all the time when you have no idea what might be happening in their lives that isn't in their control. \n\nPublicly excluding one child is going to make behavior issues worse.  You're turning them into a pariah to their peers - kids can be mean,  and honestly don't need much to single someone out as \"other.\" \n\nI know you want to use some kind of reward system for the kids who are behaving the way you want,  but you're talking about 6 year olds! Something as big as a BBQ at the park should have been an all-or-nothing class goal. Singling out the one kid who is having trouble (which, again, you as the teacher will almost NEVER know the true source of) is bullying. \n\nIf these were high schoolers that would be one thing - teenagers are more mature and can be expected to have more control over their behavior - but we're talking about kids who are only SIX years old. \n\nYou need to rethink your reward system,  keeping in mind age-appropriate expectations for these children.\n\nEdit: some of your comments specify that this kid has an IEP. 100% YTA. A kid that young who already has an IEP is never going to be able to meet that level of behavioral expectation, regardless of whatever accommodations the IEP calls for. Perfection for a month! You set this kid up to fail. Hopefully not on purpose,  but that's still the outcome. Learn from this in the future.", "[removed]", "YTA its kinda shitty to do that with a first grader", "YTA\n\nSingling out a child who you know have behavioural issues and possibly can\u2019t control certain things and you\u2019re punishing them for it?\n\nI\u2019m glad our teachers recognise effort, we all have shit days and this is one of your massive ones! Glad you don\u2019t teach my kids!", "YTA. *Perfect* behavior for an entire month is not an age appropriate expectation for 1st graders. \n\nAt that age, shorter term rewards are more effective.", "YTA\n\nYou're saying out of 24 first grade kids, Bobby was the **ONLY** one who didn't have perfect behavior for an entire month?  That's incredibly hard to believe.  \n\nI don't believe in the Speshul Snowflake, Everybody Gets a Trophy theory that's so prevalent these days, but c'mon!  I don't know of any 6 y/o who is perfectly behaved all the time.", "While the idea seems sound, it feels quite cruel to only apply it to a single student - especially a kid that\u2019s already struggling. \n\nBeing singled out for punishment by a teacher is pretty humiliating and something he will likely remember for the rest of his life. And not in a good way. I speak from experience as your post brought back several specific long buried memories like this and all I can think is those teachers were fracking AHs. (Not that you are, of course, but \ud83d\udcaf% this kid will remember you like that. And his mom.)\n\nWe know what lesson you were trying to teach your students, but what did this student actually learn? Because it\u2019s definitely not the one you were trying to teach him.", "I have to ask how long you have taught this age group? It doesn't sound like you fully understand the pedagogy of this age group yet. Kids do not want to misbehave for the sake of misbehaving. It is because they do not yet have the skills to deal with certain situations appropriately. That may be due to underlying issues beyond their control or learned behaviour. Either way, they haven't learned the proper skills and as adults we need to set them up for success so that they begin to use those skills independently. And no, this does not mean everyone gets a sticker for every little thing they do. But expecting all kids (especially a student with an IEP) to reach a goal of perfection (good behaviour for an entire month) is setting some students up for failure. As an educator you should know that setting unattainable goals is not how you motivate students to do better. The one child in your care who needs the most help regulating their behaviour is punished for not reaching a goal you knew they'd have difficulty reaching. Can you imagine the mounting frustration he must have felt as he watched his noodle remain empty, knowing he would never be able to fill it? Did you think that would motivate him to suddenly acquire skills he doesn't have? Or do you think that might have made his behaviour worse? Was there not even small acts throughout the month that could have earned him points? Hopefully this has some magical effect and he is \"cured\" but most likely he will remember forever that he could never be good enough.", "Well is Bobby the only excluded student? Was he clearly trying hard to earn them?", "Come on, YTA. How old is the kid \u2014 5? Excluding the kid will make him a target for his classmates, if he isn\u2019t one already. And the kid probably feels crappy enough as it is. \n\nCome on, teacher, SMH. You could have handled this better.", "I'd say this would be reasonable punishment in grade 4 at the earliest. 1st graders are 6 - 7 years old? What kind of behavioral issues do you think a 6 year old has that aren't caused by some extrinsic factors that are out of their control (e.g. bad parenting for instance as can be a bit implied from what you are saying about their parent) now that kid not only has something stressing them out that you don't know about, they now have you excluding him from his peers at a party and the shame he must feel for that.

YTA.", "YTA - For posting this without saying what the behavioral issues are, what he's been tested for and what the results say, and what the plan is to get him on track.", "YTA sorry. The kid is in first grade and this is ableist. Many first graders do not have control over all their faculties yet and he might not even recognize good behavior from \"bad\" if it's not laid out or scaffolded for him.\n\nIf these were high schoolers with para educators or educational supports in place, it might work. But first grade? Nah. Let the kid eat glue and taunt the class hamster or whatever. He may grow up to be a world-renowned mixed-media hamster portrait artist.", "I\u2019m going with YTA - this kid will remember for ever how he failed and missed out because his behaviour wasn\u2019t at a standard that you determined. Knowing that he has behaviour issues, now you\u2019re excluding him.. how do you think that could impact the already vulnerable kid? It isn\u2019t going to encourage him to do better\u2026 more so make him feel more isolated than he probably already does.", "This isn\u2019t okay. You\u2019re teaching 1st grade - not 10th!

Or does he just \"not listen\"", "YTA that\u2019s not okay what you did to Bobby, and I wanna know what issues, ADHD? Down Syndrome? A little over excitable because he\u2019s a first grader?? So the whole class got to go and not him? Thats messed up, you just taught him that because he\u2019s different he can\u2019t do what the other kids get to to do. \n\nFYI I have ADHD and I was diagnosed at the age of 7, being different in school is already rough, but adding teachers who treat you like shit because of your behavior? Makes it way worse, because you don\u2019t get the help you need.", "YTA\n\n You likely could have predicted 1-2 students would fail to get all the stickers. I agree that a person should stick to what they say; in this case you should have left some leeway. You set this up and should have foreseen this exact outcome. \n\nThis is going to be rough for a 6 year old to handle. Being the sole kid to be excluded might feel pretty bad. \n\nThe real question is; would you feel good about it if you were 6? Put yourself in the kids shoes; they will hear about the BBG from their friends for the rest of term. \n\nIf you can honestly say, you would be fine with being the only kid excluded, then feel free to ignore my judgment.", "YTA. Not a good way to encourage or reward behavior, especially for kids of this age.", "YTA - I remember my primary/elementary school having a similar thing. Every year the \u201cgood\u201d kids would get a feed while the \u201cbad\u201d kids, whom were all aged from 5 to 8, would literally have to hear about how great the food was and how sad it must be that they didn\u2019t go. \n\nThe exclusion never made them better at emoting or being \u201cgood\u201d. It just put them into a box for their school life at least. You\u2019ve put that box around Bobby, congratulations.\n\nDon\u2019t encourage events that have a chance of excluding your students.", "INFO by behavioral issues, are you referring to a disability of some sort?", "YTA. That seems like a huge punishment for a first grader. It seems alienating. Is there not something else that can be a consequence of not enough noodles? \n\nI get the principle, but a kid can only understand so much about consequences at that age.", "YES! You\u2019re a teacher asking if excluding 6 year olds from a party is wrong? I mean if you have to ask that\u2019s pretty fucked. At these early years you should be trying to make them feel included and welcomed. Things like this is how children learn to be social.", "YTA- holy shit YTA. \u201cBehavioral issues\u201d is such a broad term and since you teach at a private school you don\u2019t have to follow IEP or 504 plans but you have had him ALL year and knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. You set him up to fail. My kid has adhd and autism and his brain works differently and so he needs different things to help him. His teacher came up with some great things that help him be his best. We got him a 504 plan so any teacher after will follow those guidelines. That poor kid", "YTA i dont think you can say it\u2019s a fair assessment of the situation if they where trying their best and where probably close then that seems kinda ableist to exclude one student because they possibly had a few more bad \u201cbehaviour\u201d days then a \u201cnormal kid\u201d. Not all students with \u201cbehavioural issues \u201c deserve that particular label because that\u2019s glossing over that fact it\u2019s not always a choice in behaviour. To me alienating those students is wrong because it will make them feel even more isolated then they already probably feel,you have not given enough information about the circumstances of the child which leads me to believe you kinda know you are not in the right here.", "First grade, and you\u2019re singling this young student out amongst his classmates? \n\nYou need to do better, be kinder, and dig a little deeper regarding why your student\u2019s behavior might not be on par with others. \n\nMy heart is aching for this 6 year old. He\u2019ll always remember this.

Data indicates that students with disabilities are disciplined at least 2.5 times more often than peers. (More so if they are non-white.) Exclusion is a punishment. \n\nStudents with behavioral challenges lack important thinking skills necessary to regulate emotions. More than likely you won\u2019t be the last teacher to do this.

The bbq probably gets discussed in class- this sounds like it will alienate students.\n\nEdit to add: a month is way too long a timeframe for something like this at that age.

Sadly, in the younger grades is when students will learn that they either love or hate school and if they are a good or bad kid. More than teaching curriculum, as a 1st grade teacher, your job is to help your students to learn to love school and that everyone learns differently and that\u2019s ok. Even though the oldest to youngest are about a chronological year apart, that doesn\u2019t mean they are all on the same level in every category of maturity.

When they start pre-k, disabled children are often happy but can't follow the rules and can't achieve the learning objectives set for the group. When teachers fail to help them adequately and to adjust expectations, children react with minor behavioral issues. Teachers fail to be empathetic and rather than seek help to understand the kids, they end up using inadequate reward/punishment systems with behavioral goals children are already unable to attain, thus increasing even more their feeling of failure and hopelessness. And then they wonder why behaviors keep getting worse and worse until they are no longer manageable. Now, the only thing this child has learned is that no matter the efforts, it is never going to be enough and school is cruel. So why bother trying? Honestly, I can't count the times we've solved behavioral issues by letting summer go by and the kid gets a different, more empathic teacher.", "Arguably, given other comments and my own shitty experiences with the public school system and IEPs and having to lawyer up, the parents of the kid could probably bring some MAJOR legal trouble onto OP. It's going to be *very* hard for them to prove they didn't discriminate against this one kid if I'm understanding other comments they made correctly. Fucking hell.", "Somewhere in a box I have like 5 participation ribbons from science fairs 15-20 years ago.

How do you all come together to create a harmonious and safe classroom environment? That means including those with disabilities instead of succumbing to cancel culture and canceling the kid who's not falling in line \n\nLuckily the tide is turning and it seems like educators are tuning into more progressive, humanitarian ways of actually educating--not the antiquated dictatorship that fuels OP's need for control and homogeny", "He only missed ONE!

There were two teacher though and the other one really liked me so she would go out of her way to protect me. \n\nWhen I moved on to first grade my 1st grade teacher had to go on maternity leave and guess who the sub was? The evil teacher from kindie. \n\nI will never forget how she shamed me in front of the whole class for messing up the cursive upper case A.

I remember crying and being so ashamed (even typing this out now makes my eyes fill with tears \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude14). I was so terrified of it happening again I completely stopped doing my homework. I would get a million notes telling my parents that I wasn\u2019t completing my work and they were at a loss on what to do. They went to the school multiple times, talked to the principal, talked to me, to the teacher, but I was just too scared to tell them what happened. I was so ashamed. I didn\u2019t want them to be mad that their daughter was \u201cdumb.\u201d Now I know they would have totally have had my back and would have wreaked havoc in the school. Many years later, when I told my parents, they about came unglued. They would have gone full scorched earth on this teacher, but they didn\u2019t know.\n\nAnyway, all of this to say, the trauma scarred me for life. For many years to come I couldn\u2019t even eat breakfast before going to school because I would throw up, my anxiety was so bad. \n\nIn high school I had a teacher approach my desk to check my work and I burst into tears.

Maybe one day I\u2019ll shove it in their faces, or maybe I should thank them for making me want to spite them by succeeding so hard. Thanks for all the work you do!", "Through experience I find that nothing can be a bigger misconception that to become teachers it means you like and wish to help kids. Looking back at my childhood, it was pre internet/early internet times, mental health and development were kind of taboo etc but there were teachers who were just malicious.", "I didn't when it happened to me. I have it on very good authority that I was a little shit for the rest of the school year and my behavior plummeted. To my 8 year old mind, why bother even trying if there's only another punishment at the end? And he's even younger, bless him.", "She said somewhere in the comments that the chart is handled differently for him which makes me the probably has different goals or gets more chances to get a good mark. The problem is that it's often the sticker charts and public displays themselves that are ineffective or actively harmful to kids. Sure, for a lot of people, there's a clean line from punishment or reward to future behavior but it doesn't work like that for everyone. I have seen goal sheets break kids, increase distress, and make their behavior worse.", "I remember the first time I got a participation trophy as a kid. When they gave it to me, I was briefly taken aback and pissed off because I thought I was being made fun of for losing. My mom explained it to me after she saw me throw the trophy in the trash and thought I was being disrespectful. It still has never fully made sense to me why anybody would want a trophy for not winning.", "Yes! I remember my 1st grade teacher and getting yelled at in front of the whole class (dont lift your pen while writing cursive kinda thing). It was because she said I didn't keep my chalk down the entire time while writing cursive. I am probably older, but I held the chalk down, but it just skipped across the board. Idk how to explain it, but I must have been holding it at just the wrong angle or something. I remember that day so clearly,and the class laughing at me. It was one of those core memories the movie Inside Out reminds me of.", "I was a sick kid. I had meningitis as a baby and throughout primary school til 11 seemed to get every sickness going. I missed at least a *term* of school every year. It was the 80s, no one realised the meningitis had triggered a neurological illness similar to long covid, IEP type help did not exist and my parents DGAF. I was hospitalised a lot and my neglectful ass parents used to leave me home alone ill from age 6 to the point I had no idea that was weird or illegal.\n\nWe had selective education so we sat an exam called 11 plus to divide us for high school on academics. (Ah Northern Ireland!) and I passed with the highest grade band despite missing about a quarter of my schooling and no extra support. I also won the English prize which was a trophy at our last year of primary school which was a big deal.\n\nI was allowed on stage to accept it while the headmistress bitched that standards must have slipped since Little Gerbil barely graced us with her attendence which was the worst she had seen in her career. If that was not humiliating enough, at the party afterwards for \u2018graduating\u2019 because I didn\u2019t get an attendence certificate, I was made to sit on a chair in the corner alone and not have any of the food or drink or join in because \u2018I did not deserve a reward.\u2019\n\nI was 11. I\u2019m 44. Aside from the fact my fucking grades were better than half the kids with 100% attendence who did fuck all except be kids at school, I had prioritised education, made massive effort to attend and every single step was so much harder for me than the healthy kids and to be told not matter how hard I tried by being \u2018different\u2019 or \u2018other\u2019 by not having \u2018normal\u2019 health I learned I was not good enough and no one would extend compassion to a struggling kid.\n\nAnd because I was smart and mature for 11 I knew that meant if no one would extend compassion for a sick kid, adulthood and my teens were going to be brutal. I was hospitalised for 7 weeks after that event and it was not as bad as the utter crippling shame of being singled out and bullied by adults, educators who said education isn\u2019t for all kids. The irony being my mother was a teacher\u2026\n\nI missed a huge amount of high school and didn\u2019t get my GED equivalent. When I was about 16 I changed school and my head teacher was the first to champion that I was doing my best and stood up for me. He helped me get post school admission as a mature student to one of the best universities in the country but more to the point taught me I had inherent value and built my confidence.\n\nI absolutely excelled until my university pulled a similar stunt as primary school. I was a self supporting student and I applied for a hardship fund because I had three jobs, studied full time, had only just moved to England so no support network and literally had no money to eat. They straight up said it was a waste to fund the disabled student because what would I amount to?\n\nI ended up homeless. I did not get my degree. I did spend a lot of time on social security. Some might have been because I was so sick that was unavoidable no matter the support but a lot of it was because I learnt so early from adults I looked up to that \u2018nice things aren\u2019t for kids like you. You are different and should never forget it.\u2019\n\nI have also done stuff that frankly makes my abled peers look average (no offence) but every single time I apply for a job, have to write that lack of qualification on forms and fear the same fucking \u2018fuck off you are not a good enough noodle\u2019 vibe I am that 11 year wracked with shame and self loathing and self doubt and unfairness.\n\nIt is bullying. I will never be abled and yes I \u2018fail\u2019 when I try but if you offer me reasonable adjustments and kindness, I can excel as a disabled person or just as myself where being disabled is one part of me. But it also rankles that 100% attendence still gets clapped even when I see presenteeism up the wazoo (when I\u2019m working I don\u2019t have time to scroll\u2026) but no one has ever said \u2018you did all this with 100 hospital admissions and counting? Well done.\u2019\n\nI still get sent to the seat alone and this is the bit they like to leave out of \u2018hmmm, why do we have such a big disability employment gap? Oh we teach \u2018em to feel small and shitty from the start!\u2019 If you don\u2019t have parents who can advocate like a second full time job for kids with additionsl needs, you are fucked. It\u2019s 2023. I sat on that chair in 1990 in a country mid civil war where nothing was normal which excuses some and yet no change.\n\nThe OP is such an AH. I have never told anyone the story IRL. I moved school district not to face my peers again it was so awful and opened me up to such bullying and gossip. And recounting it makes cry nearly 35 years later. That teacher probably never remember my name but she had been my favourite so it crushed me that I \u2018made her mad.\u2019 Now I think she was less an educator and just a power tripping empathy void but that means I was probably only one of hundreds of kids she damaged.\n\nPeople trust you OP with their children, the future of our society and you turn that it into power battle over a good noodle sticker with a what 6 year old? Wow. You are the reason you may always remember the name of a good teacher but you never forget the hurt of a bad teacher. And you are terrible at modelling good learning lessons to very young kids and having the self awareness to catch yourself on.\n\nYou don\u2019t deserve the bbq or end of year gifts. FYI I never bought a single teacher a gift because none of them gifted me professionalism and I only wonder what level they\u2019d have exposed if my school wasn\u2019t all white or if they\u2019d realised I was queer too. This is why laws controlling what teachers say matter because teaching already often builds in biases and needs no encouragement to up it\u2026", "Same. My son had a teacher like OP, and I cried many times, feeling like she didn't deserve to teach my child... He had so much to give, but it didn't fit in her narrow window", "Wow, it's evil that you had to turn your desks around while still in the classroom. Wtf.", "For a lot of kids participation itself may be a struggle due to a variety of factors, support through inclusion is the minimum needed for them and it will also support the children who have the potential to thrive. Sportsmanship is important, constant competition is unhealthy and it shows in the individual and the society in general. Every time I hear someone complain for participation prizes I think of the phrase \"hurt people hurt people\"", "I remember being in preschool and my teacher making me redo my coloring cause I colored the acorn's nose red. \nAnd also not being allowed to take my nap toy out when other kids were.", "I have a similar story, but it was at 5th grade where we would practice sums. Our teacher would give us a list of sums to solve and I was quite slow. When everyone was done I was halfway and he thought I was just slacking on purpose so I was punished. I was slow with doing sums because the idea was to solve them from memory. My memory is fucked so I needed to solve all of them one by one. Now, as an adult, I learned my bad memory is linked to my ADD which wasn't known at the time.\n\nNow I have a degree in Engineering. I can do calculus easily but maths without a calculator is still hard!", "Omg! I just made a comment about my first grade teacher and cursive. Mine was the uppercase Q and I didn't hold my chalk down the entire time (you don't lift your pen during cursive thing). I did though! My chalk just skipped across the chalkboard. My whole class laughed. I still remember it clear as day.", "Yesss!!! Progress, not perfection!!! And holy hell, OP had an opportunity to model empathy, teamwork, and inclusivity all at once had she simply made it a *group* effort, vs on an individual basis? Like had she set it up so that the class *collectively* reaching a *reasonable* goal earned the entire class a reward, then the kids could be working *together*, essentially helping and *teaching one another*, in order to get that reward!!? Instead, OP set ALL of them up to fail, even the ones with perfect noodles, because what they\u2019ve learned now is that they are each expected to be perfect (***no one is***), that when you are not perfect you *will* be punished (how exactly is that conducive to learning??), to fear failure, and to judge others harshly. \n\nPunishing him!!? Singling him out without ever even acknowledging that this poor **child** is *struggling*? And that without support he has little to no hope of even improving, let alone ever meeting her unimaginably cruel expectations? Every each child is unique, with their own unique strengths and challenges, and teaching them that so long as you \u201cbehave\u201d, how you treat others, and even how you feel about yourself, isn\u2019t important? That\u2019s abusive. \n\nFear has no place in the classroom. \n\nThis teacher has no place anywhere *near* children. Ever. \n\nAnd that principal too. \n\nJFC this might be one of the top 3 most infuriating posts I\u2019ve ever read here. \n\nOP, YTA YTA YTA and I hope you lose your job and are prevented from ever, ever, ever being responsible for a single more child\u2019s well-being, as you are clearly not just unfit, but outright abusive.", "My English teacher in secondary school said and did something that I've never forgotten. I would have been around 14/15 maybe? By that point I'd been bullied so much by my peers I'd developed social anxiety, but I didn't know it then. We're doing work in groups, I'm shy as heck and don't really know which part to help with or what anyone wants me to do.\n\nWhat does my teacher do? Ask me which part I want to help with? Give me something to do? Suggest I help another student with their part?\n\nNo. She takes me out of the classroom in front of everyone \\[So that was super fun for my social anxiety lol\\] and FOR SOME REASON asks me if I'm doing drugs, or if I'm drinking, or if something's wrong with me. I just shut up and replied No to all her questions because I had no idea what the hell she was thinking asking me these things.\n\nI've never forgotten that. That she had the opportunity to do the normal thing and instead went to the absolute opposite extreme instead."]}
