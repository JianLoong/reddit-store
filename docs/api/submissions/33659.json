And there\u2019s obviously nothing wrong with being financially comfortable. In my opinion though, that should make a person more conscious about things like this. When I\u2019m out with a friend who has less than me, I\u2019m never trying to split things when it\u2019s not even.", "Yeah. Plus, waiters can easily split the bill based on who got what.", "Soft YTA - assuming the cakes were ordered with the intention to share and the person who ordered 2 dishes did so with the intention to share as well rather than bringing the second meal home in a doggie bag. All this seems pretty common in a social outing.\n\nYes - I\u2019m going against the clear N T A consensus, but - hear me out. First, if I go out with a group of 6-7 people and 1-2 rack up a huge bar tab and then ask to split the bill - total AH move. \n\nI see this as fundamentally different in that it feels like people kept ordering food for the group rather than solely to engorge themselves. I\u2019ve been to several outings/celebrations with friends and business colleagues where they just keep ordering appetizers on top of meals so there\u2019s just way too much food. There wasn\u2019t any real abuse and everyone was fine just splitting the check. Or leaving notably more than their share if they left early. \n\nAnd, yes, in these scenarios, OP would\u2019ve been a total AH, although the rest of us would\u2019ve readily picked up their slack (but maybe not invited them next time as OP would have a different vibe than the rest of us). \n\nFor me, it only ventures into true AH territory when the main person calling to split the check has deliberately gamed the system for their own personal advantage. It sure didn\u2019t sound like that based on OP\u2019s description. Maybe a bit unfair, but not maliciously so.\n\nThat said, as others have said, if it really bothers OP that much, maybe this isn\u2019t the right crowd for you. Of course, that might not be an issue given you spent over 30 minutes arguing so they probably won\u2019t invite you back. Win-win for everyone! Yeah!", "NTA\nI was at a family dinner after a funeral and everyone attending had already reserved a plate a few days before. When they were being passed out I noticed my cousin wasn't eating. He said he didn't have the money. I told him to order a plate. I got you. As we're eating I notice he's going through mixed drinks at a rapid pace. Later the sever gave me the check and I told her I'm only paying for the food. And I left. No idea who paid for his drinks and haven't spoken to him since.", "Nta\n\n\nI don't like that they mentioned your income. Even if you do have more money, that's not a sign for you to pay for their habits. \n\n\nYou agree to pay for what you ordered. They are taking advantage. \n\n\nYou might need to thinknyour friends.", "NTA. I've never understood this concept of splitting everything up evenly like this. People that eat/drink less pay more than the ones that ate/drank more. You should have just gotten up, paid for your meal and left for them to figure out.", "NTA\n\nYour 'friends' PLANNED to order food they expected you to pay for. They didn't even care about the food. They just ordered food because they thought they could and get you to pay for it. They think that you are rich and want to spend your money for you. Why do they think you are rich? Why do they want to spend your money - even when they don't care about what it purchases?\n\n* You had agreed on separate checks in advance.\n* Not sure why you consider these people your friends, but if you are going to continue to hang out with them:\n\n1. Try to spend time doing things with them that don't involve money\n2. If you go out to eat, don't bring more cash than you intend to spend on yourself. Don't brink any form of debit or credit card.\n3. Tell them up front that it's separate checks. Tell the wait staff up front that it's separate checks, adding that if any person orders an item, it goes on that person's bill.\n4. If someone orders what seems like extra (e.g., two desserts), say, \"O*h! I hope you enjoy those two desserts that you are going to be paying for!*\"\n5. If they tell you that you don't have to keep bringing that up, tell them - \"*Apparently, I do. You seem to think I'm rich; you seem to want to spend my money. You seem to conveniently forget that we agreed on separate checks. Until I believe you've learned to stop trying to spend my money for me, I'll be making sure you are crystal clear that I will not be buying you things.*\"", "I hate peeps like this.  I love my friends, but I do not bust my tuckus so they can load up and put it on my bill.  If I offer, yes, if I don't, no.
