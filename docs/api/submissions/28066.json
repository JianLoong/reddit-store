Any other time is not a requirement.

You are his advisor. I am assuming you aren't making him call you \"Dr. AITA-23\", so it would be absolutely bizarre and uncomfortable if you started calling him \"lieutenant colonel [last name]\". Further, it would be unethical to treat him differently from the other PhD students because in the context of the program, and by the rules of collegiality, they are *equals*.", "Y T A. It's actually worse than just the title. You should be standing when he enters the room/lab, saluting, and stay at attention until he leaves or puts you at ease.

Optionally, you might consider paying for his meals and shoveling his snow in the winter.", "nope, you don't need to address anyone by any title, ever. titles are entirely optional, and in this instance, completely irrelevant. \n\nsomeone being in the military doesn't necessitate any special treatment whatsoever. in fact, most of them deserve less lmfao", "NAH, and I think most people are confused when they say NTA out of habit. No one is being an asshole here. Everyone\u2019s trying to figure out how to respect one another. \n\nI believe you have the choice. Some military personnel think you owe it to him. But don\u2019t you, as a professor, get respect in this particular relationship? \n\nBut let\u2019s be honest. If you want to live in a hierarchical world where you have to demand respect from your students, and/or, they want to strong arm you into demanding your respect based on their rank, does anyone actually want to live like that?

The Marine Corps is founded on a very tightly knit ground force with all the supporting elements drawn from within the ranks of the Corps, hence every Marine is a rifleman even if they are also an attack pilot. Regular ground forces (ie not SOF) almost universally throughout the world employ the use of rank and last name, deference to senior ranks as a means of enforcing the strict discipline they will rely on to perform well in the high stress environment of ground combat. The Airforce however adopts a more relaxed and collaborative style and the rigidity around rank and deference is rarely observed. I have served with an allied Airforce and can say this culture is very much the same across most Airforces, and is steeped in our tradition of Officers do the flying and the dying supported by the Enlisted who enable us, so we care for them in a different style to ensure that the support we get is based between a friendship type based loyalty, and of course, duty.
