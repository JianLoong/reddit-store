We\u2019ll call her Jane. Jane has a troubled history already at her age, drinking and doing minor drugs (weed) point is she isn\u2019t trusted.\n\nI get a call from my dad today with no notice of needing someone to watch her. I said absolutely no problem I got it covered and that the only issue is she needs to spend the nights at my house. I live 30 minutes away but work in the area during the work week so it\u2019s no problem to get her to and from school etc. My girlfriend and I have a 3 month old and I will NOT leave her for a week to care for a baby by herself.\n\nMy dads response was \u201cJane won\u2019t like that but I\u2019ll think on it for a few days.\u201d He offered to pay me $150 a day and I declined.\n\nI call my mother to establish a game plan and her response was \u201cno way are you going to make her wake up earlier and disrupt her life so you can be home\u201d  I was dumbfounded and she got pissed off and hung up the phone on me.\n\nSo my dad calls me again and he\u2019s with my oldest sister, may. May is a clinically diagnosed bi polar. She is unpredictable and overall a very bad person (I have very little contact) hence why they asked me to watch Jane. \n\nMay is in the background saying \u201cew no way he lives in the ghetto Jane isn\u2019t staying there\u201d when she lives in a shitty apartment on the shitty side of their city. I live in a farm town with about 6k population. I don\u2019t even know where she got that from? We\u2019re Very safe. May also has done every drug in the world and is of the mindset that \u201cI did drugs at that age and I turned out fine\u201d great person to stay with right? \n\nI got so sick of it I said \u201cdad I\u2019m so sorry to add stress to this but I\u2019m done, count me out I will not be helping. I will not stand mistreatment and being pushed around. Once again I\u2019m sorry but this isn\u2019t how it\u2019s gonna work\u201d  and he was confused and I hung up the phone.\n\nI feel bad for not being the one to help when I know I\u2019m the trusted person in the family to take care of things but I refuse to be pushed around over a 13 year old who won\u2019t sleep on a different bed for a week, she\u2019s extremely pampered and it shows via my mothers attitude about the situation. I\u2019m torn on this one but I laid my foot firm. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing to me that they put that much drama out all because Jane would have to wake up a half hour earlier to get ready for school, and not sleep in our spare room, but they want me to uproot my life for a week so I can play babysitter when I have much more responsibility, I can\u2019t just get up and leave for a week. \n\nAITA for refusing to watch my sister?\n\nEdit: I forgot to include they also need care for there 2 dogs which I adore them and they love coming to our property they like to run out and be free.

I\u2019m confused why they planned a trip without first ensuring Jane would have somewhere safe to be\u2026 much further out than two weeks. Guess they\u2019ll just have to take her lol. You have your own child to worry about. Let them figure out the situation with their child & maybe they\u2019ll be smarter next time.

I would probably pushback a little by insisting that Jane have a clean drug test before they leave too, just to make my point. You have a tiny baby and a contact high for a 3 month old or smoke exposure could be very dangerous so you really wouldn\u2019t be out of line. I would still go through with watching her in the end, but I\u2019d make them all work for it a little as a reminder that you\u2019re doing them a favor here and that they should at least be acting grateful. Make the rules Jane will be expected to follow while in your home and under your care clear to her and your parents too beforehand. It really sounds like your little sister could use a good influence and even some temporary boundaries in her life, which is a big reason that I would say to agree when they ask you again to watch her.

Not even close.\n\nYou have your own family now, you have your own responsibilities that are more important.\n\nFirst, they couldn't be bothered to give you proper notice that they needed help with your sister.
