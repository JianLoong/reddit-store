I\u2019m gonna refer to my parents as \u201cRyan\u201d(53 m) and \u201cTom\u201d (55 m)to make it easier to follow. My dads\u2019 breakup was messy and there\u2019s still a lot of animosity between them. Idk all the details because I was young when it happened and honestly I don\u2019t want to know because I love them both and I don\u2019t want my opinions to change on them. Neither of them say anything bad about one another to me but they definitely don\u2019t get along. \n\nOnto the issue. Both of them have good jobs and we\u2019ve always gone on really fun family vacations at the end of summer. Since they split, they each have continued to do those vacations and allowed me to choose which one I would go on. At first I just switched back and forth but the past few years it\u2019s almost become a competition. A few years ago Ryan chose to go to Hawaii and Tom chose London but once I decided on Hawaii Tom changed it to Tokyo because he knew I wanted to go there. This year Ryan chose Paris because I\u2019ve been obsessed since I was a kid and Tom chose Italy because visiting the colosseum is on my bucket list. I\u2019m sick of being the one that has to choose and I always feel so bad for the person I don\u2019t choose to go on a family vacation with. \n\nI talked to each of them one on one and basically said that I won\u2019t be going on any family vacations ever again until they can figure it out on their own. The competition makes it so stressful for me and I spend most of the vacation texting the other one because I feel bad. Tom told me he understood but Ryan told me that it\u2019s really hurting him that I won\u2019t go on any vacations ever again. I told him that I would go again once they worked it out and he said \u201cyou know that\u2019s never going to happen. We can\u2019t work anything out\u201d Idk what to do. Am I being mean? I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings and ik that I probably sound so spoiled but AITA?\n\n*Edited for clarity", "created_utc": 1683646493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cw4a0/aita_for_telling_my_parents_i_wont_go_on_vacation/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ryan is being childish. I mean, they can\u2019t work it out for their OWN daughter??? They are seriously immature putting your in the middle of this.", "NTA but your dad's are for putting you in the middle of their sick competition for your time & attention.  I agree with u/YouthNAsia63 \\- pick this year's vacay out of a hat, and then alternate years from here on out.  You are a human being, not a pawn for them to fight over and use against the other.", "NTA! One suggestion: Can you tell them you will go on vacations with them on alternating years. This year, Ryan, next year Tom? That will take away the competition. Flip a coin as to who you will go with this year.", "INFO. Why can't you attend both vacation plans? Unless they're intentionally scheduling them at the same time to force one dad to be left out...\n\nEdited to add... NTA either way OP!", "NTA. They have a created a situation where you are forced to disappoint one or the other every year. It might be best to go back to your previous policy of switching back and forth on a fixed schedule since choosing is causing you so much stress and unhappiness.", "Draw it out of a hat-*thats* the parent you go with this year. *Next* year-you go with the other one.

But you decided to be the adult here and put your foot down that they need to grow up.

But, the real solution here is to just tell both parents to alternate each year.  2023, Ryan and OP decide where to go.  Tom does not plan a vacation with OP.  2024, Tom and OP decide where to go.  Ryan does not plan a vacation with OP.  And so forth.", "NTA. But stop playing their game. Tell them you are staying home. Let them work out their pityness and learn to treat you as the adult you are and not some child they still can manipulate.", "NTA but I think you\u2019re wrong. ;-) It sounds entirely unrealistic to get these two to agree about this. I understand why you want them to, but I think you\u2019re going to have to make a choice yourself that sidesteps the competitive dynamic.
