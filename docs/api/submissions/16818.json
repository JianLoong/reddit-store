Both of them have good jobs and we\u2019ve always gone on really fun family vacations at the end of summer. Since they split, they each have continued to do those vacations and allowed me to choose which one I would go on. At first I just switched back and forth but the past few years it\u2019s almost become a competition. A few years ago Ryan chose to go to Hawaii and Tom chose London but once I decided on Hawaii Tom changed it to Tokyo because he knew I wanted to go there. This year Ryan chose Paris because I\u2019ve been obsessed since I was a kid and Tom chose Italy because visiting the colosseum is on my bucket list. I\u2019m sick of being the one that has to choose and I always feel so bad for the person I don\u2019t choose to go on a family vacation with. \n\nI talked to each of them one on one and basically said that I won\u2019t be going on any family vacations ever again until they can figure it out on their own. The competition makes it so stressful for me and I spend most of the vacation texting the other one because I feel bad. Tom told me he understood but Ryan told me that it\u2019s really hurting him that I won\u2019t go on any vacations ever again. I told him that I would go again once they worked it out and he said \u201cyou know that\u2019s never going to happen. We can\u2019t work anything out\u201d Idk what to do. Am I being mean?
