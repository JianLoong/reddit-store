She had never been to a funeral before. It started pretty much straight afterwards with her having funerals for her toys. \n\nThen a few weeks ago she started having funerals for herself. She lies down and says she\u2019s died and then Annabel says we have to dress nicely and come say nice things about Stacey. So she lies there while Annabel cries about how much she will miss her and then when we\u2019ve said enough nice things Stacey gets up and says she\u2019s alive and it\u2019s over for another few hours. Yesterday she did this 3 times.\n\nI can\u2019t take much more of this.\n\nAnnabel says that Stacey is conceptualising mortality for the first time and doing it in an incredibly creative way and I need to be supportive. She says I already conceptualised it when my own mom died and I need to be less selfish.

Your stepmother is  being incredibly insensitive.", "Sounds like your sister is enjoying the attention more than anything else. Since her mother is of no help, is it possible for you and your dad to redirect your sister towards a different outlet?\n\nYou could also be age appropriately frank with your sister and let her know that this is hurting your feelings.

This is a great moment to teach your sister sympathy that her mother is missing out on.", "NTA\n\nMortality is a thing that children do get exposed to, there are lots of questions, each child processes it in different ways.

Annabelle is welcome to parent Stacey on mortality, but not at your emotional expense. It sounds like this accident was very traumatic for you, and you need to be allowed to grieve and recover and NOT participate in triggering events.

It\u2019s true that your little sister\u2019s behavior is normal. She\u2019s learning about death in the way most children do, which is through pretend play. It can help her to understand and process the information. However, your feelings matter just as much as hers or anyone else\u2019s. It\u2019s incredibly wrong for your stepmother to shame you and tell you to either participate or be sent away. Please speak to your dad about this and what it does to your mental health. You have every right to avoid the \u201cpretend play\u201d without being chastised. You also really need to seek out grief counseling. You also need to be able to process your feelings about what happened. I can see how much guilt you feel and hope you\u2019ll seek counseling, it will help you so much to move past those feelings and process your grief. If your dad will not have your back, then please speak with your grandparents or your aunt and uncle. They may be grieving, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with the 3 of your grieving together. It may even encourage them to go to grief counseling as well.", "NTA. go talk to your dad about this. stacey needs support but you also need support as a young person who's had more than once serious trauma growing up. if people around you aren't willing to or able to help easing the pain you're feeling, you should seek a professional who can listen to you and help you. hope it's all gonna be better for you.", "Nobody should try to put a label or an esxpiration date on anybody else's griev.

I say NTA, but it would be good if you talk to your dad wife and your dad about how you're feeling and dealing with your sister process, learning conceptualising about mortality it's also learn about the impact of it on the ones that are alive.", "NTA. One fake funeral should've been enough but you shouldn't have had to participate in that, you're still a child yourself. 3 in one day just makes me feel she is attention seeking.", "NTA, and it's time your father and stepmum put a stop to this. It's on for your sister to have been fascinated with this and played it out in a child's way to deal with it, but you lost your mum, you lost your cousin, you definitily suffered enough trauma.", "NTA. \n\nYou're obviously processing some trauma around the loss of your cousin and that's not the same as losing your mother at a young age. You have different feelings around this than you did when you lost your mother, and your step mother is not letting you have the support you need to process and grieve. \n\nYour sister may well be processing death and funerals in a creative way, but that doesn't mean you have to support or participate in that, and her mother should not try to force you to. She needs to respect your grief and trauma, and not force you to participate in something that is holding you back.\n\nHave you spoken to your dad about what is happening and how you feel? Can he speak to your step mother on your behalf?", "It's all normal behavior and your step mom is right that you should tolerate it, but she's wrong that you have to participate.\n\nI'd give staying with your aunt and uncle a try. If you want to, you can tell them about what your sister is doing and how sad it makes you. They will understand. They might talk to your parents about treating you better.\n\nIf nothing else works for you, and the kid won't stop, sit her down and tell her that death is a one time thing. There are lots of children's books out there that help illustrate what death means in an age appropriate way. Tell her everyone only gets one funeral, so you will only go to one (more) funeral. After that, if she wants you at another funeral, you will be in the hospital (your bedroom) and you will send a teddy bear in your place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her mother was right to allow her to do this a few times, but multiple times per day for days on end is a bit much.  And to force you to participate when you're injured and grieving a traumatic loss is a pure AH move.  \n\nFor her to then double down by implying you should find other housing is just beyond the pale.

Your stepmom is being totally unreasonable.  It may be normal for your sister to put on these play funerals.

I think that's what almost any of us here would do.\n\nIt's also bizarre that she wants you to leave because it makes you uncomfortable.  Where is your dad?  Is he around?  Can he talk some sense into her about this?\n\nIt'd be nice if you could get away from this, if only for a while.  Do you have a close friend whose parents you could confide in?  I think they'd appreciate how bizarre and uncomfortable this is for you.  Maybe they'd let you stay at their place, if only for a weekend, to relieve some of your mental pressure.

I didn't understand what death was when I was a kid because my parents avoided the topic. I was 10 and couldn't grasp that my letters to my grandma wouldn't be read anymore. They wouldn't explain that her cancer was final for her. They just told me she's healthy enough to jog.

Tell your dad's parents, or even your mom's, if they're still around.\n\nAnd, if you have the time or energy for it, sit down with your sister and tell her gently what death is and how a funeral ends. Yes, everyone cries and says good things about the dead person. But then the dead person is placed in a box in the ground and we don't get to see them EVER AGAIN. And THAT'S why people are crying. Because someone we love went away very far from us and we can't see them anymore. Not even phones can reach them.

His name was Orlando and we would put him in a shoebox and cover the shoebox with a blanket to \u201cbury\u201d him.\n\nI tell this story because, to me, that is a reasonable way for young kids to play \u201cfuneral\u201d and conceptualize death. It is natural for your sister to be curious and ask questions. I think acting out her own funeral once is even understandable. It could be her way of reassuring herself that people would be sad and miss her if she died. Playing it over and over is excessive. It has become a game at this point, most likely, and a way for her to get attention. If she is genuinely distressed or fearful about death, then that needs to be addressed with her.

It even happens in natural disasters where no one can be at \"fault\". Idk how others are feeling or thinking about this situation but I do know that you need some extra support and help right now.
