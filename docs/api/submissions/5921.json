She had never been to a funeral before. It started pretty much straight afterwards with her having funerals for her toys. \n\nThen a few weeks ago she started having funerals for herself. She lies down and says she\u2019s died and then Annabel says we have to dress nicely and come say nice things about Stacey. So she lies there while Annabel cries about how much she will miss her and then when we\u2019ve said enough nice things Stacey gets up and says she\u2019s alive and it\u2019s over for another few hours. Yesterday she did this 3 times.\n\nI can\u2019t take much more of this.\n\nAnnabel says that Stacey is conceptualising mortality for the first time and doing it in an incredibly creative way and I need to be supportive. She says I already conceptualised it when my own mom died and I need to be less selfish.

Your stepmother is  being incredibly insensitive.", "Sounds like your sister is enjoying the attention more than anything else. Since her mother is of no help, is it possible for you and your dad to redirect your sister towards a different outlet?\n\nYou could also be age appropriately frank with your sister and let her know that this is hurting your feelings.

This is a great moment to teach your sister sympathy that her mother is missing out on.", "NTA\n\nMortality is a thing that children do get exposed to, there are lots of questions, each child processes it in different ways.

Annabelle is welcome to parent Stacey on mortality, but not at your emotional expense. It sounds like this accident was very traumatic for you, and you need to be allowed to grieve and recover and NOT participate in triggering events.

It\u2019s true that your little sister\u2019s behavior is normal. She\u2019s learning about death in the way most children do, which is through pretend play. It can help her to understand and process the information. However, your feelings matter just as much as hers or anyone else\u2019s. It\u2019s incredibly wrong for your stepmother to shame you and tell you to either participate or be sent away. Please speak to your dad about this and what it does to your mental health. You have every right to avoid the \u201cpretend play\u201d without being chastised. You also really need to seek out grief counseling. You also need to be able to process your feelings about what happened. I can see how much guilt you feel and hope you\u2019ll seek counseling, it will help you so much to move past those feelings and process your grief. If your dad will not have your back, then please speak with your grandparents or your aunt and uncle. They may be grieving, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with the 3 of your grieving together. It may even encourage them to go to grief counseling as well.", "NTA. go talk to your dad about this. stacey needs support but you also need support as a young person who's had more than once serious trauma growing up. if people around you aren't willing to or able to help easing the pain you're feeling, you should seek a professional who can listen to you and help you. hope it's all gonna be better for you.", "Nobody should try to put a label or an esxpiration date on anybody else's griev.

I say NTA, but it would be good if you talk to your dad wife and your dad about how you're feeling and dealing with your sister process, learning conceptualising about mortality it's also learn about the impact of it on the ones that are alive.", "NTA. One fake funeral should've been enough but you shouldn't have had to participate in that, you're still a child yourself. 3 in one day just makes me feel she is attention seeking.", "NTA, and it's time your father and stepmum put a stop to this. It's on for your sister to have been fascinated with this and played it out in a child's way to deal with it, but you lost your mum, you lost your cousin, you definitily suffered enough trauma.", "NTA. \n\nYou're obviously processing some trauma around the loss of your cousin and that's not the same as losing your mother at a young age. You have different feelings around this than you did when you lost your mother, and your step mother is not letting you have the support you need to process and grieve. \n\nYour sister may well be processing death and funerals in a creative way, but that doesn't mean you have to support or participate in that, and her mother should not try to force you to. She needs to respect your grief and trauma, and not force you to participate in something that is holding you back.\n\nHave you spoken to your dad about what is happening and how you feel? Can he speak to your step mother on your behalf?", "It's all normal behavior and your step mom is right that you should tolerate it, but she's wrong that you have to participate.\n\nI'd give staying with your aunt and uncle a try. If you want to, you can tell them about what your sister is doing and how sad it makes you. They will understand. They might talk to your parents about treating you better.\n\nIf nothing else works for you, and the kid won't stop, sit her down and tell her that death is a one time thing. There are lots of children's books out there that help illustrate what death means in an age appropriate way. Tell her everyone only gets one funeral, so you will only go to one (more) funeral. After that, if she wants you at another funeral, you will be in the hospital (your bedroom) and you will send a teddy bear in your place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her mother was right to allow her to do this a few times, but multiple times per day for days on end is a bit much.  And to force you to participate when you're injured and grieving a traumatic loss is a pure AH move.  \n\nFor her to then double down by implying you should find other housing is just beyond the pale.

Your stepmom is being totally unreasonable.  It may be normal for your sister to put on these play funerals.

I think that's what almost any of us here would do.\n\nIt's also bizarre that she wants you to leave because it makes you uncomfortable.  Where is your dad?  Is he around?  Can he talk some sense into her about this?\n\nIt'd be nice if you could get away from this, if only for a while.  Do you have a close friend whose parents you could confide in?  I think they'd appreciate how bizarre and uncomfortable this is for you.  Maybe they'd let you stay at their place, if only for a weekend, to relieve some of your mental pressure.

I didn't understand what death was when I was a kid because my parents avoided the topic. I was 10 and couldn't grasp that my letters to my grandma wouldn't be read anymore. They wouldn't explain that her cancer was final for her. They just told me she's healthy enough to jog.

Tell your dad's parents, or even your mom's, if they're still around.\n\nAnd, if you have the time or energy for it, sit down with your sister and tell her gently what death is and how a funeral ends. Yes, everyone cries and says good things about the dead person. But then the dead person is placed in a box in the ground and we don't get to see them EVER AGAIN. And THAT'S why people are crying. Because someone we love went away very far from us and we can't see them anymore. Not even phones can reach them.

His name was Orlando and we would put him in a shoebox and cover the shoebox with a blanket to \u201cbury\u201d him.\n\nI tell this story because, to me, that is a reasonable way for young kids to play \u201cfuneral\u201d and conceptualize death. It is natural for your sister to be curious and ask questions. I think acting out her own funeral once is even understandable. It could be her way of reassuring herself that people would be sad and miss her if she died. Playing it over and over is excessive. It has become a game at this point, most likely, and a way for her to get attention. If she is genuinely distressed or fearful about death, then that needs to be addressed with her. You should not be expected to play this funeral game with her no matter what, ESPECIALLY after what you have been through.\n\nIs anyone making sure you are okay? Are your dad and stepmother taking care of your needs? If your sister is genuinely distressed, that needs to be dealt with. But that should not overshadow what you need. \n\nI am very sorry for your loss.", "your stepmom is into some hippie new age bullshit. oh negative energy. I would ignore anything she says or does. Ignore the half sister. she doesn't know any better.", "NTA\nYour stepmother is pretty much teaching your sister that funerals are a game.", "NTA your step mom sounds like a sick sick woman and she needs to get her kid in check asap. What\u2019s happening there is NOT NORMAL", "NTA.\n\nThis is far from normal behaviour, though it started out fine. My daughter has played with her toys losing people, or pretended to be an orphan, (Last time she said she was a little girl whose parents had died that we had bought from a store we had just been to!) She doesn't fixate on it the way your sister has.\n\nYour stepmother is the reason this has gotten out of hand. She's the one encouraging your sister, and your Dad isn't doing anything to help. I don't think a serious chat with either of them is going to do anything, but your sister is different.\n\nMaybe you can try to redirect her play? You said she found a cardboard box? That's a brilliant prop right there. Tell her you want to play with her, not think about how it would feel if you lost her. Encourage her to play in a healing way. Maybe that box can become a coffee shop counter, or a special den just for the two of you, or a ship that you can ride to the stars to help you feel better? \n\nI am so sorry that you are going through this. You suffered a huge loss, an injury, and the supposedly responsible adults are refusing to let you heal. As much as I want to tell you to go to an adult you can trust, you've made it pretty clear that you don't have one. The best I can do is suggest ways to try and change things yourself. I hope some of this helps in some small way.", "NTA\n\nEnergy... flow... ???\n\nThis woman is nuttier than squirrel turds, and is very likely trying to push you out of the house, so she can play happy family with your dad and *her* kid. This will get worse, not better. Talk to your aunt and uncle. Talk to your dad. Your best bet is to find alternative living arrangements until you're ready to live on your own, so start planning yesterday.", "NTA. Something is wrong with your stepmom and stepsister.", "NTA. Maybe try being honest with your sister, in a child-appropriate way. \"When you play the funeral game, I feel sad, because it reminds me that my cousin is gone. I don't like to play it. Do you understand?\" Maybe she'll have more emotional awareness than Annabel.\n\nIf that goes well, you could try other aspects: \"I am still very sad now, so sometimes I don't want to play or talk. During these times, you can help me by giving me time to be alone.\"\n\"If you have questions about death or funerals, you can ask your mom/dad.\"\n\"If you want to hear good things about yourself, we can do that without playing funeral. I'll say something I like about you and then you say one about me.\"\n\nOf course, all of this is only if you are up for it. You went through a lot. Maybe you want to talk to a therapist? Or a counselor at school? Best wishes!", "Eeew, no, sweetie. You're NTA and you CERTAINLY don't need to \"toughen up.\" You've been through some fairly serious trauma for someone so young. For anyone, honestly.  Please talk to your dad about grief counseling, and make sure you're getting help for what could possibly develop into a serious case of survivors guilt.\n\nI'm glad you weren't hurt worse,  and I'm so very sorry for your loss.", "Omg. NTA. What does your father say about this? You've gone through a very traumatic loss and you need to heal.  Your sister needs to speak to a professional. This is an obsession.", "NTA\n\nThis is not grief.\n\nShe is playing a game that is NOT FUNNY.\n\nStop indulging them. If they want to continue for the sake of little sister. Fine let them. You do not and are not obligated to participate.", "OMG NTA  \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA Nobody has the right to make you sacrifice your feelings for a child's fun. Stop doing it. Now. You could be causing yourself and the girl more damage than you're aware of. You don't deserve this.\n\nBelieve what your aunt and uncle say. If their close adults you can trust, confide in them. Tell them that you're sorry, you know they're grieving, but you need help and have no one else to turn to. Tell them what's going on and that you don't know how to say No. See how things proceed from there.", "NTA, I get wanting a small child not to fear death, but she is also old enough to learn that her method of play is upsetting you. And honestly, her play isn\u2019t about death, it\u2019s about hearing nice things about herself.", "NTA. I don't think it's totally out of the ordinary to have your little sister be playing these death games; she's just old enough to understand that and play is how kids work through ideas and concepts. However, there is no reason for you to have to be involved in any of this.  Your family needs to be supportive of your trauma, not just your sister's understanding of it. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA... This child is getting attention, that's why she's doing it. She needs to be told to stop. There are certain behaviors in this world that are not acceptable or appropriate. In this case, in your house, at this time, this is one of them. \n\nI cannot even imagine the pain this is causing you. Your MIL and father need to put a stop to it to protect you. This is ridiculous.\n\nI'm terribly sorry for the losses you have suffered through. I also have a lot of feelings of guilt from the recent death of a young loved one and I understand the non-stop pain. Hugs.", "You need to tell your other family members what\u2019s going on!

Playing along with this is NOT part of being an older sibling. It is cruel to make you join in. Your dad and his wife are insensitive AH. \n\nPlease tell your aunt and uncle what is happening and spend time with them. It's very likely that seeing you would comfort them.", "Do you have a guidance counselor at school or someone you can talk to?", "Today she found a box she can lie in to be her casket.

This is what makes you strong.", "Well you\u2019re right I am pretty negative right now.", "Yeah it\u2019s just cold and wet and most things are closed because it\u2019s Christmas. My dad says I don\u2019t need therapy.", "My best friend was my cousin. It feels weird being around our other friends right now as they look at me like I\u2019m the Grim Reaper.

Stacey is having her first experience with death and that's difficult for a 6 year old ... but Annabel is a grown ass adult who should understand that your real, recent, and traumatic grief is more important than Stacey's play-funerals. Your stepmother is just being cruel.", "And your sister is old enough to understand the word \"no\" -- say it to her again over and over. You do not have to participate in this horrendous playacting.\n\nOP -- NTA. I really hope your Dad realizes the damage he is causing you. Does your school offer any form of counseling or someone to talk to there? I would reach out as soon as you get back in school. Until then, say no. Everyone else is going to have to deal with hearing the word that you are allowed to say.", "NTA This is absolutely attention seeking behavior,  Annabelle is just reinforcing it", "Your father is mistaken. He's putting her happiness above your own. And she certainly does not know best\u2014she sounds like a loon, to be frank.\n\nThis is not your burden to bear.", "What about wanting YOU to be happy? Does he not care about you, too?", "Your happiness matters too though.", "He is wrong wrong wrong wrong. As a dad he needs to protect his child. He is failing miserably.", "In the long run its bad for both you and your sister. They are basically telling you that you are not allowed to have feelings or be deserving of respect. And they are telling your sister that it is ok to be the center of attention no matter it takes to be there.", "Darling One, if they're asking you to come around,  do so. If they're asking you to come around,  they don't need SPACE, they need YOU. And it sounds like you need them.", "Could you maybe let them know what is going on so they could support you and maybe help you get out of the house?", "Oh -- I'm really sorry.  I meant stepmom/dad's wife.", "Is there an adult you can turn to about this stuff? Other relatives, a teacher or a guidance counselor? You're an adolescent that went through an extremely traumatic event\u2014you absolutely should be in therapy right now and it's horrific your father is denying you of that.", "Oh honey... I wish I could take you in and give you a safe space to grieve in. You have been through so much and you are not getting the support you need. Death and grief are so traumatic and you need a safe person to hug and cry and talk with. I'm so sorry for your losses. I wish I could support you somehow. Please please please find a safe person. I lost a son a year and a half ago and not a day goes by I don't feel the pain and guilt. You need to know your feelings are valid and be able to talk though them cuz none of it is fair and none of it makes sense and all of it hurts.

Cause he sure ain't doing it now.", "I am so sorry, I don't know what else to say.", "It\u2019s pretty messed up that your stepmother is chastising you for \u2018creating a negative atmosphere\u2019 imo. She doesn\u2019t care at all that they are making the atmosphere at home negative for you, it\u2019s all about them. She sounds like a hypocrite and a lunatic frankly.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. You are allowed to feel \u2018negative\u2019, a horrible thing happened in your life and that sucks.", "Maybe find something to get you out of the house. Pick up a hobby, do an extracurricular activity and/or get a part time job.", "If your stepsister has a set bedtime, try staying out (cafe, bookstore, library, etc) until then if you can.  A few nights in a hotel is not the worst idea, but it would dip into your savings which is unfortunate.", "My dad knows. He just wants Annabel to be happy. The other adults I would normally talk to are grieving so this seems like something I have to shoulder myself.

It\u2019s tough now as she just doesn\u2019t let up even for 5 minutes", "Grief is exhausting, sometimes all you can do is rest. Op should have a safe place at home and not have to leave the house and get a job to find peace. This death is very recent.", "That\u2019s because he wants his young wife happy. She was in her early 20s and he was in his early 40s when they got together.", "Darling please talk to the other adults you usually talk to. This is not normal, or acceptable. \n\nIf you tell the other adults you usually talk to, one of them will sharply pull your stepmum into line, which is what she needs. \n\nOne idea which you might find helpful right now is the circle of grief. When something bad happens to someone, they are at the centre of the circle of support for grief - whether that\u2019s the death of a partner, or best friend, or parent, or child; or if its a diagnosis like cancer. Around them are their friends and family, people not directly and immediately affected. Around those people are less close friends, work friends etc and so on outwards into colleagues at work, teachers at school etc etc.\n\nThe idea of the circle of grief is that you *dump out* and *support in*. The person at the centre gets the most support, and they are able to vent to the people around them. In turn,those people support the person at the centre, and they turn to people further out in the circle for support and to dump their emotions. *They don\u2019t dump in onto the person who is suffering.*\n\nYou and your Auntie and Uncle are all at the centre here. You were there when your cousin and best friend died, and their child has died. So now your stepmum, your Dad, and even your little sister are *supposed to support you.* Not the other way around. \n\nIts not your job to help your little sister. Its your family\u2019s job to help **you**.  \n\nIts *not* about being a big brother - its about your family supporting **you** at the centre of the circle of grief. Your needs should come first, not your little sister\u2019s. \n\nYour stepmother is being incredibly unsupportive, thoughtless and unkind for making you relive the death and funeral of your best friend over and over again. Which is what she\u2019s doing. \n\nPlease tell your Auntie and Uncle what is going on here - you do not have to shoulder this yourself, at all. This is something that an adult can, and should, fix really quickly. Give me 3 minutes with your stepmom, love.  I\u2019ll straighten out her energy flows for her. \n\nAlso you mentioned that they\u2019ve invited you over, and said they don\u2019t blame you, but you feel that they probably don\u2019t want to see you now ? Go over there if they ask you. \n\nA house that had two teenage boys rumbling around inside it will be very quiet with no teenage boys at all. It sounds like you spent almost as much time there with your cousin as you did at home. Go see them if that\u2019s what they want. Go talk to them. If I were them, I\u2019d want to know that you were being put through this rubbish, on top of losing your best friend.", "when your father tells you that he wants Annabel happy, has he mentioned anything about your happiness or wellbeing? If not, approach him again and ask directly if he cares about your happiness & wellbeing or if he believes that ensuring Annabel's happiness matters even when it comes at the cost of your happiness & well being. His wife is helping her daughter fetishize death, and is demanding that you not only participate in this activity but that you engage in an activity that is harmful to your mental health", "Of course. Dad married someone who is closer to age of his teenage son than himself. He would do anything to keep his middle-age trophy happy, including traumatising his son and making his daughter as unhinged as her mum. I will be banned for this comment, but so ef be it.", "Yeah she taught something that wasn\u2019t yoga but was similar I can\u2019t remember. It was a big age gap. Her mom is the same age as Dad.", "I will think about my aunt and uncle it\u2019s just we look kind of similar like more like brothers and it is freaking me out a bit right now when I catch myself in the mirror and it must be way worse for them so I don\u2019t know. Thank you though this comment was very thoughtful.", "Never assume what others think or feel. \n\nThe other side of that thought is that your aunt and uncle may take comfort in being with someone who loved their son. \n\nTalk to them."]}
