My aunt and uncle are devastated although they have said a bunch of times it wasn\u2019t my fault. \n\nHe was my cousin on my late mom\u2019s side and Stacey only met him a couple of times in passing.\n\nMy sister has been kind of fascinated by what happened to Dallie. She had never been to a funeral before. It started pretty much straight afterwards with her having funerals for her toys. \n\nThen a few weeks ago she started having funerals for herself. She lies down and says she\u2019s died and then Annabel says we have to dress nicely and come say nice things about Stacey. So she lies there while Annabel cries about how much she will miss her and then when we\u2019ve said enough nice things Stacey gets up and says she\u2019s alive and it\u2019s over for another few hours. Yesterday she did this 3 times.\n\nI can\u2019t take much more of this.\n\nAnnabel says that Stacey is conceptualising mortality for the first time and doing it in an incredibly creative way and I need to be supportive. She says I already conceptualised it when my own mom died and I need to be less selfish. She says my negative flow is disrupting the energy of the house and I should go stay somewhere else if I can\u2019t contribute positively to the family dynamic.\n\nI would like to be anywhere else but the only places I could go are my grandparents (mom\u2019s side) who live in a retirement community and are very old and sick and my aunt and uncle and although they say they don\u2019t blame me and they love me I don\u2019t think they should have to be around me that much right now.

She's playing a new game because her mother is positively reinforcing her to do it. Your stepmother is  being incredibly insensitive.", "Sounds like your sister is enjoying the attention more than anything else. Since her mother is of no help, is it possible for you and your dad to redirect your sister towards a different outlet?\n\nYou could also be age appropriately frank with your sister and let her know that this is hurting your feelings. Don't shame her or tell her it's wrong. Just be honest. This is a great moment to teach your sister sympathy that her mother is missing out on.", "NTA\n\nMortality is a thing that children do get exposed to, there are lots of questions, each child processes it in different ways. Parents need to answer the child's curiosity and questions patiently, without it becoming a significant mainstay of the childs daily life.\n\nAnnabel needs to help their child process the concept of mortality, but 3 make believe funerals in 1 day are indicators that this is over indulgence. Insisting that you participate too every time Stacy wants one, is asking too much.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry you're being pressured to participate. Sounds like her Mom is egging her on. It isn't on you to go to a fake funeral 3x a day. \n\nI wonder if you can explain to her that you'd rather play something else or tell her that people only get one funeral so you're only going one more time, something like that.\n\nGood luck OP, sounds like her Mom isn't going to be super helpful (and honestly, she's the AH for suggesting you need to move out for not attending multiple fake daily funerals)\n\nYou sound like a very thoughtful person and I hope this sorts itself for you.", "NTA.  Your feelings are what they are.  Not much to do about them.  Maybe you could get lost when the games are going on.  Whatever you decide to do is what you should do, except create a negative atmosphere for those around you.", "Definitely NTA. You are still grieving as well as dealing with the guilt you carry. Annabel is definitely way out of line for her comments, but try not to be too angry at your sister she's a child who doesn't understand just yet  speak to your father see if he can help the situation", "NTA. Annabelle is welcome to parent Stacey on mortality, but not at your emotional expense. It sounds like this accident was very traumatic for you, and you need to be allowed to grieve and recover and NOT participate in triggering events. Be firm and polite and tell her for your own emotional well being, no you have participated in enough funerals for your age. I\u2019m so sorry.", "Nta. It\u2019s true that your little sister\u2019s behavior is normal. She\u2019s learning about death in the way most children do, which is through pretend play. It can help her to understand and process the information. However, your feelings matter just as much as hers or anyone else\u2019s. It\u2019s incredibly wrong for your stepmother to shame you and tell you to either participate or be sent away. Please speak to your dad about this and what it does to your mental health. You have every right to avoid the \u201cpretend play\u201d without being chastised. You also really need to seek out grief counseling. You also need to be able to process your feelings about what happened. I can see how much guilt you feel and hope you\u2019ll seek counseling, it will help you so much to move past those feelings and process your grief. If your dad will not have your back, then please speak with your grandparents or your aunt and uncle. They may be grieving, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with the 3 of your grieving together. It may even encourage them to go to grief counseling as well.", "NTA. go talk to your dad about this. stacey needs support but you also need support as a young person who's had more than once serious trauma growing up. if people around you aren't willing to or able to help easing the pain you're feeling, you should seek a professional who can listen to you and help you. hope it's all gonna be better for you.", "Nobody should try to put a label or an esxpiration date on anybody else's griev. It's barely a month since the accident, it's ok not to be ok even if \"all\" you have is a broken arm. The wounds that hurts us the most are not always physical. I say NTA, but it would be good if you talk to your dad wife and your dad about how you're feeling and dealing with your sister process, learning conceptualising about mortality it's also learn about the impact of it on the ones that are alive.", "NTA. One fake funeral should've been enough but you shouldn't have had to participate in that, you're still a child yourself. 3 in one day just makes me feel she is attention seeking.", "NTA, and it's time your father and stepmum put a stop to this. It's on for your sister to have been fascinated with this and played it out in a child's way to deal with it, but you lost your mum, you lost your cousin, you definitily suffered enough trauma.", "NTA. \n\nYou're obviously processing some trauma around the loss of your cousin and that's not the same as losing your mother at a young age. You have different feelings around this than you did when you lost your mother, and your step mother is not letting you have the support you need to process and grieve. \n\nYour sister may well be processing death and funerals in a creative way, but that doesn't mean you have to support or participate in that, and her mother should not try to force you to. She needs to respect your grief and trauma, and not force you to participate in something that is holding you back.\n\nHave you spoken to your dad about what is happening and how you feel? Can he speak to your step mother on your behalf?", "It's all normal behavior and your step mom is right that you should tolerate it, but she's wrong that you have to participate.\n\nI'd give staying with your aunt and uncle a try. If you want to, you can tell them about what your sister is doing and how sad it makes you. They will understand. They might talk to your parents about treating you better.\n\nIf nothing else works for you, and the kid won't stop, sit her down and tell her that death is a one time thing. There are lots of children's books out there that help illustrate what death means in an age appropriate way. Tell her everyone only gets one funeral, so you will only go to one (more) funeral. After that, if she wants you at another funeral, you will be in the hospital (your bedroom) and you will send a teddy bear in your place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's a lot for anyone to handle. Especially at your age. For her to prioritize your sister because she doesn't understand mortality yet is ridiculous. I assume your sister is fine but if she's having trouble with the idea of death that's not your responsibility.

Anabel should be shielding you from Stacey's processing of mortality. not insisting you exacerbate your grief and loss by dealing with these play \"funerals\".   \n\n\nHonestly. I'd show Anabel this thread.  She sounds like she genuinely doesn't realise \\*you\\* are dealing with a huge loss in your life, not \"processing mortality\" but grieving, and you need to be able to grieve, not be tormented by the play of a child, however innocent that play.", "NTA.\n\nWhat your sister is doing is normal play and figuring out something in life adapted to that play.  It's kinda weird that she does it over and over, but young kids do play the same tea parties over and over.....\n\nHowever, you don't necessarily have to participate in it.  You can excuse yourself.  You have mental anguish over the accident too, you are entitled to find your space to grieve and recover from it and not be reminded of it over and over and over by a 6 year old doing her thing.", "NTA   I'm so sorry for your loss and what you're going through and the fact that your stepmother is compounding it by being a totally insensitive AH.\n\nI think what your sister is doing is partially processing and figuring out death, but also playing to a very warm gallery.  Her mother was right to allow her to do this a few times, but multiple times per day for days on end is a bit much.  And to force you to participate when you're injured and grieving a traumatic loss is a pure AH move.  \n\nFor her to then double down by implying you should find other housing is just beyond the pale.

Are there any bereavement groups for teenagers locally? I really think you need to find a place to talk about your feelings, long term this is going to be a difficult period to traverse,  and the sooner you get on the journey of exploring your own grief the better handle you will have on it. \n\nPlease look for the support you need. \n\nX", "NTA.  Your stepmom is being totally unreasonable.  It may be normal for your sister to put on these play funerals.  However, it would be very easy, and REASONABLE, for your mom to explain to her that you are very, very sad about your cousin, so you don't want to participate.   I think that's what almost any of us here would do.  \n\nIt's also bizarre that she wants you to leave because it makes you uncomfortable.  Where is your dad?  Is he around?  Can he talk some sense into her about this?\n\nIt'd be nice if you could get away from this, if only for a while.  Do you have a close friend whose parents you could confide in?  I think they'd appreciate how bizarre and uncomfortable this is for you.  Maybe they'd let you stay at their place, if only for a weekend, to relieve some of your mental pressure. Also, if your dad won't talk to his wife about this, maybe an older mom could talk some sense into her.", "NTA, you are grieving, which your stepmother needs to also respect. You can explain to her and your sister that it is hard for you, and that it reminds you of the pain of losing you cousin. It is ok for her to play like that, but your stepmom has to respect your boundaries and not make you participate.", "INFO. What do you say/do when told to participate in the funeral?  Everyone is saying not the asshole and I'm inclined to agree, but I'm not sure because you haven't described your reaction or response.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\n\nTell Annabel that it is too soon after the accident and the very real funeral of your cousin for you to be participating in pretend funerals of your very much alive half sister, and that if she has any respect for your grief she will no longer ask you to participate.\n\nI\u2019m SO SO SORRY that she said what she did about your \u2018negative flow\u2019.

I didn't understand what death was when I was a kid because my parents avoided the topic. I was 10 and couldn't grasp that my letters to my grandma wouldn't be read anymore. They wouldn't explain that her cancer was final for her. They just told me she's healthy enough to jog. So please  let your sister explore and learn.\n\nIf you don't want to participate your parents will just have to understand that you're grieving for your cousin. I would honestly brush it off as they aren't being supportive of how you lost someone.", "NTA. Your parents saying to stay somewhere else although they know you cannot is BS.

Is she the kind of step mother who emphasizes that Stacey is your half sister, not your sister?\n\nI think you should try to participate, but it\u2019s fine to limit it. It\u2019s also healthy for Stacey to have boundaries, like \u201cI don\u2019t want to play that right now\u201d.

Sounds like emotional abuse disguised as \u2018conceptual role play\u2019 and you shouldn\u2019t have to be exposed to it. \n\nYou need an advocate in the form of an adult who can express the unnecessary nature of continuing to role play and that would best be served by your father. Why hasn\u2019t stepped in to mitigate this? Surly he knows you\u2019ve experienced trauma by losing someone close to you. \n\nYou\u2019re going through a lot of emotional issues but unless it\u2019s clearly expressed, the role play of a child will over ride the emotional well being of a teen who lost someone close.", "You are absolutely NTA. My heart goes out to you. Not only are you grieving, it sounds like you're suffering survivor guilt too. \n\nStacey may be conceptualising death but that's not your responsibility, and it's horrible unfair of Annabel to expect you to join in with this. I cannot understand why she has no empathy towards how this must make you feel. \n\nPlease listen to your aunt and uncle, and go stay there if you need to. They're not blaming you, and maybe a supportive household in a place of love is exactly what you and they need right now.", "Your parents are allowing you to be retraumatized over and over again.

Annabelle's reaction is weird and OTT.", "NTA  Pretend funerals are a very normal phase for kids to go through, there's nothing particularly weird about it.

The reason she's doing it so frequently is because she's getting positive attention and viewing the funeral aspect as a game with no real thought of the \"death\" part. \n\nAnd letting her do it THIS often without having a real, child friendly, conversation about it is doing your stepsister a disservice. \n\nNot to mention how it's affecting you.\n\nYour stepmother is okay with it because stepsister is her little angel. You dad is okay with it because he doesn't want a fight with stepmother and, more importantly, it's not hurting HIM.\n\nSo, talk to someone outside of their really stupid echo chamber. Tell your dad's parents, or even your mom's, if they're still around.\n\nAnd, if you have the time or energy for it, sit down with your sister and tell her gently what death is and how a funeral ends. Yes, everyone cries and says good things about the dead person. But then the dead person is placed in a box in the ground and we don't get to see them EVER AGAIN. And THAT'S why people are crying. Because someone we love went away very far from us and we can't see them anymore. Not even phones can reach them.
