Me and Lauren have been together for 2 years and I am estranged from my birth mother and sister. My dad is remarried to my step mom. I\u2019ve known her for about 10 years and love her. My parents divorced when I was 15 due to my mother fucking around on my dad. I cut contact after the divorce. Long story is my sister doesn\u2019t agree with my decisions regarding our mom so we don\u2019t speak. Deb (Lauren\u2019s mom) is controlling over her kids and thinks she is some sort of \u201clife coach\u201d but has 0 credentials. She\u2019s an absolute moron and tries to \u201cfix\u201d everyone around her. \n\nI asked Lauren\u2019s dad for permission which pissed off deb. Lauren parents are separated. Around then deb started saying how I need to mend bridges with my family. I told her I was perfectly happy with my family as is. She attempted to set up a therapy session with my sister, mom and myself whenever she found out I planed for my stepmom to do all the wedding activities because my mom wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nI found out. Blew a gasket. Blocked my sister, deb and uninvited my sister from our wedding. The wedding was canceled. But we came back together with the deal that her mother is limited in our lives.\n\nI do not speak to deb unless I\u2019m forced to. But I blew up a week ago and this lead to the post here. During the planning process deb commented on things and I told her that we didn\u2019t need opinions. She said my \u201cattitude\u201d is problematic. I told Lauren my stepmom would be covering the flowers, cake and table settings as her gift. Deb scoffed and said that was inappropriate for someone\u2019s stepmom to do. I said\u2026 \u201cyou know what deb. She is actually paying for something unlike you. So maybe shut up for once?\u201d.  Lauren got involved and told her mom to stay out of it. And then deb said something like \u201cthat anger is why I tried setting up that therapy session\u201d. I said \u201cthe reason you tried setting up that therapy session is because you are a lonely, crazy, bored C**T with nothing else to do. You aren\u2019t giving us shit for this other than your mouth. You couldn\u2019t even afford a table setting because you have no job or money. You\u2019re still living in your husbands house because you couldn\u2019t afford your own. Maybe you should work on coaching up your own life\u201d. I then said she should work on mending her fences. And I called her ex and handed her the phone. Which she threw on the ground and left after. Lauren is saying that her mom was wrong but I went too far calling her dad knowing what her mom supposedly went thru. I said it\u2019s no different than what deb did. Deb has since texted Lauren calling my stepmom is a bitch (something my sister says).

He also claimed Lauren would be embarrassed if they returned the stepmother's money to her since Deb found it inappropriate for her cover some of the wedding costs.  If she would be embarrassed by that, I imagine she would be embarrassed by a broken engagement and a called-off wedding.  Even if that's not the case, he's still emotionally manipulating his fiancee.\n\nOP and Lauren don't have children so it's a moot point at this time as to whether Deb might try to facilitate any meeting with his mom and sister.

Including continuing to limit contact. \n\n> I imagine she would be embarrassed by a broken engagement and a called-off wedding\n\nThat's on her. She has a choice, accept a rational healthy boundary or not. \n\nThe MILs actions require such a boundary, even though their are no children involved yet, since discussing views on children and parenting is vital before marriage, yes its extremely important to be upfront about that. \n\nClearly set boundaries are not manipulative.", "Direct Quote - \"I said then we can return my stepmoms money to her given that the mother of the bride finds her money inappropriate.

Huge difference.\n\nReally? Let's see, according to the OP she is controlling if her children's lives. Constantly inserting her opinion and attempting to manipulate situations to her satisfaction. That's way more than \"busy body.\" \nSo let's see what OP did wrong....\n\n>I asked Lauren\u2019s dad for permission which pissed off deb. Lauren parents are separated.\n\nEhhh, somewhat traditional, not my cup of tea, but as long as Lauren was consulted and wanted him too, that's all that matters, really. \n\n>Around then deb started saying how I need to mend bridges with my family.

Or your judgements questioned. \n\n>I found out. Blew a gasket. Blocked my sister, deb and uninvited my sister from our wedding. The wedding was canceled. But we came back together with the deal that her mother is limited in our lives.\n\nI'm glad he found out. \n\nDo you see what I see? *The wedding WAS canceled* \nThat tells me that Lauren must have sided with her mother at some point or felt \"it wasn't really that wrong, she meant well\" which is a common excuse children raised by controlling parents give. In any case, Lauren list his trust. \n\n>But we came back together with the deal that her mother is limited in our lives.\n\nThis is when the boundaries were set. That's not manipulative. The wedding was canceled, he gave his boundaries for reconciliation and moving forward with the wedding. \n\nThat's called communication. OP communicated the amount of contact he is comfortable having with his future MIL if he were to be married, after the MIL stomped on a boundary of his. \n\n>Setting expectations prior to getting married is fine. No problems there. \nAnd that's exactly what he did. He does not want her mother to have an active part in their life going forward. \n\n>OP has, in effect, said to his fiancee, \"You do what I want, the way I want, about who I want or this is a done deal.\" I find that manipulative.\n\nWhen did he say anything close to that??? He offered to return a gift that offended her mother. His boundaries concern her mother and mother alone. Which makes perfect sense since her mother stomped on his pre-existing boundaries. \n\nI don't think you understand boundaries. Or reconciliation after trust has been lost. \n\nLet's look at it another way. Another issue that causes a loss of trust in a relationship is cheating. Pretend that Lauren made a mistake and had a ONS with a friend. Op finds out cancels the wedding and they work it out. Op says that in order to move forward with the wedding she must completely cut off the friend and cannot even see him in a group setting and he will not be invited to the wedding. According to your take, that's manipulative. \n\n>It appears, though, OP has no problems cutting off contact with people around him, women especially, who don't perform to his standards.\n\nLol, are you the OPs mother or sister? \n\nOPs mother cheated on his dad. OP was 15, clearly old enough to form his own opinion. He is not the first child or the last to tale that type of stand in a divorce.\n\nHe did not cut his sister out until she participated in crossing his boundaries with Deb. \n\nThis entire situation in the post came about because he was DEFENDING HIS STEPMOTHERS INVOLVEMENT. \n\nOP doesn't have a problem with women. He has a problem with toxic people who stomp boundaries to get their way.", ">It appears, though, OP has no problems cutting off contact with people around him, women especially, who don't perform to his standards.\n\nNTA, OP \n\nSome people have different standards on what's acceptable conduct, and that's okay. \n\nNot everything or everyone is meant for everybody.", "'But we came back together with the deal that her mother is limited in our lives'\n\n'I told her we didn't need her opinion on things'\n\n'Gonna push deb out slowly.
