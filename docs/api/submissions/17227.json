Yet she never treated me like a daughter. My father and her used to treat me like I was a b*tch. They hated my mother and still do like to talk bad about her to this day. (I don\u2019t have the best relationship with my mother but she is in fact still my mother)\n\nI wasn\u2019t invited to my dad and stepmoms wedding which made me feel left out as a kid, I never met her parents or her one brother until her mother was dying and I was in my 20\u2019s. My dad stopped taking us on family trips but he would travel across the country with her. As I kid, I despised her. They had a two bedroom apartment and it was always her home we were just allowed to live in on the weekends. She never made a room just for us as kids.\n\nBy the time I was a teenager I stopped going. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable and/or welcome. My dad and her would nag me and tell me my clothes or hair were messy and I just honestly hated her. I was raised to respect her because she is my fathers wife.\n\nFast forward into my adult life - when I first met my now husband, she told him he made me a better person. She makes a lot of comments I find degrading but I don\u2019t make a big deal. She also constantly brings up a lot of my childhood trauma constantly to this day. She\u2019s negative and she has never done one motherly thing for me. She tried to do nice things in her own way but that doesn\u2019t make her someone I idolize as a mother. Just the other day my dad tried to tell me she\u2019s been more of a mother to me than my own mother which couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. My aunt who passed away was like a mom to me, my grandmothers helped raise me, not my step-mom.\n\nHer birthday is a week after Mother\u2019s Day and I plan to send a gift for that. I have never wished her a happy Mother\u2019s Day my whole life and now my dad is trying to argue that I should. To me, it seems crazy and illogical. She is more of a friend that I had no choice but to be friends with. As a kid, she never did things that made me feel special or mothered. It\u2019s frustrating because I feel I deserve boundaries as a grown woman\u2026", "created_utc": 1684066928, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hatie/aita_i_dont_want_to_wish_my_stepmom_a_happy/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was a shitty stepmother so why would you want to celebrate her on Mothers Day?\n\nDon't back down.

I text happy mother's day to not just my mom, but all my friends, say it to co-workers, even post it on social media.  It costs nothing to take 2 seconds to copy a text, and saves so much time and energy arguing.  If you were no contact, I'd say you're clear.  But you said you plan to text her next week for birthday.... which is it?", "NTA. She didn't treat you like a daughter therefore she or your father can not make you wish her a happy mother's day.\n\nYou are being way too kind to them, I think that's why they have the face to ask.", "NTA. After reading all that I feel they don't deserve to have you in their lives. After treating you like so, you'd be better of cutting the bridges with them. Good luck with the future (sorry for eventual grammar error, English isn't my native language)", "NTA she's not your mother, you aren't close to her, she's a miserable person...", "NTA, but why do you let them have the opportunity to degrade you? Why do you keep going back to the mental abuse? They seem to love the reaction you have from getting riled up.\n\nI strongly suggest going low contact if you haven't, and setting hard boundaries. F the advice that you only get one dad. You can choose to surround yourself with people who like you and call them family.", "NTA", "NTA, and I can't believe you even bother with a birthday gift. A card is more than she deserves. Dad can make it up to her.", "You deserve boundaries but you must be the one who sets and enforces them. You aren't required to have a relationship with your dad's wife in any capacity. You don't have to wish her happy birthday, mother's day, flag day, any day really. Why are you still in contact with either of them. Support the ones who showed up for you when you needed them most, who heard your cries when they were the quietest, who cheered you on when you didn't think you could do it, and all points in between. If she wasn't that person in your life it's perfectly acceptable to stay silent towards her on this day and all other days that follow. NTA.", "So luckily they have no other kids. I was 9, I was invited to my moms when she was remarried which made me happy as a kid. They decided a courthouse wedding and no kids were included in the after party.. including me and my brother", "I guess you only get one dad - and I\u2019ve always focused on a sole relationship with him. But he is a piece of work. It\u2019s making me realize I have to establish boundaries - he actually threatened my whole side of his family \u201cmay start to think differently of me\u201d which they did all turn their backs on me when I stopped visiting him as a teenager\u2026\nAlso, I never called his house phone\u2026 still to this day I only call his cell phone to talk to him. But recently my grandmother died and now she\u2019s trying to get him to guilt trip me on so many different things and it\u2019s so frustrating.

It\u2019s messed up\u2026\u2026", "I\u2019ve always really respected my father so I never wanted to overstep the boundaries as a child (also what I was taught by both my grandmothers - basically his wife was priority and I had to get used to it) & now as an adult, we mutually respect each other but.I have a hard time tolerating certain things and am learning to put up those boundaries. Then this happened recently\u2026 It\u2019s hard & That is the problem. I\u2019m a people pleaser and I don\u2019t want to be anymore\u2026.

Don\u2019t want to be anymore\u2026", "I guess despite what my dad has put me through, he still means a lot to me. But these recent guilt trips are triggering me back to my childhood where I was often emotionally/verbally abused", "Well I wish my friends and mothers happy Mother\u2019s Day. She was in a group text and already thinks I\u2019ve wished her a happy Mother\u2019s Day but I agree with the reply. It is a personal boundary. She\u2019s had a lot of chances to be a mother figure to me and she treated me like garbage and still thinks she can gossip and control certain aspects of my life. Clearly with the relationship with my dad. She has ruined so much over the years. I think she\u2019s lucky I\u2019m nice to her at all. I agree it would avoid the arguments which is what I hate", "The issue seems to be op has a personal boundary and feels that historically her step mom is absolutely not motherly. She also had an impaired relationship with her bio mom it sounds like? So 'happy mother's day' makes her uncomfortable. Being asked (by her dad) to let down her personal boundary is unfair in my opinion. I would compare the situation to telling someone 'it hurts my feelings and it just takes two seconds to say merry Christmas', after they've made it clear that they don't celebrate Christmas.\n\nNTA", "Also make your boundaries clear by calling her your father's wife - and not your stepmother.\n\nThe way she treated you she doesn't deserve to be called a stepmother. You can only become a stepmother to someone you have a parent child relationship with, and not by marrying a man with children.\n\nYou self compared your relationship with her as forced. He wasn't even a motherly friend to you.\n\nNo way you are responsible to improve her melancholy. - Your father is asking to much and aromatizes the past in favor of his wife without acknowledging your feelings. \n\nAfter all they can be lucky that you are still in contact with them and will even sent her a birthday present.", "I definitely believe you have PTSD.   Poor thing.   You are NTA at all.", "Low contact.", "Hate to you hit with reality-check but definitely need that epiphany - How is it isolation when when only 2 people you're cutting off haven't treated you as part of their respective family since you were 9? Meanwhile the family that do love you & want to be around you such as your mother, stepfather, your husband, etc are tired of you being mistreated & putting in effort in 2 people that will never treated with basic courtesy of being a daughter but want all Kodak milestone moments to brag to others as if they love you when clearly don't at all - drop the rope already, you don't owe either of them a relationship nor a hello now. \n\nConsider this Mother's Day your spring cleaning by getting rid of trash (sperm donor & his wife) & enjoying along with appreciating your true mothers (your mom, your aunt & grandmother).", "Thanks for the support \ud83d\ude4f", "Clearly that\u2019s what I think I need to do."]}
