Not the other way around. You send one message/one email and then wait. Either you get a response or you don't. I find it odd that your nephew did not know much either.

She\u2019s never called me, never sent me a gift or card, never emailed me.  When I\u2019m there, she acts like I\u2019m not there.

You were a child, your father's behavior wasn't your fault or theirs, but they basically treated you like it was your job to make it up to them for how they were treated by him. Especially when you clearly understand what he did was wrong and tried your hardest to be there for them prior to that.\n\nYour SIL is a piece of work--that kind of behavior is manipulative, \"oh, you better, come, never mind, he's dead, no he's not\". She was trying to see how fast you would respond. Avoiding the manipulative SIL and your mother was plenty good reason, avoiding the siblings who used you but wouldn't support you was plenty good reason. But this just clinches it. I know your niece must be grieving, but she isn't any better because she expects you to put yourself in an untenable position.", "NTA- did u ever find out why SIL made that memorial post while he was still alive?", "NTA but this is a sad story for all of you. I\u2019m sorry", "NTA", "\"Two hours later, she called me back to say my brother wasn\u2019t dead (and no one has any idea why SIL posted what she did).\"\n\nInteresting story.  My brother and niece had to rush home overnight while visiting because my SIL (not my niece's Mom) called telling him her Stepfather, who had been in bad shape, had passed away.  On the way there, she called him again to say he wasn't in fact gone, and they had been able to bring him back.  So yes, it does happen.  I'm sceptical  in this case though, because 1) Posting the news wouldn't be what I would be dealing with in the first few hours.  Even if you were ready for it and had already done your mourning, you still wouldn't even know the wake hours yet and 2) If his death by terminal cancer was imminent, he probably would have been on palliative care, which means no more lifesaving intervention - sometimes meaning not even hydration - just pain control.  When my Dad was switched to palliative care, we were told it meant we could no longer call emergency services anymore because insurance wouldn't cover palliative if we were still trying to save him.  We had to call palliative instead.\n\nAt any rate, NTA.  You were resented for something you had no control over, they didn't get help for it, and there was nothing you could have done right.  They wanted to blame you for not being there while also not wanting you there.", "NTA.\nBut this is AWFUL.\nLetting siblings thinks someone is dead when they aren\u2019t. \u201cCome now\u201d \u201cno, actually, don\u2019t\u201d.\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead\u201d \u201cno he isn\u2019t\u201d.\n\n\nFunerals are for the living.

Circle of grief puts her closer to the middle than you are.", "Only if you want a relationship with them. I thought that you might (edit to add, based on your description of familial relationships), but clearly I was wrong.", "No dear. You are NTA. Not a bit of it. I also didn't attend my older brother's funeral. Here's why. He was 3 years older, our parents only biological child, and he'd always lorded it over me for that reason. Our parents abused me, and favored and coddled him. He was the golden boy, I was the adopted Cinderella child. 7 years after I was adopted, they adopted a baby boy, and 2 years after him adopted another baby boy. Lucky them, I was a ready made babysitter and housekeeper. The boys were never required to do anything chore wise, while I was required to do everything.\n\nWhen they married, none of their wives liked me at all, though I tried very hard to befriend them. I'd been so hopeful about having 'sisters', but that wasn't to be either. Years after our parents divorced, and mother had died of cancer, my older brother's wife called me to say that she and my brother had gone over the pass and cleaned out Mother's apartment, where she'd managed a motel. She wanted me to know there was a bunch of stuff on her garage floor and if I wanted any of it, I should come that afternoon, because she intended to donate the rest to Goodwill. My husband took time out of a busy workday to drive me over. She'd clearly gone through everything and took my mother's more expensive jewelry, including her engagement ring (which she'd promised to me years before) and the best of the furniture, and left nothing but odds and ends of cheap costume jewelry, a broken down electric piano, a few earrings with no mates, and that's when I saw the shredded quilt my maternal grandmother had made for me for my hope chest. Apparently mother had been keeping it for 'safe keeping' but gave it to her to use for her kids rooms. It had been laundered incorrectly and was ruined. I maintained my temper until I started walking toward the door into her home, intending to use the restroom, and she told me that I wasn't welcome to enter her home. My brother was away at work. I told my husband I was ready to go, because I needed to find a public restroom somewhere. I told my brother about it later over the phone, and he told me he agreed with his wife's behavior and decision not to allow me to use their restroom.\n\nThey used to live about 45 minutes away, and in later years decided to downsize and move to Idaho. They didn't bother telling me they were moving. I found out after the fact about 9 months after they moved, when she accidentally sent me one of her computer printed Christmas boast and brag letter.\n\nFast forward...my brother had neglected his health. He suffered with diabetes and refused to keep up his insulin schedule. He ended up having several cardiac episodes, and several small strokes, and finally his body simply started shutting down. He'd been legally blind for years. I wasn't told about this, or even that he'd died, until the evening before the graveside service at the veterans cemetery. She'd had him cremated that very day, so there was no viewing anyway, and I couldn't afford to pay for a flight to Idaho anyway. I believe I was purposefully left out of the loop so I wouldn't be there. His kids never really knew me anyway, as we were never invited to bring our son over to visit his cousins.\n\nI received a packet of family pictures that had me in them, that she apparently didn't want. That was it.\n\nIt's likely quite a few of my relatives in my extended family thought me an A-hole for not attending. But most of them had disowned and shunned me decades ago, after I left the religion they were affiliated with.\n\nYou have my sympathy, not only for the loss of a brother, but for the lack of empathy and common decency from the rest of them, including the niece. Bear in mind though, she's likely parroting things she'd heard from other relatives.", "NTA. Given all the past relationship dynamics, the bs from his wife about come now, no, it\u2019s  not that bad; he is dead, no he is not, and just generally not bothering to keep you in the loop, what is there for you to actually attend?  While you may have been there to say goodbye to your brother, you would also have been stuck in limbo, wondering who to talk to, would it be appropriate to say this, or talk to so-and-so, and oh dear, how do I answer who I am and why they have never met me, and oops, there is mother, where can I go to for a moment to be out of her sights?  All that is awkward, and when a person\u2019s presence is wanted, can be handled.  but I agree with you in thinking your presence was not really wanted.\n\nif SIL had wanted you there, she would have found a way to talk to you and make sure you knew there was a place for you there.  Niece can be forgiven for being distraught, her dad died within a relatively short period of time after diagnosis, but you are not wrong for staying home.  Just, maybe go a bit easy on the niece.\n\nI am sorry you have lost your brother, and even sorrier your relationship with him was corrupted by your father.  You did not entirely escape abuse, either.", "Are you close with your niece at all, where she felt warranted to explode that you weren't there for HER? Funerals are, after all, for the living. Because it doesn't sound like you are. HOWEVER, she had everyone else there to support her regardless, and you should not have to put yourself in a horrible situation or see people you are NC with because someone you weren't particularly close with died.

My half sister passed unexpectedly from addiction that she fought for 30 plus years. She was 18 years older than me and we were never able to build a relationship. As a kid I always dreamed of being close with my sister and having that relationship. But due to addiction, age differences and location it never happened. I think the biggest thing I grieved in her passing was that we would never get that opportunity. And it took me time to learn to accept that. I did go to her funeral because I felt like I needed to for myself. But understand and respect your reasoning as well. \n\nGive some grace to your niece and just ignore.

My heart goes out to you.", "By your reasoning I should rank higher in their lives than I do.", "No.  We were in touch via FB message throughout.
