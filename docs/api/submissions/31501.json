At first I thought it was just a mistake but even my leftovers were being eaten. It was very clear that the person was doing it on purpose. I spoke to my housemates about how I would just prefer to be asked first but they were nonchalant about it and none of them admitted to doing it and I haven't caught anyone in the act so I just tried to ignore it as it only happened every couple of days or so.\n\nA few days ago I came home from work with a carton of eggs that I found while dumpster diving and some bread. I wanted to give the eggs the water test first before eating them just to make sure that they are safe to consume but I was too tired and went to bed early without eating. The next day I found out that one of my housemates got so sick he ended up having to go to the emergency room. My eggs were not in the fridge where I left them but I saw the carton and shells in the trash and my bread was opened. I had a hunch that it was him because there was a possibility that the eggs had gone bad but I was also annoyed at the fact that he helped himself to my food without asking.\n\nWhen he came back, I asked him if he had eaten my eggs and bread but he denied. I then said okay but I hope whoever ate them doesn't get as sick as you did because I found the eggs in a dumpster. His face immediately dropped and he looked visibly uncomfortable. He got angry and went from saying that he may have consumed the food by mistake as he wasn't paying attention and doesn't exactly remember and accusing me of poisoning him.\n\nHe said that it's a health hazard to bring such food in communal spaces without warning everyone first as it's not uncommon for people in shared places to eat other people's food by mistake. He hasn't spoken to me since then and my housemates are siding with him and called me disgusting for doing that. A part of me feels like I wasn't wrong because they were MY eggs that I was fully intending on eating and I didn't think I had to warn people against eating food that didn't belong to them but I also do feel bad and guilty that he got sick. So Reddit please tell me if I was in the wrong?\n\n\n\nEDIT; Just to clarify because I see comments that suggest that I may have done it on purpose, I didn't. I have been dumpster diving for some of my food recently so I was fully intending on eating it just like I have been eating the food that I have been finding while dumpster diving. I try to exercise caution and thankfully it hasn't made me sick yet but had he not eaten it, I was probably going to end up in the ER myself because I was obviously going to eat it. \n\nI didn't randomly do it just to try bait and catch whoever has been eating my food. Food poisoning is not a joke. As I said I just moved recently and I'm just trying to get on my feet. I also understand that although I make sure to wipe my food first, ultimately it is gross to put food that came from a dumpster in a communal fridge or pantry and will not continue to do so.

Hens can carry it in their ovaries and pass it on to the forming eggs. Anti-vaxxers and organic farmers are mainly to blame for unvaccinated birds.\n\n- We wash our eggs. This removes the skin from the shells, leaving them porous and susceptible to infection and contamination. \n\n- Not all US eggs are pasteurized. Non-pasteurized eggs should be labeled with a safety warning, but it can be tiny & hard to locate. Once again, thank organic farming. \n\n- On average, one egg in a dozen may be contaminated. If left at room temperature for a couple of hours, salmonella can spread to the rest of the carton quite easily.
