My older sister (21F) is a very controlling person when it comes to her son. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t let us buy him stuff unless she wants him to have it. If we buy him a ball pit for example, if my sister didn\u2019t want it, it goes in the bin\n\nShe refuses to let her son come over to our house (we do have a negative past) but she doesn\u2019t let me or my siblings see him. My sisters fianc\u00e9s sisters get to see my nephew almost every week where I see him about once a month, sometimes not even that. \n\nHer fianc\u00e9s mom is always around at their house and spending time with my nephew but we don\u2019t even get a look in. He is turning 1 in June and I haven\u2019t seen him since he was 9 months old. \n\nMy sister is planning a family get together with my whole family and her fianc\u00e9s family. All of us in the house (our families clash constantly) and of course, birthday presents will be given to my nephew. \n\nNow for Christmas I bought him a cute Jumper but, 4 months later, it still has the tag on and it doesn\u2019t fit him anymore, it was a little white and green dinosaur jumper, My nephew is a \u201csad beige baby\u201d so anything colourful is not allowed. \n\nMy other sister (20F) was talking about what she wanted to get him for his birthday, since he\u2019s 1 he doesn\u2019t need anything big. My mom gave ideas of what she wanted to give and I said \u201cI\u2019m not getting him anything\u201d. \n\nMy family just looked at me and I said \u201cI\u2019m not wasting my money on something that will sit in a cupboard for a year then the thrown in the bin\u201d\n\nSince my siblings are all gossipers my Sister found out I wasn\u2019t getting anything and told her fianc\u00e9s mom. She asked me why I\u2019m being so nasty and I explained again that I\u2019m not spending my money on something that won\u2019t be used. Unless I can be assured that whatever I buy him will actually be used by him, he\u2019s not getting anything. \n\nI\u2019m now being called a bitch for not wanting to make my nephews first birthday special.

Go and open a bank account for your nephew. Put whatever money you would spend on presents in it. Every birthday, every Christmas, every time you can spare a little extra cache.  Let your sister know. It will drive her crazy because she will never have control over what you are doing. This is a long game. You can't win right now, but this child will thank you in the future. Your sister is an AH and you are NTA.", "With the info you\u2019ve provided I\u2019ll go NTA, it\u2019s horrible that she throws things in the bin, however is there any more info on the negative past that could still be playing a part here?! (Also side note, I\u2019ve had so many people buy so many items of clothing for my five month old that some of them have ended up no longer fitting him before he\u2019s even worn them so can maybe forgive that part if she\u2019s not done it intentionally).", "Well you could just ask your sister what she would want you to get for him, or ask her, if it's okay before buying something. You said you have a bad past so i get that your relationship is a little rocky but that should not happen between you and you nephew.\n\nEdit: forgot to add NTA", "NTA - The kid is 1 years old, doesn't even know it's his birthday. If the gifts aren't appreciated, then I wouldn't waste money either. I had a situation like that once with my own nephews. I got them really cool Lego sets, but when they unwrapped their gifts, they were mumbling that those were not exactly what they wanted. Never got them anything again.", "NTA --- The only person getting upset about a 1-year-old not getting a birthday gift is the parents at that age they don't understand the concept of birthdays and gifts.", "I think it depends on what you mean by negative past. Has your sister made decisions not to include your family for a reason? Was the lack of use for the jumper purposeful?  Or did it simply get forgotten?\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for your decision but def need more details to really know.", "NTA. There's no point in consumerism for the sake of it. Kid won't remember, sister sounds like she will be awful either way so you may as well save some money while you're at it.", "Nta, your sister is projecting herself onto her (probably sad) baby", "NTA but what on the earth is a sad beige baby ?", "E S H. Mostly your sister, but there are ways to get stuff that he will use. Gift vouchers, or keepsakes that need to go in a cupboard until he's old enough to use them safely. I still have the silver moneybox I was given for my first birthday.\n\nEdit - NTA. Your sister clearly doesn't care what is given. I'd likely buy something as a keepsake to give him when he's old enough to appreciate it, so he can see one day that he's been treasured by his family since the start.", "NTA \nUnless they ask for anything get a gift card for somewhere that offers clothes, that way you are getting him something and she can choose what she wants. \n\nIf you want a relationship with your nephew continue to talk to your sister, that's the only way you'll get one. Whether you like it or not she's the parent and gets the final decision - right or wrong won't matter.", "NTA - Based on what you said. However it depends on the negative pas - if your family treated her badly, she cut ties but is still letting you see him sometimes, then YTA. If it was her fault, or she is treating the fianc\u00e9e's family different for no reason, than NTA.", "NTA you need to help her get a clue and come back to planet earth.", "NTA.", "NTA. The kid's ONE. Honestly, they'll never even know if you brought them a present or not. It's silly getting kids that young elaborate gifts at that age unless you're really close to them. Sounds like you barely see him so who cares? If she pushes and you feel like being maliciously compliant, you could buy the loudest, most obnoxious cheap toy you can get your hands on, and enthusiastically demonstrate it repeatedly at the party and the pretense of \"playing with your nephew with the new cool toy\".", "I had a friend who bought their niece/nephew a tree somewhere, or sponsored a platypus (or something similar) as a birthday present as the recipient was never appreciative of the input. \n\nPerhaps do that for your nephew, donate $50 to your favourite  charity, or find out what your SIL donates to and do one on the nephews behalf. \n\nAlso, the nephew is 1. I recall kids being way more interested in wrapping paper for their first few birthdays.\n\nAnd, the 1st birthday was always about the parents surviving their first year as being parents!!\n\nNTA.", "YTA - cmon dude you either buy the gift because it comes from your heart and your a witness to your sisters evil acts or just don\u2019t if you really don\u2019t care.

It\u2019s weirdly hilarious. I have 15+ nieces and nephews between me and my husband. I purposely ask what they want for their bdays so I don\u2019t buy things that they won\u2019t use. That\u2019s an extra $400-$500 a year for me out of pocket. However I don\u2019t like showing up to a party without  a gift. You could always purchase a small book and write a sweet note. But I saw your sister sells stuff on FB lol", "NTA.\nYou are not required to attend a birthday party, nor required to purchase a gift. The one year old certainly won't care or remember. \n\nI'm not a big fan of children, and I get real tired of people constantly acting like everyone around them is supposed to support their kiddos. If you've ever worked in a large office, you could seriously go broke buying all the fundraising junk parents will pimp for their kids.\n\nAnd I'm totally fine being the AH that doesn't play those games. \n\nA gift is more special when given at random and from the heart. Not a social requirement.", "That\u2019s actually a really good idea. Thanks for that I might try that :)", "This is brilliant actually. OP, I hope you follow through with this.", "Brilliant idea!  If in the U.S., buy Savings Bonds or safe investments that will grow as he grows.   Doubt you\u2019ll see your nephew much though going forward.  NTA", "That\u2019s a fabulous idea!", "The negative past is with my mum, they used to argue a lot and got into fights constantly. She purposely sells things that she doesn\u2019t want, my mum bought a keepsake for him and she sold it on Facebook because she didn\u2019t want it", "I had an idea at Christmas to buy him a ball pit and she said \u201cno we\u2019re getting him one\u201d she never did get him one. I asked again to buy it a few weeks ago and she again told me she was getting it. Still never bought one. I\u2019ve asked her stuff he needs and she\u2019ll say \u201cclothes\u201d so we get him clothes and she doesn\u2019t accept them", "So my sister and my mum have a negative past together with arguments and disagreements, that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t bring my nephew to the house.

Nothing to do with me", "I do want to get him something because I feel bad but I don\u2019t want it going to waste", "His room is so plain, I feel horrible for him. He\u2019s deaf so he needs visual stimulation but there\u2019s nothing for him to look at. All his toys are brown or pale blue, his clothes are brown, sage green, white or blue.

This keeps it as YOUR money not money that is obligated to be used for your nephew", "Oh ok yeah that sounds bad, standing with NTA then, no point wasting your money if she\u2019ll either sell it or bin it", "FWIW, my parents gifted kids savings bonds for them to be available upon graduation.
