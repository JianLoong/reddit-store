Go and open a bank account for your nephew. Put whatever money you would spend on presents in it. Every birthday, every Christmas, every time you can spare a little extra cache.  Let your sister know. It will drive her crazy because she will never have control over what you are doing. This is a long game. You can't win right now, but this child will thank you in the future. Your sister is an AH and you are NTA.", "With the info you\u2019ve provided I\u2019ll go NTA, it\u2019s horrible that she throws things in the bin, however is there any more info on the negative past that could still be playing a part here?!

If the gifts aren't appreciated, then I wouldn't waste money either. I had a situation like that once with my own nephews. I got them really cool Lego sets, but when they unwrapped their gifts, they were mumbling that those were not exactly what they wanted. Never got them anything again.", "NTA --- The only person getting upset about a 1-year-old not getting a birthday gift is the parents at that age they don't understand the concept of birthdays and gifts.", "I think it depends on what you mean by negative past. Has your sister made decisions not to include your family for a reason? Was the lack of use for the jumper purposeful?  Or did it simply get forgotten?\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for your decision but def need more details to really know.", "NTA. There's no point in consumerism for the sake of it.

Mostly your sister, but there are ways to get stuff that he will use. Gift vouchers, or keepsakes that need to go in a cupboard until he's old enough to use them safely. I still have the silver moneybox I was given for my first birthday.\n\nEdit - NTA. Your sister clearly doesn't care what is given. I'd likely buy something as a keepsake to give him when he's old enough to appreciate it, so he can see one day that he's been treasured by his family since the start.", "NTA \nUnless they ask for anything get a gift card for somewhere that offers clothes, that way you are getting him something and she can choose what she wants. \n\nIf you want a relationship with your nephew continue to talk to your sister, that's the only way you'll get one. Whether you like it or not she's the parent and gets the final decision - right or wrong won't matter.", "NTA - Based on what you said. However it depends on the negative pas - if your family treated her badly, she cut ties but is still letting you see him sometimes, then YTA.

The kid's ONE. Honestly, they'll never even know if you brought them a present or not. It's silly getting kids that young elaborate gifts at that age unless you're really close to them. Sounds like you barely see him so who cares?

I recall kids being way more interested in wrapping paper for their first few birthdays.\n\nAnd, the 1st birthday was always about the parents surviving their first year as being parents!!\n\nNTA.", "YTA - cmon dude you either buy the gift because it comes from your heart and your a witness to your sisters evil acts or just don\u2019t if you really don\u2019t care.

It\u2019s weirdly hilarious. I have 15+ nieces and nephews between me and my husband. I purposely ask what they want for their bdays so I don\u2019t buy things that they won\u2019t use. That\u2019s an extra $400-$500 a year for me out of pocket. However I don\u2019t like showing up to a party without  a gift. You could always purchase a small book and write a sweet note. But I saw your sister sells stuff on FB lol", "NTA.\nYou are not required to attend a birthday party, nor required to purchase a gift. The one year old certainly won't care or remember. \n\nI'm not a big fan of children, and I get real tired of people constantly acting like everyone around them is supposed to support their kiddos. If you've ever worked in a large office, you could seriously go broke buying all the fundraising junk parents will pimp for their kids.\n\nAnd I'm totally fine being the AH that doesn't play those games. \n\nA gift is more special when given at random and from the heart.

I wouldn't get mad for not getting a present though, or for getting something i didn't like. \n\nSo ESH, there's never a guarantee that the person will like your gift and you can easily get her something that she'd definitely be able to use. Your sister shouldn't be throwing a tantrum about it though, especially if she knows she probably won't want the present.", "NTA. I saw a comment suggesting you take the money you would have spent on birthday/Christmas gifts and put it in an account for your nephew. That sounds like the perfect solution.

They stated their mother beat them for the smallest things, verbally abused, etc... and she also has untreated illnesses and is at risk of losing her leg.

My 3rd wears hand me downs from his sister and his brother and like both of them he can choose what to wear when he can express his opinions, but until then there\u2019s no harm in him wearing her old pink coat or whatever else (he\u2019s a baby at this point)", "Well, one of your own posts states your monos physically abusive and \n\n> \u201cShe used to beat us for the smallest things, she would tell us she never wanted us and that she wished we were dead.\u201d\n\nNo wonder your sister doesn\u2019t want a keepsake from your mom.

Telling her that you are doing something, she just cant control it is better than pretending you are doing nothing for a \"gotcha\" moment later on.", "No sarcasm here. But are there really any 100% for babies only stores? Like, I'm racking my brain but coming up with nothing for stores that are 100% baby and have gift card options.\n\nMost stores sell maternity clothes and mother supplies as well as baby stuff.", "Oh well might be different depending in where you live. We do have baby stores where it's all only baby stuff (clothes, stuffies etc.)", "Ah gotcha. It's a good idea then but people sell gift cards on Facebook too. So it seems OP is in a no win situation.", "Well yeah i she could always sell it of course, but it's am option because then OP won't run into the problem of getting something she won't use so she could just get something she actually wants him to have. Also another comment said to open up a bank account and just putting money into it for him, what i found to be a great idea. But i agree it's a very difficult situation"]}
