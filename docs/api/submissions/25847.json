If they end up trashing the place, then what?! You guys did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nWithout knowing why you were removed from the wedding, I'm honestly just stuck on that point. If someone removed me from the wedding party AND attending, simply because their partner is a controlling a-hole, I'd remove that friend from my life.\n\nMaybe they should have spent 2 minutes thinking about how you'd fronted money for the bachelorette party, and how uninviting you would not only cost you money, but cause massive issues for that event. Maybe if they had, they'd have realised that any self-respecting person would cancel the booking, cut their losses, and move on. This friend isn't going to be the person you remember if she's already caving to her partner like this. Who TF removes their best friend from the wedding!? Did you sleep with her fiance or something?", "NTA\n\nCancel the Airbnb.  Pay the $1000 cancellation fee from the $1500 you had been given.  Distribute the remaining $500 to the people who has given you money with the explanation that you had been removed from the bridal party and couldn't take the risk of being responsible for damages at a bachelorette to which you weren't welcome.  Tell them the rest of the money was used to pay the cancellation fee and they would need to talk to Bride about getting that money and their new bachelorette plans.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe canceled you as a bridesmaid, you canceled your contribution. That's reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"A part of me feels like I could have trusted her to look after the place since she doesn\u2019t drink.\" .. A party at an AirBNB is problematic, it will ruin YOUR reputation and YOU will pay. And you will not be there to make surethe worst ideas will be stopped.\n\n\"I also feel like I can front her the money in good faith & hope we can even it out later. \" ... They haven't paid the rest so far - why would you trust them to pay later?", "NTA \n\nYou aren't attending, you may not even be going to her wedding. Unless this is a wedding gift which it isn't. This isn't your problem.", "I\u2019m going to say again how weird it is that he doesn\u2019t trust you to be a bridesmaid, but he trusts you to be at her bachelorette party, even though you \u201cled her astray\u201d at a previous bachelorette party. I think this is a power play on his part. You will not be allowed to attend the wedding, and you\u2019ll be informed at the last minute. \n\nAnd because of all that, because neither of them is being honest or fair or even slightly decent toward you, you cannot trust her when it comes to this rental. Simply because you cannot trust *him,* and she does what he says, no matter how ridiculous. So cancel the reservation to be safe.", "NTA. Why should you be responsible for the accommodations for a bridal party you were kicked out of?", "Sounds like he\u2019s getting rid of her friends", "NTA\n\nJust based on what you have said above. I didnt read your original post regarding being removed as bridesmaid and attendee at the wedding.\n\nHowever, if you arent even permitted to be at the airbnb anymore (due to the 'issue') then you would be well within your right to cancel it.\n\nYou are absolutely right not to trust that she will look after the place, if you arent there because its not she who would be responsible if it gets trashed.\n\nAdditionally 'fronting her the money' is not a wise move (imho) because when there are issues in a relationship you just dont want to get money in the middle of it.\n\nSince you are no longer invited, this is most definitely no longer your responsibility. Whoever the MOH is, can take care of the details (or her fiance can).", "NTA\n\nSo you've paid $2000 and got $1500 back. \n\nI'm no expert in maths but that seems to be uneven.\n\nHonestly if you aren't to receive the remainder from the people utilizing the place I'd suggest getting the refund. You are essentially paying these people $500 to use an Airbnb that is yours. \n\nOn top of that you won't be present. If something happens you have no knowledge to dispute it and it could cost you further. \n\nPerhaps before cancelling it talk to someone using it and have them get you the remaining $500 and sign something that they will accept liability for the accommodation if only to protect yourself. If they don't agree just say you will be forced to refund it and then everyone loses.", "NTA. None of it is your responsibility, and the fianc\u00e9 is rude to cut you from the wedding. But I gather that you are not telling us everything; I mean, there must be some reasoning.", "NTA. You never should shoulder liability for someone else. Also don't assume that you will get your money back. You were dumped from the event. It's not your problem.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable that if you\u2019ve been uninvited then you\u2019re not in a position any more to be organising any part of the celebrations. And with no skin in the game who knows how they\u2019d treat the Airbnb.", "NTA.", "INFO: Why were you removed from being a bridesmaid and the bachelorette party by her fianc\u00e9? And what did she said, after you told her?\n\nYou should let her know, that you are gona cancle the AirBnB since you won't be there and are not confortable to be liable if something happen to the place. Or let your husband do that, if he is willing to take the blame. But they should not expect you to pay for the location where you will not go to.\n\nBut let her know as soon as possible. So they can look for another place. Also maybe offer to talk to the host, if it would be possible, if you cancle the reservation, that they can make a reservation for a discount price - or hopefully just the money they get back because of the canceling.", "YTA if you don\u2019t give all of those people their money back.

I remember your first post and this is the fault of her future husband. Keep the $500 you paid and redistribute the other $1000 back to the people who gave you money. You shouldn't have to eat the cost of the cancelation when it was the bride and grooms fault it got canceled. They can cover the difference to the other bridesmaids.", "INFO. What did the bride to be say when you told her you didn\u2019t feel like attending the bachelorette weekend due to her fianc\u00e9\u2019s crap?", "Long story short, we went to two of my guy best friend\u2019s house after a local bar/restaurant closed at midnight. It was one of those places that have ring toss, giant tic tac toe games, corn hole, ect. Nothing crazy. It was 4 girls: my best friend, her little sister, a pregnant girl, & myself. The two guys were my flower boys at my wedding. Friends of mine for roughly 10 years. The pregnant girl & her were drinking mock-tails. Her little sister and I both had a marg. As soon as we got to their place they started arguing. She never spent time with the group. She told me after 20ish mins and we took off. He solely blames me. My best friend openly admits that he knows it was her little sister\u2019s idea but since he can\u2019t get upset with her I\u2019m the root of the problem. They have been arguing about me since March. Last week I was kicked out of the bridal shower and this week I cancelled the Airbnb.", "Her husband payed 2k. She got back 1.5k. She will be given 1k back. They are already down 1k from family budget.", "Then those attendees need to speak to the bride who made the decision to kick out the person who was responsible for the accommodations. \n\nExpecting someone to keep an AirBNb reservation that they are liable for, but won\u2019t be present at, is unreasonable.", "Did I misunderstand? Bride was part of friends group that went to have an after party at private home? Somehow it became an argument and you were named as the scapegoat? Why? What? How?\n\nEdit: after reading your comment history, it seems that groom just doesn\u2019t want the bride to have a life outside him and their kids. So bride being in other man\u2019s house would be \u201calmost like cheating and tempting her to run away\u201d. Bonkers, but if your friend really wants to live like that\u2026 just tell her that she can contact you when she wants or needs help. Don\u2019t go NC because she might be in abusive relationship. \n\nEdit edit: I approve cancelling everything and taking some distance from them", "I\u2019m not telling you what to do but I would definitely go no/low contact because all this sounds draining and they blame you for nothing", "I disagree and can guarantee you if she\u2019d gotten sick and couldn\u2019t attend she wouldn\u2019t be cancelling it. Either way, the decision is costing people (not the bride) money.", "Getting sick and not being able to go is vastly different to being told they are no longer invited and can't go but they still have to pay.\n\nThe groom can cover the cost of his choice to force his bride to cancel her bridesmaid."]}
