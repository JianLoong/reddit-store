If someone removed me from the wedding party AND attending, simply because their partner is a controlling a-hole, I'd remove that friend from my life.\n\nMaybe they should have spent 2 minutes thinking about how you'd fronted money for the bachelorette party, and how uninviting you would not only cost you money, but cause massive issues for that event. Maybe if they had, they'd have realised that any self-respecting person would cancel the booking, cut their losses, and move on. This friend isn't going to be the person you remember if she's already caving to her partner like this. Who TF removes their best friend from the wedding!? Did you sleep with her fiance or something?", "NTA\n\nCancel the Airbnb.  Pay the $1000 cancellation fee from the $1500 you had been given.  Distribute the remaining $500 to the people who has given you money with the explanation that you had been removed from the bridal party and couldn't take the risk of being responsible for damages at a bachelorette to which you weren't welcome.

They haven't paid the rest so far - why would you trust them to pay later?", "NTA \n\nYou aren't attending, you may not even be going to her wedding. Unless this is a wedding gift which it isn't.

I think this is a power play on his part. You will not be allowed to attend the wedding, and you\u2019ll be informed at the last minute. \n\nAnd because of all that, because neither of them is being honest or fair or even slightly decent toward you, you cannot trust her when it comes to this rental. Simply because you cannot trust *him,* and she does what he says, no matter how ridiculous. So cancel the reservation to be safe.", "NTA. Why should you be responsible for the accommodations for a bridal party you were kicked out of?", "Sounds like he\u2019s getting rid of her friends", "NTA\n\nJust based on what you have said above. I didnt read your original post regarding being removed as bridesmaid and attendee at the wedding.\n\nHowever, if you arent even permitted to be at the airbnb anymore (due to the 'issue') then you would be well within your right to cancel it.\n\nYou are absolutely right not to trust that she will look after the place, if you arent there because its not she who would be responsible if it gets trashed.\n\nAdditionally 'fronting her the money' is not a wise move (imho) because when there are issues in a relationship you just dont want to get money in the middle of it.\n\nSince you are no longer invited, this is most definitely no longer your responsibility. Whoever the MOH is, can take care of the details (or her fiance can).", "NTA\n\nSo you've paid $2000 and got $1500 back. \n\nI'm no expert in maths but that seems to be uneven.\n\nHonestly if you aren't to receive the remainder from the people utilizing the place I'd suggest getting the refund. You are essentially paying these people $500 to use an Airbnb that is yours. \n\nOn top of that you won't be present. If something happens you have no knowledge to dispute it and it could cost you further. \n\nPerhaps before cancelling it talk to someone using it and have them get you the remaining $500 and sign something that they will accept liability for the accommodation if only to protect yourself. If they don't agree just say you will be forced to refund it and then everyone loses.", "NTA. None of it is your responsibility, and the fianc\u00e9 is rude to cut you from the wedding. But I gather that you are not telling us everything; I mean, there must be some reasoning.", "NTA. You never should shoulder liability for someone else. Also don't assume that you will get your money back. You were dumped from the event. It's not your problem.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable that if you\u2019ve been uninvited then you\u2019re not in a position any more to be organising any part of the celebrations.

Or let your husband do that, if he is willing to take the blame. But they should not expect you to pay for the location where you will not go to.\n\nBut let her know as soon as possible. So they can look for another place.

It was one of those places that have ring toss, giant tic tac toe games, corn hole, ect. Nothing crazy. It was 4 girls: my best friend, her little sister, a pregnant girl, & myself. The two guys were my flower boys at my wedding. Friends of mine for roughly 10 years. The pregnant girl & her were drinking mock-tails. Her little sister and I both had a marg. As soon as we got to their place they started arguing. She never spent time with the group. She told me after 20ish mins and we took off. He solely blames me. My best friend openly admits that he knows it was her little sister\u2019s idea but since he can\u2019t get upset with her I\u2019m the root of the problem.

Bride was part of friends group that went to have an after party at private home? Somehow it became an argument and you were named as the scapegoat? Why? What? How?\n\nEdit: after reading your comment history, it seems that groom just doesn\u2019t want the bride to have a life outside him and their kids. So bride being in other man\u2019s house would be \u201calmost like cheating and tempting her to run away\u201d. Bonkers, but if your friend really wants to live like that\u2026 just tell her that she can contact you when she wants or needs help.

You guys did the right thing.", "it is not smart to take those kind of risks in the best of circumstances.", "NTA but my reading of this is that the Airbnb cost was being split between 4 people; op, bride, and 2 bridesmaids.  I would say it is not fair to make those other two bridesmaids eat the $500 cost.  I would say either return the other two bridesmaids money and keep the $500 from the bride so that you are out the original 500 and then you can request that the bride make you whole, or if that's just really not feasible then maybe return half of the money, 750 so that everyone's only out 250 bucks.

She will figure something out. NTA", "NTA. If there are any damages, your husband will be responsible and since you can\u2019t even get paid for the booking, do you really think you\u2019d get paid for damages? Spoiler- you won\u2019t.

Make sure you get the $1000 back, only then return the $500 from the Brides maid money. You get your $2000 back and they deal with everything else their damn selves. \n\nThe husband wants control of everything, let him control trip finances, not you and your husband. \n\nNTA\n\nAlso this is why I'm not having any bridesmaids or bachelorette parties.

OP shouldn't be losing any money in this. she's not the one who caused all this to happen.", "So if he\u2019s so upset about a personal get-together with 5 other people do you logically, reasonably think he\u2019s going to let her have a bachelorette overnight?  That he\u2019s not going to start a fight or contrive an emergency or somehow get it cancelled or invite himself along?  If this is how he is I don\u2019t see a bachelorette actually happening anyway.  You pulling the room might be the excuse and he\u2019ll try to scapegoat you, you should prepare for that, but I bet he\u2019s going to be looking for any reason to put a stop to this anyway.", "The BRIDE AND GROOM uninvited her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo THEY would need to repay any losses of the other guests.", "Naa they spent 2k. \n\n-2k \n\nThey got back 1500 from bridesmaid's. \n\n-2000 +1500 = -500\n\nThey will get back half of the charge so another 1000. \n\n-500 + 1000 = 500 \n\nThey will be up 500 dollars in the transaction and can give that money back to the bridesmaid's.

I would give back the full $1500 to the bridesmaids and if the bride does not want you to attend the bachelorette, She pays you back the cancellation fee.

How many times has it been fun and not stressful?\n\nI'm confused by this also. Having been on a couple no major drama happened on either. I feel like my friends are just too god darn responsible. No fun.", "But I do assume OP wants ti give back all 1500? \nThx for correcting, I'm not good at math", "I see, but I assume Op wants to give back all 1500, no?", "i disagree. OP can't count on bride to pay her back the cancellation fee (good grief she couldn't even count on bride to stick up for her under the simplest of circumstances) and the only reason there is a cancellation is bc of bride's decision.\n\nso bride & her *lovely* fianc\u00e9 can be the ones to be accountable for the results of their own actions, and they can refund the remaining bridesmaids (or pay for their new accommodations). OP doesn't owe any of them anything. she is not the one that created this problem.", "That's definitely not the worst, overly responsible tends to need less bail money lol. \n\nI ditched my best friend and MOH duties because BF said before we left for the bachelorette she wanted to cheat with a mutual friend. When I said I wouldn't be a part of it she flipped out then cancelled the bachelorette party I paid for. \n\nI am marrying that mutual friend in February! They did not sleep together, but he said he probably would have just because BF's fiance was a complete asshole. \n\nEvery other bachelorette has been drunk crying, boring tea party or cancelled. \n\nHard pass!", "I wouldn't. Post says she might not only be removed as a bridesmaid but also could be excluded from attending the wedding. When you are planning a wedding, don't rely on anyone for anything important if you might literally uninvite them from the wedding. Not because you are worried they will screw you over, but because if they are in a position where you might uninvite them, they aren't important enough to you for you to put any responsibility on them. This couple let OP do a lor more than they should have for the wedding and it shouldn't be surprising if it costs them a little bit of money by making her feel unwelcome and potentially uninviting her.", "They weren\u2019t advised they can\u2019t go to the bachelorette though, your premise is incorrect. I voted NTA on her original post, but in my opinion this decision is an AH decision because the choice impacts multiple other people who had nothing to do with her exclusion from the wedding. Also if the groom is that kind of person what gives you any faith that he would cover the loss for the other attendees?", "Then that\u2019s the bride\u2019s problem for being spineless and a bad friend. They can take it up with her."]}
