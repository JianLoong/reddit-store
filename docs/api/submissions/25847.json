Most said no and agreed that I shouldn\u2019t attend. \n\nFollowing advice from Reddit, I messaged my best friend of 15 years, expressing my love for her but also explaining that I can\u2019t attend a bachelorette party (in 2 weeks) knowing I am excluded by her fianc\u00e9 from being a bridesmaid and potentially attending her wedding. \n\nThe current issue is that my husband (34M)  booked the Airbnb. He paid roughly 2k for the stay. I received slightly less then $1,500 from all the girls. He doesn\u2019t feel comfortable being liable for a place I won\u2019t be looking after. Canceling the Airbnb passed 48hours results in a 50% refund. I contacted the host and asked if they could transfer ownership but they couldn\u2019t. The best they could do is give her a discount to offsets the loss. My husband suggest we wait to receive the money back to avoid confusion. He rather hand her the money with the receipt and end it there. My issue is that I know she\u2019s counting on it and probably panicking since her batch is 2 weeks away. \n\nI\u2019m completely torn. A part of me feels like I could have trusted her to look after the place since she doesn\u2019t drink. I also feel like I can front her the money in good faith & hope we can even it out later. The other side of me thinks none of it is my responsibility.\n\n\nUpdate: I sat down and wrote down the numbers. The Airbnb was 2k. There was 11 girls (not all are bridesmaids) each of us paid 182. I received a total of $1,287 from 8 girls (some have a balance) my 182 brings us to $1,469. I covered the rest ($531) with the idea I was eventually going to get paid by the last two girls. My question is: do I take a 50% hit too? Or do I take my contribution out entirely? And then give her the remaining balance? Someone help me do the math!\n\n*BTW I\u2019m not requesting any money back from the activities or matching clothing she requested.

If someone removed me from the wedding party AND attending, simply because their partner is a controlling a-hole, I'd remove that friend from my life.\n\nMaybe they should have spent 2 minutes thinking about how you'd fronted money for the bachelorette party, and how uninviting you would not only cost you money, but cause massive issues for that event. Maybe if they had, they'd have realised that any self-respecting person would cancel the booking, cut their losses, and move on. This friend isn't going to be the person you remember if she's already caving to her partner like this. Who TF removes their best friend from the wedding!? Did you sleep with her fiance or something?", "NTA\n\nCancel the Airbnb.  Pay the $1000 cancellation fee from the $1500 you had been given.  Distribute the remaining $500 to the people who has given you money with the explanation that you had been removed from the bridal party and couldn't take the risk of being responsible for damages at a bachelorette to which you weren't welcome.

I think this is a power play on his part. You will not be allowed to attend the wedding, and you\u2019ll be informed at the last minute. \n\nAnd because of all that, because neither of them is being honest or fair or even slightly decent toward you, you cannot trust her when it comes to this rental. Simply because you cannot trust *him,* and she does what he says, no matter how ridiculous. So cancel the reservation to be safe.", "NTA. Why should you be responsible for the accommodations for a bridal party you were kicked out of?", "Sounds like he\u2019s getting rid of her friends", "NTA\n\nJust based on what you have said above. I didnt read your original post regarding being removed as bridesmaid and attendee at the wedding.\n\nHowever, if you arent even permitted to be at the airbnb anymore (due to the 'issue') then you would be well within your right to cancel it.\n\nYou are absolutely right not to trust that she will look after the place, if you arent there because its not she who would be responsible if it gets trashed.\n\nAdditionally 'fronting her the money' is not a wise move (imho) because when there are issues in a relationship you just dont want to get money in the middle of it.\n\nSince you are no longer invited, this is most definitely no longer your responsibility. Whoever the MOH is, can take care of the details (or her fiance can).", "NTA\n\nSo you've paid $2000 and got $1500 back. \n\nI'm no expert in maths but that seems to be uneven.\n\nHonestly if you aren't to receive the remainder from the people utilizing the place I'd suggest getting the refund. You are essentially paying these people $500 to use an Airbnb that is yours. \n\nOn top of that you won't be present. If something happens you have no knowledge to dispute it and it could cost you further. \n\nPerhaps before cancelling it talk to someone using it and have them get you the remaining $500 and sign something that they will accept liability for the accommodation if only to protect yourself. If they don't agree just say you will be forced to refund it and then everyone loses.", "NTA. None of it is your responsibility, and the fianc\u00e9 is rude to cut you from the wedding.

Or let your husband do that, if he is willing to take the blame. But they should not expect you to pay for the location where you will not go to.\n\nBut let her know as soon as possible.

Bride was part of friends group that went to have an after party at private home? Somehow it became an argument and you were named as the scapegoat? Why? What?

So bride being in other man\u2019s house would be \u201calmost like cheating and tempting her to run away\u201d.

When you are planning a wedding, don't rely on anyone for anything important if you might literally uninvite them from the wedding. Not because you are worried they will screw you over, but because if they are in a position where you might uninvite them, they aren't important enough to you for you to put any responsibility on them.
