Why do you want to do all the traditional things which are free for you, but for the one that costs you money, suddenly tradition goes out the window?\n\nYou\u2019re not necessarily TA, I\u2019m leaning towards ESH. However, remember that she will likely be wearing that ring for the rest of her life (or at least as long as you\u2019re married).\n\nDo you really want her lifelong associations with that ring to be an argument about how you wouldn\u2019t get her the one she wanted?\n\nThere are wider issues here, though. It seems you\u2019re both bad at compromising (e.g., giving one partner full authority to decide the kids\u2019 names), which can lead to an unhealthy relationship.", "ESH\n\nIt's a bit difficult to judge overall because you don't really say what you see as \"expensive\" vs \"cheap\", and what she's asking for may not be completely unreasonable. However, based on the information we've been given, neither one of you looks great.\n\nYou're right that she's being a hypocrite (and therefore an AH) by insisting on a double standard, where \"tradition\" is only important or even acceptable to her when it works in her favour. When it doesn't - with last names, baby names, wedding traditions - she's all in on calling it misogynistic. When it gets her expensive jewelry, suddenly it's not only not anti-feminist, it's DEEPLY IMPORTANT. \n\nTo be clear, there's nothing wrong with her not wanting a cheap engagement ring. In fact, where YOU are a bit of an AH is in considering that this isn't just about \"tradition\" but the fact that this is a piece of jewelry that she's hopefully going to be wearing every day for the rest of her life. So yeah, you're a bit of an AH for \"wanting to get a cheap engagement ring\". I would think that for something that's meant to represent your love, that she's going to wear daily for decades, and that's usually nicer and more elaborate than the wedding ring (which is usually a fairly simple band), you would want to at least splurge a LITTLE, even if you don't want to spend an unreasonable amount. Saying that you literally want to get one that's \"cheap\" (rather than saying that you'd rather not spend more than you can reasonably afford) is gross. \n\nSo ESH. Her for double standards and not being willing to compromise, and you for not even trying to find a reasonable middle ground either, and admitting that you want to be \"cheap\" about something meaningful that's meant to represent your love.

That is perfectly fine since you are still a year out from getting engaged but it means that you're going off assumptions and making firm decisions and getting into arguments about it before even having the facts. Your first step should not be to turn to Reddit to assign blame; it should be to inform yourself and talk with your girlfriend.\n\nIt's not clear from your post what is happening (Is she actually demanding a mined diamond? Is she demanding a certain, excessive price point? Does she just want quality material and craftsmanship? Are you being cheap? What's the cost vs your income vs other discretionary spending? etc) and I suspect it's because you yourself don't actually have a clear picture. Makes it hard to judge.\n\nEven your agreement on the names is unclear.\n\n> She now says it's the traditional thing to do and will send me videos that try and justify it.\n\nWhile it's actually perfectly fine to pick and choose (refusing tradition means refusing to be bound by tradition, not mindlessly doing the contrary of tradition for the sake of being anti-traditional) and it's ok for her to want a nice ring within reason, it's not OK to want a modern relationship but then use tradition to push your partner to do things they don't want. \n\nAnd who argues by sending their partner videos instead of explaining your position and your you feel, listening to understand where they come from, and striving to find a solution that works for both of you, compromising if need be?\n\nIt's hard to judge with the little you provided but based on that, ESH, your girlfriend more than you. \n\nAs an aside, are you sure your values, outlook on life, etc align?", "ESH you two sound completely incompatible and that\u2019s even with missing information on both sides\u2026 you should just break up.", "NTA..if she's shunning all other traditions why not this one?

The engagement ring is the one that traditionally has the big fancy diamond everyone focuses on. The wedding ring is usually a simpler band (think more along the lines of a man's traditional wedding ring) and that is what you'd put on her finger at the alter. Most places will sell you the engagement and wedding rings as a pair, but the wedding rings usually aren't that expensive since they usually don't have large or intricate stone work.

The ring, more than the other traditions you named, seems to be more about symbolizing commitment than erasing a woman's autonomy. \n\nThat being said... there are good reasons to avoid diamonds (generally unethical, artificially inflated value), and I'm fairly sure that the gifting of jewelry originates in a need for portable wealth, in case you're stuck fleeing a war, or in dowry traditions... neither of these deserve much respect these days. \n\nSo yeah, I feel like if she gets to make ethical arguments against tradition so do you, and I think that the evidence is on your side.", "I agree with shedding tradition.

The modern engagement ring actually started as a bit of a reaction to the misogynistic power imbalance in dating and marriage, as a form of insurance for jilted women, and has since become its own thing.\n\nPersonally I agree with you, it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of money on an engagement ring. But she has told you that a nice ring matters to her. So you need to negotiate. Is it the price tag that attracts her and repels you? Or is it that it is a piece of jewellery she will be expected to wear nearly every day for the rest of her life, and she wants it to be something she enjoys wearing? You two need to sit down and negotiate this.\n\nFyi, since engagement rings have very low resale value, there are ways to save significantly on the cost.

In addition, women continue to comment on engagement rings for as long as they\u2019re worn. I have commented on multiple woman\u2019s rings when I meet them and they\u2019re always very happy to tell me all the details about the ring. Even if it\u2019s wrong, I definitely place women in different social statuses upon seeing their rings (at least initially until I get to know them better. It\u2019s kinda like clothing). \n\n3) it tells other men to back off lol\n\nAnyway, those are my reasons for wanting a ring even though we\u2019re planning to elope and I\u2019m not sure if I want to change my name.

I am not clear on what you think as an enormous sum.\n\nI got engaged last year and I was involved in buying it.

We absolutely could have gotten something cheaper, put that money into savings or whatever. I am glad every day that we did not. An engagement ring is something that you wear every day, that will hopefully be worn (in my case anyhow for hopefully at least fifty years). We got a lab grown diamond so it was cheaper and we know for sure is not a blood diamond. Diamond is strong enough to survive me for the rest of my life and remain looking good. Cheaper stones will not last as long. I spent a lot of time researching and I knew that for me I wanted good colour and good clarity but didn't care as much about the carat. We ended up getting a good carat too because it was lab grown. Per wear, it'll  roughly work out as .10c, over my lifetime. Spending the money now means I won't have to buy it again.\n\nOne thing that I didn't know before getting engaged, even though my mother had said it, was how much people use your engagement ring to size you up. It communicates a lot about you before you even open your mouth. I don't think that you should make life decisions based on what other people think but I do think you need to be happy with your decision to be comfortable with that attention on this one piece of jewellery.

See if there's a compromise to be had - can you use lab diamonds or a strong nontraditional stone that's a bit cheaper? Would you be willing to spend a bit more than you're comfortable with and she can make up the difference?

My wedding set is lab grown and a similar set of mined diamonds would cost significantly more. We picked it out together so I had no problem with lab grown- some people do.  For me though, no one\u2019s going to know the difference looking at it and I\u2019d rather have saved money where possible. Moissanite is also becoming a popular choice because they shine brighter than diamonds but are much cheaper per carat or whatever.", "I feel like at that point an \"engagement down payment on a house\" is a much better financial move.\n\nMy wife and I bought a camper with the money we saved on our rings. We get way more enjoyment out of it than our rings.", "This right here... this dude's a walking oxymoron...", "This is false unless you're only set on diamonds.

It's definitely possible to get a ring for $1500. If you want a colored gemstone, so t ask for engagement rings. If you want a diamond, then get a man-made diamond.", "The trick is to not buy an \"engagement\" ring. Anything can be an engagement ring as long as you both agree. It could be a generic ring (which you can definitely buy for less than 1.5k) that you propose with.", "That is a good point.", "My lab diamond is 1.2 carats & cost $5500, it\u2019s high quality & looks like it\u2019s 4 carats cuz of the way it\u2019s cut. $1500 is ridiculously low & 1/4 of his yearly salary is ridiculously high.

That's hilarious.", "And this tradition depends on your religion anyway. For example, having the bride walk down thr aisle with her father to be given away is not traditional in Catholicism. People do it because they want to but the traditional way is for her to walk down alone because husband and wife give themselves to each other. Even during the wedding, the bride and groom face each other (and not the alter) because they are giving the sacrament to each other, not to God. God is just blessing it.", "But an engagement ring is a symbol of the woman belonging to the man. Why do you think men don't wear engagement rings but women do? In fact in some ancient societies women wore little keys attached to their engagement rings to show they belong to their husband.", ">She didn\u2019t refuse walking herself down the aisle, just to someone else (probably her dad) walking her down and giving her to her husband-to-be. \n\nand she's perfectly willing to ruin OP's longlife association to their wedding by not doing what OP wants. Shame on her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It\u2019s a man-to-man property exchange and is totally understandable she doesn\u2019t want to participate in that.\n\nengagement rings are overpriced traditions and is totally understandable OP doesn't want to particpate in that.", "Ohhh. That makes more sense than my interpretation.\n\nFor some reason I took \"I won\u2019t argue if she takes my last name\" as a full statement. \"Sure. She can take my name if she wants. I won't complain.\"", "Honestly that is a weird assumption to make off of OP saying her doesn't care whether she takes his last name or not.  If he doesn't care about it why would he give her full naming rights of their children for her to take it?", "I don't care about naming traditions, but I would like my family to have my last name. Wife and kids included. I just through thay in there for background knowledge. We previously said we would figure out the names together and we don't always agree on everything. We make compromises. Sometimes one cares about something more then the other and it works out. Example I would prefer peanut butter and honey but I'll still eat a PB&J. The irony of a sandwich preference example isn't lost on me. \n\nWas mainly trying to point out. We have our own preferences and we will compromise over things.", "You\u2019ve basically restated their point with different words. Ok, the poors were too abused to play sexist games back then. That doesn\u2019t make the ring any less a symbol of sexist practices.", "You seem to be missing the point. That was what the original comment said, and I wasn\u2019t disagreeing. It\u2019s not that she isn\u2019t being hypocritical, it\u2019s that they BOTH are. And honestly, that\u2019s fine! Everyone tends to be a bit hypocritical. Neither OP or his gf are faultless here.", "I\u2019m going with NTA because your argument can go the opposite way. Why is she ONLY wanting to be transitional in the one area that gets her some expensive jewelry? I think the man has every right to not want to follow this particular tradition, if he also doesn\u2019t get a say in any of the other traditions that he actually wants to participate in.

It\u2019s pear shaped and the clarity is amazing.", "My engagement ring cost a few hundred dollars and was from Sears. It\u2019s a very small diamond, but it\u2019s what he could afford. He didn\u2019t want to buy one on credit. I love it.", "In the US, most people I know pay between $5,000 and $10,000 for an engagement ring and it is considered a \"normal amount\". Personally, I think it's a horrible way to spend $10k. I asked for a custom ring that ended up being about $1,000 and the agreement is that I'll be buying the wedding ring which is about $500. \n\nThis is a lot of money to me for a ring, however I don't own any special or expensive jewelry and we both agreed to spend more than we usually would because it is special to us (and I'm seriously in LOVE with this ring lol).\n\nI feel like a lot of people get carried away with the \"traditional\" expectations, and especially for rings there's a dumb worry that if it isn't expensive enough, the person doesn't love you as much. As in, he or she cares more about money than you? It's definitely dumb but sadly I think some people feel the need to show physical proof that their relationship is valid or happy. \n\nOr GF could just want a big ass, expensive ring, which sure, why not, but maybe pay for it yourself then? Can't expect OP to shell out thousands. Either way, they both need to learn how to compromise and work together...", "This was a nice anecdote until the last line.\n\nThe implication that people with large engagement rings didn\u2019t want to marry their partner is bullshit, and smacks of envy. People have different tastes, styles, and ways to spend their money.\n\nSome people\u2019s love language is gifts, giving or receiving. Further, a well made ring can cost a bit more but be built to withstand the test of time.\n\nIn EVERY engagement a person should be choosing The Person, not the ring. What a silly implication that expensive rings cannot possible go with love.", "Platinum sucks! I didn't know this till after I got mine, but it's super soft. My ring has these little side rows of diamonds and I always have to get them bent back into place because it's so soft that normal wear pushes them out of position.", "I half suspect he\u2019s fucking with her in revenge for her refusal to take his name.", "Yeah in my religion the couple walks down the aisle together holding hands. I was just pointing out that refusing to walk down the aisle and refusing to be given away are different things. Both are fine!

Everything in his post makes it seem like he does care and does want her to take his last name.", "Let me tell you something. In my culture (which can be VERY patriarchal) women don\u2019t take their husbands last name. Why? Simple reason. The woman and man are considered to be from two different families and lineages. Sure you\u2019re coming together to make a new family but even then you BOTH are leaving old life behind to be husband and wife. She alone isn\u2019t becoming a part of your family. So the whole taking your last name thing doesn\u2019t make sense.", "> I would like my family to have my last name \n\nIs it not *her* family, too? Why does your surname take precedence?", "So can you clarify the compromise that was reached on names?\n\nSome people took your OP as meaning your wife will take your name and that she'll pick your kids' first name while you chose their last name (yours). Others took your OP as meaning your wife will keep your name and name the kids too.\n\nAlso, will you truly get no say in their first name, like if she picks some ugly-ass name you'll be ok with that?", "I think the point is they both can, but the way that\u2019s shaking out for them means they\u2019re not compatible.

We don\u2019t even wear our rings anymore, and she doesn\u2019t like flowers either", "2k is actually pretty reasonable for an engagement ring.

There\u2019s already a comment here talking about a one cent ring like the couple are saints. \n\nPeople should buy what they can afford and makes sense for them as a couple. Whether that\u2019s $500 or $500K should be no indication of the love the couple has for each other, but their net worth. My engagement ring alone cost 6 figures, but I eloped at the courthouse.

OP may have a skewed perception of what tradition even is.", "Moissanite is a great alternative. It's lab created, near perfect clarity, beautiful sparkle, and one can buy a much larger stone for less. They are a 9.5 on the MOHS scale and look like a diamond unless you look at it with a microscope.", "I noticed. I also noticed how many commenters didn't see this or the other points as any concession on his behalf. \n\nShe is more than entitled to ask for the things she sees as important in accordance with her values. It's OP's job to evaluate them, see if those are acceptable and see if OP wants to marry this person. Or possibly negotiate compromises for his own values. \n\nIf one party is conceding everything to the other party, he or she is not a relationship partner, they are a doormat. That can change, but it's hard and rare. OP would be very wise to not get married until he is on the same page with his partner.
