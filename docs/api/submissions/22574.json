Why do you want to do all the traditional things which are free for you, but for the one that costs you money, suddenly tradition goes out the window?\n\nYou\u2019re not necessarily TA, I\u2019m leaning towards ESH. However, remember that she will likely be wearing that ring for the rest of her life (or at least as long as you\u2019re married).\n\nDo you really want her lifelong associations with that ring to be an argument about how you wouldn\u2019t get her the one she wanted?\n\nThere are wider issues here, though. It seems you\u2019re both bad at compromising (e.g., giving one partner full authority to decide the kids\u2019 names), which can lead to an unhealthy relationship.", "ESH\n\nIt's a bit difficult to judge overall because you don't really say what you see as \"expensive\" vs \"cheap\", and what she's asking for may not be completely unreasonable. However, based on the information we've been given, neither one of you looks great.\n\nYou're right that she's being a hypocrite (and therefore an AH) by insisting on a double standard, where \"tradition\" is only important or even acceptable to her when it works in her favour. When it doesn't - with last names, baby names, wedding traditions - she's all in on calling it misogynistic. When it gets her expensive jewelry, suddenly it's not only not anti-feminist, it's DEEPLY IMPORTANT. \n\nTo be clear, there's nothing wrong with her not wanting a cheap engagement ring. In fact, where YOU are a bit of an AH is in considering that this isn't just about \"tradition\" but the fact that this is a piece of jewelry that she's hopefully going to be wearing every day for the rest of her life. So yeah, you're a bit of an AH for \"wanting to get a cheap engagement ring\". I would think that for something that's meant to represent your love, that she's going to wear daily for decades, and that's usually nicer and more elaborate than the wedding ring (which is usually a fairly simple band), you would want to at least splurge a LITTLE, even if you don't want to spend an unreasonable amount. Saying that you literally want to get one that's \"cheap\" (rather than saying that you'd rather not spend more than you can reasonably afford) is gross. \n\nSo ESH. Her for double standards and not being willing to compromise, and you for not even trying to find a reasonable middle ground either, and admitting that you want to be \"cheap\" about something meaningful that's meant to represent your love.

There are two?! I never knew lol.\n\nIt sounds like you know nothing about rings at this point. That is perfectly fine since you are still a year out from getting engaged but it means that you're going off assumptions and making firm decisions and getting into arguments about it before even having the facts. Your first step should not be to turn to Reddit to assign blame; it should be to inform yourself and talk with your girlfriend.\n\nIt's not clear from your post what is happening (Is she actually demanding a mined diamond? Is she demanding a certain, excessive price point? Does she just want quality material and craftsmanship? Are you being cheap? What's the cost vs your income vs other discretionary spending? etc) and I suspect it's because you yourself don't actually have a clear picture. Makes it hard to judge.\n\nEven your agreement on the names is unclear.\n\n> She now says it's the traditional thing to do and will send me videos that try and justify it.\n\nWhile it's actually perfectly fine to pick and choose (refusing tradition means refusing to be bound by tradition, not mindlessly doing the contrary of tradition for the sake of being anti-traditional) and it's ok for her to want a nice ring within reason, it's not OK to want a modern relationship but then use tradition to push your partner to do things they don't want. \n\nAnd who argues by sending their partner videos instead of explaining your position and your you feel, listening to understand where they come from, and striving to find a solution that works for both of you, compromising if need be?\n\nIt's hard to judge with the little you provided but based on that, ESH, your girlfriend more than you. \n\nAs an aside, are you sure your values, outlook on life, etc align?", "ESH you two sound completely incompatible and that\u2019s even with missing information on both sides\u2026 you should just break up.", "NTA..if she's shunning all other traditions why not this one?

The engagement ring is the one that traditionally has the big fancy diamond everyone focuses on. The wedding ring is usually a simpler band (think more along the lines of a man's traditional wedding ring) and that is what you'd put on her finger at the alter. Most places will sell you the engagement and wedding rings as a pair, but the wedding rings usually aren't that expensive since they usually don't have large or intricate stone work.

The ring, more than the other traditions you named, seems to be more about symbolizing commitment than erasing a woman's autonomy. \n\nThat being said... there are good reasons to avoid diamonds (generally unethical, artificially inflated value), and I'm fairly sure that the gifting of jewelry originates in a need for portable wealth, in case you're stuck fleeing a war, or in dowry traditions... neither of these deserve much respect these days. \n\nSo yeah, I feel like if she gets to make ethical arguments against tradition so do you, and I think that the evidence is on your side.", "I agree with shedding tradition.

The modern engagement ring actually started as a bit of a reaction to the misogynistic power imbalance in dating and marriage, as a form of insurance for jilted women, and has since become its own thing.\n\nPersonally I agree with you, it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of money on an engagement ring. But she has told you that a nice ring matters to her. So you need to negotiate. Is it the price tag that attracts her and repels you? Or is it that it is a piece of jewellery she will be expected to wear nearly every day for the rest of her life, and she wants it to be something she enjoys wearing? You two need to sit down and negotiate this.\n\nFyi, since engagement rings have very low resale value, there are ways to save significantly on the cost.

And for high earners, there are diminishing returns, so while many people with means will splurge, most won't go as high as 3 months salary (a 5.000 ring is going to be miles better than a 1$ vending machine ring but a 25K ring won't provide the same added value compared to a 20K one).\n\nFun fact: men who shop for engagement rings with their partner tend to spend less than those who shop alone.", "6 THOUSAND????\n\nMy absolute jesus", "My friend engagement ring cost 1 cent, it was from one those machine and plastic, she has had it since 1969, still wear it for fine occasions in a string around her neck. \n\nIn her case , she wanted the person not the  ring.", "I have lab created diamond rings.

I also couldn\u2019t justify spending that much MORE in comparison. \n\nBut for some, they DO believe in the cultural traditions, origins, sentiments with mined  ones.", "Holy shit, you spent 9000 quid on your rings, and you think that\u2019s the norm? I didn\u2019t get an engagement ring, because it would have meant delaying the wedding, and which would have doubled our overall cost. I just replaced my wedding over 20 years later for $400. \n\nWe celebrate our 22nd anniversary on Friday. Obviously, not having an engagement ring isn\u2019t fatal. Granted, OP is just trying to teach his girlfriend a lesson, which could be fatal to their relationship.

This book also popularized the myth that the ring finger had a vane that connected right to the heart.\n\nBut yes, the tradition did take a big hit during world War 1 and was repopularized by De Beers in the 1930s.\n\nEdit: Greece not Egypt", "Women did work for centuries but, at least in most European countries, any income she earned was automatically her husband's property. \n\nThere was one particularly egregious divorce case in 19th c England where a couple got married, but before long the man abandoned his wife.

That's it. That's the origin. A depression/WWII era marketing campaign.", "You said the other stuff was sexist, but an engagement ring was not.

Take good stones from crap piece, put on good piece with crap stones.\n\nBut OP, yeah. Dude needs to talk this out. If she wants to go non-trad on everything that benefits her, and ultra-trad on stuff that does costs him, that can be fine but needs to be talked out. There is no right or wrong to any relationship as long as it's even to both partners. Everyone has their own things they value. \n\nRegardless of any relationship, traditional or not, one partner should not be making ALL of the compromises. OP needs to sit down and look over what he's being asked to do, what he's asking her to do, and seeing how well the two line up. Dude needs to put a lot of thought into stuff he might consider small, but she might consider big. \n\nRelationships are built on compromises, preferably healthy ones.

Not wedding bands, engagement rings that cost 20k USD.  I just about keeled over at this cost.  The wedding bands pushed it over 30k.  These were people in their early 20s... I have no idea how the guys afforded it.  The men's wedding band was not cheap either.", "This is so lovely and sentimental.\n\nHonestly it's each to their own with the jewellery. I would have been happy with a cheap ring but he wanted to go big and I'm not complaining we work hard for what we have for me it was the commitment more than anything.

There's no choice between a person and a ring, and people who get a fancy ring didn't want their spouse any less.\n\nRealistically and logically, a ring costs money, so the choice is between that and spending that money on something else or saving it or having to save for longer or getting into debt (a very bad choice) or working more hours or other financial alternatives. \n\nAnd I say this as someone who didn't even want my husband to spend a cent on a ring for me.", "don't you dare come on this sub with facts, accurate information and logic, we gonna downvote you!", "I never said it was going to change his mind I was merely trying to give an opinion and on what happened to us.

Though they did have contracts as far as property was concerned.", "Engagement or betrothal as a state has been around for a long time. The ring? Not so much.\n\nIf you've ever read Don Quixote, so many of the subplots revolve around engagement. In 16th-century Spain, at least, as soon as a couple were engaged (*before* they were married) it was socially and religiously acceptable for them to have sex - because engagement was considered a personally and legally binding state. But, as you can imagine, many men enjoyed the sex, and then had second thoughts, leaving behind a pregnant, unmarried woman. *Because there was no ring or any other physical sign of the betrothal*, they could deny that they made any promises of marriage to the woman. The men were legally and socially in the wrong, but if they were well-positioned, they could brazen it out. Several of Don Quixote's hapless exploits are intended to win back the honor of abandoned women, and compel the men to marry them - as they were legally and morally required to do.", "My response was specifically to the comment of \"before women were allowed to have jobs\", is the thing.

Those were your words, my dear. Let's not project onto others. My exact words were that the relationship seemed \"one-sided,\" as in one person is being selfish and demanding while compromising nothing for the other.
