It was their thing to do together!* Her getting the cooking gear is entirely appropriate and will mean far more to her, who *used* these things with her *father* than to you who only want them as mementos. (If that. From the tone of your post it sounds like you just want the stuff). Good on your MIL for thoughtfully giving her daughter things that will mean so much to her and carry so many good memories of her father.\n\nAlso, berating you SIL three weeks after *her father died* and demanding she turn over her bequest to you?

The stuff was already given to his actual child, who very obviously takes precedence over you. I don't believe this has shit to do with you wanting to remember him so much as you just want that stuff. If husband was interested in it at all, that would be a little different.

They went to his daughter ffs.", "YTA- MIL is still alive and since it is all now hers she decides who gets what.  You aren\u2019t their child and their children get first dibs on anything, if FIL and SIL cooked together then she\u2019s the obvious choice to receive the cooking equipment. It sounds like you only want it because it\u2019s expensive and new because you bring it up often, what you don\u2019t do is give ANY examples of memories of using the equipment together or bonding over cooking like he and his daughter did.

Your MIL went through her deceased spouse's things and chose some things for her children that she thought would be meaningful for them. Golf clubs for your husband, presumably because he plays golf. Cooking supplies for your SIL, because as you said, she and her father loved to cook together.\n\nIt's nice if you like to cook too, but you are not one of the children. If your husband was passionate about cooking and baking, did all the cooking in your house, and loved hosting huge elaborate banquets where he was the chef, I'm guessing your MIL would have split the cooking supplies.

You wanted them because you wanted newer, more expensive kitchen equipment for your newish home. If your husband wanted some of his father's cooking equipment, then he should speak to his mum and sister. He got his golf clubs, he has something of his dad's to remember him by but if he wants more or something specific it is down to him to sort out with them.

It was their thing to do together.\n\n And you are pissed that your mother in law gave the stuff to her?!?\n\n\n Yes I get thing could of been split better.. but depending on how much those clubs are,  your immediate family could have just got a nice chunk of change there...

When it comes to dividing someone's property, a child of that person has a direct claim.  An in-law doesn't.\n2. Your MIL, the spouse of your late FIL, made a decision about dividing his personal property.  That choice is properly hers, whether she chooses to keep it or give it to a child or anything else.  \n3. You had borrowed a great deal of household goods from your husband's sister.  Then threw it out, without talking to her, even though you knew it was hers.  Borrowing someone's stuff does not give you the right to dispose of it.  You return it, unless they specifically say you can dispose of it, and you replace anything that you might have damaged.\n4. When your SIL moved back in with her parents after college, you knew it was almost certainly a temporary move. She was an adult, she was graduated, she'd be getting a job, and an apartment suitable for commute to that job, fairly soon.  Staying with the parents was a temporary home-base while job hunting, so as to not be tied to a lease if she found a job that wasn't near he apartment.  And as soon as she settled on a job and apartment, she'd obviously need her household goods back.  A \"very nice housewarming  gift\" doesn't replace an apartment's worth of usable household goods.  \n5. When you got rid of all her household goods, it meant that SIL had to replace them all at once, which is a major expense, as opposed to gradually upgrading them to nicer versions.  So she wound up having to buy everything cheap, again, to just get the basics, rather than having the basics and getting nicer ones as she needed them and wanted them.\n6. Since you destroyed SIL's household goods, using her father's to make it up makes sense, and undoes the effects of some of your destruction of her property.\n7. Since you've already thrown out one person's household items when you didn't want them, without discussing it with the owner or anyone else, no one is going to trust you to return FIL's nice stuff if you get tired of it, rather than dumping it when they might still want it.", "This is entitled as fuck.
