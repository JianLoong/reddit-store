(If that. From the tone of your post it sounds like you just want the stuff). Good on your MIL for thoughtfully giving her daughter things that will mean so much to her and carry so many good memories of her father.\n\nAlso, berating you SIL three weeks after *her father died* and demanding she turn over her bequest to you?

The stuff was already given to his actual child, who very obviously takes precedence over you. I don't believe this has shit to do with you wanting to remember him so much as you just want that stuff. If husband was interested in it at all, that would be a little different. That text you sent to SIL was ridiculous and manipulative as fuck.", "YTA.  How entitled are you?  They went to his daughter ffs.", "YTA- MIL is still alive and since it is all now hers she decides who gets what.  You aren\u2019t their child and their children get first dibs on anything, if FIL and SIL cooked together then she\u2019s the obvious choice to receive the cooking equipment. It sounds like you only want it because it\u2019s expensive and new because you bring it up often, what you don\u2019t do is give ANY examples of memories of using the equipment together or bonding over cooking like he and his daughter did.

Your MIL went through her deceased spouse's things and chose some things for her children that she thought would be meaningful for them. Golf clubs for your husband, presumably because he plays golf. Cooking supplies for your SIL, because as you said, she and her father loved to cook together.\n\nIt's nice if you like to cook too, but you are not one of the children. If your husband was passionate about cooking and baking, did all the cooking in your house, and loved hosting huge elaborate banquets where he was the chef, I'm guessing your MIL would have split the cooking supplies.

She apologised multiple times and you kept pushing and then went on to ask the SIL.\n\nIt isn't the fact you want to remember FIL or else you would have moved on to requesting something else that you could have had to remind you of him in your home. You wanted them because you wanted newer, more expensive kitchen equipment for your newish home. If your husband wanted some of his father's cooking equipment, then he should speak to his mum and sister. He got his golf clubs, he has something of his dad's to remember him by but if he wants more or something specific it is down to him to sort out with them.

It was their thing to do together.\n\n And you are pissed that your mother in law gave the stuff to her?!?\n\n\n Yes I get thing could of been split better.. but depending on how much those clubs are,  your immediate family could have just got a nice chunk of change there...

When it comes to dividing someone's property, a child of that person has a direct claim.  An in-law doesn't.\n2. Your MIL, the spouse of your late FIL, made a decision about dividing his personal property.  That choice is properly hers, whether she chooses to keep it or give it to a child or anything else.  \n3. You had borrowed a great deal of household goods from your husband's sister.  Then threw it out, without talking to her, even though you knew it was hers.  Borrowing someone's stuff does not give you the right to dispose of it.  You return it, unless they specifically say you can dispose of it, and you replace anything that you might have damaged.\n4. When your SIL moved back in with her parents after college, you knew it was almost certainly a temporary move. She was an adult, she was graduated, she'd be getting a job, and an apartment suitable for commute to that job, fairly soon.  Staying with the parents was a temporary home-base while job hunting, so as to not be tied to a lease if she found a job that wasn't near he apartment.  And as soon as she settled on a job and apartment, she'd obviously need her household goods back.  A \"very nice housewarming  gift\" doesn't replace an apartment's worth of usable household goods.  \n5. When you got rid of all her household goods, it meant that SIL had to replace them all at once, which is a major expense, as opposed to gradually upgrading them to nicer versions.  So she wound up having to buy everything cheap, again, to just get the basics, rather than having the basics and getting nicer ones as she needed them and wanted them.\n6. Since you destroyed SIL's household goods, using her father's to make it up makes sense, and undoes the effects of some of your destruction of her property.\n7. Since you've already thrown out one person's household items when you didn't want them, without discussing it with the owner or anyone else, no one is going to trust you to return FIL's nice stuff if you get tired of it, rather than dumping it when they might still want it.", "This is entitled as fuck.

And mil was his wife. You are an outsider and have  room to question ANYTHING.\n\nMil could have kept it if she wanted.\n\nDon't act like a vulture circling over a carcass.", "YTA. Your SIL and your FIL cooked together, this was their thing. She is not someobe who eats ta k eout all dsy and would never use the stuff.\n\nAnd even if she WAS someone who never cooked and never used the stuff, it's not cool to nag your very suddenly and recently widowed MIL to give them to YOU. She is still reeling from her husband's death.\n\nSave some money and get the equipment you want", "YT major A. This woman's husband just died. Her daughter just lost her father.\n\nOn top of it they have to deal with your greedy, wedeling ass? I'd never speak to you again.", "YTA, OP.  I inherited all of my MIL's kitchen equipment - mainly because we took care of her in her home for several years before she passed from Alzheimer's.   The first thing I did was offer everything to her kids and grandkids as THEY were her family long before I was.  Other than a few crystal and silver serving pieces, no one took much, and I am now the very proud and grateful owner of lots of vintage Fire-King and Pyrex as well as a few well-seasoned cast-iron skillets.  Sounds like the SIL/daughter actually had a history of using these items with her Dad.  Back off with the greed.", "YTA. Think about it this way: \n\nyour MIL gave your FIL\u2019s son (your husband) his golf clubs. \nyour MIL also gave your FIL\u2019s daughter (your SIL) his cookware. \n\nwhile you and your FIL may have been close, his biological children get first priority. your husband *wanted* golf clubs and he got them. your SIL *needed* cookware ~~because you had thrown her old cookware out~~ so she got them. \n\ni\u2019m struggling to figure out where you fit into that picture since it mostly sounds like you want the cookware more than your husband. and the real nail in the coffin is if you hadn\u2019t thrown the old cookware away, the chances that you would have gotten some of FIL\u2019s cookware would have been higher than it is now. sometimes, we really shoot ourselves in the foot. better luck next time!", "I\u2019d agree with OP if it was just asking for something to remember him by while cooking but DEMANDING something \u2026 nope, she\u2019s TAH. At this point, it\u2019s best to do as her husband advised and just drop it \u2014 continuing to pursue the matter is just going to piss everyone off.", "YTA. You are not entitled to any of that unless he left it to you specifically. As much as I have wanted  keepsakes or mementos from close relatives who have passed away, I have never asked because, in my opinion, it's rude. When i have been given items, I am grateful for what was chosen to be given to me, and i cherish them. They are going through so much already, and  to go so far as to text your SIL and just start drama, geeeeeezus, give it a rest.", "You are harassing a grieving widow just so you can flex with expensive equipment. YTA", "YTA even for the way you laid into your MIL. Daughter and father enjoyed cooking together so it makes sense that her mother gave those things to her. Hubby got his golf clubs. That too makes sense. That's all.", "Why would you think asking and then doubling down was a good idea? YTA.", "YTA. It's not your dad. Leave it alone. It's important during this difficult time to remember FIL was not your dad. Your husband, his siblings and his mom will sort it out. Keep your distance.", "You are consistently inconsiderate lol YTa", "Reread the title you gave this post. You\u2019re the AH, you\u2019re selfish, you don\u2019t get to demand anything.", "Lol what the shit? Stop drooling over your dead in-laws possessions. YTA and greedy and entitled on top", "You were an asshole without the backstory, but reading that made it worse. \n\nYTA, leave your poor SIL alone. She just lost her dad and doesn't need this BS.", "YTA", "YTA. Jesus Christ you're not entitled to anything. The woman's husband has died and you're demanding she takes something of his from his daughter???????", "She repeats it at least three times throughout the post, trying her best to convince us and herself of the \u201cmemories\u201d of FIL. Transparent.\n\nWhenever one borrows something, even if it was rundown to begin with, gets good use out of it and then no longer needs it, it\u2019s always best to ask the original owner if they would like it back out of courtesy. It\u2019s good manners, so YTA just for that.", "Not to mention, MIL just lost her husband! And you\u2019re in her ear buzzing about his cooking supplies?! YTA", "Notice she only wants the really good stuff? There\u2019s probably non fancy stuff still knocking around that she could \u2018cook Christmas dinner with\u2019 but she just wants the pro chef supplies. Vile.", "Actually I would think his widow is actually first in line, given that those items are part of her household. She\u2019s being very generous in giving the equipment to her daughter. There\u2019s no reason why she should pass along so much as a teaspoon from her kitchen to OP.", "I wanted my gran\u2019s cookbook. It\u2019s a basic store bought book, but we used to bake together out of it and it has her notes on the recipes. It\u2019s now 70 years old and is in bits but I still use that cookbook and it makes me smile", "When my great aunt passed I asked for one painting and all of her jelly jars. The jelly jars are our drinking glasses now. :) Also have a pretty spoon that was made into a bracelet.", "I have one of my grandma's paintings framed in my room :)", "That\u2019s where hers is. :) I can go to sleep looking at it. It\u2019s a somewhat abstract painting of a lion on a piece of uneven wood. A bit odd but I always loved it. Used to sit on the basement steps and look at her paintings while I played with their cats as a kiddo. Brings back really great memories.", "Especially since she\u2019s the IN-LAW! When my MIL passed, I didn\u2019t think it appropriate to ask or expect any of her things. They should go to her children & grandchildren first & foremost.", "I had to double check as I was reading it - like, when I read SIL I was like \"so are both OP and SIL the DILs of the deaseased?\" and then I realised, no, both children of the just passed away dad are getting mementos (with the golf clubs going to OP's husband), but OP wants to take away her SIL's mementos of her recently passed dad, because they're expensive. The daughter is the one who used to do all the cooking with her father, there's no indication OP ever cooked with her FIL, so why would she assume it should be split 50/50? Gross."]}
