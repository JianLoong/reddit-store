It was their thing to do together!* Her getting the cooking gear is entirely appropriate and will mean far more to her, who *used* these things with her *father* than to you who only want them as mementos. (If that. From the tone of your post it sounds like you just want the stuff). Good on your MIL for thoughtfully giving her daughter things that will mean so much to her and carry so many good memories of her father.\n\nAlso, berating you SIL three weeks after *her father died* and demanding she turn over her bequest to you?

The stuff was already given to his actual child, who very obviously takes precedence over you. I don't believe this has shit to do with you wanting to remember him so much as you just want that stuff. If husband was interested in it at all, that would be a little different. That text you sent to SIL was ridiculous and manipulative as fuck.", "YTA.  How entitled are you?  They went to his daughter ffs.", "YTA- MIL is still alive and since it is all now hers she decides who gets what.  You aren\u2019t their child and their children get first dibs on anything, if FIL and SIL cooked together then she\u2019s the obvious choice to receive the cooking equipment. It sounds like you only want it because it\u2019s expensive and new because you bring it up often, what you don\u2019t do is give ANY examples of memories of using the equipment together or bonding over cooking like he and his daughter did.

Your MIL went through her deceased spouse's things and chose some things for her children that she thought would be meaningful for them. Golf clubs for your husband, presumably because he plays golf. Cooking supplies for your SIL, because as you said, she and her father loved to cook together.\n\nIt's nice if you like to cook too, but you are not one of the children. If your husband was passionate about cooking and baking, did all the cooking in your house, and loved hosting huge elaborate banquets where he was the chef, I'm guessing your MIL would have split the cooking supplies.

You wanted them because you wanted newer, more expensive kitchen equipment for your newish home. If your husband wanted some of his father's cooking equipment, then he should speak to his mum and sister. He got his golf clubs, he has something of his dad's to remember him by but if he wants more or something specific it is down to him to sort out with them.

It was their thing to do together.\n\n And you are pissed that your mother in law gave the stuff to her?!?\n\n\n Yes I get thing could of been split better.. but depending on how much those clubs are,  your immediate family could have just got a nice chunk of change there...

When it comes to dividing someone's property, a child of that person has a direct claim.  An in-law doesn't.\n2. Your MIL, the spouse of your late FIL, made a decision about dividing his personal property.  That choice is properly hers, whether she chooses to keep it or give it to a child or anything else.  \n3. You had borrowed a great deal of household goods from your husband's sister.  Then threw it out, without talking to her, even though you knew it was hers.  Borrowing someone's stuff does not give you the right to dispose of it.  You return it, unless they specifically say you can dispose of it, and you replace anything that you might have damaged.\n4. When your SIL moved back in with her parents after college, you knew it was almost certainly a temporary move. She was an adult, she was graduated, she'd be getting a job, and an apartment suitable for commute to that job, fairly soon.  Staying with the parents was a temporary home-base while job hunting, so as to not be tied to a lease if she found a job that wasn't near he apartment.  And as soon as she settled on a job and apartment, she'd obviously need her household goods back.  A \"very nice housewarming  gift\" doesn't replace an apartment's worth of usable household goods.  \n5. When you got rid of all her household goods, it meant that SIL had to replace them all at once, which is a major expense, as opposed to gradually upgrading them to nicer versions.  So she wound up having to buy everything cheap, again, to just get the basics, rather than having the basics and getting nicer ones as she needed them and wanted them.\n6. Since you destroyed SIL's household goods, using her father's to make it up makes sense, and undoes the effects of some of your destruction of her property.\n7. Since you've already thrown out one person's household items when you didn't want them, without discussing it with the owner or anyone else, no one is going to trust you to return FIL's nice stuff if you get tired of it, rather than dumping it when they might still want it.", "This is entitled as fuck.

It's not a reason to give it OP over SIL.", "OP is the easiest YTA I\u2019ve seen in awhile. I\u2019m betting OP didn\u2019t even have a cooking relationship with FIL and is 100% just greedy", "Nailed it. /thread", "Yeah, done and finished. !answered this thread can be closed lol.", "And she already STOLE sil's kitchen stuff once, just to throw it in the trash!", " I would not have been as nice as MIL.", "Plus the last time OP stole sil's kitchen supplies she threw them all out, why would they ever give her anything else?", "Shortly after my father died, I received a package from his widow that had a number of things she felt would have sentimental value to me. No amount of money could have replaced that.", "I have half a suspicion from the way OP phrases it, that they didn't even ask SIL if they could have her college cookware, just made the assumption that it was \"going spare\". And yes, then even more rude for them not to return it with thanks but just chucking it out.", "Your comment posted three times.", "I would concur with the \"not part of the convo\" part. One can have a good connection with her FIL. But she should get out of the convo right after MIL said no.", "The song got things. Should the sister have gotten half the golf clubs OPs husband got? He didn\u2019t seem to split his half. The mother did split things, OP just doesn\u2019t agree with the split but guess what he wasn\u2019t her dad. So her thoughts don\u2019t matter. And her husband told her to drop it so she should.", "I\u2019m confused at how the SIL & MIL suck? Genuinely tho, I hope that didn\u2019t come off as rude or anything! \ud83d\ude05", "I do too. I have a small baking dish which belonged my grandma, and when I cook lasagne in it I think of her and how she was always asking about whether I was eating enough.", "I mean, I do. My kitchen equipment heirlooms are some of my most treasured items. Especially the potato masher. \n\nBut that's not what's happening here and she's the AH.", "I understand. My grandma recently passed and I also had one thing I really wanted (an embroidery she made). But obviously, if my grandfather had said no, that would have been the end of it.", "Thanks for letting me know! Fixing it.", "Yes. She should have received half unless she\u2019s not interested and agreed to something else in whole. \n\nI agree OP needs to stay out of it.", "For SIL, OP said SIL left her old stuff behind but then got upset when OP threw them away. Dick move expecting other people to keep your things in a place that isn't yours anymore without at least asking.\n\nI don't think MIL sucks, but my comment was already pretty long.", "I do too think about the people who passed me the things I use to coo while using them, but OP was trying making it sound like the family would remember the FIL through the thought of her using his supplies to make the food they'd be eating, which is delusional.", "My point is less about the prople making it, and more about the people eating the meal; I imagine everytime you smash a potato in it you remember of your family, but the people eating the smashed potato (I suspect) wouldn't. But I agree, that's not the main point.", "My grandmother had a set of Royal Doulton figurines that she let me play with - very carefully - when I was a little girl. Before she passed, she gave them to me because she knew how special they were to me.", "\ud83d\ude0a", "OP never said she left  it behind.  OP said she had a ton left over from her college apartment which her and husband took than threw out when they got new stuff.  \n\nOP should have asked if SIL wanted it back instead of tossing it. \n\nThe SIL is not an AH.", "I totally see where you\u2019re coming from! I think I only differed because it didn\u2019t seem to me like the SIL gave permission for her things to be used, just that OP took them to use", "Ah yea, I misread that. SIL not an ah\n\nEh so really, I change my ESH to YTA."]}
