Even before that she hated my mom. When my mom got pregnant my grandmother wanted a boy, so she was immediately disappointed when I was born a girl. She even called me the wrong name my whole life because she wanted the \u201cItalian version\u201d instead.\n\nShe would do subtle things to let me know she didn\u2019t like me. I have 2 sisters (different moms) whom she LOVES and she would give them iPods for xmas while I got clothes that didn\u2019t fit. She would take them out but she wouldn\u2019t even call me on my birthday. By the time I was 15 I told her that I felt unloved and she said \u201cyour parents are together so you have enough love. Your sisters need more.\u201d So to me that was that. I continued to act happy anytime I saw her at family events to keep the peace and she continued to ignore me.\n\nEventually I met my now husband who helped me realized how wrongly I was treated. So I decided to set boundaries in my life. I told my parents I would go LC with my grandmother and to respect it. My parents understood & even apologized for allowing this to go on my whole life. \n\nIn 2021 I was getting married and my dad begged me to invite her. I did but I didn\u2019t invite my aunt (her daughter) so she called me and said \u201cthe day you were born ruined the family\u201d honestly I was almost relieved to hear this because I knew it was truly how she felt but she never said it before so now I didn\u2019t feel crazy. After this I went NC with her.\n\nJanuary 2022 I found out I was pregnant. Life has been wonderful to me honestly and I feel very happy with my grandmother out of my life. My dad continues a relationship with her (just phone calls now and then) which is fine because it\u2019s his mother, but no one has pressured me to speak to her. Eventually she found out I was pregnant and started calling my dad asking when she could meet her one and only great grandchild. My dad explained to her she would never get to meet him. \n\nThen my dad found out she was sick. She has dementia and aphasia and doesn\u2019t look like she will make it long. Once my son was born my dad told me that my grandmother keeps calling him saying how she wants to meet the baby. She ended up calling me but I ignored and she left a voicemail begging me to bring my son over to meet her. My husband encouraged me to stick to my boundaries and not let it happen.\n\nLast week my dad went to see her for the first time in person since before my wedding and he called me afterwards nearly in tears. He said his mother is dying and all she wants is to meet her great grandson. Of course I felt bad because I have a heart lol, but I really don\u2019t want to visit her. My dad is now asking me to consider seeing her even if it\u2019s just for an hour so she can meet the baby. I really want to refuse but he has me wondering AITA for not letting a sick woman meet her great grandson?", "created_utc": 1671891341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuao7b/aita_for_not_letting_my_grandmother_meet_my_baby/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your dad she had years to fix the relationship. She doesn't earn back points for being on death's doorstep. I guarantee that there will be some underhanded comment while you are there. \"At least it's a boy this time\" or some shit. Let her die sad, she didn't mind being emotionally abusive to a child.", "NTA. It sounds like she disrespected you your whole life. Old and sick aren\u2019t conditions to get what you want after a lifetime of mistreatment towards others", "NTA. My heart hurts for the child you were, but I'm glad you are happy now. Grandma is reaping what she sowed\ud83e\udd37", "NTA. Send her a picture. \n\nOP, I'm sorry you've had to go through all of that.\nYou are torn between honoring your father's request to honor your grandmother's request and keeping your distance. You don't want you or your child to be around your grandparent at all.\n\nI would write a decent letter to your grandma about how she treated you and how you have felt over the years. I would detail every incident that stands out in your mind. I would then tell her to break the curse of hating your own family members for being born stops with yourself, and that you're not passing it on to your child. Then write within the letter, forgive her for hating you for being born (if you can; it's good for your soul and mental health) and tell her the picture is all she can have of your child and to not ask again to see your child in person. Your dad will probably be the one to read it to her, and he will also have a full understanding if he doesn't already.", "Just like a hot tip: my adoptive father has vascular dementia and is also dying from it and he can be nasty, violent, and abusive when he doesn\u2019t get his way. It could be something as little as I watched a tiktok and he doesn\u2019t like that I\u2019m laughing without him and doesn\u2019t understand if I show him. I would not recommend seeing her but if you must find out her good hours and do not even consider going anytime after 4, sundowning is real and it sucks.", "Stand your ground. Your father failed you by not protecting you, and now he\u2019s asking you to let your grandmother walk all over you again. It would also set a precedent if your baby getting thrown under the bus for adults to play happy families. Your grandmother isn\u2019t apologizing, proving she hasn\u2019t changed. Finally, consider the possibility she wants to see your baby to insult her - there\u2019s only one generation in the family she hasn\u2019t mistreated.", "NTA. I wouldn't bring my baby around someone who told me I ruined the family when I was born.  She can die the way she lived. \n\nDoes your father know she said that to you?", "NTA- IMO your dad should have done more to shield you from that toxicity as a child. Coming close to death isn\u2019t a get out of jail free card, especially as it sounds like she hasn\u2019t done any apologizing or admitted any level of being wrong. Let your dad know how happy you are for him to be in your son\u2019s life and show compassion for his pain. You went NC with grandma for incredibly strong reasons and after much abuse.", "That's really a tough one, since your grandma doesn't have much time. Of course I understand your frustration towards her, and you might feel hurt again if you introduce your son to her. I can't really make a decision for you. If it's only to meet the grandma for only one hour, it's ok for you to go. It's only one hour. Then you can go back to no contact with her.", "NTA. Your grandmother is reaping what she sowed. You aren't an incubator for her great grandchild, she has no right to expect anything from you.", "NTA , your dad had years to address her behaviour and has no right to try to guilt you now.", "NTA. It\u2019s sad she\u2019s dying but that does not negate the lifetime of hate she treated you with. She is not entitled to meet your baby and you know what they say, you reap what you sow.

Hellllllll noooooo that woman does NOT have any right see that precious baby.", "NTA, stick to your guns, she deserves nothing from you and just maybe as she passes, she might realize the consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\nYou know the answer to this: defo do NOT take your son to her! She doesn't deserve to meet him, after the way she treated you and the things she told you! If she had acted like a grandmother you and had been nice, sure, why not? After all that? Why would you take him to her? Nah, stick to your guns! It's like you said, you've been much happier w/o her in your life, why bring her into it again, even if briefly? She'll probably even say something like \"Of course you produced such an ugly baby\" or whatever, just to make you feel bad!\n\nShe can't use your son to redeem herself or toe have another opportunity to make you feel bad!\n\nCongrats on your baby, I am certain he's super cute :)\n\nStay happy and free of toxicityyyyy.... bye", "NTA but your dad is for pushing you to do it! Stand your ground she did it to herself. You know what they say about karma.......", "NTA!!\nShe said your birth ruined the family. Thats INSANE to say! You do not owe her shit.\n\nIf you want to do it for your dad you could give him your baby to babysit (he visits his mom with the baby) and go treat yourself well. Like shopping or something you enjoy. Being a new mom can be stressful. Maybe you can use it to your advantage. The baby will need to be fed soon after i guess. So your dad has to bring him back to you anyway. \nBut there is no need to do so. Your life, your baby.", "NTA  You grandmother is an A H.  Her dementia and aphasia have no bearing on that.  She treated you shitty your whole life, and you're under no obligation to fulfill her wish to meet a great-grandchild.  Actions have consequences, and in this case it's not a one-off action, but a lifetime's worth of actions. \n\nYou're well within your rights to refuse, and I don't think you should give it a second's thought or feel any remorse about it.  Your grandmother never did.", "NTA and whatever you choose to do is 100% acceptable, if it was only for your grandmother then I would say leave her and continue no contact, but this is obviously effecting your father, would you consider letting him and your husband take the baby to see her for an hour and you staying away?", "NTA for either choice you make.  Maybe go with your father and stay in car for an hour while he takes in baby for an hour, but let him know exactly, x amount of time.", "NTA. My family has a similar situation with my brother, although he isn\u2019t dying. I assume.", "NTA\n\nSick or not, your grandmother still hates you with a passion. Do you really want to reintroduce such toxicity into your family's life?", "You are NTA because of the way you were hurt.\n\nHaving said that, you clearly love your father and this is extremely important to him. We are often prepared to do more for people at the ends of their lives, especially if they are distressed \n\nWould it hurt you or your baby to spend an hour with your grandmother, despite the way she treated you, to give your father some peace and possibly even joy at a very difficult time?", "NTA. You went NC for many good reasons. Family needs to respect the boundaries you set.", "I have a huge soft spot for elderly people, but absolutely not you are NTA. \n\nShe treated you horrifically your whole life and has made everything about herself and her perspective of how YOUR life should be and the choices you should make, as well as how you should feel. You do not owe her anything. \n\nThis is her last grasp at the power she holds over you and she knows it. Not that your baby would even remember the meeting but given her track record it would likely be fake/ unpleasant for you and I don\u2019t think you would gain any closure. \n\nI\u2019m glad your parents are typically understanding if you wanting limited contact, it just seems your dad is dealing with a lot so I give him a little grace.", "NTA. How much do you want to bet the old hag would have nothing to do with you if the baby was a girl, seeing as that was her whole excuse for being an abusive witch your entire life. Protect your son the way your parents failed to protect you and if your Dad keeps giving you crap, ask him where his empathy was when his mother was abusing you for years without consequence?", "NTA please don\u2019t cave and do it", "Nta\nDon't you dare cave in", "NTA! you need to protect yourself first and foremost and it doesn't sound like she has changed her ways at all! cut her out of your life if at all possible, you do not need that toxicity.", "Right!!? She'll defo have one last dig at OP for sure....", "My thoughts exactly! People keep saying \u201cit\u2019s just one hour.\u201d But you know it\u2019s going to be an hour of passive aggressive comments and snide remarks. \u201cYou finally did something useful\u2026\u201d \n\nOP doesn\u2019t deserve that, and elderly or not, no one is owed seeing another person\u2019s child.", "Maybe it's because I'm biaised and I have a similar story regarding my parents, but that one hour might be enough to destroy OP's balance! It might bring joy to her father but I am also certain that grandmother could also use that as an opportunity to belittle and insult OP one. last. time!! \n\nMy mother got to meet her grandson before we went NC with her due to some things that came to light afterwards, but my sperm donour hasn't met him and never will. If I get a call that he's dying and he wishes to see his \"grandson\" I'm gonna laugh down that phone call, hang up and be at peace, but that's me.....", "This.  \n\nNTA. Stick to your boundaries.", "OP should show up without the baby just to deliver the message in person that grandma is never going to meet OP's kid.", "I can only imagine the anxiety this would bring OP! One hour of that to \"keep the peace\" or to bring HER FATHER some peace **shouldn't** be grounds for OP to lose HER peace.....\n\nI understand where your sentiment is coming from but after what we read on this post, would you still put yourself through something like that? Her father can definitely find joy in his grandson\n\nEdit for small correction", "What?!? No! The woman doesn't deserve that and the dad is going to have to realize that! Hell would freeze over before I ever spoke to my mother again and I wouldn't care who called begging! She does not OWE anything to her abuser! And yes the grandmother mentally and emotionally abused her! Just like I don't owe my abuser anything! You wouldn't tell her to go talk to a man who beat her would you? No? This is literally no different! The women has karma visiting and it's her own fault", "I dunno, why didn't her father stick up for her during her life? If one of my parents treated one of my kids that way I'm not so sure if be crying and crying that my parents couldn't meet my grandkid.", "Wth?! No! Her dad allowed years of emotional abuse from the grandmother to happen. The father nor the grandmother are owed any type of kindness. They have zero right to request anything. OP\u2019s dad needs to be protecting her. End of story. \n\nAlso, of the grandmother has dementia and aphasia, she might not even remember meeting the baby. It\u2019s a useless gesture that could traumatize OP more.", "Her dad already got his one \"comprise\" at the wedding and it backfired exactly how OP thought it would. He ran out of compromises."]}
