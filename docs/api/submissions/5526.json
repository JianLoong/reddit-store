Even before that she hated my mom. When my mom got pregnant my grandmother wanted a boy, so she was immediately disappointed when I was born a girl. She even called me the wrong name my whole life because she wanted the \u201cItalian version\u201d instead.\n\nShe would do subtle things to let me know she didn\u2019t like me. I have 2 sisters (different moms) whom she LOVES and she would give them iPods for xmas while I got clothes that didn\u2019t fit. She would take them out but she wouldn\u2019t even call me on my birthday. By the time I was 15 I told her that I felt unloved and she said \u201cyour parents are together so you have enough love. Your sisters need more.\u201d So to me that was that. I continued to act happy anytime I saw her at family events to keep the peace and she continued to ignore me.\n\nEventually I met my now husband who helped me realized how wrongly I was treated. So I decided to set boundaries in my life. I told my parents I would go LC with my grandmother and to respect it. My parents understood & even apologized for allowing this to go on my whole life. \n\nIn 2021 I was getting married and my dad begged me to invite her. I did but I didn\u2019t invite my aunt (her daughter) so she called me and said \u201cthe day you were born ruined the family\u201d honestly I was almost relieved to hear this because I knew it was truly how she felt but she never said it before so now I didn\u2019t feel crazy. After this I went NC with her.\n\nJanuary 2022 I found out I was pregnant. Life has been wonderful to me honestly and I feel very happy with my grandmother out of my life. My dad continues a relationship with her (just phone calls now and then) which is fine because it\u2019s his mother, but no one has pressured me to speak to her. Eventually she found out I was pregnant and started calling my dad asking when she could meet her one and only great grandchild. My dad explained to her she would never get to meet him. \n\nThen my dad found out she was sick. She has dementia and aphasia and doesn\u2019t look like she will make it long. Once my son was born my dad told me that my grandmother keeps calling him saying how she wants to meet the baby. She ended up calling me but I ignored and she left a voicemail begging me to bring my son over to meet her. My husband encouraged me to stick to my boundaries and not let it happen.\n\nLast week my dad went to see her for the first time in person since before my wedding and he called me afterwards nearly in tears. He said his mother is dying and all she wants is to meet her great grandson. Of course I felt bad because I have a heart lol, but I really don\u2019t want to visit her. My dad is now asking me to consider seeing her even if it\u2019s just for an hour so she can meet the baby. I really want to refuse but he has me wondering AITA for not letting a sick woman meet her great grandson?", "created_utc": 1671891341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuao7b/aita_for_not_letting_my_grandmother_meet_my_baby/", "score": 427, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then write within the letter, forgive her for hating you for being born (if you can; it's good for your soul and mental health) and tell her the picture is all she can have of your child and to not ask again to see your child in person.

Why would you take him to her? Nah, stick to your guns! It's like you said, you've been much happier w/o her in your life, why bring her into it again, even if briefly?

You do not owe her shit.\n\nIf you want to do it for your dad you could give him your baby to babysit (he visits his mom with the baby) and go treat yourself well.

Your grandmother never did.", "NTA and whatever you choose to do is 100% acceptable, if it was only for your grandmother then I would say leave her and continue no contact, but this is obviously effecting your father, would you consider letting him and your husband take the baby to see her for an hour and you staying away?", "NTA for either choice you make.

She\u2019d lie to my mom that I was making fun of her. All sorts of bs. All of this because she hated me dad. I mean honestly he deserved to be hated, but I did nothing wrong. Any little thing I did she\u2019d say I was just like my dad and this is me as young as 5 and 6 being compared to the man who regular abused my mother.

I'm not her granddaughter and my son isn't her great grandson.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. You have to do what YOU want. She has been an awful grandmother and well, person to you your entire life.

The only thing I will say is if this decision is going to keep your brain stewing at night 5 or 10 years down the road then let your dad take your kid for an hour visit. Sometimes you do shit you hate to unburden your brain.  I tell you this from the experience of far too many sleepless nights.", "NTA , do not feel bad and do not let your father pressure you!

She hasn't apologized for her treatment of you even though she's dying, and she never will.  Taking your son to meet her will end up being another stab in the heart because I suspect she'll be horrid to you to the bitter end. You don't owe her a damned thing.", "NTA at all. However, if not doing this will cause you to feel guilty after she\u2019s gone, maybe just do a video call to keep you and your son safe? You will know that she got to meet him and therefore won\u2019t be guilted about not giving her her \u201cdying wish\u201d or whatever, but you will have kept your space and maintained some kind of boundaries.

She never treated you like part of the family and even told you the day you were born ruined the family.  She has no right to you or your son.  She brought this on herself.  Call her and remind her that your birth ruined the family, and just because she's dying, it gives her no right to see you or your child.  I'm curious as to whether or not your father knows about the \"ruined the family\" comment.", "NTA. And I wonder if your child was a girl if she would be so desperate to meet.", "NTA. I have no idea why her dying suddenly means she gets whatever she wants. She hasn\u2019t changed.", "NTA. Age and the end of life doesn't suddenly transform an evil crone into a sweet grandma. Don't pollute your precious baby memories with this. She's stolen enough joy from your life.", "NTA. Don't do it! She will die in peace, and you will regret it your whole life!

With the way she treated you no contact is the best thing. She doesn't get to shun you for your entire life, then demand to meet your child. She isn't owed access to your baby. No one is.", "NTA, your father is telling you that he thinks of you right now as an incubator, and given how he's fought against you trying to create boundaries for years, he was always against you. Honestly given that he's been pressuring you for so long, it says he didn't mean the apology. Perhaps this is the time to no longer have contact with your father.", "NTA\n\nWe have to remember this grandmother is dad\u2019s mother and he likely has his own trauma and now trying to work through the idea of losing her .\n\nThat being said, you owe your grandmother nothing and neither does your child. \n\nI\u2019d tell dad I understand his grief is causing conflicting emotions but knowing what it is like to be a child in grandmother\u2019s circle, you will not provide grandmother access to your own child.", "NTA. You owe your dad nothing as well. He let this go on and forced you to see her, take her abuse with a smile and forced you to invite her to your wedding. This is as much your dad's fault as your grandmother's. Don't let him guilt trip you again. The estrangement is his fault for not protecting you when he was supposed to. Be better than him. Protect yourself and your child.", "NTA.  She was horrible to you your whole life and he allowed it.  Your dad is lucky you still have a relationship with him for his lack of protection of you as a child from her behavior.\n\nAlso, I suspect her HAVING to meet your LO is because LO is a son.", "OP, you sound like a really good person. You have a good heart. You didn't deserve the treatment your grandmother dished out to you. If you don't let her meet her only great-grandchild, you won't be the a******. And I wouldn't blame you.
