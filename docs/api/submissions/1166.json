My parents had said since the beginning that they'd pay for flights and a rental home, until yesterday, at least. The trip is a week long. I found out a few weeks ago that I'd be starting a new job, and wouldn't be able to take off the full week, so I asked if I'd be able to just fly out on the Friday of that week and stay through the weekend, so I'd get to meet our relative. My mom said no at first \"because that's a waste for such a short amount of time\". Then she changed her mind and said that she wanted me to be there. My mom let me know that she had purchased \"their\" tickets, meaning her's, my dad's, grandma's and my adult sister's along with one of her friends. She asked me to look for my flights. I found them and managed to find flights that were close to $180 cheaper than theirs. I asked when we should book them. I was given a tirade by her about how I was \"selfish\" and \"an asshole for even imagining they were going to pay for my ticket\"... if you weren't paying for my ticket, why'd you say \"no\" about me going for 3 days if you weren't paying? I'm a grown ass adult and if you weren't planning on paying for my ticket what made you think you were able to tell me I couldn't spend my own money to go? \n    It gets better. I found out that she paid for my sister's friend to go. I've kept my cool through this, and honestly it wouldn't have been a big deal if they'd said from the beginning they weren't paying for my flight, I would have already said I wouldn't be able to go because I don't want to spend that money currently as I'm working on a vintage RV to hit the road in and travel full time, that's my first and only priority currently. I also spent a not insignificant amount of time unemployed and hunting for a remote job. Now that I say I'm not going, she is guilt tripping me about it and has told me to ask my grandma to pay for it. I'm not comfortable with that, and I'm not even upset about not going. It's par for the course at this point as the last several years, they have planned entire family holiday trips without my input and then let me know the dates, knowing full well I wouldn't be able to make them due to work. So am I the asshole for assuming that my flight would be covered when that was the conversation from the beginning?\n\nEdited to add: they've now asked me to care for their 5 horses and dog for free while they're gone. A job they normally pay someone $400 a week to handle while they're traveling. Not. Fucking.

Why would she assume you want to spend money and take time off from a new job to meet them?  If she wants you to meet them, she should\u2019ve bought your ticket.  Save your money.", "NTA Why would your mother pay for your sister\u2019s ticket and her friends, but not yours? Why would she chastise you for not staying the whole time, when she wasn\u2019t paying for the damn ticket? Is she controlling of your sister? This sounds like a hot mess.

Stay home and let them learn a lesson.", "NTA in any way at all.\n\nI do think you should tell your mother in no uncertain terms that you CAN afford the tickets but at this time you are NOT going for your own reasons. \n\nI will say that it is very typical in these family holiday vacation scenarios, that the planner (your mom in this case) is trying to please a diverse group of people with different demands and it can be impossibly stressful.  I'm guessing your sister told her flat out she would only go if she could bring her friend. And maybe your dad set a firm budget which means she has to get you to pay your own way.", "100% this ^^^ I\u2019d ask your mother why you have less value in her eyes then her sister\u2019s friend to the family?", "That's not the case in the slightest. This is my mom's trip from top to bottom, she has made zero concessions to anyone else about what they might want to do. She offered from the start to have my sister take a friend, they do on every vacation. My parents aren't strapped for cash at all. There's no firm budget, and the home they are renting is... expensive, to say the least. They have the funds to pay for the entirety of the trip. This is an issue that my mom has with me, specifically, for a reason that I do not know."]}
