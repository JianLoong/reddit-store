They love him but I'm the one they've bonded with there most. Sounds like Willie already likes him and his request that you be standoffish to your cat sucks. Cats typically bond to one person and that person for Willie is you .", "Only Willie can decide who Willie loves. NTA.", "NTA. Cats decide by themselves who they like. And that can also change with time.\n\nMy cats trust my bf sooo much more after 1,5 years, 2 months of this living together. Your bf doesnt need to be desperate about this - what for anyway?", "NTA. Your boyfriend sounds ridiculously insecure. It's obvious the cat likes him just fine.", "NTA but sounds like your cat chose right", "NAH. I don't think your boyfriend quite understands feline behavior, though. Cats pick a person, sometimes to the point of imprinting. Unless you die, Willie will always go to you first.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is jealous of your cat. Or maybe he\u2019s jealous of you? I can\u2019t tell because what he\u2019s asking of you of just so weird.", "Awww, this is kind of a sweet argument! NAH, but I'm having the same problem. I brought my kitty home, she bonded with me, sleeps with me, follows me like a lost duckling. \n BUT if I'm out of town for a few days, she's right on roommates lap for naps. They know what's up!\n\nAlso, CAT TAX!", "NTA - he is your cat at the end of the day, he has bonded with both of you, but he just likes you more (rightly so, as he is yours), cats pick favourites, you can't change that without being cruel, which is obviously out of the question. Your boyfriend is being a little petty over a non issue.", "NTA. Your BF is being insecure and ridiculous but he is also showing his inexperience with cats with his request. If Willie were a dog this type of ask might make a positive difference for your bf without negatively impacting your relationship with Willie. Again, if he were a DOG. Tell him that cats can\u2019t be manipulated like dogs and if he wants cuddles from your cat he has to be patient and wait for the cat to want that too.", "Pets pick their people and Willie has chosen you.  Your BF is petty AF.  Is this how he will act with children?", "NTA. Your boyfriend should be embarrassed of his request. It\u2019s completely ridiculous to expect you to redirect your cat so he\u2019ll be better bonded to your boyfriend. Yikes.", "NTA, but honestly, your bf's demand and reaction is highly concerning.", "NAH. Your boyfriend seems a little dramatic being worried about who the cat loves more, but neither of you are inherently wrong for anything you\u2019re doing. Maybe make a compromise and get him a pet fully of his own since you have a pet of your own? Of course you guys are both caring for the pet a bit, but him wanting to feel loved by your cat isn\u2019t bad and maybe if he had a pet that he could cuddle with when you\u2019re cuddling up with yours, he\u2019d feel a bit better.", "NTA - Your BF is the asshole in this low stakes fight.  Our cat perfers me over my wife but she would never tell me to be mean so that our cat would like her more.  Also food doesn't always matter to cats, my wife usually feeds her and giver her treats all the time, while I'm still the prefered nap place when we're relaxing on the couch.", "NTA but is your boyfriend for real? What an absolutely bizarre and embarrassing request. Don't push your cat away. If your cat wants to snuggle you...snuggle him. If he wants to snuggle the bf he will. Maybe don't rough house so much with him if he'd rather him snuggle than play with him. This request just smh honestly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t actually think his idea would work anyway - like you say, I think it would just make your cat think you don\u2019t want him to cuddle with you.", "NTA. Cats choose their people not the other way around.  Our youngest likes me but LOVES my husband.  Not a lot I can do about this, but it sucks so I understand your boyfriend\u2019s frustration.", "NTA. We have 2 cats at present, one is 11 years old, one just 5 months. They both started out preferring my husbands company, but I seem to be the preferred one now. They still like my husband and go to him occasionally. But cats do tend to choose their favourite, and there is very little you can do to change their minds. And why should you? Cats have personalities, and that is one of the reasons we like them in the first place.", "NTA. The cat isn't going to understand he's supposed to sleep near Joe if you nudge him from your pillow lol, Joe needs to get a clue about cats", "NTA. Cats securely attach to people and generally pick one person to bond with. Your cat has bonded with which makes tons of sense as you took on all responsibility. If joe wants to win Willie over with food, then he should set and alarm in the morning and get up to feed the cat. It\u2019s not your job to wake him for that. And you\u2019re right, definitely don\u2019t push your cat away just to shield joes fragile ego", "Willie has a bond with him, its just different than yours.   \nMy pets have a different bond w/me and my husband too. He is the one that spoils them with treats (every day twice a day!) so he is the one they bug when he is late to deliver. He plays tug-a-war him more because he rough-houses better than me, but I'm the one that they come to cuddle, or when the one is afraid of loud noises, etc. Not that they don't get the same attention from both of us, just sometimes they want mom instead of dad and vice versa. (I'm pretty sure human kids can be the same)", "NTA and your boyfriend doesn't really understand cats. We very regularly cat-sit various family cats, some have been visiting us for 10+ years. I'm the one at home all day AND the one feeding them, but when my partner walks in, they're climbing up his legs for Lap before he's even sat down. I just laugh. He's Preferred Person. And I can hardly argue, he's my catnip too, I just have more cool about it. (Most of the time.) Cats gonna cat. Dog Man needs to accept the Ways of the Cat.", "NTA Joe needs to journal/get therapy to figure out why he\u2019s insecure/clingy over a cat he does not own \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nGood luck", "NTA\n\nIts not actually that deep. Your bf is just really ridiculous. They play roughhouse and fetch together all the time so Willie clearly loves him.\n\nYour bf needs to understand that Willie prefers you over him and there is nothing wrong with that. He cannot force Willie to be super close with him if your bf dosent think that Willie likes him. He needs to understand that there are people or even pets that would not give their 100% interest to him or to someone else", "Cat's are usually a good judge of charater.  If my cat likes you I like you, if my cat is indifferent to you we can still be friends, but if my cat doesn't like you it's because you've got a bad vibe and I'm not going to deal with that.", "While you\u2019re completely right about the first two points, assuming he\u2019ll act this same way with children (even after clarified by OP that this whole situation is low stakes) is a huge reach", "My daughter's cat is a sweetheart who loves anyone who scratches her under the chin. Until one time when she refused to go anywhere near a cousins new boyfriend. She hissed at him. She'd never hissed at anyone, ever. So that had my suspicions up. Daughter's cat was proven correct about that *********************** person when we found out he had shaken his newborn child a decade before he met my cousin."]}
