All of my friends and I are going camping and we were planning to all match pyjamas. Two of my friends had already bought them and I went today to buy mine, only to find they were sold out. I had asked them if they minded just wearing normal pyjamas because I didn\u2019t want to feel left out as they would be matching and I wouldn\u2019t. They said that their moms had spent 20 dollars on it and they didn\u2019t want it to go to waste. I explained that they didn\u2019t have to never wear it, just for the camp. But they refused and told me that their moms bought it specifically for camp. I was a little upset and I told them but they just kept repeating themselves. They said they didn\u2019t care what I said and they were going to wear it and it was final. I was really upset and I was angry with them but now I\u2019m thinking maybe I\u2019m the one being dramatic. Can someone please let me know?
