I put my meds in one of those weekly cases and take them daily, the pill bottle with remaining pills is on my dresser in my bedroom.  Last week, after not seeing my husband for several days, due to working, he mentioned to me that he's been taking my extra meds (Adderall for those wondering). I told him those weren't extra and after looking in the bottle told him that now I didn't have enough to get me through the rest of the month. I usually only take the adderal on days I'm working, because that's when I need to be focused (hence the extra sometimes), but I've been working a ton of overtime lately to catch up on bills. So the following week, I'm back to working a ton of hours and barely being home. I go to fill my weekly med pack and the bottle of adderal is empty. I wake my husband to ask what happened. He replies that he finished them. I get upset and start yelling at him. He apologizes and says that he thought it would be ok, since I could take these (handing me my step son's medication). I am furious and explain to him that 1) I am not stealing my sons meds and 2) his meds are a different strength and long acting whereas mine are immediate release. (I do want to mention that my son just left for boot camp and won't be home for several months therefor doesnt \"need\" these). Today happens to be our anniversary and my husband is saying that I shouldn't be mad at him, he's sorry, blah blah blah. Am I being an asshole or do I have the right to be mad?
