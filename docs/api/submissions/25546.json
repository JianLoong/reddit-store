I put my meds in one of those weekly cases and take them daily, the pill bottle with remaining pills is on my dresser in my bedroom.  Last week, after not seeing my husband for several days, due to working, he mentioned to me that he's been taking my extra meds (Adderall for those wondering). I told him those weren't extra and after looking in the bottle told him that now I didn't have enough to get me through the rest of the month. I usually only take the adderal on days I'm working, because that's when I need to be focused (hence the extra sometimes), but I've been working a ton of overtime lately to catch up on bills. So the following week, I'm back to working a ton of hours and barely being home. I go to fill my weekly med pack and the bottle of adderal is empty. I wake my husband to ask what happened. He replies that he finished them. I get upset and start yelling at him. He apologizes and says that he thought it would be ok, since I could take these (handing me my step son's medication). I am furious and explain to him that 1) I am not stealing my sons meds and 2) his meds are a different strength and long acting whereas mine are immediate release. (I do want to mention that my son just left for boot camp and won't be home for several months therefor doesnt \"need\" these). Today happens to be our anniversary and my husband is saying that I shouldn't be mad at him, he's sorry, blah blah blah. Am I being an asshole or do I have the right to be mad?

I know some people that don't have ADHD or epilepsy will take Adderall as a \"boost\" for studying and stuff  but if that's what he needed he could've taken the extended release.

He\u2019s putting you at risk, consistently, for years. Two years ago he wanted you to rearrange the entire household schedule so he didn\u2019t have to take public transportation after his DUI. Now he\u2019s stealing your (heavily regulated) medication that you need to focus while people\u2019s lives are in your hands\u2014 solely because he wants to get high. Presumably he\u2019s doing that while you\u2019re at work, which is even more of an insult. \n\nYou now have to choose between going to work\u2014 caring for patients\u2014 without medication that you need to maintain focus, for *sixteen hour shifts* or reporting your meds stolen so you can replace the prescription.

You report that bottle stolen too? At some point, you wouldn\u2019t be able to get your medication anymore. Ever. Then what? Eventually he is absolutely going to bring something into your home that\u2019s either illegal to begin with, or heavily controlled and prescribed to someone who doesn\u2019t live in your house\u2014 either purchased or stolen or purchased from someone who stole it. You think he\u2019s going to be cautious and discreet about that? He\u2019ll do his best to hide it from you, but you see how long he was able to do that. He got caught for DUI more than once; if he starts using illegal drugs, sooner or later he\u2019ll get caught with those, too. Do you want it to be in your house? \n\nYou know this is where it\u2019s headed. Two years ago you were concerned that he was still drinking after multiple DUIs.

Here\u2019s the thing, what he\u2019ll do without you is eventually what he\u2019ll do *to* you, as the person who keeps enabling him at the risk of her own well-being. He\u2019s going to destroy your life. He shows no sign of wanting to change, which means he\u2019s going to keep seeking a new high. Your license is at risk as long as you stay with someone who shows every indication that he will bring whatever substance he can get his hands on into your house. When the prescription is gone, or no longer does enough for him, he\u2019s going to need something else. How will he pay for it? Where will he use it? Where will he keep it when he isn\u2019t using it? Will he drive to get it? Will he use some before he drives home?

Think about what that would look like. What kind of work will you do if you lose your license? What kind of place do you think you could afford to live in? If he\u2019s still with you, how much will he spend on his addiction while you\u2019re at that job? Decide now how much you\u2019ll let him have of you before you take care of yourself.
