As it\u2019s s small company, we\u2019ve often been invited to holiday parties, events, etc. There we met our daughter\u2019s colleague \u201cGreg\u201d (30 at the time of passing). We also met his wife, \u201cNancy\u201d and their daughter \u201cBrooke\u201d. We knew Luna and Greg were close friends as they worked on the same team that often traveled locally. \n\nIn March, Luna told us that Greg was diagnosed with terminal cancer. We immediately reached out to Nancy to offer support. She informed us they were separated. I was surprised but didn\u2019t pry. We offered her support which she rebuffed, but I didn\u2019t find that weird as we weren\u2019t close.\n\nIn May, Luna  came clean. She and Greg had carried on a 3 year affair. Looking back, clues were there but I never connected them. She said he separated from Nancy right after his diagnosis. \n\nI admit we were all pretty ashamed of her. She was raised better than to carry on a relationship with a married man. Still, we didn\u2019t tell her this and offered her support , as well as Greg in his final  weeks. He passed over the summer .\n\nBecause they never divorced and Greg never changed his policy, Nancy was the beneficiary of his life insurance. The rest of his assets were put in a trust for Brooke when she becomes of age. Outside a few sentimental items, Luna was left nothing. She has complained consistently that Nancy should\u2019ve given her some of the policy.\n\nLuna and Brooke also developed a bond. After Greg\u2019s passing, however, Nancy cut off all contact. This has been hard on Luna. On top of that, she was not included in the obituary and was heavily ignored at the funeral. We\u2019ve been sympathetic and supportive. \n\nOur extended family, however, isn\u2019t. They are also ashamed of Luna and feel the above are the breaks when you\u2019re the mistress. Out of both sides of our family, only myself, my husband and one of our other children (out of 3) attended the services. My MIL was cheated on by her first husband and so many feel for Nancy vs Luna. Luna has made it clear she\u2019s unhappy.\n\nThanksgiving came around. We went to my MIL\u2019s. There were some there who hadn\u2019t seen Luna in awhile. None brought up Greg. She started on not getting anything from the life insurance and not seeing Brooke. One of my nieces said \u201cYou had no rights as the mistress.\u201d Luna left in tears and I followed, giving her a hug. She asked why others are so mean and I said she can\u2019t expect them to have empathy for this situation. That she hid this for a few years, was the other woman and given her father\u2019s family history with cheating, it\u2019s a sensitive issue.\n\nShe got upset with me and left. She later texted that we\u2019ve all betrayed her.

If you act like a side piece, you have all the legal rights of a side piece: none. Expecting people not to call you out for this bonkers. Trust me, if my husband fucked around and then died, I would take extreme good pleasure in telling the side piece exactly how much money she wasn\u2019t getting (once I\u2019d confirmed the legalities with a lawyer, of course).\n\nETA: this is what people don\u2019t realize about marriage: it\u2019s fundamentally a contract. Your spouse and children have contractual rights based on that relationship. The government and the legal system give exactly two shits about looooove and soul mates.\n\nETA2: Thanks for the awards!

The consequences of my own actions.", "NTA, and Luna is definitely TA. To carry on about how she should have gotten some of the life insurance of her late affair partner is so self-centered it\u2019s unbelievable. Life insurance is supposed to help pay expenses that the deceased no longer can, and the person who now has to bear those expenses is Nancy, not Luna.\n\nUnbelievably crass of her to have gone after her affair partner\u2019s widow, who she knew, for the money the widow needs to help raise their daughter. Even people who might not be judgmental about the affair would be very judgmental about her greed.", "NTA.  Okay, let\u2019s pretend for the sake of argument Luna *was* wronged.  Does she really think the rest of the family wants to spend Thanksgiving listening to her complain about life insurance no one at the table can do a damn thing to help her obtain, let alone at that exact moment?  If she refuses to pull her head out of her ass and recognize she is not the only person in the world whose thoughts and feelings matter, you probably need to be a bit less passively supportive and a bit more forthcoming with the tough love.", "NTA\n\nBack in my day we called these \"homewreckers\"\n\nImagine the entitlement of expecting you'd get part of the life insurance policy. Taking it right out of the hands and mouths of his surviving spouse and *child*.\n\nI'm kind of surprised she's still employed there after something like that. Zero integrity.", "NTA. Ironic that she\u2019s upset at being \u201cbetrayed\u201d.", "NTA. \n\nI know you love your daughter, but gosh she is a pretty abhorrent person. First, she carries on an affair with a married man. Then, after he dies, she whinges, repeatedly, about not getting a cash payout from his death! \nI detest cheaters. But the entitled attitude towards life insurance is even more despicable! His family, his 'wife' and child, were the ONLY ones who should get anything. He had a responsibility to provide for them. And for your daughter to continually complain about this paints her as a heartless shrew. \n\nYou are a good person that you can offer support to your daughter because you love her. But honestly, I feel like this is one of those situations where she needs a slap on the backside and the truth laid bare to her that she has been and is continuing to be an absolute selfcenter AH, who is going to end up bitter and lonely and hated if she doesn't get her act together and quit with this whinny entitled behaviour. She needs a wake up call. She obviously has no idea of the gravity of her behaviours. She certainly demonstrates no remorse. She seems to have a very narcissistic veiw of the entire situation, where she thinks, and tries to convince others, that she is somehow the victim. \n\nGosh, I would be so ashamed if any of my kids behaved like this. You must be a saint to deal with this so patiently.", ">She asked why others are so mean and I said she can\u2019t expect them to have empathy for this situation.

You also gave her a possible reason for your family's reaction (history of cheating in the family). Although she may be angry at you after hearing what you said, hopefully she will realize that you are just trying to help her.", "NTA. It is time for Luna to accept the fact that a married man's side piece isn't going to be a beneficiary, be entitled to his stuff or especially, be included in the obituary (how would that even be worded- \"Greg is survived by his wife Nancy and his affair partner Luna\").  And what did she expect at the funeral...to be treated as a grieving widow?  Luna gave the dance and now it's time to pay the fiddler.", "NTA that daughter of yours sounds like a real piece of work though", "NTA. Why in the world did she think she'd be getting anything. She was his mistress, not his wife.", "NTA, Luna needs to learn there are consequences to her actions. And while it's true it takes 2 to tango and normally both Greg and her should be forced to face them, unfortunately for her she is the only one left alive to face said consequences. Her entitled behaviour is only making her look worse in a situation where she is ALREADY the bad guy. She is just going to have to accept the fact that if Greg planned on leaving anything to her he WOULD have. As someone who works for a law firm that specializes in Wills and Estates, I can tell you when it's important, people find the time to update things.", "NTA she\u2019s an adult & knew having that affair was wrong that\u2019s why she decided to hide it from you & the family. She knows how the family sees cheating & regards cheaters so no sympathy. \n\nShe\u2019s the mistress & she got what all mistresses get NOTHING!!! She can\u2019t be surprised & if she is frankly she\u2019s an idiot. She helped break up a marriage & made Brooke only have a part time father for his last days. Just because she had a relationship with her when she was with her father doesn\u2019t mean that her mother is responsible for keeping that relationship & I wouldn\u2019t allow my child to be around a woman with such lose morals & has no problem breaking up a family. The fact that Greg never changed his will or divorced Nancy shows he probably had remorse & wanted to make it up to her somehow if only monetary. \n\nBut OP you\u2019re the AH for not holding your adult daughter accountable for her actions & coddling her to make her feel better about being a home wrecker. She needs therapy so she can understand she doesn\u2019t deserve sympathy or empathy from anyone because she put herself into her situation.", "NTA. I\u2019m trying to imagine having the audacity to demand a cut of the life insurance policy of the person I was having an affair with. I honestly am surprised she decided to show her face at the funeral, and that Nancy didn\u2019t throw her out.\n\nYou handled this well and balanced being frank with her with showing parental support.", "NTA but your daughter, a cheater, feeling she has been betrayed is rich.", "You all betrayed her? How exactly did you do that? You\u2019re all holding her accountable for her actions, and she can\u2019t face the facts. \n\nShe and Greg betrayed Nancy and Brooke by carrying on an affair. She wasn\u2019t his legal wife, and has no claim to his money or a relationship with his daughter. The fact she expected Nancy to give her part of the policy needed to care for their daughter, and continue to allow her to see her, says a lot about her as a person. Her entitlement and delusion about what she did is alarming.\n\nThe policy went to the rightful person. It\u2019s Nancy and Brooke\u2019s money. She is not entitled to that, or a relationship with a child that is not hers. Maybe she would have been his wife and Brooke\u2019s stepmom. She\u2019ll never know, and like you, I have my doubts about Greg\u2019s true intentions. \n\nNTA. \n\nI hope your daughter learns from this, and makes better choices moving forward.", "NTA and while it is absurd that she thinks she is entitled to anything, she did suffer through the death of someone she loved. Please help her get a good counselor who will help her process her grief and also help her not see herself as a victim.", "NtA. At all. While Luna is experiencing a loss, folks who don't agree with her having a relationship with a married man and then WHINING ABOUT NOT GETTING MONEY when he died are perfectly reasonable. Also I'm struggling to understand why she feels lien she should get money (if he wanted he to have any he would've changed his will) and why she thought it was a good idea to bring this up over Thanksgiving.", "NTA, but whew, Luna sure is. The fact that she thought she should get some of the money, is unbelievable. She\u2019s got some nerve.", "NTA but you should tell her to leave that man's wife alone. I'd be a little more harsh in my delivery", "NTA, she can\u2019t really expect anyone to sympathize in this situation. She\u2019s not the one who made vows, but she knowingly was with a married man so she has to see why people are upset. Why does she keep bringing this up?", "NTA\n\nHow did she think this was going to play out? She was his mistress. I don\u2019t care what he told her or how much they loved each other. He stayed with his wife while cheating on her until he was diagnosed & never pursued a divorce. She is not entitled to anything. Including any sympathy from anyone. Though you seem to be doing a job of balancing this situation. Your daughter on the other hand is ridiculously entitled... why would Nancy ever allow her to see her daughter!!! WTF\n\nStrange that your daughter doesn\u2019t see the irony of saying all her family \u201cbetrayed her\u201d... must suck! Just ask Nancy bet she knows how that feels.", "NTA\n\nBig hugs to you for balancing your emotions and judgement so well. It is amazing how you've provided the support you could so far.", "NTA. She cheated knowingly and now she reaps what she has sown.

On so many levels. Of course, she is hurting. But most people feel that by having sympathy for her they are in turn condoning the relationship. The mistress and the cheating man even went so far as to allow a relationship to develop between his child and her. Wrong again on so many levels. I'm surprised she wasn't completely shunned at the services. And no way so should she receive a single dime!!  That's just abhorrent! YNTA for telling her like it is.", "NTA. Truth hurts. Your niece was right. Luna gets nothing as the mistress. She\u2019s entitled to nothing and she\u2019s the asshole for thinking she should be.", "NTA. Why do people insist on benefiting from someone\u2019s death????????", "I don't know what idiot she's hoping is going to agree with her. She wants someone to validate her bad behavior so she feels justified in it. \n\nYou are being a good father by being empathic about the passing of someone she cared about while still holding her accountable. Maybe she's having a hard time seeing through the grief. Maybe she's just a selfish ah (I'm leaning towards the latter given the levels of audacity she's expressing).\n\nEither way, you aren't the AH\n\nEdit: mom. You're a good mom lol", "NTA. You are being more than gracious with her. She has a lot of nerve complaining that she\u2019s not getting official credit for sleeping with a married man.", "NTA and you told your daughter the truth even though it was hard. Good mom. Your daughter was legally nothing to this man and he could\u2019ve taken action to change his will or life insurance beneficiary but did not. So thst should tell her everything she needs to know.", "NTA. I mean, wtf did she expect? *Of course* the daughter will get money. *Of course* the legal wife does too. *Of course* the mother has a right to keep \"the other woman\" away from her family whom she tried to destroy. \n\ndid Luna love Greg? maybe, but thats not the point here. she was not obligated in any shape or form to get something, and she's too damn old to be so ignorant of this. let her cry, she needs to grow up", "NTA. You were much more supportive of her than she had any right to expect. Why on earth does she think she should get any part of his life insurance? People have insurance policies to take care of their dependents, not to award prize money to their side piece. Even if he'd gotten divorced he would probably have been required to maintain insurance naming his (ex) spouse as beneficiary to care for their child.\n\nIt's hard to be the parent of a person who makes horrible life choices. She doesn't need her parents or her family to take her side in this. She needs to feel the effect of being wrong.", "NTA and it\u2019s odd to me that she\u2019s very focused on the money. Greg made a vow to his wife (and their family) and even if Greg was legally divorced these obligations did not end. He would have paid potentially alimony and/or child support. Rightfully his life insurance is going to his estranged wife and child. \n\nIt was also entirely possible for Greg to change who his beneficiaries were before his passing. But he did not. That\u2019s not Nancy\u2019s fault. Nancy also gets to decide who can see her child. \n\nI\u2019m sure Luna is very sad, but playing the victim in these ways does make empathy more difficult. She\u2019s behaving as if these things happened to her as opposed to consequences of her decisions.", "NTA\nThere are only two ass holes in this story one is dead.  Your daughter is the other.  You were right that she should expect no sympathy.", "NTA: she was the other women, simple as that. Yes it is a shame to lose someone you love, and or cared for. But when caring on an affair for years, you can\u2019t expect sympathy especially if you just complain you aren\u2019t getting money from the life insurance or anything after the death", " NTA. It hurts because it\u2019s true. If you don\u2019t want this kind of judgement, don\u2019t engage that type of relationship.", "NTA. So an adulterer is annoyed that the person that the person they hurt so incredibly isn't willing to give them anything? \n\nTell your daughter if she wants to ruin another relationship she should make sure he puts her in the will first.", "You\u2019re NTA, I would be more than a little ashamed. The fact that she expects to get some of his life insurance policy AND have contact with his daughter is both bizarre and outrageous. It\u2019s commendable to support your daughter through this though she is in the wrong but hot damn is she IN THE WRONG.", "ROFL\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nWhat did she actually expect? That her and her lover's wife to suddenly be best friends after she destroyed the woman's marriage during the last 3 years of her husband's life?

Has she just... never experienced consequences before?\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA\n\nAnd that is some kind of fantasy world your daughter is living in.", "NTA - she was an active participant in breaking up a marriage, so there should be no surprise that people are going to have an issue with that. You told her the truth as gently as possible.", "I'm not sure why she thought she was entitled to anything from his estate. She was the other woman, plain and simple.

Luna was a mistress, and she thinks she's entitled to her affair partner's life insurance, when he had a wife and a daughter?! This is just horrifying to me. And then for her to throw a fit about not being mentioned in the obituary?! I think you should suggest therapy, and possibly even insist on it, because Luna is being rather ridiculous. She's nearly 30 years, which makes her naive view on this whole thing and entitlement to part of his estate rather irksome to me. And the fact she brings these things up to people to try and get sympathy from them, just seems to manipulative to me. And then claiming you've all betrayed her?!\n\nTherapist, immediately. Someone needs to talk some sense into this girl or she's never going to be ready for the real world.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nWhat did she expect to happen when she had an affair with a married man?

As it\u2019s s small company, we\u2019ve often been invited to holiday parties, events, etc. There we met our daughter\u2019s colleague \u201cGreg\u201d (30 at the time of passing). We also met his wife, \u201cNancy\u201d and their daughter \u201cBrooke\u201d. We knew Luna and Greg were close friends as they worked on the same team that often traveled locally. \n\nIn March, Luna told us that Greg was diagnosed with terminal cancer. We immediately reached out to Nancy to offer support. She informed us they were separated. I was surprised but didn\u2019t pry. We offered her support which she rebuffed, but I didn\u2019t find that weird as we weren\u2019t close.\n\nIn May, Luna  came clean. She and Greg had carried on a 3 year affair. Looking back, clues were there but I never connected them. She said he separated from Nancy right after his diagnosis. \n\nI admit we were all pretty ashamed of her. She was raised better than to carry on a relationship with a married man. Still, we didn\u2019t tell her this and offered her support , as well as Greg in his final  weeks. He passed over the summer .\n\nBecause they never divorced and Greg never changed his policy, Nancy was the beneficiary of his life insurance. The rest of his assets were put in a trust for Brooke when she becomes of age. Outside a few sentimental items, Luna was left nothing. She has complained consistently that Nancy should\u2019ve given her some of the policy.\n\nLuna and Brooke also developed a bond. After Greg\u2019s passing, however, Nancy cut off all contact. This has been hard on Luna. On top of that, she was not included in the obituary and was heavily ignored at the funeral. We\u2019ve been sympathetic and supportive. \n\nOur extended family, however, isn\u2019t. They are also ashamed of Luna and feel the above are the breaks when you\u2019re the mistress. Out of both sides of our family, only myself, my husband and one of our other children (out of 3) attended the services. My MIL was cheated on by her first husband and so many feel for Nancy vs Luna. Luna has made it clear she\u2019s unhappy.\n\nThanksgiving came around. We went to my MIL\u2019s. There were some there who hadn\u2019t seen Luna in awhile. None brought up Greg. She started on not getting anything from the life insurance and not seeing Brooke. One of my nieces said \u201cYou had no rights as the mistress.\u201d Luna left in tears and I followed, giving her a hug. She asked why others are so mean and I said she can\u2019t expect them to have empathy for this situation. That she hid this for a few years, was the other woman and given her father\u2019s family history with cheating, it\u2019s a sensitive issue.\n\nShe got upset with me and left. She later texted that we\u2019ve all betrayed her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your daughter is despicable though.", "She should have taken the hint that Greg did not want her to receive any of his life insurance or he would have changed it when he separated.\n\nHe and Nancy may have separated but ultimately, she was his wife.

His conscious didn't want him to die without confessing. \n\nI feel awful for Nancy and Brooke. Yes it's painful for Luna bcause she's also lost someone who she maybe loved but at the end of the day, this is what can happen. If you play with fire, you will always get burned. \n\nNTA. She's grieving but she needs to read the room.", "Nta.....but seriously your daughter has no moral compass whatsoever....sorry she feels unsupported but as a single woman who wanted to be married this is why single women can't be friends with married couples....she makes us look like we're after someone's husband.", "NTA - It is absolutely monstrous for a mistress to expect to take money from a betrayed and bereaved wife and daughter.

In addition to everything others have said here, I\u2019ll add: Luna suffered the loss of a person she cared about very much. She was Greg\u2019s affair partner, but he was her partner in a sense. His loss has assuredly caused her trauma. Sure, that\u2019s painful. \n\nBUT she is still wildly the AH. Any valid grief she\u2019s experience does not negate the harm she caused by her affair with Greg\u2014 harm she intentionally carried out for THREE years. It is appalling that she feels entitled to a payout from Nancy, a woman who Luna knew she was inflicting deep pain on and did not care a bit. To similarly feel entitled to a relationship with Brooke, as if Luna is a step-motherly figure to this poor girl who just lost her father, is beyond disrespectful. \n\nLuna\u2019s grief is unfortunate.

Your daughter needs a major dose of reality and realize she's not Camilla Parker Bowles or Kim Zolciak.

But, my god, to insist that the wronged woman - the one responsible for launching Greg's daughter into adulthood - hand over a portion of the life insurance proceeds is some chutzpah. And to complain about it and expect her various relatives, including those with horrible previous experiences, to empathize with her over that. That is some serious self involvement. \n\nWhen my family found out what I did, they were glad that my marriage was ending, but I got no praises over how it ended. And that's how it should be.\n\nLuna right now needs to realize that (1) demanding that insurance money is taking food from the mouth of her dear Greg's child and (2) being ethical has some real world value.

Instead she comes off as a horrible, selfish, home-wrecking shrew who cares more about taking money out of the mouths of a legal spouse and child. No matter how much she \"loved\" him, she was never loved enough to properly start a relationship with and be given any benefits. Greg had all the time to do so before his terminal illness and didnt.", ">when it\u2019s important, people find the time to update things.\n\nThis.  Not an accident that Greg left Nancy as beneficiary of his life insurance.  Surprised that he didn\u2019t name his daughter as the beneficiary but maybe he was feeling guilty about the whole thing?  Yeah, not a good idea to enter into an affair with a married man.", "Yeah making the money the focus, vs the loss of his life is just gross. She\u2019s starting to realize that yeah, she got played, because even to Greg she was \u201cjust\u201d the mistress.", "I can\u2019t believe Nancy allowed her to be at the funeral.", "And regardless of the relationship between Greg and Luna, Nancy is the only one who is financially responsible for Greg\u2019s child. Luna is a single, employed, childless woman in her 20s; she doesn\u2019t need his money. The rest of Greg\u2019s assets went into a trust for his daughter when she becomes an adult. So the life insurance helps pay for his daughter\u2019s needs *right now*. How gross that Luna thinks she deserves a paycheck for being a mistress. Greg\u2019s life insurance isn\u2019t payment for a relationship, it\u2019s practical support to feed and house his child.", "It is true love right up until someone dies ... then it\u2019s a sweepstakes payout. In this case Nancy hit the jackpot & Luna got consequences.", "I agree. Sometimes people we love do bad things but I feel she's getting more support from y'all than most would give. As stated above, you told her the truth and she needed to hear it. It's pretty wild to me she's thinking she's entitled to this sympathy. NTA. Going around complaining about the money is very... not good. That really makes her look bad too.", "Don't forget that she expected a mention in his obituary. That's the part that gets me. Did she really think that his wife was going to include her in it?", "That\u2019s what I was thinking... going to the funeral!!! WHAT WHAT?!?!?!", "I agree. This whole thing speaks very poorly of Luna's character. I'm not saying she's beyond help but she needs to understand she's behaving in a very terrible way and actively work to be a better person. Her going around complaining about not getting money is baffling. Even if I was sympathetic (it is sad he died) it's WILD she's mentioning money. That would turn off any sympathy I had for her. It's also quite odd she's going around demanding sympathy from others. Does she not understand how bad it looks to break up families? I know Greg was guilty as well but what Luna is going around doing is really entitled as mentioned above and is making her look even worse.", "yep. and i think her harping on the money is more about probably feeing betrayed that he didn\u2019t leave her anything, when really he probably left the insurance money to his (soon to be ex but not anymore) wife *for* his daughter.\n\nNTA OP.", "I don't know. He left his family to be with her in his final days. That's not nothing but it also seems clear that taking care of his family financially was the priority. As it fucking should be.", "This exactly. Op\u2019s daughter wasn\u2019t nothing but the home wrecker. And truth be told he probably didn\u2019t come clean about the affair they where cought", "It sounds like he was diagnosed earlier this year, after they'd already been cheating together for 3 years, so I don't think it's that. But she has a lot of nerve to go to this widow to demand some of the money, and to stay in contact with the daughter.", "I doubt that. He was a 30 year old man with no signs of illness until earlier this year. I\u2019d understand more if he was 80 or whatever but I don\u2019t think it was initially about money.", "They probably would keep it to themselves if not her sheer AUDACITY to expect insurance money from the wife. The OP is definitely NTA! Luna needs a wake up call, she's not the victim in this situation.", "I think you missed out the part where she is now begging and is apparently fighting with the ex wife who is the mother of his children for some of his policy which I think throws her into AH territory. Dues where they are due. \n\nOverall I agree that they shouldn't be too harsh at their daughter during this grieving period it seems a bit odd to me how many times they reiterated that their family is ashamed. \n\nIt is absolutely not their place to be rooting Nancy vs Luna, they're grown adults and that is embarrassing. But OP is def NTA because they've been supportive and sympathetic towards their daughter. \n\nNTA", "She\u2019s the one who brought it up, nobody else mentioned it/ shared their judgement. I believe that the other person isn\u2019t to blame IF they were unaware of their partners relationship. In this case Luna was well aware that Grey was married with a child and still decided to be in a relationship with him. He wasn\u2019t making Luna miserable until she discovered that she wasn\u2019t in the will and he made his WIFE and in future his DAUGHTER miserable the second he ruined their marriage.", "You see, it\u2019s not that she\u2019s mourning. The family never said anything mean about the situation she was in. It was all about that she expected to get financial compensation after his passing. \n\nLuna knew what she did wasn\u2019t on the up and up as she had to confess after years about her relationship. While I strongly believe not everything is black and white and we don\u2019t have the full story (not agreeing with cheating here), the leap between understanding their love and her need for money cannot be acceptable.", "Correction: the owner of the money that she loved and wanted died.", "I mean, what's that conversation going to go like?  \n\n\"Look at all those nights you got to sleep early because I was filling in for you!\"", "Does she not realise that life insurance isn't fun money. It's money left to look after financial dependents on the event of your death. He had a daughter, and money that's gone to his wife will be to cover the daughters costs growing up. If luna cared about Brooke, like she states she does, she'd be more concerned that there is enough to provide her with a comfortable upbringing after she's lost her Dad", "Her AP could have arranged something for her prior to his death. He didn't though. And the man's wife owes her NOTHING.  NTA op. She betrayed herself. \ud83d\ude22", "Well ya... obviously cause Nancy hit the jackpot & all poor Luna got was consequences ... \n\nOMG I can\u2019t with this ... what the hell did I just read!!!! Luna is seriously delusional", "And he also didn\u2019t change his will. Which people with a terminal illness typically do. If he\u2019d wanted her to have anything, he would have made sure she did.", "If he wanted to divorce his wife during their 3 year affair, he would have. If he wanted to marry her, he would have. If he wanted to leave something for her in his will, he would have. The fact is, he did none of those things. He got what he wanted from her, and that was an affair. As mean as that sounds - that\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s fine to support your daughter and NTA for that, but I\u2019d probably be a little more blunt with her about the reality of the situation.", "Wow so Greg wanted cake and cookies and was playing both of them for a bit \ud83d\ude02 Greg was the biggest AH but it don\u2019t change the fact that your daughter knew Greg was married, does make me feel a bit for her though and I\u2019m glad youre making it clear it\u2019s not exactly her as I\u2019m sure she feels lonely- it\u2019s the fact that she did all this and hid it for 3+yrs.", "He proposed while he couldn't legally marry her. Then never actually divorced his wife or changed his will. Luna seems a bit naive.", "And he also didn\u2019t change the life insurance policy", "He had plenty of time to change his beneficiary if he really wanted. He did not.  She got what she deserved which is nothing.  His wife has to take care of her child without any help from him.", "NTA honestly it seems like y\u2019all have been too supportive in letting her bring up the inheritance. \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s probably not much and it should go to his child and the single parent who is now responsible for that child. Maybe they would have married but he still would have owed child support to Nancy. \n\nIf Luna wants to truly be in Brooke\u2019s life, is she willing to pay child support? I\u2019d bet not. \n\nI\u2019d tell Luna that she isn\u2019t owed anything and she looks like a trashball for continuing to suggest she deserves the money more than a 3 year old who will miss out on knowing her father!", "You should explain to her that (1) the Court might have required him to leave his kids other parent as the beneficiary for the good of the kids and (2) he could have taken a policy out in her name if he wanted.  NTA", "He didn't divorce his wife during the 3 year affair. He didn't change his will. It doesn't sound like he thought of her as more than his affair partner.", "He didn\u2019t divorce his wife. I wonder why. Your wife played a dumb game and lost.", "Also, who is to say it would have been hers? It might have gone completely to his daughter!", "It probably would not have been hers anyways. Oftentimes when parents divorce, they have to keep an insurance policy or their minor children for just this reason. They get a second one for their new wife/family. And a dude with terminal cancer wasn\u2019t going to get approved for a new life insurance plan. This was NEVER going to be her money. You can bet your life Nancy wouldn\u2019t have let him change the policy in the divorce. \n\nAnd honestly, that\u2019s why she got shit talked. Everyone was likely planning on being civil until she brought up her dead boyfriend\u2019s life insurance money. At the Thanksgiving dinner table.  Which may be the worst time to bring up your dead boyfriend\u2019s life insurance policy, except for at his actual funeral. And that\u2019s not even counting the fact that it was her dead MARRIED boyfriend\u2019s insurance policy and the money was going to the GRIEVING CHILD whose home she helped wreck before he died. You can\u2019t expect sensitivity when you are being actively insensitive to those around you by ruining thanksgiving dinner with your petty money complaints.", "You\u2019re mom of the year to have put this as gently as you did. I\u2019m pretty sure my mom would have said something like \u201cI\u2019m sorry honey, but you fucked around and found out\u2026\u201d", "Yea, he didn\u2019t divorce his wife on purpose\u2026 he could have if he wanted to.  He didn\u2019t because he probably felt bad about what he did and his only way to make amends was to stay married so his wife and child would get all the benefits as his widow.\n\nHe was a cheater and he told your daughter what she wanted to hear, and she believed him.\n\nYou play stupid games, you win stupid prizes.  Somehow she thought that what she was doing with a married man was ok, and she was entitled.  She needs help otherwise she will end up make a similar stupid mistake again\u2026", "Your daughter has to understand that she was simply the homewrecker. Nothing but a mistress. He never did anything to change that.", "Lol, the guy who had an affair for 3 years is a liar, big surprise", "Tell her that before her and Greg married he would have to divorce Nancy in which case Luna would have had little entitlement to assets regardless due to Greg's finances being required to support his child.", "Thanks! I am definitely middle aged, and so very, very not cool. \ud83d\ude09", "How do you keep showing up?", "Greg was married. That should have been enough.", "I\u2019m reminded of a quote from Downton Abbey \u2018you\u2019ll find that most men who carry on extra marital affairs with women will complain about horrid wives\u2019.

You can absolutely be fired for workplace misconduct for sleeping with a coworker.", ">They can't fire her for being a cheater unless they want to be sued and lose\n\ndepends on the state, marital status isn't protected under federal law and some companies have morality clauses or something similar that makes it easy to fire people for affairs/crimes/etc.", "Every state is an at will state with Montana having some minor exceptions. That means you can be fired for any reason that is not a protected status. Being a cheater is not a protected status. She very easily could be fired in all 50 states as being a cheater would likely meet the standard of good cause required in Montana. Many people are fired for workplace romances/affairs.", "It kind of makes sense, if his daughter wasn't of age yet.

YIKES!!", "\u201cHis wife, daughter and mistress will miss him terribly.\u201d", "\u201cToday we say goodbye to Greg, a loving husband, father and cheating bastard.\u201d", "For all we know, his wife kicked him out, and Luna seemed a better option than living alone. I mean, if he carried on the affair for three years without leaving and then never filed for divorce even after they separated, it doesn\u2019t sound like he was in any rush to commit to Luna.", "Or it could be knew his wife wasn\u2019t going to stand by him after the affair blew up and he needed a caretaker.", "Yeah I can't see anyone, knowing you are really/terminally ill, not wanting to be with their kid as much as possible? Why out of all the 3yrs, then?", "I hope it isn't the case but the fact that she keeps complaining about it makes it hard to not consider it that way. I'm sorry for your daughter.", "Maybe she just doesn't like how their lived reality, that the marriage was over, is not reflected officially. After a long affair and her being vulnerable cause of the death I get how that could feel invalidating", "It's a soft YTA for me because I think OP should have acknowledged that family was  being mean. But I generally agree with you", "I have never been in that situation but from what I know the cheaters lie to their affair partners and tell them they will leave their spouses... Soon. Right now is just not possible cause reasons. I don't think anyone imagines their love story as their partner being married to someone else and having to keep everything a secret.\n\nI obviously don't know any details here, but I would imagine most affair relationships like this are abusive.", "Oop, I just choked on my spit!", "Bahahaha.... this is so wrong HAHAHAHA", "100% this. I\u2019m sorry, OP, but your daughter has no right to act like an honorary wife to Greg. This isn\u2019t the 16th century French royal court, where that kind of thing was socially acceptable.  What Greg and Luna did is not okay. They carried on a 3-year affair behind everyone\u2019s backs and ruined his family. The fact Luna feels entitled to anything after the pain and destruction she caused speaks volumes for her character. NTA for standing by your daughter and telling her the truth, but Luna needs a massive wake-up call. There are consequences to her actions.\n\nEdit: clarity", "THIS", "for insurance, if it was sponsored through his work, he may not have been able to change it until either the changing benefits time or when the divorce was official (change in family circumstances is how it is worded I think)", "Agreed", "Oh trust me, I have my theories about what would\u2019ve happened had he not gotten the diagnosis. It\u2019s just a bit too suspect.", "I agree. But I don\u2019t work in that office.", "And that is soundly based on real life.", "It's not workplace misvomfivt in many places.

I\u2019m in healthcare, and I could most definitely lose my license for \u201cactivities unbecoming of the profession.\u201d What those are is at the discretion of the board that regulates me. I\u2019ve certainly heard of them taking a look at people who freak out and start randomly cursing at servers in restaurants for example. Carrying an affair \u2026 in a conservative state, yeah I could see that too.", "Oh that's interesting and a good point.", "Disagree that he meant to leave the life insurance money for his daughter.  It would be easy enough to set up a trust for his daughter with respect to the life insurance money.  But he left it solely to Nancy, his wife.  And she can spend it however way she wants.  That life insurance money was probably a sort of payoff to her for his infidelity.", "If it wasn't for the daughter the wife should have included her in the obituary.\n\n\"He will be missed most my the xxxx he was having an affair with that is now demanding payment.\"\n\nThat should make Luna happy.", "Oooh that's true.", "I wonder what she paid during his last illness.  If he was unable to work, in the middle of a divorce with confused assets, she may have been footing the rent and groceries if nothing else.  Hopefully she didn't pay any medical bills.  She screwed herself over if so.", "Ong tho I didn\u2019t quite see it this way at first but maybe your family is op", "Then she needs to keep that to herself. She can\u2019t bring it up to parties that aren\u2019t sympathetic.", "How is it mean to say that she isn't owed or entitled anything?\n\nIt's not rude to tell someone they can not have something when they keep complaining about not getting it.", "How is the family being mean? They are treating her with the same level of respect she treated Nancy and Brooke with. Luna doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with her behavior then there is obviously nothing wrong with the families. Personally I think OP is coddling Luna too much. \n\nAlso to only blame the man is extremely misogynistic. It takes two to tango and it\u2019s worse as she did it knowingly.", "Well, we don't know if it was abusive, although we can tell Greg wasn't being truthful to either side.\n\nBut it's definitely abusive to go to the funeral and interrupt the grieving of not only the wronged spouse but their child who lost time with her terminal father because of Luna.  \n\nShe can feel as sad as she wants and I'm sure she does. But she's not entitled to his money, she's not entitled to anyone's sympathy for that part of it. I'm interested that it seems that at the family gathering she didn't seem to express sorrow or missing him, but was angry about his money.", "I'm not going to make a joke about spitting instead of swallowing.\n\nI'm way too classy for that.", "There's generally no \"qualifying life event\" required to change the beneficiary on life insurance policies, even through work.\n\nThat's only for health insurance.", "For the most part, you are able to change the life insurance beneficiary whenever.
