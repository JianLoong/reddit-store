As it\u2019s s small company, we\u2019ve often been invited to holiday parties, events, etc. There we met our daughter\u2019s colleague \u201cGreg\u201d (30 at the time of passing). We also met his wife, \u201cNancy\u201d and their daughter \u201cBrooke\u201d. We knew Luna and Greg were close friends as they worked on the same team that often traveled locally. \n\nIn March, Luna told us that Greg was diagnosed with terminal cancer. We immediately reached out to Nancy to offer support. She informed us they were separated. I was surprised but didn\u2019t pry. We offered her support which she rebuffed, but I didn\u2019t find that weird as we weren\u2019t close.\n\nIn May, Luna  came clean. She and Greg had carried on a 3 year affair. Looking back, clues were there but I never connected them. She said he separated from Nancy right after his diagnosis. \n\nI admit we were all pretty ashamed of her. She was raised better than to carry on a relationship with a married man. Still, we didn\u2019t tell her this and offered her support , as well as Greg in his final  weeks. He passed over the summer .\n\nBecause they never divorced and Greg never changed his policy, Nancy was the beneficiary of his life insurance. The rest of his assets were put in a trust for Brooke when she becomes of age. Outside a few sentimental items, Luna was left nothing. She has complained consistently that Nancy should\u2019ve given her some of the policy.\n\nLuna and Brooke also developed a bond. After Greg\u2019s passing, however, Nancy cut off all contact. This has been hard on Luna. On top of that, she was not included in the obituary and was heavily ignored at the funeral. We\u2019ve been sympathetic and supportive. \n\nOur extended family, however, isn\u2019t. They are also ashamed of Luna and feel the above are the breaks when you\u2019re the mistress. Out of both sides of our family, only myself, my husband and one of our other children (out of 3) attended the services. My MIL was cheated on by her first husband and so many feel for Nancy vs Luna. Luna has made it clear she\u2019s unhappy.\n\nThanksgiving came around. We went to my MIL\u2019s. There were some there who hadn\u2019t seen Luna in awhile. None brought up Greg. She started on not getting anything from the life insurance and not seeing Brooke. One of my nieces said \u201cYou had no rights as the mistress.\u201d Luna left in tears and I followed, giving her a hug. She asked why others are so mean and I said she can\u2019t expect them to have empathy for this situation. That she hid this for a few years, was the other woman and given her father\u2019s family history with cheating, it\u2019s a sensitive issue.\n\nShe got upset with me and left. She later texted that we\u2019ve all betrayed her.

If you act like a side piece, you have all the legal rights of a side piece: none. Expecting people not to call you out for this bonkers. Trust me, if my husband fucked around and then died, I would take extreme good pleasure in telling the side piece exactly how much money she wasn\u2019t getting (once I\u2019d confirmed the legalities with a lawyer, of course).\n\nETA: this is what people don\u2019t realize about marriage: it\u2019s fundamentally a contract. Your spouse and children have contractual rights based on that relationship. The government and the legal system give exactly two shits about looooove and soul mates.\n\nETA2: Thanks for the awards!

The consequences of my own actions.", "NTA, and Luna is definitely TA. To carry on about how she should have gotten some of the life insurance of her late affair partner is so self-centered it\u2019s unbelievable. Life insurance is supposed to help pay expenses that the deceased no longer can, and the person who now has to bear those expenses is Nancy, not Luna.\n\nUnbelievably crass of her to have gone after her affair partner\u2019s widow, who she knew, for the money the widow needs to help raise their daughter. Even people who might not be judgmental about the affair would be very judgmental about her greed.", "NTA.  Okay, let\u2019s pretend for the sake of argument Luna *was* wronged.  Does she really think the rest of the family wants to spend Thanksgiving listening to her complain about life insurance no one at the table can do a damn thing to help her obtain, let alone at that exact moment?  If she refuses to pull her head out of her ass and recognize she is not the only person in the world whose thoughts and feelings matter, you probably need to be a bit less passively supportive and a bit more forthcoming with the tough love.", "NTA\n\nBack in my day we called these \"homewreckers\"\n\nImagine the entitlement of expecting you'd get part of the life insurance policy. Taking it right out of the hands and mouths of his surviving spouse and *child*.\n\nI'm kind of surprised she's still employed there after something like that. Zero integrity.", "NTA. Ironic that she\u2019s upset at being \u201cbetrayed\u201d.", "NTA. \n\nI know you love your daughter, but gosh she is a pretty abhorrent person. First, she carries on an affair with a married man. Then, after he dies, she whinges, repeatedly, about not getting a cash payout from his death! \nI detest cheaters. But the entitled attitude towards life insurance is even more despicable! His family, his 'wife' and child, were the ONLY ones who should get anything. He had a responsibility to provide for them. And for your daughter to continually complain about this paints her as a heartless shrew. \n\nYou are a good person that you can offer support to your daughter because you love her. But honestly, I feel like this is one of those situations where she needs a slap on the backside and the truth laid bare to her that she has been and is continuing to be an absolute selfcenter AH, who is going to end up bitter and lonely and hated if she doesn't get her act together and quit with this whinny entitled behaviour. She needs a wake up call. She obviously has no idea of the gravity of her behaviours. She certainly demonstrates no remorse. She seems to have a very narcissistic veiw of the entire situation, where she thinks, and tries to convince others, that she is somehow the victim. \n\nGosh, I would be so ashamed if any of my kids behaved like this. You must be a saint to deal with this so patiently.", ">She asked why others are so mean and I said she can\u2019t expect them to have empathy for this situation.

You also gave her a possible reason for your family's reaction (history of cheating in the family). Although she may be angry at you after hearing what you said, hopefully she will realize that you are just trying to help her.", "NTA. It is time for Luna to accept the fact that a married man's side piece isn't going to be a beneficiary, be entitled to his stuff or especially, be included in the obituary (how would that even be worded- \"Greg is survived by his wife Nancy and his affair partner Luna\").  And what did she expect at the funeral...to be treated as a grieving widow?  Luna gave the dance and now it's time to pay the fiddler.", "NTA that daughter of yours sounds like a real piece of work though", "NTA. Why in the world did she think she'd be getting anything. She was his mistress, not his wife.", "NTA, Luna needs to learn there are consequences to her actions. And while it's true it takes 2 to tango and normally both Greg and her should be forced to face them, unfortunately for her she is the only one left alive to face said consequences. Her entitled behaviour is only making her look worse in a situation where she is ALREADY the bad guy. She is just going to have to accept the fact that if Greg planned on leaving anything to her he WOULD have. As someone who works for a law firm that specializes in Wills and Estates, I can tell you when it's important, people find the time to update things.", "NTA she\u2019s an adult & knew having that affair was wrong that\u2019s why she decided to hide it from you & the family. She knows how the family sees cheating & regards cheaters so no sympathy. \n\nShe\u2019s the mistress & she got what all mistresses get NOTHING!!! She can\u2019t be surprised & if she is frankly she\u2019s an idiot. She helped break up a marriage & made Brooke only have a part time father for his last days. Just because she had a relationship with her when she was with her father doesn\u2019t mean that her mother is responsible for keeping that relationship & I wouldn\u2019t allow my child to be around a woman with such lose morals & has no problem breaking up a family. The fact that Greg never changed his will or divorced Nancy shows he probably had remorse & wanted to make it up to her somehow if only monetary. \n\nBut OP you\u2019re the AH for not holding your adult daughter accountable for her actions & coddling her to make her feel better about being a home wrecker. She needs therapy so she can understand she doesn\u2019t deserve sympathy or empathy from anyone because she put herself into her situation.", "NTA. I\u2019m trying to imagine having the audacity to demand a cut of the life insurance policy of the person I was having an affair with. I honestly am surprised she decided to show her face at the funeral, and that Nancy didn\u2019t throw her out.\n\nYou handled this well and balanced being frank with her with showing parental support.", "NTA but your daughter, a cheater, feeling she has been betrayed is rich.", "You all betrayed her? How exactly did you do that? You\u2019re all holding her accountable for her actions, and she can\u2019t face the facts. \n\nShe and Greg betrayed Nancy and Brooke by carrying on an affair. She wasn\u2019t his legal wife, and has no claim to his money or a relationship with his daughter. The fact she expected Nancy to give her part of the policy needed to care for their daughter, and continue to allow her to see her, says a lot about her as a person. Her entitlement and delusion about what she did is alarming.\n\nThe policy went to the rightful person. It\u2019s Nancy and Brooke\u2019s money. She is not entitled to that, or a relationship with a child that is not hers. Maybe she would have been his wife and Brooke\u2019s stepmom. She\u2019ll never know, and like you, I have my doubts about Greg\u2019s true intentions. \n\nNTA. \n\nI hope your daughter learns from this, and makes better choices moving forward.", "NTA and while it is absurd that she thinks she is entitled to anything, she did suffer through the death of someone she loved. Please help her get a good counselor who will help her process her grief and also help her not see herself as a victim.", "NtA. At all. While Luna is experiencing a loss, folks who don't agree with her having a relationship with a married man and then WHINING ABOUT NOT GETTING MONEY when he died are perfectly reasonable. Also I'm struggling to understand why she feels lien she should get money (if he wanted he to have any he would've changed his will) and why she thought it was a good idea to bring this up over Thanksgiving.", "NTA, but whew, Luna sure is. The fact that she thought she should get some of the money, is unbelievable. She\u2019s got some nerve.", "NTA but you should tell her to leave that man's wife alone. I'd be a little more harsh in my delivery", "NTA, she can\u2019t really expect anyone to sympathize in this situation. She\u2019s not the one who made vows, but she knowingly was with a married man so she has to see why people are upset. Why does she keep bringing this up?", "NTA\n\nHow did she think this was going to play out? She was his mistress. I don\u2019t care what he told her or how much they loved each other. He stayed with his wife while cheating on her until he was diagnosed & never pursued a divorce. She is not entitled to anything. Including any sympathy from anyone. Though you seem to be doing a job of balancing this situation. Your daughter on the other hand is ridiculously entitled... why would Nancy ever allow her to see her daughter!!! WTF\n\nStrange that your daughter doesn\u2019t see the irony of saying all her family \u201cbetrayed her\u201d... must suck! Just ask Nancy bet she knows how that feels.", "NTA\n\nBig hugs to you for balancing your emotions and judgement so well. It is amazing how you've provided the support you could so far.", "NTA. She cheated knowingly and now she reaps what she has sown.

On so many levels. Of course, she is hurting. But most people feel that by having sympathy for her they are in turn condoning the relationship. The mistress and the cheating man even went so far as to allow a relationship to develop between his child and her. Wrong again on so many levels. I'm surprised she wasn't completely shunned at the services. And no way so should she receive a single dime!!  That's just abhorrent! YNTA for telling her like it is.", "NTA. Truth hurts. Your niece was right. Luna gets nothing as the mistress. She\u2019s entitled to nothing and she\u2019s the asshole for thinking she should be.", "NTA. Why do people insist on benefiting from someone\u2019s death????????", "I don't know what idiot she's hoping is going to agree with her. She wants someone to validate her bad behavior so she feels justified in it. \n\nYou are being a good father by being empathic about the passing of someone she cared about while still holding her accountable. Maybe she's having a hard time seeing through the grief. Maybe she's just a selfish ah (I'm leaning towards the latter given the levels of audacity she's expressing).\n\nEither way, you aren't the AH\n\nEdit: mom. You're a good mom lol", "NTA. You are being more than gracious with her. She has a lot of nerve complaining that she\u2019s not getting official credit for sleeping with a married man.", "NTA and you told your daughter the truth even though it was hard. Good mom. Your daughter was legally nothing to this man and he could\u2019ve taken action to change his will or life insurance beneficiary but did not. So thst should tell her everything she needs to know.", "NTA. I mean, wtf did she expect? *Of course* the daughter will get money. *Of course* the legal wife does too. *Of course* the mother has a right to keep \"the other woman\" away from her family whom she tried to destroy. \n\ndid Luna love Greg? maybe, but thats not the point here. she was not obligated in any shape or form to get something, and she's too damn old to be so ignorant of this. let her cry, she needs to grow up", "NTA. You were much more supportive of her than she had any right to expect. Why on earth does she think she should get any part of his life insurance? People have insurance policies to take care of their dependents, not to award prize money to their side piece. Even if he'd gotten divorced he would probably have been required to maintain insurance naming his (ex) spouse as beneficiary to care for their child.\n\nIt's hard to be the parent of a person who makes horrible life choices. She doesn't need her parents or her family to take her side in this. She needs to feel the effect of being wrong.", "NTA and it\u2019s odd to me that she\u2019s very focused on the money. Greg made a vow to his wife (and their family) and even if Greg was legally divorced these obligations did not end. He would have paid potentially alimony and/or child support. Rightfully his life insurance is going to his estranged wife and child. \n\nIt was also entirely possible for Greg to change who his beneficiaries were before his passing. But he did not. That\u2019s not Nancy\u2019s fault. Nancy also gets to decide who can see her child. \n\nI\u2019m sure Luna is very sad, but playing the victim in these ways does make empathy more difficult. She\u2019s behaving as if these things happened to her as opposed to consequences of her decisions.", "NTA\nThere are only two ass holes in this story one is dead.  Your daughter is the other.  You were right that she should expect no sympathy.", "NTA: she was the other women, simple as that. Yes it is a shame to lose someone you love, and or cared for. But when caring on an affair for years, you can\u2019t expect sympathy especially if you just complain you aren\u2019t getting money from the life insurance or anything after the death", " NTA. It hurts because it\u2019s true. If you don\u2019t want this kind of judgement, don\u2019t engage that type of relationship.", "NTA. So an adulterer is annoyed that the person that the person they hurt so incredibly isn't willing to give them anything? \n\nTell your daughter if she wants to ruin another relationship she should make sure he puts her in the will first.", "You\u2019re NTA, I would be more than a little ashamed. The fact that she expects to get some of his life insurance policy AND have contact with his daughter is both bizarre and outrageous. It\u2019s commendable to support your daughter through this though she is in the wrong but hot damn is she IN THE WRONG.", "ROFL\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nWhat did she actually expect? That her and her lover's wife to suddenly be best friends after she destroyed the woman's marriage during the last 3 years of her husband's life?

Has she just... never experienced consequences before?\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA\n\nAnd that is some kind of fantasy world your daughter is living in.", "NTA - she was an active participant in breaking up a marriage, so there should be no surprise that people are going to have an issue with that. You told her the truth as gently as possible.", "I'm not sure why she thought she was entitled to anything from his estate. She was the other woman, plain and simple.

Luna was a mistress, and she thinks she's entitled to her affair partner's life insurance, when he had a wife and a daughter?! This is just horrifying to me. And then for her to throw a fit about not being mentioned in the obituary?! I think you should suggest therapy, and possibly even insist on it, because Luna is being rather ridiculous. She's nearly 30 years, which makes her naive view on this whole thing and entitlement to part of his estate rather irksome to me. And the fact she brings these things up to people to try and get sympathy from them, just seems to manipulative to me. And then claiming you've all betrayed her?!\n\nTherapist, immediately. Someone needs to talk some sense into this girl or she's never going to be ready for the real world.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nWhat did she expect to happen when she had an affair with a married man?

As it\u2019s s small company, we\u2019ve often been invited to holiday parties, events, etc. There we met our daughter\u2019s colleague \u201cGreg\u201d (30 at the time of passing). We also met his wife, \u201cNancy\u201d and their daughter \u201cBrooke\u201d. We knew Luna and Greg were close friends as they worked on the same team that often traveled locally. \n\nIn March, Luna told us that Greg was diagnosed with terminal cancer. We immediately reached out to Nancy to offer support. She informed us they were separated. I was surprised but didn\u2019t pry. We offered her support which she rebuffed, but I didn\u2019t find that weird as we weren\u2019t close.\n\nIn May, Luna  came clean. She and Greg had carried on a 3 year affair. Looking back, clues were there but I never connected them. She said he separated from Nancy right after his diagnosis. \n\nI admit we were all pretty ashamed of her. She was raised better than to carry on a relationship with a married man. Still, we didn\u2019t tell her this and offered her support , as well as Greg in his final  weeks. He passed over the summer .\n\nBecause they never divorced and Greg never changed his policy, Nancy was the beneficiary of his life insurance. The rest of his assets were put in a trust for Brooke when she becomes of age. Outside a few sentimental items, Luna was left nothing. She has complained consistently that Nancy should\u2019ve given her some of the policy.\n\nLuna and Brooke also developed a bond. After Greg\u2019s passing, however, Nancy cut off all contact. This has been hard on Luna. On top of that, she was not included in the obituary and was heavily ignored at the funeral. We\u2019ve been sympathetic and supportive. \n\nOur extended family, however, isn\u2019t. They are also ashamed of Luna and feel the above are the breaks when you\u2019re the mistress. Out of both sides of our family, only myself, my husband and one of our other children (out of 3) attended the services. My MIL was cheated on by her first husband and so many feel for Nancy vs Luna. Luna has made it clear she\u2019s unhappy.\n\nThanksgiving came around. We went to my MIL\u2019s. There were some there who hadn\u2019t seen Luna in awhile. None brought up Greg. She started on not getting anything from the life insurance and not seeing Brooke. One of my nieces said \u201cYou had no rights as the mistress.\u201d Luna left in tears and I followed, giving her a hug. She asked why others are so mean and I said she can\u2019t expect them to have empathy for this situation. That she hid this for a few years, was the other woman and given her father\u2019s family history with cheating, it\u2019s a sensitive issue.\n\nShe got upset with me and left. She later texted that we\u2019ve all betrayed her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your daughter is despicable though.", "She should have taken the hint that Greg did not want her to receive any of his life insurance or he would have changed it when he separated.\n\nHe and Nancy may have separated but ultimately, she was his wife.

His conscious didn't want him to die without confessing. \n\nI feel awful for Nancy and Brooke. Yes it's painful for Luna bcause she's also lost someone who she maybe loved but at the end of the day, this is what can happen. If you play with fire, you will always get burned. \n\nNTA. She's grieving but she needs to read the room.", "Nta.....but seriously your daughter has no moral compass whatsoever....sorry she feels unsupported but as a single woman who wanted to be married this is why single women can't be friends with married couples....she makes us look like we're after someone's husband.", "NTA - It is absolutely monstrous for a mistress to expect to take money from a betrayed and bereaved wife and daughter.

In addition to everything others have said here, I\u2019ll add: Luna suffered the loss of a person she cared about very much. She was Greg\u2019s affair partner, but he was her partner in a sense. His loss has assuredly caused her trauma. Sure, that\u2019s painful. \n\nBUT she is still wildly the AH. Any valid grief she\u2019s experience does not negate the harm she caused by her affair with Greg\u2014 harm she intentionally carried out for THREE years. It is appalling that she feels entitled to a payout from Nancy, a woman who Luna knew she was inflicting deep pain on and did not care a bit. To similarly feel entitled to a relationship with Brooke, as if Luna is a step-motherly figure to this poor girl who just lost her father, is beyond disrespectful. \n\nLuna\u2019s grief is unfortunate.

Your daughter needs a major dose of reality and realize she's not Camilla Parker Bowles or Kim Zolciak.

But, my god, to insist that the wronged woman - the one responsible for launching Greg's daughter into adulthood - hand over a portion of the life insurance proceeds is some chutzpah. And to complain about it and expect her various relatives, including those with horrible previous experiences, to empathize with her over that. That is some serious self involvement. \n\nWhen my family found out what I did, they were glad that my marriage was ending, but I got no praises over how it ended. And that's how it should be.\n\nLuna right now needs to realize that (1) demanding that insurance money is taking food from the mouth of her dear Greg's child and (2) being ethical has some real world value.

And it sounds like she helped care for his daughter during Greg's custody time maybe beacuse he was too ill to do so and needed someone to do the work and facilitate. So I can understand why Luna feels like at the time of Greg's death Nancy was the ex even if she was still legally his wife. And maybe feels like Nancy dosen't deserve the money when Luna did all of the caretaking through his illness.\n\nBut as others said, that is the price of being the mistress. It does sound like Luna really did love Greg, it's an impressive level of dedication to become official with someone when they get cancer and support them through all the sickness, grossness, pain, caretaking, childcare, and death. The sad thing is it dosen't sound like Greg was looking out for her back. He became official with Luna when his wife left him and he needed a caretaker for his illness. And he didn't care about leaving Luna anything, either. The fact that all his money went to his kid and not his legal wife makes me wonder if he hadn't fixed that after the separation, and just didn't tell Luna to make sure she stayed around and nursemaided him and looked after his kid while keeping him company in his dying days. He probably wanted Nancy to have the money to raise their kid with, but just choose not to let Luna know.\n\nEdit: Found in comments Greg proposed to Luna but didn't divorce Nancy. Wow, Greg really was an asshole.", "Dangit. I just had surgery. It hurts to laugh. YOU MADE ME LAUGH!!", "Or was being filled in for you.", "This is the best comment ever", "This! \ud83d\udc46! I know someone who was upset that their mother inherited the house she (the mother) and her husband (the father) lived in and bought together/", "Based off ages of adults involved Brooke is probably pretty young and was seeing Luna on dads visitation time.", "What a fucking nut", "First thing I thought of, sounds like he had months to get his end of life affairs in order, he could have changed things and added her, but he didn\u2019t , says a lot.", "This is an excellent point. OP, I hope you can relay this to  Luna. She has lost all perspective and needs to conduct herself with a little more decorum", "Isn\u2019t that the oldest lie in the book from a cheater? \u201cOh yes baby I\u2019m going to leave my partner for you. Just give me some time and I\u2019ll get rid of them and be all your\u2019s.\u201d", "Yep. It's easy to write checks you know won't be cashed in on.\n\nHonestly, I wonder if Brooke (Greg's daughter) even *wants* to see Luna anymore. I sure as hell wouldn't. This woman was having an affair with her father for years. Sometimes parents will put their foot down and cut contact and make themselves the bad guy in the situation so their child, in this case a child grieving both her father and the family life she thought she had, is shielded from the backlash. I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case, as Luna seems incredibly self centered. She wants to take money from a child whose father died, in a trust meant to help her become established as an adult, as Greg didn't live long enough to. Greg certainly isn't a prize either; he seems manipulative at best and left a ton of damage behind that Brooke will carry with her for the rest of her life", "My mom too and she would have slapped me so hard if I ever thought I was entitled to money etc.", "daughter", "His wife probably had great health insurance", "Actually they could fire her and especially if she signed a morality clause.  If it caused an issue in the job or it is a faith based company she could've absolutely gotten fired.", "Yeah, my mom and I have a great relationship and she's done a good job raising me, and if for some reason I completely lost my mind and ever did cheat on a partner, let alome pull this kind of shit, she would not be treating me with kiddie gloves and acting like I did nothing wrong. Yeah, parents don't have full responsibility for how their kids turn out, but damn, not even one negative word about her behavior? Her spoiled attitude doesn't come from nowhere for sure.", "\ud83e\udd5bNo choked!", "Greg had time to change his will and beneficiary and chose not to do so.  That\u2019s the risk Luna took here.", "yeah, Greg wasn't real clear on how this \"marriage\" thing works", "Seriously doesn\u2019t matter why he separated from Nancy. Or what Luna believes she is \u201cowed\u201d. When you love someone you do what she did without expecting compensation. \n\nIf he wanted her to have the $, he would have changed the policy. I would think he knew the $ should go to Nancy for the care of his daughter. \n\nI\u2019m sure it hurts to lose him, and his daughter, but she chose to be his mistress and has no claim on any of his estate, insurance or continued contact with his child.", "Ya sounds like Greg had the time to make arrangements for Luna and didn't. Unless there was something I missed his death wasn't sudden.", "And if I were Greg's widow? I'd sit in my bower with my Cheshire cat smile and gloat all to myself as innocent as the breeze: *I won! He died! You lost! Sucks for you!*", "I mean, I feel even in 16th century French court, there was an expectation that a man's first loyalty was to his wife.", "Did Luna come clean to you guys cuz she was caught?", "Well\nSorry he died but he was a huge AH as was your home wrecking mistress daughter .", "[removed]", "Thanks.", "Greg had time to make adjustments to his final wishes. He didn\u2019t pass away suddenly, he had time to change things. But he didn\u2019t. That should send a message to Luna loud & clear\u2026\n\nPerhaps he left everything to Nancy & Brooke as an act of atonement for betraying them. Whatever his motives were, Luna has no business in wanting more. No doubt she\u2019s hurt & mourning his passing but she absolutely should NOT be hassling Greg\u2019s widow & daughter about money, nor should she be airing her desire for it in general. It just makes her look incredibly selfish.", "You are a good mom and have been supporting your daughter like a pro. I have a huge respect for how you kept your opinion to yourself. NTA at all. You told her gently give her some time.", "That's basically what I said, down to the morality clause bit? Marital status is a protected class in some states though so it's not as black and white there", "Of course, of course. You are a *distinguished* gentleman.", "Lol, you\u2019re just as bad as Nathan\\_Poe!", "It was long ago but I knew a lady who'd been a mistress for like 29 years. And she thought her guy's wife didn't know about her. One of the first things that happened after the guy died was his wife put mistresses home on the market. She knew. She'd taken steps to minimize the financial impacts of his keeping a woman for so longs. And she sent the sheriff to force the mistress out. \n\nI was a teenager then. But, I remember thinking: Yeah. Some wives just ain't playin'. And a mistress is hardly a sympathetic figure in most circles.", "I am simply astounded that she thinks she is owed anything TBH. He may have proposed but they never actually built a life together, his wife and he had a DAUGHTER she (the wife) while married may have made financial sacrifices for the betterment of their future....like you said the $ should go to Nancy for the care of his daughter and this was by HIS design..luna is living a loney tunes fantasy op should have never supported. Support her in her grief that is real, her entitlement is off the charts though.", "Yup, got his diagnosis in March, and passed over the summer (June-August, *maybe* early September). At minimum he had two months, this wasn't a \"two weeks to live\" thing.", "Eh, not if you were the king. Obviously, the queen and their children had the royal titles, lands, etc, but mistresses weren\u2019t some dirty, shameful secret. Everyone in the French court knew about them and acknowledged them for who/what they were. The king\u2019s mistresses had almost as much status as the queen herself, especially during the height of French aristocracy. Mistresses received a lot of gifts and their husbands/fathers were rewarded pretty handsomely with land, titles, etc. The main purpose of his mistresses was to provide backup heirs, if the queen didn\u2019t have any surviving heirs. That level of social acceptability was pretty exclusively a French king thing, but European kings in general had mistresses and there\u2019s not much anyone could do about it. That doesn\u2019t make it right, but that\u2019s how things were. \n\nRegardless, French aristocracy is dead and should not be used as a model for how today\u2019s society works, which was my original point. Luna  has all of the entitlement and that\u2019s the problem.", "If you are not married, you can change it whenever. But, like my state, many require the spouse to sign off.", "I think I replied to the wrong person", "Then it sounds like the person she should feel angry and betrayed by is Greg for not including her in the life insurance policy or the will.  She sounds way too immature, greedy, self absorbed, and oblivious to the harm she caused and that the cheater she was with was using her. Not surprising that this cheater didn\u2019t reward her for her companionship.", "Who cares ? She broke up the family .", "can I just have the money instead?", "I believe that\u2019s true in California. I was divorced and had to complete specific paperwork to remove my ex as beneficiary.", "\ud83d\ude02 did the fact he left your daughter NOTHING after finding out he was terminal clue you in. If he wanted her to have something other than memories he would've included that.", "Nothing wrong with how you're handling your daughter through this bs but if she starts lashing out at you and your family nothing wrong with putting your foot down more. I mean maybe it's the grief but your daughter has got some nerve making demands from a recently widowed woman who's husband she had an affair with.", "Yep, as the old saying goes \u2018if they\u2019ll cheat with you, they\u2019ll cheat on you\u2019.", "Sure have some more internet points. Maybe some day they will be worth something.", "Pretty crazy that OPs daughter doesn't have enough shame to realize no one really feels bad for her", "what?  They're not worth anything?\n\nI've wasted my life.", "From the wording of your post it sounds like Greg found out he was dying then told his wife (or she found out) he was in a years long affair. Your daughter had the audacity to harass a woman who went from \"the man I love is dying\" to \"the man I love has betrayed me in a horrible way\" to finally \"the man I thought loved me and the father of my child is dead\" in a matter of months. I can't imagine the emotional whip lash she is still sorting through while your entitled daughter demands money from her. You are the AH for not being harsh with her at this point.", "As her parent , you should have told her to be happy that she got some sentimental items at least from the will. To expect money from the surviving spouse and his child , means that your daughter did not really love this man and only wanted money for services rendered.", "You need to stop treating your daughter like a mentally fragile child and square up with her. Otherwise she is going to continue making a proper wreck of her life and the lives of anyone unlucky enough to cross her path, like Nancy.", "I get where you're coming from but I think reality would be best. She needs to be more thankful Nancy is being as nice as she is. If it were my husband Luna wouldn't have been permitted at the funeral period.", "Also OP why does Lina feel she should be included in family things when she was having an affair?", "It might. Because she needs to stop calling herself a victim in this, and she needs to take stock of her choices so she can do better next time. Stop coddling her.", "Sorry, but you are enabling the terrible, entitled, morally bankrupt behaviour of your offspring. Adultery is a sin, and also illegal in some places for a reason...because only the worst kind of selfish assholes do it. Not only that, but she was disrespecting his wife and child in a huge way.", "I think that Luna will eventually realize that herself, but probably not until she's a lot older and realizes that life is full of Gregs", "She didn't even have enough shame to not go to the funeral so Nancy wouldn't have to look at the side piece.", "The emotional whiplash that must have happened to Nancy deserves every penny of that policy.", "The fact that she seems to have no understanding of how outrageous she is being is very telling. The fact that she actually brought this up expecting people to be on her side is so utterly tone deaf. You don\u2019t have to have a cheating incident in the family  to understand how awful her behavior is. She is entitled and selfish and a bully, trying to get other people to be on her side. And the fact the Greg let her, his side piece, interact with his daughter?!?! I have no words. She was deliberately running a campaign to take Greg and his daughter away from his wife! That is some scumbaggery of the highest order. Saying out loud that she is entitled to his life insurance is just icing on the cake of this awful human OP has raised. She needs a reality check from her father, not support for this shitty and devious behavior.", "This should be the top comment. OP isn\u2019t the AH for telling her daughter she should have expected her families reactions. OP is the AH because she consistently validated her daughters feelings and actions, no matter how wrong they were. Her daughter is currently shocked the world thinks she\u2019s wrong because her parents have always told her she\u2019s right.", "This is my take too. OP sounds like a kind and caring person, but Luna sounds so callous. It\u2019s as if Luna doesn\u2019t realize she was the other woman. And as a married person, I don\u2019t have to be cheated on to empathize with someone who has.", "Yes this. I would have had some sympathy for my daughter at the start of this debacle. When she started the money grubbing I would have been too ashamed to show my face in public and would have had a hard time speaking to her. Leaving with her and hugging her in support when she showed her greedy, adulterous ass at the family dinner??? Get outta here. No wonder Luna is an amoral piece of work if she has always been coddled and spoiled like this by her parents.", "Bro, her daughter is a grown ass woman that already knew how cheaters were going to be viewed in her family, why do you think she hid it? \n\nStop blaming parents for their grown ass kids choices. After they leave the house whatever they decide to do has nothing to do with the parents. And this is coming from a 28yo that made very bad choices in her early 20s that knew her parents raised her not to do that stupid crap. You gotta own up to your fuck ups and not blame everyone else. \n\nSome people just want to play victim when they know they are the one causing hurt. No reality check is going to help them, they need to figure that out all on their own. Hell her mom was already being gentle and the daughter immediately went \"I'VE BEEN BETRAYED!\" You really think adding \"it was never going to be the fairy tale you wanted\" is going to do anything but get her more pissed off and push away from her family?", "Disown for poor life choices? Please never procreate.", "Except she probably liked the fact she was \"chosen\". Many women have a thing for married men or unavailable men because they feel like they have a one up on the gf/wife/partner. If they get into normal relationships, they become bored/don't feel doted on enough/project. \n\nThere are just some women that are just as stupid as some men when it comes to people's affections.", ">On the other hand Luna deserves so much better than a married man.\n\nYah right.. Luna \"deserves\" to be married to a man who does the exact same thing to her with an OW who is just as much a bunny boiler as she is."]}
