Tough love is needed sometimes. It would be one thing IF she was making an effort and/or took your dad up on his offer, but even she admitted to you she \"doesn't want to do all of that\". Losing weight takes time, effort and commitment which it doesn't sound like she's done any of. You have nothing to be sorry for.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your sister has been making comments about your weight loss journey for a while now, and it's understandable that you would eventually reach a breaking point. It's not fair for her to constantly compare herself to you and make comments about your body and what you eat. It's also not fair for her to expect the same results without putting in the same effort.\r  \n\r  \nYou didn't say anything that wasn't true, and it sounds like your dad agrees with you. While it's important to be sensitive to others' feelings, it's also important to stand up for yourself when someone is constantly putting you down. Your friend's comment about not being able to say anything about weight now that you're skinny is unfair and dismissive of your experience.\r  \n\r  \nIt might be worth having a conversation with your sister about how her comments make you feel and finding a way to support each other in your respective journeys towards a healthy lifestyle. But in this particular situation, you were not in the wrong for standing up for yourself.", "Clear NTA\n\nYour sister kept chiselling away at your patience and you what you said was 100% true. Yes, maybe you could have said it in a nicer way but she really pushed it.", "NTA. \n\nSure what you said was harsh but she needed to hear it from somebody. She shouldn't be allowed to comment on your body and diet without recieving some backlash. Your friend is weird for their beliefs. Just because you are skinny now doesn't mean you can't say anything about weight especially when the other party is bringing weight into the conversation. In my opinion, I don't think ANYONE should have a say on someone's diet and body unless they specifically ask for it.", "NTA. Your friend is an AH though, saying you can\u2019t comment on weight? That\u2019s just ridiculous. Maybe try and have a real heart to heart with your sister and lay it out, that you can\u2019t just magically lose weight by not doing anything; and then tell her to stop making comments if she\u2019s not going to try at all", "\"You are skinny now, so you can't say...\" Seriously? Not entirely sure I'd keep a friend like that around, but that's up to you. You have more right to talk like that **because** you worked hard to loose the weight and get healthy, while you sister drowns in her envy.\n\nI am an overweight woman, I know how hard it is, but at the end of the day it is your sisters responsibility to change. \n\nAlso, the way she keeps talking, maybe a therapist should be in her near future. Cause she is talking all kinds of obsessive and unhealthy.\n\nNTA", "NTA it\u2019s hard when someone has downplayed the work you put in to better yourself especially when they have the same opportunities as you.\n\nI am in know way fat shaming your sister and neither where you. You didn\u2019t say anything out of the way. You told her the truth. \n\nI have lost over 80 pounds. I get tired of the comments saying they wished they could loose the weight. When you offer the advice no one want to put in the work. They think we magically took a pill and got rid of the weight. They don\u2019t take in consideration we work daily to stay healthy.", "NTA\n\nIm pretty sure your sister is trying to kill you with kindness by complimenting you till the point you get mad at her. She envies you to put it that way", "NTA", "You have to put your foot down like you did or it doesn\u2019t stop. She will keep commenting on your body and what you eat otherwise. NTA and good for you for your healthy boudaries", "NTA. You lost weight for you and your personal health goals. You spent years having your sister make unwanted comments on your body. You say you \u201csnapped\u201d, but you didn\u2019t insult or fat shame her. You simply said that she won\u2019t do the work to get the results she wants (which she has said herself before), even though your father has offered the same level of support. Tell your mom and your skinny shaming friend that this is no different from your sister wanting blue hair but walking past the dye boxes in cvs.", "ESH. Your sister's comments sound draining, but you shouldn't have reacted the way you did. Instead of implying her weight is a personal failing on her part (wtf, no), it would have been appropriate to say \"I don't like it when you comment on my body and your body like that.\"", "As someone who's fat but has had fluctuating weight my whole life, NTA. I NEEDED THOSE COMMENTS about my weight, I needed wake up calls more often and only lost weight when I had them. And your ' friend ' can gtfoh about not being able to speak about weight just cause you're skinny now, that's not how it works. If you were never fat then I'd understand but you were so you have every right.", "YTA.  First of all, if someone is constantly having conversations with you that you aren't comfortable with, use your big girl words and tell them.  You don't keep it bottled up until you explode inappropriately in anger.   More importantly, your sister is complementing you on being able to lose weight while shaming herself.   Your solution to that \"problem\" is to go off on her and further shame and blame her?  Are you really that self centered that you don't see or care about her struggle?  Nutritionists and trainers may have worked for you.  That may not be what she needs to succeed.  Her eating may be emotionally based or some other trigger and she may benefit from mental health treatment first.  Everyone is different.  How have you tried to encourage her?  Have you offered to go on an afternoon walk together?  Go to a cooking class?  Do you tell her she looks good just the way she is?  Be an adult, go apologize for blowing up at her and ask her how can you help and support her in her journey.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
