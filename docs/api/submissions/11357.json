We went to a casual restaurant where my girlfriend could meet my family for the first time in a low stress environment\n\nNow, one thing you should know about my family is that me and my brother(14M) are very close. I taught him how to ride a bike, I helped him with his homework, I taught him his letters. If it came down to it, I would take his side over my girlfriend's in a heartbeat. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered a burger and some fries and a milkshake. Now, my brother and I usually do this thing where we jokingly steal each other's food. It's a sign of bonding, so my brother stole a couple of my girlfriend's fries and dipped it in the milkshake. She was turned around talking to my mom and then saw him pop the fries in his mouth.\n\nAs I saw him do that, I was going to gently admonish him, but to my surprise, my girlfriend puts her finger in his face, and starts harshly scolding him, about how what he did was \"incredibly rude and disrespectful\", how he \"ruined\" her food, and how she doesn't want some kid to steal her food. \n\nAt this point, I was seeing red. I told her to knock it off, that we do it all the time to each other, and to stop being so prissy, like it's just food. \n\nWhen we got home, we had a pretty big fight, and as of this morning, my girlfriend is staying over at her best friend's place, and left me all alone in our apartment. I'm not really sure what just happened, but her best friend called me to tell me that I was a big jerk in this situation, and I'm starting to feel kinda bad.", "created_utc": 1677834279, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gw2ma/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriend_prissy_over_a/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He dipped fries in her milkshake? Without asking her? The first time he met her? He's 14. Not 4. Kids should be taught when they're young. Since you taught him so much maybe you missed teaching him manners.", "1. There\u2019s a difference between stealing some fries and ruining a milkshake.\n2. Your brother is old enough to understand that it was a game between you and him and not him and the entire world.\n3. Sometimes young teenager go too far and need to learn the concequences of their actions. He should have apologized and pay for another drink and that would have been it.\n4. Saying \u00ab\u00a0I would chose him over my girlfriend\u00a0\u00bb is a red flag for me, not because you are a good brother but because you are unable to see that sometimes he will be in the wrong and that it\u2019s normal to be \u00ab\u00a0against him\u00a0\u00bb. A mature adult accept the fact that somebody he love can sometimes be wrong and that he don\u2019t have to always to agree. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou and your brother doing it doesn't mean he should do it with other people as well.", "He dipped the fries he stole in her milkshake.. \n\nHe did ruin her food. Or at least her milkshake for sure.\n\nHe's 14 not a toddler He should know better than to steal other people food, you taught him so many things but forgot to teach them basic manners and respect of other people's food.\n\nYTA, and so is your brother, I knew not to take other people food without asking since I was 4", "YTA\n\nYour brother needs to be thought boundaries. He can't just start taking other people's food and dipping it in their milkshake. And you saw it and said nothing. It might be a \"bonding experience\" for him, but it can be disgusting to other people.", "YTA - Let\u2019s put this another way. If your brother had done the exact same thing to people at the next table, would you have told them to knock it off when they yelled at him \u201cbecause it\u2019s just it\u2019s food\u201d? Or would you (and your parents) be embarrassed by your brother\u2019s behavior and profusely apologize to them? My guess is the latter. This is the equivalent of what happened to your girlfriend. Your reaction should be a red flag for your girlfriend. This indicates that you won\u2019t stand up for her against your family when they do something wrong.", "YTA. It is rude to steal food off someone\u2019s plate that you\u2019re just meeting that day. 14 is old enough to have appropriate social boundaries. It\u2019s even more rude to dip said food in that person\u2019s drink?? \n\nAdmittedly if I were the girlfriend, i probably would have reacted more calmly outwardly, but still would have been shocked and angry inwardly. You, being the brother (or your parents), should have admonished him in the moment and offered to get her a new milkshake.", "Wow, so, you and your brother have this secret \u201cbond\u201d that your GF had no idea about. She got upset that your brother took her fries and dunked them into her milkshake\u2026\n\nOF COURSE SHE\u2019S GOING TO BE UPSET!! I would be upset if someone I barely knew jammed their hands into my fries and plunked them into my milkshake.\n\nYou and your brother are VERY MUCH TAH here!!\n\nI get you taught him how to ride a bike and shizz but this behavior is completely inappropriate! If you don\u2019t see that you are majorly TAH.\n\nWTH is wrong with you?!", "What? You and your brother stealing each other's food is a thing between the two of you and even if he meant that as a bonding thing between him and your girlfriend that was really inappropriate and he needs to learn some boundaries.\n\nNot sure what you mean by your gf putting her finger in his face, that sounds a bit extreme. And while I personally like the fries and milkshake combo it's disgusting for many and I don't understand why your brother would put your gf's fries into her milkshake. I can understand how that would ruin someone's meal.\n\nWhy would you take your brother's side over your girlfriend's? Even if he's in the wrong? That sounds odd. Definitely YTA, your brother too. Possibly E S H as your girlfriend's reaction sounds a bit extreme, but if so, only slight AH", "YTA\n\nYour brother is too, you dont steal food from someone who you dont have that kind of connection to. And it\u2019s fucking disgusting to put fries into SOMEONE elses drink FFS.\n\nTeach him some manners", "YTA. And you\u2019re double TA for hoping she dumps you first. Grow a pair and do it yourself since you clearly don\u2019t like her", "YTA. What your brother did was gross, just because you two behave this way doesn\u2019t mean he gets to inflict it on her", "YTA! He's old enough to understand that what YOU guys do, not everyone will enjoy. It is extremely rude to steal food off someone's plate (not to mention someone YOU'RE JUST MEETING). As someone who also dips fries in milkshakes I'd only do it to my own milkshake, not someone else's. And nowhere did you mention that warned your girlfriend about this \"bonding\".", "YTA Personally, I don't really care how you normally interact with your brother. Because he's not interacting with you, he's stealing and interfering with your girlfriends food, not yours. 14 is far to old for that to be a light admonition offense. She is in no way being prissy. If you really care about your brother, teach him some manners.", "If my daughter had done that to her older brother\u2019s girlfriend I would have yelled at her myself. 14 is old enough to know that you don\u2019t do take other people\u2019s food, unless you know they\u2019re ok with it. I get that you didn\u2019t like the fact that your girlfriend yelled at your brother. But he was way out of line. Also not letting someone take food off of your plate without asking isn\u2019t being prissy. In many families no one would even dream of taking things off of a family members plate without asking. And your girlfriend is a stranger to your brother. YTA and you and your brother owe your girlfriend an apology in my opinion.", "YTA. People don\u2019t like their food touched as a rule. Someone needs to actually scold that boy because clearly not one in your family is doing it.", "YTA. You know each other well enough that you can do this cutesy rugrat shit with each other but she doesn't have that bond with him. All she saw was some tween putting his grubby hands on her plate and then dunking them in her milkshake. I wouldn't want some kid doing that to me either.", "Joey does not share his food, we all know he is right", "YTA. If your family has not taught him basic table manners by his age, don't be surprised when others step in and do it for you.", "YTA. \n\n>we do it all the time to each other\n\nShe doesn't. She had no idea that you did this. Why didn't he take your food if that's what you do?", "Yta. While you and your little brother may treat it as good natured bonding and teasing which is totally fine.  But to grab someone else food that you don\u2019t know is rude and at 14 he should have learned better table manners by now.  \n\nSurely you know better than to reach across the table and grab fries off her father\u2019s plate when you first meet her parents?", "YTA. Your inside joke doesn\u2019t entitle him to her food, not everyone likes to share their food. If my brothers try to steal my food without asking they\u2019re lucky to not get a fork in their hand. It\u2019s not a sign of bonding to me, it\u2019s a violation of my personal bubble. I\u2019m not sure why you just expected her to think it was cute and funny and got pissed when she reacted in a very normal way.", "YTA. The kid just met your girlfriend and dipped fries in her milkshake? That\u2019s weird. \n\nJust because that\u2019s how you bond with him doesn\u2019t make it ok. Yeah, she probably when over the top-  but you even say you were going to admonish him. You know he was wrong!", "YTA.\n\nA 14-year old boy should know that taking someone else\u2018s food without consent isn\u2018t okay in any way and your girlfriend was right to set a boundary and scold him if you and your parents willingly fail to teach him simple manners.\n\nYou\u2018d choose him over your girlfriend immediately, so do everyone a favor and leave this poor woman alone. She deserves a better man!", "YTA you don't take a strangers food AND DIP IT IN THEIR DRINK and eat it.\n\n\nIf thats what you and your brother do, thats fine, but he's old enough to know (and so are you) that you don't do it without consent. You owe your gf an apology.", "YTA. You don\u2019t just take someone else\u2019s food, at 14 he should know better. Seems to me though you\u2019ve already decided he can literally get away with anything", "YTA...your brother was wrong. You need to apologize to your girlfriend and talk to your brother.", " *Now, my brother and I usually do this thing where we jokingly steal each other's food.*\n\nYour gf was not part of the equation. \n\nYTA", "YTA.

Insulting your girlfriend because she put up a boundary, firmly? I kinda hope she dumps you.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t know about your little game with your brother. Without knowing it, what he did could easily be perceived as rude or I\u2019ll mannered. You could have calmly explained it to her and also you should have told your brother to knock it off since she doesn\u2019t know the ins and outs yet.\n\np.s. YTA 2x for only responding to / agreeing with the few comments that say you aren\u2019t an asshole. You *are* in fact an asshole and you\u2019re only making yourself look like more of an asshole.", "YTA -  by 14 he should know that you don\u2019t take another persons food off their plate without permission.  You\nJust don\u2019t do that.  It\u2019s incredibly rude.\n\nYou are backing up\nHis rude behavior.   \n\nTaking his side all the time is not a sign of love on your part.  Its validating bad behavior.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t being prissy,  your brother was being rude and you are being an asshole by taking his side when he is clearly wrong.", "YTA just because he can do that to you doesn\u2019t mean he can steal other peoples food, that\u2019s not bonding for them. He needs taught some manners. I don\u2019t want a kids fingers in my food either. She\u2019s not wrong for not wanting that.", "Yes, you are the asshole in this situation. Your girlfriend was understandably upset when your brother stole her food and dipped it in the milkshake, and it was inappropriate for you to dismiss her feelings and call her prissy. It's important to respect your partner's boundaries and feelings, even if they don't align with your own.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, it's concerning that you prioritize your relationship with your brother over your girlfriend. While it's great that you have a close relationship with your brother, it's not fair to choose sides and prioritize him over your girlfriend in every situation.\r  \n\r  \nIt's understandable that you're feeling bad about the situation, but it's important to take responsibility for your actions and apologize to your girlfriend for dismissing her feelings. It's also important to have a conversation about boundaries and respect in your relationship moving forward.", "YTA. Its a bonding thing between the two of you.  Its rude to touch the food of someone that you havent agreed to have the same bonding experience with. Maybe teach him that he doesnt touch other peoples food without their express agreement instead of telling your girlfriend she is being prissy. And im sorry, dunking food in someone elses drink is disgusting.", "YTA. You and your brother can tolerate any rude behavior from each other if you want. That's your choice. But no one else has to tolerate rude treatment just because you two have a mutual understanding. 14 is way beyond old enough to know basic table manners. No one should even need to explain to him at this point that you don't steal food from others and that some people will consider a milkshake ruined once it has salt, grease, and finger germs dunked into it. \n\nHe is old enough to accept the consequence of his bad behavior is that someone may be pissed anout having their food messed with. He should have apologized and paid for a new drink. You should have butted out of it unless he refused to make amends immediately. \n\nThat you think your girlfriend is in the wrong and needs to be dumped because she doesn't want someone else's grubby fingers in her food (have you even heard of the pandemic, hello?) is astonishing. But it's good she knows now that as a principle you will always defend his shitty behavior and blame her for being shat on. So what could have been a very trivial glitch that you all laugh at later has instead turned out for the best because you revealed yourself to her. Good luck finding a partner in life who is fine with having a husband who is resolved to always side with his brother over her, no matter what a butthead he is being toward her.", "YTA, it was a perfectly understandable reaction on her part.  \n After reading more comments, it sounds like you forgot to take credit for teaching him to be rude and entitled as well.", "YTA\n\nYou've already been explained why, but I would like to point out that you are on a real slippery slope towards teaching your brother to become an entitled asshole who thinks he can do what he want without consequences.\n\nAlso, I've seen your sulky comments about you hoping your girlfriend dumps you too. Grow a spine and dump her yourself if this is how you're gonna act when people point out that you were in the wrong.", "YTA. \n\nWhat your brother did WAS incredibly rude and disrespectful. He's meeting her for the first time, it's completely inappropriate. \n\n>If it came down to it, I would take his side over my girlfriend's in a heartbeat. \n\nThis kind of loyalty is toxic and doesn't do your brother any good. If you want to be a good role model, you shouldn't shield him from consequences or defend his actions when he does something wrong.", "YTA, she's right and you should have explained to your brother why doing it to someone outside the inside joke was inappropriate. Maybe if he'd done it to you first she could have seen that it wasn't intended the way she thought it was.", "YTA. You have this cute bonding thing with your brother and that's great but she doesn't know him. They don't yet have a relationship where a little good natured teasing is encouraged and accepted by both parties. You should apologize to your gf and explain to your kid brother why it's not ok to do that with other people's food.", "YTA.\n\nHonestly, you lose me the minute you said \u201cIf it came down to it, I would take his side over my girlfriend\u2019s in a heartbeat.\u201d I\u2019m a similar age to you, with a brother a similar age to your brother. This shouldn\u2019t be a guaranteed statement. No matter how much you love a sibling, they absolutely can be in the wrong. \n\nWhile his stealing food behaviour is normal to you, it isn\u2019t normal to her. I wouldn\u2019t have my little brother stealing food from my partner\u2019s plate unless he was both in on the joke and comfortable with it. Your girlfriend wasn\u2019t either of those things. \n\nYour brother learning that he shouldn\u2019t be stealing food like this from everyone is *so so* important. Teach him that, quickly. Before he does do it to someone who responds in a more intense way. If he wanted some of her fries\u2026he could\u2019ve asked. \n\nYou also have to stop and think that some people would find him dipping fries into their milkshake gross. Heck, as someone in eating disorder recovery that would make me even less likely to eat my food than I already am.", ">that we do it all the time to each other\n\nYour girlfriend doesn't do this \"all the time\" with him.   Did she over react a bit, yes, but he is old enough to learn to get to know someone before trying to eat their food.   YTA", "Your brother was an asshole for fucking with your girlfriend's food.\n\nYou're an asshole for defending the asshole.\n\nYou're a second asshole for not defending your girlfriend.\n\nYou're a third asshole for skipping manners whilst teaching your brother biking and reading.", "YTA. If you and your brother are doing that all the time, why was he not simply stealing your food? And you saw it happening and did nothing, no wonder your girlfriend was shocked and reacted strongly to a 14 year old showing behaviour that would not be Ok even for a 6 year old and his family seeing no problem with him sticking his grubby hands into a strangers food.", "YTA\n\nJust because it\u2019s a cute bonding ritual when he does it with you doesn\u2019t mean he should do it to a stranger he\u2019s just met. Me and my best friend sometimes sneak up behind each other and pull the front of our top over the other\u2019s head - doesn\u2019t mean we should do it to a new neighbour or colleague. The whole point of those kinds of little rituals with someone you\u2019re close to is that it\u2019s a symbol of intimacy - \u2018I can do this thing with you because we\u2019re close, it wouldn\u2019t be permitted for other people\u2019. \nThat\u2019s a pretty basic and straightforward distinction that your brother is old enough to understand - and you definitely are.\nThat goes double for messing with people\u2019s food which is sensitive for a lot of people and kinda gross. \n\nHe was out of order so she told him off - if it was me I might have looked to you or your family to do that before going off on him, so there might have been a case for E-S-H. But the fact that you\u2019re still trying to make out that his behaviour was acceptable gets you double AH points, so YTA it is.", "YTA\n\nI have food issues, I 100% would not drink a milkshake after someone dipped fries in it. Your brother is old enough to know what you do with family you don\u2019t do when you first meet someone and you shouldn\u2019t have blamed her for his behaviour. Did you even warn her that mucking about with food is something you guys do? Was she prepared??", "I'm gunna say YTA.  Like.  Like stealing food... t's one thing to do that to someone who is in on the joke, but to do it to what is almost a stranger.  It's not about the fries.  It's more about the fact the brother crossed what is normally a pretty universally understood boundary and violated your gf's personal space.  In fact we women find it actually pretty frightening when men violate these boundaries so your girlfriend's strong reaction is pretty understandable.  Your brother is old enough to know better.  And if he isn't, well, thank God your sister was there to teach him.", "YTA. You and your brother have a thing where you take each others food, fine. He's 14. He's old enough to know not to do that to other people. Your gf's reaction to someone she doesn't really know fucking with her food was pretty mild. All you and your brother did was team up and ruin the dinner.", ">  I was seeing red. I told her to knock it off, that we do it all the time to each other\n\n...and what has that got to do with your girlfriend? \n\nYTA", "Did he dipped it in HER milkshake??? Because that is the definition of ruining the food even if you're not bothered by a 14 year old with a 14 year old hygiene touching your food.\n\nShe should have just pushed her plate to him and ordered something else. \n\nBut you're an asshole. YTA", "YTA. One thing is if you allow your brother to tamper with your food, but you have no business berating your GF for not wanting it. Personally, I find that kind of behaviour absolutely disgusting, and if you and your brother haven't been told before, it is about time you were.", "YTA. How you could envision her as being the one in the wrong is beyond me.", "YTA. And so is your brother. It is rude to touch someone else's food. Your brother doesn't have that kind of relationship with her. You should grow up and stop acting 14. Also, I hope she breaks up with you so she can go date a grown man that doesn't get his ego hurt when a woman can defend herself. You were going to tell him to stop until she did it first and suddenly it was widely unacceptable behavior.", "Don't touch other people's food ever. YTA and so is your brother. Just because you two do it doesn't mean it's okay to do it to a stranger. YTA again for \"seeing red\" and your GF is TA for scolding your brother in public as that could have just been a conversation, and it's not her job to yell at your brother", "YTA\n\nYour brother stole food off a complete stranger's plate and you think SHE'S in the wrong? She told him that what he did was rude.... Which it was.... Perhaps your brother needs someone in his life that doesn't \"gently admonish him\" when he does something wrong. Short of her actually making physical contact with him, I see nothing wrong with what she did.", "YTA. You and your brother need better manners. How embarrassing for your parents that someone else has to remind you lot of that", "YTA he probably didn\u2019t mean any harm, and she could have set the boundary without humiliating him BUT you were TA by being dismissive and condescending about her need for that boundary with her food, which is perfectly reasonable and obviously important to her.", "YTA. A man should take the side of what's true, right and moral. Not simply the side of a person, just because.", "YTA everyone has different boundaries. I mean Joey doesn't share food & neither does your gf. Deal with it.", "So you taught him numbers, how to ride a bike, and helped with homework.  That's all great. \n\nBut too bad you didn't teach him manners, how not to be rude and how to be respectful of other people's things. \n\nYTA op, and you taught him how to be TA as well.\n\nEdit: Your gf (soon to be ex) wasn't being prissy. She was standing up for herself since you obviously weren't going to.", "Lol YTA. my god.", "Yta \n\nShe's right 100%\n\nWhat you and your brother do is between you too and you too alone. He is a stranger to her and here he is taking of with her food wtf dude.", "YTA \n\nYou already ruined the relationship with your attitude if \u201cI\u2019d side with my brother over my girlfriend any day.\u201d Sounds like you haven\u2019t met the right one. Especially if you\u2019re letting someone act rude towards her. She should be pissed, someone touched her food. That\u2019s disgusting.", "YTA\n\nWhat your brother did is okay between you two. She's never met him before. She doesnt want a strangers fingers in her food. I would have been upset too. However i wouldn't have started scolding him there, I would have told him that it wasn't okay to do that to someone who hadn't established that those jokes were okay. She could have handled it better\n\nYou need to teach your brother boundaries. If he bonds with your friends and partner to the point where they are comfortable doing stuff like that too, great! But your brother can't just assume he can treat whoever you bring along the same way he treats you.", "YTA. Your brother needs to learn to keep his hands to himself and not touch other people's food. The fact that you think the issue here is your girlfriend and not your poorly-mannered brother is really pathetic.", "YTA.\n\nYou and your brother do it to each other? Fair enough. \nYour brother does it to a stranger who isn\u2019t aware of this bonding \u2018game\u2019 - no. That\u2019s crossing boundaries.", "YTA", "You and your brother sound like animals. Good you have this relationship. If a STRANGER started grabbing my food, putting it in my drink and eating it in front of me I\u2019d have poured the shake over their head. \n\nGross- you just want a reason to blame her not your brother he\u2019s 14 not 4! Get some manners you jerk it\u2019s gross", "YTA. this is the first time they're meeting, gf is not in on any joke. And a 14 y.o who doesn't know that doing that to someone who isn't u..... seriously AH as well.", "Some people don\u2019t like having someone else\u2019s fingers in their food? Yta", "Your girlfriend was setting a boundary and you went off on her because \"brother can do no wrong\"? YTA", "YTA\n\nIf that would only be a thing fore you 2 brothers - that's fine. Doing it to a stranger - is very bad behaviour. And if the 9 years old kid of my gf did this - he'd get scolded by my gf or me since you can expect better behaviour for that age. If a 14 year old boy doesnt get this - someone fucked up.\n\nGoing angry over this to your gf - is a dick move. I wouldnt wonder if your gf decides to not meet you again.", "YTA\n\nIf your brother can't tell the difference between you and your girlfriend he needs an eye doctor. If he can then he's old enough to know you don't steal food from people you just met. And you should apologize to your girlfriend both for not defending her and for calling her names.", "I can tell from your comments that the relationship is pretty much done. Honestly I'd be pissed if some 14 year old put his hands in my food. What parents neglect to teach their kid that isn't appropriate behavior?\nThen you just sit and watch it happen and enable the bad behavior.\n\nMaybe she shouldn't have been so harsh but neither should you be so dismissive of the issue. That he did it to someone he just met was bold and entitled. She wasn't even looking at him so you know good and well he wasn't doing it to bond with her because It'd be quite hard to do that if he played your little game behind her back. He was  showing off for you because you were looking at him.\n\nShe rightfully told him off and you jumped in to defend him. I have a hunch you likely defend a lot of his bad behaviors and that is why he made such a bold move as to feel entitled to her food. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. I also think you\u2019re probably exaggerating. But there are loads of people who do not like their food being touched. You\u2019re at a restaurant, get your own fucking fries and stay off mine.", "You and your family can play like that with each other all you want, but remember that doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is fine with that sort of play.

I taught him how to ride a bike, I helped him with his homework, I taught him his letters. If it came down to it, I would take his side over my girlfriend's in a heartbeat. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered a burger and some fries and a milkshake. Now, my brother and I usually do this thing where we jokingly steal each other's food. It's a sign of bonding, so my brother stole a couple of my girlfriend's fries and dipped it in the milkshake. She was turned around talking to my mom and then saw him pop the fries in his mouth.\n\nAs I saw him do that, I was going to gently admonish him, but to my surprise, my girlfriend puts her finger in his face, and starts harshly scolding him, about how what he did was \"incredibly rude and disrespectful\", how he \"ruined\" her food, and how she doesn't want some kid to steal her food. \n\nAt this point, I was seeing red. I told her to knock it off, that we do it all the time to each other, and to stop being so prissy, like it's just food. \n\nWhen we got home, we had a pretty big fight, and as of this morning, my girlfriend is staying over at her best friend's place, and left me all alone in our apartment. I'm not really sure what just happened, but her best friend called me to tell me that I was a big jerk in this situation, and I'm starting to feel kinda bad.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\u2019t like that\u201d would be fine.", "My intended reaction and her reaction was completely different,\n\nMy intended reaction - \"hey buddy, don't do that again, we're out in company, allright, thats not cool\".\n\nHer reaction - Berate and scold him, basically humiliate him with the severity of her scolding\n\nMy parents were in shock and disbelief at her behavior, and later told me that they're really proud of me for standing up for my brother", "Tbh, I'm feeling a little bad, it all happened so fast and i keep thinking whether I should have done something different, but at the same time, I think you're right, we're not going to last so long as she treats my brother with disrespect and rudeness", "Stealing someone\u2019s food is also unnecessarily and rude and her reaction was not inappropriate.    it\u2019s UNDERSTANDABLE if she gets aggressive in this situation", "\u201cGently admonish\u201d doesn\u2019t sound very effective at all when he seems to see the behavior as cute and acceptable", "Fair enough, but he sought to make this into a teachable moment for his brother, rather than apologizing to his gf.", "And teenagers are going to have the consequence of other people\u2019s reactions to their poor social decisions.", "Only thing that doesn't have value judgement from op i that she said \"what he did was incredibly rude and disrespectful, and he ruined her food\". How is that an overreaction, when what he did was incredibly rude and disrespectful and ruined her food?", "He saw it happening, he could have stopped him when he started playing with her food.", "Except the kid did it when her back was turned, so he had plenty of time to react before she even knew it had happened. He didn\u2019t.", "How much you wanna bet one of those N T A is his brother ?!", "OP doesn't sound like a reliable narrator, so there's a good chance he exaggerated his girlfriend 's response.", "So, 14yo's fingers in the girlfriend's *food* is fine, but her finger in his face is too far? \n\nI'd be outraged if my teenage relative did what OP's brother did. But hey, obviously YMMV and you don't consider 14yo old enough to know not to touch other peoples' food.", ">My intended reaction\n\nSo you didn't react at all? \n\nShe might have gotten a bit overboard with her reaction but honestly I don't blame her that much. I doubt it that she was expecting someone stealing her food and ruining her drink. \n\nNot to mention how stressed she might have felt to meet your family and then this happens. \n\nThe fact you didn't react to him probably was wrong and your intended reaction was not enough. At 14 he should know better.", "So to sum it up:\n\n14 yo (old enough to know better then to do this) takes a strangers food he met 30 mins ago, and dips the fries in a milkshake (gets salt in milkshake). Said stranger (in a stressful moment of meeting family as well) points at him and scolds him. Which he deserved. He's 14, not 4. Strangers partner, aka YOU, sat there doing nothing. You could have calmed stranger (your gf) down and then tell your brother that really was not cool. Or tell him that was not cool and then try to calm her down (probs better odds). But you did nothing.\n\nYeah YTA. Your brother needs to learn manners.\n\nEDIT: removed \"tell her to calm down\" as that's stupid ofc", "Your parents don't come out of that looking great, either.\n\nYou've asked if you're the AH, and people have said yes & told you why they think that, but you don't seem to think that you are.\n\nYour brother is a stranger to your girlfriend, and should also know at 14 not to do what he did.", "Your intended reaction would have been fair if your brother was still five years old. Newsflash: he's not. You should all start treating him like the young adult he is.", "Your intended reaction was to talk to him like he\u2019s a toddler? He\u2019s a fricken teenager. His actions at 14 should be humiliating. Wtf? And your parents didn\u2019t scold him either? Omg. Lol this is a twilight zone.", " \"hey buddy, don't do that again to someone you don't know well.\"  ~~we're out in company, allright, thats not cool\".~~", ">My intended reaction - \"hey buddy, don't do that again, we're out in company, allright, thats not cool\".\n\nEven if you were in your own home its still 'not cool' for him to do with someone he doesn\u2019t know.", "Congrats. Sounds like you and your bratty entitled brother and your parents will be very happy together", "Yeah, if a bf of mine spoke to my little sister like that (I don\u2019t have a little brother) he would be Gonesville. No one gets in her face and yells at her and expects me to trust them or be relaxed and affectionate with them ever again.", "Didn't your brother treat her with disrespect and rudeness? That may not have been his intention but I think it's pretty clear from these verdicts that most people would interpret a kid stealing off their plate as rude and disrespectful.", "> she treats my brother with disrespect and rudeness\n\nUpon his first time meeting her, your brother took her food while her back was turned.\n\nHE was disrespectful and rude. Jesus christ.", "Your brother stole and played with her food. That is beyond disrespectful and rude and it's just gross as hell. He's old enough to know that's not a normal thing to do to someone. Especially someone he just met.", "But your brother is welcome to be utterly rude to her.\n\nGot it. Loud and clear.\n\nNot only will THIS relationship not last, neither will the next ones.", "She treats ur brother with disrespect??\n\nRespect is earned not given.\n\nYour brother deserves no respect at all, he ruined her food..", "No, you're not going to last long because you are so dense just like your snotty little brother. You dont mess with peoples food man. Hope she dumps you.", "As I said, she overreacted a bit, but please don't forget that he also treated her with disrespect and rudeness.   You are not going to fix this if you only focus on her mistake and not also on his.", "You brother is rude and disrespectful and when he continues to treat people with rudeness and disrespect they will respond to him in kind.  He\u2019s 14. He should know better. You should be Appalled at his behavior- not enabling him. He doesn\u2019t get to violate social norms and boundaries of others outside his enabling family and get \u201cnow buddy you shouldn\u2019t do that\u201d in a gentle tone. How did your family never teach him any manners??", "Nope your brother is being disrespectful and rude not your girlfriend... How can you be so blind and say that when literally everybody is saying your brother is wrong in his actions.\n\nApparently you taught him entitlement and rudeness is okay as well. Guess what, it's nooooot.", "I have a large age gap with my sibling as well and it was great. We have a great relationship. That\u2019s how I know you have a toxic relationship with yours. Stay single, please.", "I mean I get it, I\u2019m a little sibling and I know how humiliated your brother probably feels in that instance but the difference is that at 14 my brother  and parents taught me enough manners for me to understand that family inside jokes aren\u2019t meant for people we just met fucking 30 mins ago.\n\nCould your gf have been nicer about it? Sure \n\nWas she still in the right? Yep. \n\nSometime it\u2019s not \u201cjust food\u201d to people.\n\nIf your brother started tickling her because it was an inside joke and she started scolding him because he invaded her personal space, would you still be jumping to defend him?", "And shoving a finger in a kid\u2019s face and yelling at him is supposed to be effective? He\u2019s 14 but he\u2019s also still a kid who, like you said, sees the behavior as cute. First time should be a gentle admonishment that not everybody is going to accept having food stolen off their plate; if it happens again, then you get firmer in telling them to stop. I don\u2019t even have kids and I know that.", ">Except the kid did it when her back was turned, so he had plenty of time to react before she even knew it had happened.\n\nTaking a piece of fries and dipping it is less than a second. That's not plenty of time to react, especially when it's a minor misdeed, not something deeply despicable.\n\nAnd it doesn't really matter. It was a kid-vs-adult interaction. Yes, what the kid did wasn't acceptable. It HAD to be reprimanded. But not the way the girlfriend did. Scolding him in a super agressive way is way worse than what the kid did.", "Don't tell anyone to calm down when they're angry.\n\nIt never helps, often inflames the situation.", "Preach, sister!", "At this point, with the way things are going, I really hope so too", "A 14year old isn\u2019t a kid. He\u2019s a teenager who is old enough to know that you don\u2019t touch other peoples food.", "Oops, forgot to change that! Sorry, didn't mean it exactly like that, I know you should never say that exactly.", "Good thing you wont have to worry about something like this happening ever again.", "You insulted your girlfriend because she set a firm boundary with your sibling. Are you for real? Do you honestly think you\u2019re still in the right, here?", "> hope she dumps you\n \n> OP: hope so too\n \nSo you don't even care about your relationship", "Thats fitting. She had to step up and teach your brother basic manners, she might as well do all the heavy lifting and end the relationship while she's at it.", "You hope she breaks up with you? Grow up. Stop waiting for her to do the dirty work. If you want to breakup over this, speak up. YTA along with your rude little brother.", "You are an AH for this comment alone. Respect and courtesy isn\u2019t probably something you know much about given your family thinks it\u2019s cool to interfere with a stranger\u2019s food, however if you possess these characteristics you should break up with your girlfriend, rather than hoping she dumps you."]}
