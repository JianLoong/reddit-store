Did either of you account for that fact, especially as I think both of you are from North America? Do either of you genuinely know anywhere near enough of their financial systems to say the FIL can \"easily borrow against\" his assets? \n\nAnd that's even ignoring the fact that based on what OP has said (and likely he doesn't even know) the FIL's financial situation is not truly known. What if the FIL already has many loans taken out against his assets? Even disregarding local lending practices and availability, you really think any lender is going to lend money against assets where there is no remaining equity left? \n\nOP is most definitely not an AH for not lending money, but it seems completely naive to act like OP's apprehensions are unfounded and he doesn't know what he's talking about and you know better *when you're in a completely different environment and situation*.", "I absolutely love how you call us \"self-centred to think outside of your own bubbles,\" when you know absolutely nothing about either of us. \n\nWhile I cannot speak for ResoluteMuse, and while I definitely didn't stalk OP's prior postings to this, I can speak to financial assets, worldwide, as this is literally my job. \n\nIndia, has established banks, just like in North America. If his FIL has assets, he can most definitely borrow against them like you could in North America. \n\nWhile there are differing factors for loans at play, the same could be said vs you and I applying for a loan in the same area at the same bank. There are literally I think about 10 countries without established central banks. Every other country in the world has established banks. \n\nAlso, as someone who works with wealthy people who distribute assets to different areas and family members, I have never met a single person ever to transfer almost all their liquid assets to their kids leaving them without. This makes absolutely no sense in any way, and any financial advisor who would advise this is a maniac. \n\nAnd as for you going on about us thinking OP is the asshole, I never once said he was. I was trying to figure out what is going on, because it makes absolutely no sense to have a decent net worth, yet try to sponge money off someone who is saying they do not have any extra finances. I don't think OP is TA and would not give any money to FIL. \n\nBut you seem to know better about OP, and even myself and my qualifications.", "OP is indeed from Bangalore but moved to the US. He still visits his mother there regularly. He likes to shop at Costco.  OP\u2019s FIL has a history of asking/demanding expensive things from his daughter when he can well afford them himself.", ">And as for you going on about us thinking OP is the asshole, I never once said he was.\n\nI never said you did. It was largely from ResoluteMuse's patronizing reply of essentially \"yes it can, easily\" after OP said getting a loan couldn't be done at a moment's notice, and you agreeing with that reply. \n\n>If his FIL has assets, he can most definitely borrow against them like you could in North America.\n\nI never said you *can't* whatsoever, but we're not talking about general possibilities here. We're talking about getting money *quick* for a needed surgery (rarely something you can wait long on), and things like the ease of access to financial institutions or even the speed of funding, availability of cash (if physical cash is used) is very different in very different parts of the world. To assume they're the same just because the end goal of \"eventual funding\" is possible is completely naive. And of course, you're ignoring the patronizing \"easily\" part too. \n\nMaybe you might be able to open say, a HELOC quickly where you are, but even if they're offered the same way in Bangalore do you genuinely think it could be done anywhere nearly as quickly or as \"easily\"? \n\n>While there are differing factors for loans at play, the same could be said vs you and I applying for a loan in the same area at the same bank. \n\nYou're talking about loan regulations, central banks, etc. - that's just one part of the picture, and that's typically after it has been established the asset is acceptable to secure a loan against. But what about when it hasn't yet been established? You have no idea what assets the FIL has, nor the condition, nature, quality, etc. And as I mentioned in my first comment, a blatantly obvious thing is even if we assume the asset is something that typically can be borrowed against, what if it already has loans against it and there is no remaining equity? Are you telling me that as \"someone who works with wealthy people who distribute assets...\" that the amount of equity a person has in their collateral is irrelevant for a loan trying to use said collateral? Come on. \n\nI really don't care about your background or qualifications, because you missing all that relevant context and info prior to agreeing with \"easily borrow\" is relevant regardless of what industry you're in. If anything, it just makes it worse that you would ignore all that detail before assuming a conclusion you should be well aware isn't so cut and dry.", "I didn't think he lived in India anymore, due to him saying he sends his mom money back to his home country. But it doesn't matter if he does or doesn't, or if his FIL is still there. \n\nLoans work essentially the same.", "So you're standing firm to your patronizing response that the FIL\n\n>can easily borrow against them\n\nand do so very, very quickly, since the money is for *surgery*? Even without knowing what assets they are? Their condition or quality? Even the nature of it? Like what if it's an owned small business that is difficult to value? And as I mentioned before even without knowing what assets have already been borrowed against, as if your remaining equity in a form of collateral doesn't matter when you're trying to use that collateral for a loan? LOL ignoring all that detail would be ridiculous, yet there you are. \n\nMaybe FIL can borrow against his assets, maybe he can't. But to declare he most definitely can at this point in time, and can do so easily, without knowing any extremely relevant details is absolutely naive."]}
