You're not going to be able to control his further reproduction. Focus on your relationship with your brother, and it could you can learn not to be the kind of person your father is.", "NTA BUT you need to be ready for the consequences that follow.\n\nThere will be consequences if he is proven to be your brother or if he isn't.

But I must caution you, even with a positive match, your dad won\u2019t acknowledge the paternity as he doesn\u2019t care since inception. You have all have my sympathy as your dad spread his sperm around carelessly.", "NTA. It's your DNA- you can both just do 23 and me or a similar test and compare.", "NTA. If you want to get it to prove to yourself and your brother that you are related by blood that's your choice. \n\nHowever, don't expect that proving proof will magically change your dad's attitude or behavior towards your brother.", "NTA but your dad is. Your poor brother. You\u2019re a better person than I am, I would\u2019ve told the new wife about the brother a long time ago.

So if you want to do it to prove that the 16yo is in fact the not-to-be- mentioned brother for yourself, then do it.

Your Dad is a major A-hole", "Get the DNA test.\n\nOnce it comes to light that you're siblings, I really hope you're brother's mom drags your dad to court for child support, because if your dad really is the father, he's got a lot to make up for.", "NTA but be prepared for collateral damage.", "NTA.

Your relationship with your brother is yours and his business. Anyone else can f themselves, realistically. He's going to be an adult in a couple of years and he's more than old enough to know who his family is, if his mother is open to it, then go for it. This is about you 2, nobody else.", "NTA, everyone deserves to know where they come from and defend themselves against someone so heinous.

At this point I imagine he considers you family regardless of the outcome.\n\nBe his rock. Stand up for him. Make all family aware of his existence. He should be seen and herd.", "NTA\n\nYou are an adult and can do whatever you want in regards to DNA testing. \n\nHowever, if you share the results with your father, be prepared for him not to take it well. He doesn't want to acknowledge the kid and a positive DNA test won't likely change his mind. He's the AH all around. \n\nYou can continue to have a relationship with your brother without involving your dad. Shitty people can have kids and it sucks, but you don't have to let it ruin anything with your brother.", "Here's a novel concept - why don't you just worry about things that you can control and not worry about that which you do not control?\n\nYour dad has made his position on the subject *VERY* clear.  He may not have shared the reason(s) but that is his business, not yours.  He may have very good reason(s) why - who knows, maybe he was sexually assaulted by this boy's mother or was trafficked in some way in his teens.  Maybe it's a story dad is not sharing because of trauma.  You don't know.  And it's not your business to know.\n\nYou don't get to decide what type, if any, relationship your potential brother has with your dad.  That is up to both of them.  You get to decide what type of relationship you have with this kid.  That is on you.  If you want a DNA test to know for sure you are related - go for it.  If you want a DNA test so you can wave the results at your dad triumphantly, you are in for a surprise.\n\nYour dad knows the truth.  He doesn't care or he is afraid of truth.  Either way - he doesn't owe you that story until he is ready and for you to try and do anything else about that *WOULD* make you an AH.\n\nSo check your motives carefully.  Decide if you are willing to lose the relationship with your dad by doing what you decide to do.  You are free to make your choice but you are not free from the consequences of that choice - remember that when the sky falls.", "NTA - you can certainly do the test. As they are a minor they may need their mother's permission - not sure what the T&Cs of the testing companies are. \n\nPlease be aware that these tests can sometimes throw up other surprise relationships and don't go into it expecting your Dad to make any changes or for the brother to be welcomed into the family.\n\nIf there was a suggestion that he do a DNA test 16 years ago but wasn't required to in the end then there may be more to this - I presume a court chasing support could have compelled him to do so.", "NTA. You have a right to see if he is truly your brother, just as you have a right to build a relationship with him. However, your dad wants nothing to do with the kid. He gave up his right and moved on with his life. It\u2019s sad and but it\u2019s his choice. This probably won\u2019t chance your dads opinion at all.", "You're gonna throw DNA tests around when it's clear your dad's trying to move on? Meddling in your dad's life and judging his choices?
