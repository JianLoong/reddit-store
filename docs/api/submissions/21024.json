It can take several attempts (on average, 7 attempts) to leave before it finally sticks. \n\nI think that you can support your sister while also setting a boundary. Tell her that you love her, you want her to be safe and happy, you want her child to be safe and happy, and you will do whatever it takes to help her achieve that when she finally decides to leave for good.

''I have been the one made aware of his shortcomings the entire relationship''", "I think this is the best comment here. Others are saying that your (OP) sister is an adult and has chosen to go back, so she should be on her own. But what they aren\u2019t considering is the fact that for abuse victims it\u2019s very hard to leave, and going back to the abuser is common for victims but that doesn\u2019t mean they truly truly want to \u2014 it\u2019s all just so complicated. And it doesn\u2019t help when victims don\u2019t have a full support system. You were there for your sister but your other finally members aren\u2019t which can make things harder for victims to leave. Your family has to be with you too, OP, and agree to put their own effort into helping too. BUT WITH THAT SAID, you are also allowed to set your own boundaries. You\u2019re feelings surrounding this is valid and I am so sorry that you have to witness your sister go through this and that your family berated you for caring. As the above comment said, perhaps leave your door open just in case, but definitely prioritize yourself too. Take care of yourself and do what you need to be in a good place. But I also commend you OP for doing all this for your sister. You are a really good human being that also deserves rest and time to heal as well.", "Well said.", "I concur. \n\nSometimes you have to save yourself from other peoples relationships. Especially those that invite others in when they\u2019re having \u2018tough\u2019 time and shut everyone out when they go back.", "Nephew too, it's not good for him to constantly watch his parents dance the toxic relationship tango either.", "Or 'In the old days, we didn't just give up on a marriage. We stayed together, worked hard on it and made it work...'", "And they're not unreasonable for that (gets real hard to leave an abuser if everyone's already left you because they're fed up with the abuser), but neither are you for having boundaries. It's an incredibly tough situation for you, and I'm surprised at the amount of awful advice from people with a poor understanding of leaving family violence below.", "They said it themselves, she has the baby. They\u2019ll support whatever fucked decisions she makes as long they get to see the baby.", "Yes! Where are whole books about how to support an abused woman and how to cope with your own feelings about it. \u201cWhy does he do that\u201d has a fantastic list of resources. \n\nhttps://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf"]}
