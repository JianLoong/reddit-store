You've been supportive like a good sister, and it is mentally draining.  You cannot save her. Only she can save herself, but you can save YOURSELF.", "OP you cannot help her - no one can.  Your family members are choosing to let her be, although they are aware of the situation.  The best suggestion is likely just taking a break from your family and all of the drama that is coming with it.  Focus on your mental health, not worry about what's going on since there's no helping anyone at this point in time, and consider enjoying the positive things in life since you've had to manage dealing with so much negativity for so long.  When you spend so much energy focusing on others, people forget to get it replenished with positivity again.", "Your family seems kinda fucked up to support your sister taking a child back into that situation. I mean, she\u2019s taking a kid back to someone who uses drugs? Jesus people only a dumbass would support that. What the hell am I missing?", "NTA  I can understand why you were sobbing. It's a really bad situation for everyone and I hate that your sister is going back. You have every right to draw this boundary.", "NTA because from what you say you're not trying to influence her behaviour you're just changing your own. I think it's valid to no longer be able to invest emotionally in the situation.", "No! Not extreme. I used to have a similar situation only with a best friend of aaaalllooottt of years. He cheated the entire duration of their whole marriage. He even tried to hit on me. Which I told her immediately! Anyway\u2026she cut all contact with me once the woman that he was having the affair with died. And She Got Back With Him???!!! Because I was the toxic one to stand up for her for years! Some people just can\u2019t help but go back to the toxicity because it was either ingrained into them or they are just deluded in their belief of \u201cI love him, and I know he loves me\u201d mentality. Let her make her own mistakes. But yes refuse to listen to it any longer. She must reach her own bottom. And in that case, support. But not until then.", "NTA. OP you are entitled to your opinion but at this juncture your sister has made her decision so you need to keep your opinions to yourself. Use this time to reflect on your life and recover and save the money you have been contributing to your sister. As soon as you can find a suitable place to move into and get away from your mother and brother. You don\u2019t deserve their scorn. I know this is hard not is it what you want to hear but think about what I\u2019ve suggested. Good luck!", "NTA. The only thing I\u2019ll say as advice here is that if your sister is in an abusive relationship, then you should leave the door open for her to come back. \n\nAbusive relationships go through cycles - he\u2019s probably apologized a ton, told her he loves her, promised to change, etc. It\u2019s incredibly hard to leave, especially when you are tied to someone by having a child with them and also by being financially dependent on them, which it sounds like your sister is. It can take several attempts (on average, 7 attempts) to leave before it finally sticks. \n\nI think that you can support your sister while also setting a boundary. Tell her that you love her, you want her to be safe and happy, you want her child to be safe and happy, and you will do whatever it takes to help her achieve that when she finally decides to leave for good. You can tell her that you can\u2019t be a part of it as long as she\u2019s with him, and that you will be waiting for her with open arms when she\u2019s ready.", "Oh shit your family sucks", "NTA because you are watching someone you love get hurt repeatedly and profoundly. There's only so much of that a person can take.", "NTA\nIf he is abusive to the kids, contact CPS and tell them. Maybe they can at least get the children out of reach of this abuser.", "NTA, you shouldn't need to support her being with him, but I'm unsure why you wouldn't want to see your family just to avoid him? you could just flat out ignore him ?", "NTA", "I still remember the only time I ever hit someone first. It was in high school and it was a boy who shoved my sister against a wall. JS,I know what it feels like to love a sib seemingly more than they love themselves sometimes. \n\nIf it was just her,I would tell you to let her screw her life up over this dick if she wants,but she has *a child* that doesn\u2019t have a choice. Maybe she\u2019s a dim witted dishrag that likes this abuse,but (if you can emotionally take it) you might want to keep a toe in the water for *his* sake. If this sickening disfunction is going to continue,he\u2019s going to need somebody. Given the fact that your family seems clueless,I\u2019m thinking his aunt might be the one to help him along. Like you *tried* to do for his mom.", "NAH. Your BIL treated your sister like sh**, and needs to prove it not just to her, but to her whole family that he\u2019s improved. Your mom and brother have a right to choose to offer your sister unconditional love and support to make sure she doesn\u2019t feel trapped or isolated.", "NTA, move on with your life. Go totally no contact with them.  When it comes time to pick up the pieces - DON'T.  You can only do so much.  You have been there to help, and this is the way you get treated.", "Ok... i hate say it but as a single mother she has a relatively poor set of prospects... and he may be the best choice given he will be involved anyhow.", "YTA\n\nSupporting your sister means you also support her when she makes choices you don't agree with. It's her relationship and her decision.", "This is a really tough one.  Leaning toward YTA unless you have more evidence of abuse.
