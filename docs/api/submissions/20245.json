I said these things during dinner yesterday and Audrey herself was just smiling as she always does when I tease her.\n\nOut of nowhere my mom tells me to stop disrespecting Audrey in front of everyone. She has the tendency to think of the worst and act like a volcano for no reason at all. I said I am clearly not disrespecting her because I am still alive, and if I did, Jade would probably cut me in half. She said I needed to stop this childish behavior. Audrey said it didn't cause her any trouble, Jade said it was fine, but mom said it was her home and she didnt want any of her guests to be uncomfirtable. I said then maybe she should stop making these jokes about herself and let her guests enjoy their time together. My dad also picked her side and the enire evening was awkward.\n\nMy mom has sent me a lengthy text saying how it was rude of me to disrespect her at her own home.

What part of this is a fun joke? Explain it please because as someone similar in personality and skin tone I don\u2019t get it. Why is her not being like you a joke?  You go on to needle her about physical affection, something she\u2019s clearly uncomfortable with. Again, how is this a fun joke?
