We were best friends growing up, and we are still very close to this day. Jade married her wife (Audrey 27F) last summer after dating for 3 years. \n\nFor as long as I've known her, Audrey has been this serious person that is all about business with little sense of humor. I mean it is understandable because her family of origin really wanted this for her. Jade doesn't share much about her marriage but it is obvious that Audrey keeps a distance from everyone. I understand that and love her because Jade hasn't been happier.\n\nNow, back to the event. I dropped off my son (Liam - 8M) at his aunts' place to go on a trip with my wife for two weeks. This was 2 months ago. Liam adores Jade and was happy to be staying with his aunties. Jade would update us and send us a few pictures every day, and it was lovely to see Audrey as involved in the whole process as Jade was. She has a busy schedule but she was there having a blast with Liam in every photo.\n\nAfter we got back, I learned that Liam and Audrey had formed a 'secret friendship' because apparently he was the first family member from our side that met her. They kept it a secret for the sake of fun and mystery and would have fun together every time I dropped him off with them. Now they felt like they wanted to be a new kind of team and are sharing this with us.\n\nI thought it was really cute and I started teasing Audrey ever since by saying things like 'even vampires have a lot ot love to give (I call her a vamp cause she's pale)' or 'Liam's been telling me you give pretty good hugs (She doesn't even hug Jade when she's hanging with us)'. I said these things during dinner yesterday and Audrey herself was just smiling as she always does when I tease her.\n\nOut of nowhere my mom tells me to stop disrespecting Audrey in front of everyone. She has the tendency to think of the worst and act like a volcano for no reason at all. I said I am clearly not disrespecting her because I am still alive, and if I did, Jade would probably cut me in half. She said I needed to stop this childish behavior. Audrey said it didn't cause her any trouble, Jade said it was fine, but mom said it was her home and she didnt want any of her guests to be uncomfirtable. I said then maybe she should stop making these jokes about herself and let her guests enjoy their time together. My dad also picked her side and the enire evening was awkward.\n\nMy mom has sent me a lengthy text saying how it was rude of me to disrespect her at her own home. I kind of felt bad afterwards and wanted to see if what I did was indeed AH behavior. Pleade tell me if I was being a prick.

I\u2019m embarrassed for you, but don\u2019t think it necessarily makes you an AH.", "NTA\n\nConditionally. As long as Aubrey was *actually* happy with the teasing then your mom was reacting over nothing.\n\nThat being said, I am sympathetic towards your mom. I've been in the situation before where one person was \"friendly\" teasing and the other person was uncomfortable. It can be difficult to navigate.\n\nIMO a better strategy is to try to ask the person themselves whether they are happy with the teasing. If they say yes then there is no problem. If they say no then you can ask if it would be helpful for you to intervene.", "I\u2019m leaning toward YTA here.\n\nFirst, you should have asked Audrey before if she was really okay with the teasing IN PRIVATE. The dinner table is not the place for that.\n\nSecond, if you knew your mother was the type to get offended at these types of comments, you should have kept it for yourself, at least during dinner and when she told you to stop, you should of apologize and stop teasing Audrey. It\u2019s not very difficult to be respectful, at least for dinner. This was not the place, nor the time to make these comments.", "It really depends. I\u2019m teasing like this \u00c0 LOT with my sister. My dad hates this. I\u2019ve asked her a million times if she\u2019s ok with it, both in private and public, and she seems to be. Also, when she doesn\u2019t like something I do she usually tells me to cut it out so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s lying. The teasing is also reciprocated. \n\nHowever, I could easily see Audrey just smiling to keep the peace. If I were you I\u2019d go up to her in private and ask her if she\u2019s ok. If she\u2019s not, apologize sincerely and never do it again.", "YTA based on how you describe her and the not so hidden judgement of her personality. Throughout this post you imply there\u2019s something wrong with how she is as a person. Some people are just reserved, which makes it a lot more uncomfortable for them when you take the the vulnerable parts they do share and turn it into some joke. \u201cEven vampires have a lot of love to give\u201d is both a judgement on her physical appearance (why is this necessary? it\u2019s an entirely unoriginal and annoying joke or make about a pale persons skin, I guarantee she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s nearly as funny as you do) and implies that because she is reserved she is somehow incapable of feeling. What part of this is a fun joke? Explain it please because as someone similar in personality and skin tone I don\u2019t get it. Why is her not being like you a joke?  You go on to needle her about physical affection, something she\u2019s clearly uncomfortable with. Again, how is this a fun joke? Why are you going out of your way to make risk making her uncomfortable? She says it\u2019s fine at the table but given what you\u2019ve shared about her personality why would she say anything different and put even more focus on it?", "From my personal experience, my brother-in-law has been making jokes at my expense for 25 years.  They were actually all harmless on their own, but it added up.  There were also some evergreens that he has been telling for 25 years.  At first I laughed, then at some point I stopped.  I've tried talking to him sincerely, shooting back jokes, or just ignoring him.  It was all useless.  We have now cut off contact.  I couldn't stand his presence anymore.\n\nI would like to know what you want to achieve with these jokes?  You describe her as a sincere and reserved person.  Are you really sure that she's not just laughing out of politeness or helplessness?\n\nIf you're not careful, she prefers to see you from behind in the future.  These jokes at other people's expense are very dangerous. I lean very much towards your mother's opinion.\n\nYTA", "YTA pretty sure your mom is worried that you\u2019ll cross the line and what little progress has been made to connect with Audrey will be ruined. You should have backed off. The jokes weren\u2019t even funny.", "YTA - please read all of this\n\nIt sounds like you were making jokes you've made before but because your mom is there and you are in their house its a problem.\n\nThere is a problem with this tho:\n\n>Audrey said it didn't cause her any trouble, Jade said it was fine, but she said it was her home and she didnt want any of her guests to be uncomfirtable. I said then maybe she should stop making these jokes about herself and let her guests enjoy their time together.

Why rip into Audrey then?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour mom is a controlling AH.", "YTA-dude teasing someone because there friends with your kid why? What\u2019s the point even if she said she was fine she was trying most likely to fit in and isn\u2019t ok with it I think your mom noticed this and was trying to defend Audrey. so yes your the asshole and owe Audrey an apology.", "NTA Your mother acted over the top for no reason.", "NTA..  I don't see anything wrong with what you said and if Audrey was unhappy, then SHE should have been the one to say something.  You mother put herself into a conversation she knew nothing about", "Soft YTA\n\nThere was a time when a little joking around with family was not only welcomed, but expected.  Where people had thicker skin and weren't turned off by being the brunt of a joke from time to time.  Your mom seems to have forgotten that, as does most of Reddit on any given day.\n\nAt the same time, your mom did ask you to stop.  You escalated.  That's the only part I see you as an asshole.", "YTA \n\nJokes are not funny, and I see Audrey smiling not to make a scene but I don\u2019t think she enjoys that. \nUsually jokes at someone else expense are bullying or very close to it and only person making jokes enjoys it.
