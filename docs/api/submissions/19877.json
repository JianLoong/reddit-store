Of course you don't want to reach out to the man who together with your mom tore you family apart. He's not your dad.

That said if not him it could have easily been a other man since mom didn't mind cheating.\n\nYou should reach out to your father and spend time with him, give him a mea ingful gift and tell mom, Just because we can get along after all you two have done doesn't mean you have the right to demand I treat your affair partner like my dad.", "NTA- but your mom is for thinking she can have any type of control over the relationship you have or dont have with step dad.", "Stepparents day is September 16th.

I will be giving him the same level of effort. If I feel like it, I might tell him happy stepparents day in September, but you can kiss that compromise goodbye if you argue with me about this.
