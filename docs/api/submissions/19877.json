You have absolutely every right not to want to wish your step-dad a happy Father's Day, especially given your reasons.\n\nMy dad died when I was young and my subsequent stepfather bullied me for years until I finally turned around and stood up to him - it took me around 17 years to do it, but I was sick of hearing, \"Oh  that's just (stepfather's name), that's just how he is.\" How he was was not okay.\n\nStick to your guns, OP, and do what's right for you. Your mum did what she felt was right for her, after all.", "\u201cAffair Partner\u2019s Day is February 31.\u201d\n\nNTA. Sounds like he wants support when he needs it but was unwilling to do his part for you when you were a kid. Too bad so sad.", "I'm sure you were just as civil to your mom & step-dad growing up. It's hard to make a judgement on this one.", "NTA, but only on the strength of  having a bad relationship with step-dad. People, step-parents deserve \"parent's day\" acknowledgement, too. \"Not my real dad,\" on its own, isn't a reason to exclude a step-parent. OP, try to take an objective view of your relationship before you dimiss it. You admit to being a pretty big contributor to the friction in your relationship, maybe a bit of re-evaluation is in order?", "NTA he never treated you like a son, so why would you act like he was any kind of a good dad to you?", "NTA.", "NTA for how you feel.  You are within your rights to do whatever you want.  We have no idea what came first, your rebellious behavior that resulted in arguments and punishments or the harshness from your stepdad that led to your rebellion.  Either way he provided for you in some way during part of your youth.  \n\nThe way you say your mom asked seemed from her heart.  No problem with her expressing her feelings, especially in such a manner.  Why don't you express your feelings in the same calm manner.  Then leave it at that.  Just know that you have the opportunity to be kind, and you don't know what difference that can make even to someone you think doesn't deserve it.", "My father was an abusive alcoholic\u2026 he made the lives of my mother and his kids miserable.\nI loved my mother dearly though and felt the opposite for him. \n\nBut for some reason she would call us up asking us to remember his birthday or him on Father\u2019s Day. \nShe was soft hearted like that. \n\nI always told her absolutely not. \nI asked her where was he on all of my birthdays? \nWhere was he on her birthdays or any of my sibling\u2019s birthdays? \n\nSo my answer was always no, absolutely not!\n\nOP you have zero obligation to acknowledge your stepfather on Father\u2019s Day. And you should feel zero guilt about that.\nNTA", "He doesn\u2019t deserve anything then either.", "It\u2019s so low effort though that I am wondering what never nice means. OP says they were a rebellious teen but kind of downplays what that means. Does never nice mean stepdad was abusive or does it mean he wouldn\u2019t let OP drink his liquor cabinet.", "Exactly one month away! Plenty of time for OP to plan.", "Sigh, I\u2019m in the same boat. Don\u2019t send the text if it isn\u2019t genuine. Did he care about your feelings in the past? If not, you shouldn\u2019t be expected to care about his around Fathers Day.", "NTA. I'm a little biased because I also have a step dad who was I guess there in a sense but he's always been a narcissistic jack ass so we only have a surface relationship. Imo you shouldn't have to tell anyone happy \"insert holiday\" if you don't actually mean it.", "YTA\n\nDo you not with any other man on the planet, other than your father, \u201cHappy Fathers Day\u201d? Friends, friends parents, grandparents, uncles, strangers\u2026people whom you know are fathers. You don\u2019t say Happy Fathers Day to anyone, ever? Seriously, it\u2019s 3 words. Say it and move on. Be spiteful another day.", "Regardless of if he is your dad, stepdad, a complete stranger or whatever no one can demand you reach out to someone. She can ask but you are totally allowed to say no for no reason other than you don't want to. You are in charge of yourself and anyone trying to dictate your behavior to you is out of line.", "You obviously don't have to do anything you don't feel in your heart and thus choose not to do. The only question is do you tell her why you don't want to do this?", "NTA. Just don't do it. Explain it like you did on here when she asks why. They don't get that you reap when you sow.\n\nEdited to change spelling", "NTA fun fact, if you treat children in your life like crap they will in fact remember that once they\u2019re adults.", "From someone with step parents. NTA", "To be fair enough I don't think he deserves it. Going out of your way to disrupt children's lives when they are young doesn't give him a right to well wishes just because you were present", "NTA.\n\nSet the boundary with mom now.", "Ask your mother if she has raised a liar. Because that is what you would have to do in order to wish him a happy Father\u2019s Day.", "So I was thinking maybe you should as a 'just to be nice' thing. I tell my step parents happy mother's or father's day but they were not a part of why my parents divorced. Holy shit NTA", "NTA. Why would you wish a happy Father's Day to the person who cheated with your mom and hurt your actual dad? Your mom and step dad must be delusional to think thats normal", "Tell your mom that if there is ever an \"adultery day\" in the future, you will call him and wish him happy adultery day.  Until then, NTA.", "NTA and of course do what you want, 100%. You don't owe him anything. But if you want to preserve the cordial-but-distant thing you've got going on, buy a card, sign your name inside (no added message) and pop it in the mail as a low-cost way of avoiding having to hash this shit out. On the other hand, if you want to get all this out and tell your parents how you feel, \\*\\*do it\\*\\*.", "NTA, Yeah, just tell your mom you'll reach out and wish him a happy adulterer's day when it rolls around.", "Honestly I would not even answer that much. A simple \"No.\" would do just as well in my opinion. It's very hard to argue against it. If the mother tries to argue, just answer \"No.\" again until she stops.", "Colored toilet paper.", "nta"]}
