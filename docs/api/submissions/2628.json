I\u2019m going to tell you what it took me too long to learn. He is always going to be like this because so far he\u2019s gotten away with it and he thinks he can just coast on his significant others good graces.\n\nDitch the guy and enjoy your solo trip.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Don't buy him a ticket.\nIf he flakes, you can't get a refund, the refund goes to the ticket holder.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. How did this trip become all about him ? Go solo !", "NTA, he\u2019s already complaining about the dates.  Ask for his credit card to book his ticket for him.  If he complains, tell him you\u2019ll book both tickets with his card, and you will pay him back.  \n\nOr better yet, leave him at home, he sounds exhausting.", "NTA. \n\nYou have your reasons and the bottom line is that you don\u2019t want to buy his ticket. He should respect that. I don\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t buy his own. It\u2019s not like you ever said you would pay his way and just because his last girlfriends did it doesn\u2019t mean you should. You can book the same flight even if you did it separately so why does he care so much?", "hello his previous girlfriends brought him tickets?? \n\nWell were you aware he is a sugar baby?\n\nYou did well in not booking for him and this is such a major RED FLAG NTA \n\ngo alone or with someone who doesn't feel entitled to your money", "It makes sense to book the tickets together if you are travelling together. You have more chance of being seated together and the delays, getting bumped etc will affect you the same. Also you are guaranteed that you are actually booking tickets on the same flight. \n\nThat said, it sounds like you are concerned that he will bail and not pay? So he can book the flights and you pay him back or he can pay you up front and then you book them. \n\nIt sounds like you really want to go and he's iffy so just ask him to pay up front.", "NTA\n\nI would be willing to book his ticket so I canale sure my partner is on the same flight that's and has seats with me.  But I sure as heck would insist that he buy his own tickets.\n\nThis guy asking to join your trip and then expecting you to pay for his tickets and trying to change your trip dates is a huge red flag.  You don't need to pay for the privilege of anyone's company.  If you let her m go, he'll probably also expect you to pay for all accomodations since you would have paid for the room for yourself anyway.  And he's not going to do some of the activities you're interested in and try to get you to change those plans.\n\nAnyone who wants to go on a trip you're planning needs to pay for their own flights, accomodations, food, tours, trip insurance, spending money, etc... And they need to voice their interests for tours and activities during the planning stages because you're not giving up your plans without an extremely good reason (illness, weather, etc...).\n\nBook your trip.  Tell BF that if he wants to go, he needs to pay his own way.  Then, don't discuss the trip with him further until/unless he buys his airfare.  (Also, he needs to pay you ahead for f time for his share of housing.)", "NTA\n\n\"He told me his previous girlfriends would buy him tickets for joint trips.\"  \n\nWell now you know why they are exes.  His entitlement is astounding.", "INFO: Is he not willing to pay? is he not financially stable? Can you take a deposit from him? Is he continuously unreliable? Does he bail on plans? Because you're insinuating that he may do all these things without telling us you have probable cause to believe it all.\n\nDealing with his personal info in my opinion is not an excuse because what does that even mean? I don't understand how it's difficult to enter his info and order the tickets if he provides you with it?\n\n\nEdit: rereading this it sounds like you don't even MIND paying for the tickets but you just don't want to actually book them for him? I'd ask why? My boyfriend planned a joint trip for us and he took care of all the booking. This isn't a crazy ask and it doesn't mean you're his personal assistant. It's basic kindness. If you're willing to take him with you AND pay. How hard is booking his ticket? You're already on the website booking YOUR ticket. Do you even like him. I'm very much leaning towards Y T A", "So Im judging based on these reasons \n\n>I didn't want to book tickets for him because\r  \n\r  \nI'm not his personal assistant\r  \n\r  \nHe's unpredictable and he could drop out and leave me with $1000 spare ticket\r  \n\r  \nI prefer not to have to deal with his personal data when booking flights\n\n1) Thats an awful reason. You are not his personal assistant but you are his girlfriend.\n\n2) This isnt a good reason either. Because immediately thereafter you mentioned this isnt a money issue and you can easily afford the tickets.\n\n3) There really is no significant personal data involved. And again, as a girlfriend, I'm not sure what exactly you are avoiding.\n\nYTA \n\nFor your information, I have booked 4 flights for my girlfriend and I thus far. Its not really an issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

She doesn\u2019t owe him a ticket. It\u2019s not like she planned a surprise trip for both of them, he\u2019s basically tagging along on a trip she already planned.", "He is trying to argue the dates on a trip SHE is going on, she clearly doesn\u2019t trust him 100% yet which would make perfect sense in a new relationship", "Not necessarily. They are long distance - so she\u2019s used to doing a lot without him. She also is aware he doesn\u2019t particularly like to travel.
