She got upset after I fake kidnapped her 2 young kids. \nNow I know it sounds harsh so far but the reason I did it was to finally get though her head the dangers of leaving her kids home alone when she goes out. \n\nOn top of the dangers she just recently split up with her husband and they are currently going through a custody battle. The kids live with her but the dad is fighting to get them to live with him a city over. She knows any ammunition this man can get will be used against her in court and I have told her a million times that if he finds out she leaves the kids at home to run 5-10 minute errands she absolutely will loose come court time. \n\nThe kids are 5 and 8 years old. Sure they are quite capable for 10 minutes but I told her that is not the point. Countless times I would come over, the door was unlocked so I walk right in and her kids are home alone. She shows up 5 minutes later stating it was easier to run for milk without the kids or whatever she is doing at the time. \n\nI tell her for gods sake at least lock the door so a stranger can\u2019t walk in and I honestly worry what would happen if a fire started. This leads to today. I was on my way over and I see her drive past me. She didn\u2019t see me or know I was on the way so I get this great idea to teach her a lesson. I go to her house and tell the kids to get into my car we are going to go for a little drive (they drive with me often so going for a drive is nothing new). We get into the car and go park just down the street where I could see her get back. Sure enough 5 minutes later she is back at the house and sees the door is open. I wait a minute and see her run outside then head towards the back yard then run back inside again clearly in a panic. So I drive back up to the house and run inside to find her crying uncontrollably and shaking in a panic. I was kind of smiling like hey it\u2019s okay your kids are with me but she could not stop crying. \n\nFinally after about half hour she calms down enough to question why I did this and after explaining asks me to leave so I did.

My mom used to leave my brother and I home alone at that age and we were fine BUT we were told to keep the door locked and never answer it for anybody. We also knew to call 911 if anything happened. OP doesn't mention any of that aside from leaving the door unlocked. \n\nOP is 100% an asshole and I'd be calling the cops for kidnapping anyway. Still doesn't excuse mom *not* locking the door at least", "They don\u2019t need to be left for hours for something terrible to happen, as OP demonstrated (extremely inappropriately, mind you).", "All it takes is one of them chokes on food or there\u2019s a fluke electrical fire, or they get injured, I\u2019m sure they can just wait until mom is home!  I am far from a helicopter parent but this is absolutely something that would have her dealing with state child authorities. Mom could get in an accident on her way to get milk what happens then? Culture aside courts would not find this ok. OP\u2019s still an AH though.", "It\u2019s not safe. What if something happened to her while she was out of the house? No one would know those kids were home alone.", "Yeah, but OP is right that she should lock the door when she leaves. Maybe keep a window or something unlocked so the kids can get out in case of emergency, but don't just leave the front door unlocked so someone like OP can walk in and take the kids.", "Exactly, I don\u2019t wanna \u201dI was left with my sister when I was 8 and I\u2019m fine\u201d but I was and we are. Haven\u2019t parents taught their kids not to burn the house down, play with the stove and how to reach her by that age? I\u2019m so confused by the people wanting CPS to take her kids for this it\u2019s absolutely insane to me and seems awfully cruel.", "Idk about calling CPS but a 5 year old shouldn\u2019t be left without adult supervision. An 8 year old can be left alone just fine, but an 8 year old should not be the only person responsible for a 5 year old.", "But that ISN'T THE ACTION THAT OP TOOK. She KIDNAPPED CHILDREN. Which is why she is an asshole. \n\nAnd again, we can agree to disagree on the fact that their safety is jeopardized. Personally I'd intervene if I saw a child being kidnapped, but I wouldn't intervene if I saw someone leave their school aged children alone for ten minutes and under. But I live somewhere where there is no minimum age that a child can be left alone. Itnis up to the parent's discretion.", "Btw I just checked and in most US states its legal to leave an 8 year old home alone. Also Quebec does not have age restrictions about that", "I'm not saying you're wrong, but the mom's actions aren't what's being judged. Op faked a kidnapping of the mom's children. I happen to have a kid on the way, and if any of my friends did that with my child, no matter the circumstances, I would disown them as a friend. There are far better ways to get the point across. She could have just called the dad, since she was already ready to literally kidnap the kids.", "So question: When you went in to tell her her kids were with you, doesn't that mean you ALSO left them in your car? Alone? What did you intend to do if someone else kidnapped them out of your car? You do realize if you say \"The door was locked,\" that means you kept children in a locked car. If you say, \"The door was unlocked,\" that means you were a hypocrite.", "Haha i would love to hear you tell a judge or jury that lol.", "My mum used to leave my brother and I at home while she and my dad went across the road to the neighbours. It was super normal in the 90s, but these days, all I can think about is Maddie McCann. It can happen so fast; it doesn\u2019t need hours; 5-10 minutes is plenty of time for something to go horribly wrong.", "What? What's the mom going to do if she needs to go to the bathroom, or needs to spend 10 minutes focused on cooking and the kids are in another room where the kitchen knives aren't, unsuperviced?", "But she has a ex husband and friends who would be informed and would come and take care of her kids. If she runs errands she has her wallet with her drivers license to identify her etc.", "I'm not arguing your verdict?!", "Calling the dad would have resulted in the mom loosing custody and probably getting arrested for child endangerment. Maybe the mom deserves it for not being able to understand the potential danger she put her children in. Is that what you want? \nAnd yes, we\u2019re judging the moms actions too. OP did not act in a vacuum, she responded to a situation created by the mom. By saying OP is not TA we\u2019re saying her action was less worse than the mom (and yes, I know it\u2019s not grammatical but I don\u2019t think better fits here). And in reverse, if we say that OP is TA, then we\u2019re saying that her action was worse than mom\u2019s.\n\nIn reality, I think that\u2019s the best example of ESH.", "No the kids were right behind me they are at the age where they can get out of their seats on their own. What you are describing is not the same thing.", "House fires can kill in under a minute. Though it's good to know that possessing a driving licence could save them. You are focusing on specific examples when the main point is that leaving a 5 and 8 yr old alone is dangerous.", "The verdict isn't the only point I'm making here. We have differing opinions on if what the mom is doing is endangerment. In my state, it isn't.", "Normally I would agree with you on ESH, but op's actions could very well have handed the dad all the ammo he needed for the custody hearing, assuming his lawyers know about the incident. Imo, that makes her a bigger ah. She was so concerned about helping friend not giving the ex the edge he needed, and instead gave it him on a platter.", "Why is that not the same thing? If they can get out of their seat, what if they saw a friend from school across the street and (god forbid) decided to run out of the car into oncoming traffic?", "We can agree to disagree. I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s the best decision. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth subjecting kids to the mercy of cps either.", "And it is not the point I disagreed with, which is what the quote is for. \n\nLegaly, maybe. We don't know where she is. Common-sense wise, leaving a 5 nad 8 year old alone, with the doors unlocked is endangerment. All that needs to happen is an accident along the way and boom, she's gone an hour instead of 10 minutes. It's stupid behaviour. \n\nI've worked with kids in that age group for years. They can get themselves injured in less than 5 minutes without even trying - they just decide they want something from the top shelf or to run with scissors/pencils.", "Cps is going to place those kids with their dad.  Also since custody is not yet established the father has just as much right to those kids as this mother.", "Oh jesus, you aren't even a parent.", "Once again, I\u2019m speaking generally. Like if anyone was in this situation. Not everyone has a dad they can be placed with. \n\nAnd either way that doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be a scarring situation for the kids.", "Yeah, because that renders my opinion null and void \ud83d\ude44"]}
