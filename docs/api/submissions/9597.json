She got upset after I fake kidnapped her 2 young kids. \nNow I know it sounds harsh so far but the reason I did it was to finally get though her head the dangers of leaving her kids home alone when she goes out. \n\nOn top of the dangers she just recently split up with her husband and they are currently going through a custody battle. The kids live with her but the dad is fighting to get them to live with him a city over. She knows any ammunition this man can get will be used against her in court and I have told her a million times that if he finds out she leaves the kids at home to run 5-10 minute errands she absolutely will loose come court time. \n\nThe kids are 5 and 8 years old. Sure they are quite capable for 10 minutes but I told her that is not the point. Countless times I would come over, the door was unlocked so I walk right in and her kids are home alone. She shows up 5 minutes later stating it was easier to run for milk without the kids or whatever she is doing at the time. \n\nI tell her for gods sake at least lock the door so a stranger can\u2019t walk in and I honestly worry what would happen if a fire started. This leads to today. I was on my way over and I see her drive past me. She didn\u2019t see me or know I was on the way so I get this great idea to teach her a lesson. I go to her house and tell the kids to get into my car we are going to go for a little drive (they drive with me often so going for a drive is nothing new). We get into the car and go park just down the street where I could see her get back. Sure enough 5 minutes later she is back at the house and sees the door is open. I wait a minute and see her run outside then head towards the back yard then run back inside again clearly in a panic. So I drive back up to the house and run inside to find her crying uncontrollably and shaking in a panic. I was kind of smiling like hey it\u2019s okay your kids are with me but she could not stop crying. \n\nFinally after about half hour she calms down enough to question why I did this and after explaining asks me to leave so I did. She texted me after saying how cruel that was and that I was an asshole and now isn\u2019t replying to texts. \nSo reddit am I an asshole?", "created_utc": 1676006462, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yh4bp/aita_for_fake_kidnapping_my_friends_kids/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
