She got upset after I fake kidnapped her 2 young kids. \nNow I know it sounds harsh so far but the reason I did it was to finally get though her head the dangers of leaving her kids home alone when she goes out. \n\nOn top of the dangers she just recently split up with her husband and they are currently going through a custody battle. The kids live with her but the dad is fighting to get them to live with him a city over. She knows any ammunition this man can get will be used against her in court and I have told her a million times that if he finds out she leaves the kids at home to run 5-10 minute errands she absolutely will loose come court time. \n\nThe kids are 5 and 8 years old. Sure they are quite capable for 10 minutes but I told her that is not the point. Countless times I would come over, the door was unlocked so I walk right in and her kids are home alone. She shows up 5 minutes later stating it was easier to run for milk without the kids or whatever she is doing at the time. \n\nI tell her for gods sake at least lock the door so a stranger can\u2019t walk in and I honestly worry what would happen if a fire started. This leads to today. I was on my way over and I see her drive past me. She didn\u2019t see me or know I was on the way so I get this great idea to teach her a lesson. I go to her house and tell the kids to get into my car we are going to go for a little drive (they drive with me often so going for a drive is nothing new). We get into the car and go park just down the street where I could see her get back. Sure enough 5 minutes later she is back at the house and sees the door is open. I wait a minute and see her run outside then head towards the back yard then run back inside again clearly in a panic. So I drive back up to the house and run inside to find her crying uncontrollably and shaking in a panic. I was kind of smiling like hey it\u2019s okay your kids are with me but she could not stop crying. \n\nFinally after about half hour she calms down enough to question why I did this and after explaining asks me to leave so I did.

The courts won't allow \"I only kidnapped them as a le epic prank\" as a defense to kidnapping.", "If she's leaving the door unlocked I'd argue it isn't safe. My mom used to leave my brother and I home alone at that age and we were fine BUT we were told to keep the door locked and never answer it for anybody. We also knew to call 911 if anything happened. OP doesn't mention any of that aside from leaving the door unlocked. \n\nOP is 100% an asshole and I'd be calling the cops for kidnapping anyway. Still doesn't excuse mom *not* locking the door at least", "They don\u2019t need to be left for hours for something terrible to happen, as OP demonstrated (extremely inappropriately, mind you).", "All it takes is one of them chokes on food or there\u2019s a fluke electrical fire, or they get injured, I\u2019m sure they can just wait until mom is home!  I am far from a helicopter parent but this is absolutely something that would have her dealing with state child authorities. Mom could get in an accident on her way to get milk what happens then? Culture aside courts would not find this ok. OP\u2019s still an AH though.", "It\u2019s not safe. What if something happened to her while she was out of the house? No one would know those kids were home alone.", "Yeah, but OP is right that she should lock the door when she leaves. Maybe keep a window or something unlocked so the kids can get out in case of emergency, but don't just leave the front door unlocked so someone like OP can walk in and take the kids.", "Exactly, I don\u2019t wanna \u201dI was left with my sister when I was 8 and I\u2019m fine\u201d but I was and we are. Haven\u2019t parents taught their kids not to burn the house down, play with the stove and how to reach her by that age? I\u2019m so confused by the people wanting CPS to take her kids for this it\u2019s absolutely insane to me and seems awfully cruel.", "Idk about calling CPS but a 5 year old shouldn\u2019t be left without adult supervision. An 8 year old can be left alone just fine, but an 8 year old should not be the only person responsible for a 5 year old.", "But that ISN'T THE ACTION THAT OP TOOK. She KIDNAPPED CHILDREN. Which is why she is an asshole. \n\nAnd again, we can agree to disagree on the fact that their safety is jeopardized. Personally I'd intervene if I saw a child being kidnapped, but I wouldn't intervene if I saw someone leave their school aged children alone for ten minutes and under. But I live somewhere where there is no minimum age that a child can be left alone. Itnis up to the parent's discretion.", "Btw I just checked and in most US states its legal to leave an 8 year old home alone. Also Quebec does not have age restrictions about that", "I'm not saying you're wrong, but the mom's actions aren't what's being judged. Op faked a kidnapping of the mom's children. I happen to have a kid on the way, and if any of my friends did that with my child, no matter the circumstances, I would disown them as a friend. There are far better ways to get the point across. She could have just called the dad, since she was already ready to literally kidnap the kids.", "So question: When you went in to tell her her kids were with you, doesn't that mean you ALSO left them in your car? Alone? What did you intend to do if someone else kidnapped them out of your car? You do realize if you say \"The door was locked,\" that means you kept children in a locked car. If you say, \"The door was unlocked,\" that means you were a hypocrite.", "Haha i would love to hear you tell a judge or jury that lol.", "My mum used to leave my brother and I at home while she and my dad went across the road to the neighbours.

Maybe the mom deserves it for not being able to understand the potential danger she put her children in. Is that what you want? \nAnd yes, we\u2019re judging the moms actions too. OP did not act in a vacuum, she responded to a situation created by the mom. By saying OP is not TA we\u2019re saying her action was less worse than the mom (and yes, I know it\u2019s not grammatical but I don\u2019t think better fits here). And in reverse, if we say that OP is TA, then we\u2019re saying that her action was worse than mom\u2019s.\n\nIn reality, I think that\u2019s the best example of ESH.", "No the kids were right behind me they are at the age where they can get out of their seats on their own.

You are focusing on specific examples when the main point is that leaving a 5 and 8 yr old alone is dangerous.", "The verdict isn't the only point I'm making here. We have differing opinions on if what the mom is doing is endangerment. In my state, it isn't.", "Normally I would agree with you on ESH, but op's actions could very well have handed the dad all the ammo he needed for the custody hearing, assuming his lawyers know about the incident. Imo, that makes her a bigger ah. She was so concerned about helping friend not giving the ex the edge he needed, and instead gave it him on a platter.", "Why is that not the same thing? If they can get out of their seat, what if they saw a friend from school across the street and (god forbid) decided to run out of the car into oncoming traffic?", "We can agree to disagree. I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s the best decision. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth subjecting kids to the mercy of cps either.", "And it is not the point I disagreed with, which is what the quote is for. \n\nLegaly, maybe. We don't know where she is. Common-sense wise, leaving a 5 nad 8 year old alone, with the doors unlocked is endangerment. All that needs to happen is an accident along the way and boom, she's gone an hour instead of 10 minutes. It's stupid behaviour. \n\nI've worked with kids in that age group for years. They can get themselves injured in less than 5 minutes without even trying - they just decide they want something from the top shelf or to run with scissors/pencils.", "Cps is going to place those kids with their dad.

It's not your place to teach your friend a lesson about parenting by using abusive parenting techniques on her. Wtf. You literally did kidnap her children, nothing fake about this.\n\n\nAnd maybe this is a cultural difference but children aged 8 and 5 should be old enough to be left alone for 5-10 minutes. She didn't leave them alone for an hour or more. Where I come from children that age go to school on their own. They walk there, take their bike or ride the bus on their own or in groups, they visit the playground on their own or walk to the corner shop to spend their allowance. Imagine being eight years old and not able to stay alone at home while your parent picks up a carton of milk.\n\nAbout the locked doors: debatable. Depends on the neighborhood. If a fire did break out as you fear, the kids would have a bigger chance to get themselves to safety if the doors are unlocked.

Kids that age blame themselves for everything because they are developmentally egocentric. How did you explain this to them? That their mum is a bad parent? Did you even bother to talk to them about why mum was so upset after? Ergh. Your lack of empathy is astounding. Next time offer to look after the kids while mum has to run the errand.", "Idk anything about kids so I'm not going to comment on if mom was in the wrong.

Her resources sound very limited at the moment and you should have offered to help because after this stunt you pulled her resources aren't going to grow.

Your friend of 20 years was struggling and needed assistance so you do this? You don't offer to help? You don't notify the father? And you SMILED when you saw her having a breakdown???

But it all goes to his head and he breaks into a couples house to \"teach them a lesson\" about leaving the window open. Eventually word gets around that a maniac is running wild.

Virtually no home has a working home phone now. And I'd be very surprised if one or both of the kids has access to a working cell phone. It's possible, I know people are giving them to their kids younger and younger - and given that they're going through a divorce it's possible the kids have one so the parents can call them directly when they're not visiting with them, but there is also a likelihood that an 8 and 5 year old do not have a working cell phone, or don't know how to use it to make outgoing calls. They may be able to answer an incoming call, and I'm sure they can navigate the apps just like a tablet, but I don't know many kids that age that can successfully make an outgoing call on a cell phone. Especially if they were panicked/terrified in an emergency. That's incredibly dangerous when you add that to the circumstances the mother is leaving them in. And precisely why they're too young to be left home alone. \n\nAs a mom and former nanny, I'm angry that mom thinks this is OK, on any level. But I also think everything the friend did is wrong.

How are people okay with this?? She leaves her **eight and five year old children ALONE.** Yeah her friend is an AH for scaring her but extreme times and all that... She's lucky it was just her friend that took them, instead of a real danger, fire, accident or the very real possibility that the Dad comes by, takes them and she has no argument against that. But no, people are more worried about if they were in car seats to move a few metres down the road. ESH but at least one of you is looking out for those kids.", "I had to read this sentence a couple times to figure out what you were saying.  I presume you mean his friend's vagina (OP's friend) e.g. the mum of the children. \n\nBut the way you wrote that in reply to a comment about two children and you were saying there (meaning \"their\" read as OP wants to touch the children's friend's vagina and was confusing and gross to read).", "How do we tell the OP is a male?", "OP is more concerned with being right than the kids being safe, don't get me wrong the mother is also very much at fault as well but OP has a lot to answer for.", "I upvoted your comment as it's a good point, but I'd hate to assume, neither OP or the mother seen that bothered by the kids safety x", "Is that hotline also good for lost children? If for any reason the children go out of that unlocked house, the cops will be called anyway.", "It\u2019s definitely illegal in my country. If the police arrived at your home and found your kids that age at home without supervision, they\u2019d certainly get CPS involved.", "Even if she locks the door, the kids can unlock it and leave. Someone can break in. There could be a fire. The kids could play with the stove or knives. They could fight and hurt each other. She herself could get in a car crash and not make it back home. As a parent, I could probably just keep going with this list forever of all the reasons you don't just leave kids alone.", "An 8 and 5 year old are not capable of staying home alone. Locked door or not. Dad needs to know about this. I'd be fucking furious. ESH", "The problem is they shouldn\u2019t leave the kids alone, unlocked door or not", "The problem is that kids those ages should never be left home alone, even with the doors locked. An 8 year old can open the locks to let in a stranger ( though statistically it's more likely to be someone you know which I feel makes it even worse). \n\nESH. If OP is (rightfully) concerned about the kids wellbeing, they should be calling the non-emergency line. I know from experience that this is not something that will get kids taken away (though it might cause her to get less custody if dad gets a hold of police report) but if mom is neglecting the kids like that, that often, they need to be with the more responsible parent.", "The kids could just unlock the door. 8 and 5 aren\u2019t capable of rational decision making in a crisis/emergency. They shouldn\u2019t be home alone unsupervised", "If she\u2019s leaving a 5 and 8 year old home alone with the doors unlocked, maybe there\u2019s more to the custody battle than op has said, which is just that there is one. \nOP, you should have just stayed with the kids in the house.", "Todays world is objectively a lot safer than 20-30 years ago.", "So you think it's fine to leave two children 8 and under alone at home?", "This! Obviously leaving an 8 YO to watch a 5 YO isn't ideal and packing up 2 kids to do a quick errand gets exhausting. I'm under the mind that mom still should take her kids with her or figure out a system so she's not needing to leave constantly for small things. That said, it sounds like this woman is going through a lot and she's still figuring things out. OP, instead of lecturing her or kidnapping her children, could have offered to simply watch them next time. A simple \"next time you find yourself needing to leave for a quick errand and don't want to take the kids, let me know and I'll watch them for a bit.\" Mom needs help right now", "You know I didn't even think about that, you're right! And is it really that hard to take the kids with her? She's really risking her kids lives for 5 minutes of peace? Insane.", ">She leaves her eight and five year old children ALONE.\n\n\nIs this an American thing? I don't get what the problem is. I mean, most 8-year-olds are alone every day after school, and as kong as they have a phone, there's no problem. And I think that an 8-year-old is perfectly capable of babysitting a 5-year-old for a few minutes.", "My thoughts exactly! OP was a justified asshole for taking the kids without the mother's permission, but it had to be done. Now the mother knows the panic she'll have if she comes home and her children are actually gone. And she said she doesn't even lock the door?? That's just insane to me god.", "I mean the only thing I agree with you is about the Dad comes by and takes them but else? We're talking up to an hour of alone time, right? Op even spoke of 5-10 MINUTES of alone time and you're claiming that's too much for an eight and five YEAR (not months) old? Wtf. It's not only extremely unhealthy for kids to be nonstop supervised (yes children need playtime without adult present, it's for their brain development important) I'm sorry but a five and year old absolutely can AND SHOULD be unsupervise sometimes. Additionally they're even at home and not outside alone. Jeez YTA op", "My kids are 12 & 9, and until today, was never left alone at home", "FFS, they're 5 and 8 years old being left in their own house for 5-10 minutes. They're completely capable of being left alone in that environment for that length of time.\n\nAlso, the likelihood of anyone kidnapping them is practically zero.  If Dad is scoping out the house to kidnap them he could just as easily do it at night while shes asleep or in the shower. Should she accompany them on every walk to the bus for school, too?", "I fixed it", "I never specified gender. They can be a lesbian for all I know, but, to me it sounds like OP has an unhealthy fetush towards this mother, maybe just narcissistic in nature but it gives me \"I love you like my personal play thing\" vibes.", "I couldn't agree more. \n\n\nIt doesn't make sense to put kids in an unsafe situation just because they were in an unsafe situation. \n\n\nThere are so many ways to help her friend that didn't require using the children as pawns.", "That's true.", "Not all kids are stupid though. My sons 5 and 6 use the microwave just fine. They know metals don\u2019t go in there.

If she's done this before they split he knows. Would be very simple to hire a PI, catch this on video, and bring it up in court. OP's stunt might be on video. Even without a PI, if any of  the neighbors have a Ring doorbell there could be video.  This was hella stupid on so many levels and ESH.", "They are. Not advisable, but a vast majority of them are capable, and a few do get left alone", "That\u2019s literally what I just said", "This. I don\u2019t leave my 8 and 11 year old alone in the house. Once the oldest 14, then maybe.", "I wish more people internalized this fact. Too many people focus on very unlikely (but very scary sounding) risks to children like kidnappings while ignoring the highly likely (but very mundane sounding) risks to children like car accidents.", "It\u2019s safer now because there weren\u2019t laws against leaving a 5-year old home alone with an 8-year old and no supervision. To create those laws meant someone got hurt\u2026Plus, an 8yo with access to the Internet and no supervision\u2026any predator could take advantage and just waltz into this house and snatch these kids up. ESH but most especially this absent mom.", "No it\u2019s not ? Technology has made it way worse. If the husband comes and kidnaps them he can literally go offline and god knows where he could go if he\u2019s not a no fly list he can get out quickly. Also if they get kidnapped by traffickers they can get smuggled via private jet out of the country. It is way less safe with how advanced technology is", "You can't leave a five year old and an eight year old alone. period. I was a single mom with twin preemies, and took them on every errand, had to hook them up to heart and lung moniters, in and out of double stroller for a five minute errand to Walgreens etc,, You don't leave kids alone for your convenience. OP shouldn't have taken them, but  I understand her frustration. What if something did happen, what would the mother say,,,I was only gone 5 minutes,,,how was I to know little one would turn on the oven? WTF NTA", "I agree, except the part where she leaves the door unlocked. That's just insane and asking for trouble. I don't even leave my dogs at home with the door unlocked.", "Can is ask why? I mean, much younger children are perfectly capable of playing outside, going to the store and walking to school, so I don't understand why such old children can't be left alone at home? Are you afraid that they will break something?", "Much better \ud83d\ude0a", "You are right re: gender.\n\n\nHowever I didn't get any sexual vibe going on. Lol", "The 5/8 year old can call 911 and say \"Mummy didn't come home\".\n\nThese aren't infants, they aren't even toddlers.", "You do realise that some kids just do not listen? Just because it was fine for us to be left alone when we were kids, doesn't mean we should leave our kids alone, especially with an unlocked door that's easy access. It takes, as OP showed, seconds for someone to get in and out with those kids. Imagine if it had been her ex that showed up, she would have immediately had those kids taken because courts deem it unsafe.", "Because electrical fires happen. Falling down happens. Choking happens. Break-ins happen. The mom could get in an accident and then the children would be left alone a lot longer. CPS taking the kids may be \"cruel\" to the kids but it's better than death because of mom's negligence", "That\u2019s wild. I can\u2019t even imagine that police would do absolutely nothing if they came to find little kids at home alone. Be interesting for an officer to weigh in here. Edited to add that where I live, children can\u2019t be unsupervised if they\u2019re under the age of 12. That even includes walking to school unsupervised for example.", "The comment you responded to said the unlocked door wasn\u2019t the problem. You responded \u201cUh yeah it is\u201d so I think you wrongly interpreted their question. What their comment was implying was that it was leaving the kids alone, not just the unlocked door.", "It literally is safer. Like data proves my point. Just the fact that we can think of more ways to harm each other does not mean that actual crime has gone up. There is so much data that the world is gradually becoming safer, it\u2019s just that since we have the internet and more connections, more of the reported crime reaches us, making us think it is less safe. There are overall less murders & less violent crimes. Less lethal traffic accidents etc.", "So exactly like 20-30 years ago.", "Ah yes, you're right. She should lock the door.", "Maybe I have poor English. But it's ownership or obsession I think might be well.", "Maddie McCann was my first thought as well, that and the stories of kids dying from the pull cord on blinds (not that it really affects kids over 5) but just the idea that it can take seconds for a potentially dangerous situation to occur with children.", "Being within earshot is not the same thing as not being within earshot.\n\nA lot of parenting self care is done while able to hear what is going on in the house.", "In all of those scenarios mom would know what happened and can respond immediately. Not remotely the same thing", "... have you never known a 5 or 8 year old to do a stupid, dangerous thing because they didn't know the consequences?\n\nWhen my BIL was 5, he tied a cape around his neck and tried jumping off the garden wall to see if he'd fly. The cape got caught around his neck on a nail in the wall and my MIL who was in the garden but had glanced away for a second  thankfully managed to grab him off the wall before he completed his unintentional hanging. If she'd been out on an errand, he'd have died.", "If she is in a car crash and not responsive at the scene, the first responders aren't going to look for her address and send somewhere there just in case she decided to leave a 5 and 8 year old at home.\n\nWhat if she doesn't wake up for hours or worse, at all? Sure eventually friends and family will be told and then someone will go to the house for the kids, but by that point they could have been alone for hours.", "I do agree that leaving them with the door unlocked is insane but giving the kids something to play with and a way to reach her if something happens still makes them more safe. Of course accidents can happen but if it\u2019s really 5-10 minutes that\u2019s a short time and hopefully she has gauged what her kids are like and wouldn\u2019t leave them alone if they couldn\u2019t behave on their own.", "Here is another source but most states don\u2019t have a minimum age . https://www.imom.com/home-alone-rules-state/", "I want to know what would happen if the cops or cps were called also. I don\u2019t think they should be. Because I don\u2019t think a child being left home alone for under 30 is a big deal.

I thought I had made it a point in my original statement but nonetheless I accept that I  have misread it.", "True. Didn\u2019t mean to sound aggressive I\u2019m just saying criminals have access to the same tech we do and use it to their advantage.

They think it\u2019s their job to teach people lessons and put them in their place and make them do what they feel is correct. Yes they\u2019re more likely to do extreme things like this with people they\u2019re closer with. But a friend of 20 years is plenty close for that. Definitely wouldn\u2019t need to be anything romantic/sexual. And nothing the OP said implies that it is. Just that OP is controlling and doesn\u2019t understand boundaries or consider the impact of their actions. Doesn\u2019t even seem like the OP feels bad for freaking her friend out, tbh.", "Literally anything; a fall down the stairs, someone hits their head, a squabble gone wrong, kid gets into the wrong drawer\u2026 my brother once dropped and caught a pair of scissors and cut his hand open. He was supervised; it took moments. He was fine, but if he\u2019d been alone, it could have been a different story.", "Bro mo is seriously wrong for leaving them alone with an unlocked front door where anyone can walk in. There is no justification for endangerment.", "Sure there are different dangers but it\u2019s just wrong to think that 20-30 years ago the world was safer. It was just smaller."]}
