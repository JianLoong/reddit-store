He show symptoms of ADD and is pretty forgetful. He loses a LOT of things. We're not wealthy but I still buy quality things for him and he's lost many Hydroflask bottles, winter gloves, and many other things through the years. \n\nLast year, I gave him my Garmin 245 Forerunner Music watch even though I still like it but it didn't go with a lot of feminine clothes I wear (it looked sporty). Last night I noticed he wasn't wearing it anymore and I realize he hasn't been wearing it in a while and so I have no idea when he has lost it and he can't remember either. He said last time he remembers it was in a box in his room, but the box is gone. So, I told him he has lost all video game privileges until he finds it. He got very upset because he has no idea where it is and he said it would keep popping off so it might have come off of his wrist and he think at some point got lost that way and he doesn't see why it's his fault that it's lost. \n\nAt this point I'm fed up with him losing things that I bought. He was very upset and crying because he loves to play video games and he thinks that I was being unfair. \n\nI told him another option he can do is to come up with $150 to pay me back (bought the watch originally for $350) for the watch. He can do chores to earn the money (his weekly allowances go straight to his savings account) and he has options to earn money from chores, reading books I recommend, anything that helps develop his skills, like writing, etc.\n\nHe thinks that I am unfair because the watch was old, it was already given to him so it was his at that point not mine, and he didn't lose it on purpose (and argued most kids lose many things). I just feel he needs to be more responsible and be more careful of his properties. I told him that since I bought that watch, it still has value to me (ie I worked for the money I paid it) even though I gave it to him. AITA?\n\n/additional info: Since it is often asked if my son is tested for ADD, his father and grandparents advised against getting a formal diagnosis because they are worried it might actually be more detrimental for him and that he might use it as an excuse for his actions. So we decided that we will assume he has mild ADD. Based from the comments here, I will go ahead and get a formal screening for my son.", "created_utc": 1676736400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115imec/aita_for_making_my_son_pay_for_the_watch_i_gave/", "score": 201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He doesn't owe you anything.

Kids do lose stuff. I may get people thinking I am being hard on you, but why don\u2019t you see if he really has ADD and get him some help? I don\u2019t think he is purposefully losing things just because he is being a jerk. Sorry YTA  Edit. Someone responded to my question.  You do realize ADD is an actual condition? I mean he can be treated and be more productive in school and while he may still lose stuff,as all kids, all people do, he may be able to be happier and healthier!  Don\u2019t ask relatives. Take him and have him evaluated!", "YTA.  First of a it was a gift. He can do with it as he please. Secondly, making someone with SDHD go through life without medication is like making them go through life with both arms tied behind their back. A person with ADHD cannot use willpower to overcome their shortcomings.  Your son\u2019s brain works differently from yours. \n\nPlease go over to r/ADHD to learn something. ADD is no longer used as a diagnosis. You\u2019d know this if you\u2019d seen a doctor. \n\nGet the book Delivered From Distraction.  This will help you understand why you need to get your son evaluated do that he receives medical care.", "YTA - You gave him a gift. Is it annoying that he lost it? Yes. Is it fair to make him pay you back for a thing you gave him as a gift? No, not at all. You're absolutely being unfair to him, and you're punishing him for doing exactly what 12 year olds do *when you knew in advance it was likely to happen.* \n\nLearning responsibility is important, but what you're actually teaching him is that gifts from you aren't actually gifts, they're a burden, and he'll be punished arbitrarily for losing or damaging them, even though they're supposed to be his. The punishment for losing an expensive watch should be that he doesn't have an expensive watch again until he buys one himself. But also, this should be a learning opportunity *for you*. Don't give super expensive fitness watches to children. It's a bad gift, because children lose things. \n\nIf the watch still had value to you *you shouldn't have given it to a 12 year old with a habit of losing things.*", "YTA on multiple levels. 1) it's a gift, so it's his, not yours. It's not reasonable to essentially demand that he pays for something he owns. 2) you set him up for failure. You admit that he loses things regularly. Why give him something of value if you know it's likely he'll lose it? 3) if you suspect your kid has add why in the world aren't you getting him tested? You are punishing him for something he can't help, either because he is possibly neurodivergent or just not yet mature enough to be responsible for it.", "YTA. Don\u2019t give your 12yo expensive stuff if they have a history of misplacing things.", "YTA. As he pointed out, you gave the watch to your son as a gift. What happens to it afterwards is really up to him. If you choose not to replace it, or to stop giving him more \"quality\" things, that's up to you. You're trying to control him and are using this experience to emphasize that control...  \"reading books I recommend, anything that helps develop his skills,\" etc. You even send his \"weekly allowance... straight to his savings account.\" What, other than the video games, does he get any control over his own life? When we remove choice, we remove the opportunity to develop better judgement.", "So you're just assuming your kid has 'mild ADD' - why don't you actually go to a doctor and get a diagnosis, get some understanding of the diagnosis and then decide what can be done to help your child. If you don't want drug treatments, there are absolutely ways to help without using medication. One of my family members had executive dysfunction and was cited to have ADHD, he wasn't put on medications and was rather helped through more classes and tactics. The thing is, executive dysfunction can develop later - and that's exactly what happened for them. It just took many years. I think your child should know that losing things matters - it's not about it being a gift, it's about having value for the things you're given. They should feel sorry about losing it. However, your child may struggle more with keeping track of things depending on how their brain is developing, and this is to no fault of their own conscious actions. Punishing them for this is not where you should do; you need a doctor to give him a formal assessment.", "Yeah, OP, YTA, for multiple reasons. If you \u2018gave\u2019, your son the watch, it\u2019s his. If it\u2019s his, he can eat it for all you\u2019re concerned. He doesn\u2019t owe anything. Instead, you\u2019ve created your own little subprime mortgage lending crisis and left your son holding the bag. As for your \u2018allowance\u2019 option, that is completely bonkers. Just to get this straight, he\u2019s doing chores for money that he doesn\u2019t even see. That is NOT the point of an allowance at all. That\u2019s supposed to be pretty cash, not mandatory savings.", "yta. for several reasons\n\n1. your son has ADD/ADHD so having that condition myself i know its easy to lose things and so do you.\n2. your son is 12. he's at the age where he's going to lose things regardless of if he has a disability or not.\n3. how do you expect your son to pay for something without a job?\n\nthink about these things before you act on them.", "You gave him a thing, so that thing was his.\nHe lost the thing.\nYou want him to pay YOU back?  He lost his own thing.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Losing the thing is already the punishment. It makes no sense for him to pay you for something you gave to him. Quit buying him shit. And, if you think he has ADD, then fucking take him to a doctor.", "I have ADHD, was diagnosed in my early 30s and it took 10 years of meds plus counseling where I tried hundreds of techniques to combat forgetfulness before I found the right combo that worked for me. Until then, I lost track of more items than I can even remember. I am still finding items I bought, lost, then forgot I even bought and lost them.  And I'm an adult.\n\nI get your frustration, but you need to remember he's a kid.  Just like you acknowledged in the beginning of your post, forgetfulness is part of ADHD. You really should not be spending money on quality items he takes out of the house, he's guaranteed to lose some of them. You should not have given him the watch yet, if it was still valuable to you; he kinda got set up for failure there.  And taking away his games will not teach him any lessons, he doesn't take them out of the house; he also cannot work or would even be able to, to pay you back that kind of money.  These are punishments just for the sake of punishment. \n\nIt's cruel to punish someone for things he really can't control, from a disorder he didn't ask to have; you wouldn't punish him if he was autistic, would you?  It feels like maybe you're more mad at yourself and are taking it out on him.  \n\nSorry but YTA.", "YTA  \n1) You gave him a gift. He doesn't owe you anything for that  \n2) You keep giving him things he will clearly lose. Why?  \n3) You think he has symptoms of ADD but seem to be doing nothing to address that  \n4) Don't give things way as gifts if you're not prepared for the consequences of what someone else may do to them", "YTA. People with ADHD don\u2019t lose things on purpose. They\u2019re not neglectful. They\u2019re not being careless. This is like blaming a person in a wheelchair for getting hurt after you forced them to take the stairs. You should rethink your parenting.", "YTA.\n\nFor starters, you gave him a gift. It's no longer yours. Any consequences you inflict on him should be reasonable and proportionate. Not getting buying him a replacement is reasonable. You expecting him to reimburse you for the cost is not.\n\nMore importantly, you think he has ADD, but won't get him evaluated, and yet you haven't taken time to learn enough about ADD or ADHD to understand his behavior or help him. That makes you an immensely big AH. He needs help, and you're specifically preventing him from getting any.\n\nBare minimum, you need to know that having ADD or ADHD makes many children operate developmentally at a level similar to children two years younger. Unless and until you get your son evaluated, you should assume his decision-making skills and responsibility level are roughly that of a ten year-old.", "YTA.  As a mom who has a ADHD child, he doesn't lose things often but when he does, I just want to smack my head.  He can't find his water that is literally right next to him.  He can't find his shoes that are by the back door.  Like there are only so many places his shoes can be, the front door or the back door.  They knew my son had issues at age 2 and diagnosed at age 5, I think. Why aren't you on the ball with getting him the help he needs if you suspect he has ADD?  YTA and a crap parent.  The attention issues cause a lot of brain farts.  While a normal person might put the milk on the fridge and the cereal in the fridge from time to time, people with attention disorders are constantly doing these silly mistakes.  Add to that crap parents and school wanting performance, it's hard for these children.", "YTA. So your son has apparent ADD, which is undiagnosed but due to this cannot keep track of things but you still continue to gift him quality things and then you expect him to pay for your poor decision when he eventually lost something. \n\nGet him diagnosed, and start attempting to combat his forgetfulness with different techniques. If he does have ADD, he needs help not punishment.", "YTA - Instead of helping him for his potential neurodovergency, you punish him. People like you are the reason so many of us have difficulties with trusting others and self love. You are punishing your son for something he can't control, telling him that you would rather see him receive negative consequences than understanding from his family.\n\nAlso, it was a gift. His now, end of story. You have no right, no say.\n\nYou are a major asshole.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t want your kid to lose things, and you know has trouble keeping track of things, it is your problem when they lose things. You aren\u2019t teaching  responsibility by making your son pay for a hand-me-down they didn\u2019t want, you are teaching your son to resent you. If you know the kid is going to lose stuff, don\u2019t get increasingly valuable stuff.", "YTA. \n\nYou said he has add, loses things and is a kid. Yet you gave him something expensive and expected, what? Him to all of a sudden Not be a kid with add? \n\nYTA because you literally set him up for failure. If it was on purpose because he was careless, that's different. But you are punishing him for things he's still learning to understand/control.", "YTA and i just wanna share my experience as someone who grew up with undiagnosed ADD because my parents thought i was too smart to actually have it and that it would just give me an excuse to not \u201clearn\u201d how to do things the \u201cnormal\u201d way. \n\nas a result, i spent my younger years feeling so ashamed of myself and guilty for not being able to do things that came easily for other kids. it also didn\u2019t help that rather than try to work with me to see what was the issue, my parents just assumed i was being lazy on purpose and wasn\u2019t trying when in reality, my brain was just literally wired differently and i needed more support than my parents could\u2019ve provided. \n\nfor example, i didn\u2019t keep losing my winter jackets because i wanted my parents to waste their money, it was because of a lack of object permanence that made me basically forget that jacket ever even existed. it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s now an excuse i fall back on when i lose things, but it does mean because i know what the problem is (lack of object permanence) rather than just assuming i\u2019m just lazy or not trying hard enough, i can actually find a solution that works rather that beating myself up over it. \n\nso in your case, your son has already shown that he struggles to not lose things and yet you still gave him an expensive watch? like it genuinely sounds like you just set a forgetful 12yo up for failure. \n\nbut this is all to say that the stigma around getting a diagnosis is very real, but you can very well be failing your children and preventing them from developing the tools they need to succeed in life if you let that stigma prevent him from getting the support he needs.", "YTA \n\nYou can't punish ADHD out of a child.   \n\nStop giving him expensive things.   They are going to get lost.  \n\nBelieve me, he feels awful.   \n\nGet him tested so you can go forward with accommodations at school if he has it.  \n\nADHD doesn't come from nowhere.  It's genetic.  Someone in the family has it as well.  \n\nTelling an ADHD kid to \"be more responsible\" is worthless without teaching him *HOW* to be more responsible.    Help him learn how to create habits that will help him in all aspects of his life.     Time management is crucial.   Even if he doesn't have ADHD, teach him those life skills everyone needs to know.   He's twelve, and he's right, kids lose things.   Kids break things.  Kids forget.   Don't expect him to act like an adult.\n\nIf he is diagnosed, educate yourself about it and *DON'T BLAME HIM*", "YTA\n\nYou can impose whatever punishment you want for losing the watch, but a gift is a gift. It can't have value to you once it is given away. That's not how gift giving works.\n\nAt best, you are treating this like you let him borrow it. If that was your intention, you failed at communicating it.\n\nThe best punishment for losing an item is to not replace it. If he wants another watch, he will have to buy it himself. Otherwise, if he can go without one, he probably didn't really need it to begin with.", "YTA He\u2019s right when he says you gave it to him and at that point it no longer has anything to do with you. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re fixated on this old watch that likely came off of his wrist out in the world somewhere - that\u2019s not carelessness on his part.\n\nDo you typically get off on punishing him for little to no reason? He\u2019s 12. Lay off the kid. Life\u2019s hard enough.", "YTA- you knew well before you gave him the watch that he had a habit of losing things and you gave it to him anyway. And might I add, you didn't even want it yourself anymore, so you are charging him why? I understand wanting him to be more responsible, but there are complicating factors and you are being a dick about this.", "YTA. When you give a gift, it's gone. Not yours anymore.\n\nGiving any 12 year old something that \"has value\" to you is risky. You set him up to disappoint you and now want to impose consequences.

If he wants a new watch, he can do chores, earn money and buy it for himself. That is a good way to help him develop responsibility. But you're not teaching him responsibility here.

It sounds like your entire strategy is just to think \u201cmaybe this thing is expensive so he will care more\u201d. He literally CANNOT care more or be more responsible without actual help. Even a neurotypical child would be a poor choice to give such expensive items to. Grow up and think proactively instead of reacting to losses.

He show symptoms of ADD and is pretty forgetful. He loses a LOT of things. We're not wealthy but I still buy quality things for him and he's lost many Hydroflask bottles, winter gloves, and many other things through the years. \n\nLast year, I gave him my Garmin 245 Forerunner Music watch even though I still like it but it didn't go with a lot of feminine clothes I wear (it looked sporty). Last night I noticed he wasn't wearing it anymore and I realize he hasn't been wearing it in a while and so I have no idea when he has lost it and he can't remember either. He said last time he remembers it was in a box in his room, but the box is gone. So, I told him he has lost all video game privileges until he finds it. He got very upset because he has no idea where it is and he said it would keep popping off so it might have come off of his wrist and he think at some point got lost that way and he doesn't see why it's his fault that it's lost. \n\nAt this point I'm fed up with him losing things that I bought. He was very upset and crying because he loves to play video games and he thinks that I was being unfair. \n\nI told him another option he can do is to come up with $150 to pay me back (bought the watch originally for $350) for the watch. He can do chores to earn the money (his weekly allowances go straight to his savings account) and he has options to earn money from chores, reading books I recommend, anything that helps develop his skills, like writing, etc.\n\nHe thinks that I am unfair because the watch was old, it was already given to him so it was his at that point not mine, and he didn't lose it on purpose (and argued most kids lose many things). I just feel he needs to be more responsible and be more careful of his properties. I told him that since I bought that watch, it still has value to me (ie I worked for the money I paid it) even though I gave it to him.

Get the little guy diagnosed and treated for his suspected ADHD - and stop giving him valuable things of yours until you do. It\u2019s asking for trouble that could easily be avoided. ADHD is a disability - holding onto objects, dates, times, places, and deadlines in your head can be like juggling 7 balls with those awful prism glasses on. It is NOT deliberate carelessness or something to be punished. You learn to work around it - my own home is covered in post-it notes of things I need to do throughout the day/week and I have 7-10 alarms & alerts on my phone per day to keep me on track - but you cannot punish ADHD out of someone any more than you could punish a redhead into magically growing blonde hair. It doesn\u2019t *work.*\n\nI know it is frustrating to feel like your child doesn\u2019t value the things that you do. You probably feel like he\u2019s just being careless and irresponsible. But you need to meet him at his level. He likely doesn\u2019t understand just how much of a luxury a smart watch is, especially if your family has a fair bit of tech in and around the home. That is his normal. We often take for granted the things we see and touch every day. They become routine, unimportant, they\u2019re always there. 12 year olds are still kids - they\u2019re still figuring things out. You can help him understand why what he\u2019s doing frustrates you without punishing him so harshly and fostering resentment right before those tumultuous teen years when you need his trust the most to keep him safe and help him grow into a decent young man. \n\nYou already know he values his games - so don\u2019t take them away, meet him there. Whether he has ADHD or not, you can still teach him age-appropriate levels of personal responsibility. His next video game? He can \u201cbuy\u201d it with chores - keep track and fill up a chart or some other kind of visual representation of his work so he can see his progress as the chart fills up - this is often very rewarding to ADHD brains. His next big tech purchase? Same thing. Try having him earn *his own* nice things, instead of giving him your cast-offs (indirectly demonstrating to him that they are of little to no value to you) and expecting him to still treat them like gold. You will teach him that his hard work is rewarded with nice things, and by earning what he has, he is more likely to understand its value and will be less likely to lose things.", "YTA. In your comments you say that you won\u2019t get him tested for ADHD because it will be detrimental to his future? That type of thinking is a HUGE problem. Why would you give your son an expensive watch if he loses things? Why would you punish him for something that you aren\u2019t even treating? I have ADHD, and if I had been diagnosed at a young age, my life would have been so much better. I was labeled as lazy, forgetful, air-headed and all kinds of things. All of those labels impacted my health far worse than an actual diagnosis and validation of my symptoms would have. \n\nI used to get punished for things like this, and guess what? I don\u2019t speak with my parents. Don\u2019t be surprised if your son eventually does the same since you aren\u2019t getting him the help he needs.

He lost it.  It's too late to come along randomly throw down a harsh punishment because you're upset.

It seems you didn't, so instead you look like a capricious asshole who's immaturely lashing out because your child has crossed some invisible boundary that they didn't know about because they're not a mind reader and you didn't tell them.  And no, \"quit losing your things\" when you're pissed off because he's lost something doesn't count.\n\nWhat you can do going forward is to quit buying him non-essentials (like another watch, or more video games/video game currency, new phone, etc.) and make him start buying those things himself.  Also give him clearly defined opportunities to earn money for himself.

Learn about the disorder and learn how you can help. People with ADHD/ADD struggle more internally than you do from the external symptoms. People with ADHD/ADD are prone to depression, anxiety and are generally very insecure. It's horrible to see people doing stuff that you're just incapable of doing as easily. We fall behind in schoolwork, we lose stuff, social skills are hard to learn, we are forgetful, our brains are constantly \"on\".

I\u2019ve had a few students where they started medication the year they were with me and it completely changed everything. The once forgetful, lost in their own thoughts student was suddenly able to focus on class, finish work, and their confidence sky rocketed.

Give him a cheap version of something that you won\u2019t be upset to get lost and if he can prove himself responsible for say, 6 months or one year, then give him a nicer one.", "Maybe start with a diagnosis, so you're not throwing one around online without knowing?", "Neurodivergent mom here with a Neurodivergent child (and spouse). Instead of punishment for losing things, I'd recommend utilizing tools to help you and your child. Come up with a plan that helps keep his things organized. Consistency is important. \n\nMy kid and I made a list of all daily living activities to go through routinely: Anywhere from getting dressed, prepping for school the next day, and, studying, and practicing instruments, etc. I keep the inside a plastic cover in order for my kid to check things off the list as they are completed. \n\nWe also try having bins for certain items by category. I know my kid won't stay super organized, but at least they will know what areas to look for items. \n\nSet alarms on electronic devices as reminders for any and all things. We have Alexa with an extra one in my kid's room, so if she's in there, she'll hear it as well. \n\nSee if his school has anything they can do to help, like a continued journal between the teacher and parents.\n\nYou may have to try a few things, and it may take time. Having a proper diagnosis will make a huge difference, too.", "\u201cHe keeps losing $50 water bottles! I don\u2019t know what his problem is!\u201d Well buying him $50 water bottles over and over is perhaps the beginning of the issue", "Give him a $5 kids watch and make him pay for *that* when he loses it.", "Stop buying him nice things. Make him earn them so he is more invested. Stop using arbitrary punishments just bc you want him to be as upset as you are.", "Talk to a professional developmental psychologist instead of randos on reddit.", "I think the thing to realize is that the ways you stay organized may not work for him.  Organizing was extremely stressful for me for a long time until I started finding systems that work for me.  \n\nI also have way fewer things to keep track of on a regular basis now that I\u2019m an adult.  I don\u2019t have a water bottle that travels with me.  I have one for home, one in my gym bag, one at my desk at work.  The things I keep with me are my wallet keys and phone.  I check for them when I get to and leave a place.   I got a chapstick holder and a airpods case that attached to my keys.  These are things they worked for me - maybe they aren\u2019t \u2018normal\u2019 organizational strategies but better to help your kid figure out what works than for him to constantly push the same strategy expecting different results.  As irritating as you find it I guarantee you that he\u2019s more frustrated with himself.  He has to live with his brain forever please help him.", "You could stop ignoring the fact that your son is struggling and get him the help that he needs. \n\nYou can stop punishing him for things he clearly can\u2019t help. \n\nYou can actually parent your child by taking him to the doctor to get a proper evaluation.", "Please tell me where you read that at ? So I can read the whole story for myself", "This boils my blood the absolute nerve of OP. They need to look up the effects from untreated ADHD. Just a sneakpeak can lead to sever depression and substance abuse. Your setting your kid up for life of failure if you don't start helping him OP", "Wow! Thank you!", "With this logic, you would choose not to have a dangerously thin child seen by a doctor because the child would see it as an opportunity to refuse eating to keep missing school for doctor's appointments. Duh! Get that child evaluated now!", "There are signs.  She suspects he has ADD.  This isn't me saying could he, she mentioned he might.  At age 12, she should be on the ball to see if he does or maybe it's his eyes or something else.  If she suspects, she should be taking steps because school and life for her kid is only going to get harder.  And yes if you lose say your car or car keys, you will have to pay for replacements.  But a watch?   Do you really need a watch these days or wouldn't a $10 watch be fine if he is known for losing things or have him buy a replacement if he wants a replacement?  It was HIS item that he misplace or possible lost.  For those who parents suspected and did nothing and the kids were punished or suffered, they get what I'm saying.  What I said might be harsh but if she suspects and she isn't doing anything to help figure out if there is something there and things that can be done to help him, she's an AH.", "Not only not getting him screened/diagnosed, but also apparently \"assuming he has mild ADD\" but doing zero reading or research on what that can look like, strategies to help keep organized, and common symptoms. Basic information ADHD is not terribly hard to find, assuming one has an internet connection!\n\nFor example, I am \"assuming\" my kid has ADHD, because genetics, but he is too young to screen and so I am reading up on how to support young children with ADHD and ready to spring into action as soon as he shows symptoms that impact his life. You can't just make the assumption and then...do nothing?", "Exactly this, substitute ADHD in this answer for literally any other medical condition and you see how wrong this sounds. Getting a diagnosis (not label) for your child opens up treatment and therapy options, allows you to research and learn coping strategies, and most importantly allows your child to understand who they are, instead of blaming themselves for any limitations their conditions causes. Also, I don't think I'd give any 12 year old child a \u00a3350 watch, let alone a child who already has difficulty losing stuff.", "I didn\u2019t find out I was autistic until I was 17 and I\u2019m still unlearning all of the extremely harmful beliefs that I developed due to lack of understanding and support. I didn\u2019t know WHY I was struggling and it led me to feeling completely broken and worthless; I was very depressed and struggled with suicidal ideation throughout middle and high school. \n\nDenying your children a formal diagnosis is denying them the ability to understand themselves and their role in society effectively. I knew I was different somehow. Undiagnosed kids KNOW they\u2019re different somehow\u2014but when they have no explanation, they either turn that pain inwards and blame themselves, or double down and find harmful external ways to cope. \n\nIt\u2019s especially dangerous for undiagnosed ADHD due to how ADHD affects impulsivity and neurochemical regulation. Many folks with ADHD are at risk for addiction due to the effects of ADHD on the \u201creward centers\u201d of the brain. (It\u2019s also why prescribed medications are a GOOD thing, because they\u2019re controlled and, when they work for the individual, bring neurochemical makeup up to more healthy/manageable levels. Unlike gambling, shopping, non prescribed drug, alcohol, and other addictions)", "My ex was diagnosed at 28 and told his mom. She said a doctor told her he had it when he was little and she disagreed so she never told him (or his father) about it. He had to spend his entire adolescence and young adulthood struggling so much more than would have been necessary, because of his mom. It really strained their relationship.

It\u2019s like, why?! If your kid was diabetic would you not give your kid insulin? That\u2019s a medication. Your kids brain needs something it\u2019s not getting on its own! Why are you denying your child something they need?! And I get it, drugs have side effects and not all meds work right at first, or you have to play with dosages. But if a med doesn\u2019t work for your kid, you can titrate them off. If it does work, you\u2019ve transformed their life for the better.", "Yes, this. Meds work so well for me that you will pry them out of my cold dead hands. I can\u2019t imagine how much harder life was anymore now that it doesn\u2019t have to be.", "Came to say this! Just like ADD is outdated, the idea that ADHD is a problem with paying attention is as well.  We now know it's a far more comprehensive disorder that affects executive functioning, social-emotional regulation and developmental levels.  I hate when people says things like, \"but they can't have ADHD, they can pay attention when they want to, like videogames.\"\n\n*headdesk* Yes, yes they can, hyperfocus is also a symptom.", "This was my first thought too. My adhd kid can\u2019t keep a pair of socks for more than like 2 weeks. He takes them off wherever/whenever and just \u201closes\u201d them. He only gets cheap Walmart socks now. He will never again get name brand until he can buy his own lol.", "Try a different doctor! There are still diagnostic questionnaires for adults.

Not only that, but don\u2019t get mad at the kid for losing something that doesn\u2019t mean much to him. If he really wanted the watch and was mad when he lost it, having him pay to replace it makes more sense. He apparently barely even noticed so it didn\u2019t mean much to him so why did they give it to him?", "His therapist might give him an excuse for his behaviors! /s", "LOL, I do this kind of but not with things I organize on purpose. It drives my husband up the wall. I'll just randomly put stuff where I don't normally put it because I got distracted and set it down for like half a second, and then it's like my brain just deletes it when I'm staring right at the object because that not it's normal place.", "What is up with people not being able to click on the OPs profile and scroll and click on individual comments lately?", "OP stated in a comment that the kids father and grandfather don\u2019t want him formally screened and she went along with it.", "People with adhd (diagnosed and undiagnosed) have a shorter average life expectancy too.", "I got diagnosed with ADHD in high school and autism in my early 20s.

I appreciate your advice so much \ud83d\udc9c", "I believe the disparity in life expectancy is more prevalent in people with untreated ADHD. At least that's what my doctor told me recently. That is one of the reasons why taking medications is important, because it can help mitigate the risk. I think it's something like 15 years shorter life expectancy with untreated ADHD.
