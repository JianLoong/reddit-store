It's been about a month and things have been really good so far; absolutely no issues. Last night we went to one of my friends Halloween parties and then went out to the bars after that. Both of us were pretty drunk, and we had a few friends that were extremely drunk and we decided to get an uber to get everyone home safe, taking them back to the house where the party was at. I ended up ordering the uber and the group kinda wandered away from where I ordered it from, I tried to change the pick up spot but I don't think that worked. The uber eventually arrived and we were about a block and a half away and the group wasn't really moving quickly, so after about 4-5 minutes of slow meandering I decided to run ahead to the car and talk to him and assure him everyone was on the way and would be there shortly. When I did this I didn't say anything to the group since I was somewhat ahead of them and the crossing light turned yellow so I ran to the other side; GF was not happy with this which is understandable, I should've told her what I was doing or just called the uber driver on my phone, or gotten another one. GF felt like I kind of abandoned her with a bunch of drunk people to take care of, we also did manage to get everyone into the uber okay.\n\nEventually we got to the party house safely and had to take care of all the drunk friends that were there; one of them starts crying about a guy she's talking to and just vanishes. We assume she ran outside somewhere, I run around the block looking for her but she ends up being in a closet. Eventually we get all the drunk friends either home or situated, and at this point its \\~4am and I'm extremely tired, so I just lay down on the stairs. GF wants to deep clean the party (my friends) house, so she mops the floor, starts scrubbing down counters, doing dishes, taking down decorations, etc. and asks me for help a few times. I'm very tired and really just want to go home and sleep, but I half heartedly do a few things for her like moving tables etc. but am not super happy since I just wanted to sleep. She asks me to find a magic eraser so she can scrub the walls, I find one under the sink and place it on the counter and then go lay on the floor. She gets upset at this because I'm laying on the recently mopped floor, and that I didn't wet the magic eraser - she called it \"weaponized incompetence\". To an extent it might've been, I really just wanted to sleep and not clean.

Wtf was your girlfriend on that she had that much energy to power clean someone elses house at that time in the morning after partying all night. She is the AH for getting mad and making comments like that when you were exhausted and wanted to go home and go to sleep.", "NTA, honestly I was on edge about this until you said 4am, not only that deep cleaning? Magic eraser on the wall??!! If you did not contribute to the mess you should not feel obligated to clean it at 4am and even if so, it should be a group effort the next day with all the friends", "NTA. Its perfectly reasonable to clean up the next day. Better yet, she should discuss it before hand.", "NTA. The first bit is a bit of a joke. You were trying to do a good thing. Your girlfriend is being petty. Why wasn\u2019t the owner of the house cleaning it up? When I get lit at someone\u2019s house I clean up all my bottles and other rubbish but you wouldn\u2019t see me deep cleaning a house unless they were paying me. If they didn\u2019t want their house to get trashed don\u2019t have drunk people round.", "NTA. You can clean after you get some sleep. Picking up a few things that are going to stain and cause damage? Sure! Deep cleaning?? Nah.", "NTA. There\u2019s a time & a place for that\u20264am drunk & tired at a friend\u2019s house ain\u2019t it. Wasn\u2019t your house or party and no host is expecting that of you. Either stay & sleep or go home & sleep THEN offer to come back & help clean up the next day if your friend wants you to.\n\nAs someone that struggled with this in my youth\u2026your g-friend might have some people pleasing issues.", "STA\n\nYou should have been honest with not wanting to clean up front and told her that you are going home and ask her to go with you.", "INFO: does she have to ask you to clean regularly? The phrase weaponized incompetence makes me think that this might be a larger issue. If you guys were not committed to cleaning up after the party, I don't understand why she felt like she had to deep clean somebody else's house.", "YTA. She was probably tired too.
