You are absolutely right that sex should not be a gift, should happen because you both want it, but if I go out shopping for lingerie I have my husband in mind when I pick it, what he's into, what colour he likes and so on and then squeeze myself in that thing...

It\u2019s a way to express her desire to please you and show you how much she loves you. What better gift than that? Reading your views on sex from what you\u2019ve written here I think you\u2019ve interpreted her gift the wrong way. She\u2019s not giving sex as the gift, and I doubt her intention is to do that. It\u2019s a common gift for partners to wear lingerie or spice things up for their partners especially on their birthday. \nI think the way you\u2019ve reacted to her can seriously affect her self esteem and lead to intimacy issues.

A) you two need to communicate better- she didn\u2019t get something that was more \u201cyou\u201d and you couldn\u2019t find a civil way to say \u201cthis isn\u2019t my thing\u201d. B) your gf was in a very vulnerable state when you lectured her- that\u2019s harsh and very likely will affect your sex life for a while. Work on that together to try to heal that wound. C) lingerie is impractical, uncomfortable, and can make people either feel great or really self conscious- understand that this wasn\u2019t a gift for her, it was a gift for you (just not a well thought out one). She may not have had a lot of time to prepare, or a lot of money to spend, or even perhaps is feeling like she wants to be closer to you and thought this was a great way to be romantic/intimate with you. \n\nEither way, y\u2019all need to communicate. And please be nice- for the rude reaction, I\u2019m voting soft YTA", "NAH, slight YTA. It just seems like you have two different ideas of what gifts can be. I would be more than happy if my boyfriend bought clothes i found sexy for my birthday, and i think this is a pretty common sentiment for a lot, if not most people. Are you sure your girlfriend feels sexually wanted and satisfied by you? She could be feeling disappointed or insecure, and trying to get your attention sexually. Kinda rude to share with others though, its a bit too intament for that.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t like the gift, she didn\u2019t know that. Most guys I\u2019ve dated saw special lingerie worn for them as the biggest gift too, and it\u2019s also suggested that way by media. So she isn\u2019t an asshole either. \n\nI do feel like your reaction is over the top though, like she was being malicious. Taking it that personal that she chose the wrong type of gift for you could relate more to own insecurities.", "YTA. The gift is obviously that your girlfriend wanted to excite you in a new way sexually. Ideally **both of you** would enjoy that. So yes it's a gift for both of you, but you're an AH for crushing your partner emotionally when they tried to do something nice for you.", "YTA. Your girlfriend attempted to show you affection and sounds like she was trying to do something sexy and flirty with/for you. Your response was out of proportion and inappropriate, based on the information you provided. \n\nIf I were your partner, I would feel very insecure about myself right now and possibly very mad at you.", "YTA lol \n\nMan I facepalmed reading this. Don\u2019t expect to get any sex from her in a while if you react like this. Embarrassing her and spilling the beans about her to internet strangers.", "NAH sounds like you guys have finally started communicating and are NOT on the same page. You could have been more sensitive in your delivery, right message, wrong way to convey it. For some of us putting on sweet undies and saying I'm all yours is the most totally vulnerable we can make ourselves, it might look like a power play, but it's totally putting yourself out there. Hmm the more I think about it the more I veer to YTA, kinda depends on the dynamics you have. \n\nDefinitely YTA for telling your mates.", "Someone please tell me what he means by saying we are Poly???", "NAH - I am perhaps reading into this too much, but is it possible that your partner is feeling like you find her attractive and/or that you're bored? This absolutely sounds like something I would have done in a past relationship if I felt my partner wasn't into me.   \n\n\nSex is a gift that is freely given and received by both partners. Your partner was trying to do something special to excite you. It didn't quite hit the mark.", "Ummmm lingerie is made to be looked at, not worn, so yes it was a gift for you. You were unnecessarily harsh about the whole thing when you could\u2019ve just communicated that you want gifts for outside the bedroom. There was no reason to insult her and call her selfish. YTA.", "I guess NAH so long as you accept that she should dump you and you should only be dating your own hand?", "YTA. You sound joyless, exhausting, and entirely unworthy of the effort of wearing uncomfortable clothing to attempt to please you. And no, you are not entitled to sex. Ever.", "YTA Do you have Mommie issues? That seems like a very odd reaction.  If she is a smart she will look for someone who appreciates her more than you do.  My husband buys his own birthday presents and is happy about it. Next time maybe you wont be so ignorant.  If you have mental  problems go see a Dr. Don't be taking your foolishness out on your girlfriend. I hope she leaves you. It's like throwing her away like a rag. You're mean.", "YTA....and  a pretty big one too.  I understand that you do not like lingerie but I guarantee your girlfriend took it as an insult to her personally and feels you may not find her attractive.  the lingerie is for you because she is trying to impress you.  Just because you do not like the gift does not mean you tell someone you do not appreciate it, way to hurt feelings.  I am also guessing you really do not care for sex", "Eh... Unless this is part of a pattern where she's buying things for herself and acting like they're for you, I'm going YTA, for a few reasons.\n\n1) She's making an effort, she's trying to impress you and be sexy for you, and you basically shot her down.\n\n2) You're relaying this story to others!? That's seriously not OK, you going to call your mom next? Nope. Personal stories like this shouldn't be shared unless your girlfriend says it's OK.\n\n3) It's not a red flag. Jesus.", "INFO - was that the only thing she bought you?\n\nI think you may be overthinking the whole \u201ctime to unwrap your present\u201d trope.  This could have been fun and lighthearted, and you turned it into a lecture on philosophy of sexual ethics, so\u2026 yeah, not great.\n\nBut if that was the sum total of their birthday gifts to you, it was more for her than for you.", "Eww. Creepy much? Yes. YTA", "YTA.\n\nThat is a very nice gesture and I think most people would appreciate it.\n\nThis seems to signal to me that you and your girlfriend are on completely different waves. I am sure she should and can find someone who will appreciate her more.", "How long have you been with your girlfriend? What would you have liked instead?", "YTA.\n\nSoon to be ex girlfriend btw.", "NAH\n\nSounds like a case of miscommunication. She may have been led to believe it might be something you'd enjoy. Certainly movies portray the wife/gf showing up in lingerie a \"gift\". She may have just wanted to feel sexy and wanted, which isn't really a gift for you, so a poor insight on her part. In any case, you both could learn a lesson about each other from this. I can understand both parties being kind of upset for legitimate reasons but it seems like a simple misunderstanding.", ">Final Edit: We are poly which I think influenced my reaction to this.\n\nNTA for not liking the gift; that's fine though I think you went about communicating your lack of appreciation poorly.\n\nAs a fellow polyam person, this does lead me to wonder a few things about your relationship that might have led to her making this choice. I could see this being a scenario where 1) maybe this was a gift that was deeply appreciated by another/previous partner and so she thought you would like the same, 2) 1 or both of you have been very sexually focused on other partners lately and this is her way of trying to reconnect, 3) you've been physically neglecting this relationship for a while and don't realize it, and she thinks she has to \"win\" you back with sex. There are about a dozen different possibilities behind her decision-making. But *you are never going to find out what it was* if, instead of expressing curiosity about her choice, you just tell her it was obviously selfish and a bad present and that's it.\n\nKeep in mind that it's common in movies for girlfriends showing up in lingerie to be considered a gift. I think if neither of you thought to talk about birthday expectations, what you like in a gift, what you want to do with your birthday, etc AND you're polyamorous you need to work on that ASAP. These communication issues are going to bite you in the ass hard with polyamory. Maybe she assumed you were doing other things with other girlfriends? How long have you been together? Maybe she has no idea what you expect from a gift because you've never celebrated a birthday together before? who knows. \n\nI have an in-law that is a very sweet person that loves their spouse, but is terrible at giving gifts. Has 0 intuition about what to get and literally needs to be given a list of what to do for holidays because otherwise they have no idea. Your GF not following your unsaid expectations isn't necessarily malicious. Some people just don't get gift-giving. Again, you gotta talk about it though.", "NTA about not liking the gift. Wanting your bday to be about you as a person.\n\nIf you only told this within your relationship I guess I\u2019d understand (if that\u2019s agreed amongst you). \n\nNo need to discuss outside that and/or your one best friend for advice etc. \n\nGF maybe had other reasons for going with this gift - did you ask about the rest of your birthday? Do you talk about what you want for your bday? Communicate before coming down on someone\u2019s so harshly.\n\nAlso I\u2019d have similar said \u2018I don\u2019t like sex being used as a gift, sorry. You do look nice - maybe we save that for another day.\u2019\n\nTalking respectfully is a basic minimum.", "Kinda sounds like there's 3 women in this relationship.  Bring on the downvotes.", "Yeah your response to this makes me think there\u2019s a LOT more going wrong with this relationship than just a thoughtless birthday gift. Which I agree, that\u2019s a terrible non-gift and to anyone reading this: unless your partner has expressed they\u2019d be specifically into receiving a \u201cgift\u201d like that, never do it. All the points op made are valid, although it does seem like a pretty extreme reaction to the situation. Which brings me back to thinking there\u2019s a hell of a lot more wrong with this relationship than 1 bad gift. If this was a healthy relationship to start I can\u2019t see someone blowing up over a shitty gift like this.\n\nSo if she\u2019s not the one op, just break up with her and find someone who you\u2019re more compatible with.", "Do you mean NAH - or do you think OP's girlfriend is the AH?", "Haha. An ex bf bought \u201cme\u201d a ps4 for Christmas one year. We played Overcooked together a few times, but otherwise, guess who was the one using it all the the time? Not me. He took it with him when he moved out because \u201che paid for it.\u201d\n\nNTA OP, mostly because you said your gf has a lingerie collection.

She did nothing for my birthday besides that", "You don\u2019t talk over your relationship issues with your closest friends?", "If all a guy got me for my birthday was sexy lingerie, I'd be filthy about it.

For your birthday, you\u2019re having sex but in different clothes. But you better be grateful!", "Well, OP didn't tell his lady that.. Perhaps she should've known he doesn't even like lingerie to begin with?? \n\nSeems like a thing a good partner would know.. Right?

I did read your updates just now and because I am curious.if you do not mind sharing why would or how would being poly influence your reaction?", "In that case, NTA.  If you had \u201ccelebrated\u201d her that way on her birthday, she would be all, \u201cWhat, no card?  No roses? No dinner?  No cake, no candles, no wine, no nothing?  Just a pair of underwear that\u2019s going in your underwear drawer?  You call that a birthday?!\u201d\n\nNow I want to know if your sex life is decent the rest of the year.  If it is, then she has done literally nothing for you that she couldn\u2019t have done by getting into one of the lingerie sets she already owns.  And if it isn\u2019t, well, Birthday sex only on your birthday is depressing.", "Ok, I see, totally see your point now especially since you voiced that lingerie is not something that even turns you on but maybe it makes her feel sexy and confident. I\u2019m going with NTA, she could have def gotten you a gift and she could still have done the lingerie as a birthday night surprise. I think you would have responded better.", "Just curious, what gifts have you gotten her? Being poly blurs things to a degree maybe she feels the need to be competitive sexually?", "While I agree with you, I have some shocking news about how frequently, (in extreme detail), women tell their friends about their respective sex lives.", "No way? If a dude bought a girl lingerie, she would tell her friends if she were insulted by it, maybe her mother if she were close to her and wanted advice. How is this different?", ">It telling bedroom secrets outside the bedroom.\n\nIt stopped being a \"bedroom secret\" when she turned it into a \"birthday gift\".", "Then you should use the phrase Y T A not N T A  \n\n\nedit to add: Your current rating implies that OP is not TA but his gf is.", "Or, and hear me out, get them in HER size, wear them anyway so that they get all stretched out (Assuming OP is not smaller that the gf), and then give them to her anyway\u2026! /s", "I would have appreciated the meal much more. She collects lingerie and has an entire dresser full of it. It just made me feel like she was adding to her collection.\n\nThe meal would have shown knowledge of me and more effort on her part in my eyes", "That\u2019s a fair point", "It\u2019s in the title my guy", "Oh ok thanks for explaining it to me.", "I agree that I could have responded better. The fact that it riled me up so much is something I need to to look inward about", "I am someone who is greatly moved by thoughtful gestures. I don\u2019t need fancy presents, it\u2019s the thought that makes me feel cared for. I can see your point and why you feel hurt. Edit: you\u2019re \ud83d\ude02", ">She collects lingerie and has an entire dresser full of it.\n\nLook, I'm voting you nta/nah because I agree that sex is a shitty gift. But think about who she wears all that lingerie for. Does she wear it for herself when you're not around? Or just for you? \n\nSociety and media have taught women that sex is given and being sexy can be a gift. I cant even remember the number or what movies have women in Santa lingerie dancing to Santa baby.", "I can't read :D 29 is old enough to know that discussing your relationship issues with a group of friends is sort of disrespectful to your partner. It's not like you shouldn't ever do it, but if you do it constantly, that's an issue in itself. You should discuss your issues with her first and foremost.", "I wasn\u2019t even thinking that but that is some really good self reflection.", "Yeah, but she should know her partner better.", "They mention that they are poly, so the \"gift\" they received was an addition to the collection and a decent chance that for others to see aswell as themselves, if the poly comment is anything to go by?", "That\u2019s a fair point. I likely should have waited to discuss it with my therapist rather than talking to my close friends.", "In any case, you're NTA in this situation. Her gift was lame and not really a gift for you. You had every right to be upset."]}
