You did NOT say that they were disrupting other students or that they were talking when they shouldn't have been.\n\nThat, my internet stranger, is racist.\n\nAlso, identifying them as ethnic people is irrelevant to the story. The fact is that they weren't speaking English. If they were two white girls speaking French, would you have judged it the same? If not, double YTA. If so, then the fact that you don't know their race is not crucial to the story.\n\nYou would not have been an AH if you simply asked them to remain on task and keep their voices down. You didn't.

(in NJ, anyway)\n\nOh and OP: YTA", "Can confirm her edit makes her even worse like trying harder to justify her actions instead of realizing she just a racist AH. Look I sent white kids to the office too\u2026", "Don't need to.  Didn't assume necessarily that she was white person and even not  OP should know better.  Ethnic people shouldn't use ethnic either to describe others. OP was still differentiating their ethnicity as other.  Maybe do some reading.", "I highly doubt a chemistry lab is one of those situations\u2026", "I mean you actually do need to be able to monitor what they are saying in class to be able to determine if they are staying on topic or not.\n\nAlso OP did ask for them to quiet down and stay on task three times.", "I was a teacher until 60. The reason I was able to grade their chemistry labs is because I am a fomer teacher.", "After class when I was grading, I saw that the girls finished their lab, albeit none of their data and analysis was accurate and they wrote one sentence explanations for questions that clearly required paragraph responses.\n\nThe boys only finished data collection but wrote no analysis. Because they were repeatedly off task I sent them to the dean earlier too.\n\nMind you, both groups were at the dean for 15 minutes, and classes are one hour. The lab took most groups 30 minutes. So both of these groups had plenty of time to finish their work yet did not.", "OP def the AH. But also that's what happens when you put someone on the edge of 70 in charge of modern kids with no  training required, haha.", "I feel bad for your former students. You have shown nothing that hints to you ever having been a teacher or a good one at that.", "Montessori doesn't count.", "So, *if* that was caused by them being off-task, then they'll get a lower grade as an appropriate consequence of their actions. No Dean required.\n\nBut that isn't the only thing causing the lower grade. If it weren't a timed assignment, then it doesn't matter if they did it more slowly than other students. They deserved the same allotted classtime to get it done and they had fifteen minutes less and their grade will be lower than it would've been because you were acting like a bigot. \n\nAnd what you say about the boys speaking English, it's clear that speaking the same language doesn't actually translate into you being able to keep kids on task. So, again, the language they were speaking should've had no bearing on anything.", "Lol, no. They didn\u2019t finish their work because you sent them to the Dean because they spoke a language you don\u2019t know. \n\nRegardless, it\u2019s their grade to get. You, as a sub, know absolutely nothing about their general work quality/work ethic. All you know is this one day where you taught them that adults in positions of power could very well discriminate against them when they act as themselves with their first language. You made their first language a criminal act.", "Did it ever occur to you that their one sentence answers may have been because they do have English as a second language?? Over half of my class this year is ESL, and of course they aren't giving answers that are as detailed or complete as my students who grew up speaking/reading/writing English. Yikes.", "Yes, because I have experience grading chemistry labs from teaching preschoolers. Jesus Christ.", ">They didn\u2019t finish their work because you sent them to the Dean\n\nI already explained that they had plenty of time to finish. They were gone for 15 minutes, class is an hour, and the lab took 30 minutes for most groups. So they had 45 minutes to complete it and did not.", "Do you think they are incompetent because they are bilingual? They spoke perfectly fluent English to me when I confronted them. Being bilingual does not mean you don't understand the meaning of the words \"write 5 sentences.\"", "You came here for a judgment, you have been judged an asshole because of your racism. It calls your competence into question.", "PRESCHOOLERS??? Lord jesus", "Did it ever occur to you that they might have needed more time to work on the assignment? Did it occur to you at all that they might struggle in this course and what they provided was the best of their ability? Of course not. \n\nYou\u2019re a sub. You don\u2019t know these kids. You also absolutely messed up.", "LOL. Yup, twist away. What I just said does not even begin to resemble what you are pretending I said. \n\nWhen I was a sub, if I had a pair of students who spoke another primary language as a first language, and didn't do as much for their answers as other students, I would check in to make sure they understood what they were supposed to be doing the assignment. And if they were struggling, I would kindly lay out the expectations and help them reach those expectations. Which it doesn't sound like you did AT ALL. In fact, all you've done is assume that they were lazy and didn't complete the assignment because they wasted time. When in fact you wasted their time by sending them to the office for an incredibly stupid reason.", "Do you understand that you asked if you are the bad one in this situation and you are fighting against the majority that tells you that indeed, you were the bad one?", "Wow what is wrong with you? Fewer sentences does not equal incompetent for ELL students. You can be fluent and still be an ELL Student as well. Furthermore, YOU ARE JUST A SUB.", "She was being sarcastic\u2026\u2026. Preschoolers aren\u2019t doing chemistry labs. She\u2019s still TA\u2026 but the sarcasm was obvious after the Montessori doesn\u2019t count comment.", "They have no IEP, so I do not see why they would need more time to work on the assignment. And if they are struggling in the class (which should not be the case since when I wrote their scores on the grade tracker I saw previous high scores,) I don't see why they were laughing throughout the whole lab instead of staying focused during the initial 30 minutes and the additional 15 minutes they got."]}
