My whole family is split on what I should do, but after a heated argument it was mutually agreed that I will not be attending the wedding. My brother and FSIL cannot seem to comprehend that this is not about the dress but how they treated me. For those wondering what our parents have to say, our mother says \"if you're gunna be an asshole don't be upset when someone's an asshole back\" my dad says \"...\" Because he's long dead. My brother & FSIL thinks I am the asshole but by the way my mom paid for the hotel for my trip, I think it is safe to assume whose side she's low key on. I appreciate all the love and support I got, I will have an amazing time in Maimi and won't feel the slightest bit guilty thanks to the overwhelmingly positive response I got on here. \n\nThanks you all!", "created_utc": 1688687570, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sq70q/update_wibta_if_i_go_on_vacation_instead_of_my/", "score": 5142, "replies": ["#Reminder: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means and save yourself from a temp ban.\r\n\r\n##Pro Tip: \"bridezilla\" is NOT civil.", "Excellent update.
