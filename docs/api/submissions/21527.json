WIBTA if I go on vacation instead of my brothers wedding?", "selftext": "Update! \n\nSo unfortunately since reddit is awful at keeping secrets, Becky saw the post on TikTok so she obviously let the cat out of the bag. My whole family is split on what I should do, but after a heated argument it was mutually agreed that I will not be attending the wedding. My brother and FSIL cannot seem to comprehend that this is not about the dress but how they treated me. For those wondering what our parents have to say, our mother says \"if you're gunna be an asshole don't be upset when someone's an asshole back\" my dad says \"...\" Because he's long dead. My brother & FSIL thinks I am the asshole but by the way my mom paid for the hotel for my trip, I think it is safe to assume whose side she's low key on. I appreciate all the love and support I got, I will have an amazing time in Maimi and won't feel the slightest bit guilty thanks to the overwhelmingly positive response I got on here. \n\nThanks you all!", "created_utc": 1688687570, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sq70q/update_wibta_if_i_go_on_vacation_instead_of_my/", "score": 307, "replies": ["#Reminder: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means and save yourself from a temp ban.\r\n\r\n##Pro Tip: \"bridezilla\" is NOT civil.", "Excellent update. Your bro and FSIL are some real un-self-aware, clueless AHs. Safe safe and have fun on your trip!", "Have a great trip! If they still don't get it, they never will.  So soak up that sun!", "No one gets to demand that you give over ANYTHING YOU PAID FOR. The dress started the issue and then FSIL still found ways to insult you because she wants that dress. Your money, your dress, your dignity and big bro can't even defend his sister. I also have a brother 10 years older than me and we were very close. He'd have defended me saying that my money paid for it. Your brother is spineless and just as selfish as FSIL.", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qk4c9/wibta_if_i_go_on_vacation_instead_of_my_brothers/)", "Well, you'll be able to have asshole-free vacations now! Have fun in Miami!!! \ud83c\udf89", "Honestly that's the best way they could've found out. Ie, well ahead of the wedding, so they have time to process it. Also, it's good they found the online discussion on their own, so they had a chance to see all the responses instead of you at some point being like \"well actually the _internet_ says you're TA\" which would obviously just sound 10000% self serving to ever bring up on your own. They might never agree that they're TA, but at least they'll know a lot of people genuinely thought they're TA, and that you thought it all through rationally and responsibly.", "Omg, your mom!  10/10 saying!", "If the dress mattered that much, Sarah should\u2019ve paid on Becky\u2019s behalf. Since Becky being a bridesmaid was so important to her.", "So glad you're going to Miami! Hope you have a great time", "Miami!!! Miami!!! Go have a blast! When you get married\u2026try doing the same to them. Oh wait\u2026last minute change. I really don\u2019t want you to be in the wedding after what you did to me. (Ok that would be wrong but it makes me smile.)", "Good for you enjoy !", "> my dad says \"...\" Because he's long dead. \n\nThank you, I got a good laugh out of that", "Were the names and ages not fake on the original post? If so, ouch.", "I hope you have the time of your life\u2026guilt-free.", "While you are on vacation go dress shopping and post a few photos on social media.", "This is why I am deeply resentful of tiktok accounts that scrape subreddits like this for content. Sorry this happened to you.", "The dad line was completely unexpected and just killed me, bravo.", "I didn't really understand this post off the cuff, but IMO weddings suck in general. If you enjoy weddings, more power to you, but don't engage in this shit where you make other people feel obligated to go to them.\n\n\"But what if it leads to a sidequest that yields a cool reward?\"\n\nThere's not going to be a sidequest that yields a cool reward.", "I've never been to Maimi but you should try visiting Miami while you are in the area.", "YTA you just outed your mom. Like come on son.", "have a blast!", "Glad to hear that you are going to Miami as I thought that you were NTA; however, I am not understanding something that you wrote, Your mother said, \"if you're gunna be an asshole don't be upset when someone's an asshole back\" and then you wrote  'my dad says \"...\" Because he's long dead.\" '\n\nNow, I have often said what your mother said, but I am not understanding what your dad meant. I will admit that I didn't get much sleep last night and it's been a long day so apologies if this was obvious and I missed it.", "Sounds like going to a Denny's and getting food poisoning would be more fun than that wedding.\nEnjoy Miami!", "Enjoy your vacation", "OMG I LOVE YOU, YOUR MOM, AND YOUR SHY FATHER. \ud83d\ude02\n\nTHE \"...\" had me wheezing.", "I sure do love a happy ending!", "Okay but seriously OP, what did your brother and FSIL say/react when they realized the internet was against them?! This chismosa is dying to know! If you'd be so kind, ofc.", "Lol have fun! & I hope your FSIL and brother see this update and know that they are TA\u2019s.", "Lol Becky probably whined that you returned the dress so you can go on the trip. Have fun and enjoy the drama free trip!", "Yes bestie!  You go to Miami and have the time if your life.  Your mom sounds amazing. Sadly your brother and SIL are shitty people.  Enjoy Miami!", "Isn't she great!?  I'd love an update about the wedding.  What did the new bridesmaid wear?  What did Mum say when asked where OP was?  I hope she directs the questions back to the bride and groom.  NTA", ">By then they will have a gremlin or two.  They will want them to be the flower girl and ringbearer.  Then it is time to have fun.  Talk about paying for a professional flower girl and ringbearer from a talent agency.", "I used fake names, but I guess me talking about an 800 dollar dress and getting booted from a wedding was oddly specific.", "Why would you think that? You don\u2019t need names to recognize your own deranged behavior and exorbitantly priced bridesmaid dress. But even if OP did use their real names, I don\u2019t see the harm. They clearly weren\u2019t ashamed of their actions when they were pushing OP around.", "If you read the original post, it makes a lot more sense. TLDR: OP was supposed to be a bridesmaid, but was replaced. The bride and groom still wanted her to pay for her dress so new bridesmaid wouldn't have to spend any money. OP refused and returned the dress. They offered to make her the \"Assistant to the Flower Girl\" instead. Her coworker had plans for Miami, so OP joining her coworker down in Miami instead of tge wedding now.", "What? How is that relevant to the post?", "As I understand it, her dad is dead and thus can\u2019t say anything.", "She said what her mom said then just in case she put what her dad would say because someone is going to ask so basically she said her dad is not saying anything because he is dead. (If he was talking he would be a zombie and this would be a very different post. )", "That\u2019ll do it! At least it doesn\u2019t seem to have caused that big of a problem for you. Good luck OP!", "Because rest of family knows to read reddit now,  it's a crummy thing to do to mom to say it here", "Thanks! I really did miss that.", "OOOOOHHHH! Thank you! Feeling clueless now. I think that it may be time for me to get some sleep.", "Don't worry it's time to use the sleep lol."]}
