WIBTA if I go on vacation instead of my brothers wedding?", "selftext": "Update! \n\nSo unfortunately since reddit is awful at keeping secrets, Becky saw the post on TikTok so she obviously let the cat out of the bag. My whole family is split on what I should do, but after a heated argument it was mutually agreed that I will not be attending the wedding. My brother and FSIL cannot seem to comprehend that this is not about the dress but how they treated me. For those wondering what our parents have to say, our mother says \"if you're gunna be an asshole don't be upset when someone's an asshole back\" my dad says \"...\" Because he's long dead. My brother & FSIL thinks I am the asshole but by the way my mom paid for the hotel for my trip, I think it is safe to assume whose side she's low key on. I appreciate all the love and support I got, I will have an amazing time in Maimi and won't feel the slightest bit guilty thanks to the overwhelmingly positive response I got on here. \n\nThanks you all!", "created_utc": 1688687570, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sq70q/update_wibta_if_i_go_on_vacation_instead_of_my/", "score": 1462, "replies": ["#Reminder: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means and save yourself from a temp ban.\r\n\r\n##Pro Tip: \"bridezilla\" is NOT civil.", "Excellent update. Your bro and FSIL are some real un-self-aware, clueless AHs. Safe safe and have fun on your trip!", "Have a great trip! If they still don't get it, they never will.  So soak up that sun!", "No one gets to demand that you give over ANYTHING YOU PAID FOR. The dress started the issue and then FSIL still found ways to insult you because she wants that dress. Your money, your dress, your dignity and big bro can't even defend his sister. I also have a brother 10 years older than me and we were very close. He'd have defended me saying that my money paid for it.

Have fun in Miami!!! \ud83c\udf89", "Honestly that's the best way they could've found out. Ie, well ahead of the wedding, so they have time to process it. Also, it's good they found the online discussion on their own, so they had a chance to see all the responses instead of you at some point being like \"well actually the _internet_ says you're TA\" which would obviously just sound 10000% self serving to ever bring up on your own. They might never agree that they're TA, but at least they'll know a lot of people genuinely thought they're TA, and that you thought it all through rationally and responsibly.", "Omg, your mom!  10/10 saying!", "If the dress mattered that much, Sarah should\u2019ve paid on Becky\u2019s behalf. Since Becky being a bridesmaid was so important to her.", "So glad you're going to Miami! Hope you have a great time", "Miami!!! Miami!!! Go have a blast! When you get married\u2026try doing the same to them. Oh wait\u2026last minute change. I really don\u2019t want you to be in the wedding after what you did to me.

If so, ouch.", "I hope you have the time of your life\u2026guilt-free.", "While you are on vacation go dress shopping and post a few photos on social media.", "This is why I am deeply resentful of tiktok accounts that scrape subreddits like this for content. Sorry this happened to you.", "The dad line was completely unexpected and just killed me, bravo.", "I didn't really understand this post off the cuff, but IMO weddings suck in general. If you enjoy weddings, more power to you, but don't engage in this shit where you make other people feel obligated to go to them.\n\n\"But what if it leads to a sidequest that yields a cool reward?\"\n\nThere's not going to be a sidequest that yields a cool reward.", "I've never been to Maimi but you should try visiting Miami while you are in the area.", "YTA you just outed your mom. Like come on son.", "have a blast!", "Glad to hear that you are going to Miami as I thought that you were NTA; however, I am not understanding something that you wrote, Your mother said, \"if you're gunna be an asshole don't be upset when someone's an asshole back\" and then you wrote  'my dad says \"...\" Because he's long dead.\" '\n\nNow, I have often said what your mother said, but I am not understanding what your dad meant. I will admit that I didn't get much sleep last night and it's been a long day so apologies if this was obvious and I missed it.", "Sounds like going to a Denny's and getting food poisoning would be more fun than that wedding.\nEnjoy Miami!", "Enjoy your vacation", "OMG I LOVE YOU, YOUR MOM, AND YOUR SHY FATHER. \ud83d\ude02\n\nTHE \"...\" had me wheezing.", "I sure do love a happy ending!", "Okay but seriously OP, what did your brother and FSIL say/react when they realized the internet was against them?! This chismosa is dying to know! If you'd be so kind, ofc.", "Lol have fun! & I hope your FSIL and brother see this update and know that they are TA\u2019s.", "Lol Becky probably whined that you returned the dress so you can go on the trip. Have fun and enjoy the drama free trip!", "Yes bestie!  You go to Miami and have the time of your life.  Your mom sounds amazing. Sadly your brother and SIL are shitty people.  Enjoy Miami!", "Isn't she great!?  I'd love an update about the wedding.  What did the new bridesmaid wear?  What did Mum say when asked where OP was?  I hope she directs the questions back to the bride and groom.  NTA", ">By then they will have a gremlin or two.  They will want them to be the flower girl and ringbearer.  Then it is time to have fun.  Talk about paying for a professional flower girl and ringbearer from a talent agency.", "I used fake names, but I guess me talking about an 800 dollar dress and getting booted from a wedding was oddly specific.", "Why would you think that? You don\u2019t need names to recognize your own deranged behavior and exorbitantly priced bridesmaid dress. But even if OP did use their real names, I don\u2019t see the harm. They clearly weren\u2019t ashamed of their actions when they were pushing OP around.", "If you read the original post, it makes a lot more sense. TLDR: OP was supposed to be a bridesmaid, but was replaced. The bride and groom still wanted her to pay for her dress so new bridesmaid wouldn't have to spend any money. OP refused and returned the dress. They offered to make her the \"Assistant to the Flower Girl\" instead. Her coworker had plans for Miami, so OP joining her coworker down in Miami instead of tge wedding now.", "What? How is that relevant to the post?", "As I understand it, her dad is dead and thus can\u2019t say anything.", "She said what her mom said then just in case she put what her dad would say because someone is going to ask so basically she said her dad is not saying anything because he is dead.

Good luck OP!", "Because rest of family knows to read reddit now,  it's a crummy thing to do to mom to say it here", "Thanks! I really did miss that.", "OOOOOHHHH! Thank you! Feeling clueless now. I think that it may be time for me to get some sleep.", "Don't worry it's time to use the sleep lol.", "Becky if you read this - 38,000 almost 39,000 people on the first post said that you are an asshole for what you did. If you can\u2019t understand why you need therapy to help you understand. \n\nIt is also really sad that you have effectively destroyed the relationship between your husband to be and his only sibling, Again if you can\u2019t understand this please find a qualified counsellor to help you.\n\nBrother - when Becky shows this to you follow your wife to be to counselling to develop some insight into the impact of your actions.", "Right on! I gotta say your brother is 10 years older, but he is way more immature one of you two, and so insensitive! And since you never had much of a relationship w/ him anyway, no big loss if this is the end of that relationship.  \n\n\nCurious, since you became close w/ the other bridesmaid, do they know about all this? And what's their take?", "Don't forget sunscreen.   Have a great trip", "Dear Becky \n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, you suck. I hope the dress looks terrible on you. \ud83d\udc85", "Your brother and his fiance should be sent screen shots of some of the best responses.

Your Bro and SIL have to be real Sh*theads to think you shouldn\u2019t mind not being reimbursed for the dress, amongst all the crazy the SIL put you through. I am so sorry, this is legit awful.", "The quote from dad killed me hahaha", "Becky, Sarah and your brother sucks. What a cheapskate Becky is, doesn't even offer full amount for the dress too. This isn't a charity. \n\nGood luck to your brother with that piece of work.", "The dress was ridiculously expensive to begin with, and expecting you to just hand it over after saving for months is unfair. Making you feel like you were part of the team and then just kicking you out on a whim was also unfair. You do not owe them anything. In fact, they owe you an apology and from the sounds of it some of that thousands you've spent paid back. \n\nTake lots of photos of yourself having a blast with a huge smile and make sure they'll see them!", "Gotta love your mom! Alas your bro couldn't learn much from her.", "Treasure your mom! Every day, I wish my mom was still here.", "ESH - you are an asshole for how you handled this situation.\n\nThey are the assholes because they didn't see your side.\n\nThe bottom line is that you sacrificed many years of having a nice relationship with your family over this.

Anyways, have a GREAT time!", "I just don\u2019t understand how they can\u2019t get it through their thick skulls it\u2019s their attitude and treatment towards you! The dress is just a small part of the manifestation of their terrible behavior", "Enjoy your vacation without worries!!!  I'm glad you're standing firm in this decision.", "Glad you stood firm and didn\u2019t let them have that dress! Enjoy Miami!", "Because he\u2019s long dead, I am HOWLING.", "I've been waiting for this update! It didn't disappoint. Way to hold your ground,  and get your vacation. Also, I hope at some point your FSIL learns that important events in a person's life shouldn't require sacrifices of those around them, especially those of dignity. Assistant flower girl. For real.", "Your coworker is a real one. Your brother and FSIL are absolutely still TA. Enjoy Miami guilt-free!", "Your story blew mind. Next level selfish and hurtful.\nIt\u2019s really a no brainer.\nI hope she blossoms into a better person someday, because that was such a crappy way to treat you.\nHave so much fun, I\u2019m a little jealous", "Wow - my husband and I paid for our wedding party\u2019s attire.  Getting married is about celebrating love with people who love you; certainly not 800$ dresses, or room at a f*^%!g table. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re headed to Miami. Have a blast!!!!!!!", "Wonderful mother right there. Five star parenting!", "After reading the original post, then the update, I'm absolutely appalled at how your brother and fsil have treated you!\nI'd definitely be going on holiday & have absolutely zero remorse about doing so.", "did you get the $800 back?", "I just went to read your post and that\u2019s ridiculous. Brides get wedding gowns for $800! My bridesmaids\u2019 dresses were ~$100 that I paid for. Enjoy your trip!", "So glad people roasted them on Reddit and probably on TikTok. What was their reaction to seeing how many people just lit their a**es on fire? You need another update about that!", "I love this update. I'm sorry for the way your brother and FSIL treated you, but I'm glad you are going to go on your trip. Have an amazing (guilt-free) time!", "They have made their choice.  Most of the people at this wedding will be forgotten in a few years, yet this guy expects you to be at his funeral.", "Rock on and enjoy Miami!

We need that sub.", "Watch them find the update post & this blow up in your face again \ud83d\ude02 (but in all seriousness I hope it doesn't & you have fun but like maybe not a great idea to have this posted before the day of)", ">if you're gunna be an asshole don't be upset when someone's an asshole back\"\n\nI hope your mother said this to the couple instead of to you. \n\nI remember commenting on your original post to take up your coworkers offer. I hope you have a blast in Miami.", "Thank you for the update! Have a great time in Miami!", "Excellent update. And have a safe and great time in Miami. Check out Club Space if you get a chance. I'm a house / techno music fan and Miami is a hotspot for that music. Club Space is one of the best clubs in the United States. But I digress. Glad your mother is on your side and is showing you via her actions and being honest to your what sounds like an insufferable FSIL with your Brother that should make a better effort in defending you if he generally has a good moral compass.", "Have fun! I hope your brother and fsil saw all the comments and so know what we all think of them! Pleased your mother paid your hotel bill, and hope she is referring to your brother and fsil being the arseholes who shouldn't be surprised that you were an arsehole back (not that I think you were, but I hope she isn't seeing it the other way around, which is how I first read it).", "Prepare for future demands by this gloriously entitled couple for free babysitting time.", "Seriously. I read the 1st post and I can't believe the FSIL at first wanted to be friends (or at least appear to be) by making OP a bridesmaid, and then turned around and not only found someone she liked more, but tried to get an $800 dress for that person for free.\n\nI would never speak to these people again.", ">Your bro and FSIL are some real un-self-aware, clueless AHs\n\nTrust me...

She told them all to let her put the dresses on her card so she could get the points to use for planes and hotels and they would give her the money. Your SIL might have been running a scam with the bridal shop or wedding planner. $800 is insane for a bridesmaid\u2019s dress, then they wanted to take it from you. They might have been scared you\u2019d see it was actually much cheaper when you randomly walked into the shop to return it.
