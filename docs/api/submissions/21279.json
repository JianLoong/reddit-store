I've been in therapy since I was 5 years old to help mitigate these arguments. I will admit that he has had mental difficulty since he was young. Mostly ADHD and some very intense OCD. I have inherited this and end up clashing with him a lot. I have had countless nights where I cried myself to sleep because of what he has said to me. My mom (52F) and sister (16F) also argue with him, but not even close to the amount that I do. It has gotten to the point where I have worked my schedule around him so that we will never see each other, (he goes to work early in the morning and I work late nights when he gets home).  \n\t\tRecently my mom and sister went on a trip, which left me and my dad alone in the house. (he doesn't work as much during the summer and i don't have school so we are stuck at home.) I decided to move into my grandma's house for the week since she lives a few miles away. The night before I left I made myself some popcorn. I accidentally left the popcorn salt on the table. The next morning when I was driving (I have that phone thing in my car) my dad called me telling me to turn around and put the salt away. I told him no, I was over halfway there and it's a half an hour drive, and grandma already had brunch on the table for me and I didn't want it to get cold. I hung up and continued driving.  \n\tI proceed to get calls back-to-back all the way there and let them ring. Once I got to grandmas, he started calling her. We have life360 so he can see my location. She ignored them, per my request. But about 20 mins in she decided to answer, told me to go in the other room and let her talk. The angel she is, told my dad that I was busy helping her with a project and wouldn't be able to make it back that night. Since \u201cshe had dibs on me\u201d, and hung up. He texted me saying he would break my computer in my room if I didn't come home and put the salt away.   \nI called him in a panic hoping he didn't already break it. (he has done this before). He laid into me saying that he was instilling good habits and that I should listen to my father. I started crying and screaming at him. Telling him things like \u201cI wish you would treat me as half as nice as my sister\u201d and \u201cI wish he never met my mom\u201d etc. At this point I was fed up with his insanity and just wanted to shut up and let me have a nice week with my grandmas. So I yelled \u201cI WON'T CRY AT YOUR FUNERAL AND I HOPE ROT IN HELL '' he went silent for a minute then hung up. I then got an angry text from my mom saying that I should apologize and I really hurt him. Honestly I was telling the truth and decided to not cry at his funeral at the ripe age of 8.

I really dislike your dad. and for him to flip over such little things only makes me worry for how we reacts about other things. I hope you move out asap doll", "Well first of all, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re venting. It\u2019s healthy, and it sounds rough. \n\nI\u2019m a 33 year old man. I don\u2019t have much in common with a woman whose 17. Let me tell you my story. My life with my dad was always rough. He pushed me into fighting him multiple times, just by getting in my face, and I\u2019m a fighter. I love to fight so much, I joined the Marines and became a martial arts instructor. \n\nTo this day, I can remember the exact moment I knew my dads and my relationship was never going to be the same. I thought it was over, honestly. I was 17, and was going through driving school, and one day my dad asked me to clean my room. He told me I had until the end of the weekend or he\u2019d throw my shit out. I had driving classes all day on Saturday, so I figured I\u2019d dedicate a few hours to it on Sunday, and get it done. No big deal right? I came home on Saturday to find my dad not home, all my things in the trash, including several musical instruments I had bought with my own money. Expensive things I had saved up for. I texted him \u201cWTF?!?!\u201d And he responded \u201cI assumed you weren\u2019t going to get it done, so I took preemptive action and got rid of all your shit!\u201d I was livid. I destroyed his computer, walked out, and walked the three miles to my moms house (divorced parents). \n\nIt\u2019s been 16 years since that day. I still think about it often. My dad and I have mended our relationship to something civil. I don\u2019t hate him anymore, but I\u2019ll never truly love him either. He\u2019s done stuff for me? I won\u2019t deny\u2026but he hasn\u2019t been there in the biggest moments. Last week, his wife, my stepmom, was diagnosed with dementia. My wife asked me what we would do, and I basically said, \u201cFuck it, that\u2019s their problem. They pushed me towards independence so they can be the same as they expected a young teen to be. Independent.\u201d \n\nYour dad has no idea the long term damage he\u2019s doing in pushing a teen to this over absolutely petty shit. \n\nNTA OP. You\u2019ll probably be thinking of this moment for the rest of your life.", "NTA. Does he do stuff like this often? Threaten to destroy your stuff/actually destroy it when he doesn't get his way? Forgetting to put something up happens to people all the time, and the punishment doesn't even come close to fitting the crime.\n\nWhile it isn't exactly nice of you to say that, he is the one who chose to push you so far. Some people, including adults need to realize you can't push so hard on people and expect them to not snap eventually. Your dad especially since it seems he has been pushing you too far for too long. Is living with grandma an option?\n\nInfo I'd add would be if mom usually sides with him and grandma's feelings on him as a whole.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ve had thoughts like you had once in my life when I was so emotionally charged and I did actually do the same to my dad where I yelled at him. But in that moment I didn\u2019t mean it, and your situation is completely different since it shows how much your dad is impacting you so I don\u2019t blame you for what you said to him. It makes sense you need to vent your anger and it came out so I don\u2019t blame you for anything, was it harsh? Yea but there\u2019s no point dwelling on it now, it was said and it\u2019s over with. If your dad wants to hang onto those words and try and guilt you with them don\u2019t let him, it\u2019s likely that this moment will be held over your head as some sort of thing that will be brought up. So all I can say is be strong and roll with the punches, what you think is already out so all you can do is not let yourself lose sleep over this and think that you\u2019re a bad person for saying that to your father. I hope things improve for you later on down the road so be strong!", "Over salt?\n\nTelling him to rot in hell was far \n\nBut all that was over table salt", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
