They can't sell to non-response but they can sell to people who feel bad about being rude, guilt is a very effective in which is why he tried going down that road.\n\nAlso if it feels they are being overly harassing you can complain to Costco, they will have the vendor swap out salesmen after too many complaints.", "NTA, well played", "NTA.
