Someone in the comments thought they had found my boyfriend based on the name I used for him. I don\u2019t want people being involved in this just because I happened to use their name\n\nLong time reddit lurker here, I felt like I needed to post this for some outside perspective, hence the throwaway account and fake names. Here's a little bit of backstory.\n\nI (18F) have been dating my boyfriend Caeden (18M) for over a year. We met when he moved to my city to play hockey. Because Caeden isn't living with his family during the hockey season, he spends a lot of time hanging out at my house and family. My sister Kylie (15F)  comes with me to most of Caeden's hockey games and she wears his jersey. Last year, during high school Caeden and I would skip class to take Kylie to her therapy appointments then we'd all go out for lunch after. Since then Kylie always wants to tag along with Caeden and I when we hangout too.\n\nAt first I though it was cute, but I've noticed recently that she's getting a little too persistent.The other night she wanted to hang out with Caeden and I in my room while we watched a movie. She brings him up in conversation a lot more with me and apparently she's also been researching and keeping up with his hockey stats. \n\nCaeden gave me his hockey cards with cute little messages written on them, and I keep them on my bookshelf in my room. I noticed a few weeks ago that one of them was missing (The one that had 'couldn't do all this without you babe' written on it), and Kylie had it in the back of her phone case. We got into a fight about it where Kylie told me she didn't think it was a big deal because he was her 'favourite player'. \n\nI finally snapped last night when she started asking me if she could come with us on our trip to Montreal. (My best friend is turning 18 in a few weeks and my friends and Caden's friends are going on a road trip to Montreal so we can take her to bar and party all weekend) I tried to tell Kylie she couldn't come because she wouldn't be old enough to go out to the bars and clubs with us. That's when she texted Caeden and told him that I was being 'rude and antagonizing' her. Kylie asked Caeden not to go on the trip and stay home with her instead. After Caeden told me, I confronted Kylie and told her to stay the fuck away from my boyfriend. \n\nCaeden thinks that I'm completely in the right, whereas some of my family believes that Kylie is just a harmless girl with a little crush and that I took it too far.\n\nAITA for telling my sister to stay the fuck away from my boyfriend?", "created_utc": 1670455843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfhw33/aita_for_telling_at_my_younger_sister_to_stay_the/", "score": 1774, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's literally still a child, and clearly has some issues because she needs some type of therapy.

No one is blaming Caeden for this behavior.\n\nBut when a child is crushing on an adult, I think it's prudent for the adult to have a solid voice in explaining that this is inappropriate and unwelcome. That way the child can't pretend the adult is really interested and it's just these jealous a-holes standing in the way. Of course I absolutely don't think that conversation should be had with only the sister and Caeden. But I think it would be helpful for Caeden 's voice to be heard", "Your boyfriend is wise to create distance, even more if he can.

You,bf and mom need to sit down and establish some boundaries. She is not a \"little girl\" and is clearly trying to do something. Bf is uncomfortable about it, you are too.

I\u2019m sorry but your sister is a Reddit post subject in the making (i.e.\u2014 sibling cheated with partner). I feel it\u2019s important to get ahead of this type of behavior instead of blowing it off like it\u2019s \u2018just a little crush\u2019. If no one teaches her how wrong it is to go after someone who\u2019s involved with someone else, how will she know? Honestly, these are the types of interpersonal morals that parents often overlook teaching and then they\u2019re all surprised when the crap hit the fan. In addition, it\u2019s not as if she\u2019s some 10 year old kid with a crush and has some older sister envy. This girl went so far as to basically proposition her sister\u2019s boyfriend when there is only a three year age difference.
