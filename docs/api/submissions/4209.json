Someone in the comments thought they had found my boyfriend based on the name I used for him. I don\u2019t want people being involved in this just because I happened to use their name\n\nLong time reddit lurker here, I felt like I needed to post this for some outside perspective, hence the throwaway account and fake names. Here's a little bit of backstory.\n\nI (18F) have been dating my boyfriend Caeden (18M) for over a year. We met when he moved to my city to play hockey. Because Caeden isn't living with his family during the hockey season, he spends a lot of time hanging out at my house and family. My sister Kylie (15F)  comes with me to most of Caeden's hockey games and she wears his jersey. Last year, during high school Caeden and I would skip class to take Kylie to her therapy appointments then we'd all go out for lunch after. Since then Kylie always wants to tag along with Caeden and I when we hangout too.\n\nAt first I though it was cute, but I've noticed recently that she's getting a little too persistent.The other night she wanted to hang out with Caeden and I in my room while we watched a movie. She brings him up in conversation a lot more with me and apparently she's also been researching and keeping up with his hockey stats. \n\nCaeden gave me his hockey cards with cute little messages written on them, and I keep them on my bookshelf in my room. I noticed a few weeks ago that one of them was missing (The one that had 'couldn't do all this without you babe' written on it), and Kylie had it in the back of her phone case. We got into a fight about it where Kylie told me she didn't think it was a big deal because he was her 'favourite player'. \n\nI finally snapped last night when she started asking me if she could come with us on our trip to Montreal. (My best friend is turning 18 in a few weeks and my friends and Caden's friends are going on a road trip to Montreal so we can take her to bar and party all weekend) I tried to tell Kylie she couldn't come because she wouldn't be old enough to go out to the bars and clubs with us. That's when she texted Caeden and told him that I was being 'rude and antagonizing' her. Kylie asked Caeden not to go on the trip and stay home with her instead. After Caeden told me, I confronted Kylie and told her to stay the fuck away from my boyfriend. \n\nCaeden thinks that I'm completely in the right, whereas some of my family believes that Kylie is just a harmless girl with a little crush and that I took it too far.\n\nAITA for telling my sister to stay the fuck away from my boyfriend?", "created_utc": 1670455843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfhw33/aita_for_telling_at_my_younger_sister_to_stay_the/", "score": 585, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Situations like this and where the one with the crush has their heart broken by the one they're crushing on can end badly when the first person is a minor and doesn't understand some words have consequences (I.e. If she says in the heat of a moment a certain lie that can ruin his life. Happened to a family member when he turned his sister's friend down and said friend waited until he was out to say she lied)", "Do you think you and your bf might want to tell her off (so you speak) together? If you are the only one saying anything it probably just looks like you are jealous of your little sister. It might have more impact if the bf says he's not interested and her behavior makes him uncomfortable.", "NTA, sounds like your sis got a crush that has gone too far. I agree with others that she does indeed need to keep her distance from him, it appears her feelings and actions became inappropriate. Best of luck to you!", "I'm so sorry. \n\nYou're NTA, but your sister is fucking your boyfriend", "NTA.  It\u2019s time to have your parents tell her that no intelligent reasonable 18 year old man wants to be with a 15 year old girl.  It doesn\u2019t matter if it hurts her feelings.  She needs to hear the hard truth.", "She\u2019s 15! Of course she\u2019s obsessive. Caeden needs to be straight with her and explain he\u2019s not interested. You being the one to tell her off will just fit in with her star crossed lovers fantasy. She will grow out of it. I\u2019m not sure Caeden isn\u2019t loving the attention.  Screaming and drama is not the fuel you bring to a 15 year old\u2019s fire ( which by the way is not a harmless crush)", "Kind of an AH. She's literally still a child, and clearly has some issues because she needs some type of therapy. She probably just needs a sit down, and a stern conversation on why what she is doing is inappropriate. And to not exit the conversation with her until she offers proper feedback on if she understands the situation or not. A clear, \"You need to understand why this is not appropriate and here is why, and it's not your fault thay you feel this way but you can not act out on all of your emotions because all humans must exercise a moderate amount of control and I expect not to see anymore of this behavior or we will have this conversation again do you understand?\" The younger sister just needs to process her emotions and family members to help her with that. Without clear communication and support, who knows what kind of complexes she'll develope as an adult.", "Also, a lock on your door if you don\u2019t already have one. She needs clear boundaries established.", "I think it\u2019s very important that your bf is speaking up to your sister. She needs to hear it from him, not only you.\n\nNTA\n\nBy the way: your story sound like that your sister has an obsession with your bf and needs to be stopped asap.", "Why would your parents even agree to send their teen on a drinking rampage in Montreal anyway? (I hope you have a nice trip! But don\u2019t let your boyfriend do anything stupid, it\u2019s a tough year for drafts) \n \nYour sister is being ridiculous.", "Nah, granted I\u2019m not too far south of you, my state is known for hockey \ud83e\udd70\ud83c\udfd2 \n\nMake sure Caden is never ever alone with her. Ever. For his own safety, and he really should let his coach or another trusted staff member of the team what\u2019s going on just in case your sister pulls any stunts that could get him in trouble.", "Strong feelings change people for better or worst. It\u2019s a good idea to be cautious and warn your BF against ever being alone with her. For his safety.", "I was thinking the same thing.    \nShe\u2019ll either try something then claim he assaulted her when he rejects her or get pregnant to someone else and claim it\u2019s his", "I'm not the person you were responding to, but I'd say yes and it's not victim blaming. No one is blaming Caeden for this behavior.\n\nBut when a child is crushing on an adult, I think it's prudent for the adult to have a solid voice in explaining that this is inappropriate and unwelcome. That way the child can't pretend the adult is really interested and it's just these jealous a-holes standing in the way. Of course I absolutely don't think that conversation should be had with only the sister and Caeden. But I think it would be helpful for Caeden 's voice to be heard", "Your boyfriend is wise to create distance, even more if he can. It's important they are never alone together because even the potential appearance of something untoward could ruin his life.\n\nNot for a minute. She doesn't have to do a thing to make rumors fly and the age difference DOES matter significantly."]}
