Someone in the comments thought they had found my boyfriend based on the name I used for him. I don\u2019t want people being involved in this just because I happened to use their name\n\nLong time reddit lurker here, I felt like I needed to post this for some outside perspective, hence the throwaway account and fake names. Here's a little bit of backstory.\n\nI (18F) have been dating my boyfriend Caeden (18M) for over a year. We met when he moved to my city to play hockey. Because Caeden isn't living with his family during the hockey season, he spends a lot of time hanging out at my house and family. My sister Kylie (15F)  comes with me to most of Caeden's hockey games and she wears his jersey. Last year, during high school Caeden and I would skip class to take Kylie to her therapy appointments then we'd all go out for lunch after. Since then Kylie always wants to tag along with Caeden and I when we hangout too.\n\nAt first I though it was cute, but I've noticed recently that she's getting a little too persistent.The other night she wanted to hang out with Caeden and I in my room while we watched a movie. She brings him up in conversation a lot more with me and apparently she's also been researching and keeping up with his hockey stats. \n\nCaeden gave me his hockey cards with cute little messages written on them, and I keep them on my bookshelf in my room. I noticed a few weeks ago that one of them was missing (The one that had 'couldn't do all this without you babe' written on it), and Kylie had it in the back of her phone case. We got into a fight about it where Kylie told me she didn't think it was a big deal because he was her 'favourite player'. \n\nI finally snapped last night when she started asking me if she could come with us on our trip to Montreal. (My best friend is turning 18 in a few weeks and my friends and Caden's friends are going on a road trip to Montreal so we can take her to bar and party all weekend) I tried to tell Kylie she couldn't come because she wouldn't be old enough to go out to the bars and clubs with us. That's when she texted Caeden and told him that I was being 'rude and antagonizing' her. Kylie asked Caeden not to go on the trip and stay home with her instead. After Caeden told me, I confronted Kylie and told her to stay the fuck away from my boyfriend. \n\nCaeden thinks that I'm completely in the right, whereas some of my family believes that Kylie is just a harmless girl with a little crush and that I took it too far.\n\nAITA for telling my sister to stay the fuck away from my boyfriend?\n\nUPDATE: So here's a quick summary of what happened today. Kylie came and apologized to Caeden and I and gave back the hockey jersey with Caeden's name on it that we had given her. We told her that Caeden wouldn't be around as much for the next month or so. My mom talked to Kylie's therapist today and explained the situation. \n\nFor all the people telling Caeden and I to move out, that's not something we have the plans for or the funds for atm. We'll see how things are in the next month or so and talk to her therapist about Caeden and Kylie beeing around each other again. And that's pretty much it", "created_utc": 1670455843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfhw33/aita_for_telling_at_my_younger_sister_to_stay_the/", "score": 3461, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It might be time to start hanging out at his billet\u2019s house (if you\u2019re allowed). \n\nBut NTA.", "NTA\u2026yikes", "Teen crushes can get very intense, and it needs to be nipped in the bud (or she might take some actions she doesn't have the pre-frontal cortex to really think through and that could permanently damage your BF's reputation/career). \n\nShe needs to know that 1. he is 18 years old and legally an adult. 2. he is in a committed relationship with you (her sister). 3. her behaviour is out of line and cannot go on, this will hurt but she needs to give up on the crush. \n\nHopefully, you'll all laugh about it years down the line. \n\nI had a work friend who had a very obsessive crush on our boss years ago. She was married and so was he. He was very professional with her and there was no indication that he felt something more for her and she confided in me and said she felt so intensely for him, she kind of wanted to even just let him know so she could feel better. I told her that this was unprofessional, that she could ruin her own family and his and potentially hinder both of their careers. I told her that most of all, if he didn't feel the same (which was very likely the case), his professional opinion of her would be shattered (he thought she was an exceptional employee (which she was) and she was in a talent management plan based on his recommendation). That was the one thing that convinced her. She took steps to distance herself from him as much as possible and eventually got promoted out of the office. She worked on her marriage and fell back in love with her husband and to this day, she swears she doesn't know what got into her, he wasn't even that special of a guy. I think it's the way he took her under his wing professionally and made her feel like she was special/competent and destined for more in the office (a feeling she didn't get at home at the time).", "Nta. This is dangerous for caeden though, especially since your sister is a minor. If she gets upset enough about him rejecting her then she could start making very explicit accusations against him that could ruin both his life and his hockey career. Please start recording and taking notes on any/all interactions she instigates with caeden.", "NTA, it\u2019s great when our families like our respective significant others, but this takes it to a whole other level.  Shut it down pronto.  It\u2019s shitty, I know my boyfriend is like an older brother to my little sister, and by the sounds of things, you two have been nothing but supportive and inclusive towards her.  I do think/hope this is something she will grow out of, but for now, I totally agree with most other comments about distancing your boyfriend from her.", "...I sense a golden child on the rise. NTA. \n\nThe next step we've seen in a lot of other posts is where the parents hint that the boyfriend would be so much cuter with the younger sister, and he'd be protective and they know and trust him. \n\nSiblings should keep out of the pants of their siblings partners. That's what a crush is about - it's attraction and desire to do sexual things. It's gross and inappropriate no matter how it goes down.\n\nAgree with others, taking some space sounds smart. Just not inviting her along on shared dates with him seems sensible.", "NTA kiddo has a very unhealthy escalating crush on your guy and her therapist needs to be made aware so they can get her off that destructive path. This is how stalkers are born. Please activate her mental health support system. Involve the therapist, parents need to understand this isn't harmless anymore and not indulge the fantasy she's in. And her being a minor as well is sketchy territory because of she gets angry and levels accusations at your BF he's gonna land in undeserved hot water.", "Your family is probably right, she's ultimately harmless and getting carried away, your boyfriend seems to understand that and you have nothing to worry about there. However, that doesn't make it ok or mean it won't get worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. Your sister is clearly too attached to your boyfriend and it isn't good. It's just trouble for many many other reasons and it's definitely better there is some distance there. I'm guessing your bf understands that now seeing how far she's going. Hopefully you're able to get space where you the two of you are removed from everyone in the near future.", "Uhmmmm no.\n\nNTA.\n\nI think you need and Caeden need to find a new place just for ya'll.  This is getting out of hand.", "NTA at all", "Nta", "This is not a crush. This is bordering on obsessed. Your family is saying crush because she\u2019s a girl. If it was a boy behaving this way, everything would be different. ALSO, if this makes your BF uncomfortable (which it SHOULD), that should be enough for your folks to say something to your sister. Because she\u2019s breaking boundaries being set. NTA", "NTA - years ago a friend and her boyfriend of 10 years (they were childhood sweethearts) got engaged and started planning their wedding.  Another friend's 15 yr old sister had what we all thought was a huge crush on him.  Little did we know how far she would go to get him.  Let's just say when I got home from university, I was told that the wedding was off.  A month later, the ex-BF and the other friends sister were getting married.  She was 6 months pregnant.", "NTA.  Kylie does not have an adult sense of appropriate boundaries or even behavior.  Keeping a distance between your bf and sister is wise.", "NTA it's a \"little crush\" until it isn't.", "NTA that ain't a harmless crush, your minor sister is actively trying to steal your legally adult boyfriend (which is disturbing on it own)", "If your boyfriend is true to you, what\u2019s your worry?", "If you can, I would start thinking of getting a place of your own.", "If she was 12, it would be a harmless crush. In the Stone Age, when I was in high school, there were definitely 15 year old girls dating 18 year old guys.", "I think it's the traveling to your city to play hockey thing, hockey-as-a-job at 18 years old seems uniquely Canadian", "I definitely think you need a proper conversation, and I strongly recommend your bf to be there to say \"I do not see you like that, and would never see you like that, because you are a child.\" (Approx.) Maybe your mother separately can talk to her about how it's normal to feel these things but she needs to learn to see objects of her affection as people and keep her shit together in general.\n\nI think the original \"keep away from my boyfriend\" was understandable but not great framing, as it moves it from a discussion about her being super inappropriate and making both of you uncomfortable to a sort of tug of war over something you both want, and that's not terribly effective.\n\nI really hope you can get through to her! It's super creepy for your bf in particular.", "I\u2019m sorry for what she has been through. She has probably fixated on your boyfriend as she is seeing what a good, healthy partner is and because he is someone she feels comfortable with. He should definitely distance himself from her to give her time to move on. Is she still in therapy? Maybe your mom can mention the concerns to the therapist so they can begin to work on it", "I'm so sorry to hear that happened to your sister. It may also explain why she's zeroing in on your own bf if he feels \"safe\" to her, but this really just enforces the fact that her therapist needs to know about all of this. Would she be more receptive to hearing from Caeden himself that she is crossing a boundary that HE, someone with NO attraction to her, is extremely uncomfortable with? Or if someone explained the kind of danger latching onto an older man can put her in right now, especially if she's picking fights at the same time?\n\nBest of luck to all of you!", "funny because I'm Canadian and assumed northern US because so many of our hockey kiddos go to hockey schools and whatnot in the states.\n\nETA I assumed bf was Canadian", "Yeah, I was thinking this. If anything, perhaps Caeden and OP should go together, so he has the sister of the crazy one backing him up. That way, if there is an accusation, Caeden won't start with 0-1, but with 1-0.", "I know literally nothing about Canadians nor do I care to.", "except that Atlantic Canada is part of QMJ too so could be in NB, NS, PEI too", "She could ruin his whole career. Keep the obsessed 15yo far away from him!", "I completely agree. The sister being bold enough to even ask the boyfriend to stay home is insane!", "His career, and his life! Shit sticks."]}
