She is 2 months pregnant. She announced it at dinner with the family and there was a good 10 seconds of silence where nobody said anything.

The family started laughing and joking and making suggestions of their own. I showed her that I was very unsure about the news she shared and she definitely expected a much happier reaction, and was upset with me that I made it about her birth control. Even my mother was unhappy. She knew that she would throw her baby on her and that she'd have no time to herself. \n\nI love her baby and I'm sure I'll love the next one, too. I just don't feel happy about how she is ruining her own life, health and dragging other members of the family downhill with her, because of her irresponsible negligence. It doesn't affect me so much, but affects our mother who is disabled and a total pushover. We are normally a very close, tightknit family who see each other frequently.\n\nAITA for slightly humiliating my sister and showing her I'm not too happy about her pregnancy?\n\n\nNecessary edit: My mother can't confront her because my sister becomes very defensive and accusatory and gaslights people when confronted with how her behavior affects people.

She is behaving recklessly and you called it out.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with choosing to be a single mother if you are of a stable life to raise one.  But when you lay the responsibility on the grandparent, you're really just a single baby factory.", "NTA.\n\nSocial custom should not dictate that we blindly congratulate others, especially when their actions hurts those we care for. The custom of having to congratulate someone's pregnancy should be considered within the context of (1) that person's ability to provide for the baby, and (2) their pregnancy's impact on those that they are dependent on.\n\n**Your sister's responsibility to her children**\n\nWhen you bring new life into the world, you owe it to your child to already be in a position where you can provide it a reasonable quality of life.\n\nHere's why I think your sister has failed this standard:\n\n* your sister is incapable of raising her child independently;\n* your sister is having a child with someone who she barely knows, and has since proven to be as incompetent as she is, given that the couple is relying on your mother to raise the child; and\n* your sister is reliant on your mother\u2014who is disabled and is in no position to raise a child\u2014when she shouldn't be, especially considering that your mother might not be capable of providing that level of assistance long term.\n\nAnd, yet, your sister decided to have a second child? Like you said: recklessly negligent.\n\n**The impact of your sister's pregnancy on those around her**\n\nYour mother is disabled. Your sister should know, or ought to know, that it is unfair to expect your mother to run herself into the ground for your sister's benefit. Even if your mother agreed to assist, insist even, it requires only a basic level of self awareness to understand that this assistance is at least partly driven by obligatory guilt. A considerate daughter would not put her mother in that situation.\n\n**My reasons for the judgment**\n\nYour comments weren't outrageously rude. It just wasn't blindly congratulatory. It also stemmed from feelings of protectiveness for your mother, rather than any maliciousness against your sister. In my opinion, your heart was in the right place, and your actions weren't so distasteful that you need to be condemned regardless of the extenuating circumstances.", "You need to have a private talk with your mom to see how she feels about babysitting and other support she gives. You are NTA, but I am more concerned with your mom\u2019s inability to stand up for herself. Sad.", "NTA \u2014 if it was just her and she took care of what she made on her on then I would say it wasn\u2019t warranted. However, when she puts Her responsibilities on others then it is nothing holding anyone back. Obviously you were not the only one who feels this way.", "NTA. Only because I know the frustration of seeing someone who shouldn\u2019t be having kids thinking it\u2019s okay to just pop em out and let everyone else take care of them.  \n\nIt\u2019s irresponsible, and needs to start getting called out on. Maybe then these people WILL actually use birth control.", "NTA. You need to keep the jokes coming. Since your mother won't say no, you should advocate for her with your pointed humor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Anything could happen especially when the baby starts crawling or walking. It will just get worse and it seems like your mom isn\u2019t capable of watching the baby. Say no for your mom and let your mom be in peace.", "So, what you are saying is she was barely 3 months post partum when she got pregnant again. \n\nNTA. I've been in the position of watching a sibling take advantage of a parent and it is REALLY hard to see when the parent doesn't stand up to them. Its time to be VERY blunt with your sister. Like, FULLY call her out for her reliance on your Mom.", "YTA. Silence was an option.", "YTA.  Talking to sister privately would be better.  Talking to mom to help her understand she can set boundaries regarding childcare would be better.  Talking to sister privately to make it clear how she is hurting mom would be better.  Public humiliation is not the correct answer to this question.", "YTA.\n\n> I love her baby and I'm sure I'll love the next one, too.\n\nThen you swallow the \u201cjokes\u201d and congratulate her, or at the very least express your concerns seriously but sympathetically.  You don\u2019t offer her up as a laughingstock to the entire family, especially when your mom\u2019s perfectly capable of having her own conversation about making sure Sis is aware there\u2019s a limit to how much childcare she can expect (assuming Mom\u2019s actually prepared to enforce that).", "ESH. Sounds like a sarcastic family. My family had a similar reaction to my sister's second pregnancy, and the pregnancy wasn't immediately after the first. She had to know the news would not be taken well. Getting pregnant three months after giving birth is not ideal, and a lot of people would think it was irresponsible.", "The title says \"not congratulate\" and for that not TA.\n\nBut the text of your question goes beyond silence and mentions humiliation and for that YWBTA.\n\nUsing shame to educate people not only doesn't work it makes the so called teacher an asshole.", "So your married sister who dotes on her baby - though gets help from your mother - is pregnant again with her husband's child and your response is to tell her that she needs to switch birth control?   \nHow do you even know that she didn't plan this baby? Did she specifically say \"I am accidentally knocked up again?\" or did she just share that she was pregnant again and you jumped to that assumption?   \n\n\nRight now I'm going YTA. Your sister may not be the world's greatest mother or daughter here, but you sure have a lot of condescension dripping from this post.", "YTA.  That would be a private conversation, IMO.  If you were trying to humiliate her in front of the family, I'm sure you succeeded.  It isn't your business if your sister has another baby or not.  Do you even like her?", "NTA you", "NTA but your mother doesn\u2019t need to confront her she just needs to learn to tell her no.", "No, I think the sister married the father of her child and is still with him. They are still together and are expecting their second child. \n\n The mother chooses to help her daughter out. I don't see a real problem here, unless I am missing something important.", "The first time she got pregnant, I was very supportive and felt very sympathetic. I threw her a baby shower, helped her shop for things, carried her bags, etc. Mistakes happen and I respect it if people decide to keep their unexpected baby. I just felt like second time around enough was enough and my mother would never say how she felt to her.\n\nTy for your insight on this and the level of detail", "Agreed, making jokes about bc crosses a line.", "Yes not, read the edit", "She did share that both were an accident yes. Perhaps I should have mentioned that.", "It sounds like the problem OP is having is about the expected impact of this pregnancy on their disabled mother who has trouble standing up for herself.", "Yeah I don't get what is so outrageous about a 35yo woman having a second kid with her husband.\n\nIf op is concerned that mom is being taken advantage of, say this to sis. Dont make nasty cracks about lack of birthcontrol at a pregnancy announcement.\n\nThis seems less about concern for mom and more about Op's jealousy. \n\nI rolled my eyes hard about op being pissed that sis is focused on her baby so is not \"emotionally available\" to family.", "You are right, I read that but then ignored it.", "Yes, but that is OP's perspective. It can easily be a jealousy issue.", "You don't see a problem with a woman getting pregnant three months after having her first child? Did you read the post?", "Their perspective could be accurate. So that would be, potentially, a real issue. Either you don't understand that, or you are discounting the possibility that the op's perspective could be accurate. \ud83d\ude43", "It's hard on the body but its this woman's choice. Not my business and not op's either given i) she does not help with the baby ii) she doesnt want to advocate for her mom.\n\nOp says its not her place to tell sis that shes expecting too much of mom but it is her place to make cracks about  BC?? She's just an ass.", "I do understand that. OP's perspective could be accurate, but she should then give some 'proof'.\n\nOP doesn't describe any conflict between the mother and the sister. The only conflict is between her and her sister, because OP doesn't like het sister's choices and the attention she is asking/getting because of it. \n\nShe thinks everything is too much for her mother, but for now, that seems to be just her interpretation.", "Op describes the mother as conflict averse"]}
