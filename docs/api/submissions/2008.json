This baby has also made her emotionally unavailable to family members who have been through health issues and very difficult struggles and makes everything about herself.\n\nSo now she accidentally got pregnant again. She is 2 months pregnant. She announced it at dinner with the family and there was a good 10 seconds of silence where nobody said anything.

She is doing a good job with her baby but she stays with our mom who normally doesn't cook and does minimal chores due to her disability. She now has to do more chores, cook dinner, spend money on more groceries and helps with the baby at least 4 entire days a week. This is a lot on her. She is always tired and I have told her many times that she doesn't have to do all this. She feels that she has to.  \nSister admitted both are unplanned because she forgot her bc. \n\nMore about me: I am in a long term relationship and want children when I am in a better financial situation.

Your sister should know, or ought to know, that it is unfair to expect your mother to run herself into the ground for your sister's benefit.
