I reminded one of my aunts of all the times she would make 10 years old me take care of her 4 kids all under 6 just because she was bored and sick of taking care of them herself.

Then i told them not to call me until they decide to apologize for bearding me and i left. \n\nThey're all very mad at me but my siblings and cousins say i could've make my point without making them feel like bad parents. So AITA?\n\nUPDATE!\nMy mom showed up at my apartment demanding that i make a formal apology to the family and berated me for my behavior. Then she went about how disappointed she is that she raised \"such a selfish excuse of a daughter\" then she left. So i sent the following message in the family group chat:\n\"I will not apologize for defending myself and standing my ground. I've put up with y'all for too long and I'm sick of having to justify my choices. I will live the way i see fit because it's my life. This so called family never showed me any love or support.

Who knows what the future brings.  I get it.  I was in my early 20s once.  And thought I had all the answers and knew who I was for the rest of my life.  But the reality is, things change.  Let me posit just one scenario.  Let's say you meet the man of your dreams.  One that you could never conceive loving so much and know you'll never love anyone near that much again.  BUT, no children are a deal breaker for him.  Who knows how you might feel then.  \n\nIt may all seem silly or a tradeoff you're perfectly willing to make now being that it's all hypothetical but if you're in that moment, you may have all sorts of confused feelings.  And it's hard (for me as a male) to understand the biological ticking of a woman's body and what all that bring on.", "I guess my original confusion was that you can choose not to have kids without making such a surgical decision.

I guess you could also have tube reversal surgery if push comes to shove but once again, I don't understand the reason for such a drastic measure.", "If it's a dealbreaker for him, fair enough.  Bearing children is a dealbreaker for her.  People can have dealbreakers about all sorts of things. \n\nI don't think this is a hypothetical thing. She has dealt with poop explosions, screaming kids, and no money. She has had to balance her responsibilities with taking care of children. I think she has enough hard experience to decide if she wants to go through that herself.  \n\nI've had several friends who got their tubes tied or got a vasectomy because they recognized that managing their mental illness was a second fulltime job, and even if they could sustain a healthy adult romantic relationship (which in one case is not the case) they recognized they don't have the bandwidth to have kids.  And you know, I support this. It's a much better decision than just having kids because everyone else is doing it.  \n\nMany women who love their children can also look back at their lives and recognize that if they had turned out to be infertile and hadn't had the kids, they would have had a happy life down that road.

My esophagus is damaged. I have damage to my ankle and wrist ligaments, which relaxed right along with the pelvic ligaments during pregnancy (darn non-specific hormones!)

I NEVER said that you will or would change your mind, nor do I expect you to.  You could not have kids and still not have had the operation is my point.  But you certainly are free to do whatever you want whenever you want, no argument there.  And I empathize with the childhood that you've had.  I'm not sure why you were so willing to bear all that as you got a little older into your teen years.  Most kids would tell those adults to fuck off (more gently but sometimes not).  \n\nBut one thing is undeniably clear.  People change their minds about all kinds of things at various time in their lives.  I'm not remotely saying that will happen to you but if you're that confident, which only you can make the call on, I'm not sure why you're so defensive about it", "As a general rule, I feel that virtually most all folks under 21 and probably mid 20s have no business having kids for so many personal (theirs not mine) and societal reasons.  But obviously they can do whatever they want.  I'm not even sure what the last sentence is supposed to mean.  The OP put up a post and I'm responding, like any other member.  \n\nI'm not sure what all this hyperbole on your part is trying to make it seem like my mission in life is to preach.  The OP can do whatever she wants.  But I'm a VERY rational (almost Spock like) person and I don't see the logic in eliminating an option that didn't need to be."]}
