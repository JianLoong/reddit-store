I've put up with y'all for too long and I'm sick of having to justify my choices. I will live the way i see fit because it's my life. This so called family never showed me any love or support. Even as a kid i was just a free babysitter for your kids. I see you will never respect me or my decisions so i don't see a reason for me to stay in contact with you. Do not contact me again. Ow and btw i had my tubes tied a year ago*insects sike gif* goodbye\" then i blocked them all.\n\nUpdate 2: mom showed up at my work because how dare i talk to my family that way and how dare i not give her grandkids. My boss had to call the police to have her removed because she was hysterical. \n\nI'm going to stay with my bff for a while. I'm looking for a new apartment and a new job.

Bearing children is a dealbreaker for her.  People can have dealbreakers about all sorts of things. \n\nI don't think this is a hypothetical thing. She has dealt with poop explosions, screaming kids, and no money. She has had to balance her responsibilities with taking care of children. I think she has enough hard experience to decide if she wants to go through that herself.  \n\nI've had several friends who got their tubes tied or got a vasectomy because they recognized that managing their mental illness was a second fulltime job, and even if they could sustain a healthy adult romantic relationship (which in one case is not the case) they recognized they don't have the bandwidth to have kids.  And you know, I support this. It's a much better decision than just having kids because everyone else is doing it.  \n\nMany women who love their children can also look back at their lives and recognize that if they had turned out to be infertile and hadn't had the kids, they would have had a happy life down that road.

It was hard, and it was really frustrating. I think it's completely valid to tell them that you have made a choice and that they need to respect it. You can tell them why, and that it was really hard for you. But it can also be true that they both loved being a parent, and felt the need to complain about it occasionally. Should they have complained to you? No. That wasn't yours to deal with, and you can definitely let them know that that wasn't something they should have discussed with you. But I think both can be true. It could have been hard for them, and it can be right for you to not. Ultimately, they need to respect your boundaries and decision.

You may or may not change your mind later on. You might decide you want a dog. You might decide you want to travel. Live your life to the fullest so that when you are in your 50's and 60's you look back and have zero regrets. It's ok to have compassion and kindness, but it is also ok (AND IMPERATIVE!) that you set boundaries and enforce them with extreme prejudice.\n\nDown the road, if you meet a really cool kid who might need a big sister/mentor/someone positively influencing their life, then you can be their friend and give them the benefits of your life experience.\n\nWord of advice: If you are so adamantly opposed to kids now, make that one of your deal breakers for dating. No kids. From previous relationships or even that they are God Parents. Because life happens and you never know when someone will be in a situation where they have to take on guardianship of a god child or minor family member. Later, in the future, you can revisit that boundary on a case by case basis.\n\nI never wanted children. Once I turned 18 I tried so hard to find a doctor to sterilize me. Obviously, that didn't happen. I wound up with 4 kids. Life happened and I got my heart ripped to shreds over those kids. (Long story short, their dad stole them from me and I only was left with my youngest from my second marriage after her dad died.) I always tried to do the right thing. I have literally put myself into an early grave because I felt I had no choices in the matter. I realize now that I am older and wiser, there were choices, I just didn't take them because it meant I would be cutting a great many people and things out of my life; I was still under the illusion that family meant everything. IT DOES NOT! Family isn't about biological ties. It's about people who will be there for you through thick and thin, in sickness and in health. No matter what. Out of my huge extended family on both sides, I can count on one hand the number of them who have been \"family\" to me. The rest of them just wanted to use me for their own ends, then discard me like trash. So, no, do not do that to yourself.\n\nYou will find your place in this world. But it won't be through babysitting for your \"family\", or popping out kids, or marriage, or anything that they are pushing on you. You have to find your own way, and it will be an adventure of a lifetime for you. Do not be afraid to be ruthless and cut out the toxicity of those around you. Don't harden your heart, but do not be afraid to say \"No. And you are NOT someone I want in my life. Goodbye!\". Yes, it will hurt, but it will ease; if you go to a good therapist, they can help you navigate untangling the emotions and becoming a person who has great strength of will and character.\n\nI regret that I am not going to grow old. I regret I will not live to see my daughter as a mature woman. But, I raised her to be strong, independent and to be able to take care of herself. I know she'll be ok.\n\nBut, I wish I had thought to tell my own family to go jump off a cliff back when I was under such heavy pressure to marry and have kids. The thought never crossed my mind while I was young. Now, I have no problem doing that. The look on my uncle's face when he tries to tell me to do something and I say NO. Or say \"That sounds like a you problem, not a me problem. So, no.\". My dad laughs his butt off. And backs me to the hilt. (You'd love my dad. He'd be having these deep conversations with you about what your dreams and goals are, then he'd be like \"Let's do what we can to make it happen!\")\n\nSo, go find your tribe. Find the people who will be your life long friends, who will encourage you to grow into the person you are meant to become. \n\nYou're going to be ok. There are people out there who have been through some stuff and we will offer you love, hugs and a safe space to just be yourself. Because we went through our family breaking us and we came out of it stronger than ever, if a bit sideways.\n\nOne last thing; when you have a chance, look into Walking in Beauty, a Navaho spiritual belief. It might help you find some clarity and a bit of guidance about how you want to proceed on your own path.\n\nIn the meantime, Coyote's blessings upon your family.

Not everyone has these magical life changes. You are making assumptions on nothing. People grow up they mature, but they don't all change their life goals. \nBTW defending your choices is going to be \"defensive\" just like how your responses give the same vibe."]}
