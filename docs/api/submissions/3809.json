Bearing children is a dealbreaker for her.  People can have dealbreakers about all sorts of things. \n\nI don't think this is a hypothetical thing. She has dealt with poop explosions, screaming kids, and no money. She has had to balance her responsibilities with taking care of children. I think she has enough hard experience to decide if she wants to go through that herself.  \n\nI've had several friends who got their tubes tied or got a vasectomy because they recognized that managing their mental illness was a second fulltime job, and even if they could sustain a healthy adult romantic relationship (which in one case is not the case) they recognized they don't have the bandwidth to have kids.  And you know, I support this. It's a much better decision than just having kids because everyone else is doing it.  \n\nMany women who love their children can also look back at their lives and recognize that if they had turned out to be infertile and hadn't had the kids, they would have had a happy life down that road.

It was hard, and it was really frustrating. I think it's completely valid to tell them that you have made a choice and that they need to respect it. You can tell them why, and that it was really hard for you. But it can also be true that they both loved being a parent, and felt the need to complain about it occasionally. Should they have complained to you? No. That wasn't yours to deal with, and you can definitely let them know that that wasn't something they should have discussed with you. But I think both can be true. It could have been hard for them, and it can be right for you to not. Ultimately, they need to respect your boundaries and decision.

Even if you're not connected to it... Those hormones and everything get FUCKED up. It's hard to recover from, it's painful, it's emotional, and being pregnant, in my experience, is hell. You're sick as a dog, can't keep anything down, it's AWFUL. I'm proud of you for doing what you knew was right for your body.", "Thank you and I'm sorry u went thru that", "I appreciate that.

What is that exactly based on?  For the umpteenth time on this thread, all I am saying are two things:\n\n1) People in life tend to change their views and minds on various things as they get older.  That's fact.  It's not judgement, it's not morality, it's not \"belittlement\", it is just the undeniable way of things.  That's not remotely to imply that the OP would change her mind.  But obviously, people do these kinds of things and regret doing them, even if they are in the minority.\n\n2) Not getting her tubes tied was not a decision that HAD to be made.  Sure she can make it and she did.  I'm not judging her for that.  I'm saying that should she ever change her mind, it could be very complicated/difficult if not impossible path to get her fertility back.

I would agree with you if I had a clear better understanding of how the situation will ultimately settle and that access was truly that difficult but I'm not hearing that kind of urgency yet.  In fact, the tide seems to be turning back the other way.  But all this is moot unless the OP had that specific concern, which was never mentioned.", "1.)  why bring that up if not to imply that op would change their mind lol. Some things are set in stone for some people, to imply that op could perhaps change their mind on kids in the future and to keep pushing it when you've little to no idea or comprehension of her experiences is belittlement.\n\n\n\n2.) getting her tubes tied was because she was absolutely sure she didn't want to have kids.

Haaa! I'm childfree by choice, still can't get my tubes tied at 35 but that's my issue, I'm THRILLED that you have and that it's becoming more normalised, gives me hope!

She asked me if I would be disappointed if she didn\u2019t make me a grandma (her words not mine). She is my only child. I told her no because I would rather her realize she doesn\u2019t want kids and protect herself as opposed to having kids and putting them on me to raise them.\n\nI will tell you what I told my daughter.

I have also fantasized about winning the lottery and many other things I can live without. That is NOT a reason for you to have kids. I am happy and proud you are a strong woman who can make her own choices. And I am happy I do not have to worry that you'd be just following expectations.
