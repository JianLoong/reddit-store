By that I mean every woman in my family had at least on child before they were 20. Education was never a priority and even tho they aren't religious they believe that a woman's only purpose is to have kids and the man is the provider. Because of this i have 4 younger siblings and about a dozen of cousins. Being the oldest i had to be a second mother to my siblings and a babysitter for my cousins. This made me realize i don't want kids at the age of 10. 12 years later and my opinion hasn't changed. I don't like kids and i don't want kids.  Last year i had my tubes tied and i didn't tell my family. \n\nThey're trying to push the ideea that I'm nothing and my life in empty without kids on me. I've made my point clear many times but they kept pushing it. \n\nLast night we had a big family dinner and they again tried convincing me to have kids so i shut down everything they said in an not so nice way.\n\nThey were going on and on about how amazing being a mom is and how that's their biggest accomplishment so i reminded them of all the times they complained about having to take care of the kids, all the times the would cuss us out for doing kids things, all the times they would tell us how much they regret having us and how we ruined their lives. I reminded one of my aunts of all the times she would make 10 years old me take care of her 4 kids all under 6 just because she was bored and sick of taking care of them herself. I reminded my dad of all the times he complained about how much money he had to spend on me and my siblings. And of course, i reminded them how they kicked us out at 18 because they don't have to care for us legally speaking.\n\nThen i just said something like \"all my life you've done nothing but complain about having kids and now you're sitting here telling me how kids are the best thing in the world? You're all hypocrites\".  Then i told them not to call me until they decide to apologize for bearding me and i left. \n\nThey're all very mad at me but my siblings and cousins say i could've make my point without making them feel like bad parents. So AITA?\n\nUPDATE!\nMy mom showed up at my apartment demanding that i make a formal apology to the family and berated me for my behavior. Then she went about how disappointed she is that she raised \"such a selfish excuse of a daughter\" then she left. So i sent the following message in the family group chat:\n\"I will not apologize for defending myself and standing my ground. I've put up with y'all for too long and I'm sick of having to justify my choices. I will live the way i see fit because it's my life. This so called family never showed me any love or support. Even as a kid i was just a free babysitter for your kids. I see you will never respect me or my decisions so i don't see a reason for me to stay in contact with you. Do not contact me again.

I know you feel SURE right now, but a person at 18 is different from the same person at 23 and at 28 and so on.  I sincerely hope for your sake that it wasn't a regrettable decision.

In mine, 16 is the average age for parenthood (and no, no one graduates high school). I'm the weirdo who graduated, went to college twice, and - lo and behold - can afford a house and a car and vacations with my kids, that I had at the unthinkable age of 30. \n\nI literally had a cousin my age with 4 kids try to convince me in our 20s to meet a guy at a bar to get knocked up. Like, no, Sarah, I don't want your train wreck of a life. I can wait. My Mom harassed me for years to have grandkids even though 1) she already had 4 (she became a grandma at 40) and 2) I was single.\n\nNot even a religious family. Just a very poor and misguided one.

I bet they won't bring it up for a while.", "Ow yeah the autocorrect sorry", "So 12 years off feeling disgusted by the idee of children isn't enough?", "That's how you feel today.  Who knows what the future brings.  I get it.  I was in my early 20s once.  And thought I had all the answers and knew who I was for the rest of my life.  But the reality is, things change.  Let me posit just one scenario.  Let's say you meet the man of your dreams.  One that you could never conceive loving so much and know you'll never love anyone near that much again.  BUT, no children are a deal breaker for him.  Who knows how you might feel then.  \n\nIt may all seem silly or a tradeoff you're perfectly willing to make now being that it's all hypothetical but if you're in that moment, you may have all sorts of confused feelings.  And it's hard (for me as a male) to understand the biological ticking of a woman's body and what all that bring on.", "I guess my original confusion was that you can choose not to have kids without making such a surgical decision.  I mean, can't you just end a pregnancy if you don't want a child in the event that happens?  I guess you could also have tube reversal surgery if push comes to shove but once again, I don't understand the reason for such a drastic measure.", "If it's a dealbreaker for him, fair enough.  Bearing children is a dealbreaker for her.  People can have dealbreakers about all sorts of things. \n\nI don't think this is a hypothetical thing. She has dealt with poop explosions, screaming kids, and no money. She has had to balance her responsibilities with taking care of children. I think she has enough hard experience to decide if she wants to go through that herself.  \n\nI've had several friends who got their tubes tied or got a vasectomy because they recognized that managing their mental illness was a second fulltime job, and even if they could sustain a healthy adult romantic relationship (which in one case is not the case) they recognized they don't have the bandwidth to have kids.  And you know, I support this. It's a much better decision than just having kids because everyone else is doing it.  \n\nMany women who love their children can also look back at their lives and recognize that if they had turned out to be infertile and hadn't had the kids, they would have had a happy life down that road. Different. But still happy. One isn't better. They're just different. And that's fine. People get to choose."]}
