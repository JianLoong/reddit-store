He offered to make pizza and host boardgames, which he decided to do on his own accord and 2. Did not ask anyone for money for doing so beforehand or say it would cost $$.\n\nSo with a bit of conversation back at forth (since I've never had anyone ask me for money for a home cooked meal)... he said he was asking for money since I asked him for money for fish and chips.\nNow the fish and chips were not home cooked and it has ALWAYS been the case that we pay for ourselves at a restaurant or fast food/take out. And I would expect to give him money if it was the other way round.\n\nI mentioned this to him and he said he sees it differently quote \"a meal for a meal\".\n\nI then asked if he has requested $18 off any of our other friends. Which he said no.\n\nSo I said 'this is unfair and he's changing how we usually handle these sort of situations and specifically targeting me for some reason...\n\nAnd he said it was because the other friends will bring drinks and smokes etc and share it with him, which I do not.\n\nTo which I responded, 'well I don't drink or smoke' and also I've NEVER charged you for a home cooked meal.'\n\nThen some angry messages were sent my way and we have not spoken.\n\nI can send him $18, it's not about the money... It's just how he has handled the situation, is singling me out, and especially charging me after the fact (which has never happened before and is not normal behavior).\n\nAITA for not giving my friend $18 for a home cooked pizza?", "created_utc": 1703778202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18swuee/aita_for_not_repaying_my_friend_18_for_a_pizza/", "score": 1212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Meeting people for the first time and they are hosting dinner, bring a gift, but someone you hang out with all time, I would never expect them to bring anything over...", "I just got home from the shops and I bought enough cheese for like 15+ pizzas for $11", "Yes, but there's also give and take with your comment. \n\nI wouldn't expect my friends to always bring food/drink gifts when I host. But if I have afriend who never brings anything over when I host? That's an issue if it happens a lot.", "Idk, I always bring wine, even though I don\u2019t drink, when it\u2019s an occasion like that with multiple people, like chilling one on one no, but group of friends seeing each other for dinner and games I bring wine, or whatever the host said they needed for dinner, when not wine I\u2019ll always bring something even if they say no like candies or snacks,", "I feel like this is important to the story.", "Unless he\u2019s uncomfortable holding alcohol because of his religion or previous issues, there\u2019s no reason he can\u2019t bring a bottle of wine or a case of beer. \n\nI don\u2019t drink those either, but I will happily buy and bring to a party or bbq as appropriate. I will also always offer a dessert, unless I\u2019m rushed off my feet /last minute.", "I don\u2019t see the point that he doesn\u2019t drink.  He can still bring something. What\u2019s the big deal about picking up something for a few bucks?", "If that's what OPs friend was thinking, then he should just ask him to bring something. \n\nHarboring this level of resentment and then manifesting it like this is ridiculous.", "he is, he is repeatedly showing up everywhere empty handed.  his answers show that this a  regular occurance, he's that cheap friend that never brings any thing and if they help out, they always ask for their money.  YTA my dude, the more I hear OP talk, the more I understand the other guys problem.", "Did he put truffle and caviar on it?", "yeah i totally agree that friend is wrong regardless", "Yeah. I just read his comments. \n\nThe juxtaposition between \u201cBut I don\u2019t expect people to bring anything when I host.\u201d And \u201cI don\u2019t host because I don\u2019t have space.\u201d Really sold me on the YTA verdict. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t have the self awareness to realize that the guy who asked for the pizza money has already discussed the mooching behavior with the broader group and now with his reaction he\u2019s probably lost a whole group of friends.", "I have no idea what the protocol is for non drinkers but I don't show up to anyone's house without at least a 6 pack", "But you rarely host... you said it yourself that he hosts you much more.", "What a weird comment which makes your end of the situation so much worse. If you thought that other people brought things for themselves and just happened to share them....every time, this means it is likely you have been showing up with snacks/drinks for yourself and not sharing.", "This is the way to go. When we have people over and they ask, we tell them \"nothing\" and expect just that. Some will always bring something anyways (Southern Hospitality at its best), but we know who those are and will tell them \"if you just have to bring something, bring <appropriate items, often utensils, ice, drinks, or something they are well-known for cooking to drool-inducing excellence)\"", "Kind of a scummy move to just wordlessly remove him instead of just saying 'hey dude, bring some chips or something next time!'  \n\nClearly he doesn't have a problem with bringing chips and dip or something, he just didn't think to, so the whole situation could have been resolved with someone telling him it's not polite to show up emptyhanded. He's taken it well in the comments at least.\n\nLike it sucks that it didn't occur to him but some people just don't grow up picking up on social rules. Even if he was just dense it's not something worth kicking someone out of a friend group over IMO.", "But OP didn't do that either. This friend hosts consistently and op has never brought anything either for himself or to share", "It's typically referred to as a \"hostess gift\" if you want to Google and read more about how the custom is practiced in your region.\n\nThere are some times it never applies, for example, visiting your parents. \n\nThere are times it always applies, for example if someone other than close family is hosting you for an overnight stay. \n\nAmong friends,  it doesn't have to be EVERY time, like if you pop in for a half hour chat and cup of tea and it doesn't have to exist at all if, say, 4 people rotate hosting duties. \n\nIt's an etiquette breach in this case because op almost never hosts AND always shows up empty-handed when the other guests have demonstrated repeatedly that bringing something to share is expected behavior.", "oh, hints have been given.  this guy has never wanted to hear them. this is the first time that someone is calling him out on his shit and he's on reddit trying to convince himself that he's not a cheap bastard lol.", "I appreciate you thinking of your gluten free friend. I always have to bring my own food to anyone's house because there is never anything for me to eat.", "It's normal etiquette that polite people who like having friends and being invited to things follow. I've known to bring a host gift since I was 7. The gift varies depending on the event -- a bottle of wine is appropriate for a dinner party; a snack or beverage or new game is appropriate for board game night. If someone shows up repeatedly to parties I host and never brings anything, I stop inviting them.", "Interesting! I come from a culture where it\u2019s considered disrespectful to bring a hostess gift and especially to bring a food related gift. So the only time you see it where I\u2019m from is with MILs or DILs who hate each other and use it to signify the other is a bad host", "Maybe I'm just autistic but hints aren't the way to resolve a conflict IMO. Just talk to each other like adults", "Yeah I try! I like to bake so it gives me a chance to try out something new. I made GF cupcakes for my birthday year before last!", "There's definitely nuance to it. And like I indicated, it's different with close family. \n\nIn my social circle, it would be weird/rude to bring an appetizer to a dinner party, where the host has presumably planned a menu.  But a bottle of wine, box of chocolates, or cheap bouquet of flowers would be a welcome hostess gift.  Not a price of admission, but appreciated.\n\nI have a pool, so I have a lot of guests in the summer time. Extended friend/family circle who invite themselves by and then \"subtly\" hint that they're hungry and do I have any snacks available grate after a while. If I'm in the mood, I might fire up the grill and cook some burgers. Or I might start \"subtly\" hinting that you should gtfo and go make your own dinner. It depends on my mood and the guest. \n\nI think game night is closer to my \"friends who drop by to swim\" than my \" friends who are invited to a distinct food-focused event\""]}
