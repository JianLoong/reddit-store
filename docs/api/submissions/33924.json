He offered to make pizza and host boardgames, which he decided to do on his own accord and 2. Did not ask anyone for money for doing so beforehand or say it would cost $$.\n\nSo with a bit of conversation back at forth (since I've never had anyone ask me for money for a home cooked meal)... he said he was asking for money since I asked him for money for fish and chips.\nNow the fish and chips were not home cooked and it has ALWAYS been the case that we pay for ourselves at a restaurant or fast food/take out. And I would expect to give him money if it was the other way round.\n\nI mentioned this to him and he said he sees it differently quote \"a meal for a meal\".\n\nI then asked if he has requested $18 off any of our other friends. Which he said no.\n\nSo I said 'this is unfair and he's changing how we usually handle these sort of situations and specifically targeting me for some reason...\n\nAnd he said it was because the other friends will bring drinks and smokes etc and share it with him, which I do not.\n\nTo which I responded, 'well I don't drink or smoke' and also I've NEVER charged you for a home cooked meal.'\n\nThen some angry messages were sent my way and we have not spoken.\n\nI can send him $18, it's not about the money... It's just how he has handled the situation, is singling me out, and especially charging me after the fact (which has never happened before and is not normal behavior).\n\nAITA for not giving my friend $18 for a home cooked pizza?", "created_utc": 1703778202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18swuee/aita_for_not_repaying_my_friend_18_for_a_pizza/", "score": 724, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend is being weirdly petty.", "NTA.  Volunteering a home cooked meal and then charging $18? Thats insanity", "Turning up empty handed when others don\u2019t is a no no and a bit of an AH move. Could be why he\u2019s really asking, because you turn up empty handed often. \n\nHe\u2019s gone about it in the wrong way and is being a bit of an asshole about it.

He did handle it poorly (both of them did tbh), but he may be right...", "Oh, yeah for sure, $18 is likely covering the whole meal for everyone.\n\n> And he said it was because the other friends will bring drinks and smokes etc and share it with him, which I do not.\n\nIn fact the friend pretty much admits that he is asking OP to pay the full cost of the food for everyone.", "OP doesn't drink.", "right cos in another reply OP said he had thought a few times that he should bring something next time and then never has. and also expressed indignance that the friend didn't just say \"bring something next time\" when imo equally the friend could have been thinking surely he'll bring something next time, for however many times, and then just cracked and requested money to mollify building resentment. another little thing is OP saying a few times that he doesn't drink or smoke or \"usually snack at home\" which i wonder if not snacking at home = not snacking on snacks the friends share? and whether in the past he's said this to reason his way out of chipping in for the group > friend not wanting to get into a thing about who consumed what again so latching onto the pizza which they know OP definitely had some of. this is all speculative though obviously i might be stretching but im just wondering aloud since the friend doesn't sound from other clues to be a penny pincher or something. \nalso wonder if the reason OP isn't able to host as much plays into OP's lower awareness of the effort that might go into it in terms of preparation and cleanup. again total spitball though, could be way off", "I wouldn\u2019t fault your friends for not bringing things when you host since it\u2019s clear you have never brought anything when anyone else has hosted.", "I never expect my guests to bring anything but I also never go anywhere empty handed. I am assuming you\u2019re a guy, but for my girls card club, if my friend that hosts doesn\u2019t need anything, I\u2019ll bring flowers or something homemade for her and her husband at another time, like homemade soup or marinara.", "It really is, I feel if it\u2019s a gathering then it\u2019s a courtesy. If it\u2019s just chilling out and lazing around, nah!\nI go to baby play dates and won\u2019t bring anything if it\u2019s just that, if it\u2019s our little group and partners together going over then we\u2019ll bring a bottle. I\u2019m pregnant atm so not drinking but still come with a little something, you know?", "You can just ask. It literally solves this. If he asks if you'd like to come watch a game, you can say sure, should I bring something? That's it. If it happens often, bring a bag of chips or few bottles of sodas.", "But even still, you're ignoring the facts presented with your assumptions.\n\nOP noted that it was because they don't ever bring anything to help with hosting whereas the other friends do.", "Yeah, if he wants OP to bring stuff, then he just say everyone should bring a snack while he provides the meal when inviting people.\n\nSaying these things up frojt usually prevent situations where you're mad that the other person didn't read your mind.", "Oh no, OP clarified in comments, their friend claims to have spent $100 on pizza ingredients for 6 people, so the $18 is just for their 1/6 share...", "Yeah missed that detail. Even so, bring a 2L of soda or a bag of chips or something. Bring *something*.", "Absolutely. A lot depends to on when I got the invite. Was it a last minute \u201chey come watch the game\u201d or something a bunch of us planned. If the former, I\u2019m probably just heading over.  If it\u2019s the latter, I\u2019m asking and bringing something", "Yeah I understand the concept. I was merely stating that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy rude or bizarre to show up empty handed if someone asks you over for game night, as it depends on the situation and relationship", "But don't show up to a grand potluck barbecue with just a bag of chips, and devour six servings of their barbecue. That would be lazy and rude. :)", "It sounds like everyone provides food when they host, including OP. I\u2019m not going to chip in for drinks and smokes if I don\u2019t drink or smoke.", "That\u2019s wild\nPizza dough is easy to make what kind of toppings did this guy buy to reach $100? Did he buy premade dough from an expensive grocery store? Like jeez", "Yup, I always offer or ask what I can bring if someone is hosting.  If they say nothing, I bring nothing.", "Every time me or a friend has hosted a game night, the host has provided food and non-alcoholic drinks. But it is always switching people's houses, so its not like one person is constantly hosting.", "You should never show up somewhere empty handed when someone is hosting you.", "Idk me and my friends bring our own snacks whenever we hangout and if we wanna share we will. We\u2019re all grown ups who just wanna hangout and not everyone likes the same stuff. When they come over to my place they get chips and drinks for themselves and I do the same when I go to any of their places. The whole goal is hanging out with each other not who\u2019s hosting who\u2019s bringing food and drinks to share who\u2019s doing this and that, just hang out", "It's extremely rude not to and shellfish behaviour", "It's \"normal\" in the sense that it's not *abnormal*.  Of course plenty of normal people have guests over for free.", "Don't feel too bad, I just learned this from this thread myself! I wonder if it's a regional thing or just something we didn't pick up on as kids?", "You just said you almost never host...", "Eh I could see it. Enough good pizza dough for 2 pizzas, tomatoes and herbs and butter and whatnot for a homemade sauce, a good mozerella and pepperoni, maybe some other toppings. Sodas, some chips or fries or something on the side. $100 is a lot for JUST a basic pizza for 6 people but it's not unthinkable if you make everything nice and have some sides.", "> I don\u2019t understand how people don\u2019t know not to show up empty handed even if you\u2019re just going for a short visit\n\nBecause there's nothing to know.  This is just your personal (and extreme) way of looking at things, not a set of rules that you can expect strangers to follow.", "This isn\u2019t true for everyone everywhere. I don\u2019t expect anyone to bring things to my gatherings and vice versa.", "Yep. Chips and soda are also a good pick if you aren\u2019t comfortable bringing alcohol, or sparkling water (I have a sober friend who always brings la croix). If I know my GF friend is coming over I try and get GF snacks for her because I know my other friends will bring regular chips and snacks.\n\nFor alcohol, you can just ask your friend group what they all like drinking and bring a pack of that. My friends are usually fine with something like Mike\u2019s Hard. Being friends is all about the give and take, imo. You can\u2019t just take and still be a good friend.", "Typical lobster behaviour!", "Not sure, I'm Australian but a few Aussies have responded and said it's a thing here.", "I guess I was thinking just strictly pizza and assuming basic pepperoni since that\u2019s what I make a lot. Typically a dough recipe is enough for two pizzas, and that\u2019s like 4 cups of flour, a little salt, a little yeast, a little sugar, a little olive oil, and some water. If you already bake/cook you probably already have these things on hand. So maybe he doubled it and needed to buy more flour or something?\n\nI dunno I just think that\u2019s a lot for homemade pizza unless they got fancy toppings, which seems to have not been OPs choice. Something\u2019s weird here to me. \n\nMaybe they did just buy extras ig", "It's *definitely* the top end of what you could spend to make some really good pizza and then some, just not unthinkable. I will say this, at that point I'd sooner just buy 6 ~$15 steaks and some asparagus and potatoes for sides than make a bougie pizza."]}
