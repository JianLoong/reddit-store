He was like 'hey, can you send me $18 for the pizza' \n\nTo which I responded 'when did we order pizza?'.\nJohn responds with 'The pizzas I cooked at boardgames night'\n\nNow to preface this 1. He offered to make pizza and host boardgames, which he decided to do on his own accord and 2. Did not ask anyone for money for doing so beforehand or say it would cost $$.\n\nSo with a bit of conversation back at forth (since I've never had anyone ask me for money for a home cooked meal)... he said he was asking for money since I asked him for money for fish and chips.\nNow the fish and chips were not home cooked and it has ALWAYS been the case that we pay for ourselves at a restaurant or fast food/take out. And I would expect to give him money if it was the other way round.\n\nI mentioned this to him and he said he sees it differently quote \"a meal for a meal\".\n\nI then asked if he has requested $18 off any of our other friends. Which he said no.\n\nSo I said 'this is unfair and he's changing how we usually handle these sort of situations and specifically targeting me for some reason...\n\nAnd he said it was because the other friends will bring drinks and smokes etc and share it with him, which I do not.\n\nTo which I responded, 'well I don't drink or smoke' and also I've NEVER charged you for a home cooked meal.'\n\nThen some angry messages were sent my way and we have not spoken.\n\nI can send him $18, it's not about the money... It's just how he has handled the situation, is singling me out, and especially charging me after the fact (which has never happened before and is not normal behavior).\n\nAITA for not giving my friend $18 for a home cooked pizza?", "created_utc": 1703778202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18swuee/aita_for_not_repaying_my_friend_18_for_a_pizza/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wants to get reimbursed for the Fish and Chips and is an idiot about it.", "NTA.\n\nCharging people for food you cook when you are hosting is incredibly rude.\n\nAlso, I have friends who don't drink or smoke.

He doesn't understand social norms I guess, that's no reason why you need to send him $18.\n\nIf he doesn't want to pay for hosting then he shouldn't host.\n\nThere's no way your portion of the pizza cost him $18 either.", "NTA. Must be great pizza for that price\u2026", "NTA for the main part, he handles it incorrectly\u2026\n\nbut slight YTA for turning up to peoples places with no drink or snack, it\u2019s rude!", "NTA - Send him a bill for all the home cooked meals you have provided him and at the bottom minus $18 (PIZZA).\n\nSend it to him with a polite note 'payment is now due'.\n\nAnd never speak to him again.

That seems insane to me!\n\nMaybe if it were a big expensive meal and I asked them all beforehand if they'd chip in and I would cook and host them?

Your friend is being weirdly petty.", "NTA.  Volunteering a home cooked meal and then charging $18? Thats insanity", "Turning up empty handed when others don\u2019t is a no no and a bit of an AH move. Could be why he\u2019s really asking, because you turn up empty handed often. \n\nHe\u2019s gone about it in the wrong way and is being a bit of an asshole about it.

It's less about $18 and more about you being an active contributor to group events.\n\nApologize, send him the money, and tell him from here on out you'll volunteer to bring something to share.", "For future reference, most people bring something as a host gift when they eat or drink at someone's house.
