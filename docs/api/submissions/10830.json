Tasha has a lot of mental health issues and has trouble leaving our apartment for appointments, so she does online therapy appointments. We live in a one room studio, so because of doctor-patient confidentiality, I have to leave the apartment whenever she\u2019s doing her appointments. \n\nThe main problem is Tasha won\u2019t tell me about these appointments until 10 or so minutes before they start. I\u2019ll just be doing something random, and then she\u2019ll turn to me and go \u201coh, by the way, I have therapy in 10 minutes\u201d and I\u2019ll have to get all my stuff and go somewhere on that short of notice. She has ADHD and can be really forgetful, so I understand it on some level, but it\u2019s pretty inconvenient. The appointments aren\u2019t on a consistent/set schedule, so it\u2019s not like I can predict when they\u2019re going to happen and plan ahead either. This has happened 5+ times. \n\nThe last time this happened, which was about 2 weeks ago, I sat Tasha down and explained that she needs to give me at LEAST 24 hours notice before her appointments so I can plan ahead. I said that it\u2019s very inconvenient to have to pack up all my stuff and get out within 10 minutes, especially when I\u2019m in the middle of an assignment or something. I warned her that if it happened again, I wouldn\u2019t be leaving and she\u2019d have to find somewhere else to have her appointment. She apologized and said she\u2019d set alarms so she remembered, and I thought that was the end of it. \n\nBut lo and behold, it happened again this morning. Tasha told me she had therapy in 10 minutes and she forgot to set the alarms. I told her that, per our talk 2 weeks ago, I wouldn\u2019t be leaving the room. She started arguing with me and said it was \u201cjust this once\u201d and it wouldn\u2019t kill me to go to a cafe or something for a couple hours. I was working on an assignment, and I can\u2019t really concentrate anywhere but the apartment, so I still refused to leave. Eventually, she just took her laptop and stomped out of the apartment to try and find a place. But 20 minutes later, she came back and blew up at me saying that she couldn\u2019t find a private place to have her appointment, so she had to cancel it. And because she canceled on such short notice, she wouldn\u2019t get her money back. She yelled at me saying I wasn\u2019t being understanding of her ADHD and it wasn\u2019t her fault she was forgetful, and I was being petty and ableist over nothing. I reminded her that I warned her this would happen, but she wasn\u2019t having it and has now refused to speak to me for hours. So I just thought I\u2019d come here and get more opinions on if I was TA.", "created_utc": 1677279370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11b4q5e/aita_for_refusing_to_leave_the_room_during_my/", "score": 372, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's very good that you understand where it's coming from but in the end you can't be expected to pack up and leave on a few minutes notice. How about putting up a calendar where she marks her therapy dates and times so you can properly give her the privacy she needs doe those? It would be advantageous to both of you.", "NTA. I have ADHD and during Covid when I needed to meet my therapist from home when I created the appointment in my calendar and invited my boyfriend to the event so it showed up in his calendar, too. It can be hard to remember but she needs to think about systems she can put in place so she doesn\u2019t need to remember. It doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s a byproduct of her ADHD or just run of the mill forgetfulness - it\u2019s still not fair to you. \n\nIt\u2019s also not like you sprung this on her. You spoke to her about it last time it happened and let her know your expectations, which she agreed to.", "NTA not at all. You gave her plenty of warning.  She'd had time to write it on a calendar or something.  Plus...it should be her responsibility to find someplace private.  Do either of you have a car to sit in? Or go sit in the bathroom with the door closed. Put on headphones and/or use closed captions and type responses to her therapist.  Either way..finding privacy for her therapy sessions is HER responsibility.  Not yours. This is something her therapist should address with her, being responsible for herself.", "Nta.

It would take very little effort for her to text you right when she makes her next appointment with the date and time.

We have to develop coping strategies to be functional adults, and that is on her. In education we talk about logical and natural consequences. The natural consequence is what happens without any intervention. If she doesn't tell you in advance, the natural consequence is that you don't know. The logical consequence is what logically follows. The logical consequence here is that you do not plan to be out of the home. Those are clear consequences of her own actions, and they are hers to manage. You have been awesome about leaving to give her privacy. If she wants that to continue, she has to give you notice.", "NTA\n\nYou gave her very fair warning and she has a responsibility to manage her affairs better than this, ADHD or not.

She can\u2019t keep blaming her ADHD and needs to make attempts at solutions.", "NTA, as someone with ADHD. \n\nShe knows there's a problem and there are plenty of ways she can address it/mitigate the ADHD-ness (shared google calendar, writing on a wall calendar, texting you as soon as she gets the appointment through, setting multiple alarms). She's not done that, despite it impacting you - and yes, having a brain that works differently is hard work, but she's now choosing not to use tools to help her manage her symptoms which is rude. \n\nMy old housemate had Tourette's with motor tics that often including punching. He couldn't help it (like your housemate can't help having ADHD) but if he felt tic attacks coming on he would make sure he wasn't in arm reaching distance of us because it was ultimately on him to make the decision not to impact the people around him.\n\nSame thing here. There are countless tools available to help people with poor memories remember things and countless tools for scheduling time slots between family/friends, she's choosing not to use them.", "NTA.

If she forgets again couldn\u2019t you use noises cancelling headphones?", "NTA\n\nI was going to recommend talking to her or having her tell you her schedule to avoid this but.. you\u2019ve tried everything. \n\nYou put a line and explained your boundaries. I hope you get everything figured out, but she needs to understand that it\u2019s your space too. I understand that she has therapy and she\u2019s trying to work on herself, but you\u2019ve had a conversation with her about it and she promised to do something about.\n\nJust talk to her again when she calms down and tried to turn the tables; Ask her how she would feel if you did that to her.

You are already accommodating her by offering to clear out IF given adequate notice.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been very accommodating given the close living quarters and your request for 24 hours notice is extremely reasonable. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s scheduling these appointments days if not weeks in advance, why can she not text you a heads-up when she makes her next appt? \n\nYou should just enforce your warning that if she doesn\u2019t give you 24 hours notice that it\u2019s up to her to find a private place to conduct her appointment.", "NTA. ADHD shouldn\u2019t be a crutch to fall back on every time she makes a mistake, she\u2019s 20, it\u2019s time to learn that. What you asked for isn\u2019t unreasonable and literally any phone calendar allows you to set reminders a day ahead of time OR invite a friend to the event. She can find a way that works to notify you if the appointments. This isn\u2019t a big ask on your part but asking you to leave with zero notice is incredibly inconvenient.", "NTA. Just because you have ADHD doesn\u2019t mean you can forget your manners and inconvenience other people.

She seems unreasonable, dramatic, and petty, and it won\u2019t get any better for you if she continues to act like that.", "Well maybe she should take this as a lesson learned and be more responsible/considerate of other people. NTA. Had you known and still refused that would be different but you set a very reasonable boundary and she once again chose to ignore it or make any attempts.", "NTA.", "NTA.
