Tasha has a lot of mental health issues and has trouble leaving our apartment for appointments, so she does online therapy appointments. We live in a one room studio, so because of doctor-patient confidentiality, I have to leave the apartment whenever she\u2019s doing her appointments. \n\nThe main problem is Tasha won\u2019t tell me about these appointments until 10 or so minutes before they start. I\u2019ll just be doing something random, and then she\u2019ll turn to me and go \u201coh, by the way, I have therapy in 10 minutes\u201d and I\u2019ll have to get all my stuff and go somewhere on that short of notice. She has ADHD and can be really forgetful, so I understand it on some level, but it\u2019s pretty inconvenient. The appointments aren\u2019t on a consistent/set schedule, so it\u2019s not like I can predict when they\u2019re going to happen and plan ahead either. This has happened 5+ times. \n\nThe last time this happened, which was about 2 weeks ago, I sat Tasha down and explained that she needs to give me at LEAST 24 hours notice before her appointments so I can plan ahead. I said that it\u2019s very inconvenient to have to pack up all my stuff and get out within 10 minutes, especially when I\u2019m in the middle of an assignment or something. I warned her that if it happened again, I wouldn\u2019t be leaving and she\u2019d have to find somewhere else to have her appointment. She apologized and said she\u2019d set alarms so she remembered, and I thought that was the end of it. \n\nBut lo and behold, it happened again this morning. Tasha told me she had therapy in 10 minutes and she forgot to set the alarms. I told her that, per our talk 2 weeks ago, I wouldn\u2019t be leaving the room. She started arguing with me and said it was \u201cjust this once\u201d and it wouldn\u2019t kill me to go to a cafe or something for a couple hours. I was working on an assignment, and I can\u2019t really concentrate anywhere but the apartment, so I still refused to leave. Eventually, she just took her laptop and stomped out of the apartment to try and find a place. But 20 minutes later, she came back and blew up at me saying that she couldn\u2019t find a private place to have her appointment, so she had to cancel it. And because she canceled on such short notice, she wouldn\u2019t get her money back. She yelled at me saying I wasn\u2019t being understanding of her ADHD and it wasn\u2019t her fault she was forgetful, and I was being petty and ableist over nothing. I reminded her that I warned her this would happen, but she wasn\u2019t having it and has now refused to speak to me for hours. So I just thought I\u2019d come here and get more opinions on if I was TA.", "created_utc": 1677279370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11b4q5e/aita_for_refusing_to_leave_the_room_during_my/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's very good that you understand where it's coming from but in the end you can't be expected to pack up and leave on a few minutes notice. How about putting up a calendar where she marks her therapy dates and times so you can properly give her the privacy she needs doe those? It would be advantageous to both of you.", "NTA. I have ADHD and during Covid when I needed to meet my therapist from home when I created the appointment in my calendar and invited my boyfriend to the event so it showed up in his calendar, too. It can be hard to remember but she needs to think about systems she can put in place so she doesn\u2019t need to remember. It doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s a byproduct of her ADHD or just run of the mill forgetfulness - it\u2019s still not fair to you. \n\nIt\u2019s also not like you sprung this on her. You spoke to her about it last time it happened and let her know your expectations, which she agreed to.", "NTA not at all. You gave her plenty of warning.  She'd had time to write it on a calendar or something.  Plus...it should be her responsibility to find someplace private.  Do either of you have a car to sit in?

We have to develop coping strategies to be functional adults, and that is on her. In education we talk about logical and natural consequences. The natural consequence is what happens without any intervention. If she doesn't tell you in advance, the natural consequence is that you don't know. The logical consequence is what logically follows. The logical consequence here is that you do not plan to be out of the home. Those are clear consequences of her own actions, and they are hers to manage. You have been awesome about leaving to give her privacy. If she wants that to continue, she has to give you notice.", "NTA\n\nYou gave her very fair warning and she has a responsibility to manage her affairs better than this, ADHD or not.

She can\u2019t keep blaming her ADHD and needs to make attempts at solutions.", "NTA, as someone with ADHD. \n\nShe knows there's a problem and there are plenty of ways she can address it/mitigate the ADHD-ness (shared google calendar, writing on a wall calendar, texting you as soon as she gets the appointment through, setting multiple alarms). She's not done that, despite it impacting you - and yes, having a brain that works differently is hard work, but she's now choosing not to use tools to help her manage her symptoms which is rude. \n\nMy old housemate had Tourette's with motor tics that often including punching. He couldn't help it (like your housemate can't help having ADHD) but if he felt tic attacks coming on he would make sure he wasn't in arm reaching distance of us because it was ultimately on him to make the decision not to impact the people around him.\n\nSame thing here. There are countless tools available to help people with poor memories remember things and countless tools for scheduling time slots between family/friends, she's choosing not to use them.", "NTA.

I understand that she has therapy and she\u2019s trying to work on herself, but you\u2019ve had a conversation with her about it and she promised to do something about.\n\nJust talk to her again when she calms down and tried to turn the tables; Ask her how she would feel if you did that to her.

You are already accommodating her by offering to clear out IF given adequate notice.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been very accommodating given the close living quarters and your request for 24 hours notice is extremely reasonable. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s scheduling these appointments days if not weeks in advance, why can she not text you a heads-up when she makes her next appt? \n\nYou should just enforce your warning that if she doesn\u2019t give you 24 hours notice that it\u2019s up to her to find a private place to conduct her appointment.", "NTA. ADHD shouldn\u2019t be a crutch to fall back on every time she makes a mistake, she\u2019s 20, it\u2019s time to learn that. What you asked for isn\u2019t unreasonable and literally any phone calendar allows you to set reminders a day ahead of time OR invite a friend to the event. She can find a way that works to notify you if the appointments. This isn\u2019t a big ask on your part but asking you to leave with zero notice is incredibly inconvenient.", "NTA. Just because you have ADHD doesn\u2019t mean you can forget your manners and inconvenience other people.

If someone is involved in the appointment with me,  I invite them to the calendar reminders. This is what your roommate should be doing. I am also a counselor.  I am curious about how your roommate's counselor is helping her manage her ADHD since the roommate  doesn't seem to have been learning any strategies. There are a lot of resources on the CHADD website and on other online ADHD forums. Perhaps you could share this info with you roommate.", "NTA my therapist sends me an automated email reminder the day before, which gets added to my Google calendar and then my partner can see that he needs to let me use the office during that time. This system involves like three clicks of work on my end", "NTA. Girl find another roommate. Her being neurodivergence is not excuse for lack of planning. She knows of appointments 4-5 days in advance if not the same day after the appointment ends.", "NTA- buy her a calendar ( paper) tell her to write them down when she makes the appointment. If she does this you know when you need to leave. If she doesn\u2019t, then you don\u2019t leave. You have the right to be in your space as well. I think you are very patient to put up with this.", "Noise cancelling headphones if she can\u2019t give you warning. NTA", "Maybe with some consequences it will help her remember?", "NTA. If she is so forgetful, then she should email or text you the next scheduled appointment she has as she makes it, so that you have it as she's thinking about it. There. Done. Solved. Or create a shared calendar for important roommate events. Or a Google doc with FYI notes for you both.\n\nThere is no excuse for her being so helpless when she can live/pay rent with a roommate that isn't her caregiver. \n\nYou also pay rent and have just as much of a right to be there as she does.", "She should be posting it to a shared calendar the minute it's scheduled so they both are reminded.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n> it wasn\u2019t her fault she was forgetful\n\nHaving ADHD means some things are going to be harder and require a different approach.\n\nWhat is NOT okay is her expecting you to absorb the consequences of her ADHD - that you would be expected to leave the apartment at the drop of a hat.\n\nAn emergency session is one thing - but something that has been scheduled in advance is different.\n\nShe needs to email you when she sets up the appointment.\n\nWrite her appointment times on the fridge (dry erase markers work great) \n\nSOMETHING.\n\nYou not wanting to have your life and schedule blown up by her isn\u2019t ableist. What she is demanding isn\u2019t accommodation. \n\nThe other option would be for her to find a living situation where she has her own room.\n\nAnd who the hell has a therapy session that\u2019s a couple of hours long?\n\nFrankly it sounds like she also is using this as an excuse to get the apartment alone.\n\nETA:\n> so because of doctor-patient confidentiality, I have to leave the apartment whenever she\u2019s doing her appointments.\n\nDoctor-patient confidentiality means the DOCTOR can\u2019t share private information. \n\nIt\u2019s fair for your roommate to want to keep her therapy sessions private though.", "No, NTA. It's unreasonable for her to continously expect you to leave while you're in the middle of your studies or whatever you'redoing at the time. She's the AH for expecting you to do so. It's your place, too. When she forgets to let you know she has an appointment, then that time she has left until the appointment, should be the amount of time she finds somewhere else for her to go have it. Having ADHD doesn't give her a pass for being inconsiderate. When I make appointments I write them down on a calendar, and confirm everything I've written before I even hang up the phone. It's a simple task that your roommate can do, too.", "NTA. And who goes to therapy for \"a couple HOURS\" ?!?!?!??!\n\nShe can go into the bathroom for her private appointment.\n\nShe can focus on being respectful of others time and priorities in therapy by start with remembering to tell you.\n\nShe can schedule in person appointments to focus on her own health and well being.\n\nShe can stop using her diagnosis as a way to guilt you into surrendering your boundaries.", "I have many disabilities including ADHD and I see that you HAVE been understanding and accommodating. But one thing she should be learning through therapy is not blaming everyone else. Sure, accommodations and understanding and empathy from others is important, BUT, WE CANNOT ENCROACH ON OTHER PEOPLE'S BOUNDARIES PERIOD!!! As SOON as she has an appointment, she needs to put in on a calendar you can check. If she forgets to, maybe ask her once a month or week, depending on how often her appointments are, when her appointment is for that week/month. NTA OP", "NTA. I have ADHD and I\u2019m incredibly forgetful ( l had a period of where I would leave my keys in the door lock a couple times a week). I once had a mentor tell me that having ADHD isn\u2019t my fault, but it\u2019s my responsibility to be accountable for my actions regardless of it.  So she needs to own up and accept it\u2019s her fault she had to cancel last minute because she failed to give adequate notice. She could seriously send you a text as soon as she makes her next appointment time as a reminder. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure there are calendar systems where it\u2019s share with authorized users, she could upload appointments as she makes them. Pretty sure Google has one.", "Nta\n\nI have adhd i would neve try to push the blame into others like this!", "NTA Her ADHD doesn't make her wants more important than yours. You have NO onus to leave at all so her expecting you to do it at a moments notice is taking advantage of you being kindhearted. You are also not held by any doctor-patient confidentiality. Da fuq? That has zero zip nada to do with you.", "NTA, but move!", "NTA \n\nI would have never agreed to leave my apartment in the first place", "NTA. You can't just tell your roommate they need to leave your shared room in ten minutes. She is being unreasonable. Do you not even have bedrooms? How does that work?", "NTA\n\nVery sorry she is having such a time being organized, but it is her issue, and one she needs to learn to cope with for all of her life.\n\nYou\u2019ve been accommodating when you could be, and couldn\u2019t be this time. Not your issue, it is hers. And there\u2019s nothing \u201cableist\u201d about that - getting really tired of how freely and completely inappropriately that is thrown about as of late, myself.", "NTA - Quick question, how does she remember at 10 minutes before about her appointment but not hours or days before? I get an automated text from my therapist 24 hours ahead reminding me about my appointment and letting me know to cancel if I won\u2019t be available at our scheduled time.", "Absolutely NTA.

NTA in any way shape or form.", "NTA.\n\nI have ADHD and my therapist has started sending me texts 10min before our appointments because I often forget (she automated this). I get it. But you know who doesn't forget I have an appointment? Everyone I share my google calendar with. I just put my appointments on my calendar, so everyone knows I am busy during that time and they should not bother me or try to schedule a meeting with me in that time slot. \n\nY'all need a shared calendar. Or something. She's an adult, she can figure out coping mechanisms for her ADHD.

Doctor-patient confidentiality is so the DOCTOR can't disclose it. A therapist wouldn't care about a third party there as it doesn't affect them if someone else hears your problems.\n\nI do get she might not want her roommate hearing, but it's also on her to give advanced notice.", "I\u2019m pretty sure her actual therapy only lasts around 45 minutes to an hour, but she told me she often gets emotional during the sessions and needs another hour to calm down.
