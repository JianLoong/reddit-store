The first issue is that your older sister betrayed your love, trust, and attempts to help her, as well as stealing your money. The second issue is that your family didn't seem to recognize it as the betrayal it was.\n\nIt would be very hard for me to be around someone who betrayed me like that.\n\nMaybe explain it to them in a way that maybe can help them understand your point of view. Like that the reason you can't be around your older sister is because what she did actually broke your heart, and it still stings.", "NTA 100%. \n\nYour older sister drained you emotionally and financially, and your family just expected you to brush it off?! I\u2019m surprised you still talk to any of them honestly.", "Nta- you should have pressed charges tho.", "NAH out of you and Jenny, which is what I think your question is asking. My heart breaks for you both in this scenario.\n\nBecca and your dad are AHs. \n\nYou need to reassure Jenny that you are proud of her and really want to share this day with her, but that you simply can\u2019t put yourself through being near Becca after what she did. Perhaps you can take Jenny out for dinner to celebrate her graduation instead.", "NTA\n\nA friend of mine has a very similar situation. His little brother robbed him and left, and even caused him a serious debt. He refuses to be in the same room as his little brother (I think he would not be able to restrain himself), but the family haven't turned their back on him so it's my friend that ends up suffering.\n\nIt's natural to expect your family to take the same stand you have, considering that there's no way to forgive being betrayed like that. But... this is how it usually works out.\n\nYou can either turn up to the graduation and deal with your sister being there, or you can miss out on family events. It's your right and you're NTA whichever way you decide.", "NTA\n\nIf what you said on the last sentence is true and that they prefer your thief sister to go over you then there you have it. Why would you feel bad not going? \n\nYou should consider to place any grudge aside and attend if your younger sister wants all of you to attend. Since this is about for younger sister graduating not about your older sister or your dad. It's not about what happened between your older sister and you.\n\nSo the question will be do you value your experience with your younger sister or do you value this grudge more.", "INFO: what's stronger? Your love for Jenny?  Or your hatred for Becca?  If you skip the graduation, you are sending a loud message that your hatred and anger for Becca is greater than any love you have for Jenny or other members in your family.  Is that the message you want to send?", "I think NTA just because I also wouldn't go over this. It's fine if Jenny and your Dad want Becca there, but they need to accept that they can't have both of you there.", "YWBTA imo  \n\n\nIf you want to burn all bridges with your family, don't go. Shitty what your sister did for sure, but to me, you could put your issues aside for one night to show your younger sister that you are there for her. Go, sit on the other side of the venue. Afterwards find her and tell her you're proud of her, then leave. Her graduation isn't about you and what went on with the older sister. It's a huge accomplishment that should be celebrated, not ruined with family drama.   \n\n\nBut that's just my opinion on the matter.", "I'm wavering between N T A but going with ESH.\n\nYou had the opportunity to be made whole. You refused it. Your father did what most parents do-- he tried to protect all of his children. I can't blame him for that. One incident is rarely enough for a parent to cut off a child, it usually takes a consistent pattern of behavior like that. \n\nJenny is young and likely doesn't really understand the gravity of what Becca did to you here, how badly you were taken advantage of. If she was closer to Becca in the first place, she would naturally be biased in her favor as well.\n\nDon't get me wrong, you're in a shitty situation. I wouldn't blame you if you decided that you don't want to see any of them anymore. But I think that if you want to maintain a relationship with Dad and Jenny, you have to go. Punishing them for still loving your sister isn't going to do you any favors, it will just serve to ruin your sister's graduation.\n\nSide note: when you say \"comes to me when she needs something,\" what does that mean? I assumed that means you two are close, but you said she likes Becca better?", "NTA. Becca used you for everything she could get and when you told her to leave the thank you she gives is to steal from you. It sounds Jenny has started the trend of using you also especially if the only time she gets in contact with you is because she needs something. I am confused about why you want to be around dad (the enabler) and the two sisters who are users.I can see why you stated that Jenny and Becca are close based off the description you provided.", "This was tough but...YWBTA if you don't go. Your older sister is an awful person, your dad enabled what happened, and your younger sister hasn't even denounced the theif sisters behavior...they all don't sound that great. But you said yourself that this is a significant milestone for your younger sister, and I agree. You can sit somewhere away from your family, find your sister after the ceremony, and congratulate her. Maybe even do something with just the 2 of you later.", "Unpopular opinion, but I think you\u2019d be TA (a little bit). I understand what Becca did is horrible, but this is about showing up for your younger sister. \n\nI think you should go, you don\u2019t have to interact with Becca. If you choose to put your problems with your older sister over Jenny, that will most definitely complicate your relationship with her.\n\n(Also, I\u2019m not sure if you expect/ want your dad and sister to cut off Becca, but that\u2019s not reasonable. It takes more than a couple of isolated incidents to cut off family!)", "ESH: While I understand a parent wanting to help their child that's in trouble... prefering one child over another isn't right.\n\nBut at the same time, if you skip out on your sister's graduation, you're hurting her, not your family.  It's sort of a \"why let them win\".  Just because you're in the same stadium as them don't mean you have to interact with them.\n\nDon't let them and their actions come between you and your younger sister.", "YWBTA\n\nSit on the other side of the stadium, as you mentioned. You don't have to talk to her, or even look at her, just be there for your younger sister. You say in this post that you were really looking forward to seeing your younger sister graduate. You shouldn't have to miss out on that opportunity because of your older sister.", "Yta. Graduation ceremonies are huge. There is no reason you can't attend separately", "YTA. \n\nThis is a once in a lifetime celebration that you would miss because of an issue you have with someone else. You have put your sister into an impossible situation. You\u2019re asking her to choose between family members who haven\u2019t harmed her. \n\nThis day isn\u2019t about you. Suck it up and celebrate with your younger sister.", "YTA. It\u2019s totally understandable that you don\u2019t want to see her. But the way that you\u2019re framing it as them preferring her over you makes you the ahole. It\u2019s your conflict, not theirs. Your sister definitely has some problems but that doesn\u2019t mean the family has to abandon her.", "YTA. They don't prefer your sister over you. They seem to have forgiven her for stealing from you, but would probably do the same for you if you had been the thief. Out of love for your graduating sister you should attend the ceremony.  To give you some perspective, my ex-husband-the father of my children, had me arrested after his gf started a fight with me when I dropped our children off at his apartment and later caused an unfounded CPS case to be opened against me. I spent two nights in jail. I've never NOT attended something for our children because he was going to be there.", "YWBTA.\n\nYou are punishing those around you for something someone else did.", "NTA. However, you might be in a damn if you do, damn if you don't situation. If you don't go, the focus will be, \"Hey where is...\" if you do go and there is so much tension between you and Becca the question/focus will be, \"What's the deal between you and Becca?'", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And you could always bring a list of all that she owes you and hand it to her when leaving. Um...what are the statues of limitation for her crime? lol.\n\nNTA", "Agreed. If she does have to see Becca she can just refuse to acknowledge her and if Becca tries to talk to her say:\nDad and Jenny may be OK with you but I know what you are. I gave you a place to live and you betrayed me by stealing from me. The only reason I didn\u2019t call the police on you is because Dad begged me not to. Don\u2019t ever speak to me again unless it\u2019s an apology with full restitution. I\u2019m here for Jenny, I want nothing to do with you.", "Agree", "Why should she support a sister that won\u2019t support her?", "Because making your conflict with someone other peoples' problem is a shitty thing to do.  There's no need to throw a high school kid into the middle of drama between two adults.", "OP is pretty much being neglected by their family, so why should she support a family that won\u2019t support her?\n\nHer dad convinced her to not file a police report, then did nothing. The rest of her family also did nothing. Her family *is* neglecting her.", "Her dad paid back all the money.  Asking for his daughter not to be given legal trouble doesn't mean he's not supporting the other one.  If you ask me, it's pretty weird to get hung up on filing a police report when you've already been compensated.  That, and everything else in this post reads to me like OP has a weird fixation on wanting to punish people.\n\nThere's a lot of talk about abandonment and lack of support when that's precisely what she's doing to her younger sister who's innocent in all this.\n\nThe older sister definitely sucks.  But demanding the rest of the family shun her from and important day in the younger sister's life, and to not even be able to be in the same *stadium* as her, is simply immature and petty as hell.", "He offered to pay back, but she didn\u2019t accept. Because the money did nothing to the emotional damage caused by her older sister.\n\nWhat it looks like she wants is some support emotionally for what happened. But she got nothing from her family. And this includes her younger sister (who is an adult), who watched it all happen and did nothing.\n\nThe rest of the family shouldn\u2019t shun the older sister, but they should\u2019ve done something. *Anything*. So again, why should she support a family that doesn\u2019t support her?", "OP did not take the money because it wasn\u2019t about that. I do agree that they should go to say they were there but no need to interact with anyone. Dad sounds like he wants to make this a big reunion and sweep it all under the rug", "I guess I'm just a completely different type of person to the point where I'm not even capable of seeing it that way.\n\nThis all feels so petty and spiteful.  The sister is a literal thief and somehow she comes off as less obnoxious in all this to me.", "Jenny was 16 when the theft happened. I feel it\u2019s pretty tough to expect her to choose between her sisters - even if it seems cut and dried to an outsider - especially when it sounds like the mum isn\u2019t in the picture."]}
