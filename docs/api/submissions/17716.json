It's no secret that she comes to me if she needs something, and I guess part of me thought she would grow out of it. \n\n2 years ago, my older sister Becca (28F) was out of work and stayed with me for 6 months while she got on her feet. I bought her clothes, stocked the house with essentials and food, and paid whenever we went out together. After several more months of excuses on why she couldn't find a job, I told her it was time for her to move. A few days after our conversation, she stole $1000 I kept hidden in my closet, and left. \n\nMy dad convinced me not to file a police report and offered to pay back what she took. I told him I didnt understand why he was cleaning up after her and he said he didnt want to see his kids fight, and if it was about the money, then he would pay me so I could move on. I didn't take his money and stopped talking to him for a few months.\n\nJenny has always had a stronger relationship with Becca, and never officially denounced what Becca did. \n\nDad and I have talked here and there the last few  months, and he invited me to Jenny's graduation. He really wants me to go and sounds excited. While talking about the time and place, he mentioned that Becca would be there.

The first issue is that your older sister betrayed your love, trust, and attempts to help her, as well as stealing your money. The second issue is that your family didn't seem to recognize it as the betrayal it was.\n\nIt would be very hard for me to be around someone who betrayed me like that.\n\nMaybe explain it to them in a way that maybe can help them understand your point of view. Like that the reason you can't be around your older sister is because what she did actually broke your heart, and it still stings.", "NTA 100%. \n\nYour older sister drained you emotionally and financially, and your family just expected you to brush it off?! I\u2019m surprised you still talk to any of them honestly.", "Nta- you should have pressed charges tho.", "NAH out of you and Jenny, which is what I think your question is asking. My heart breaks for you both in this scenario.\n\nBecca and your dad are AHs. \n\nYou need to reassure Jenny that you are proud of her and really want to share this day with her, but that you simply can\u2019t put yourself through being near Becca after what she did. Perhaps you can take Jenny out for dinner to celebrate her graduation instead.", "NTA\n\nA friend of mine has a very similar situation. His little brother robbed him and left, and even caused him a serious debt. He refuses to be in the same room as his little brother (I think he would not be able to restrain himself), but the family haven't turned their back on him so it's my friend that ends up suffering.\n\nIt's natural to expect your family to take the same stand you have, considering that there's no way to forgive being betrayed like that. But... this is how it usually works out.\n\nYou can either turn up to the graduation and deal with your sister being there, or you can miss out on family events. It's your right and you're NTA whichever way you decide.", "NTA\n\nIf what you said on the last sentence is true and that they prefer your thief sister to go over you then there you have it. Why would you feel bad not going? \n\nYou should consider to place any grudge aside and attend if your younger sister wants all of you to attend. Since this is about for younger sister graduating not about your older sister or your dad. It's not about what happened between your older sister and you.\n\nSo the question will be do you value your experience with your younger sister or do you value this grudge more.", "INFO: what's stronger? Your love for Jenny?  Or your hatred for Becca?  If you skip the graduation, you are sending a loud message that your hatred and anger for Becca is greater than any love you have for Jenny or other members in your family.  Is that the message you want to send?", "I think NTA just because I also wouldn't go over this. It's fine if Jenny and your Dad want Becca there, but they need to accept that they can't have both of you there.", "YWBTA imo  \n\n\nIf you want to burn all bridges with your family, don't go. Shitty what your sister did for sure, but to me, you could put your issues aside for one night to show your younger sister that you are there for her. Go, sit on the other side of the venue. Afterwards find her and tell her you're proud of her, then leave. Her graduation isn't about you and what went on with the older sister. It's a huge accomplishment that should be celebrated, not ruined with family drama.   \n\n\nBut that's just my opinion on the matter.", "I'm wavering between N T A but going with ESH.\n\nYou had the opportunity to be made whole. You refused it. Your father did what most parents do-- he tried to protect all of his children. I can't blame him for that. One incident is rarely enough for a parent to cut off a child, it usually takes a consistent pattern of behavior like that. \n\nJenny is young and likely doesn't really understand the gravity of what Becca did to you here, how badly you were taken advantage of. If she was closer to Becca in the first place, she would naturally be biased in her favor as well.\n\nDon't get me wrong, you're in a shitty situation. I wouldn't blame you if you decided that you don't want to see any of them anymore. But I think that if you want to maintain a relationship with Dad and Jenny, you have to go. Punishing them for still loving your sister isn't going to do you any favors, it will just serve to ruin your sister's graduation.\n\nSide note: when you say \"comes to me when she needs something,\" what does that mean? I assumed that means you two are close, but you said she likes Becca better?", "NTA. Becca used you for everything she could get and when you told her to leave the thank you she gives you is to steal from you. It sounds like Jenny has started the trend of using you also, especially if the only time she gets in contact with you is because she needs something. I am confused about why you want to be around dad (the enabler) and the two sisters who are users.I can see why you stated that Jenny and Becca are close based off the description you provided.", "This was tough but...YWBTA if you don't go. Your older sister is an awful person, your dad enabled what happened, and your younger sister hasn't even denounced the theif sisters behavior...they all don't sound that great. But you said yourself that this is a significant milestone for your younger sister, and I agree. You can sit somewhere away from your family, find your sister after the ceremony, and congratulate her. Maybe even do something with just the 2 of you later.", "Unpopular opinion, but I think you\u2019d be TA (a little bit). I understand what Becca did is horrible, but this is about showing up for your younger sister. \n\nI think you should go, you don\u2019t have to interact with Becca. If you choose to put your problems with your older sister over Jenny, that will most definitely complicate your relationship with her.\n\n(Also, I\u2019m not sure if you expect/ want your dad and sister to cut off Becca, but that\u2019s not reasonable. It takes more than a couple of isolated incidents to cut off family!)", "ESH: While I understand a parent wanting to help their child that's in trouble... prefering one child over another isn't right.\n\nBut at the same time, if you skip out on your sister's graduation, you're hurting her, not your family.  It's sort of a \"why let them win\".  Just because you're in the same stadium as them don't mean you have to interact with them.\n\nDon't let them and their actions come between you and your younger sister.", "YWBTA\n\nSit on the other side of the stadium, as you mentioned. You don't have to talk to her, or even look at her, just be there for your younger sister. You say in this post that you were really looking forward to seeing your younger sister graduate. You shouldn't have to miss out on that opportunity because of your older sister.", "Yta. Graduation ceremonies are huge. There is no reason you can't attend separately", "YTA. \n\nDo you love your younger sister more than you hate your older sister? \n\nThis is a once in a lifetime celebration that you would miss because of an issue you have with someone else. You have put your younger sister (who was 15-16 at the time of the incident) into an impossible situation. You\u2019re asking her to choose between family members who haven\u2019t harmed her. \n\nThis day isn\u2019t about you. Suck it up and celebrate with your younger sister.", "YTA. It\u2019s totally understandable that you don\u2019t want to see her. But the way that you\u2019re framing it as them preferring her over you makes you the ahole. It\u2019s your conflict, not theirs. Your sister definitely has some problems but that doesn\u2019t mean the family has to abandon her.", "YTA. They don't prefer your sister over you. They seem to have forgiven her for stealing from you, but would probably do the same for you if you had been the thief. Out of love for your graduating sister you should attend the ceremony.  To give you some perspective, my ex-husband-the father of my children, had me arrested after his gf started a fight with me when I dropped our children off at his apartment and later caused an unfounded CPS case to be opened against me. I spent two nights in jail. I've never NOT attended something for our children because he was going to be there.", "YWBTA.\n\nYou are punishing those around you for something someone else did.", "NTA. However, you might be in a damn if you do, damn if you don't situation. If you don't go, the focus will be, \"Hey where is...\" if you do go and there is so much tension between you and Becca the question/focus will be, \"What's the deal between you and Becca?'", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m here for Jenny, I want nothing to do with you.", "Agree", "Why should she support a sister that won\u2019t support her?", "Because making your conflict with someone other peoples' problem is a shitty thing to do.  There's no need to throw a high school kid into the middle of drama between two adults.", "OP is pretty much being neglected by their family, so why should she support a family that won\u2019t support her?\n\nHer dad convinced her to not file a police report, then did nothing. The rest of her family also did nothing. Her family *is* neglecting her.", "Her dad paid back all the money.  Asking for his daughter not to be given legal trouble doesn't mean he's not supporting the other one.  If you ask me, it's pretty weird to get hung up on filing a police report when you've already been compensated.  That, and everything else in this post reads to me like OP has a weird fixation on wanting to punish people.\n\nThere's a lot of talk about abandonment and lack of support when that's precisely what she's doing to her younger sister who's innocent in all this.\n\nThe older sister definitely sucks.  But demanding the rest of the family shun her from and important day in the younger sister's life, and to not even be able to be in the same *stadium* as her, is simply immature and petty as hell.", "He offered to pay back, but she didn\u2019t accept. Because the money did nothing to the emotional damage caused by her older sister.\n\nWhat it looks like she wants is some support emotionally for what happened. But she got nothing from her family. And this includes her younger sister (who is an adult), who watched it all happen and did nothing.\n\nThe rest of the family shouldn\u2019t shun the older sister, but they should\u2019ve done something. *Anything*.

The sister is a literal thief and somehow she comes off as less obnoxious in all this to me.", "Jenny was 16 when the theft happened.

His response was done out of love for his daughters. He wanted to make things right by you by giving you the money, but he also didn\u2019t want harm to come to her. Not to say that it was the right choice, but a choice I can see being made from a place of love.\n\nIt is understandable why you are still upset with your older sister, and wouldn\u2019t want to be around her. It also seems like you are holding onto resentment towards your younger sister for being in contact with the older. I know it can be frustrating to not have people understand your point of view, but you also cannot control others. It sounds like you would really benefit from some therapy to help you work through your family situation.\n\nTell your dad you still can\u2019t be around your older sister, but do something with your younger sister and possibly him to celebrate together.

Grow the fuck up and go be there for your sister. You dont have to communicate or acknowledge your other sister. It doesn't matter if your younger sister never publicly shamed her other sister for stealing from you. You being upset about that is dragging somebody else into a situation they have nothing to do with, dragging a child into a situation they have nothing to do with. You did the same with your dad. Your sister stole from you and you ran to tattle to daddy instead of calling the police to handle it. Of course he didn't want you to call the police and have his child arrested. I don't know if $1k still counts as petty theft or a felony, either way it'll follow her around. You're surprised that he tried to pay back the money she stole instead? You want somebody legally held accountable, don't go to their parents to figure out what to do next. Grow up and learn how to be civil with people you don't like in public situations.", "NTA.

You didn\u2019t speak with your dad because he tried to pay you back? That\u2019s just stupid. \n\nHe tried to clean up a mess that one of his daughters made, and clearly that daughter has some issues. I\u2019m not saying it was the best parenting move; I don\u2019t know how your dad\u2019s tried to help your sister non-financially and maybe he\u2019s just enabling her at this point, but for you to break contact with him?? That\u2019s silly. \n\nAnd to cause a rift with your younger sister because she \u201cnever officially denounced what Becca did\u201d? This isn\u2019t world politics, people do not regularly \u201cdenounce\u201d their family members. She probably feels trapped in the middle between two sisters she loves, both of whom are acting childishly. \n\nHold a grudge, fine. Your thieving sister screwed you over, no doubt, but to refuse to be within a square mile of her makes you sound deranged.

Everyone makes mistakes and everyone has done something bad before, unless it\u2019s a long-standing pattern of fucking everyone in the family over and being terrible to everyone (which doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s the case) then it\u2019s just ridiculous to burn bridges with everyone because they won\u2019t cut off and disown their child or sister.

Becca has taken too much from you already. Please don\u2019t let her take away your relationship with your younger sister. If you don\u2019t attend Jenny\u2019s graduation, it will hurt her which could quite possibly severely damage your relationship and become a significant obstacle to ever improving it. \n\nJenny is young and likely doesn\u2019t know what Becca is capable of in the same way that you do. She may need you to look out for her or at least be available to help pick up the pieces if/when Becca tries takes advantage of her like she did with you. That ought to be your father\u2019s role but he\u2019s obviously engaged in emotional thinking and doesn\u2019t see the situation clearly. \n\nMy advice would be to attend Jenny\u2019s graduation. Try to avoid your older sister but if it\u2019s not possible, go grey rock with her. Be civil but emotionless. Don\u2019t initiate conversation. Be polite but reply to questions with one word or flat boring answers. Give her nothing. Believe me, there can be a certain satisfaction in giving someone like her the grey rock treatment. Frustrates them no end when they can\u2019t get you to engage in their games. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should throw your whole family away, or at least not yet. You can still salvage your relationship with Jenny. Don\u2019t let Becca take anything more away from you.", "YWBTA.\n\nLet me explain. Specifically regarding the graduation, this isn't about you. It's about your younger sister. Ask yourself if you want to damage your relationship with your younger sister in order to avoid seeing your older sister. Think about it from your younger sister's point of view: You are a role model for her and someone she comes to when she is seeking advice for what to do. From your description, she very well views you as a mentor. It would be a huge disappointment for you not to be there, and it could potentially damage your relationship for a very long time.\n\nHOWEVER... What your older sister did was awful and abusive in a sense, and your dad knows the issue wasn't about \"the money.\" It was about opening your home and providing for someone while they get back on their feet only for them to take advantage of all of that AND to violate your home and safety by stealing from you. Your father is an enabler and should not be trusted. The way you feel about your older sister is justified.\n\nSo I guess I'd rather approach this from a different question: Is it more important to not see your older sister, or is it more important to support your younger sister at her graduation? Is this a moment you will regret in the future if you do not attend? Figure out your priorities and what you want your future relationships to look like, then go from there.\n\nGood luck.", "Don\u2019t be the AH. \n\nA few years ago, one of my sisters was repeatedly picking on me at family events. (We have a large family and many of us gather frequently for potluck meals and celebrations.) This sister struggled with addiction for 30 years, beat it at age 50, and has turned her life around since. The family tends to cut her extra slack because of this. \n\nI finally lost my cool - not sure why I was being targeted but we were always close and maybe she was jealous that my life struggles are different? Things got a bit messy. No one else would acknowledge her behaviour, except my husband had my back.  My solution was self preservation, without going NC. I passed on all small group invites if she was going to be there and I let everyone know that I just didn\u2019t feel safe in the same room with her, without lots of other people there. I saw her very occasionally but didn\u2019t speak except to maybe say hello and walk away.  I basically ignored her. This continued for about 2 years or so, then the tension started to ease. It\u2019s much improved now. Our relationship isn\u2019t the same - I won\u2019t put up with shite - but we have so much water under the bridge, it\u2019s not surprising some of it is turbulent. \n\nLife is long.

Why were you taking her out to do fun things? That's not a need in life, when you help someone who's down you only cover their needs. Why didn't you set a timeline for \"you need to have a job by X time or you will have to go somewhere else\"? You can't just let people continuously use you until you have nothing left to give and then get mad at them for taking something they probably thought you were giving freely.\n\nAnd your younger sister has nothing to do with this. It wasn't her fault and she shouldn't have to go scorched earth with one of her sisters because she and the other sister have issues that were probably also partially your fault. Go support your sister, this is about her, not you.

Right now she's probably thinking how easy it was to get away with stealing from OP, and planning on other ways to screw other people over. Eventually daddy isn't going to be able to protect her from the natural consequences of all of her actions, and that might be for a far worse crime. Better she learns now, on her first crime, than much later when she's in far greater trouble and won't be able to get it purged from her record down the road.", "Idk the dad, trying to pay off OP like it's just about the money tells me he probably didn't take this too seriously.
