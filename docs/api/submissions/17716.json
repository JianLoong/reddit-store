It's no secret that she comes to me if she needs something, and I guess part of me thought she would grow out of it. \n\n2 years ago, my older sister Becca (28F) was out of work and stayed with me for 6 months while she got on her feet. I bought her clothes, stocked the house with essentials and food, and paid whenever we went out together. After several more months of excuses on why she couldn't find a job, I told her it was time for her to move. A few days after our conversation, she stole $1000 I kept hidden in my closet, and left. \n\nMy dad convinced me not to file a police report and offered to pay back what she took. I told him I didnt understand why he was cleaning up after her and he said he didnt want to see his kids fight, and if it was about the money, then he would pay me so I could move on. I didn't take his money and stopped talking to him for a few months.\n\nJenny has always had a stronger relationship with Becca, and never officially denounced what Becca did. \n\nDad and I have talked here and there the last few  months, and he invited me to Jenny's graduation. He really wants me to go and sounds excited. While talking about the time and place, he mentioned that Becca would be there.

The first issue is that your older sister betrayed your love, trust, and attempts to help her, as well as stealing your money. The second issue is that your family didn't seem to recognize it as the betrayal it was.\n\nIt would be very hard for me to be around someone who betrayed me like that.\n\nMaybe explain it to them in a way that maybe can help them understand your point of view. Like that the reason you can't be around your older sister is because what she did actually broke your heart, and it still stings.", "NTA 100%. \n\nYour older sister drained you emotionally and financially, and your family just expected you to brush it off?! I\u2019m surprised you still talk to any of them honestly.", "Nta- you should have pressed charges tho.", "NAH out of you and Jenny, which is what I think your question is asking. My heart breaks for you both in this scenario.\n\nBecca and your dad are AHs. \n\nYou need to reassure Jenny that you are proud of her and really want to share this day with her, but that you simply can\u2019t put yourself through being near Becca after what she did. Perhaps you can take Jenny out for dinner to celebrate her graduation instead.", "NTA\n\nA friend of mine has a very similar situation. His little brother robbed him and left, and even caused him a serious debt. He refuses to be in the same room as his little brother (I think he would not be able to restrain himself), but the family haven't turned their back on him so it's my friend that ends up suffering.\n\nIt's natural to expect your family to take the same stand you have, considering that there's no way to forgive being betrayed like that. But... this is how it usually works out.\n\nYou can either turn up to the graduation and deal with your sister being there, or you can miss out on family events. It's your right and you're NTA whichever way you decide.", "NTA\n\nIf what you said on the last sentence is true and that they prefer your thief sister to go over you then there you have it. Why would you feel bad not going? \n\nYou should consider to place any grudge aside and attend if your younger sister wants all of you to attend. Since this is about for younger sister graduating not about your older sister or your dad. It's not about what happened between your older sister and you.\n\nSo the question will be do you value your experience with your younger sister or do you value this grudge more.", "INFO: what's stronger? Your love for Jenny?  Or your hatred for Becca?  If you skip the graduation, you are sending a loud message that your hatred and anger for Becca is greater than any love you have for Jenny or other members in your family.  Is that the message you want to send?", "I think NTA just because I also wouldn't go over this. It's fine if Jenny and your Dad want Becca there, but they need to accept that they can't have both of you there.", "YWBTA imo  \n\n\nIf you want to burn all bridges with your family, don't go. Shitty what your sister did for sure, but to me, you could put your issues aside for one night to show your younger sister that you are there for her. Go, sit on the other side of the venue. Afterwards find her and tell her you're proud of her, then leave. Her graduation isn't about you and what went on with the older sister. It's a huge accomplishment that should be celebrated, not ruined with family drama.   \n\n\nBut that's just my opinion on the matter.", "I'm wavering between N T A but going with ESH.\n\nYou had the opportunity to be made whole. You refused it. Your father did what most parents do-- he tried to protect all of his children. I can't blame him for that. One incident is rarely enough for a parent to cut off a child, it usually takes a consistent pattern of behavior like that. \n\nJenny is young and likely doesn't really understand the gravity of what Becca did to you here, how badly you were taken advantage of. If she was closer to Becca in the first place, she would naturally be biased in her favor as well.\n\nDon't get me wrong, you're in a shitty situation. I wouldn't blame you if you decided that you don't want to see any of them anymore. But I think that if you want to maintain a relationship with Dad and Jenny, you have to go. Punishing them for still loving your sister isn't going to do you any favors, it will just serve to ruin your sister's graduation.\n\nSide note: when you say \"comes to me when she needs something,\" what does that mean? I assumed that means you two are close, but you said she likes Becca better?", "NTA. Becca used you for everything she could get and when you told her to leave the thank you she gives you is to steal from you. It sounds like Jenny has started the trend of using you also, especially if the only time she gets in contact with you is because she needs something. I am confused about why you want to be around dad (the enabler) and the two sisters who are users.I can see why you stated that Jenny and Becca are close based off the description you provided.", "This was tough but...YWBTA if you don't go. Your older sister is an awful person, your dad enabled what happened, and your younger sister hasn't even denounced the theif sisters behavior...they all don't sound that great. But you said yourself that this is a significant milestone for your younger sister, and I agree. You can sit somewhere away from your family, find your sister after the ceremony, and congratulate her. Maybe even do something with just the 2 of you later.", "Unpopular opinion, but I think you\u2019d be TA (a little bit). I understand what Becca did is horrible, but this is about showing up for your younger sister. \n\nI think you should go, you don\u2019t have to interact with Becca. If you choose to put your problems with your older sister over Jenny, that will most definitely complicate your relationship with her.\n\n(Also, I\u2019m not sure if you expect/ want your dad and sister to cut off Becca, but that\u2019s not reasonable. It takes more than a couple of isolated incidents to cut off family!)", "ESH: While I understand a parent wanting to help their child that's in trouble... prefering one child over another isn't right.\n\nBut at the same time, if you skip out on your sister's graduation, you're hurting her, not your family.  It's sort of a \"why let them win\".  Just because you're in the same stadium as them don't mean you have to interact with them.\n\nDon't let them and their actions come between you and your younger sister.", "YWBTA\n\nSit on the other side of the stadium, as you mentioned. You don't have to talk to her, or even look at her, just be there for your younger sister. You say in this post that you were really looking forward to seeing your younger sister graduate. You shouldn't have to miss out on that opportunity because of your older sister.", "Yta. Graduation ceremonies are huge. There is no reason you can't attend separately", "YTA. \n\nThis is a once in a lifetime celebration that you would miss because of an issue you have with someone else. You have put your sister into an impossible situation. You\u2019re asking her to choose between family members who haven\u2019t harmed her. \n\nThis day isn\u2019t about you. Suck it up and celebrate with your younger sister.", "YTA. It\u2019s totally understandable that you don\u2019t want to see her. But the way that you\u2019re framing it as them preferring her over you makes you the ahole. It\u2019s your conflict, not theirs. Your sister definitely has some problems but that doesn\u2019t mean the family has to abandon her.", "YTA. They don't prefer your sister over you. They seem to have forgiven her for stealing from you, but would probably do the same for you if you had been the thief. Out of love for your graduating sister you should attend the ceremony.  To give you some perspective, my ex-husband-the father of my children, had me arrested after his gf started a fight with me when I dropped our children off at his apartment and later caused an unfounded CPS case to be opened against me. I spent two nights in jail. I've never NOT attended something for our children because he was going to be there.", "YWBTA.\n\nYou are punishing those around you for something someone else did.", "NTA. However, you might be in a damn if you do, damn if you don't situation. If you don't go, the focus will be, \"Hey where is...\" if you do go and there is so much tension between you and Becca the question/focus will be, \"What's the deal between you and Becca?'", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m here for Jenny, I want nothing to do with you.", "Agree", "Why should she support a sister that won\u2019t support her?", "Because making your conflict with someone other peoples' problem is a shitty thing to do.  There's no need to throw a high school kid into the middle of drama between two adults.", "OP is pretty much being neglected by their family, so why should she support a family that won\u2019t support her?\n\nHer dad convinced her to not file a police report, then did nothing. The rest of her family also did nothing. Her family *is* neglecting her.", "Her dad paid back all the money.  Asking for his daughter not to be given legal trouble doesn't mean he's not supporting the other one.  If you ask me, it's pretty weird to get hung up on filing a police report when you've already been compensated.  That, and everything else in this post reads to me like OP has a weird fixation on wanting to punish people.\n\nThere's a lot of talk about abandonment and lack of support when that's precisely what she's doing to her younger sister who's innocent in all this.\n\nThe older sister definitely sucks.  But demanding the rest of the family shun her from and important day in the younger sister's life, and to not even be able to be in the same *stadium* as her, is simply immature and petty as hell.", "He offered to pay back, but she didn\u2019t accept. Because the money did nothing to the emotional damage caused by her older sister.\n\nWhat it looks like she wants is some support emotionally for what happened. But she got nothing from her family. And this includes her younger sister (who is an adult), who watched it all happen and did nothing.\n\nThe rest of the family shouldn\u2019t shun the older sister, but they should\u2019ve done something. *Anything*.

Also, even though you were 'never really close,' Jenny comes to you when she needs something, but is closer to Becca? Sounds like Jenny is very similar to Becca.

If you do \"bump\" into her just give her the dead eye and keep moving.", "NTA\n\nFirst, I think you should show your dad some grace. His response was done out of love for his daughters. He wanted to make things right by you by giving you the money, but he also didn\u2019t want harm to come to her. Not to say that it was the right choice, but a choice I can see being made from a place of love.\n\nIt is understandable why you are still upset with your older sister, and wouldn\u2019t want to be around her. It also seems like you are holding onto resentment towards your younger sister for being in contact with the older. I know it can be frustrating to not have people understand your point of view, but you also cannot control others. It sounds like you would really benefit from some therapy to help you work through your family situation.\n\nTell your dad you still can\u2019t be around your older sister, but do something with your younger sister and possibly him to celebrate together.

She'll lose her shit and cause a scene and that will be on her, not you, because you refused to engage.  \n\nIf there's an after graduation dinner, I would skip that, and have a lunch date with your younger sister separately.", "YTA. You are going to the graduation for Jenny. Not for Becca. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to be near her, talk to her, or be near her.

Grow the fuck up and go be there for your sister. You dont have to communicate or acknowledge your other sister. It doesn't matter if your younger sister never publicly shamed her other sister for stealing from you. You being upset about that is dragging somebody else into a situation they have nothing to do with, dragging a child into a situation they have nothing to do with. You did the same with your dad. Your sister stole from you and you ran to tattle to daddy instead of calling the police to handle it. Of course he didn't want you to call the police and have his child arrested. I don't know if $1k still counts as petty theft or a felony, either way it'll follow her around. You're surprised that he tried to pay back the money she stole instead?

You didn\u2019t speak with your dad because he tried to pay you back? That\u2019s just stupid. \n\nHe tried to clean up a mess that one of his daughters made, and clearly that daughter has some issues. I\u2019m not saying it was the best parenting move; I don\u2019t know how your dad\u2019s tried to help your sister non-financially and maybe he\u2019s just enabling her at this point, but for you to break contact with him?? That\u2019s silly. \n\nAnd to cause a rift with your younger sister because she did \u201cnever officially denounced what Becca did\u201d?

I am sorry you aren\u2019t better supported by your father and younger sister. Skip the graduation and spend that time treating yourself instead.", "NTA consider taking sister to dinner on another day to celebrate.", "NTA. Protect your peace, don\u2019t go. Sorry your family is siding with a thieving loser.", "YWBTA. It\u2019s not about you, your dad or older sister. It\u2019s about your younger sisters graduation and accomplishment.", " It seems that her dad is the only one who wants her there at the graduation and prove to the world and/or himself that everything is fine between the 3 sisters.", "Stealing from a family member isn't something to be brushed off, but OP apparently expected her family to denounce her sister and that isn't a reasonable expectation. It's natural that it would take more than that for a father to cut off his child, and it's weird that people are do contemptuous of him trying to keep his family together. It was unkind of the OP to stop talking to him, and not going to her other sister's graduation will mostly hurt herself. OP, I won't cal you an asshole, but cut off the sister who hurt you, don't alienate your whole family.", "So the younger sister has to pay the price for it?", "On the other hand, seems like both sisters go to OP only when they need something... \n\n(Based on what OP said about little sister relying on them for help but favoring her relationship with oldest sister)", "That's very Mature. Be the BETTER Person. Compromise, If you want any kind of relationship.", "Agreed. My older siblings were estranged from each other when I graduated college (still are) but they both showed up for me. They didn\u2019t show up for each other, but they played nice because they both loved me, their little sister. \n\nFWIW, OP, due to a series of events one of my sibs and i arent really in contact now either, but that was years later. If your older sister doesn\u2019t shape up, you may find she eventually burns her bridges with the rest of the family. Don\u2019t burn your bridges first.", "This is how I\u2019m thinking about this case. Does she love the younger sister more than she hates the other one? If yes go to the graduation, be civil, leave. If not, fuck them all and enjoy life free from the burden of family obligations  forever.", "Agreed. If you care at all about your younger sister, you won't make her graduation day about you.", "Yup, and she seems hell bent to ruin the day for her sister because of drama that has nothing to do with her sister, drama her sister refused to let OP drag her into by the sound of it.", "Agreed with all of this. Of course what her sister did was wrong and OP doesn\u2019t have to forgive her but it\u2019s unreasonable to expect everyone else to cut off their immediate relative, and expect a parent to cut off their child, over something bad they did, and to hold a grudge against her younger sister, for something that happened between OP and the older sister. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone has done something bad before, unless it\u2019s a long-standing pattern of fucking everyone in the family over and being terrible to everyone (which doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s the case) then it\u2019s just ridiculous to burn bridges with everyone because they won\u2019t cut off and disown their child or sister. It\u2019s immature in my opinion, and crazy to me as someone who would do anything to have living parents, to be willing to cut off your parent because they won\u2019t disown their child, and immature to not be able to put it aside for a single day to be there for younger sister who did nothing wrong. Again, yes, of course what older sister did was wrong and she should apologize and try to make it right, but OP taking what her sister did to her out on the entire family is immature and shitty imo. YTA", "I think there are more layers to that. \n\nJenny also shows tendencies to take advantage of OP. And when it comes to friendship Jenny and Becca are closer.\n\nAnd the father enables all that for the sake of family peace.\n\nSo everybody is pushing the victim to overcome her feelings to go back to normal.\n\nI go for NTA because the whole bunch of them are going on to hurt OP with their ignorance.", "The same can be said of father and younger sister. Is having a cheating, lying stealing sister around more important or is having OP there more important. It will end at a state where OP is forced to be continually be at the same space as the person who betrayed her. And that will be the same question you will continually ask her.", "I don't think it was about choice but the fact no one in the family took her side or tried to hold Becka accountable.  Dad offered to pay her back the money so they wouldn't fight. Like her sister straight up stole from her. It's more about the breach of trust than the money.\n\nNTA", "[removed]", "Yup, it's called being a grown up", "It wasn't about the money, it was the emotional fact of betrayal. Difficult to fix that with money.", "The sister thst didn't invite her to the graduation? Lol her dad invited her.", ">And YTA if you intend to punish your dad and sister because you think they should be punishing your thief sister.\n\n\n\nThe father talked her out of suing her sister. Op didn't take his $$, younger sister did not directly invite Op. Family is still on good terms with thief sister.\n\nAt which point is Op supposed to feel like anyone of them have her back? \n\nOp is NTA for looking out for her own self.", ">It seems that her dad is the only one who wants her there at the graduation and prove to the world and/or himself that everything is fine between the 3 sisters.\n\nThis is most likely the case here.\n\nOP is only going to hurt the feelings of her father who don't give a f about her feelings in the first place.\n\nThere is no familiy peace to be kept.\n\nNo bridges to be burnt.\n\nThe damage is already done.\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s not about paying the price but she\u2019s definitely old enough to understand the severity of stealing especially a large sum like $1k. OP housed and provided for their older sister for months just for them to turn around and do that. OPis hurt by not only older sister\u2019s actions but by everyone else basically coddling her and acting like it\u2019s water under the bridge.", "Sure, if she's going to take sides. Besides, how is she suffering? It's not like she gave OP an invite anyway. She sounds like a user tbh, OP's better off not going.", "It's not about price, it's about boundaries.", "No, her sister\u2019s graduation is not the place for addressing other sibling issues. It\u2019s about her graduation - not causing drama to distract from that. OP can attend separately from the family, congratulate her sister, and just duck out. Or just not go if OP can\u2019t even manage that, although that says OP\u2019s drama with the bad sister is more important than her graduation.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to demand others feel the same outrage as OP justifiably feels towards her thieving sister. You often see this when a family member is an addict - some people absolutely HATE the addict, while others just want to everyone to hold hands and sing kumbaya with their eyes closed. Or see the addict as fundamentally ok, but just fallen on hard times.\n\nThat said, OP\u2019s outrage and hatred is \ud83d\udcaf% justifiable and understandable - it\u2019s more a question if she wants to cut the rest of her family out of her life. Maybe she should, but there\u2019s a lot more to that story.", "This was my thought too. Und daddy enables both of them to do so. \n\nIn my opinion OP just can't stand the toxidity of that family and the bridges are already burnt by them.", "Exactly. It sounds like both sisters and Dad suck. Dollars to donuts says that they'll all accuse OP of being petty if they skip the stupid high school graduation ceremony.", "NTA. I see that pattern, too. The sisters are takers and OP is only appreciated by her family for what she can give. The father enables this behaviour. In some family the self-reliant, successful siblings are coaxed, pushed or bullied into helping the less responsible siblings, because some parents think that all their children should be equal.\n\nIt's time to cut the crap for OP. She may get in touch with her sister when both are self reliant and baby sister is not just looking for a transactional relationship.", "Yes, that\u2019s an excellent idea - attend an event celebrating one of the most important moments of Jenny\u2019s life so far and cause a scene by refusing to be civil to Becca while she\u2019s there. If it\u2019s going to cause a lot of tension and potential squabbling OP is better off not going.", "Support is good. Boundaries are good. BUT they come with an acknowledgement of wrong doing, remorse, apologies etc. Is it better for the younger sister to miss one of her sisters being there? Or risk the confrontation/drama of them both turning up?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
