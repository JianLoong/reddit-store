We\u2019re no longer that close, but we still keep in touch, and she actually introduced me to my fianc\u00e9 in college. So, I asked her to be a bridesmaid.\n\nThe first time we meet, Amy brings Spud, her really cute pug. Unfortunately, I am *really* allergic to dogs. I mention this to her. She says that he has to accompany her because he\u2019s her emotional support dog.\n\nI\u2019m not very knowledgable on support animals, but I respect their role so I try to accept it \u2014 but by the end of the day I\u2019m a mess. Just disgusting and I feel awful. I pull Amy aside and ask if there\u2019s any way she can leave Spud at home for the next meeting. She becomes upset, stating that for health reasons he has to accompany her, and I back down. After two more meetings, though, I can\u2019t do it because I feel too sick.\n\nI pull her aside again and tell her that I just can\u2019t be in the same room as Spud. She mentions she already bought him a little suit for the wedding, and I inform her there\u2019s just no way he can come. My ceremony is in a tiny church and he and I will inevitably be in close proximity.\n\nThis kicks off a big discussion about the importance of support animals and mental health. I completely agree that mental health is significant and understand that Spud is helpful to her, but in the context of my wedding I just can\u2019t be around a dog. She asks if she had a medical condition, like seizures or diabetes, and needed Spud to help her survive if I would kick him out. I admitted I would have to think about it. She stated this is an example of ableism and that his role is just as important.\n\nI then ask if he can come to the wedding, but stay outside with her partner, or something, for the ceremony, and then join her for the reception (which is outside). She asks alternatively if I can just take an antihistamine for the ceremony. I let her know they don\u2019t work for me completely and I get really groggy so I\u2019d rather not. For another event I\u2019d consider it, but for my own wedding I just don\u2019t want to make that kind of compromise.\n\nI have a few more exchanges with her and neither of us is budging. I then tell her that if she insists on bringing Spud to the ceremony, I\u2019m going to ask her not to attend. Shes upset and tells the rest of the wedding party, whose opinions are split. Another bridesmaid is now refusing to go unless I reinvite Spud. I have still refused.\n\nSo, now both Amy and this bridesmaid have venmoed me for the cost of their dresses, and Spud\u2019s suit. I paid them. But they are still talking to more guests at the wedding about it and I just feel exhausted.\nI\u2019m torn between annoyed at the impact this is having on my own wedding, but also the concern that I have made a cruel decision. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if the right thing to do was to suck it up and let him come.

It's YOUR wedding! I'm the most sympathetic to service animals as I grew up with my blind dad's guide dog. Although they're legally allowed in public places, if she needs more emotional support than being around her partner and friends (enough to trash you to others) she has bigger problems than the cost of a dog's tuxedo.

I'd say that makes her the TA. She basically admits, when asking *if* Spud was for a medical reason you'd feel the same way, that he isn't, so she should be able to survive half an hour without him... and if not sit outside.\n\nMaybe I just read way too much AITA... but it is just me and it is *only* ESA owners who are actually jerks? It feels like people with actual service animals like a seeing-eye dog or medical alert dog are always very understanding of the limitations that having their companion entails, and are usually willing to try and find the best compromise for everyone. It is ESA owners who seem to think they are entitled to break all the rules (and to be sure, I don't mean to paint with a broad brush. Plenty of people with ESAs are lovely and considerate too... It just seems it also is something which attracts some real asses...)\n\nETA: If you guys work through this, and come to an agreeable understanding (the obvious and rational one being either she misses the ceremony or survives without Spud for thirty minutes, and then can bring him to the reception), please, for the love of all that is holy, provide an uipdate post and make sure it has a picture of Spud in his little suit.

It wouldn't surprise me if the other bridesmaid didn't understand the difference between a service animal and an emotional support animal, and this 'friend' conveniently did not educate her. It's kind of gross, if you ask me. Imagine being so up your own ass that you think the goddamn BRIDE has to be miserable at her own wedding to accommodate you. Unbelievable. \n\nNTA.", "NTA but don't pay for that suit!!!", "So, it's *your* wedding, yet she's trying to make you miserable on that day?  Emotional support doesn't mean service dog.  You legitimately can't be around him because you're allergic and she's willing to compromise your health on your big day.  That's not a friend.  NTA.", "Since 5 Days, every 2nd story is about a service dog at a wedding...???", "NTA.  She sounds entitled.", "NTA - You have conflicting medical needs and it's your wedding so you win. Period. That other people are expecting you to be highly doped up to go to your own wedding is just insane. Even if this were a legit service animal for medical needs like seizures you still wouldn't have to let it come to a private event. She sounds dramatic. I'm sorry you're having to go through this.", "NTA in any way", "NTA. The health of bride takes priority over health of bridesmaid in this scenario. You are not the AH for setting boundaries to protect your health. She is not the AH for sitting the wedding out due to said boundaries interfering with her health. She is the AH for suggesting that her health is more important than your health and that you should compromise your health to accommodate her.", "NTA. She seems to think her mental health takes precedence over your physical health and *ability to breathe*. \n\nThis is a nuanced conversation that would have us running in circles, because mental health is important. But at your wedding, you need to breathe and be clear-headed.", "NTA. \nMy gosh I can\u2019t believe that woman. I wouldn\u2019t bother being friends with her anymore. \nIt\u2019s not like you just don\u2019t like dogs but you are ALLERGIC.", "You asked I she could leave him a few hours/minutes and the compromised to let him be at reception.\nThats a lot more that I would do in your case\n\nNTA\n\nyour plan was solid. She could have her +1 and dog if she felt ill/needed to step aside for a minute and be conforted", "NTA. Amy is being able-ist. Allergies are at least as much of a disability as whatever mental health issue she has. As another comment mentions, only one of you is required to be at your wedding. \n\nEveryone saying you should allow the dog is making a value judgment about whose disability is more important to accommodate at your wedding. Basically, you should be miserable, so your friend can be at and enjoy your wedding. WTF.", "ESA\u2019a are pets for people that refuse to do proper therapy and meds. I\u2019m going to get downvoted into oblivion for this opinion, but NTA.

There are two competing health needs here: one person \"needs\" to be around a dog, and one person has a debilitating allergy to dogs and needs to NOT be around dogs. \n\nWhen there are two competing health needs, it might be hard to decide which health need will win out.

Therefore, only one of us will be able to be at my wedding, me or Amy.\"", "This needs to be top comment. While ESA may have a place, they are not protected as Service Animals are. Most are merely pets. They may make the owner feel better (studies have shown that even thinking about petting an animal can lower blood pressure), but they are not support animals, and can actually cause harm to a true service animal because they are not trained to be in public the way a true service animal is. Fake service animals are harmful in this same way, and what a lot of people who want to take their dogs places or have an ESA say they have.", "ESAs are essentially a living safety blanket, a comfort item. Comfort items can really help people but most adults know you can't take your safety blanket everywhere and it's only one of the coping mechanisms. During the day when you can't be at home you need to rely on other methods or things to get through the day until you can get home to the safety blanket or in some people's cases their ESA.\n\nESAs are not service animals and even if they were a person with dog allergies has just as much right to deny someone with a service dog entry into their home or wedding venues in this case.", "IMO even if it was a service animal, the bride's allergy would take priority at a wedding. It would suck, but it's the bride's day, she gets to make the decision on whether or not she wants the dog there regardless of why the dog needs to be there.", "Right, she even said the dog could come to the reception. If she can't be without the dog for a 20 minute ceremony she has deeper issues. Who did she think was supposed to look after the dog while she does bridesmaid duties like taking pics, helping the bride with stuff pre-wedding, etc. Just makes no sense", "I don\u2019t know, but he is very well trained and polite. I\u2019ve met dogs that are overly friendly and jump, or bark, or lick you, and he\u2019s not like that at all. He also wears a large red collar with the acronym \u201cESA\u201d written around it. But he doesn\u2019t have a vest.", "There's no training for ESAs. They're just pets that bring comfort to their owners and can calm them down. Any animal can be an ESA.", "Depending on where you are, training for support animals isn't necessary and may not even be a thing. And in the US, for actual service animals, you can train the animal yourself, there's no like 'official' hoops you have to jump through for that, just gotta make sure you're meeting the legal requirements like keeping the animal under control.", "Actually, in a workplace conflict, the person with allergies would have the upper hand (with an ESA).  The legal right to an ESA is only housing related.  The ADA does recognize allergies as a \"disability\" that should have reasonable accommodation HOWEVER genuine service dogs (and miniature ponies) trump allergies so in that case the person with the service animal would prevail.", "I mean this in the very kindest way-- to answer your question I think the difference between ESA owners and actual Service Dog owners is that statistically the former group is basically made up of people struggling with mental health issues.", "Apparently she does. I haven\u2019t seen her in person since before COVID, and she didn\u2019t have a dog then, but according to her he is with her all the time now. She works from home so I can believe it.", "She says she didn\u2019t know, which is a little surprising given how long we\u2019ve known each other, but I do believe her.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell me about him but also thought I knew about him.

Am surprised anyone is in guests side\u2026 most likely they are thinking it\u2019s a service dog, not an emotional support pet.  If the guest can\u2019t even sit through a short ceremony without her dog, then perhaps she needs more help on her issues.

At all. NTA, this is your day. I think asking her in the first place was pretty generous. She is already making it about her and her needs, imagine her on the day?", "I feel like it's her emotional support animal, she should have told you that they are a package deal at the time of accepting being a bridesmaid. \n\nAn allergy is an allergy. She shouldn't fault you for that. You gave her multiple options, she didnt like them. You paid for the dresses and .... dog tuxedo... if she's still complaining and talking badly about you now, imagine how much of a nightmare she would have been actually in the wedding. NTA, and good riddance IMO", "That wasn't what I was referring to, I just explained myself poorly.
