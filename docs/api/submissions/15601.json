{"id": 15601, "submission_id": "12xs57n", "title": "AITA for uninviting a bridesmaid to my wedding because of her support dog?", "selftext": "For context, me and \u201cAmy\u201d have been friends since elementary school. We\u2019re no longer that close, but we still keep in touch, and she actually introduced me to my fianc\u00e9 in college. So, I asked her to be a bridesmaid.\n\nThe first time we meet, Amy brings Spud, her really cute pug. Unfortunately, I am *really* allergic to dogs. I mention this to her. She says that he has to accompany her because he\u2019s her emotional support dog.\n\nI\u2019m not very knowledgable on support animals, but I respect their role so I try to accept it \u2014 but by the end of the day I\u2019m a mess. Just disgusting and I feel awful. I pull Amy aside and ask if there\u2019s any way she can leave Spud at home for the next meeting. She becomes upset, stating that for health reasons he has to accompany her, and I back down. After two more meetings, though, I can\u2019t do it because I feel too sick.\n\nI pull her aside again and tell her that I just can\u2019t be in the same room as Spud. She mentions she already bought him a little suit for the wedding, and I inform her there\u2019s just no way he can come. My ceremony is in a tiny church and he and I will inevitably be in close proximity.\n\nThis kicks off a big discussion about the importance of support animals and mental health. I completely agree that mental health is significant and understand that Spud is helpful to her, but in the context of my wedding I just can\u2019t be around a dog. She asks if she had a medical condition, like seizures or diabetes, and needed Spud to help her survive if I would kick him out. I admitted I would have to think about it. She stated this is an example of ableism and that his role is just as important.\n\nI then ask if he can come to the wedding, but stay outside with her partner, or something, for the ceremony, and then join her for the reception (which is outside). She asks alternatively if I can just take an antihistamine for the ceremony. I let her know they don\u2019t work for me completely and I get really groggy so I\u2019d rather not. For another event I\u2019d consider it, but for my own wedding I just don\u2019t want to make that kind of compromise.\n\nI have a few more exchanges with her and neither of us is budging. I then tell her that if she insists on bringing Spud to the ceremony, I\u2019m going to ask her not to attend. Shes upset and tells the rest of the wedding party, whose opinions are split. Another bridesmaid is now refusing to go unless I reinvite Spud. I have still refused.\n\nSo, now both Amy and this bridesmaid have venmoed me for the cost of their dresses, and Spud\u2019s suit. I paid them. But they are still talking to more guests at the wedding about it and I just feel exhausted.\nI\u2019m torn between annoyed at the impact this is having on my own wedding, but also the concern that I have made a cruel decision. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if the right thing to do was to suck it up and let him come. AITA?\n\n\u2014\n\n**Edit:** A lot of people are asking why I paid for the clothes. A combination of feeling guilty but also I just thought it would fix the drama (it didn\u2019t, lol, but I do think it helped a little). I also think I\u2019m in a better place financially, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Just easier.

It's YOUR wedding! I'm the most sympathetic to service animals as I grew up with my blind dad's guide dog. Although they're legally allowed in public places, if she needs more emotional support than being around her partner and friends (enough to trash you to others) she has bigger problems than the cost of a dog's tuxedo.

I'd say that makes her the TA. She basically admits, when asking *if* Spud was for a medical reason you'd feel the same way, that he isn't, so she should be able to survive half an hour without him... and if not sit outside.\n\nMaybe I just read way too much AITA... but it is just me and it is *only* ESA owners who are actually jerks? It feels like people with actual service animals like a seeing-eye dog or medical alert dog are always very understanding of the limitations that having their companion entails, and are usually willing to try and find the best compromise for everyone. It is ESA owners who seem to think they are entitled to break all the rules (and to be sure, I don't mean to paint with a broad brush. Plenty of people with ESAs are lovely and considerate too... It just seems it also is something which attracts some real asses...)\n\nETA: If you guys work through this, and come to an agreeable understanding (the obvious and rational one being either she misses the ceremony or survives without Spud for thirty minutes, and then can bring him to the reception), please, for the love of all that is holy, provide an uipdate post and make sure it has a picture of Spud in his little suit.
