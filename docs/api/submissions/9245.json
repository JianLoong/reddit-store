She told a group of coworkers that she doesn\u2019t drink and then told a different group that she was hungover because she was throwing them back the night before.

It\u2019s borderline psychotic because who does that?!\nSo last week I had enough when she told me that she couldn\u2019t do her share of our 2 month project that was due that week. She didn\u2019t do any of it\u2026.her excuse was that she went to go visit her dads grave and work was too much. For 2 whole months?! I was livid, especially because she kept saying she was working on it. So I told her ask such. I said \u201cI know your dad passing was a huge traumatic and horrible time and I get that 100% but if you can not do your job then you should take leave or let Managment know because now I\u2019m on the hook for your portion which I shouldn\u2019t have to do.\u201d She just looked at me and started crying.

Dont get me wrong, she sounds like she has some issues but none of that really has anything to do with you \u2026 yet. She can be as weird and annoying as she wants to be, until it impacts her work performance. Now that it bas, you needed to go to your manager etc.", "Isn\u2019t it the worst!

Other coworkers have brought it up and we talk about it when it gets crazier than usual at work. It feels like we have to baby her and she\u2019s older than us it\u2019s even more awk.", "Yeah I feel maybe I shouldn\u2019t have shown her my frustration because I feel like that fuels her crazy.", "Exactly!

I totally agree this can\u2019t continue!", "It actually insane that management hasn\u2019t done anything because so many clients started calling the receptionists desk because she doesn\u2019t follow up or pick up their calls and doesn\u2019t respond to emails. Because of her we\u2019ve lost so many partnerships and donations.

You need to bring it up to your boss that you are doing HER job. No need to bring up her dad.

You can't just do her work for her and none of the managers know about it. You can't just lie to them and say she actually did her half.", "Start documenting when she isn't doing her job.Date, time, incident. Put it on a spreadsheet, if she is as bad as all that, it won't take you long to log 20 or so incidents on it then have coworkers sign/ confirm said incidents and take a copy to management and tell them she is creating a toxic workplace because she cannot do her job properly or that she is causing the company to lose money...she may not be exceptionally toxic, but a coworker who won't work creates resentment for the entire team and is just unhealthy. Making you guys all dislike YOUR jobs because she won't get reprimanded or dismissed. Then they run the risk of having the rest of you quit because it's gotten so unpleasant that nobody wants to be there and that isn't fair to you OR the business.", "I lost my father during the lockdown and had the manage the whole shitshow.

Other coworkers feel the same as me because we talk about it.", "I definitely second what u/GarlicAndSapphire said. I\u2019m sure many of your coworkers are having to do more than their fair share because she\u2019s being assigned to things and not doing them. You talking to management isn\u2019t criticizing her for grieving, it\u2019s telling management they need to delegate differently. I think what you said was really polite, but unless you\u2019re her superior it\u2019s not your job to tell her how to manage her own life, so definitely talk to someone who can lol!", "Be sure to include clients names as well if the incident involves a client.", "I totally agree.  It's been hard watching my older son learn to drive knowing how excited it would have made my dad but dwelling on it like she does is problematic and is why therapy exists."]}
