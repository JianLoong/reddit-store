While browsing Amazon, I came across \"First Day of School\" Chalk boards and bought one with chalk markers to do with my daughter the night before school starts. They came in the mail very quickly so I put them aside with a few other purchases as I didn't need them for a few days and the family was getting ready to go away for a Labor Day vacation. \n\nCue tonight--the Monday before school starts. My daughter and I went to pick up some school supplies and then returned home to play in the pool in the yard. My husband (41M) refused to be outside with myself and the kids (I also have a 2M) because the weather was hot. He played video games for 2 hours. When the kids and I went inside at 6pm, I gave the kids baths (it was 'my' night) and then cooked dinner for everyone. After dinner, I sat down with Tegan to fill out the Chalk boards so it would dry for tomorrow's picture (I also wanted to relax for a few minutes!)\n\nHusband came storming in the living room where we were sitting. Immediately, he started arguing with me over the boards. He was upset because:  \n\n1) I didn't ask him before purchasing or show him what I was purchasing \n\n2) I didn't inform him of the purchase \n\n3) I didn't inform him what the boards were or when I was going to fill them out with my daughter  \n\nHe accused me, in front of my daughter, of being selfish, inconsiderate and rude in regards to his feelings. He called me 'disgusting'. When I suggested he sit down with us on the couch, he claimed he was still eating and therefore, not ready. When I reminded him the boards were about our daughter going to K, he replied that I 'screwed up' in not including him. I once again invited him to sit on the couch with us but he said no. He went into the kitchen and hasn't spoken to me since even though I have been reminding him that WE will be taking pictures tomorrow and WE will be dropping her off together. \n\nWas I an asshole in not sharing simple boards with him before purchasing? The whole point is for my daughter to hold them while WE celebrate this milestone with her--not to worry about who is filling them out. Did I 'screw up'? I thought as parents we were suppose to be caring about our daughter and her worries about school! Was I the asshole?

Maybe he is sick of the marriage, maybe he is depressed, maybe there is work stress, I don\u2019t know. But he is choosing to spend time on his own pursuits rather than be around you guys in an engaged way and he knows that\u2019s shitty behavior on his part. I feel like this guilt is being translated into anger at you. He knows he should have been spending time with you guys and realized he missed or nearly missed a \u201cmoment\u201d. It\u2019s a lot easier to yell at you about how it\u2019s your fault for not telling than it is to admit fault in himself that he is so checked out that he doesn\u2019t know what is going on and isn\u2019t a hands on father.", "INFO: His reaction is extreme.

Or is this his normal behavior?", "NTA, unless you stay with this jerk and ruin your children\u2019s childhood. WtF is wrong with him???? This is 100% unacceptable behavior. Also, how can he still be eating dinner if you and the kids are in the living room? Are you not having dinner together? My goodness.

Sure, it would have been nice if you'd shared the chalkboard plans, but I don't know your day to day or communication levels, and it's not *that* big of deal that you didn't mention it.

It would have been more appropriate to share in the excitement, get involved or leave ya'll to it, and then address it with you in private if it had concerned him that much. I don't know if this was a build up of angst on his part, or if is regularly this controlling and domineering. If he IS like this all of the time, I would consider leaving him...

To the person who keeps saying he hates you, that isn't necessarily true.  My ex loved me.  He didn't want to be with anyone one else.  He was just really messed up.  He had explosive anger that he took out on me.  I could totally relate to your post where you said he got mad at you for making cookies while he was playing magic.   I can guarantee that he was losing and came upstairs to take it out on you because he was mad.  You are his verbal punching bag.  I was my ex-husband's verbal and physical punching bag.  I remember once we were playing pinochle with my parents, and he threw a card and was angry that they lost the hand.  When we were about to leave and putting things in our hatchback, he slammed it on my forehead.   My head was bleeding everywhere, and he calmly looked me in the eyes and said, \"Did I throw a jack or a king\"  I didn't even think he was still mad.  He called me names all the time.   I never knew what would set him off.  He also told me that if I left, he would kill me.  I stayed with him for 30 years because I didn't know there were better men. I didn't have anywhere to go, and he told me he would kill me if I left.\n\nWhen I realized there were men in this world that don't hit women or verbally abuse women, I  left and stayed with a friend.   He told our bank teller that he was going to kill me and she called the police.   He was surrounded when he showed up at my friend's house with a weapon.   He told the police he wasn't really going to kill me, and they let him go.  I asked my police officer neighbor, if I should get a restraining order and he said a piece of paper won't stop a bullet.   He robbed my apartment once.  \n\nIt all ended when he called our now adult son and told him he was putting down his dog.  He told my son to come see the dog the next day.  He then went and put down our sons dog and committed suicide.   I am positive he wanted our son to find him.  My ex-husband found his mother dead from suicide when he graduated from high school,  so he knew how devastating it could be, and he tried to put his own son through that.  \n\nThrough the years I loved him, I hated him, I was terrified of him, he tore me down, he hurt me.  Now I just have pity for him.  I couldn't imagine going through life with that much explosive anger, resentment, and hate. I realized after he passed that I had been clenching my jaw for years.\n\nPlease don't let this happen to your children. \n\nI'm sorry if this is a huge overshare, and I'm sorry if this doesn't apply to you.

At the end of the day he shouldn\u2019t had done what he did, he should had been the bigger person to control his emotions and to have just joined in.
