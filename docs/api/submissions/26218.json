While browsing Amazon, I came across \"First Day of School\" Chalk boards and bought one with chalk markers to do with my daughter the night before school starts. They came in the mail very quickly so I put them aside with a few other purchases as I didn't need them for a few days and the family was getting ready to go away for a Labor Day vacation. \n\nCue tonight--the Monday before school starts. My daughter and I went to pick up some school supplies and then returned home to play in the pool in the yard. My husband (41M) refused to be outside with myself and the kids (I also have a 2M) because the weather was hot. He played video games for 2 hours. When the kids and I went inside at 6pm, I gave the kids baths (it was 'my' night) and then cooked dinner for everyone. After dinner, I sat down with Tegan to fill out the Chalk boards so it would dry for tomorrow's picture (I also wanted to relax for a few minutes!)\n\nHusband came storming in the living room where we were sitting. Immediately, he started arguing with me over the boards. He was upset because:  \n\n1) I didn't ask him before purchasing or show him what I was purchasing \n\n2) I didn't inform him of the purchase \n\n3) I didn't inform him what the boards were or when I was going to fill them out with my daughter  \n\nHe accused me, in front of my daughter, of being selfish, inconsiderate and rude in regards to his feelings. He called me 'disgusting'. When I suggested he sit down with us on the couch, he claimed he was still eating and therefore, not ready. When I reminded him the boards were about our daughter going to K, he replied that I 'screwed up' in not including him. I once again invited him to sit on the couch with us but he said no. He went into the kitchen and hasn't spoken to me since even though I have been reminding him that WE will be taking pictures tomorrow and WE will be dropping her off together. \n\nWas I an asshole in not sharing simple boards with him before purchasing? The whole point is for my daughter to hold them while WE celebrate this milestone with her--not to worry about who is filling them out. Did I 'screw up'?

He is basically saying that you can't do anything without his approval. You're \"disgusting\" for buying a CHALK BOARD?\" This is not a major purchase. If you went out and spent hundreds or thousands of dollars on a whim, I could understand being a bit annoyed but this is what, $10? And it's a *chalkboard*, there's nothing controversial about a chalkboard.\n\nAnd the fact that you are even asking if you are TA means that you have probably been conditioned already to defer to him. \n\nDoes he consult you on every little thing he purchases for your daughter, or is this one of his \"rules for thee, but not for me\"?\n\nNTA but if you don't do something about this situation it is going to be very damaging to your daughter's mental health. She's going to grow up learning that she can't do anything unless a man tells her she can, and that will make her vulnerable to getting into abusive relationships herself in the future.", "NTA. I don\u2019t imagine those things are an expensive purchase at all. Everyone has to have some freedom to purchase little things like that. If he came home with say, a new Barbie doll for her, I don\u2019t think you would flip out, right? \n\nHe is wildly out of line for calling you \u2018disgusting\u2019 (How? Why? WTF?!) and if he had a problem, it would have been appropriate to ask if you wouldn\u2019t mind coming to the kitchen (or wherever) for a moment or waiting until she was in bed. There\u2019s no reason to fly off the handle to that extent.\n\nUnless you have tens of thousands in cc debt, this doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal\u2026 and even then, his reaction seems wildly over the top for the claimed \u2018offense\u2019.", "NTA but your husband sure is. Is he always this irrational and controlling? This is a major red flag.", "NTA. Your husband sounds like an abusive, lazy, childish jerk. \\] If he calls you 'disgusting' in front of your child, it's only a matter of time before his ugly behaviour escalates. And he won't stop with you - your children are at risk, physically and emotionally, with this asshole as their father. Get out while you can and give your kids a chance at a good life.", "NTA I think youve got a bigger problem than a chalkboard. Here\u2019s what I see in his behavior - a man who doesn\u2019t want to spend time with his family for whatever reason. Maybe he is sick of the marriage, maybe he is depressed, maybe there is work stress, I don\u2019t know. But he is choosing to spend time on his own pursuits rather than be around you guys in an engaged way and he knows that\u2019s shitty behavior on his part. I feel like this guilt is being translated into anger at you. He knows he should have been spending time with you guys and realized he missed or nearly missed a \u201cmoment\u201d. It\u2019s a lot easier to yell at you about how it\u2019s your fault for not telling than it is to admit fault in himself that he is so checked out that he doesn\u2019t know what is going on and isn\u2019t a hands on father.", "INFO: His reaction is extreme. What if you reacted this way to him not joining pool time? Parenting is a give and take experience. \"Disgusting\" is not your behavior. What else could be going on with him?", "NTA and that is a massive overreaction.  You are not TA for not asking/informing him that you bought these off of amazon.  Could there be something going on that you don't know about:  issues at work?  Possibly losing his job?  Money troubles?  Or is this his normal behavior?", "NTA, unless you stay with this jerk and ruin your children\u2019s childhood. WtF is wrong with him???? This is 100% unacceptable behavior. Also, how can he still be eating dinner if you and the kids are in the living room? Are you not having dinner together? My goodness. Talk about destroying what should be a really important, loving shared experience for the family.", "NTA. His reaction seems wildly out of proportion to the situation. Red flags going off here.", "\u2026.why did you marry this man? NTA", "My EX threw a fit when my children were younger. Around 9 and 11. I spent $300.00, on school clothes, backpacks,  school supplies for 2 kids. He accused me of, \" not living on a budget\". Yet, he would go to bars, had his hobbies ect. The next day, i filled for divorce. That was over 25 years ago and I've never been happier that I'm no longer with a controlling AH. OP, is not TAH. She shouldn't have to ask permission to buy anything for her children, within means. Especially,  when it's for educational reasons.", "NTA\n\nWhat's up with your husband? Does he always behave like this?", "Edit: I just read all the comments and your replies. Your husband is a full on red flag waving AH and I highly recommend you get your child away from him before SHE begins to think this is how a man is supposed to act.\n\nINFO: Is money so tight that the purchase of those boards will mess with your monthly budget? If so, then you are the AH. When money trouble surface, even the smallest purchases can make a big difference.\n\nIf not, he is the AH. Does he over react like this to a lot of things? Is this new behavior? What else does he feel he needs to have full control of?", "I do not understand this reaction at all. Is this real? If it is I have some very serious concerns for your safety and the future safety of your children\u2026", "NTA\nYour husband turned a lovely project with your child to motivate her to celebrate starting kindergarten into a terrifying outburst of rage. Abusers are often good time ruiners like that. He's controlling and abusive, creating rules \"you broke\" after the fact as an excuse to rage at you and your children.\n\nYour children are growing up believing this is normal. How you respond to his abusive behavior will be part of their beliefs about what marriage and relationships are like.", "NTA - you should\u2019ve been out the door after the cookie incident", "NTA.  I routinely do stuff like that and my husband\u2019s response is always something like \u201coh great idea, thanks for thinking of it.  You are a great mom\u201d.  Your husband\u2019s reaction is wildly inappropriate.", "Holy crap! He is so controlling! That's a harbinger of financial abuse.\n\nNTA\n\nMy hubby and I have been married 9 years. I like to play poker. I was at the casino this past weekend playing various tournaments that I didn't cash in. I lost over $1k. Did hubby shout at me? No. He commiserated with me on the bad beats and other players getting lucky. He told me to keep playing smart and I'll win it next time.\n\nMind you, we're empty nesters and this is the 2nd marriage for both of us.\n\nBut a $10 chalk board? And he berates you in front of the kids? You need to start a FU binder and log everything so you'll have the details when you get a divorce lawyer.  You may not be ready now, but it's comming.", "NTA. Sure, it would have been nice if you'd shared the chalkboard plans, but I don't know your day to day or communication levels, and it's not *that* big of deal that you didn't mention it. It's deeply concerning how he reacted, especially that he acted this way in front of your daughter. It would have been more appropriate to share in the excitement, get involved or leave ya'll to it, and then address it with you in private if it had concerned him that much. I don't know if this was a build up of angst on his part, or if is regularly this controlling and domineering. If he IS like this all of the time, I would consider leaving him... This is abusive and not a healthy dynamic or environment for your children to grow up witnessing.", "INFO: You said you bought the boards along \"with a few other purchases\" that you set aside until after your Labor Day weekend. Were those purchases also unplanned and was your husband also mad about them too? \n\nAlso, are you on a strict budget?", "NTA. Your husband sounds like he was upset about something else (could he be anxious about your daughter starting school?). Whatever it is, he reacted very poorly. \"disgusting\"? Really, what was his problem?", "The action I want judgement on was purchasing something without input from my husband and when the item came in, forgetting of informing him of the purchase and the intention behind it. I believe I might be the asshole because I didn't include him in the pre-steps leading up to us filling out the first day boards.", "I would say NTA. I would say you guys have bigger issues with your relationship than chalk boards. I assume you have a budget item for school supplies.\n\nI think you may not be telling us some information and this isn't about chalk boards at all and maybe a large issue with you buying stuff without discussing it as a couple.\n\nMoney is both yours in the marriage, not one or the other, but I would think most families would budget for school supplies. He definitely over reacted probably because of something else and nothing to do with the boards or your kids.\n\nIf this is not the case, you husband has some mental issues that should be looked it.\n\nWhen someone uses the word 'disgusting', you have some serious marriage issues going down.\n\nSo what is eating at him ?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
