I do this for my mother who is constantly on a (not very successful) diet, the sweets and chocolate go in the sweets and chocolate box, which lives in my room. You want a key to open the sweets and chocolate box.\n\nI do this because I care that she's trying to make a change, and want to help her in that, and because she specifically asked me to. It's honestly a very small ask.", "NTA. Congratulations on your progress! Unfortunately if you have an addictive personality it's really easy to substitute one vice for another and it's not unreasonable to ask your BF to support your journey by being discrete with his snacks or other things. However there is a limit to how discrete it's possible to be with food items. If he was leaving alcohol on display then I'd say there was a larger issue, but junk food is just something that is common to have in your home and it's his home too.\n\nYou're NTA for asking, but I do also see his perspective. Perhaps a compromise? Maybe buy an opaque storage box that fits in a cupboard and ask him to keep the 'treats' in it? That way they're out of sight but still accessible for him?\n\nI saw a tiktok video earlier this week by Ben Carpenter @bdccarpenter discussing how outright denial or complete restriction of a treat item increases the dopamine payoff and increases the craving when you allow yourself a treat, whereas if you expose yourself to a treat item regularly, it manages the dopamine payoff and prevents binging. He has some source data (he admits the data is slim though) and it's worth a look.\n\nI've been on WW (weight watchers) and it's haaaarrrrd. So hard. But my husband and I work around the restrictions by sharing treat items. E.g. If we go somewhere for a coffee, we share a cake or muffin instead of having 1 each. I substitute high point items for equivalent point value in lower point items - it gives me more for my 'money' so boosts the dopamine reward and fools my brain into preferring the lower point value items (e.g. A Cadbury creme egg is 11pts, 2 Bliss Mallow bars and a bliss cherry bakewell whip bar is also 11 points (2x 3pts and 1x 5pts). That's a rewarding swap and often I don't end up actually consuming all the lower point items in one go, but keep them handy for when I'm feeling snackish. I'm down nearly a stone so it's clearly working.\n\nMy point is, by denying yourself any exposure to treats, you increase the dopamine reward when you do get them, leading to craving and binges. So have a cookie, cut it in half and give him half. Or cut it into 4 and eat 1/4, wait an hour, eat another 1/4 etc. I'll bet money you forget about half of it and giving yourself a time gate isn't outright denial, it gives you a goal to look forward to, and achieving it is also a dopamine boost. Or give yourself arbitrary rewards 'if I clean the bathroom, I'll have a piece of chocolate, then I'll walk the dog and have another piece when I get home' etc. Obviously I don't need to point out that this is not the right approach for your alcohol journey and I wouldn't presume to comment on that. All I can share is my own experiences with snacks and treats because I have difficulties with food myself.", "[deleted]", "YTA. You clearly need to exercise self control.", "NTA because you\u2019re trying to avoid temptation and asking him to hide his snacks helps that but at the same time YTA because like he said, you should have more self control as he\u2019s not the one forcing you to eat it at the end of the day", "NTA.

They should be planning to tackle this issue too, but lack of self-control isn't the driving factor.", "I would feel like an animal if I had to hide my food from my partner.", "Hiding them isn't helping. They need to be out and visible so OP can learn self control. You never gain improvement if you are never subjected to challange. Hiding the snacks would literally be blocking OPs chance to self improve and gain control of her eating habits.", "Wtf is wrong with you.  You go from snacks to sexual assault.  You need some help if that\u2019s how your brains are scrambled.", "A very good point. Self-control is a finite resource and we need to use it wisely.", ">Have some self control\n\nIt's easy to say. But sugar addiction is a real addiction. You wouldn't wave drugs in front of a drug addict and say \"cmon have self control\". You would try to help him. \n\nI think if BF really cared abt OP they could figure something out. Instead of just shrugging it off and saying deal with it.", "BF is definitely an AH.", "This is hilarious, I'm laughing so hard", "Yah, for the same reasons as above", "Alcohol is a literal drug that people get addicted to\n\nCookies...not so much.", "I didn\u2019t say it was unreasonable. Just ultimately pointless in the long run.", "If the hiding place isn't good enough is it BF's fault? He lives there too so shouldn't he be allowed to use the kitchen area to store his snacks?", ">lack of self-control isn't the driving factor.\n\nI mean, it kind of is, though? Addiction and overeating are both behavioral problems, and the ultimate goal of treatment is to change the behaviors. \"Trying harder\" is an awful lot of both recovery and weight loss. \n\nOP is acting like she can't \\_help\\_ eating junk food, but she can--it's just hard. It would be cool and helpful of her partner to hide the food, but if he doesn't and she eats it, it will be her responsibility and not his.", "Keeping junk out of sight with easier access to healthier snacks to help a partner with their weight when they are struggling and ask for this help just seems like basic decency to me.", "My wife is on a diet so I have a bin of candy that I keep in my (home) office because she didn't want to ask me to not have candy in the house entirely but she has an easier time controlling her eating when the candy isn't in plain sight (she knows where the bin is, she could go grab some if she wanted).  \n\nIt comes down to the fact that I love my wife more than I love chocolate so I'm happy to help.", "Would you be saying this about alcohol?", "Exactly.\n\nHis saying to her \u201cyou need to have self-control\u201d is blaming her. She DOES have self-control. The form she uses is NOT making those purchases. He\u2019s trying to make her feel like it\u2019s her fault for not being \u201cbetter\u201d but really it\u2019s his fault for not respecting her boundaries and needs", "Actually people absolutely get addicted to food, particularly sugary foods.", "For some people it is. Look at the rates of heart disease. It\u2019s really just the same idea but it takes longer to notice", "People can be addicted to things that aren't drugs. Collectors are addicted to the item or series they collect, adrenaline junkies are addicted to the rush, hell social media influences are addicted to followers counts and algorithms.", "Sugar is a drug", ">but really it\u2019s his fault for not respecting her boundaries and needs\n\nYour very confused. A boundry is personal, she doesn't get to have a boundry of hidden snacks that affect him. Her boundry could be she will not live in a home where there are visible snacks and then leave if she is unhappy he has them, but in no way, shape, or form does she get to decide that snacks can't be visible in his home.", "Yeah being stubborn and inflexible is not  conducive to being in a relationship. What you seem to be missing is that you\u2019re \u201cgiving up autonomy\u201d for connection and support. If it\u2019s a positive relationship you gain more than you give up. Maybe not every day or in every decision, but in the grand scheme of things."]}
