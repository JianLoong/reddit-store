I do this for my mother who is constantly on a (not very successful) diet, the sweets and chocolate go in the sweets and chocolate box, which lives in my room. You want a key to open the sweets and chocolate box.\n\nI do this because I care that she's trying to make a change, and want to help her in that, and because she specifically asked me to. It's honestly a very small ask.", "NTA. Congratulations on your progress! Unfortunately if you have an addictive personality it's really easy to substitute one vice for another and it's not unreasonable to ask your BF to support your journey by being discrete with his snacks or other things. However there is a limit to how discrete it's possible to be with food items. If he was leaving alcohol on display then I'd say there was a larger issue, but junk food is just something that is common to have in your home and it's his home too.\n\nYou're NTA for asking, but I do also see his perspective. Perhaps a compromise? Maybe buy an opaque storage box that fits in a cupboard and ask him to keep the 'treats' in it? That way they're out of sight but still accessible for him?\n\nI saw a tiktok video earlier this week by Ben Carpenter @bdccarpenter discussing how outright denial or complete restriction of a treat item increases the dopamine payoff and increases the craving when you allow yourself a treat, whereas if you expose yourself to a treat item regularly, it manages the dopamine payoff and prevents binging. He has some source data (he admits the data is slim though) and it's worth a look.\n\nI've been on WW (weight watchers) and it's haaaarrrrd. So hard. But my husband and I work around the restrictions by sharing treat items. E.g. If we go somewhere for a coffee, we share a cake or muffin instead of having 1 each. I substitute high point items for equivalent point value in lower point items - it gives me more for my 'money' so boosts the dopamine reward and fools my brain into preferring the lower point value items (e.g. A Cadbury creme egg is 11pts, 2 Bliss Mallow bars and a bliss cherry bakewell whip bar is also 11 points (2x 3pts and 1x 5pts). That's a rewarding swap and often I don't end up actually consuming all the lower point items in one go, but keep them handy for when I'm feeling snackish. I'm down nearly a stone so it's clearly working.\n\nMy point is, by denying yourself any exposure to treats, you increase the dopamine reward when you do get them, leading to craving and binges. So have a cookie, cut it in half and give him half. Or cut it into 4 and eat 1/4, wait an hour, eat another 1/4 etc. I'll bet money you forget about half of it and giving yourself a time gate isn't outright denial, it gives you a goal to look forward to, and achieving it is also a dopamine boost. Or give yourself arbitrary rewards 'if I clean the bathroom, I'll have a piece of chocolate, then I'll walk the dog and have another piece when I get home' etc. Obviously I don't need to point out that this is not the right approach for your alcohol journey and I wouldn't presume to comment on that. All I can share is my own experiences with snacks and treats because I have difficulties with food myself.", "[deleted]", "YTA. You clearly need to exercise self control.", "NTA because you\u2019re trying to avoid temptation and asking him to hide his snacks helps that but at the same time YTA because like he said, you should have more self control as he\u2019s not the one forcing you to eat it at the end of the day", "NTA.

As far as I understand from existing research, no it  does not necessarily run out every day with use.

Some also argue if it doesn\u2019t require that finite mental focus can it really be called self-control. \n\nSelf-control is absolutely not infinite either way. It is finite the sense that individuals only have so much of it and cannot conjure self-control or any executive functioning abilities out of thin air. Everyone is different in how much self-control they are capable of and while it\u2019s possible to improve certain aspects and prioritize certain ta of control, humans absolutely can run out and have lapses when we\u2019re trying to do too many things at once.

They want things to be clean and they feel bad about the mess but they can\u2019t seem to pull themselves out of their funk and do it. It\u2019s a common symptom. Attitudes and motivation around diet exercise are often similarly complicated and tied to things like mental health as well as other physiological conditions (ie, conditions that make it harder to feel sated or make exercise more painful). The truth is that people don\u2019t just do what they want to do. If that were true everyone who wanted to be a skinny gym rat would just go be one.

OP didn\u2019t say NOT to bring them home.. just asked that they be stored out of sight. Not that hard to do that. Plus replace food with alcohol in this example.

The cookies are kept inside a bin now and the kids literally forget they exist.", "Congratulations on your sobriety :)\n\nI would be more than happy to accommodate someone I care about by keeping certain snacks put away if it was important to them. I would do, and have done, more difficult things to help someone I barely know.\n\nI can respect that your stance is different, but stand by my own view that OP's ask was reasonable, and it sucks that her partner is not willing to do a small adjustment to make her life more simple.", "100% this. I\u2019d never agree to hide snacks since I\u2019ll have to access them, and I won\u2019t be stealthy every time.

I'm not saying addicts are bad people, or worse people than nonaddicts. I'm saying recovery requires the development of moral virtues, and addiction--because it's behavioral--always includes moral frailties. \n\nStep 4 is for all the fucked up things you did _ever_, not just from the addiction, at least as I was taught it.

Besides, the mentality of hiding it may not help. Speaking as someone who had to do an elimination diet for months, it was so difficult. Asking him to keep them tucked out of sight is a good idea, but not to sneak them in where he lives. You will eventually figure out where they are and eat them. And then it's a grumpy cycle.\n\nUnfortunately it just comes to self control, which is a huge struggle but look at it this way: you are already *killing* it with being sober. Don't be so hard on yourself!\n\nAnd it might be worth looking into the sugar vs alcohol relation. Either through your doctor or some research.", "Honestly, NTA. Its valid for you to want to keep your weight where you are comfortable, especially if its food you guys didn't buy together (not saying every couple had to grocery shop together, but I know when family brings food home, it can be tempting to eat especially if its already open. Also it is very hard to gain self control in something that is a necessity like eating. I probably worded everything weird but, NTA, he should be respecting your boundaries", "YTA. He shouldn\u2019t be made to control his diet because YOU have addictions.", "Congrats on your sobriety.  Addiction is a sensitive topic and is on-going, so yes, the 'work never ends'.

Your partner putting snacks somewhere out of sight is not the world stopping turning my dude.

Stop twisting my sentences. And hiding bag of snacks because someone cant control themselves around them is exactly the same argument as men telling women to cover up their body so it doesnt arouse them. No one has the right to dictate others actions just because they cant control themselves.

Thats not cool and quite frankly you\u2019re the one who needs to get a grip.", "do you really think putting snacks somewhere out of sight is a ridiculous ask?

And equating it to the level of asking a woman to cover up is completely unreasonable (which, for the record, I do not support. Women should wear what they want). \n\nNot to mention, they're living together in a relationship. A true partner would want to help the other person with their struggles.

Once your brain chemicals have been affected by an addiction, it takes time, from weeks to YEARS, for them to get back to normal. During that time a person is more susceptible to other addictions. Food addictions are really difficult to manage because you CAN\u2019T just quit, and problematic foods are EVERYWHERE.\nPerhaps you could try comparing your issues with alcohol to your issues with calorie dense foods?

I agree with other commenter you can't compare this two situations. \n\nAnd if you want to compare she is not telling everyone on the street to hide their junk food, she's asking her bf.
