This is about you and your control. Congrats on losing the weight but it seems more like your issue not his.", "NAH. \nYou can ask. And he can say no. Have some self control. This is the exact same argument as people telling women to wear less revealing clothes so they dont arouse men. The solution is self control. Others should not have to change just because you cant control your own body.", "NAH. I asked my partner to \"hide\" the chips from me and he was fine with it.

Congratulations on your sobriety!", "NTA, I do the same for my boyfriend. I have that intense craving every now and then and need something sweet to still it.

It sounds like you've made great progress. I think hiding the naughty snacks somewhere is a very small ask. You will eventually get over the sugar cravings and find healthier snack habits. It just takes time.", "NTA - kind of makes sense and its a simple request.", "NTA: Yay you for all you've accomplished.  It's easy to swap one addiction for another and sugar is a super addictive substance. \n\nDoes he support your quitting alcohol and understand how hard that is? If so, he should be able to transfer that empathy to this.", "NTA. I have a family member who has requested the same thing. She honestly doesn\u2019t have the willpower and admits it. \n She\u2019ll ask me to put her favourite things \u201cout of her sight\u201d Diabetics runs in our family so I get it. I used to get annoyed and wonder why she just didn\u2019t use more self discipline but now I understand. It\u2019s not an unreasonable request. It won\u2019t kill him to accommodate you in this way.", "NTA. What's so hard for him about finding a stash spot for his treats? If he was able to support you through getting sober (congrats btw!) he should be able to support you with this as well. And, yes, as others have said you could work on self control around these things, but I totally get it. I struggle with my weight and have terrible self control sometimes and when I'm serious about losing weight I HAVE to eliminate all temptation by just not having those things around. I hope he comes around on this because it's not a big ask but would obviously be a big help to you. Sounds to me like he's being lazy/selfish.", "YTA.\n\nYour lack of self control is a you problem that you need to deal with, not expect others to make accommodations for.", "NTA. I have no self control and binging issues. I let my roommate know in advanced and told her she may have to hide certain foods. \n\nOne method of self-control is eliminating temptation. You have self-control when you make purchases so you don\u2019t have to face needing that self-control at home. He\u2019s not ignoring what you need to have self-control and then blaming you for it and making your life harder. He\u2019s a jerk.", "YTA - This is a pointless and doomed strategy that puts the onus of your eating disorder on him. You need to be managing your relationship with food, not drawing your partner into a game of hide and seek.", "YTA learn some self control he shouldn't have to hide his food ever. Unless it's an allergy it's all on you.", "YTA So he has to dig through the back of a closet/drawer to get his snacks? It\u2019s not his fault you lack self control and he should feel comfortable in his own home. I would feel like an animal if I had to hide my food from my partner.", "OP, get tested for diabetes.", "NTA.\n\nOne of the best tips to lose weight is not having junk food in the house. You cant eat something that's not there. So if he insists on having it in the house he should at least not make it visible.", "NTA. It\u2019s a pretty simple ask. He should do it because *wants* to help you succeed.", "NTA\n\nYou are asking him to respect your choices. Well done on quitting drinking, I'm proud of you for that. But yeah, he needs to support you in the way you have asked.", "NTA. This is a minimal request and he\u2019s being childish. It\u2019s rich telling you to have more self-control when you\u2019re beating alcohol addiction.\n\nThat said: you lost 80 lbs! That\u2019s great! Don\u2019t beat yourself up for eating cookies once in a while.", "Yta", "NTA.\n\nYou could have more self control for sure but you asking for this is a way of admitting that you struggle with a certain thing and asking for help, which a supportive partner should have no real trouble doing given it's such a small ask. I do this for my mother who is constantly on a (not very successful) diet, the sweets and chocolate go in the sweets and chocolate box, which lives in my room. You want a key to open the sweets and chocolate box.\n\nI do this because I care that she's trying to make a change, and want to help her in that, and because she specifically asked me to. It's honestly a very small ask.", "NTA. Congratulations on your progress! Unfortunately if you have an addictive personality it's really easy to substitute one vice for another and it's not unreasonable to ask your BF to support your journey by being discrete with his snacks or other things. However there is a limit to how discrete it's possible to be with food items. If he was leaving alcohol on display then I'd say there was a larger issue, but junk food is just something that is common to have in your home and it's his home too.\n\nYou're NTA for asking, but I do also see his perspective. Perhaps a compromise? Maybe buy an opaque storage box that fits in a cupboard and ask him to keep the 'treats' in it? That way they're out of sight but still accessible for him?\n\nI saw a tiktok video earlier this week by Ben Carpenter @bdccarpenter discussing how outright denial or complete restriction of a treat item increases the dopamine payoff and increases the craving when you allow yourself a treat, whereas if you expose yourself to a treat item regularly, it manages the dopamine payoff and prevents binging. He has some source data (he admits the data is slim though) and it's worth a look.\n\nI've been on WW (weight watchers) and it's haaaarrrrd. So hard. But my husband and I work around the restrictions by sharing treat items. E.g. If we go somewhere for a coffee, we share a cake or muffin instead of having 1 each. I substitute high point items for equivalent point value in lower point items - it gives me more for my 'money' so boosts the dopamine reward and fools my brain into preferring the lower point value items (e.g. A Cadbury creme egg is 11pts, 2 Bliss Mallow bars and a bliss cherry bakewell whip bar is also 11 points (2x 3pts and 1x 5pts). That's a rewarding swap and often I don't end up actually consuming all the lower point items in one go, but keep them handy for when I'm feeling snackish. I'm down nearly a stone so it's clearly working.\n\nMy point is, by denying yourself any exposure to treats, you increase the dopamine reward when you do get them, leading to craving and binges. So have a cookie, cut it in half and give him half. Or cut it into 4 and eat 1/4, wait an hour, eat another 1/4 etc. I'll bet money you forget about half of it and giving yourself a time gate isn't outright denial, it gives you a goal to look forward to, and achieving it is also a dopamine boost. Or give yourself arbitrary rewards 'if I clean the bathroom, I'll have a piece of chocolate, then I'll walk the dog and have another piece when I get home' etc. Obviously I don't need to point out that this is not the right approach for your alcohol journey and I wouldn't presume to comment on that. All I can share is my own experiences with snacks and treats because I have difficulties with food myself.", "Nta but not a solution\u2026.\n\nIn essence youre just blaming others for your own action or behavior", "YTA. You clearly need to exercise self control.", "NTA because you\u2019re trying to avoid temptation and asking him to hide his snacks helps that but at the same time YTA because like he said, you should have more self control as he\u2019s not the one forcing you to eat it at the end of the day", "NTA. He should want to support you in your efforts. Temptation is easier to beat when it's out of sight. You aren't trying to stop him eating his snacks, just to be supportive.", "NTA\n\nYou really should be proud of what you've overcome. It's not been easy and honestly it's not that much of an effort to hide junk food from you. If you don't have self-control, neither does he. If he did, he wouldn't buy these kind of stuff.  \nKeep it up with your good work!", "NTA. My situation is somewhat similar. My wife decided to be a vegetarian last August. My son and I are not vegetarian, but since I do all of the cooking, I pretty much leave meat out of my dishes for her. It\u2019s not going to hurt me or my son, and we can still have a little meat when we go out. \n\nTo summarize, making small sacrifices for the ones we love should be an expected and lauded practice.", "NTA\n\nI hide the cookies my husband can't resist and he hides the chocolate I can't resist that gives me migraines. This is a perfectly reasonable ask.", "Put his snacks in a cabinet and tape a big, embarrassing picture of yourself when you were 80lbs heavier in the cabinet door. That way everytime you want to sneak in and take one of his snacks, you have to come literally face-to-face with what you're trying to avoid. He may even subconsciously slow down on the snacks too.", "NTA. \n\nPartners should want to help one another with their goals and with improving their health/life quality in general. \n\nThis is a thin line to toe because it\u2019s important you aren\u2019t making it entirely his responsibility that you don\u2019t access junk food. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too far fetched to sit him down and explain that your rampant sweet tooth is just a by product of you becoming sober, and since it is newer to you, you aren\u2019t able to manage it all at once the way you would like. \n\nThen tell him you would really appreciate his help to continue improving these things for yourself, and you understand it\u2019s not his job nor do you want to keep him from doing things he enjoys so you\u2019re hoping the two of you can figure out a solution together. \n\nAsking your partner to put junk food where you won\u2019t see it is not too much to ask.", "NTA-out of sight out of mind.", "NTA, it\u2019s very simple to hide the food from you. He\u2019s being inconsiderate to bring stuff like that home. It would be sort of like someone who\u2019s pregnant watching their partner get drunk and eat sushi. Idk I\u2019m being dramatic but as someone who struggles with weight and self control sometimes hiding the food is all that can be done to not eat badly", "NTA, but you live together now so maybe sit down and make a common decision about your meal plan (which includes snacks) so you both can enjoy life. Maybe only snacks on weekends? Put it in a specific cabinet that is out of your reach? Ok, that doesn't always work, our kids are obviously training to be mountain climbers and are excellent at working together to get the crackers from the top cabinet. But it does at least slow them down a little bit.", "Cement it in your mind that those foods are HIS and not YOURS.

If you care for someone and want to be with them then you find a way and a common ground. \n\nIf your partner is lousy at self control, well, is it really that bad to hide the things they crave? Or maybe agree to not eat it every day so they won't get tempted? OP didn't ask her partner to give up snacks all together, just to hide it better from her. Which IS a reasonable request.
