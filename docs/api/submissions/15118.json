Are there so few options for apartments in your area? This just sounds like a miserable place to live so idk why to try and make it work rather than move.", "NTA.  File the complaint.  You would be doing him a favor since the building will degrade over time without maintenance.", "I am a person who has a condition called prosopagnosia, which made it hard for me to be successful in my chosen profession- teaching. So what did I do? I changed what I did. I started teaching online. I sure as hell did not just say ''sorry kids, I am sick so you can get rekt.''\n\nYour landlord needs to do a job he can do.

Track all aspects of your complaint and respond quickly and thoroughly.", "NTA, but rather strange for having lived in this type of place for so long.\n\nDon't bother telling the landlord, just go to the housing board. However, make sure that he can't legally use it against you to evict you, but still have a backup plan for alternate housing. You may also need a place to stay during renos. Get all the legalities together regarding your rights and obligations as a tenant and learn about those for landlords. It's important that you know where the situation stands. Considering the condition of your apartment, I have a feeling your landlord either has no clear idea of his obligations or he does and is actively refusing to comply. That too will have to be teased out.\n\nDon't be surprised if you get a hefty rent increase proportional to the renos done, that is if they get done.\n\nGood luck", "NTA do it", "NTA. He has a contractual obligation to provide rental premises that meet the terms of the contract. Additionally, he is responsible for upkeep and repairs to maintain a safe living environment. Mold could be deadly. Water could cause property damage. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate he\u2019s ill, but in that case he should find a property manager or some other arrangement to make sure he can fulfill his duties as a landlord. \n\nI would make sure to keep it professional and just mention the lack of maintenance and things he\u2019s told you that suggest he no longer has the ability to fulfill and perform the required upkeep and maintenance. Say that unless he commits to fixing these issues in a timely manner to prevent potential health concerns or property damage, you\u2019ll unfortunately have no other choice but to seek help outside of this landlord/tenant relationship. \n\nDocument, document, document.

If nothing has changed in 15 years it won't change now. He may sell the building (sounds like it needs to be condemned) if presented with a huge maintenance obligation. I'd be ready to move in general regardless of the outcome as he may find a reason to evict if you complain. I know you mentioned rent control as a reason to stay but by the state of the place it sounds like your health may not tolerate you staying.", "NTA.  You are living in a toxic waste dump, not an apartment.  Make sure you have documentation of the conditions, your complaints to him and his responses.  Good luck.", "NTA", "NTA. You both are accountable in the contract of renting. He isn't holding up his end and so, you were forced to make claims against him. Mold, mildew and fungus? Property destroyed and not replaced? Uh un. That's unhealthy as well as plain nasty. Raining in your apartment? The apartment isn't habitable as it is and you are paying to be treated poorly.", "He's had years to maintain the apartment which he didn't do. That has nothing to do with his illness.\n\nIf he doesn't pay for for someone to fix these problems, you're in your right to file a complaint.\n\nAlso, he never felt sorry for his paying tenant to live in a dump.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nThat said, I think first I would talk to your super along the lines of, \"I\u2019m terribly sorry for what you\u2019re physically going through.

I'd go one step further, since I've had landlords like him: **he's saying this to make you feel guilty**. Stop being guilty.  Do what you need to as if he had never told you that hint about his health problems at all.

He chose to become a landlord, he accepts your money for doing nothing and contributing nothing to society.

Not to mention that money that you are spending yourself on fixing these problems could also be put to finding a better place that will fix these issues.", "[deleted]", "My pleasure.\n\nI had a landlord who one year was planning on landscaping the front garden and decided to increase the rent before doing anything. You can be sure that I swiftly refused to sign for that increase. I contacted the housing board and the confirmed that a rent cannot be increased in anticipation of a project and outdoor landscaping cannot be counted into a rent increase. Every year I would calculate what kind of increase should be applied by seeing if school and municipal taxes had increased and by how much, then applied that against my portion of the building. The housing board would also publish ballparks for rent increases depending if you paid for amenities separately or if it was included in the rent. With that info detailed in a counter offer letter, he always accepted and never countered my counter. I managed to keep my rent very reasonable over many years.", "[deleted]", "I get that, but you might have no other option. Is it bad enough it could be condemned?", "Which kind of sucks because there's no middle ground between the person who takes care of your digs and the law. Still though, I suggest super kindness, maybe with the inference that he could find someone to fix the issue, so you didn\u2019t have to call services, coated in caring, it could help.  And if not, you know, for sure, you tried everything possible before doing so. There can be no guilt in that.", "Ah. Ok, I understand escrow now. \n\n Where I live we have a city agency for rent protection. And no worries on the lease renewal. Here everyone goes month to month after their initial lease expires. Thank you for your advice.", ">With all due respect, is your career worth it \n\nYes. The city is expensive. You have to be making $200K to be of average wage here. I am far below that.
