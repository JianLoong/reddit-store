Its 116 years old.  Ive been in my apartment for 15+ years and in that time, nothing has been upgraded, its a complete dump, and even worse, no regular building maintenance has occurred. \n\nMy landlord never fixes anything. If I dont fix things on my own, they will not get fixed.  I went almost 10 years with windows that were falling apart from dry rot, waiting for him to fix them. I finally took rent money and paid someone to fix them. \n\nCurrently, it is raining in my kitchen. There is water coming in through the ceiling in one spot. One of the bedrooms is also unusable because there is a water leak so bad, fungus is growing on the wall inside. Ive been telling the landlord since January about these leaks and the only response I get is \"Im sick, be patient.\"\n\nAbout 1 year ago, he was diagnosed with a \"blood disease\". This is all I know. We are not friends, we've had a pretty terrible relationship due to his being consistently difficult over the years regarding maintenance and other illegal things he has done. (Throwing away everything stored in the basement, clear cutting the yard and throwing away furniture and plants for no reason and with zero notice).\n\nI want it to stop raining in my apartment. \n\nThe city I live in has very good renter protection, and if I filed a complaint with the city, its very likely they would make him give me a monetary settlement.\n\nIm tired of being \"patient\" when I have fungus growing in a bedroom. We have a business relationship, and Ive never stopped paying rent, yet he does nothing. No property manager or anyone to do anything, ever.\n\nSo WIBTA if I told him Im tired of his lack of care and Im going to the city to file a complaint because enough is enough? If hes too sick to take care of his building, he needs to hire someone. His illness is not my problem.\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone for helping me see that I WNBTA. Im probably not going to reply to anymore  comments. Check my post history if you have a question, Ive probably answered it.\n\nIm not going to post to r /legaladvice.

I cannot afford that.\n\nTry to get a consultation with a local lawyer to discuss options.  If you file a formal complaint with the condition the property is in now the city may declare it uninhabitable and require you to move out immediately.\n\nOn the other hand, you may be able to do something like put your rent into a separate savings account and send your landlord notice that you're withholding rent until the unit meets the rules for habitability.   That's more likely to get the result you actually want: your landlord fixing the problems and you continuing to live there.", "If someone actually told you that you should live with mold and rain in your kitchen because your landlord has health problems, would you actually do that? \n\nTo be clear, I'm not telling you that you should put up with mold and rain. My advice is to get a lawyer. But, if everyone told you to put up with it because he's old and he has worse problems than you, could you actually believe that?", "I assumed something like this. No other reason to stay in the same rental for 15 years", "By fungus\u2026 do you mean the highly toxic and very dangerous BLACK MOLD????\n\nYour landlord should have hired a super as soon as he got sick and he was incapacitated to fulfill the maintenance and upkeep of the property, as per the rental agreements.\n\nYWNBTA.  In fact, I\u2019d highly encourage you to contact other long-term tenants to do the same.", "Omg grow a spine and file the complaint", "NTA you shouldn't be paying rent", "Nta but you should leave. At this point if there\u2019s mold growing in the walls it can make you extremely ill. What\u2019s worse is mold spores can infect all your belongings and be almost impossible to remove from porous materials like bedding and furniture. Mold made from water-damaged buildings make potent Mycotoxins, some of which are carcinogenic. Its worth it to leave, trash your belongings and sue for the damages. At this point id be taking extensive photos, contacting your local health department. Your landlord is probably sick from chronic mold exposure himself.", "File the complaint but don't be surprised if he puts you on a month to month and terminates your lease in the near future.", "YWBTA He wouldn't give a shit if you had a blood disease, if you couldn't pay rent.", "No, by fungus I mean actual mushrooms growing off the wall.", "Well he doesnt live in the building, so doubt hes sick from the mold. The rst of what you wrote is interesting, i didnt know that about the spores.", "I am on month to month, for 14 years now, and a landlord in my city cant kick someone out just they want to. There is no terminating leases to get someone out here.", "OMG, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse.  There\u2019s a huge probability that the fungus is in the walls, which means there\u2019s a ton of mold.  Regardless, PLEASE do not sleep in your bedroom anymore!!!\n\nMushroom spores can cause a host of issues; irreparable and chronic damage to your lungs, with a specific condition called hypersensitivity pneumonitis, as well as allergic bronchopulmonary mycoses. You literally would need a biopsy to tell the extent of damage, and if exposed long enough, you could be on anti-inflammatory meds for the rest of your life.  It can also cause sinus issues, asthma, and trigger autoimmune disorders\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing any of these things, get checked out ASAP.", "Yep, personally destroyed my health so I know firsthand how toxic it can be.", "Exactly, my husband and I lived in a place that had leaks and mold growing.  He was treated with 4 different antibiotics before the Dr figured it was the mold in our home that was making him sick.  He also started having mini strokes shortly after the diagnosis was made, I don't know if that was related or just coincidence.  But I'm sure that living with the mold shortened his life.", "Thank you. For the record, its not the bedroom I sleep in. Its just a spare empty room, because I dont have a roommate right now. I appreciate your tips to watch out for health wise.", "Where do you live? San Francisco??", "Can you not just move into one of those?", "Id probably have to sign a new lease and the rent would start at todays rate. Plus they are basement apartments that are horrible and dark.", "Have you considered New Mexico? It's liberal, cheap, multicultural, naturally beautiful.  CA is great but man that cost of living is fucking brutal there.", "No water. Thats going to be a huge problem in the not too distant future. Also a right to work/anti-labor state.", "\n> (Especially given the current political situation and the ever-increasing restrictions on reproductive rights and queer/trans rights at the state level, many people need to think very carefully about whether it's even safe for them to move to certain other states.)\n\nYeah,  I wouldn't necessarily suggest a trans person move to the Florida panhandle. \n\nBut there's plenty of affordable liberal cities in blue states.   You don't have to live in Boston, Manhattan, or in San Fran.\n\nOP mentioned not liking winter, but if you can stand a bit of snow than Buffalo and Rochester are both LGBT friendly and far, far cheaper than NYC.  Burlington Vermont is smaller but still very lgbt friendly.   Worcester is a fraction the cost of Boston.

You may want to start thinking about saving some money and finding alternative living arrangements just in case as a back up. Cali is expensive as all hell,  and most people need 6-8 people in a 2 bed room apartment to make the rent there.  Just some food for thought.", "I mean, unless New England got mentioned and I missed it, I'm not sure how that's relevant?
