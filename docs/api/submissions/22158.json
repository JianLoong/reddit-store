It is unfair to your wife. She deserves time with her friends and family.", "I get that but i dont buy the family uber alles and ill explain why:\n\nMy mom sees us for 2-3 months of the year. My brother and sister married into the same family and they are not nice people. My brother divorced but with covid and a controlling ex family, he never gets to take his kids anywhere. His family in fact knew we were coming to their country monthsbin advance, and changed their plans to leave just days before we arrive on purpose.\n\nPlus my mom is a very difficult woman who always wants sto be put first no matter what. And we accommodate the hell out of her for 3 months of the year. This is the one break we get, and my wifes best friend spent her limited time and money to come see us. We spent ages going back and forth to find a compromise that worked for everyone, and the result is they come here for five days, and instead of the original five day holiday we had planned, we would go see my brother and my mom in his country for 5 days.\n\nOur friend is important to us. Her and her husband love our daughter and are family in all but name. I think its important that they get to spend that time with my wife and daughter too. My family is coming on the exact dates that they are here and we have already decided my family gets the full weekend with us and one day this coming week. Thats 3 of the 5 days. How much more are we expected to compromise?", "Congrats on sticking to the boundaries.  Everyone will learn from this that you mean what you say.\n\nI am sure Mom thought she was specia, and deserved special treatment  meaning your boundaries don't include her.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your mom agreed to your expectations, then set about trying to change everything to what best suit her needs. Here's the clue, when people call you selfish for enforcing a boundary, they're projecting.\n\nYour mom is completely correct, family is more important. And, for you, your wife and child are your family. They are what is important in your life now. Protect that. Especially from other meddling family.", "NTA   I wouldn't waste time seeing my mother (and definitely wouldn't allow her around my spouse and children) if she behaved like this.   I'd cut her off and move on with life.  Hold firm with your boundaries.  She'll either figure it out, or she won't and you can move on and away with peace."]}
