It's amazing how few people have them, but as soon as they get one, it changes their life. I bought my brother one for Christmas (and a cast iron pan) because he was cooking for two and wanted to practice more. A year and a bit later and his steaks are coming out beautifully and his chicken is... I'd give it a B+ on a bad day.", "NTA. I WOULD however like to comment on the nature of everyone on Reddit saying OP\u2019s need a divorce every time for EVERY scenario. No you shouldn\u2019t fuckin DIVORCE your dang husband over this. That\u2019s patently absurd.\n\nHOWEVER\u2026.. your SIL is a childish person and clearly a mooch. If she sometimes did the cooking instead if you to make your lives easier that would be one thing. But from what you described it seems like she\u2019s just being an arrogant AH who seems entitled to living with you and doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s a (conditional) guest in your home. Only someone with zero fear of consequences would do what she\u2019s been doing. My wife doesn\u2019t love cooking (although she\u2019s not bad at it at all) but I primarily do the cooking in our house and if her brother or one of my siblings did this repeatedly to me, I\u2019d lose my f@@@ing shit at them and chase them out with a rolling pin like our Ma used to do with us lol.\nYou need to sit down with your SIL and tell her that she needs to respect your home and that she is a GUEST in your home. That she can be removed whenever you want, and that she cannot simply do what she pleases Willy nilly in your house. If you\u2019re cooking, then she stays out of the frickin kitchen. That as a guest she needs to abide by the rules in your home or she will not be allowed to live with you any more. She can think you\u2019re overreacting all she wants, but thems the rules and if she can\u2019t follow \u2018em then she needs to look for somewhere else to live. That she is being incredibly disrespectful after you took her into your home, and that being family doesn\u2019t inherently entitle you to be given a place to stay. If she tries to brush it off, snap in her damn face to get her attention and tell her this isn\u2019t a game and if she wants to live with you and be treated like an adult, then she needs to act like one and show some responsibility and accountability. \n\nI would also like to know why she\u2019s living with you. Not any serious specifics, and I do totally get that sometimes people are down on their luck, are disabled/unable to work or live alone, or are going through a transitional period and need some help. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m wondering about\u2026. I\u2019m asking this because I know a couple people in my family who asked to live with other relatives \u201cuntil they were back on their feet\u201d and then moved in and became mooches and never got a job and never left. Two of the three people I know that did this have since been kicked out  because the home owners realized eventually that they were being taken advantage of. If this is what your SIL is doing, then she needs to be kicked out YESTERDAY. Especially if she\u2019s pulling this bull@@@t with the food to boot. \n\nAs for your hubby, you should probably have a convo with him as well. Tell him that when you\u2019re cooking it\u2019s your damn kitchen. And if he wants to do all the cooking, then you\u2019ll gladly step back and let him struggle through doing it all by himself. You should also make it clear to him that if he doesn\u2019t LIKE your cooking you don\u2019t have to cook for him ever again, and you can always just cook for you and your children and leave him to fend for himself culinarily. Tell him he\u2019s being incredibly disrespectful and acting like a child. And if he brushes you off, put that line in the sand and stop cooking for him for a month. See how quick he\u2019ll make an about-face after that. If it\u2019s REALLY bad then yes, maybe a couples counseling sesh or two. But make it clear that the cooking is the primary issue, if that\u2019s the only big issue. \n\nAlso\u2026.. who the F@@@ puts frickin SUGAR in spaghet?!!?! What kind of friggin monster does this? That is absolute sacrilege. That\u2019s nothing short of culinary terrorism", "You don't have to feel sorry about what she did because she has the right to do. Her sister in law and her husband as just making something a big issue here", "She's the only of the house but she must feel obliged to let her sister and law to do anything she wants. I wonder that they are siblings", "She have to cook for her kids not for anyone else. Didn't want the food that you go that's why they had something that they would like. I would definitely be mad", "If they have pets the air horns are a bad idea. It would scare them. \n\nWhat she needs to do is kick the freeloading SIL out.", "I get my teenager up and out the door to school every morning, including making him breakfast. Sometimes he's grouchy and gets a fresh mouth on him. I go on strike regularly so that he has to make his own breakfast, and it (re)reminds him of how good he has it. It also somewhat prepares him for adulthood\n\nEdit: typo", "I think the OP nothing is not strict with the rules of the house. She just let her sister-in-law to ruin and maybe she let her to do that. Just because she's the sister", "This is what I hate. I had a roommate who would never try my cooking before smothering it in tomato sauce and salt and pepper, EVEN SPAGHETTI BOLOGNASE where I put in so much tomato it gives me heart burn some nights, all it needs is parmesan and damn it tastes good but not to him", "She knew that her wife doesn't i like it. But they are still doing the same even her wife doesn't want to", "It's nice in a pinch and generally preferable to tuna for most people. I personally don't buy it but I don't hate it.  I often make a whole chicken and put it all in the fridge, with the sole intention of using it in different dinners throughout the week. If you don't have the desire or time to spend cooking it just for the leftovers, canned stuff will work fine.", "I use it for a chicken noodle casserole recipe every once in awhile and it\u2019s good for chicken salad, but putting it in homemade mac & cheese is a crime against food.", "Getting a kick out of ruining your kids food is disgusting. Definitely something wrong with the husband's head", "Your mum is great for standing with your dad's boundaries and rules. OP has to set some similar rules and make sure the husband follows it.", "She was sabotage the food that was practically for the kids alone. She don't have to tease her husband and sister-in-law", "They prefer that kind of food but the owner don't want it specially the kids. They're just making decisions that everyone don't want to. They where too disrespectful", "Diary of a Mad Black Woman"]}
