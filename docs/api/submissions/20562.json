For what reason, I couldn\u2019t say, but they are absolutely getting something out of deliberately pissing her off and ruining the food.", "If she goes this route, I'd make hers and the kids plate first, then over-salt or whatever.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t mean to sound like I was criticizing your comment\u2026basically just agreeing with you and expounding on what they should do if that is why they are doing it.", "Oh please, because that comment could mean lots of other things, right? Don\u2019t be disingenuous.", "Right, because that sentence is so subtle, right? Come on.", "Right, sure, that\u2019s super believable.", "who TF wants blue cheese in their burgers lol. fair if they do, but 1 i personally find that gross, and 2 thatd be NASTY if you didnt expect it. youd think your food went bad xD", "I am here for this pedantry.", "But only if the bear is able.", "Outstanding", "Wanted to give you an award but I'm not paying shit for reddit so take this cookie \ud83c\udf6a", "\ud83c\udfc6please accept my poor woman\u2019s award", "Unfounded grammar doctoring = annoying / unbearable \n\nCorrecting notable grammar/spelling errors = a breath of fresh air/ occasionally necessary for legibility", "noooooo", "Ehhhhh! Saw what you did there!", "Uff da. I see what you did. I like it and hate it soooo much.", "Well as long as we are policing grammar I thought \u201cirregardless\u201d was not a word? Regardless would be the appropriate word. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong (seriously please correct me. Not sarcasm)", "you got busted by grammar police internal affairs", "I am also an English teacher, and I absolutely DO NOT correct grammar outside of my classroom. It's both douchy and pedantic.", "Is it more cost-effective for sil to waste the food OP is actively preparing? Probably not, and her and her kids at least get to eat in peace.", "To be fair, SIL repeated sabotaging food isn't exactly cost effective either", "Considering they are basically wasting food with their edits to the meal. Going out probably evens out for OP.", "The sister is the source of it. He's just joining in the \"fun\" with his stupid sister. Get rid of her and it'll stop.", "It's little. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Definitely entertaining.  Maybe it is the same SIL and she is doing it with two families, LOL.", "Right? I like to use fresh basil if I want to add a pinch of sweetness and zest.", "Carrots for sweetness, potatoes to cut the acidity. Rosamaria Bonitati original recipe.", "Balsamic vinegar can also add \u2018sweetness\u2019 cut the acidity & gives it a nice flavour. Again though the key is only a little", "Reminds me of the candy spaghetti from the movie elf \ud83e\udd2e", "My Italian aunt is the reason I put sugar in my sauce. But only a spoon for a 15 qt pot, not 2 cups. That's insane.", "My grandma (Ohio, US) used a bit of sugar also. She probably read about it somewhere like Heloise lol.", "I always forget that I can use carrots instead of refined sugar for savory dishes, thanks for the reminder!", "Could be Jenga for all you know......or even worse, just in general helping sister make things harder for OP around the house. That's where MY mind went with that comment, sister is probably using way too much detergent or not separating stuff or something bc it's how he grew up and husband is probably enabling/participating. What's wrong with YOU? Do you live in Alabama? Is yer sister yer mawma??\n\nETA: NTA OP. Kick her out and she can cook however she likes and invite brother over to eat it if they like. YOU cook for your children and know what they do and don't like. And if they don't like it, it just gets wasted. No need to waste food bc some weirdos wanna pretend to be master chefs. Who tf puts CANNED CHICKEN in HOMEMADE MAC AND CHEESE and BLEU CHEESE INTO BURGERS???? Freaks.", "well it seems like only YOUR mind went that way so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Lol I assure you it\u2019s a thing, and it\u2019s all personal preference.", "I don't see what ants' feet have to do with it.", "Seems like those people would be uneatable to the bear.", "Or bearable.

Consent is important.", "It\u2019s like having to guard your food from pets, only worse.", "SIL AND husband have overstayed their welcome", "NTA. The fact that your husband has joined in on this feels like they've teamed up against you. How about not making dinner? Maybe you can get takeout just for yourself and the kids for a week or so? Husband and SIL are not only insulting your cooking; they're turning your food into something the kids don't enjoy, either.", "Happy to see an uff da in the wild", "They used irregardless on purpose to wind up pedants. Whether it\u2019s a proper word depends on how prescriptivist you are about language use: it does now appear in a lot of [dictionaries](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/irregardless) but often flagged as informal/non-standard. Regardless is the standard form of the word.", "Now that I think about it, going on strike might be the best option. SIL and husband get to eat their abominations, and OP and their kids get to eat normal food.", "I was going to say...", "A grown man that can\u2019t control himself when it comes to childish peer pressure? Ick.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 yesssss. I can\u2019t imagine eating that.", "Yeah two cups is like a whole ass batch of cookies what is the thought process", "Definitely lose the sugar!", "Maybe they were just doing a game of thrones rewatch lol", "This is the funniest thing I've read in a very long time. I just hope I remember it the next time someone uses that word. \ud83d\ude02", "NICE", " Then when they ask 'what's for dinner' tell them they can have whatever dish they ruined. Then take your kiddos out to eat or have takeout ready for them.", "Barely bearable near.", "Agreed.
