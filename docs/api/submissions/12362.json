I\u2019ve encouraged him to get a job and an education over the years, but he\u2019s shown no interest. Recently, I have been offered a job at an international school overseas. The salary and benefits are currently far better than my current position in the U.S.\n\nMy son wanted to go with me overseas, but is too old to get a dependent visa. I told him this was an amazing opportunity  for me and he needed to start acting like an adult and get a job.

He\u2019s studying for the GED and almost ready to take it, has researched what type of work he wants to do,and the places he can work. He\u2019s even found apartments in the area that he can live in.\n\nI\u2019m going to help him pay for the move, pay the security deposit for his apartment, and give him enough extra for the first month until he gets paid before I leave. My sister lives nearby and can help him if he needs anything that can\u2019t be solved by calling me. She will also check on him periodically. Finally, he\u2019s been alone before when I\u2019ve been on vacation and has been fine. \n\nSo, am I selfish for taking this job? Im paycheck to paycheck now. The new job will give me some breathing space. What do you guys think?\n\nAlso, for those commenting. My son has a bank account which he pays for small bills he makes.

You are giving your son a chance to grow up and be independent. You have supported him for 22 years and now it's time for him to take responsibility for his own life.

He should be proud of himself and so should you.\n\nYou deserve this opportunity to advance your career and improve your financial situation. You have worked hard as a teacher and a single parent. Don't let your friends guilt-trip you into staying or taking your son with you overseas. They don't know what's best for you or your son. You do.\n\nYou are not abandoning your son. You are giving him a gift of independence and self-reliance. He will learn valuable skills and lessons that will serve him well in life.

I don't mean to be harsh, its just that expecting to have to solve his problems over the phone, having your sister check up on him, etc, shouldn't be necessary. The way you wrote about all this made me think he was developmenally disabled, or a young teenager. But apparently hes a normal 22 year old. \n\nYou can be there for him emotionally, but maybe encourage him to figure things out on his own. I know i did plenty of googling when I moved out. Not that I didn't ask my parents for advice, but I'm almost 30 and still searching shit like, \"do I need to use fabric softener\" most days. \n\nAlso, paying part of his rent is generous and not necessarily bad, but be careful not to subsidize him living above his means, you know? If he's not financially literate he might choose a place that you'll have to help pay for indefinitely.

Especially if the adult friends are on the sons side.    \nDont know many people who would be protective of someone else's 22 year old drop out son living at home unless something else is up.", "You\u2019re a teacher and you moved states and transferred your son to a school where his credits wouldn\u2019t transfer? NTA for having him go out on his own at this point but poor planning on his credits not transfer over. Of course he lost motivation.", ">joint work/ school program\n\nThis requires elaboration.  I'm all for kicking a failure to launch out of the nest but there's more to this.", "Why didnt he get his GED? And why do ur friends think he isnt ready?", "No mystery, lol. BOCES has a program where you can learn a skill while you earn credits to graduate. One program they offer is Culinary. He wanted to be a chef, so he enrolled in that program", "I did something similar in high school however I also still had other classes beyond it.  How is it that they wanted him back two full grades?", "Different state. Credits didn\u2019t transfer. Part of culinary was 1 math credit, 1 reading", "Why did your family move? Seems like that really messed him up. Not to be rude, but if I were literally a senior in high school and someone told me I'd have to do two more years, I'd go insane.", "I moved because I was taking care of my grandmother who had dementia. She passed. I was in a little town where I was substitute teaching making 90 dollars a day, gross. I moved to get a real tenure track teaching position.", "NTA\n\nThis will be an excellent opportunity for your son to grow up and become independent. Best luck on your new career opportunity.", "If the context were just a little different everybody would be calling you the asshole, but not this time! You get to go overseas! How exotic! YTA; you failed your kid by not preparing him\u2014crippling him infact, since you didn't like making a \"gross\" amount of money as a substitute teacher\u2014and now you're hanging him out to dry.", "Absolutely take the opportunity. Your son is an adult and is getting plenty of support as is. Seems like your move also pushed him to finally act. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA.  If your friends are so concerned then he can live with them.", "NTA.\nyou're making sure he's got a way to support himself, he's not being caught by surprise.", "INFO: where's the conflict? He's getting his GED, looking for jobs and an apartment.\n\nWhat's the problem here?", "Nta. This might be the push your son needs to be serious about his life and future. You've been responsible for him long enough. Time to follow your own desires.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, getting him out and independent is the best thing you could do for him. Your \"friends\" are assholes. Enjoy your new job, and DON'T let him move in on you overseas!!", "NTA. \n\nYou have an opportunity, and have no reason NOT to take it. \n\nYou'd do your slacker kid a disservice to stick around so he can live at home and do nothing, at your expense. \n\nIt seems like your son is already stepping up to partake of life and education and employment, so it sounds like it's already had some benefits. \n\nGo. Travel expands the mind and nourishes the soul.  Food, smells, sounds, culture etc. etc. \n\nGO!", "Thr problem here is that you postponed that kid independence but never too late to learn it give hom all the advice and guidance you possibly can before you leave he will surprise you showing how much of a grown up he is really capable of being. NTA", "While you\u2019re NTA for taking this new opportunity,  YTA for not doing very much to support your son after you moved the first time. All his credits from junior/senior didn\u2019t transfer and he lost all motivation. Did you do anything to address this, after you stopped paying for online school?\n\nYou did fail him back then, but I think all the steps you\u2018re taking now are the best thing for both of you.", "NTA\n\nSee what happens when he can't freeload off you? He has initiative! He has skills! You should have left years ago!", "NTA. \n\nYou have an opportunity, and have no reason NOT to take it. \n\nYou'd do your slacker kid a disservice to stick around so he can live at home and do nothing, at your expense. \n\nIt seems like your son is already stepping up to partake of life and education and employment, so it sounds like it's already had some benefits. \n\nGo. Travel expands the mind and nourishes the soul.  Food, smells, sounds, culture etc. etc. \n\nGO!", "NTA for taking the job, you are, however, TA for not preparing him for adulthood. Assuming he has no physical or mental limitations, you have failed your son.", "NTA\n\n22 is old enough. Forgot the the helicopter parents saying it isn't. \n\nAlso, looks like you moving overseas is the kick in the ass he needed to get his life in order.", "NTA This opportunity will be good for both of you. If you are keeping the lines of communication open, you will be confident in his decisions. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nThis all sounds so positive for you and him! \n\nIt had even motivated him to better himself!\n\nGo live your life!", "What kind of friends do you have?  Take the opportunity it\u2019s time he grows up", "NTA - About time to push the bird out of the nest because nothing was moving. And guess what ? Things are moving now, and for the best. He didin't just tried to keep on mooching of you but is actually making great real progress torward independance. That is wonderful !! I wish he knows basic cooking, cleaning and laundrying, but it's never too late to learn AND he can catch up with minimal help. If you stays you will keep on enabling him to do nothing with his life.\n\nCongratulation for the job abroad ! Enjoy !", "You know, this is so hard to judge from the outside. 22 is a grown up, so he should indeed make steps towards independence...but we don't know how much you have prepared him....", "No way, you're not selfish! He needs to find something to do with his life and you need to do what you think serves you best and makes you happy! He's old enough, co-dependend child-parent relationships can get quite weird with the age of the child rising....i know someone who has an over 30 years old Mama's a**hole sitting at home now.... dynamic is super toxic and she just can't stop doing everything for him ..... wouldn't recommend.....", "NTA! You paid your dues raising him. His lack of ambition is not your problem and you deserve to take this amazing opportunity!", "Your son has worn himself down into a nice big rut. He\u2019s worn it down so much that it\u2019s basically over his head, and he is content down there because there is no reason for him to leave.\n\nYou moving to another country is suddenly a reason. It\u2019s like it started raining and flooding the rut, and he now has to get out or drown. It spurned him to action he wouldn\u2019t otherwise take, because he now doesn\u2019t have a choice.\n\nGet out of the rut or drown.\n\nThis is the best thing for both of you. It forces him to do something about his life, and you get a nice job abroad with some extra pay on top of it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t take the job, he\u2019ll stay in that rut as long as he can. All motivation he has to get his GED or a job will go away the **instant** you turn down that job, because it will mean he can settle back in and not bother putting in the effort to get out of his rut.\n\nGo. As counterintuitive as it seems, you\u2019re helping him by going. He will not change without this.\n\nNTA", "Nta. He is 22. He needs to be doing work or school. Or both part time. Time for him to fly on his own.", "NTA. Sounds like you lit a fire and it's working. You may have just saved his life prospects by going away!", "NTA. Your kid is old enough. It's time for the bird to leave the nest. Perhaps, if it's a possibility, let him take the initiative on getting a visa to move with you and let him work through the process. Otherwise, moving out is the best thing for him. He likely can't live on his own so he's going to have to figure out how to live with strangers and split bills and other responsibilities.", "You're NTA for taking the job, but how the hell did you let your son hit 22 with no GED/high school diploma and no ability to support himself? What happened?", "NTA, at least he is 22, mine was 35 freakin years old!  Had to kick his ass out too.  He will be fine as is mine.", "NTA.  Oh please, at 22, he should have been out long ago.  I went in the military at 18 due to having no other options.  Now, there are way more job opportunities...  Congrats on the awesome opportunity. Enjoy it for as long as you can!", "NTA he needs to get out on his own!", "if u dont do it now it'll never happen. for his sake, do it", "NTA. You would be doing him a disservice if you allowed him to continue to live like a child for much longer. He needs to learn to live as an independent adult and learn what it takes to support himself. \n\nI'd almost wonder if his disinterest in obtaining an education or getting a job is because you've enabled him for too long.", "NTA. He's 22 and not in university or working. You taking this overseas job is giving him the wakeup call he needs to be more independent and has already been proven by his recent actions.", "\\>He can do laundry, can budget, also can cook. He is responsible enough to care for two dogs when I\u2019m away.\n\nThat's... like the bare minimum of survival. If he isn't already able to live on his own with his current skills, it's okay to say he doesn't have life skills. NTA for taking this opportunity, but have you considered your role in why you consider these to be \"life skills\" for a 22-year-old adult man?", "NTA you should have done this a long time ago. Some people need a kick in the ass to get their shit together. You made life to comfortable for him and shielded him from all the consequences of his choices", "Exactly! Also, \"you can't live with me anymore because I'm moving\" (*especially* if moving for reasons like a better job or health) and \"you can't live with me anymore but because you're 18+ even though nothing else about my life will change\" are two very different things. The first is you living your life and doing what's best for yourself. The second is being an asshole.", "NTA.  None of these friends criticizing you are offering to let him couch surf to their places.  How is it their business?", "NTA, do it! I went to international school growing up and the teachers there were awesome people with well rounded lives. Make money, travel. Your son can visit if he saves up. 22 is perfectly fine to ask someone to take more responsibility for themselves.", "How many adult children are living in the basements of these friends?", "Well, The Aunt having regular contact might help with questions about the art of living - why did my sweater shrink to one quarter of its size when I washed it? How do you make mashed potatoes? How long does a hard boiled egg take to cook? How often and where should I get my car serviced? Is changing the oil really that important? What is a budget and how do I make one?\n\nAdulting can be a bit hard to reconcile at first if you failed to pay attention....", "I agree!", "Obviously, he can do many other things , and obviously I\u2019m aware this is the bare minimum. Lots of posters before you have asked if he can cook etc- so I just edited my post.", "> I\u2019m going to help him pay for the move, pay the security deposit for his apartment, and give him enough extra for the first month until he gets paid before I leave. My sister lives nearby and can help him if he needs anything that can\u2019t be solved by calling me. She will also check on him periodically.\n\nDid you miss the entirety of this paragraph?", "I think it\u2019s the best thing that ever happened for her son.", "NTA and OP is still helping, constructively. Best on your new job!", "This was what I was going to say.  He seems to be doing what he needs to do.  This seems like a great opportunity all around.", "Honestly, if he calls her just to ask how long to boil an egg, i think she should tell him to look up a recipe instead of calling for every little thing. His whole problem is that he needs to learn independence. He should call to catch up, not to ask things he can figure out in 10 seconds himself.", "Google can also inform him of these situations.", "NTA. Have fun and good job with the push out of the nest.", "I called my father on how to cook an egg\u2026my father did not teach my brother or I to cook so while gender equal we both had to figure it out. We each cook differently as a result", "It was also odd how OP said the son can be left alone for long periods of time as evidenced by OP's vacations. Yes, you can generally leave adults alone. That would really not need to be said for an adult. I would expect that for a 15-year-old kid maybe. \n\nI'm wondering if there's a developmental delay or disability involved and, if so, why OP omitted the information.", "Good point and Ya know, i didnt even factor in the vacation thing.  \n\nI think I saw OP mention in a comment that they are living paycheque to paycheque. Not saying OP cant vacation, but its odd they've been on vacations that r so long that they consider their son as having some kind of experience living alone.\n\nAlso kind of throws off the 'spoiled entitled lazy kid' vibes if OP isn't taking the son on these long vacations.     \n\nI still want to hear why OPs friends think the son isnt ready tho. Maybe the guy is just lazy, maybe he had legit reasons for the delay. Not enough info for me tbh.", "I agree. There are missing reasons and they were very indirectly mentioned in the post. Maybe it wouldn't change the verdict, but I'm inclined to think it would if intentionally left out. \n\nAssuming none of factors we discussed, then I don't think she's done anything wrong by asking her adult son to become independent, but I'm dubious about the facts. From me it's a tentative NTA.", "Huh. Seems like your son went through a really tough time. Couldn\u2019t he go to culinary school after GED? I think your NTA for moving now (or then) but you need to work on practical solutions to help your son. Can you pay/ suppliment his rent while he does GED? Can you pay for culinary school? Your previous choices literally put him back two years in life. He needs help.\nEdit to add: i know he didn\u2019t want to do the GED before but maybe if he can see a path forward and that he is a little bit older he might be more receptive (especially if you help somewhat)"]}
