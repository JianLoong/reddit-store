I\u2019ve encouraged him to get a job and an education over the years, but he\u2019s shown no interest. Recently, I have been offered a job at an international school overseas. The salary and benefits are currently far better than my current position in the U.S.\n\nMy son wanted to go with me overseas, but is too old to get a dependent visa. I told him this was an amazing opportunity  for me and he needed to start acting like an adult and get a job. My friends say he isn\u2019t ready to live on his own, that I\u2019m being selfish, and now I\u2019m second guessing myself. \n\nHe\u2019s starting to take initiative since my announcement I was taking the new job. He\u2019s studying for the GED and almost ready to take it, has researched what type of work he wants to do,and the places he can work. He\u2019s even found apartments in the area that he can live in.\n\nI\u2019m going to help him pay for the move, pay the security deposit for his apartment, and give him enough extra for the first month until he gets paid before I leave. My sister lives nearby and can help him if he needs anything that can\u2019t be solved by calling me. She will also check on him periodically. Finally, he\u2019s been alone before when I\u2019ve been on vacation and has been fine. \n\nSo, am I selfish for taking this job? Im paycheck to paycheck now.

I am not one to believe in kicking at kid out when they hit legal adulthood, but he needs to start a life of independence. How long are you supposed to wait,according to these \u201cfriends\u201d who tell you to disregard a wonderful opportunity? Good luck", "NTA. You are not selfish for taking this job. You are giving your son a chance to grow up and be independent. You have supported him for 22 years and now it's time for him to take responsibility for his own life. You are also helping him with the move, the deposit, and the first month's rent, which is more than generous. Your sister is nearby to help him if he needs anything. He has shown initiative by studying for his GED, researching jobs and apartments, and preparing for his future. He should be proud of himself and so should you.\n\nYou deserve this opportunity to advance your career and improve your financial situation. You have worked hard as a teacher and a single parent. Don't let your friends guilt-trip you into staying or taking your son with you overseas. They don't know what's best for you or your son. You do.\n\nYou are not abandoning your son. You are giving him a gift of independence and self-reliance. He will learn valuable skills and lessons that will serve him well in life. He will also appreciate you more for trusting him and supporting him from afar.\n\nYou are doing the right thing for both of you. Go ahead and take this job with confidence and excitement. Congratulations on your new adventure!\ud83c\udf89", "NTA - 22 is more than enough time to have got your act together. This opportunity sounds great, don't let yourself miss out", "NTA. Have fun and good job with the push out of the nest. It sounds like it\u2019s working!", "NTA\nYou didn't mention any physical or mental issues that are keeping him from working, just that he's not interested.  Time for some tough love, you've allowed him to be this aimless mooch and it's got to stop. Your friends who say he's not ready are AH's for guilting you. \n\nTake the job, do what's best for you. He either steps up or he doesn't but he has got to take responsibility for his life.", "NTA. It\u2019s time for your son to take some responsibility for himself (and it sounds like this situation is finally motivating him to do so). It sounds like you and his aunt can still provide him some safety netting in case he stumbles along the way, which is all you owe him at this point. Otherwise, you\u2019re ending up with a 45 year old boy still living with you.", "NTA. He isn't a child any longer. You are several years late but taking this job and leaving is the best choice for you and for him. He will scramble for a few years but at least he will become an adult.", "NTA - Sounds like he's suddenly being proactive about his life and doing a fairly good job  keep encouraging him!", "NTA. You gave him plenty of notice, and you are helping him get on his feet, with rent etc. and its not like he'll be completely alone, since your sister is nearby. Don't second guess yourself, he will NEVER live on his own unless he tries, and this is the perfect opportunity for him to learn to", "NTA\n\nYour son is fully an adult and needs to start acting like one. This will help him become independent and will benefit him for the rest of his life.\n\nIf he doesn't become independent now - then when? Would it be better when he's 25, 30, 45? Now is better - for him and for you. Go live your life and let him learn to live his life.", "NTA\n\nHuge congratulations to an epic new opportunity! You\u2019ve done a great job supporting your kid, now give them that extra little kick out of the nest that they need to finally fly.\n\nAnd maybe spread your wings yourself, while you\u2019re at it!\n\nCome back and tell us how it goes ^.^", "NTA.  Your son appears to be thriving now that he feels he has no choice but to support himself.  I think you are doing the right thing for both of you.", "NTA - If anything, I think most people would say you're still coddling him. I don't mean to be harsh, its just that expecting to have to solve his problems over the phone, having your sister check up on him, etc, shouldn't be necessary. The way you wrote about all this made me think he was developmenally disabled, or a young teenager. But apparently hes a normal 22 year old. \n\nYou can be there for him emotionally, but maybe encourage him to figure things out on his own. I know i did plenty of googling when I moved out. Not that I didn't ask my parents for advice, but I'm almost 30 and still searching shit like, \"do I need to use fabric softener\" most days. \n\nAlso, paying part of his rent is generous and not necessarily bad, but be careful not to subsidize him living above his means, you know? If he's not financially literate he might choose a place that you'll have to help pay for indefinitely. Make sure it's somewhere that a realistic job could pay for.", "He's 22 and needs to grow TF up.

It\u2019s not like you are throwing him out without help!", "NTA.  Barring any emotional or cognitive disorders, it is past time for this little bird to leave the nest and learn to fly.  Life experiences are not and should not be a race to the bottom, but he's been coddled far too long unless there is a medical need not specified in the post.", "NTA. You're not required to continue supporting your son's failure to launch. It looks like you've allowed a transition period to give him some time to adjust (which is quite generous). Maybe he'll take off now that he has to figure things out.", "NTA \n\nIt also seems like this is exactly the kind of motivational \u201cpush\u201d he might have needed!

Not to say you shouldn\u2019t take the new job or move, but you asked if you were TA for making your son support himself - and considering you didn\u2019t do anything to arm him with the tools to do so, yes.", "NTA. Your child is no longer a child; he's an able-bodied 22 year old. At this stage, parenthood shouldn't be an obstacle to accepting an overseas job opportunity.", "NTA.  You have to consider your future too.", "NTA, NTA, NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your son isn\u2019t complaining about the situation and is actually taking pride in himself for the first time in his life.

And why do ur friends think he isnt ready?", "INFO: You're a teacher but you couldn't manage to keep your own child motivated in school long enough to get a diploma?\n\nYou're NTA for your specific question, but you have really done your son a disservice thus far by coddling him this long.", "INFO: how the hell did he get to 22 without a GED or ever a job?\n\nWhere were you his entire life?\n\nSomething should have changed *years or decades* ago...", "Time to fly queen\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Take this opportunity and soar with it to fullfilness", "NTA. It\u2019s clear your son needed a push to better himself. It\u2019s okay to give him that push.

You are not selfish, you put in the effort, did the work, everything else is in your son. On top of that you're willing to financially help your son with moving.

Your kid is an adult, go live your life.", "NTA. He needs to leave the nest. You were doing him a disservice by supporting him so long.", "jumping on to add that this seems to be the kick in the ass he needed. look how much he has done to prepare in such a short time. Best wishes to you both!", "Totally see your point, but that condition needs to be backed with a willingness to throw him out if he doesn't meet the requirements. If someone knows there's no actual possibility of being kicked out, they're less likely to get off their ass. A lot of people are unwilling to throw their 18-22 year old onto the street, so no pressure there.
