You are giving your son a chance to grow up and be independent. You have supported him for 22 years and now it's time for him to take responsibility for his own life. You are also helping him with the move, the deposit, and the first month's rent, which is more than generous. Your sister is nearby to help him if he needs anything. He has shown initiative by studying for his GED, researching jobs and apartments, and preparing for his future. He should be proud of himself and so should you.\n\nYou deserve this opportunity to advance your career and improve your financial situation. You have worked hard as a teacher and a single parent. Don't let your friends guilt-trip you into staying or taking your son with you overseas. They don't know what's best for you or your son. You do.\n\nYou are not abandoning your son. You are giving him a gift of independence and self-reliance. He will learn valuable skills and lessons that will serve him well in life.

He either steps up or he doesn't but he has got to take responsibility for his life.", "NTA. It\u2019s time for your son to take some responsibility for himself (and it sounds like this situation is finally motivating him to do so).

Otherwise, you\u2019re ending up with a 45 year old boy still living with you.", "NTA. He isn't a child any longer. You are several years late but taking this job and leaving is the best choice for you and for him.

You gave him plenty of notice, and you are helping him get on his feet, with rent etc. and its not like he'll be completely alone, since your sister is nearby.

Your son appears to be thriving now that he feels he has no choice but to support himself.  I think you are doing the right thing for both of you.", "NTA - If anything, I think most people would say you're still coddling him. I don't mean to be harsh, its just that expecting to have to solve his problems over the phone, having your sister check up on him, etc, shouldn't be necessary. The way you wrote about all this made me think he was developmenally disabled, or a young teenager. But apparently hes a normal 22 year old. \n\nYou can be there for him emotionally, but maybe encourage him to figure things out on his own. I know i did plenty of googling when I moved out. Not that I didn't ask my parents for advice, but I'm almost 30 and still searching shit like, \"do I need to use fabric softener\" most days. \n\nAlso, paying part of his rent is generous and not necessarily bad, but be careful not to subsidize him living above his means, you know? If he's not financially literate he might choose a place that you'll have to help pay for indefinitely. Make sure it's somewhere that a realistic job could pay for.", "He's 22 and needs to grow TF up.

This was the motivation he needed and OP isn't \"abandoning\" him, they are setting him up with a support system and on the right foot.", "Few things inspire like a true deadline.", "Yah the way its worded seems off to me too. Especially if the adult friends are on the sons side.    \nDont know many people who would be protective of someone else's 22 year old drop out son living at home unless something else is up.", "You\u2019re a teacher and you moved states and transferred your son to a school where his credits wouldn\u2019t transfer? NTA for having him go out on his own at this point but poor planning on his credits not transfer over. Of course he lost motivation.", ">joint work/ school program\n\nThis requires elaboration.  I'm all for kicking a failure to launch out of the nest but there's more to this.", "Why didnt he get his GED? And why do ur friends think he isnt ready?", "No mystery, lol. BOCES has a program where you can learn a skill while you earn credits to graduate. One program they offer is Culinary. He wanted to be a chef, so he enrolled in that program", "I did something similar in high school however I also still had other classes beyond it.  How is it that they wanted him back two full grades?", "Different state. Credits didn\u2019t transfer. Part of culinary was 1 math credit, 1 reading", "Why did your family move? Seems like that really messed him up. Not to be rude, but if I were literally a senior in high school and someone told me I'd have to do two more years, I'd go insane.", "I moved because I was taking care of my grandmother who had dementia. She passed. I was in a little town where I was substitute teaching making 90 dollars a day, gross. I moved to get a real tenure track teaching position."]}
