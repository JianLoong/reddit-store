While that is EXTREMELY fucked- he did it for good reason.\n\nShe was not only on multiple (I\u2019m talking at least 7/8) drugs daily, drinking with them, functioning that way around her kids, driving around in a vehicle that isn\u2019t safe while under the influence with her kids, taking them to terrible places\u2026but her kids were also missing school, moving & transferring to 3/4/5 different schools in one year to avoid cps (every year), and getting abused. These two kids are 12 & 13 now and have been dealing with this pretty much since they were at school age (5/6). \n\n\nWe\u2019ve been trying to get my sister off our grandmother\u2019s couch because she literally sends her into episodes. **grandma has dementia & deals with high blood pressure.** My sister won\u2019t budge even though she has her own house down the driveway. (Which makes zero sense as to why she\u2019d move around place to place) Grandma & sister got into a heated argument yesterday and I was pulled in. Again. This time it was because of struggles. My sister got up to use the bathroom and my grandmother starts whispering to me, \u201cI feel so badly for her, she has such bad luck. I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not a single parent I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Completely forgetting that my sister had just destroyed her own windshield, ditched her own car, then forgot where she left it, smashed her own phone for the 3637282744749 time and had to replace it.

So my sister basically gets to have the same argument, and get away with the same shit that impacts our grandmother\u2019s health *daily*. And she knows it. She\u2019s pointed it out.\n\nSo here\u2019s where I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m an asshole because a looooot of personal feelings are involved here. (I am a disabled single mother, dealing with cancer, homeschooling my disabled son- who is about to get *another* heart procedure, and I still work. I never get credit for anything in this family.) But I spoke up to our grandmother and I said, \u201cShe\u2019s a mom, but she\u2019s not a single mom in my eyes. Not right now. She doesn\u2019t even have her kids, or see them, or talk to them, or take care of them. **I** am a single mom.\u201d \n\nThe conversation ended right then. It\u2019s really sad to watch honestly.

It's clear that you've been through a lot, dealing with your own challenges and taking care of your son while not receiving the recognition you deserve within your family.  \nWhile your sister may be dealing with her own issues, including substance abuse, it's understandable that you would see her as not actively parenting her children. Expressing your perspective to your grandmother is a way to highlight the differences in your situations, and it's not unreasonable to want your efforts as a single parent to be acknowledged and respected.  \nYour family's dynamics are complex, and it can be challenging to navigate these situations. It's important to continue advocating for your own needs and boundaries while expressing your concerns when necessary. You're not wrong for speaking your truth in this case.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to worry for your grandmother's well being.  Like others commented, keep records of mental and physical damages that your sister had/have done, including photos and recordings.\nI'm not sure what exactly the VA can do, but if I'm to guess, you're in the US, then I would contact your state's Department of Aging and make a report/statement of elderly abuse as well to ask for advice on making a police report on behalf of your grandmother that she and you father did not want to make because of whatever reasons they state a well as any other questions you may have. \nLet then know that she has dementia and ask the VA on updates on her mentality as well as her physical shape, there's a possibility that you can become a medical Power of Attorney to protect her, so ask her doctors if they can provide a report that states that she doesn't have the physical and mental capabilities to able to function properly for her well being. \n\nAs for your sister, this is hard but I agree with putting her into a facility that would provide the help she really need. Hopefully there's one nearby that have therapies as well.  (I'm not familiar with how it works, so I'm sorry if I'm wrong)\n\nI hope this info can provide help that you need. Best wishes to you and your loved ones.", "I\u2019d be calling adult protective services for grandma if she has memory issues and the druggie sister is taking advantage of her and causing her health issues.  Grandma needs protection.", "Our father happens to be the caretaker for our grandmother. He won\u2019t call the cops. He won\u2019t report anything. Grandma says not to call cops either but I genuinely don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. She doesn\u2019t know wth is actually happening. I\u2019ve looked into involuntary rehab/mental health treatment for sister but I\u2019m not having any luck with that. I\u2019m not sure what to do but I do know that she needs to get help before she accidentally kills herself. From what I\u2019ve read, you have to get a conservatorship- and again, our father won\u2019t do that. Her kids don\u2019t deserve to lose her. This is such a shitty situation.", "Agreed! We were actually addicts together as young teens. My first addiction I had (was to ice) started at the age of 12. She was 15. I got stuck on it for 4.5yrs but I did end up escaping. And for a really long time I thought she had, too. But she was just hiding it really well. The person she is has to be in there somewhere, but idk how tf to help her. I want to though.", "I\u2019m not sure but I\u2019m definitely looking into it. She\u2019s getting caretaker service through the VA- which pays my father. Grandma wanted to help him & chose him as her caretaker because he has his own struggles to deal with (stomach issues). I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s already getting investigated/audited with that itself.", "I hope OP sees this - this is the most important thing about this whole post.", "nta at all. write this shit down. time, date, what was said, etc. so you at least have documentation.\n\neta: im so sorry youre going through all this shit and meanwhile your familys busy enabling your addict sister. jfc. youre a really strong person for just getting through every day w all of that shit, imo. \n\nalso added judgement", "I don't think you can. Addiction is a very personal struggle/path. One I deal with myself. And you know already from personal experience that meth is one of the hardest to overcome. The only person that's going to get her out is herself. And as difficult as it is to watch her go through this, you have to let her find her own way through it or it won't stick. All you can do is keep reminding her you'll be there when she gets it together, and let the rest go. Don't enable, set clear boundaries, stick by them.", "Exactly. That was beautifully written.
