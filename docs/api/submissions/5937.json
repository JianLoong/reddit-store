If the meeting doesn't include an inspection of the property you are residing in (and it is worth considering that even if he doesn't want to see it you might have some issues you want to show him in person) then perhaps you would meet in a cafe or something near your workplace when you are on a break to enable you to compromise on the date/time.", "YTA.

Maybe OP should get some legal advice or bring someone to the meeting with them, but avoiding the meeting and avoiding addressing the problem are non starters.
