The kids are in all in school and I took over as the main caregiver when she was gone. It went well and when she came back she asked if I had trouble. I told her no and everything went smoothly. This started an argument about how I thought it was so easy that she was a SAHM. It wasn\u2019t a good time and I already was pushing her to go back to work partime since the kids were in school.\n\nWe have talked about her to start looking around summer. The issue now is I work from home twice a week and every-time she sees my screen or I complain about work she tells me she can do it. I have talked to her about it and nothing changes. That if she did it would go smoothly. I thought back on our argument and have asked her about it, she denies it has anything to do with it.\n\nSo she won\u2019t stop and I had enough of it today. I was trying to figure out why there was an error in my code. She saw what I was doing and told me she could do that. I told her to go ahead made a copy that she could work on. Well she tried for about five minutes until she gave up, I reiterated that if she can do my job find the error. \n\nThis started a huge argument about making her look like an idiot and now she isn\u2019t talking to me.", "created_utc": 1701717495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ars82/aita_for_proving_that_my_wife_cant_do_my_job/", "score": 1631, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've never disparaged her role as SAHM, even after she got back from her girls trip.\n2. She got mad because taking care of the kids for a week while she was gone went smoothly (or at least wasn't the reckoning she thought it would be for you)\n3. She starts disparaging your job, because apparently you can also do hers.\n4. She harps on it for a while till OP snaps and lets her have a go at software dev.\n5. She thinks OP is an asshole for proving she can't do his job.\n\nBout sum it up?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf so, NTA. \n\nShe was being overly petty, and decided to drag you down to her level.  You shouldn't have done it, but I'd chalk it up to FA-FO.", ">I was trying to figure out why there was an error in my code.\n\nSo knowing absolutely nothing about your code, she just assumed she could debug it? Does she also assume she can teach Russian even though she (presumably) doesn't speak Russian?\n\nNTA, she has no one but herself to blame for looking like an idiot.", "NTA \n\n>when she came back she asked if I had trouble.\n\nSounds like she expected the house to be falling apart without her presence because her role as housewife is so difficult a man couldn't possibly do it himself. The fact it went so smoothly for you has probably pissed her off because it's proven that the workload at home actually isn't so huge that it prevents her going back to work, and now you both know that.", "NTA - I think she probably expected (maybe even wanted, a little) for you to fail, and when you didn\u2019t, she put her back up", "NTA. She embarrassed herself by making a boast and being unable to deliver when called on it. Having her constantly telling you she can do your job must grate. Maybe this will slow her down.\n\nYou didn't make her look like an idiot. She did that all by herself.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand why so many people make everything in a relationship a competition. \n\nMy late partner and I had vastly different jobs and I was the primary care taker for our son and I was always made to be felt I like I didn't have a hard job....which was annoying because I work in tech and he had more of physical labor job (working on cars)...both are hard...just in different ways. My brain is fried at the end of the day, his body was fried. \n\nSeems to me like she is insecure about what she is contributing to the household and wants to prove her worth. \n\nSo to me you have two options...either talk to her and see if maybe it's an insecurity and see if she will open up and you can comfort her and make her feel valuable. Or she can get a job outside of the home to make herself feel valuable.", "Info: in your initial argument did you tell her that being the caregiver was easy? Or did she just infer that when you told her things went smoothly?", "NTA, but your wife has more issues than the fact that she cannot do your job.", "NTA and it sounds like she's mad because she was hoping you'd fail watching the kids thus hoping you would stop pestering her about getting a job.", "Info: she\u2019s a stay at home mom who\u2019s staying home without children there?  How old are the kids?", "NTA", "Nta, you already communicate with her about this. What did she expect to happen", "Your wife is insecure and needs a job. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nThe folks saying E S H are right that you're being kind of petty.  I get that.  \n\nBut sometimes petty is required to get the point across.\n\nIt's one thing to acknowledge that being a SAHP is not a free ride, that there is actual work involved.  It's another to say that it qualifies you to do anything else.  Especially because, functionally, there's no interview, no certification process to become a SAHP.  You just do it.", "Wifey sucks for leaving you as the only bread-winner when there\u2019s really no need for that anymore. Drop the back and forth of \u201cmy job is harder than yours\u201d and ask her flat out why she\u2019s refusing to go back to work. \nThat\u2019s why she\u2019s pissed off at you being able to handle the kids, because she\u2019s trying to maintain the idea that looking after her school aged children is a full time job, which it\u2019s not, and she\u2019s doing that so she doesn\u2019t need to get an actual job. \nYou\u2019re both there to look after the kids, you\u2019re both capable of looking after the kids, she doesn\u2019t need to devote all her time and energy towards that like she would when they were babies, time for her to move on to something else.", "I'm going with NTA on this one. You asked her (more than once) to stop making those comments, but she continued. Maybe it's time for a discussion about WHY you asked her to find the error in the code. Maybe she's not putting it together and thinks you did that just to embarrass her.", "NTA.", "Sounds like she came home looking for an argument\u2026 you didn\u2019t drop your blunt while she was gone did you?? \ud83d\ude02 Jk man\nNTA, you didn\u2019t deserve all that.", "I'm confused - Is she a software developer who took time off to raise kids? Or does she not know how to code at all? If she is not/never was a developer, why the hell would she keep telling you she could do your job? My eyes glaze over whenever I happen to glance in the direction of my husband's code. \n\nAnyway. NTA, regardless of your answers to my above questions.", "NTA,\n\nBut I think she's looking for validation that she's an equally contributing member of the family. This totally seems like something my GF would say, she's fishing for compliments/validation.", "NTA. However, if I may give some advice as someone who\u2019s been married 30-plus years: \n\nClearly she expected you to fail while she was gone, and that wasn\u2019t very nice. But if being a SAHM is her whole identity, it may have been a bit of an ego blow to find out you handled it while also working full time. You say you want her to get a part-time job; maybe she\u2019s afraid there isn\u2019t anything she would be good at? \n\nMy advice is this: build her up. Tell her that while you were able to handle the kids while she was gone, you don\u2019t think the job of SAHM is an easy one. Give her concrete examples of things she is good at doing or skills she has that could transfer into paid work. Maybe suggest she take some classes or do a certification program, to increase her job skills/better her career path.\n\nI was out of the workforce as a SAHM for several years and it was scary to jump back in. Be her cheerleader and encourager. You catch more flies with honey, etc.", "I went back to work full time when the youngest of my three started kindergarten. It was scary for me. That was twenty years ago. I was 35.  She knows it isn't necessary or needed for her to be home full time. She is feeling a bit weird about it all and probably scared to jump back in the workforce.  This is probably where all this is coming from: NTA", "I think she was the asshole for how she reacted to her ego being hurt by you not having a hard time at home with the kids. She does sound like she has become nothing but a mother in the time she has been a SAHM. She will need sympathy and help with getting herself back into the workforce. It coupd honestly help her mental state as picking fights with your husband over this is not healthy nor is demeaning his job which provides for your household. I think you would do well to understand you only did her work for a week. She does it everyday with no end in sight and gave up years of her life to devote to the family what otherwise would have gone to studying or starting a career. You can't just wae up after raising kids and not working and suddenly know what direction your life should take with something like that. She sounds jealous you got to have a career but she feels she lost that opportunity.", "NTA However kids can be absolutely ruthless to their mothers for some odd reason. But I would suggest talking with her and inform her that the week went easy for you but it's not a daily thing that you do like her. I would apologize to her that you feel bad that she took it the wrong way and word it differently? \n\nBut also i don't get why people are saying you're being petty. She's the one that said she could fix the code. So that's pretty dumb on her part if she has no clue what she's doing.", "NTA.\n\nBut if I am using my crystal ball to determine why she is like this towards you I would guess:\n\n1. She feels like her job as SAHM is unfulfilling.\n2. She feels that you are incapable of understanding how hard being a SAHM is.\n3. She feels underappreciated.\n\nAll guesses, because I don't have a crystal ball, but she obviously is in her thoughts.\n\nI would try to reinforce how important she is to you and your family.. maybe that will stop some of this at-home chaos being created?", "The girls were feeding each other BS on the trip... probably told the wife that OP was lazy and useless. OP proved her wrong.\n\nOP, are any of those \"girls\" single? Don't let your wife hang around them, nothing but jealousy, and will undermine your marriage. Wife probably heard all the stories of partying, etc. and wife feels like she's missing out", "NTA. She\u2019s insecure about her SAHM status now that the kids are at school and you\u2019ve asked her to get a job but she doesn\u2019t want to. Seeing that everything went fine without her reinforced that she should probably think about getting atleast a part-time job and she doesn\u2019t like that so she unfairly lashed out at you. \n\nShe was hoping that you\u2019d struggle so that she could stay at home and have reason to stay you \u201cneed\u201d her but that didn\u2019t happen and people generally react badly when real life doesn\u2019t follow the script they\u2019d planned out in their head. \n\nIf your family needs more money and your kids are at school, she should get atleast a part-time job.", "One of the glorious things that every husband and wife needs to remember is that not every argument is about the topic at hand. I feel like your wife is feeling dual pressures. 1) She is being told by you to go back to work because of financial reasons. 2) Society tells moms to raise the kids. John Gray wrote this book about throwing rocks at each other in a relationship. What you said to her seemed like a tiny rock to you. But as a person under pressure it seemed like a boulder to her. Her saying she could do your job seemed like a small thing to her but it was a boulder to you. With that being said, you are nta but even if you were swinging sticks in a circle and accidently hit someone you would apologize. So my suggestion is open the gates of communication with an apology. If that conversation starts another argument, you guys need to go to therapy and learn to talk to each other without throwing pebbles or boulders.", "NTA - But as a SAHM it\u2019s hard to get a decent job that will work with the kids school hours. Most retail and fast food jobs want you to work weekends. The only job is with the school district and it\u2019s hard to get your foot in the door. \n\nTalk to your wife. If you need financial support then your wife has to get a job (even if it\u2019s selling stuff on Etsy or whatever). Just remember that daycare is expensive and most of your wife\u2019s paycheck will probably pay for it. Just try and run the numbers, it might not be worth this argument.", "Regardless of her training as a software engineer. I can not imagine going up to a random code base, or project that I have never seen and been like you know what I can fix that easily. Especially if the person who has been working on it for a while is stuck. Like god damn that is arrogance.", "As a software engineer I feel particularly qualified to issue a NTA to you and a BWAHAHAA!!! to your wife for thinking she could just sit down and be a programmer with zero effort.", "Reddit is in shambles because a man perfectly did what a SAHM thought he would fail to do. You insulted a woman so of course YTA. Lol. /S", "I think this is her frustration speaking. Stay at home moms have difficulties in finding a sense of value and meaning in their lives from what I see in myself and my friends. Her only \"pride\" is most likely that she takes good care of the kids and the house and that other people would not be able to fill her role. More probably she was hoping a \"we missed you so much, thank God you are back\" to give her a sense of validation.\nAs a mom myself, although a high achiever at work before children, I find it now hard to reintegrate, my mind is not where it supposed to be, my availability is not the same as I am always revolving around the kid's schedule.\nDuring my maternity leave I had a sense of void seeing my husband being able to continue his work life, talk to adults for 8 hours straight, drink a coffee and have a conversation with a coworker and work on a project. So in those moments my only fulfillment was that I was taking good care of our household having a bit of pride that I cannot be \"replaced\" there. \nYou are right, a part time job would change her state of mind a lot. It is very important to have her own thing going on. But also try and support her as she may be having a hard time. Just my opinion", "SAHM love to think they have the hardest most technically difficult job in the world. It\u2019s honestly cringe. There never grateful and always just want more", "NTA, some things appear easy but challenging to do. I think your job is included in that category.\n\n It is not for me to say, but you could teach your wife some of your job instead of challenging her. It helps; when I am stuck, I talk out loud because I sometimes make silly mistakes.", "NTA. She FAFO.", "100% Dunning-Kruger effect. \n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m commenting as a SAHM:\nYou both have some built up resentment/ contentment- you need to work on this in marriage counseling. I know that seems like a jump, but it really can build into a lot more. Being a SAHM is \u201ceasy\u201d in a sense that yeah we do \u201cbasic\u201d chores and keep the house and kids in line- at the cost of a career- which has weighed heavy on me. I yearn for more tasks that I dan use my brain! I actually went back to work for a few years full time, and am now back to a SAHM again because it just works better for our family ecosystem and we can swing it.\n\nTry to let go, apologize, and respect each other for the contributions you both bring to your family. Yes a weekend or a few days seem easy- but can you imagine doing that forever? Do you want to? If you do, and she\u2019s ready to get some mental stimulation- maybe you guys can switch roles. Being a SAHM can wear on your soul in this career driven society- for real! I am sure she is grateful for her weekend away- and maybe you are refreshed being the sole provider for a few days! It\u2019s not \u201ceasy\u201d", "Being a SAHM is not easy. You did it for a week. Some weeks are peaceful, many are busy. It's a lot to ask of someone to continue doing everything a SAHM does and hold a job. Particularly since you've already admitted that you are only a secondary caregiver. It's a common phenomenon that children will be more easy-going with the \"fun\" parent that doesn't have to do all of the difficult tasks that keep a family together. You undervalue her.

Perfect example of fucked around and found out or played stupid games and won stupid prizes.   She was expecting you to have a hard time with childcare bc she doesn't want to go back to work  , and she was resentful and jealous  that you didn't have a hard time like she does. She was hoping you'd see how \" hard \"being a stay at home wife is and would let her stay home without a job.

She's acting like a toddler and needs to get a job.", "Anyone else been reading too much reddit, and fear the next post is going to be about the girls trip?", "NTA but it sounds like your wife is having some resentment. Maybe she's struggling with the children due to behavior. Ask her if she needs breaks and let her know you aren't judging her. Kids sometimes behave better for 1 parent and act a fool for the other. My 1 year old only behaves for her dad.", "NTA - SAHM is not a professional job. You don\u2019t need an education for it. Of course everyone can do it if they want or have to. I mean, basically everyone IS doing it to a degree. (100 years ago, literally every woman had to do it!)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean that her work is easy or useless. It\u2019s just not work that needs special education (I\u2019ll just assume, she didn\u2019t do \u201ebride school\u201c or home economics ?) but has more of a \u201efigure it out\u201c approach nowadays.", "Nah, she said she could do it.\n\nYou gave her the chance to prove it.\n\nShe failed.\n\nNo, your wife is the asshole for under-valuing the work that you do.

It sounds like you're both mad at eachother over how responsibility is split up in the house but taking the wrong approach. I can't begin to tell where the fault lies because it sounds like both of you are reacting to different situations that got on your nerves which creates new situations.\n\nI know it's almost cliche to recommend marriage counseling but a good counselor can help stop the cycle of both of you trying to 'win' and actually find a way to resolve the issues causing this.", "NTA.

Which, as I said, consisted mostly of the daytime talk shows, the internet was not yet born, or at least was not widely available to the general public.  \n\nThis same sort of rhetoric was tossed about then too.  Militant (not all of course) SAHMs: \"No one could do our job, we have the toughest job in the world, blah blah blah.\"  \n\n\nWhich is somewhat fair.  If you have a bunch of pre-school aged little kids, half of whom are in diapers, sure...that's a hard row to hoe.

Sweeping generalizations help no one.", "Just because what you do is harder doesn't mean being a SAHP isn't (or can't be) hard. Young kids particularly need all kinds of stimulation, socialisation, activities to help their education and development. The more engaged they are, the less downtime you have, and they can't always independent play safely if at all, which only gives you time when they're sleeping (or someone else is there to look after them) to do everything else around the house. When you need them to eat healthily, for example, you can't have a night off preparing actual decent food - which I know I don't have the energy for as someone who isn't feeding a child.\n\nIt's important to remember that the work week was based on a two parent household where one is the breadwinner and the other runs the home and family. The work week isn't designed for you to be able to do your full time job and look after your home. It's a sad reality the vast majority of us are living in, but it's effectively doing a job and a half (assuming you have a partner, both work, and both contribute equally at home). SAHPs, in addition to engaging their kids pretty much constantly when they're at home, and probably taking them to a whole bunch of activities or playdates, etc., are cooking, cleaning, tidying after the kids, doing laundry, looking after pets, budgeting, shopping, arranging insurance, laying bills, arranging health appointments, making social and extracurricular arrangements, and so on. It is a full job. Some people are more suited to it than others. Different people have different factors that make it harder or easier.

It's all the background work that really takes the effort, which is sometimes not seen in the day to day of checking tasks off the list.\n\nAll that said, I still think there's something weird here with OP's wife lashing out and feeling undervalued somehow. I wonder if there's something else here that she's not able to articulate about how difficult some aspects of her stay at home day are difficult? \n\nI don't want to read in anything that's not here, but it feels like something is missing.

His father loved to get him into sports, but rarely showed up to games or practices, wasn't great at keeping a job (I was always the steady income) and felt that anything on the outside of the house was man's work i.e mowing the lawn and everything inside the house was women's work, even if I was working overtime and living on 3 hours of sleep every night.

In the instance in the post N T A, but your comments give the feel that you want her to go back to work while being unwilling to listen to her objections. You guys need to have a conversation, and while she needs to listen, you definitely also need to listen, and it doesn't sound from your comments that you're good at listening either. I go ESH here.\n\nAlso, note that there are a lot of invisible aspects to running a household: calling doctors, scheduling things, calling school, running forgotten library books to school, going shopping, meal planning, ect. Look into mental load. It's possible that while you don't see much actual work, your wife is overwhelmed by her mental load, and can't add more at this stage in life. I have a kindergartener, second grader, and third grader, and they take a lot of time to manage even when they're at school. Also, my TV is often on while I work on other things, so hearing the TV doesn't necessarily mean that she's slacking off.\n\nOverall, keeping score of who does more will not ever bring you a happy marriage. Try to see her side. Actually listen to her and give her time to talk. If she gets flustered and can't defend her view, that may be a red flag that you've failed to be a safe space for your wife to express herself. That's common when someone tends to keep bringing up a disagreement, like her returning to work. Express to her that you need more down time if you do, and so you need her to pick up more slack during the day. Express to her that the budget isn't working and you either need her to work or you both need to find ways to spend less. But overall, this needs to be a conversation with listening on both sides and compromises, and it sounds like an ESH situation where you both have very different views on a matter, and neither side is listening to the other.", "TBH Im not entirely sure the price does either. It's just the arrogance that a career is more than a SAHP.. when in reality both are equally necessary for a functioning society.
