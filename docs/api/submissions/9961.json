In her own words, she takes no joy in anything, has no interest in anything, and in general can't do much more than exist. Our sex life is nonexistent.\u00a0\n\nI try my absolute best to be supportive. I will drop what I'm doing whenever she has the opportunity to engage in hobbies so I can watch after our child while she goes out. I do this every single time for her. I supported her seeking therapy, I try to provide good advice to her when she tries new medications and struggles to see results.\u00a0I put up with all of her criticisms and lashing-out with patience and nonjudgement.\n\nA week or so ago. I broke down because she could clearly tell I was in a bad mood and told her everything. How I didn't feel like a partner any more, just like a caregiver. How we never do anything together because she puts zero attempt into sharing interests. How frustrated I get going out every day and seeing happy couples doing happy things and engaging with each other, how other couples have healthy sex lives. I can't stop wondering - is this just going to be the rest of my life? \n\nOur discussion was almost entirely focused on how placing all the focus on her the last few years has left no room for me. Then - and this is the asshole part - the weight issue came up - I said again that I think it is a huge contributing factor for her depression. It's been uncontrolled weight gain the past few years, except when she was pregnant ironically enough. I'm not a hypocrite in this regard, I work very hard to stay in great shape and exercise is a big part of my life. But I'm concerned about her. After a certain point it gets offputting.\u00a0\n\nI will add that I've been depressed. Bad enough to go to the hospital. I've lost the weight. I've been through the struggles she's going through. \n\nShe's mentioned not being happy with her body many, many times, and alternates between wanting to lose weight and wanting to accept herself as she is. She obviously fixated on this comment and it really upset her.\n\nI want to support her, I really do. If being at her current weight means she can come out of her depression, obviously I would support that over her losing weight and staying depressed. And I don't want to paint too bleak a picture of her - she's a wonderful mother to our child and works very hard. We've gone to marriage counseling and she's made some good progress on being critical and judgmental of me, but after three years of that it's still hard to get past being treated that way.\u00a0\n\nI just don't know what to do or who to turn to. I don't know how to approach the issues with her, or even if I should.

It's great that you got on top of all this, but it doesn't mean that she can or will.\n* She might get better, but she might not. If your happiness is contingent on her being better, you will be miserable\n\nIt doesn't sound like you get what you need from this relationship and while you care for her, no one benefits from your own mental health spiralling down together with hers. I think you know what you need to do, you're just feeling so much guilt because leaving someone who is in such a bad place feels cruel. But you matter too. Your happiness and health matter.", "I\u2019m going to withhold judgement for the moment and just recommend both that you and your wife see individual therapists (her for her depression and you so that you have a place where you\u2019re allowed to vent and have things be about you), and that you start couples counseling. There are professionals who can help with this.", "This is way above reddit's paygrade. None of your are asshole. You are just both in a very, very difficult situation.\n\nWhat I see here is a loving partner that put their own life on hold to help their spouse. This is very nice of you. But at some point... you need to be able to live your life, too, and find ways to be happy. Seems like you already did everything you needed to do. Was it enough ? You can't keep on putting yourself second all your life. \n\nBest of luck to you !", "NAH - you can\u2019t do this on your own. You need an outlet. You need to get a therapist to talk to because it\u2019s a lot to handle. Her weight gain isn\u2019t the cause of the depression but the weight gain is a symptom of the depression. So unless she gets the proper medical help for the depression then she\u2019s not going to want to exercise or eat healthy because even just getting out of bed is a chore for her. Get yourself some help and someone to talk to and try and get her to agree to some professional help and just take baby steps through it all.", "I wouldnt want to stay in such a marriage.

As someone who was diagnosed with depression if my family felt this way I would need to know. I\u2019m sure there will be multiple opinions but I learned my triggers that cause me to spiral and I went to therapy and worked really hard to get to the bottom of why I felt the way I did. Depression is a medical illness but it doesn\u2019t just go away by not changing things in your life. I had a job that held me accountable and that was what pushed me to seek help.", "OP, a marriage goes both ways.

Sometimes people need to be held accountable for their actions before they change, and that sucks.", "I\u2019m likely going to get downvoted for this, but as someone who struggles managing mental health, there is no amount of yourself you can give to make someone else seek treatment. It\u2019s kind of selfish to not seek help when you\u2019re in a committed partnership like marriage and you have a debilitating condition like severe depression, yet use it as a crutch for continuing to indulge in this psychological disorder.\n\nNTA for what at least sounds like gently encouraging your wife to seek help and communicating your struggles and personal limits of support. \n\nYou are not a professional equipped to help define and give the assistance needed to help confront depression, and it is a heavy heavy burden to place that responsibility on a loved one.", "NAH.. i dont think it was a good time to bring that up though. but like other commenters have said, this is way above reddits paygrade lmao. you guys both need therapy", "\"therapy, or divorce.  It's time. \"         So many times I wish I had been more assertive.\n\nNTA.

Also, despite what some people here have said, if someone has told you that they're unhappy with their weight, there's nothing wrong with then suggesting losing that weight. \n\nWhat strikes me here is that this isn't some new thing that just cropped up. It's been years of your wife putting no effort into your relationship. You're not making any memories, you're not doing anything together, you're not sharing any interests, and you don't have a sex life. That's absolutely not a tenable marriage. \n\nYou have to really step back and decide what to do here. Being depressed definitely DOES NOT make someone an asshole. Not at all. However, it's been years of no improvement that's clearly building resentment in you (hence the post) and it's not fair to you for you to just have to deal with this situation for the rest of your life. If your wife doesn't want to work towards improving things then that's her prerogative, but you're entitled to your feelings and they're just as valid as hers.", "NTA OP and my heart goes out to you, you have some tough decisions ahead. You don\u2019t say how old you are but I assume on the younger side given that you had a child together recently. You are too young to have to be a caregiver instead of having a partner. You\u2019re going to have to assess if she\u2019s making progress toward getting better. If she is, I\u2019d say hang in a bit longer. If she\u2019s not, you\u2019re going to have to decide if you\u2019re going to sacrifice your dreams for your marriage, partner, and family along with your own happiness and mental health to be with her. Please update us at some point and let us know how it\u2019s going.  Good luck.", "NTA. It cannot be just about her wants/needs/wishes for years on end. Relationships require both partners do some give and take. There are times when one partner has to step up for a longer time, but it cannot go on for years.", "NTA at all. I'm so sorry you are going through this.", "NTA - Everyone here is hurting.  You have every right to use your words to express your emotional state and feelings to your partner.  What words you use in that conversation is what could cause you to be an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to see a counselor / therapist for your issues by yourself as part of your own mental well being.  You need to express how you feel to that therapist in an attempt to create good points and positions to then express those to your wife feeling like she's being beat up and sinking even further into depression.   Your mental health is critical not only for yourself, but for your child.\n\nWhile you may have a consistent workout and diet routine, your wife may find that struggle to much to handle.  You have to be supportive and reject the desire to comment or agree about her weight or lack of weight loss or even lack of desire you may have for her at this body weight.\n\nOne thing I can speak from with experience is mental health is sometimes tied to nutrition.  That can also help with the side effect of better health, including weight loss.  Something as simple as her walking with you and your child outdoors can also make strides for her well being.  You have a difficult situation and it's not going to be easy, but please keep up with couples counseling and seeing a therapist solo.", "NTA, but as you wrote yourself you take good care of your body to stay in shape. Which means you should know that you loose kilos in the kitchen, not in the gym. Henceforth diet together.", "NTA. You should not have to live in an unhappy, sexless marriage. And unless your wife decides to change this will be your life if you stay with her.", "NTA. You supported her, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should neglect your own emotional and mental health.", "Are you asking if YTA for bringing up her weight or for the larger picture?\n\nI mean, it's generally never a good idea to bring up weight unless the other person asks.  You're also sort of leaving out stuff, it feels like. You write, \"I said again that I think it \\[her weight\\] is a huge contributing factor for her depression. It's been uncontrolled weight gain the past few years.\" What do you mean, 'again'? Weight isn't a factor in depression; it's a symptom. The symptom needs to be dealt with. Is it?\n\n.That said, it does sound like she's fixating on this one comment about her weight and not on other things.  You mention you have a baby too? Do you think she has post partum? How are you each doing with this? \n\nBut the main thing is you're not her therapist nor are you a trained mental health professional. And it shows, to be blunt. She needs intensive support, both with eating disorder specialists and depression and anything else. You need therapy too, imo, especially considering your past depression and your difficulty in communicating your needs and the long term plan here\n\nI'm not sure why you think you're responsible for her mental health. You say you've gone to marriage counseling but is she going to therapy and taking meds as proscribed? That is, is she trying to get better on her end?  THis is above Reddit pay grade. It's not really YTA stuff because there are so many factors. \n\nAs far as communicating your own needs. Well yeah. You're a husband not a professional doctor. It's ok for a caregiver to be overwhelmed and frustrated and it also sounds like you have no long term plans. You wouldn't be TA to communicate this but it sounds like both you and her need more professional help.", "NTA", "NTA. Maybe you need to do some counselling on your own and figure out what you need and want. It sounds like this isn't much of a marriage and you need more than that.", "YTA for focusing on her weight. NTA for telling her how you feel as a carer rather than partner. I too am a carer for my partner, more intensely so as they have a terminal illness so I need to do everything for them as well as our young child. It\u2019s really hard.

A healthy marriage has expectations and boundaries on each person, both spoken and unspoken.   \n\nSome typical unspoken expectations in a marriage are giving loving attention to your partner at least somewhat regularly and taking reasonable care to maintain a healthy body.   This is bare minimum stuff, and there should be consequences for not holding up her end.  \n\nYou're not helping her by letting her ignore her responsibilities in the relationship.

The difference is I always try to check in with his mental health too because I know it has to be hard on him. From your post, it sounds like your wife doesn\u2019t do that. It also, and this may be harsh, sounds like she isn\u2019t trying to pull herself out of it. When my weight depresses me, and it has often in the past, I push myself through to work on it.

However, her weight should never be something you focus on. If you love her then you love ALL of her. You don\u2019t love her because she is thin. That\u2019s shallow and frankly, horrible. If she mentions that she is unhappy with her weight then you need to help bolster her confidence, not make it worse with hurtful comments. Bodies change as we age and expecting her to look the same forever is unrealistic and harmful. Gaining weight is easier for women and loosing it is much harder when compared to men because we have different hormones. Do not compare her to yourself. That\u2019s unfair and unhelpful. I wouldn\u2019t want to have sex with someone if I was feeling super insecure and then they only enforced those feelings. All I\u2019d be thinking about the whole time we were doing it would be \u201chow fat do I look from this angle? Oh god is he disgusted by my cellulite? Ugh he just touched my stomach roll\u201d. That\u2019s not enjoyable, it\u2019s anxiety inducing. \n\nIt\u2019s good that she is in therapy and trying different meds, and it SEEMS like you do what you can to be supportive but some of your language makes me think you might not be as supportive as you think. You say she had some takeaways from couples therapy, but what were YOUR take always? You mention supporting her hobbies when she NEEDS time away\u2026 does she have regular activities that she gets to engage in beyond when she has reached a breaking point? You mention your non existent sex life and her weight\u2026 I\u2019ve already touched on this above but just remember you are not OWED sex. It must be shared in a safe and loving environment which it doesn\u2019t seem like she feels she has (also, some drugs can seriously yank libido). You mention not doing fun things together because you don\u2019t share interests\u2026 have you tried doing things that she likes with her instead of just sending her to do them alone? If she feels the effort there from you then maybe she will be willing to try things you like too. \n\nAlso, INFO: you didn\u2019t mention anything about household and child rearing responsibilities. In your post. Who does the majority of the house work and child care? Look VERY honestly at your situation and self assess. Does your wife do a disproportionate amount of these tasks? How do you help her?", "I can\u2019t judge, but\u2026 you can\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.

Maybe it is a contributing factor to depression, but if you know that her body image is something that she's struggling with, then yeah, commenting on it does make you the asshole. And losing it doesn't work for everyone. I dropped 100 lbs because I was told that would improve my mental health was more depressed after accomplishing that  \n\n\nYou are not the asshole for the frustration and emotions you are going through though.

He deserves to have someone he can do things with, connect with, be attracted to, and build a life with.

Part of what I'm struggling with is how involved to be with her own mental health journey and putting healthy pressure on her to change (or even if that's possible) rather than being toxic", "Sorry, I had to trim down a lot of it to meet the character count, so I'm sure my editing made some things confusing. From everything I've seen with her, it's a vicious cycle - she's depressed so she binge eats, hates her body for it, and in turn becomes more depressed. \n\nThat's the core of why I feel like the asshole here. She's struggling with weight as a complicating issue with regards to depression, and I brought it up as something that changes how attracted I am to her while she's in the middle of trying to develop a healthy body image. \n\nAnd part of me is like, it's normal to want to be attracted to your spouse, and when she's engaging in really physically unhealthy behavior part of me wants to keep my mouth shut, but part of me feels like it's okay to speak up and say how this is affecting our marriage. \n\nShe was depressed long before our child came along. When she took maternity leave, it was the happiest she'd been in years. Unfortunately, cost of living doesn't make a single income feasible.", "Thank you for your candor, and I'm really sorry to hear about your partner.", "In my unprofessional opinion, yes. And I've mentioned this to her multiple times. \n\nShe's a very rule-oriented person. She gets a lot of ideas stuck in her head about how things \"should\" be. This wasn't much more than a personality trait that could get annoying but wasn't super toxic until she started teleworking. \n\nShe's been stuck in the house working a very demanding job and has no social interaction. COVID hit a year later and made it all much worse. I think not having these little interactions with other people in any environment that softly reminds her that other people enjoy other things, do things their own way, follow their own paths, has just left her isolated and wrapping herself in more and more imaginary rules she just makes up in her head to make her life harder.", "She's been trying different medications to see what works, but is either really sensitive to side effects, or is just really pessimistic that they'll work. I've been on a regimen for several years that works fine. \n\nShe also sees a therapist regularly. I did back when things are bad, and started seeing one again after our child was born since it was a huge life change and I wanted to as preventative maintenance.", "Yes! It has been really good in some ways - particularly with her being hypercritical and micromanaging. \n\nI honestly don't know how it would help in a case like this. Maybe we're doing couple's therapy wrong, because I don't think us communicating is an issue here. I'm communicating my needs to her, and she's communicating her needs to me, it's just been a very, very long slog through depression. \n\nI am going to seek a therapist for me to speak to about all of this.

Thank you for your kind words", "Honestly everyone should see a therapist, well I say that after having only seen one therapist in my life so maybe there are shitty ones.\n\n  \nBut mine is great, and it's largely just a place you can talk to a professional who isn't involved in your personally or professional life about anything you need or want to, without any judgement.", "Totally agree.

Do you see yourself living the life you want with her as your partner? You only get one playthrough, at the end of your life will you look back at the decision to  stay in this situation with regret? \n\nNo one can really answer that but you. It doesn't seem like things are getting better and it's been years. Could you carve yourself out a fulfilling life if things with her never ever change?", "Sounds like she expects you to be therapist to her. She isn't doing therapy equals she isn't trying: she wants meds and to do no work  and for you to pick and carry on after her.\n\nNo my man. That is no life.", "Yes but that's her problem. It must be sorted between her and her team. There is no reasonable justification for taking it out on you in any way shape or form.", "Hey, has she had a blood work up since giving birth?\n\nBecause having kids really messed up my hormones, and getting them dealt with was a big step towards feeling almost like myself again.", "NTA, I totally get feeling like the partnership you thought you had, or wanted to have, is gone. It\u2019s sad and frustrating.", "Whatever she is doing is not working. It almost seems she doesn\u2019t *want* it to work! Have you considered whether the two of you are right for one another - given the permanent impasse?"]}
