By now, even though she is not on the lease, she will have established residency so you likely will have to go through a more formal process. If you would like to give her one last chance, then have her sign something that clearly outlines the rules as well as consequences of breaking those rules (if in violation of the rules herein 30 days are given to find new residence or something along those lines.) If you decide to go the eviction route, make it in writing, and preferably in a way that shows she received the notice (return receipt if by mail, or confirmation receipt if by email) so that if the time period passes and you have to start formal eviction procedures through the court you have a paper trail that she is aware that she was told to leave in a certain time frame. If it comes to that point there is also the more informal cash for keys concept to get her to leave, although again have her sign something that states she took that option so that she can\u2019t come back and say \u201cthey kicked me out illegally\u201d", "This and also think about you and the other roommates, it's not fair for you and them, if she stays", "I was planning on giving her 30 days to figure out a plan.", "That is a brilliant idea. Thank you", "Yeah I forgot to mention that, but we have had several discussions about it. She always says she\u2019ll start respecting us/the space, but then she\u2019s back at it 2 days later.", "If anything the lease makes it harder to kick her out, we technically aren\u2019t even supposed to have other people living here so I can\u2019t bring my landlord into it.

Just stay strong and make it very clear it's a non-negotiable.", "I wanna add that I was like her. I crashed onto my best friends couch and lost all care in the world for some time.

Even if she doesn\u2019t have a job, you should insist that she pays her fair share because this will motivate her to find any job until she can find one that she likes.

She has a sugar daddy that has been assisting her with rent. However, she does not have set employment and has not since moving in.", "Sounds like it's time for a meeting with all of the roommates.

Some have clauses specifically stating the others not on the lease cannot live there. By having someone not on the lease live there, you and your other roommates might be in jeopardy. That by itself is cause for the having the not-so-welcome person to leave. Perhaps her sugar-daddy will help her find another place to live.", "Give her time to get her crap in order. At least 30 days! Just can't put her out on the street. She's not working don't have family I hope this go well! Good luck!", "NTA, but write up a form of a lease and have a witness verify and sign.

Have you all got together and talked to her about it? You are definitely justified in wanting to kick her out."]}
