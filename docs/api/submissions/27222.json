It\u2019s definitely not good, but very different from hooking up with someone else or even emotionally cheating.

Making out with a dude after a breakup isn't cheating, even if you get back together with the ex afterwards. \n\nThe opportunity he had to limit your dating life was *when you were dating him*.

Him telling you that you're broken up but you can't do the things that a single person normally does is controlling. He's manipulating you by saying you can't do these things or it's over.

Your ex is being extremely controlling and manipulative. If you cannot put yourself out there and talk to other guys, then what exactly is the point of breaking up?

He wants you when it\u2019s convenient for him, but when are your feelings going to be brought into consideration?

If my bf now asked to go on break, that would be the end for me.\n\nYou need to block him cause he will consistently go on break with you, cause he is going through something, stop feeling sad for him and think about your own feelings and be selfish. This is a master manipulator.", "When I was 19, my gf and I broke up. She tried to use this kind of BS. \"If you sleep with anyone, it's over forever.\" That pissed me off how she tried to control me.  I hooked up with a girl that I knew liked me the next day and she saw us out together by random chance. The very next night, she was calling me trying to make up.

He is playing the yo-yo game with you.", "Of you were flirting with other guys and the first thing you did when on a break was to hook up with someone else, you cleary are not that into him.

Don't let him manipulate you into waiting for him, it is NOT fair to you.

Flirting and talking to other guys isn\u2019t cheating, for starters.

It's no longer any of his business, and what he's doing is NOT okay.  If he tries to control you, tell him off harshly and clearly.", "NTA. Once you are broken up, everything about your dating life is only your business. You are no longer a couple. You made no promises to each other.\n\nYou lost his trust when you cheated. Forgiving is not forgetting. He never forgot. It's hard to overcome infidelity.\n\nWhen you are on a break, it isn't a license to hook up, make out, whatever. It is meant to give each other some space and not have the stresses of a romantic relationship on you for a while. If either party makes out or dates others, it is a violation of the trust that comes with going on a break from each other. A break means you want to get back together after sorting through some personal stuff. It doesn't mean one person gets to have fun while the other sorts through their stuff.", "Even if he is your boyfriend he has no right to dictate that you can or cannot talk to people. Flirting is another thing. \n\n\nBUT HE ISNT YOUR BOYFRIEND RIGHT NOW AND HE HAS NO RIGHT TO DEMAND ANYTHING FROM YOU!!!!!\n\nHe dumped you. You are not his property and you have no reason to obey him as if you were. Do not let him treat you as something convenient that he can pick up and throw away as he wishes.

But seriously, NTA. If you broke up, he doesn't get to dictate what you can and can't do. You can still support him as a friend, but you shouldn't have to walk around on eggshells for the rest of your life to see if he will or won't get back together with you.", "NTA but he seems like he AH.

If he does? Then he is controlling.  \nDo what you need to do and stop centering him. You are broken up and therefore have no obligation to him.", "NTA.  If you are broken up, you are broken up.  He can't put any stipulations on what you do.\n\nIt sounds like he wants you to make the decision to stand by and wait for him while he is grieving, which is why he's leaving it up to you.  And if you don't, he doesn't ever want to get back with you.  Honestly, it doesn't sound like you were that committed to him anyway.", "NTA, but he's clearly not the one for you.  Stop letting him dictate your life when he's broken up with you.  He doesn't get any say in your life if he's not your partner. Who's to say he's not \"talking\" to other people as well since he's technically single now.", "I think NAH. He clearly still wants a relationship at some point, and he may be seeing this as more of a *break* than a full out *break up* since y\u2019all are saying you may get back together some day. He probably doesn\u2019t want to hold onto that hope when you\u2019re seeing people and possibly going to fall for one of them, and then he ends up hurt because he\u2019d still been hoping to be with you again. So, if you\u2019re seeing other people, he wants to decisively move on. That\u2019s not unreasonable I don\u2019t think.\n\nI also don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable that you see it as being fully broken up and you\u2019re free to see other people. You don\u2019t want to wait around on a maybe, and that\u2019s really valid- especially as he\u2019s *said* he doesn\u2019t want to hold you back. He literally told you it\u2019s alright with him. I think this is just a case of needing to decide what you want here OP- if you want to possibly be with him again, hold off on seeing others. If you don\u2019t, then go ahead. He\u2019s just communicating his boundaries for any future possibilities, so you have to decide if that\u2019s something you can abide by, or if you want to leave. Neither of you are being unreasonable or an AH though, it just seems like conflicting wants.", "Why would you be on? Are you asking if you can't ever date or talk to people again?\n\nI'm confused", "NTA about this situation, you\u2019ve broken up and you can do what you want.\nI\u2019m just surprised he stayed with you since you already cheated on him in the past though. Maybe this insecurity comes from that.", "ETAH, both of you for being in this situation. You got dumped, game over. You continue to play along.. You also said you cheated by flirting? There\u2019s no such thing. \n\nBoth of you clearly don\u2019t know how to define your relationship or togetherness.\n\nYou are either together or not\u2026\n\nLastly, people don\u2019t go on Tinder to talk to people.. grow up.", "Both are assholes. You for cheating him for being controlling.", "NAH. All kinds of people saying he's being \"controlling,\" but really all he did was give the choice to you. If you don't want to to wait around, then go. \n\nAll he said was he doesn't want to get back together with you if you get involved with someone else. That's just saying what he'd do. Granted, his definition of getting involved with someone else is pretty immature, but you guys are 20, so of course you're immature.\n\nReading between the lines, if he's saying things like you'll \"break up permanently\" if you talk to other guys - what the hell even is \"break up permanently?\" Was there some expectation that you'll get back together otherwise? Is that something you were considering? If so, it sounds like he's confused about whether he actually wants to break up and probably doesn't know what the hell he's doing. So in any case, if you dont want to go, you'd best have a talk about that instead of playing this stupid limbo game.", "These ppl in the comments just ignored how she admitted on cheating on him \ud83d\udc80 yes you are TAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From the outside looking in, it feels like he wants the benefit of having a girlfriend without the commitment and the label. So gets to call you when he's sad, hurt, etc and you stay single, but he goes to the club with his buddies.\n\nYou can wish him well, want the world for him without having to be there. He has other people in his life that step up for him, he can go for grief counselling, he can learn to deal with his emotions on his own. \n\nAll I'm saying is that I don't think you have to be that person for him and that you don't owe him shit.

I think he's trying to have it both ways and you deserve better.", "What exactly in Catholicism is leading you to believe this is normal? Even hardcore, I don't see it. Go talk to a priest, I suspect they'll say that's weird, too. Like... you and your... not-ex? have not been joined by a Sacrament.

Altman, calls the pope \u201cBergoglio\u201d, etc.)? \n\nIf he is the type of man who believes women should not go to school after high school, should not wear pants, expects a wife to be a SAHM and never work, etc., be very leery. I\u2019ve had multiple friends who have gotten into relationships with RadTrad young men and been both emotionally and spiritually abused due to the unrealistic expectations of the boyfriend. Most of these women ended up marrying good and faithful Catholics, but ended up leaving the TLM Catholic lifestyle. \n\nI would also recommend you have the ability to live independently (have a job, life skills. etc.) before you get married, even if you live with your parents until your wedding. I\u2019ve had friends who were the primary wage earners in a marriage for years until children came along due to the husband finishing their college education or being early in their career. I\u2019ve also had multiple stay at-home moms whose husband had career-ending health crises in their 40s, forcing the women to go into the workforce with no higher education and little work experience.", "When you break up with someone but then tell them if they essentially have any engagement with other guys you'll never, ever, date them again - that's controlling AF.", "Did you want to make out with this guy?

That's some gas lighting to justify his controlling ways.\n\nRed flags, girl. Red flags.", "No no, he is using that to control you. You\u2019ll never be this young again. I wasted a ton of time in college with a guy who kept me on the hook. Stop speaking to him and be single.", "But he hasn't been good to you either? I lost a parent close to the same age, and no amount of grief excuses this kind of control. He broke up with you. He gets ZERO say in your life now. You are so young. Who you are now only vaguely resembles who you'll be in even five years. You need to go out and meet other people. Learn who you are without him. If, by some slim chance, you two are actually meant to be,  he'll realize one day that he was in the wrong for his ultimatum, *apologize*, and you can try again when you both are more mature and experienced.", "Let's review what you wrote.  In less than 2 yrs you:\n\n* \"...made out with a guy because we were on a break...\"  \nYou didn't try to heal, or make yourself a better person, or take some time to focus on yourself, you jumped on another guy.\n* \"...cheated on him in the past by flirting with other guys while we were dating...\"  \nI really don't need to add commentary to this one.\n* \"...downloaded tinder and starting talking to guys...\"  \nAgain, you didn't take time to focus on yourself, just jumped on other guys.\n\nLet's not get it twisted.  I'm not judging you.  The 1st and 3rd items you were broken up, so you were free to do whatever you wanted.  Its just telling that instead of focusing on yourself, you quickly went to someone else.  I find it difficult to believe you were ever really committed to him if you so quickly moved on.\n\nYou say you're both still so young, so I attribute much of this behavior to immaturity.  But you need to be real with yourself.  He is never getting back with you, and if he does, he will forever hold over your head anything you do while broken up.", "He's controlling you. You can't be broken up and not allowed to see other people. That's insane. Broken up is broken up.... while he is grieving his way you have the right to see what else is out there. Do what you want. If it's meant to be you'll get back together. A month from now or 10 years from now. He can't have it both ways. DON'T let him threaten you.", "You will find someone better who doesn't manipulate you. It's better for you to not get together again.", "No. His promises are empty. Maybe this maybe that. Also I bet you he still chats up girls. Move on with your life.", "Let me tell you the story of a lot of people who have been on the hook like you with their exes and one day their ex just told them they are getting married to someone else and they just wasted their youth on someone who doesn\u2019t love them.

He doesn\u2019t get to break up with OP, but then get mad when she does things a single person is allowed to do. You don\u2019t break up with someone while also saying you won\u2019t date anyone else while you\u2019re broken up. It sounds like he wants you to be his girlfriend while he stays single. If you truly believe you need to grow as people before you get back together, really break up. Go no contact and live your life without worrying about how he would feel about what you\u2019re doing.", "This made me chuckle", "This right here he has you on the hook but doesn't want to deal with you right now. This isn't a relationship even if you're 20. If my mom died I wouldn't then break up with my person! That's when you lean I to them.\n\nIt's either you're broken up or not and I highly recommend broken up.  Even if you care and love him and its hard and he acts like you're the worst person in the world. \n\nIt's his way of getting you to break up with him so he can blame you later is what it really sounds like.", "Guys who use their religion as a weapon to control women are such red flags.", "I went to the bathroom and he followed me. I was talking to him earlier. It is SA and it\u2019s awful to admit.", "No she commented that the \"make out\" was actually a guy following her into a bathroom and kissing her without consent.  If her bf is making her think that a sexual assault is cheating, then he is controlling and manipulative.", "Being assaulted is not cheating!!
