They essentially hate-crimed me every day, calling me a variety of slurs, stealing my things (including mobility aids!), etc. \n\nI had PTSD for a while after I left school and I haven\u2019t talked to her since. I also haven\u2019t talked to my parents, who let all of it happen and didn\u2019t care.\n\nAnna replied by saying she was trying to re-kindle our relationship by inviting me, and she says she\u2019s changed and she wants us to be as close as we once were (before she turned our entire school against me). She says that I should value my family more, and that I am an asshole for not even considering going to the wedding of my own sister, my twin. \n\nNow my family are all harassing me with messages demanding that I attend, and everyone i\u2019ve asked about the situation says practically the same thing: \u201cBut they\u2019re family!\u201d and \u201cYou need to value your sister more - we all did things when we were teenagers that we wouldn\u2019t do now.\u201d\n\nSo, reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1693979728, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bc45h/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_twin_sisters_wedding/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
