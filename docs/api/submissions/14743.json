My half siblings (two brothers, one sister) who I have never had contact with have recently all begun following me on instagram. I begrudgingly accepted their follow request and have not interacted with any of them. They seem to range from 15-24. I was unaware they existed until a few years ago. \n\nI was raised poor white trash, but I was lucky enough to go to a private high school and I faked it till I made it as far as getting out of that mindset/lifestyle. I did not graduate college but I established myself in sales and have a lucrative career, I\u2019m going to have my first six figure year in 2023. I\u2019m not happy but I\u2019m damn near close to it and I feel confident for my future and the life I can provide for my future children when I\u2019m ready. I want to be able to give my kids a better environment than I had growing up. \n\nI\u2019m private on instagram and the younger of the two boys keeps unfollowing and following me to try and get my attention. I get the feeling he will be reaching out soon, but I honestly have no intention of meeting them at this current juncture in my life. I feel bad saying it, but they do not look well put together, greasy unwashed hair, trashy posts, and I know I won\u2019t have anything to relate to. My biological stuck around to raise them, and I hope for their sake they have good heads on their shoulders but I don\u2019t want anything to do with him or them. I don\u2019t want to be around people that will drag me back down to that level and I know it\u2019s a gross thought to have. \n\nIf he does end up messaging me am I an asshole for ignoring him, or am I an even bigger asshole for telling him I\u2019m not interested in starting a relationship with them currently. I\u2019m not saying one day I won\u2019t want to meet them, I can\u2019t blame them for their upbringing or circumstances but I worked my ass off to drag myself out of similar circumstances and at this current moment I\u2019m so focused on my career and having my shit together that I don\u2019t want to be around people who don\u2019t have the same mindset. \n\nTLDR: my half siblings seem to be trying to get my attention and I want nothing to do with them because I view them as white trash.", "created_utc": 1681432330, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ld4kg/wibta_if_i_turned_down_my_half_siblings_attempt/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think they're going to cast a spell on you and drag you down; you can still keep a little distance. You may end up being a positive role model for them, and help them avoid the fate that you've been struggling to avoid.", "NTA things could change in the future though. A friend of mine found out he had a brother, nothing in common with each other so they had no desire to meet. A few years later his niece reached out to him because her dad disowned her for being gay. They have a great relationship. Brothers a definite dud though.", "Honestly NTA and your honesty is refreshing because it\u2019s true no matter how others want to convince themselves it\u2019s not. The quality of your life is directly correlated to the quality of people you surround yourself with. It\u2019s not easy to move socioeconomic status the way you have (no matter what the \u201cpull yourself up by the boot straps\u201d boomers say). Your success is your success alone. You\u2019re not required to throw a life raft to people you don\u2019t know. They might be relatives but they aren\u2019t your family. Worse case scenario, by getting to know them your opening yourself up to the possibility of being guilted into financially helping them out.", "NTA. The cool thing about being an adult is having some control over who we spend time with. Yes, there are exceptions (workmates we can\u2019t avoid, racist Uncle Gary, etc) but as grown ups, we get much more choice than we did as kids. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to spend time with or meet your siblings if that\u2019s not what you want. Being produced by the same genetic donors does not make us automatic besties. Change your privacy settings and move on with the amazing life you\u2019ve created for yourself- you don\u2019t owe anything to the other people in this scenario.", "Technically you're NTA. Though you sound very \"holier-than-thou\". You said you \"faked it til you made it\" in private school, also that you're about to have your first 6 figure year but you aren't happy. You don't sound like you were raised poor lol. And if you really were, then you took \"fake it til you make it\" a little to literal because you kinda sound fake af.", "NTA, there's alot of effort required to ensure the relationship won't go south. I get a strong feeling that you'll get some loan requests soon\n\n> I faked it till I made it as far as getting out of that mindset/lifestyle\n\nDefinitely kudos for that.", "NAH. The people we surrounded ourselves with have enormous impact on us. I\u2019m glad you dug yourself out of a difficult situation, and I\u2019m happy that you realize that money does not buy happiness. \n\nIf and when you\u2019re ever ready to have a relationship with your half siblings, I hope it works out.", "NTA. It's okay to not want anything to do with them. If they press, just say that you aren't interested. But you should know better than anybody that appearances can be deceiving. aka faking it til you make it.", "NTA. Blood relatives are never entitled to have a spot in your life because they want it. Degrading them before meeting them is rude, but given the circumstances 100% understandable, and I completely understand. You are putting yourself first which should always happen. They could set you back with a lot of drama, trauma, and bs. So you\u2019d have to be prepared for that if you accept the invite to their lives. \nI am no contact with my father so I see where you are coming from in ways. You need to protect the life you\u2019ve built for yourself.", "Nta.", "Nta for not wanting no contact your an adult and have that right however YTA for your judgement of them when you know nothing off them except a  couple of instrgram post if you wanted dno contact why check them out in the first place you judgement of that your better than them is sickening", "NTA in regards to not wanting a relationship with them.

I took everything written into consideration and I appreciate the honesty in the advice given. \n\nSome people took my surface level assessment to heart, I agree I am an asshole for judging them this harshly and I acknowledged that in my post.

The bald statement that you don't want to start a relationship with them does not need to include any of your self-hatred about being white trash or your evaluation of their appearance or your thought that they might drag you down. A polite statement that you like your life as it is and don't want to start a relationship with people who are strangers to you is sufficient without any comments about social standing.\n\nTo the extent that they are being both understandingly interested in you and respectful of your space (no urgent messages), you would be a bit of TA if you completely ignored a request for further contact.", "NTA but it might do some good for both sides if you just hear them out. It may not be as bad as you think. You say you\u2019re not happy but normally people are happier when they have people who care about them in their lives. You have siblings and one of them cares enough to try and get into your life\u2026", "Yta for judging rhem before meeting", "NAH, no one will blame you for not wanting to reconnect with a part of your family that was a bad history or trauma.  Them wanting to reach out is also normal.  Had you not been so judgmental of them, I would have stopped there.  But you seemed to have a lot of preconceptions cuz these dudes fit a certain stereotype, so to some extent I think you would benefit from meeting them to find out of that gut feeling of yours was right or if you jumped the gun.  See what they\u2019re really like, if they ask to meet set some boundaries right off the bat and just grab some lunch.  But if the possible benefits of that are outweighed by any personal trauma that would make doing this too uncomfortable, then obviously put yourself first.  \n\nSounds like you got your head on straight enough where no one\u2019s gonna \u201cdrag you down\u201d unless you let them, and if their interest in reaching out to you is sincere then you might even be a positive influence who could set an example of what it means to break out of that cycle.  It\u2019s okay to be indifferent, but it probably wouldn\u2019t kill you to grab lunch with the disclaimer of \u201cNot looking for familial relationship of any sort, just wanted to oblige your request to meet each other\u201d.  If at any point they get sketchy or the vibe feels too off just disconnect and you\u2019ll be in the same place you were before, except now you know for certain what\u2019s up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would suggest you do what's right for you. Reaching out is just that. It does not need to be reciprocated. Just think through the ramifications of choosing no contact. Look forward 30 years.

You wouldn\u2019t need to keep them in your life, but you might want to consider being honest with them why you didn\u2019t reach out, what you were doing, and why you had these boundaries.
