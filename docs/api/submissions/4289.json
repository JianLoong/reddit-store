Even though Elle and BIL are divorced, I still see her as my SIL. BIL divorced her, I didn't, we are still very close and refer to each other as our SIL.\n\nLast month I (40F) joined Facebook as one of my siblings is moving abroad next year and I want to keep in contact with them. Elle is in a relationship with James (40M). Elle has recently announced on social media that she is pregnant with the 3rd child (she and BIL have twins), she is due in March. She had posted it on her social media, which she does not have Julie or BIL on. I have added Julie and BIL, to keep the peace with in the family but Elle has shown me how to change the settings on posts so if I want to post something that has her in it then Julie and BIL can't see it.\n\nI have started to crochet and knitting for Elle's new baby. For the twins I made blankets, and I made the hats and cardigans that they came home in. I wanted to do the same for the new baby as well as I know Elle has kept these items for her children and I don't want my new niece of nephew to feel left out. I posted a picture of the hat I had made for the new baby on one of my children's teddies. I captioned it that 'Very excited to be knitting and crocheting for a new family baby and am excited to become an aunt again.' I didn't tag anyone it in, I didn't say who was having the baby or anything. As I hadn't mentioned Elle in it at all, I figured it would be safe to let BIL and Julie see it.\n\nWell Julie commented underneath the post demanding I took it down, furious that I had dared to post about her being pregnant. I had no idea that she was pregnant. Julie never struck me as wanting children as she is so cold with the twins and my children. BIL and Julie have now been contacting me and Husband (40M), demanding that we take the post down, telling us that we should know better than to announce someone else's pregnancy. Julie has said that we are making her sick with stress as she didn't want it to be announced this early. Julie is 7 weeks pregnant. I haven't said anything to BIL or Julie about Elle being pregnant as I know Elle wouldn't want them to know. I have left the post up, but have told Julie and BIL that the post wasn't about them and that I'm not just an aunt to their future child and that I have siblings who could also be expecting.\n\nI feel like I might be the asshole as my post has accidentally revealed that Julie is pregnant even if it was revealed by Julie herself. I feel bad about it as I know how stressful those early weeks can be, with worrying that everything is ok before your 12 week scan.\n\nEdit: Both my sister and Alice - my SIL (Brother's wife) are pregnant. BIL is my husband's younger brother. Apologies for not adding this, I didn't think it was important. The twins are excited for their new sibling but haven't seen their dad in ages. I woke up this morning to see that Julie's comments have been deleted off my post and a message from her just saying sorry. This isn't normal Julie behaviour, I have never known her to apologise for anything. My sister called me this morning to ask if Julie had apologised to me, I asked her how she knew Julie had messaged me. Turns out, she had seen the post, knowing it the hat was for Elle but had messaged Julie angrily having a go at her for making a big deal over a hat for my sister's baby. She told Julie that she hadn't announced it yet and had told me that if I was posting to make it vague. My sister hasn't announced publicly she's pregnant, as she isn't that much further along than Julie. I know because she has severe morning sickness and she reached out for help as I was the same with my last. My sister knows I don't have a good relationship with Julie.", "created_utc": 1670546211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zghk0t/aita_for_accidentally_revealing_my_sil_is_pregnant/", "score": 2234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
