It says a lot more about Julie than about there being anything inappropriate or identifying in the post that she would just *assume* it was about her despite there being literally no way for you to know unless someone else blabbed first - and if she hadn\u2019t told anyone in the family, that someone would have to be BIL, so I don\u2019t know where *he* gets off throwing you under the bus.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t even know!

So if she and your BIL hadn\u2019t told you, there would have been no way the post could have been about her when you didn\u2019t know. She\u2019s just being irrational and they\u2019re out of line. \n\nFurthermore, you did the right thing keeping Elle\u2019s pregnancy a secret from them. It\u2019s her business, not theirs. You don\u2019t owe them any name or further details.
