It\u2019s probably very insensitive given one of them can\u2019t go\u2026 but these are 13 year old boys. I personally wouldn\u2019t jump to bullying.

But she's not their parent so she doesn't get to decide that.   It was fine for her to reach out and ask you but ultimately, it's your decision to go along with it or not.  Hopefully your son never participated in the rubbing of Nick's face in that though since he was upset they did it, I doubt he did.\n\nIt's too bad you can't find a way to include Nick.  It'd be nice if all the parents threw in to purchase him a plane ticket too.  Is there any way to do that?  There are some fairly inexpensive airlines out there, like Spirit and Frontier in the US.", "NTA approach her again and explain that she can take the generous offer of paying for his ticket or she can explain to her son that he could have gone but she was too proud to take you up on the offer. She's the AH now. Make sure nick knows this or this is going to stick with him.", "NTA, that's Nick's mom for ruining his chance to go on vacation from misplaced pride, imho\n\nIt would have been way more tactful and face-saving to offer  paying for Nick's ticket ***before*** the other kids learned about the situation... and showed you who they were, but Nick's mother seems to have a boulder on her shoulder...", "NTA i think Nicks Mum is wanting the trip to be cancelled because then her son isnt the only one not going. She needs to teach her kid that sometimes life isnt fair. You need to teach your child, that its important to chose your friends wisely and to stick up for things that are wrong like bullying.
