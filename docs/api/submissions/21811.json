We see my dad, Donna and the daughter a few times a month. \n\nMy dad and I went to the lunch the two of us when he mentioned how nice it would be if donnas daughter is a bridesmaid as she \u201cloves the two of us so much\u201d.

I'd one up him, uninvite him... thanks, but no thanks, your presence is no longer required. Let him explain that. If you really want to be an AH post it on FB.

I have decided that if you are only willing to pay for the bar if you get your way here, then we simply won't be able to afford an open bar. I have already contacted Donna's daughter to explain that you jumped the gun, that, while we had considered the possibility of adding additional bridesmaids, we are limited to the 4 we have.  \n\nAt this point, I would like confirmation as to whether or not you still plan to attend.

Talk about including the girlfriend and her daughter in some wedding photos to throw out an olive branch.  \n\nNot saying you would, but for the love of God do not try to pin this on your fiance... This is your dad's hill to die on.\n\nIf that fails and your dad pulls the funding, make it a cash bar and put up a sign explaining why it had to be a cash bar.... Just kidding.", "Confused about how your deadpan be this manipulative but also a sap. its kind of looking like the only sap would be you if you entertain this idea.", "Nah, I've just gone into debt celebrating my friends' love lives.\n\nI understand where you're coming from. You can be honest and say you want to set boundaries with your dad and that you don't want her in the party. I get why you would want to deal with it yourself, but I think it's worth mentioning. Even if you say, \"Yeah, my dad wants his girlfriend's daughter in the wedding. I'll deal with it: I'm going to tell him 'no' because she is not special to us.\" Yes, it's her wedding, but it's yours too. Your happiness matters. You just won't be wearing the pretty dress.\n\nIf she wants to be a bridesmaid, I'm sure you can convince your dad to make sure she's in his wedding.", "All the more reason to talk to Donna.

I would recommend, if you feel comfortable to do so, explaining to him that this is a very inappropriate way of going about including Donna and her daughter, and he needs to respect you and you\u2019re fianc\u00e9\u2019s having decisions over these things.", "Well then the daughter can be her mom's maid of honour when dad marries.", "Yes I was thinking of doing beer and wine with a cash bar for liquor", "Yes if he brings it up again I will reiterate it\u2019s her decision and only her decision. He\u2019s pushing to add one more. Like framing this is a good thing for my fianc\u00e9 because then I could add her older brother too and all siblings can be in it.", "He threw out the idea of not paying for the bar anymore.

It can be really nice if you have friends and relatives who live far away to have a book that people can sign with best wishes for the couple. Usually a guestbook has an attendant.

She's an adult not a child, you do not lie by admission just because she's an easily stressed ppl pleaser.

You lied to Donna and now she's mad.\"\n\nAlso, let your fianc\u00e9 know what is happening. In a \"this is what my dad did, I'm dealing with it\" way. You know him better than I do, but if he's in deep enough would he try to go around you? Or would Donna reach out to talk about her daughter's involvement if your dad kept assuring her she was and she hadn't heard anything? You don't want to start your marriage hiding things, start it as a front united against your father steamrolling you instead or growing a spine and owning up to his mistake.", "NTA. Do not raise it to your fiancee, do not let your father guilt you into it.  This is your wedding, he promised something he can't deliver and never should have.

I told him that wouldn't happen, but wanted to let you know.\" Then maybe (if you like) you can arrange for corsages for Donna and daughter or some other symbol of inclusion that elevates them a bit above guest.   \n\n\nAlso, this might be your dad's problem to solve, but he doesn't sound like a problem solver to me, so reach out directly to Donna/daughter (maybe even in person at your monthly lunches) and say that 'Dad mentioned daughter being in the wedding party to me last week. I let him know that our parties are completely set already and I wanted to tell you in person. I'm very glad you are part of dad's life and make him so happy and I  wanted to be clear that are parties are small and set.

If it's a sweeter drink, you can line the rim of the glass with fruit sugar. \n\nhttps://livetosweet.com/2023/05/03/blueberry-sugar/\n\nRecipes there. It's just something a little different to stand out. Vanilla sugar on the rim of a fruit infused mojito would probably be stellar. \n\n>We see my dad, Donna and the daughter a few times a month.\n\nThat's a lot for someone your age. Your dad is harming a close relationship to suck up. His problem. NTA.", "NTA. I don't care how much of a pushover your dad is, he should not have made that promise, let him take back his money if needed. If there's anyone hurting that dad-son relationship, it's him", "NTA - if this woman starts adding bridesmaids to your wedding, where will this end?  \n\nYour father wants to get his leg over - fine but what compromises he needs to make are his business", "NTA\n\nPut her in charge of the guest book or something if you like but this is insane", "NTA. Your dad shouldn\u2019t be strong-arming you like this. It\u2019s incredibly manipulative and wrong.\n\nTell your dad if he is serious that you simply won\u2019t have a free bar, and you\u2019ll be sure everyone attending the wedding knows why. And that the daughter still won\u2019t be a bridesmaid, so he\u2019ll be taking heat from more than just Donna.\n\nThat\u2019ll cause some friction, but it\u2019s important for your dad to understand he can\u2019t pressure you into compliance. If you let him do it now he\u2019ll do it again and again (I imagine he\u2019s done similar things in the past too), despite the fact that you\u2019re an adult.\n\nTo be more peaceful just accept that he won\u2019t pay for the bar and do it yourself or don\u2019t have one, depending on your finances. Either way, giving in is the wrong move imo.", "I'm going to guess that it's Donna who started this, because it's women, not men, who harbor important feelings about weddings. If they're connected to the event in some way, they can get possessive, and perhaps Donna told OP's father to put her daughter in the wedding party.\n\nFather doesn't want to alienate her--who knows how steady this liaison is at best of times?--so he complied, caught between his ladylove and his son.\n\nHowever this works out, someone's going to be unhappy. But it might help to consider that--only if I'm right--it's Donna, not OP's father, who is pushing for this. Donna's daughter, for all we know, isn;t even interested in taking part.\n\nBut, OP, try to avoid having a cash bar. You do want happy guests.\n\nNTA", "[deleted]", "I never realized how many shades of gray and black there were until the 6th or 7th wedding where I couldn't wear the suits I owned because charcoal grey is different than dark grey which is different from Men's Warehouse's dark grey.\n\nI'm too poor for elegant parties, so I'm going to start wearing tuxes to go grocery shopping.", "What your dad did to you was very manipulative so I think he may bring it up to your fianc\u00e9. You may want to discuss it with her. She would find out anyway if he pulls funding for the alcohol.", "I got to my current age of 50 and have never been in a bridal party, well apart from my own wedding. I have managed to not get upset by it.", "Wow 36 you must be a really nice guy or a really rich guy.", "Agreed! Go dress shopping with her (if dad loves her and wanted her involved he might pay!) and give her a job. Maybe she can greet guests on the door for you or  she can hand out confetti to people. It's  the brides decision who the bridesmaids are though!\n\nAlso, she might feel super uncomfortable being in the wedding party. Like I've been invited to rehearsal dinners when my bf was a groomsman just because I was dating him and I didn't go because I didn't know the couple well enough to intrude (the other groomsmen we're single and I think they were just thinking about me having to travel separately). I just showed up at the wedding with the rest of the guests but always thanked them lots for inviting me, gave my partner a small bouquet of roses to give to  the bride from me at the rehearsal  but said I had a clash but I'd be there in time for the wedding. Ive done this twice and it's always gone down well. As I've then been invited back for things with the couple and become good friends after.", "NTA. Your dad is. Tell donna and het daughter that your sorry your dad lied to them but the wedding party had long been set and while they were welcome as guests to both the ceremony and reception (if that was the plan) the wedding party already does not include all of the people you'd like including immediate family who have been in her left longer than any of you.\n\nAlso tell your dad he's lucky to still have an invitation after this. If you don't choose not to uninvite them all anyway.", "He already told Donna and her daughter that we were \u201cfiguring it out, but planning on adding her\u201d - his problem for being presumptuous. He may be head over heals in love with Donna and wants to make her daughter feel like part of the family. But he cannot force this to happen.\n\nYou already made your choices. The End.", "NTA just wait until your dad tries to propose to his girlfriend at your wedding reception.", "NTA. \n\nThis is laughable.  Donna's daughter is in no way one of the most important people in your life.  You probably don't even know her super well.  Why would it even be considered?  Good for you for blocking this from your fiance.  Have a great wedding.", "NTA but....the girl is going to remember being \"uninvited\" to be a bridesmaid and feel very hurt.. She was told it was already a done deal and was excited to participate. That's on your dad.  It's your wedding of course but be prepared for some very hard feelings from her and her mother in the future. Really, what's the harm if dad is planning to marry her mother?", "NTA", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 probably doesn\u2019t know your dad\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s daughter that well and has the right to say who is in her wedding party.

Good on you for protecting your fiance and standing up for what you guys want. Maybe it's time to go around dad and explain to Donna that unfortunately her daughter won't be in the bridal party. If dad wants to pull the money he promised for the bar that's fine, let him.  Depending how you feel about it, you could rescind his and Donna's invite. \n\nDon't let this man push you around. It's not his wedding. It's yours and you both should have everything u want on your day. Plus Donna's daughter is 19, usually the bridal party is a big part of the Bachelorette party, a 19 year old can't contribute funds or even do any of those things (can't drink in the U.S.) and some clubs don't let you in at that age. \n\nI say stick to your guns. And congrats on your wedding! Enjoy it!!", "Man. This is the second parents writing checks that the bride won\u2019t cash.

Or escorting for girls if you have them? Not in the wedding party directly but still a special role. Or if your fianc\u00e9e is feeling generous perhaps going to the hen party (depending on how it is getting done) without being a bridesmaid? \n\nGiven you don't want to blow up your relationship with your dad it might be worth thinking about how you can pay lip service without her being a major role.", "[removed]", "Because his dad probably knows it's a shite idea but can't or won't say no to his girlfriend.", "Bad bot", "NTA\n\nHe doesn\u2019t seem interested in protecting his relationship with you, just his relationship with Donna. If you want to protect your fianc\u00e9e from all this you need to explain you your dad that if he doesn\u2019t drop it you will personally tell Donna and her daughter that your father lied to them.
