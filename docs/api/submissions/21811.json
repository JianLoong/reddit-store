We see my dad, Donna and the daughter a few times a month. \n\nMy dad and I went to the lunch the two of us when he mentioned how nice it would be if donnas daughter is a bridesmaid as she \u201cloves the two of us so much\u201d. I laughed and said that was all set, remember dad? But then I realized he was serious. Like he started throwing out ideas. Replace one of her friends, or we each add a person. I explained that I am absolutely not having this conversation with my fianc\u00e9 and it wasn\u2019t happening.

I feel a little bad for her daughter because it maybe sounds like she\u2019s being used as a pawn in this (I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case, though).

I'd one up him, uninvite him... thanks, but no thanks, your presence is no longer required. Let him explain that. If you really want to be an AH post it on FB.

Talk directly to Donnas daughter and say \u201chey, my dad is blackmailing me to add you to the wedding party. It\u2019s cool that he cares so much about you and your mom, and he really wants you to be happy, but my fianc\u00e9 and I have had our wedding party set for months, and we won\u2019t be adding anyone. I feel like you deserve to know there was never an invite from us, and so you not being in the wedding party isn\u2019t because of anything you did wrong. I don\u2019t know how my dad and your mom are going to react to not getting their way, but wanted you to have the full picture. We look forward to seeing all 3 of you as guests.\u201d If your dad chooses not to pay for the bar as a result, then you can save money by making it cash bar for the paternal family members that attend and cover the everyone else.", "Nta at all.  Tell him the no is final and that if he pulls the money for the bar over it then thats OK and it's his prerogative and you'll figure it out (and you will- cash bar; wine and beer only; etc...). The only people who should make decisions about a wedding are the people getting married.", "NTA\n\nTell him that the future stepdaughter can be Donna's bridesmaid but that you will NOT ask your fianc\u00e9e to include her.\n\nBe prepared that he won't pay for the bar--talk to your bride about this as it will affect your wedding budget.", "NTA. Why on earth would they tell the daughter without asking first?", "Nta, but you will need to find a way to pay for the bar and tell your dad that the bar is paid for so it\u2019s up to him to tell her she\u2019s not in the wedding.", "NTA. Just reach out to the daughter and explain your father jumped the gun, and that while it was a possibility at one point, but you weren't going to be adding any additional bridesmaids, we are limited to 4.\n\nThen speak.with or text/email your daf\nd. \"I get that you are stressed out over this situation, but you are basically extorting me now over this bar bill. You must really love Donna to be so vulgar, seeing as how tbis sort of behavior can end our relationship. I have decided that if you are only willing to pay for the bar if you get your way here, then we simply won't be able to afford an open bar. I have already contacted Donna's daughter to explain that you jumped the gun, that, while we had considered the possibility of adding additional bridesmaids, we are limited to the 4 we have.  \n\nAt this point, I would like confirmation as to whether or not you still plan to attend. Either way, we will need to sort out what sort of relationship, if any, we will have going forward, though that isn't something I will have the bandwidth to think through until after the wedding.\"", "NTA but definitely tell your fiance so she is not blindsided by your Dad, Donna or her daughter", "They seem pretty into eachother and my dad is talking of marriage so it seems like Donna will be around for awhile.

But the reason why I don\u2019t want to tell her is because I know she will feel bad and think she\u2019s hurting people by not including her.

I think this is more about my dads grand gesture to Donna rather than her actually wanting to be in it.", "Ha yeah what\u2019s the saying about funerals and weddings being where people get hurt the most. She\u2019s also 19 she\u2019s got plenty of time to be in a wedding.", "But to add, if you feel sorry for the step, you can have her do a reading, read a poem, guest book, something like that.", "My dad can get excited sometimes", ">Still my wedding isn\u2019t the place for my dad to show his love for Donna.\n\nSAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK!

I\u2019ve been in similar situations with my father & his partner(s). It\u2019s simply not the situation or appropriate for him to ask this of you guys. It\u2019s frankly pretty ridiculous & rude.

It\u2019s your (and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s) day - no one else\u2019s. \n\nSide note: although it may seem serious\u2026my dad had a few Donna\u2019s (one was actually named Donna lol) and they didn\u2019t last. The last thing you want is a random girl in all your photos & intimate wedding moments.", "Re the bar $$ thing. If dad pulls out, it can be much cheaper if you offer beer and a signature cocktail (also maybe a fancy mocktail) with enough sparkling wine for a toast, than to have a full bar.", "Maybe you can just talk to your dad's girlfriend with him and explain we talked through it but just could not make it work but really want them both there.  Talk about including the girlfriend and her daughter in some wedding photos to throw out an olive branch.  \n\nNot saying you would, but for the love of God do not try to pin this on your fiance... This is your dad's hill to die on.\n\nIf that fails and your dad pulls the funding, make it a cash bar and put up a sign explaining why it had to be a cash bar.... Just kidding.", "Confused about how your deadpan be this manipulative but also a sap. its kind of looking like the only sap would be you if you entertain this idea.", "Nah, I've just gone into debt celebrating my friends' love lives.\n\nI understand where you're coming from. You can be honest and say you want to set boundaries with your dad and that you don't want her in the party. I get why you would want to deal with it yourself, but I think it's worth mentioning. Even if you say, \"Yeah, my dad wants his girlfriend's daughter in the wedding. I'll deal with it: I'm going to tell him 'no' because she is not special to us.\" Yes, it's her wedding, but it's yours too. Your happiness matters. You just won't be wearing the pretty dress.\n\nIf she wants to be a bridesmaid, I'm sure you can convince your dad to make sure she's in his wedding.", "All the more reason to talk to Donna. NTA.", "I think it\u2019s very kind and reasonable for you to invite them. And I can see that your dad has kind intentions, but I definitely don\u2019t think he went about it the right way.\n\nWould you feel comfortable telling him that, your fianc\u00e9\u2019s bridal party is her decision and he cannot make decisions about it, but that you are happy to have her and Donna there to celebrate with you? I would recommend, if you feel comfortable to do so, explaining to him that this is a very inappropriate way of going about including Donna and her daughter, and he needs to respect you and you\u2019re fianc\u00e9\u2019s having decisions over these things.", "Well then the daughter can be her mom's maid of honour when dad marries.", "Yes I was thinking of doing beer and wine with a cash bar for liquor", "Yes if he brings it up again I will reiterate it\u2019s her decision and only her decision. He\u2019s pushing to add one more. Like framing this is a good thing for my fianc\u00e9 because then I could add her older brother too and all siblings can be in it.", "He threw out the idea of not paying for the bar anymore. Trying to blackmail you. Well dad I throwing out the idea of disinviting you and your gf and her daughter. NtA.", "NTA. \n  This day, out of any, is you and your fianc\u00e9s day. Not anyone else\u2019s and nobody has the right to intrude on that. Stand firm. He made the bed, let him lie in it. \n\nI do feel sorry for her though. She didn\u2019t deserve to be lied to and mislead.  He may have just damaged his future relationship with her, and possibly her mother.\n\n And things like this will keep happening if you don\u2019t hold boundaries.\n\n  In my wedding photos there are no less than 3 exes of family members.

It can be really nice if you have friends and relatives who live far away to have a book that people can sign with best wishes for the couple. Usually a guestbook has an attendant.

I have a sister who wanted to force me to add her boyfriend\u2019s child into a ceremony because he also \u201cloved\u201d us\u2026. I had only met the child once. I said no and stood firm. Fast forward they are no longer together.", "It concerns me that he is trying to use your wedding to pull a grand gesture for Donna.
