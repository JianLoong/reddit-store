We have a resource teacher that advocates for students with learning disabilities and physical or mental health issues that may need a little extra help in school. She works with the parents to create an accommodation plan, advocates for the students with teachers, and has a class for them to do their homework with tutors, take tests, or catch up on things they missed in class. \n\nThis teacher has a daughter in 6th grade with cancer. The school changed her schedule so she has 2 core classes in the morning, a free period, her mom\u2019s support class, then 2 more core classes in the afternoon. \n\nDuring her free period and her mom\u2019s support class, she usually naps in her mom\u2019s office, which is right behind her mom\u2019s classroom. It\u2019s usually not a problem but sometimes I or another teacher have to talk to her about one of her students and I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s appropriate to discuss their private information when a student is in the room. \n\nShe and I recently had a meeting about one of her students and her daughter was sleeping maybe 3 feet away from me. I asked if she could send her daughter to the nurse\u2019s office or her classroom but she said no because she didn\u2019t want to expose her kid to all of the germs in the nurse\u2019s office and there was a student taking a test in her classroom. She assured me that it was fine, her kid was asleep, and she\u2019s not going to hear anything. \n\nI told her I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about this student in front of her daughter and that we\u2019d have to postpone this meeting and either have it in my room, the library, or at a time when her daughter isn\u2019t in her office.
