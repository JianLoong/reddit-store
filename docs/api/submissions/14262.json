Like helping me pay student loans because I was the only one who had to take them out. I have never received help on those loans. I cautioned my wife of this as to not get her hopes up. Part of the planning was a dinner the night before the ceremony my mom told my wife they would pay for it bc we wanted to be cheap and she didn\u2019t. Come to find out they did pay for it but using the money they were gifting us. My mom said it wouldn\u2019t be apart of that money which is why my wife initially agreed to it. My wife felt like she was lied to so my mom could attend an event to her standards not ours. \n\nMy mom used the same logic of \u201cI was just so excited and wanted it to be special.\u201d The only thing I can say is set boundaries with her now. Make sure your partner backs you up and is firm when you set them. My wife unfortunately didn\u2019t think my mom would blatantly mislead her (or lie) like that. She now knows. My mom loves us and is genuinely over the moon that my wife is apart of the family. We still are having to set boundaries and take things with a grain of salt because that is how my mom is. \n\nIt really sucks to have the rug pulled out like this and I\u2019m sorry they have done this to you.
