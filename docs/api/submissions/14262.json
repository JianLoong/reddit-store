Come to find out they did pay for it but using the money they were gifting us. My mom said it wouldn\u2019t be apart of that money which is why my wife initially agreed to it.

In Jan she quit her job and got a new one but benefits didn't kick in for 3 months so we decided to move up the date and keep it between our parents", "Dear everybody,\n\nThanks so much for your good wishes and kind words for SO and I - but we'd like to ask for your help with something please - we need your cooperation.\n\nYou know we're planning a big celebration in '26 and, although well be doing legal formalities at the court house for various reasons, in our hearts and minds we'll be getting married for real at that celebration a couple of years from now - the special, public celebration where our families and friends will be able to stand with us and bear witness as we make our heartfelt vows.\n\nWhat we're asking from you, what we need, is for you to ignore the formality the at the courthouse. If you could help us hold the line, call us engaged, fiancees, all of the stuff, it would really help us. Because we would never want to celebrate our marriage without all of you being a part of it. The day we do it with you all is the day we are married in heart, in mind, and in reality. That's what counts for us - not the piece of paper.\n\nLooking forward to having you with us in '26!\n\nLove to you all, Us\n\n(Just a thought - it also takes the wind out of MIL's sails. Hopefully friends and family will shut her down on your behalf!)", "A friend had a secret wedding and kept it quiet because her mom said nobody would come to the big wedding if they knew. Some of us knew, some didn\u2019t. When word got out at the actual event some guests were pissed. NTA for being angry that she couldn\u2019t keep the secret but YTA for having such a ridiculous secret in the first place. Secret marriages are for soap operas.", "NTA\n\nReschedule that date.  Your fiance can buy private medical insurance since his Mom can't keep her mouth shut.", "If you do want some news to spread without having to call everyone, you know who to turn to.", "NTA but what\u2019s done is done unfortunately. You can be pissed about it but there\u2019s really nothing you can do about it as this point.  Don\u2019t let it fester inside of you or it will seep into your marriage. \n\nLet this be a lesson, do not tell her anything you don\u2019t want everyone else to know as well. It is what it is with her.  Her excitement is more important than your wishes so you know how to deal with her moving forward.", "NTA however I get her thought process of being excited. I\u2019d maybe try have a civil conversation like yeah we really didn\u2019t want people to know as we think of the big wedding as our actual wedding date and wanted to keep it that way", "I just came here to laugh about the \"whitnessesses.\" haha but yeah NTA", "NTA\u2014 head over to justnomil. The experienced people there will help you. Your going to need it!", "NTA. Best to play nice as she will probably be a big part of ur life for a long time but I would never tell her another secret again. \n\nA good but if revenge would be when/if you get pregnant don\u2019t tell her.  tell everyone u want to know first. Then tell the pol who you think she would blab to first and let her find out through a third party. U might not be able to do this though as I\u2019m sure ur husband will want to tell her but try if u can", "NTA", "NTA what she did was a betrayal of trust.", " NTA. And she is no longer FMIL, as you\u2019ve already gotten married. She\u2019s yours. Do set boundaries, as soon as possible. Forgive for the over-share, never share again. Do not let the sour your relationship with her, as she is excited to have you on board and in her sons life. She is going to push hard for babies, now. Typical grand-parent vibes. It\u2019s all ok, even now. People tell you who they are by their actions, believe them. Good luck.", "Remember this when/if you get pregnant. Don't tell her or tell her last.", "NTA.  But what are you trying to achieve by remaining mad at her? In future, just treat her as a broadcasting station.  She'll come in useful when you have a rumour to spread.", "NTA - and now you know just how little to tell her about any future pregnancies.", "Who here hasn\u2019t been pissed with their future or current MIL? NTA", "NTA, but if you really wanted to keep it a secret your family should have not been the ones to be your witnesses.", "NTA but I would ban her from the court house wedding. Instead of a big wedding, just elope somewhere nice and don't tell anyone until after. That way no one will be able to ruin it for you.", "nta, she sounds like the worst. it\u2019s not \u201clying\u201d to anyone to separate the legal/financial transaction from the wedding you\u2019re having in 3 years which clearly holds more social and emotional meaning. the real asshole is capitalism.", "NTA. It's somewhat stupid to sneak around with something like this, but is shouldn't matter, you told her to keep confidential and she breached.\n\nReminds me of my wife. She made me promise I wouldn't tell my family that she was pregnant. A few days later I was chatting with my brother when a mutual friend approached and congratulated me. Yes, you guessed it, wife told her family, her friends, everybody. Only I wasn't allowed to. Women are weird.", "NTA. But never trust her again.", "r/justnomil you may be a potential participant for this sub, im so sorry your FMIL ruined the lead up to what will be an amazing event regardless! you\u2019re NTA but these are the times to set firm boundaries", "NTA - the same thing happened to me. My fiance (F) and I (M) did a courthouse wedding last year for tax/insurance purposes since we got engaged in 2021 and aren\u2019t having our wedding til this December\u2026 her mother told people and my fiance was angrier than me. \n\nI don\u2019t know what your situation is but the way we described it was \u201cwe did the legal wedding already since it was easier but still don\u2019t consider ourselves married since the religious ceremony hasn\u2019t happened yet\u201d - most of our family and friends, even if they aren\u2019t religious, seemed to get it relatively quickly and are all excited for the December wedding.", "And I'll add... Be prepared for people to not prioritize your wedding because \"you are already married\". Unless you are doing a religious ceremony? In that case you maybe can argue that that is your real wedding.\n\nNTA. Forgive her if she apologizes. She just created a lot of problems if this was a secret, I get it. Other's will be mad they were not told, you have to tell those left out because there is no chance they will not find out in 3 years and the longer it goes the more hurt and mad they'll be", "What? Oh hell no, the MIL needs to realize the DIL is going to be her life a very long time.  She should not be forgiven.  She needs to call everyone and explain that she felt like ruining the wedding, she can not keep her big fat mouth shut and no one should ever tell her anything that should be kept secret.  In fact, she would be the very last person I would tell about being pregnant.  She knew what she was doing and wanted to exert power over the bride.  She could go to hell and stay there.", "My husband swore his parents to secrecy with our first kid (it was right before our first ultrasound) so naturally MIL told BIL, her sister and her own mother, which means the news then spread around the whole family. When my husband asked why she told them when he said it was still private she said \u201cwell, they were staying at the house so I had to tell them.\u201d With kid 2 we told them in person around 13 weeks and kid 3 even later, I think. We still withhold all sorts of information because we don\u2019t trust that it won\u2019t spread around the family.", "facts", "Exactly.", "She should ban her from the court house wedding. Her MIL needs to know actions have consequences and using the excuse she's happy to her as a daughter in law is lame. She's a gossip and cannot be trusted. Stand up to her now, otherwise she will make your life hell.", "Also, do not accept her excuse that she was just so excited.  I hate that excuse.", "Spoil it? MIL has already spoiled it.", "Completely disagree. \n\nMy wife and I were legally married at a courthouse after we got engaged due to some visa issues. We were already living together so it was very transactional. No one knew but us and our friend who was our future officiant.\n\nOur real wedding was held one year later, to the day, in my wife\u2019s hometown. It could have easily been 3. It\u2019s where we made our vows in front of all our closest friends and family to support each other, love each other, and be there for each other, forever. That is what marriage is all about, not just some silly paper signed by a stranger.\n\nAside from the occasional legal documents, that day, one whole year later, is the day I married my wife and that\u2019s the day we celebrate each year.", "That\u2019s a silly take. Rational adults with morals, a spine and a normal sense of privacy can keep secrets and mind their own business, and who cares? A secret means it\u2019s not your news to tell, ever, period. The wedding may seem farther away than the normal year or so people take to plan a wedding, but OP is very young, and they\u2019re saving and paying for things themselves, so it all sounds quite responsible. But to basically say \u201cwho could keep their mouth shut for three years?\u201d just shows you personally aren\u2019t trustworthy, it\u2019s not a reflection on their plans.", "Yeah dude. Don\u2019t tell her until after like 20w", "How'd she feel about that? Lol", "This is the way.", "Agree but you slipped from \u201cWe\u201d to \u201cI\u201d in your construction. This has to absolutely come from BOTH of them \u2014her husband best be on board or she is going to have a marriage full of grief with this MIL.  OP NTA", "Totally agree. The MIL showed her true self to be untrustworthy. I wouldn't give her a second chance.", "Well said \ud83d\udc4f", "It would be broadcast on the local radio.", "Live streaming it on her new YouTube channel.", "That's a silly take. \n\nMums love talking about their kids. It's not a super easy thing to keep private. The conversation of when and if her kid will get married is going to come up repeatedly over the next 3 years.", "He\u2019s 26 and doesn\u2019t have medical insurance. That\u2019s on him and not a failure of our healthcare system. ESH.", "She's allowed to feel anything she wants. She can strongly believe that her wedding is in 2026. \nBut since we live in a society where what she feels is not actual law, she is indeed legally married. They both are enjoying the perks of being married (health insurance,  perhaps taxes). And honestly, I don't think it's fair to keep family out of this. What if one of their uncles wanted to gift something big before the wedding to one of them, expecting it to be a separate asset? \n\nWeddings are not only about partys and dresses and showing off. OP is married. There is no point in telling herself otherwise.  And there is no shame in having a wedding in a courthouse before the big party. I really don't see the need to hide everything from your family because of the ceremony. It's sounds really immature.", "The point of a wedding is to get fucked up and see cousins you only see at funerals. Everyone knows that", "*post birth", "This is the way.", "This is the way", "Your to soft. The MIL is a gossip, who showed no respect and needs to be put in her place.", "Have you never kept a secret? You\u2019d just talk about the party they\u2019re planning. Or you say \u201cThey\u2019re doing well, they\u2019re living nearby, we see them every week for dinner, they got a promotion, and how are your kids doing?\u201d It\u2019s *very* easy to keep something private when you remember that it\u2019s *not your place to tell.*\n\nThis couple thinks of their planned date as their \u201creal\u201d wedding, and whether or not you agree with it, they asked *one* small thing of two supposed adults. One understood the assignment, and the other acted like a three year old. It\u2019s all well and good to advise never telling that MIL anything in the future, but let\u2019s not pretend that her behavior was okay, or that every mother is a gossip or a stereotype.", "How do you know they didn't look into it?", "The children can tell her when they get old enough.", "This is very selfish behavior on her part.  I think it\u2019s ridiculous that someone expect you to put up with this.  People who can\u2019t respect you are people that shouldn\u2019t be in your life.", "I don't that's why I asked in my first question.", "Let MIL notice that you had kids."]}
