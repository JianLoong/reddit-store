Like helping me pay student loans because I was the only one who had to take them out. I have never received help on those loans. I cautioned my wife of this as to not get her hopes up.

Come to find out they did pay for it but using the money they were gifting us. My mom said it wouldn\u2019t be apart of that money which is why my wife initially agreed to it.

In Jan she quit her job and got a new one but benefits didn't kick in for 3 months so we decided to move up the date and keep it between our parents", "Dear everybody,\n\nThanks so much for your good wishes and kind words for SO and I - but we'd like to ask for your help with something please - we need your cooperation.\n\nYou know we're planning a big celebration in '26 and, although well be doing legal formalities at the court house for various reasons, in our hearts and minds we'll be getting married for real at that celebration a couple of years from now - the special, public celebration where our families and friends will be able to stand with us and bear witness as we make our heartfelt vows.\n\nWhat we're asking from you, what we need, is for you to ignore the formality the at the courthouse. If you could help us hold the line, call us engaged, fiancees, all of the stuff, it would really help us. Because we would never want to celebrate our marriage without all of you being a part of it. The day we do it with you all is the day we are married in heart, in mind, and in reality. That's what counts for us - not the piece of paper.\n\nLooking forward to having you with us in '26!\n\nLove to you all, Us\n\n(Just a thought - it also takes the wind out of MIL's sails. Hopefully friends and family will shut her down on your behalf!)", "A friend had a secret wedding and kept it quiet because her mom said nobody would come to the big wedding if they knew. Some of us knew, some didn\u2019t. When word got out at the actual event some guests were pissed. NTA for being angry that she couldn\u2019t keep the secret but YTA for having such a ridiculous secret in the first place. Secret marriages are for soap operas.", "NTA\n\nReschedule that date.  Your fiance can buy private medical insurance since his Mom can't keep her mouth shut.", "If you do want some news to spread without having to call everyone, you know who to turn to.", "NTA but what\u2019s done is done unfortunately. You can be pissed about it but there\u2019s really nothing you can do about it as this point.  Don\u2019t let it fester inside of you or it will seep into your marriage. \n\nLet this be a lesson, do not tell her anything you don\u2019t want everyone else to know as well. It is what it is with her.  Her excitement is more important than your wishes so you know how to deal with her moving forward.", "NTA however I get her thought process of being excited. I\u2019d maybe try have a civil conversation like yeah we really didn\u2019t want people to know as we think of the big wedding as our actual wedding date and wanted to keep it that way", "I just came here to laugh about the \"whitnessesses.\" haha but yeah NTA", "NTA\u2014 head over to justnomil. The experienced people there will help you. Your going to need it!", "NTA. Best to play nice as she will probably be a big part of ur life for a long time but I would never tell her another secret again. \n\nA good but if revenge would be when/if you get pregnant don\u2019t tell her.  tell everyone u want to know first. Then tell the pol who you think she would blab to first and let her find out through a third party. U might not be able to do this though as I\u2019m sure ur husband will want to tell her but try if u can", "NTA", "NTA what she did was a betrayal of trust.", " NTA. And she is no longer FMIL, as you\u2019ve already gotten married. She\u2019s yours. Do set boundaries, as soon as possible. Forgive for the over-share, never share again. Do not let the sour your relationship with her, as she is excited to have you on board and in her sons life. She is going to push hard for babies, now. Typical grand-parent vibes. It\u2019s all ok, even now. People tell you who they are by their actions, believe them. Good luck.", "Remember this when/if you get pregnant. Don't tell her or tell her last.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA, but if you really wanted to keep it a secret your family should have not been the ones to be your witnesses.", "NTA but I would ban her from the court house wedding.

That way no one will be able to ruin it for you.", "nta, she sounds like the worst. it\u2019s not \u201clying\u201d to anyone to separate the legal/financial transaction from the wedding you\u2019re having in 3 years which clearly holds more social and emotional meaning. the real asshole is capitalism.", "NTA. It's somewhat stupid to sneak around with something like this, but is shouldn't matter, you told her to keep confidential and she breached.\n\nReminds me of my wife. She made me promise I wouldn't tell my family that she was pregnant. A few days later I was chatting with my brother when a mutual friend approached and congratulated me. Yes, you guessed it, wife told her family, her friends, everybody. Only I wasn't allowed to. Women are weird.", "NTA.

My fiance (F) and I (M) did a courthouse wedding last year for tax/insurance purposes since we got engaged in 2021 and aren\u2019t having our wedding til this December\u2026 her mother told people and my fiance was angrier than me. \n\nI don\u2019t know what your situation is but the way we described it was \u201cwe did the legal wedding already since it was easier but still don\u2019t consider ourselves married since the religious ceremony hasn\u2019t happened yet\u201d - most of our family and friends, even if they aren\u2019t religious, seemed to get it relatively quickly and are all excited for the December wedding.", "And I'll add... Be prepared for people to not prioritize your wedding because \"you are already married\". Unless you are doing a religious ceremony? In that case you maybe can argue that that is your real wedding.\n\nNTA. Forgive her if she apologizes. She just created a lot of problems if this was a secret, I get it. Other's will be mad they were not told, you have to tell those left out because there is no chance they will not find out in 3 years and the longer it goes the more hurt and mad they'll be", "What? Oh hell no, the MIL needs to realize the DIL is going to be her life a very long time.  She should not be forgiven.  She needs to call everyone and explain that she felt like ruining the wedding, she can not keep her big fat mouth shut and no one should ever tell her anything that should be kept secret.  In fact, she would be the very last person I would tell about being pregnant.  She knew what she was doing and wanted to exert power over the bride.  She could go to hell and stay there.", "My husband swore his parents to secrecy with our first kid (it was right before our first ultrasound) so naturally MIL told BIL, her sister and her own mother, which means the news then spread around the whole family. When my husband asked why she told them when he said it was still private she said \u201cwell, they were staying at the house so I had to tell them.\u201d With kid 2 we told them in person around 13 weeks and kid 3 even later, I think. We still withhold all sorts of information because we don\u2019t trust that it won\u2019t spread around the family.", "facts", "Exactly.", "She should ban her from the court house wedding. Her MIL needs to know actions have consequences and using the excuse she's happy to her as a daughter in law is lame. She's a gossip and cannot be trusted. Stand up to her now, otherwise she will make your life hell.", "Also, do not accept her excuse that she was just so excited.  I hate that excuse.", "Spoil it? MIL has already spoiled it.", "Completely disagree. \n\nMy wife and I were legally married at a courthouse after we got engaged due to some visa issues. We were already living together so it was very transactional. No one knew but us and our friend who was our future officiant.\n\nOur real wedding was held one year later, to the day, in my wife\u2019s hometown. It could have easily been 3. It\u2019s where we made our vows in front of all our closest friends and family to support each other, love each other, and be there for each other, forever. That is what marriage is all about, not just some silly paper signed by a stranger.\n\nAside from the occasional legal documents, that day, one whole year later, is the day I married my wife and that\u2019s the day we celebrate each year.", "That\u2019s a silly take. Rational adults with morals, a spine and a normal sense of privacy can keep secrets and mind their own business, and who cares? A secret means it\u2019s not your news to tell, ever, period. The wedding may seem farther away than the normal year or so people take to plan a wedding, but OP is very young, and they\u2019re saving and paying for things themselves, so it all sounds quite responsible. But to basically say \u201cwho could keep their mouth shut for three years?\u201d just shows you personally aren\u2019t trustworthy, it\u2019s not a reflection on their plans.", "Yeah dude. Don\u2019t tell her until after like 20w", "How'd she feel about that? Lol", "This is the way.", "Agree but you slipped from \u201cWe\u201d to \u201cI\u201d in your construction.

The MIL showed her true self to be untrustworthy. I wouldn't give her a second chance.", "Well said \ud83d\udc4f", "It would be broadcast on the local radio.", "Live streaming it on her new YouTube channel.", "That's a silly take. \n\nMums love talking about their kids. It's not a super easy thing to keep private. The conversation of when and if her kid will get married is going to come up repeatedly over the next 3 years.", "He\u2019s 26 and doesn\u2019t have medical insurance. That\u2019s on him and not a failure of our healthcare system. ESH.", "She's allowed to feel anything she wants. She can strongly believe that her wedding is in 2026. \nBut since we live in a society where what she feels is not actual law, she is indeed legally married. They both are enjoying the perks of being married (health insurance,  perhaps taxes). And honestly, I don't think it's fair to keep family out of this. What if one of their uncles wanted to gift something big before the wedding to one of them, expecting it to be a separate asset? \n\nWeddings are not only about partys and dresses and showing off. OP is married. There is no point in telling herself otherwise.  And there is no shame in having a wedding in a courthouse before the big party. I really don't see the need to hide everything from your family because of the ceremony. It's sounds really immature.", "The point of a wedding is to get fucked up and see cousins you only see at funerals. Everyone knows that", "*post birth", "This is the way.", "This is the way", "Your to soft. The MIL is a gossip, who showed no respect and needs to be put in her place.", "Have you never kept a secret? You\u2019d just talk about the party they\u2019re planning. Or you say \u201cThey\u2019re doing well, they\u2019re living nearby, we see them every week for dinner, they got a promotion, and how are your kids doing?\u201d It\u2019s *very* easy to keep something private when you remember that it\u2019s *not your place to tell.*\n\nThis couple thinks of their planned date as their \u201creal\u201d wedding, and whether or not you agree with it, they asked *one* small thing of two supposed adults. One understood the assignment, and the other acted like a three year old. It\u2019s all well and good to advise never telling that MIL anything in the future, but let\u2019s not pretend that her behavior was okay, or that every mother is a gossip or a stereotype.", "How do you know they didn't look into it?", "The children can tell her when they get old enough.", "This is very selfish behavior on her part.  I think it\u2019s ridiculous that someone expect you to put up with this.  People who can\u2019t respect you are people that shouldn\u2019t be in your life.", "I don't that's why I asked in my first question.", "Let MIL notice that you had kids.", "I dunno where you live but in the US many states will let you claim insurance benefits based on common law marriage. My husband and I did this in California once we'd lived together six months- no legal wedding, just a notarized statement. Every state has different rules about what constitutes \"common law\" marriage. Iirc in Texas (where we lived next) as long as both parties agree they're married they can claim to be common law spouses.\n\nWe got for-real married many years later.", "Esh.  I\u2019m going to be honest.  My brother tried to do what you did, but once you\u2019re married that\u2019s it.  Having people respect your wedding as something super special after viewing you as married for years doesn\u2019t work.  Your mil shouldn\u2019t have done what she did, but trying to downplay your marriage isn\u2019t great.", "YTA. For a number of reasons. Expecting others to lie for you. Don\u2019t even try say it\u2019s not lying. You are getting married 3 YEARS before your wedding for legal reasons. So you will be lying to all your friends as well for 3 years. Why have a big wedding if you are totally ok with getting married in the court? \nYou are angry with your MIL for being happy and excited to have you officially be part of the family? Read that again. Some self reflection might be in order.", "NTA. Take this as a lesson learned about your MIL", "NTA but no way are you secretly married 3 years. That was doomed from the start. \nSounds like a power struggle from both of you.", "NTA but hopefully it'll give you time to consider the inadvisability of sanding a large chunk of money on a wedding. You'll regret it when you're wanting to retire but can't because you blew axwad on cake for other people.", "NTA.  She broke a promise to you both in about five minutes.\n\nUnless your mothers have partners you also expected them to keep the marriage knowledge from for years - that\u2019s not cool.\n\n\nBut why keep it a secret?  You\u2019ll already be married when you have your wedding, that\u2019s not anything you need to hide.\nIt\u2019s also a public record, and either of you would definitely tell more people sometime, so thinking nobody would know or find out over the next three years is silly.\n\nAre you worried that fewer people will come to your wedding reception with the three year gap?", "NTA. Makes no difference what the secret was\u2026 OP plainly stated her and fianc\u00e9 did not want anyone to know and FMIL agreed to this stipulation. Then immediately disregarded and broke agreement.", "NTA. I hate how so many people put the onus on the younger in-law (usually a woman) to play nice and maintain a relationship with their spouse's disrespectful parent. I was the kid in this dynamic and it was horrible. My mother groveling in front of my dad's nasty family in hopes of maintaining a relationship. There was no relationship. Just a couple of bullies being cruel to her and to us.\n\nOP, keep MIL on a short leash and make sure your spouse has the guts to take your side and shut her down or you'll be trampled. Spouses come before parents. If you aren't #1 in his life, don't marry him.", "NTA for being upset that she told people when you specifically asked her to keep it quiet, but what alternative do you have other than to suck it up and forgive her?  What are you gonna do, not marry him?  \n\nI think maybe forgive but do not ever forget \u2014 she is not to be trusted with private information in the future.  Want to keep a pregnancy/job change/move/etc a secret?  Don\u2019t tell her until you\u2019re ready for everyone to know.  Make sure future hubby is on board with this, because this has the potential to become a major landmine in your marriage.", "YTA for wanting to trick people into thinking you aren\u2019t married and pretend you are marrying in 2026 so you can have a party and get gifts.", "ESH You're blowing it out of proportion especially because it seems like she had no malicious intent.

Better to be on good terms w in laws.", "Lite YTA - Look, as someone who is currently secretly courthouse married, you went about this in entirely the wrong way. That's not a secret you ask mothers to hold, and definitely not for *three years.* Yeah, she shouldn't have gone and told everyone, but this was a thoroughly predictable and almost inevitable outcome.\n\nOur secret courthouse marriage had my wife's sorority sisters as witnesses, for comparison. Not parents, siblings, or even cousins. That's not a burden you should put on family, especially for that long. It's been nearly a year and our secret is still locked down.", "NTA\n\nthis happened to me and my NOW EX (still techinally married but i left him and his family 4 years ago) ..... we had a courthouse wedding cause i was with child back in 09 ..... we AGREED that we would not do anything till that summer with both sides of the family could travel (most of my extended family live down south while i live in the north east - so its a good 12 hours trip and it was the middle of winter with no real warning to my side of the family)my ENTIRE ex's side lives in the area low and behold as soon as we left the courthouse i got spirited over to a reception venue with his ENTIRE \\*insert swear word\\* FAMILY, and only 2 of my personal friends .....\n\ni fear for you and your future cause this act that his parents did left a lot of resentment to where eventually (not for this alone) but it just built up too much for me to handle with him) - not even the children could save our marriage at that point (and i still love my boys and give them a good life that wouldnt have been as good if i had stayed - honestly i was starting to get very ragey and i really feel if i had of stayed with that man i would not have been able to be a good mother to those boys)", "Uh ESH... fyi, you do not need to be married to put him onto your health insurance", "ESH. Obviously you have the right to be upset. But you asked your parents to keep something that is public record private for three years. I love my mom and know there\u2019s not a world where she would keep that a secret, I have a good feeling your husband knows his mom couldn\u2019t keep that a secret, especially for THREE YEARS and you still asked. Was it your idea to have your moms or a joint decision? The best thing to have done was to just come clean and have a blowout party when you could afford it.", "NTA.  But you need to be guarded moving forward. It's time to put MIL on an information diet until you feel like you can trust her again. Hopefully, your husband has your back on this. \n\nWeddings and babies bring out the worst in people. It's important to remember that moving forward. Be guarded with what you tell people, even your own family. Opinions are like AHs, and everyone is going to tell your theirs and get pushy. You have to have a no-nonsense attitude and a united front with your husband.", "NTA and now she needs to be on an info diet", "NTA. My mother did the same thing. We got married and needed a witness (it was during covid) and we were planning a big wedding when things let up. Well, half the family heard and just HAD to come. We winded up having to order delivery at our house to feed everyone after. Half the people gave money/gifts (nice but we didn't expect it) and we wound up never having the big wedding bc it felt wrong after half the guest list already celebrated technically.", "NTA. Now you know that you cannot trust her with anything you consider to be important. This is an early wedding gift. Have a discussion with your husband about this violation of trust and see what he thinks. Going forward, I think you need to be a more united front on things that you won\u2019t be telling her because she cannot be trusted to keep it to herself. If she complains later then I think you need to point out how she decided to breach your trust despite insisting she not tell because she placed her own feelings ahead of yours and your plainly stated request.  That while you could appreciate her excitement, she ruined your wedding for 2026 because she could not keep the agreement you made. So going forward the ability to trust her word is compromised. So until you feel she can actually keep a secret, you are not inclined to share any.", "NTA, but do they not allow domestic partners on your health plan? That's what I did.", "YTA lying is stupid. You got married. You didn\u2019t have the lavish reception you wanted. You can only afford it 3 years from now. You thought it would be a somehow more special reception if people didn\u2019t know about the courthouse. You don\u2019t even mention a religious ceremony, that is still affordable without a lavish reception. You are part of your husband\u2019s family now even though you pretend you\u2019re not.

Best to decide if you can handle it or can learn to brush it off.", "Be pissed and let her know it. But then let it go. \n\nAlso, she is now last to know ANY significant news regarding your lives. Pregnant? Even distant cousins know before she does. Baby is born? Absolute last phone call made. She made her bed.", "NTA she clearly can\u2019t keep secrets. Just realize when you tell her something everyone will know after. Act accordingly. Now the bigger issue is how your fianc\u00e9 acted.

Although, now you know she cannot keep a secret, so do not tell her things you don\u2019t want repeated.  But did you really expect to keep this a secret for three years?!  That makes you ta as well.  Have you looked into your insurance that you actually gave to be married to add your boyfriend?  Most insurances today do not require being married anymore.", "NTA. You don't have to give her your trust to give her your forgiveness. She has proven she doesn't deserve the trust.

She could be trying to sabotage you two.", "This might be a good time to learn about how and why to grey rock. As other folks have mentioned,  you and your SO would be well served by making sure you are presenting a united front and always staying on the same page regarding what you two share with MIL and what you will do as a team when she is disrespectful, intrusive, and overbearing.  Nail it all down now, before you even consider moving toward having kids, should you choose to do so.  Lock up your birth control,  get a security system, and never give anyone in his family a key to your home. This all sounds like a lot, but she has already betrayed your trust and dismissed your feelings about that. She's not going to be someone you can ever trust.  Don't depend on her for money, help, support, a ride, or honesty. \nCongratulations, by the way--I hope your future wedding is joyful!", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to be pissed at her and also forgive her.

If you just let it lie and side with her about being overexcited, it will expose you as being weak and forgiving.

Better late than never. No secrets involved.\n\nI know of another couple that did what you did and actually kept the secret for a year before the public ceremonial wedding. About 6 months after the big public wedding, the secret got out that they had actually married a year earlier. Half the relatives were pissed and felt betrayed. Not all and not me, but I would not count on no one being offended. \n\nAnd of course, as you found out, secrets are hard to keep.

For some people getting married or even divorced (i.e., medical debt for a terminal illness) actually is the better option. It sounds dramatic, but not all jobs offer healthcare and sometimes it's significantly cheaper to get on your spouse's plan than it is to get one in the market.\n\nI have a cousin who had to turn down a promotion at work because it would have placed her in a different tax bracket and eliminated her health care, and she wouldn't have been able to afford benefits at that level. That's the reality of the world we live in. :/\n\nI can't wait to afford health care again.", "For some people, marriage happens when a priest say it.
