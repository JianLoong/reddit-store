So much that this is actually one of those times that I can say I feel sorry for your kid and really mean it. Others have pointed out why consistency and showing up is important, in terms of high school football, but let me add something that jumps out the most to me. \n\nParenting is hard and only seeing your kids on a schedule makes it so much tougher. But how we react to that, how we handle ourselves when it comes to raising these kids in a not-ideal life situation, these are the things our kids remember. These are the things that cause them, as soon-to-be-adults, to see us for who we really are. And if what they see is something that hurts them or makes their lives harder well, don\u2019t be surprised if prolonged exposure to that kind of crap leads your kid to not answer your calls when he\u2019s grown and not stuck to a parenting schedule.", "YTA-  Summer practices are insanely important for the fall season.

It is not an exaggeration.\n\nI get it, my oldest was a 3-sport athlete + band. Holy fuck our summers were screwed.  And \"optional\" weight training in the summer is very much not optional. It is labeled optional due to state sports regulations, but kiddo will be punished for not being part of the team.\n\nTeens are expensive.  in $$ and time. This is only the beginning for a kid that is involved in his school.  I'd MUCH rather a kid be over-involved in school & school activities, than some of alternative. It gets better when they can drive themselves.  Auto insurance doubles, though, eek!\n\nIf you can't do it, you can't.  There will fallout from that decision.

If you refuse to, don\u2019t be surprised if your son decides he doesn\u2019t want to spend any time with you at all.

Every person on that team has stuff that could be used as an excuse but they manage to get their kid to practice. Allowing your son to play, much less start, would be incredibly unfair to the kids that are out there working hard for the team.

YTA.", "YTA if my mom made it so I couldn't do what I love to do like sports I would hate you... I even enjoy every single practice. Don't do this to your son. Think of it like I drive an hour to watch my son have a great time for a couple hours then on the way home we stop somewhere to eat or something. Literally not a hard sacrifice for your son... from the sounds of your comments like the one saying you eont let him join the team at all sounds like dad needs full custody. Step up and be an awesome mother this is your time to shine.", "What does your son want? If he want to participate and you're not letting him YTA. He is 14 and is close to a age where he can choose with which parent to stay with full time. Talk to your kid and consider what is best for him.", "YTA. \n\nIt's not just about the football. \n\nYou're treating your son like he's an object you and your ex are fighting over. But he's a separate person, with his own interests. And what you're saying is his interests, his dreams even, are not important to you. You don't care, because they're an inconvenience to you and besides you don't really want to. You're so intent on \"winning\" this point that you're prepared to withhold your consent, so he can't do the thing he loves. \n\nWhat a terrible message to send to your kid. Seriously. \n\nAnd it's not just about the here and now. I'm not a big fan of any football code, but even I can see that it helps kids learn some valuable life skills about organisation, time management, goal-setting and team work. Love the sport or not, those are skills that are really useful in education and work. Why would you not want to foster those skills in your 14 year old?", "YTA \n\nPlease push this so his Dad can get full custody.", "YTA. Your son should be your priority. Don\u2019t have kids if you can\u2019t take care of them. Missing half the practices means a) your son can\u2019t do something he loves because mom can\u2019t get her act together and b) that he can\u2019t participate in the football games. He will not have the same advantage as the kids playing football. Your son is part of a team and instead of teaching him about teamwork and commitment, you are teaching him the opposite. I see why your son wants to live with his father. One of your son\u2019s parents listens to him. It should be you, but it\u2019s not. You are awful and your son will go no contact as soon as he can. Do better.", "If you want your son to resent you further and sever contact as soon as he\u2019s able, then, by all means, continue down this path. YTA.", "Sorry, YTA. I know it sucks to hear but it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about your son.", "YTA newsflash - his dad isn\u2019t brain washing him, he\u2019s just old enough to notice how selfish you are", "YTA Your husband seems to be the only one looking out for your kids. Between letting him hang out with him toting drug taking kids in the park and keeping him from his team sport, you don\u2019t seem to care about your sons well being at all", "YTA 6 months ago you posted that your son was friends with kids who were doing drugs, posting pictures with guns, getting into fights, and your son was also getting into fights. Given timelines, I'm going to guess *that* is why you lost custody, and your son is not \"brainwashed\" but finally has structure and discipline in his life. By refusing to ensure he makes it to practice, you are depriving him of his structure and his outlet, and will drive him back into those prior behaviors. Grow up and start putting your son's welfare first.", "I would say YTA but the gas money is a real struggle. If I were you I\u2019d help find him a carpool ride or something.

My own son played football when he was younger. He started with flag football and worked his way to tackle. At first, his dad would take him to games or practices, but eventually, he stopped, so my son was missing practices and some games. This wasn't fair to the coaches or the rest of the team, so after the last year, around 4th or 5th grade, I told him we couldn't sign him up anymore. He said he understood, and still as an adult agrees with the reasoning, but he's angry he wasn't able to continue playing because his dad chose to be that kind of parent. Think about what you're doing to the relationship you still have with your son, and think about the kind of relationship you want to have when he's older.", "Total AH, is it you want your son there as your son or to help with the younger siblings.", "YTA. Your approach is very short sighted and selfish.  Refusing to support your child's passions like this isn't going to encourage him to want to spend any time with you and it will make your exs life far easier if he decides to seek full custody.", "YTA. Missing practice over the summer will get him cut from the team. Stop being so selfish and drive him. Better yet, just let him stay with his father. You failed to mention the fact that you were totally fine with your kid hanging out with a very unsavory crowd (guns, drugs, etc) despite your ex\u2019s objections when he was with you. Or the multiple school suspensions and expulsion. No wonder your ex is pushing for custody for both kids!", "Brooooooooo \"partially because he kept complaining to the judge about not wanting to live with\" why not mention the guns and drugs? Maybe that had something to do with dad getting custody?", "YTA. Your son wants to play football and practices are part of the obligation. You should want to support him. If you don\u2019t, you will eventually never get to see him because of your selfishness.", "YTA. He cannot miss half the practices. It would be unsafe for conditioning and for play as he won\u2019t know the plays. He probably would be asked to quit the team", "YTA, THIS would have been your chance to bond with him and to be seen as a parent who tries , now all he\u2019ll remember is how dad made the effort to foster his passions and you didn\u2019t", "YTA. Just because you explain the circumstances to the coaches, doesn\u2019t mean they have to accommodate his schedule. I doubt the consequences would be intentional or malicious, but it literally wouldn\u2019t be fair to reward your son a place on the team when he came to half as many practices as the other kids. Coaches aren\u2019t going to upset other kids and parents because you don\u2019t want to compromise with your ex. \n\nIf your son is already \u201cbrainwashed,\u201d further alienating him by not putting effort into helping him with his hobbies and passions isn\u2019t going to help. \n\nYou\u2019re really focusing a lot on what you want (quality time) with your son, but don\u2019t seem to be focusing on his wants (which is probably why he chooses to live with dad). Showing him that you care enough to sacrifice for him makes you look a lot less selfish and vindictive, which he will hopefully appreciate more than quality time with you.", "Even if it\u2019s just summer conditioning/pre season?", "He is because he hated his dad for leaving us for the longest time and we were very close, but then suddenly after living with his dad during covid he suddenly wanted to live with him.", "I dont even have to agree though, to football.

She sounds like a very lazy parent.", "Lol what?\n\nHow *dare* the ex-husband facilitate their son doing something he loves? /s\n\nPlotting revenge? For what? The ex-husband is not the problem here.", "Yes, that\u2018s the time when coaches decide who\u2018s in team, who\u2018s skilled enough for special tactics, who is great in combination with whom. And oh, who is unreliable and will sit on the bench with no playing time in games.", "When do you think they prepare for the season?  During preseason.  Those practices are not optional.  The kids who make every practice will be awarded the playing time.  High school sports isn\u2019t pee wee where everyone gets a chance to play.

You are punishing your son to get back at your ex.", "Yes they will see he is not committed. And quite frankly you be painting yourself as a uncaring mother.", "Yes he will, my high school coach was very clear in that point.", "yeah that's how the season works, coach's want to know who's committed to the team and will make them look good, and a player who shows up to only half the summer practices won't be looked on too fondly.\n\nI get you want to spend time with him, but what you're doing is pushing him away.", "Yes, this is when the coaches see who is committed to training, not just playing.  This is when skills are developed.", "Especially if it\u2019s just summer- that\u2019s when coaches make decisions and judge how dedicated kids are. That\u2019s when they get to know their team and figure out who works well together- practice during the school year is basically maintenance, while practice in the pre season is where the team building happens.

Summer preseason play/conditioning is THE MOST CRITICAL OFF SEASON TIME FULL STOP. That is where you prepare for the grueling season, meet with other players and possibly coaching staff.
