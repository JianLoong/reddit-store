But how we react to that, how we handle ourselves when it comes to raising these kids in a not-ideal life situation, these are the things our kids remember. These are the things that cause them, as soon-to-be-adults, to see us for who we really are.

But he's a separate person, with his own interests. And what you're saying is his interests, his dreams even, are not important to you. You don't care, because they're an inconvenience to you and besides you don't really want to. You're so intent on \"winning\" this point that you're prepared to withhold your consent, so he can't do the thing he loves. \n\nWhat a terrible message to send to your kid. Seriously. \n\nAnd it's not just about the here and now. I'm not a big fan of any football code, but even I can see that it helps kids learn some valuable life skills about organisation, time management, goal-setting and team work.

He will not have the same advantage as the kids playing football. Your son is part of a team and instead of teaching him about teamwork and commitment, you are teaching him the opposite. I see why your son wants to live with his father. One of your son\u2019s parents listens to him. It should be you, but it\u2019s not. You are awful and your son will go no contact as soon as he can.

Given timelines, I'm going to guess *that* is why you lost custody, and your son is not \"brainwashed\" but finally has structure and discipline in his life. By refusing to ensure he makes it to practice, you are depriving him of his structure and his outlet, and will drive him back into those prior behaviors. Grow up and start putting your son's welfare first.", "I would say YTA but the gas money is a real struggle. If I were you I\u2019d help find him a carpool ride or something.

Just because you explain the circumstances to the coaches, doesn\u2019t mean they have to accommodate his schedule. I doubt the consequences would be intentional or malicious, but it literally wouldn\u2019t be fair to reward your son a place on the team when he came to half as many practices as the other kids.

Get over yourself and help your son get to practice.", "Reading your other post you are really a shity parent letting your kid be friends with kids that play with gins and have weed and vale AT 14", "Question:\n\nDo you want a relationship with your son when he grows up?\n\n\nBecause I'm guessing you do. And the way to get that is to not force him to spend time with you now. I know it hurts to see him as little as you do, but forcing him to spend time with you when he'd rather be playing football with possible consequences of not getting selected to the team is not going to make him like you. It's going to make him resent you. The resentment can very well turn into going NC with you when he turns 18. So for the sake of you future relationship with him, let him go to football. If you can't drive him there and back again 4 days a week, let him sleep 3 nights at his dads. \n\nYou can have a conversation with him and his dad about how this makes you feel and that you'd like to get some extra time later in the year to spend with your son to make up for the time you are losing out on now. Maybe you can get Christmas to spend with him or something like that.", "So you got one baby I\u2019m guessing from your new partner, a 7 year old and then a 14 year old who lives with his dad. You work one day a week and have a bf also supporting you.\n\nHmm. You have made some really poor choices huh.", "ESH.  \n\nYTA for dismissing the need to attend football practices. If you don't practice,  you don't play.   If your argument was you felt it was unsafe (CTE) for example,  or his grades were suffering and he needed to attend summer school,  or that you simply cannot afford to take him to practices and your ex refused to help you afford it,  then I'd say NTA.  Those decisions have nothing to do with being mad at his father.  Those are welfare of your child issues. \n\nHowever,  you spewed way too many words about how you are the victim,  people are against you,  Dad is programming everyone, and life isn't fair.  You may be the victim.  People may be against you because they don't know the whole story.  And life isn't fair.  But, those big feelings are yours to deal with.  You don't get to have those big feelings impact your son.  He has his own big feelings. And I suspect you aren't present to help him process them.  So for that, YTA. \n\nThe ESH is that if you truly can't afford to get him to practice half the time,  and your ex won't help with that expense,  he's an asshole, too.  Otherwise, it's just YTA.", "YTA. My son is in first grade and devoted to soccer, so I hauled myself (as a stay at home mom) and my toddler to every single game and practice because it\u2019s important to my kid. On my off day, I took my toddler to her music classes. I have extreme anxiety, but I still showed up day in and day out because it\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about my kids. If your ex is paying gas money, you have zero excuses", "In her previous post (when she had custody) she whines about her ex wanting her son to be better supervised while she wants to be more hands off. Her son had just been suspended for getting into fights and posting a picture of himself with a gun magazine and threatening the school. Still, she thinks her way is best. The son is in no way brainwashed. He just spent a decent amount of time with the stable parent.", "What? No we split ages ago, my son just up and went to live with his dad and changed schools 6 months ago.", "Uh what poor choices have i made exactly?", "You can't stop your son from playing football.  Your ex may not be able to make you pay half of the fees or have you take him to practices, etc. No court will side with you on this, especially given your reasoning.  Besides, you claim to want to spend more time with your son? What better opportunity during the hour commute.

Kid wants to spend time with their friends more than they want to spend time with their mom who already has her hands full.\n\nWhat does the kid do when he is at OP's house anyway ? Slave-obligated baby sitting for the 7 years old ? I bet that after the next baby is born , mommy is gonna \"gently ask\" the 14 years old to step up. 14 years old deserve to be happy away from any obligation that an adult should uphold. He deserves to have real summer memories made by his own hands.\n\nKeep away the kid from doing what he loves and he will keep you away the moment he reaches 18.", "Ah, so your sons are trophies and you are a trophy mom, not a real parent...

Your ex left you, not the kids - make the distinction and move on.\n2. Your older son was going down a bad path living with you.\n3. Since living with your ex he is now a good student and athlete.\n4. He has goals to achieve regarding his football and he needs to commit to practice like most athletes do.\n5. Your ex is prepared to support these goals and you are not supportive at all.\n\nSo you now have a choice- you can get onboard and co parent which will give you an ongoing relationship with your son. Otherwise it will probably go back to court and you will lose. If I were you I would add up the days you are entitled to over the summer and ask your ex to have them allocated around the practice. That way you get your agreed days at a different time but no one misses out on football etc.\nIn summary as things stand yta but you could easily change this by putting your sons needs first and working out an acceptable compromise with your ex.", "From OP comments I don't think she gets it. For her this is about her, her efforts and her winning against her ex when in reality this is all about her kid and his needs. If you don't want to make sacrifices don't have kids. \nI assure you your kid will never forget and may not forgive your choice, you may try to justify it, but the choice you are making if you follow through, is for you convenience and not for the sake of your kid.", "Son's opinion on where to live probably had less impact on the decision than the son having been expelled 6months ago for some serious issues (per OPs other post) and dad's decision to push football could be to get the son disciplined and invested in doing well at school, since you often can't play if your grades suck or you misbehave and you don't attend classes. Given all the other details in OPs other post I can't fathom why she doesn't want to have her son in something like this, and away from negative influences, and isn't pulling out all the stops to get him there!", "I doubt you have to drive an hour to 1.5 hours though each way", "Girl that is the most important time for them.

Dad was watching the kids posts because he and his friends were posting photos with guns and drugs so he filed for a modification of custody cause mommy dearest here didn\u2019t want him to lose his friends despite getting expelled from school.
