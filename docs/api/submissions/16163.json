{"id": 16163, "submission_id": "134ylau", "title": "AITA for having a night off from visiting may boyfriend in hospital?", "selftext": "On Tuesday (25/04/2023) my (F28) boyfriend (M29) had an accident at work. He has a broken foot and leg. His boss called me at 4pm and I went straight to the hospital. I stayed by his side until midnight when he was going to sleep (and made a trip to our flat and back during that time to bring him an overnight bag).\n\nWednesday morning, he had surgery at 8am. I called the hospital for an update and they said I could visit from 2-8pm (regular visiting hours). I told work what happened and went up there that afternoon. I stayed with him for about 4 hours. This day was probably the hardest so far. He was in an awful mood (understandably - as he was in a lot of pain and probably feeling very angry at the situation - I am not ignoring that) - but he kept acting as if I couldn't do anything right. I cried all the way home this night.\n\nI visited Thursday evening (similar to Wednesday in the sense that I wasn't doing anything right - bought him a burger and he complained about where I got it from) plus I brought up extra things from our flat that he asked for as he was told this day that he would have to stay in 7-10 days for another operation. Friday evening (his friend was there, too this time which was easier as we all chatted as a group which kept the mood light). On Saturday my brother and his fianc\u00e9 visited. We played games together, my partner was talkative and seemed a lot more energetic and like his 'normal' self. This was the first time we had a proper cuddle and that he asked me how I was doing. Sunday, his mum visited for the first time and I joined them.\n\nToday is Monday (a bank holiday in the UK). Yesterday he said that he appreciated me going up and that I didn't have to - he wanted me to live my life. So I said that I might have today off. This morning, he said that his grandparents would be visiting in the afternoon, so I make some plans by myself to have a relaxing afternoon, to hopefully feel recharged for tomorrow. At 4.30pm I get a text asking what time I'm coming up, and if I can bring him a burger. I explained that I thought we agreed for me to have the day off, but that I can bring him a burger if he really wants one - he responds with \"up to you, I would love a burger but if you've got plans then don't worry\". I found it really hard not to just agree to do it, but going via the burger place is nearly an hour walk and I want to unwind for the day, I respond exactly this and that I want to start making my dinner, but that I will visit him tomorrow and bring one. Then I get the messages: \"Right, don't know how to respond to that, see you later. Don't worry about coming up tomorrow\". I try calling him, he blocks my call and I get \"No need to call, not much to say . Too late now so enjoy your evening.\"\n\nAm I the asshole? I thought we had agreed both verbally and via text that I should have a night or 2 off. Both family, friends and a colleague have been checking in with me and reminding me that I need to look after myself too, and this is all I was trying to do.", "created_utc": 1682968893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134ylau/aita_for_having_a_night_off_from_visiting_may/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He agreed that you should get one night free from visiting him then changed his mind and is acting emotionally abusive in response.

Can\u2019t his grandparents bring him a burger?

There is no excuse for his terrible behavior: not the frustration of being in the hospital, not the pain, and not a reaction to the medication. He\u2019s being an abusive, manipulative AH and none of that is your fault. I really hope this is a wake up call and you decide to take your amazing, wonderful, caring self away from him. I promise there are wonderful people who will cherish you.", "NTA\n\nThe grandparents should bring him the burger.", "NTA. Keep in mind he is on pain meds so maybe isn't being himself.

Don't know your BF but if he normally acts this way when he doesn't get his way, then, oh well.  If not, perhaps it is the result of his meds and pain.  Hopefully he will reconsider his childish behavior soon.

Good luck!", "NTA\n\nI get that he\u2019s in pain but this is passive aggressive behaviour. He set up a test you were guaranteed to fail.\n\nIf this is new behaviour, give him some time and see if he apologises.

NTA. I suggest you visit on Tuesday as you had planned and bring him the burger. Once he's out of the hospital, though, is worth it to communicate to him how ornery he's being to you and how it made you feel.", "Ugh.

If he talked to me like that\u2026bye bye!", "Info - Is he on painkillers that could be causing confusion?  He knew you were going to take a day off from visiting, then pretended he didn't, then blocked you?\n\nHis behavior is bizarre - your confusion suggests that he doesn't normally act erratic.", "Nta break up with him", "NAH. Pain medication is a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it really takes the edge off, a curse because it really messes with your head. You're not yourself during that time.\n\nYour friends and family are right. You have to look after yourself as well. This can mean a night or two off. The hospital, even if short-staffed, is there to tend to your BF's core medical needs.", "[deleted]", "NAH he's in a tough spot with pain medication and heightened emotions and his reaction is not reflective of you doing something wrong. He forgot you weren't coming and he's also probably feeling a little pouty and selfish because he's injured and everyone is treating him with kid gloves. Makes sense that he would act a little bit childish. As long as he can later acknowledge it and give you the appreciation that you deserve for doing all you are doing then fine. Just find time for yourself to relax, this is emotional for you too and you need to take care of yourself through this time as well.", "He was obviously only saying 'you don't *have* to visit' to be polite and considerate. But OF COURSE he actually WANTED you to come. And I bet he's very sad and perhaps angry that you didn't want to. Fucksake it's only been a couple of days, not months and months. Did you really not want to visit? Did you really have anything more important to do? Poor guy is stuck there and you can't be arsed to pop in for an hour on your day off? Just how fragile are you if you have to \"look after yourself\" so hard that you can't spare an hour? \n\nYTA\n\nHe's lying there re-evaluating this relationship.", "NTA.\nI don't think this incident is worthy of calling you an AH, but I do think it's insensitive.\n\nHe's hurting, he's probably angry at the situation, plus I'm sure he's on painkillers. If he's usually a good man, then this is just a bump in the road and he will eventually be fine. Try to be more considerate.\n\nI got a severe infection that put me in the hospital. I know it's boring to visit, but my partner made sure to come every single day to make me feel loved. I would do the same for him. It's what partners do. \n\nJust a little time out of your day could brighten his entire day.", "ESH. \n\nHe clearly wanted you to visit him everyday but did not communicate it adequately. He's also been (understandably?) terrible the entire time he's been in hospital.  That's on him. \n\nBut if my partner was laid up in the hospital for days on end, you couldn't keep me from visiting everyday. This is the bare minimum.", "NTA. Is this out of character for him?", "NTA You did nothing wrong. He doesn't need you visiting you every day. You have work and chores to do. He is bored and throws himself a pity party. Don\u2019t forget yourself over this. \n\nLike i'm nearly every year in the hospital. And my SO mostly doesn't even need to visit or bring or puck me up, even if i have surgeries. He must work much, cares for our pets and the way to the hospitals are always long with public transport. And you can occupy yourself good with todays electronics. It isn\u2019t 1980 and you can just read or do crosswords.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is being emotionally manipulative. This isn't acceptable behaviour. His injury is no excuse.", "He is still on painkillers yes. I think this is how I made the mistake with the burger as I could have sworn I went to the place that he asked me to but he disagrees. Will take this into consideration, thanks!", "SHE should be re-evaluating their relationship.", "I think you misread.\n\n>going via the burger place is nearly an hour walk\n\nIt takes her an hour to GET the burger and get to the hospital. Then she has to visit him. Then presumably it takes her another hour to get home. So what is \"just a burger\" for him is a half a day for her.\n\nI hope he does reevaluate the relationship because he is trearing her terribly. He has other people visiting him. She doesn't need to be there every freaking day. Someone else can bring him a burger, or he can DoorDash it.\n\nHe's being passive-aggressive and mean.", "It's not a little time though. She has to walk an hour to get there.", "She can't be expected to be a mind reader. If he didn't communicate his needs, that's on him. Needing a day of doesn't make someone an asshole, especially because her bf offered it and he has plenty of other people coming to visit him.", "Is this out of character for him?", "why?", "The burger is not an essential component of the visit. The burger part is,I agree, a bit needy and silly and demanding, even if he is feeling sad and needing some comfort food. \n\nEven so, when my loved ones are in hospital I make damn sure I visit once a day.", "I would just like to add that I do feel AWFUL for not visiting after his reaction.", ">The burger is not an essential component of the visit.\n\nI think the boyfriend would disagree. He has already been passive aggressive and mean to her about getting the \"wrong\" burger. He's taught her that she dare not show up without his preferred burger, which takes her an hour of walking (!!) to get, which is why she needs a day off.", "Hell no gurl, he wants you to feel awful and that\u2019s gross. You agreed on a day off and you take it!", "Good. So tell him that. \n\n\n\nI was in hospital for about that long and my partner came every day at least once. She was in hospital for a week and I did the same. When your partner is in hospital they become your number one priority: I could NOT have enjoyed myself knowing she was there alone. Now if he'd been in hospital for weeks or months, sure, \"carer fatigue\" is a very real thing and you'd need a night off. But this has only been a few days. Hence my vote.\n\nBTW I also second whoever said painkillers can mess with your head.", "Hmm. I see your point", "Did you treat her like crap making her feel nothing she did was good enough? No? Then not the same! Dude needs an attitude adjustment while he\u2019s there. \n\nOp NTA.", "> Did you treat her like crap making her feel nothing she did was good enough? \n\nThe burger thing was ridiculous, I admit.", "For me it\u2019s the agreeing to her not coming that day, and then changing his mind and demanding a burger from a specific place. \n\nI\u2019ll move heaven and earth for my partner but if he treated me like this for a burger I would let him sweat out for a few days.", "Fair enough\n\nAlthough god knows, when I am sick I am pathetic and needy and annoying.", "When I am sick I want to be pathetic and needy and annoying, but I choose not to be that way because it's a mean way to behave. Try to be better.", "I think it\u2019s genetics. Most men tend to be : )", "NTA  He's being a jerk.", "Nta, he's actually being really selfish. He's taking his frustration out on you and you've been his whole support. You're there everyday and his friends and family have only visited  him briefly. Give him a day or 2 and he'll either realize how much you're doing or you'll realize how little he appreciates you.", "NTA. He knows it himself.", "NTA. Caregiver fatigue is real, and you can\u2019t take care of anyone else unless you take care of yourself. It\u2019s not selfish, it\u2019s necessary. \n[my mom ended up in ER/overnight admission, they wheeled her from her husband\u2019s upstairs room after she passed out, from exhaustion and migraine after taking care of him for weeks/months.]", "Before he went into the hospital, were you two happy? If this is the first he's acted like this, you need to have a direct conversation about: 1. Whether he feels mentally well (the combo of being in the hospital and going under anaesthesia can have deleterious effects) and if he does feel well, 2. His passive-aggressive behavior. No one should have to deal with this. Be caring and concerned, but don't shy away from asking him why he's treating you terribly.", "NTA, you took one day off to care for yourself, your bf can use uber eats or something", "NTA. He is being one. Take care of yourself.", "NTA, he may not remember what he told you due to pain meds. They cause time to go slowly.", "Being in the hospital, drugged up and in pain is not a present experience, but, he\u2019s taking it out on you and being an ungrateful asshole.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you what to do here, but his behavior is rubbish.", "Yep. My husband was in three nights last week. It seemed sooo much longer than that. \n\nOP -- NTA. Take the time for yourself. The burden isn't going to be any easier once he gets released especially with his attitude.", "Um sounds like yall need a 7-10 day break if he can't even be grateful you're going out of the way for him everyday. Yta for letting him treat you like crap everytime you visit alone & not calling him out for it. I could understand being in pain & in the hospital, but you say he acts differently when his friends & family are there."]}
