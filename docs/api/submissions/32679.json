That poor woman deserves better", "Would it be so bad if she spent less time with her dad and more with her mom?", "Seriously!!! Lol, the post is too vanilla for my liking, maybe the mother has problems, maybe stepdaughter is being abused, we wouldn\u2019t know and stepmom wouldn\u2019t tell us anyway, but I did notice she only said something \u201cAFTER marriage\u201c", "Because after a certain age court orders are pointless regarding custody.\n\nHere it is 14. My children do not follow the court order because they are 14 and 17. There is no way to enforce it once they reach a certain age.", "Yes, better pull the plug just to be on the safe side.", "You\u2019re being sarcastic, right?", "> He literally started crying once when she stayed with her mom for a week because \"he missed her so much\".\n\nWas his daughter witness to this? It's normal to be sad about your child being gone but if he did this in front of daughter or told her about it it's not healthy.", "Yes, it's their choice and they've made it.  Time for you to accept that.", "Calling B.S. on this. If it's true, you should not remove his daughter from him. She was there first you are JUST the second wife.", "Do you think your husband is purposely alienating his daughter from her mother?", "So you are indeed jealous of there relationship", "What's wrong with missing your child? What's wrong with being sad? And why do joj think that has anything to do with the situation with the mom?", "Her mom isn\u2019t eliminated from her life. She just doesn\u2019t see her as often as she used to. She\u2019s old enough to make that choice. You\u2019re being disingenuous. You don\u2019t care about her relationship with her mother. If you did, you would be suggesting family therapy or some other method to help repair the relationship. Instead you\u2019re asking for your stepdaughter to spend half her time at her mother\u2019s house even though you know she doesn\u2019t want to be there.", "That's not how it works. Generally, when a child gets to a certain age the judge will let them choose. My grand daughter had a dad who was verbally abusive and he lost his 50/50 with her. You aren't concerned with the other mother, you are being selfish yourself.", "I offer my YTA opinion as someone who raised a child as a single mom.  By his choice, my child's father had minimal custodial time.  He was a responsible parent when our child was with him, took good care and I encouraged the relationship,  such as it was.  By the time our child was 16, they were active in school activities,  sports, and socially.   Overnights discontinued and they chose when and how often they spent time with their father.   It sounds to me like your husband and daughter have a similar situation,  just in reverse.  \n\nThe arrangement has been working for all involved.   Stop trying to interfere.   Just stop.", "This isn't your call to make.", "OP have you asked her why she wants to spend most of her time at Dad's?", "YTA. Her relationship with her mom isn't your business.", "Keep that attitude and I can guess how\u2019s gonna be out of their lives next.", "Like you care about her mom. Whom are you trying to fool. YTA>", "She\u2019s 16 ffs. At this point, a judge would listen to her better than you are. \n\nThis isn\u2019t your business. No, you being the stepmom and living there doesn\u2019t make it your business. She\u2019s not your kid. Stop talking.", "Why not?", " Again. I ask WHY your stepdaughter has chosen her father as her primary parent?", "lol that\u2019s not how it works. When I was 12 and living in NY, the judge asked me who I wanted to live with and if I wanted visitation with the other parent. I stayed with my mom and said no to visitation with my dad. I still wanted to see him but on my terms around my school and sports schedule, not whenever the attorneys and judge said so. Worked great. \n\nIf the agreement says 50/50 but it\u2019s functionally more like 90/10 then it\u2019s because your stepdaughter(who is almost an adult), your husband and his ex wife have agreed to it. \n\nLet\u2019s be real, you don\u2019t like her and think she difficult so you want her gone more so you can spend time with your hubby. Boo hoo, shouldn\u2019t have married someone with a child then.", "[removed]", "She still sees her mom. This isn't your decision This is between her mother and father. Her mother could fight for more time if she wanted. Maybe there is a reason she wants less time with her mom. She is old enough to make that decision. Courts pay attention to to what the child wants after a certain age. How is this going to improve things if you try to interfere?", "It shouldn't all be put on you and your husband. If she's that difficult I understand wanting her to spend her court ordered time with her mother.", "No parent is owed a relationship with their child. There\u2019s a reason she doesn\u2019t want to be with her mom.", "First, she should be allowed to eliminate her mom if she is abusing or neglecting her. Since you won't share any details of why the daughter won't see her mom, this may be the case. Second, she isn't eliminated, she just isn't seeing her as much as her dad.", "If she wanted her with her she would enforce the custody. She's not. You want this, not her. You married a guy with a kid (that's not a part time job).", "YTA. Stop pretending that you care about his ex-wife. You just want the stepdaughter gone more.", "YTA. And we don\u2019t believe you. \n\nYou don\u2019t give two shits about \u201cthat poor woman\u201d or the kid. You just don\u2019t want this \u201cdifficult\u201d child around. Frankly, you\u2019re the one being difficult. \n\nThere are likely reasons the kid doesn\u2019t want to be there. Hell, it\u2019s probably why she\u2019s \u201cdifficult.\u201d\n\nAnd you shouldn\u2019t have married someone with a child if you weren\u2019t prepared for them to be there all the time. That\u2019s how parenting works, and he\u2019s a parent. \n\nGrow the fuck up.", "How well do you know the mother? So women are not at all maternal.  Maybe they hate each other? Don\u2019t put your emotions on them.  Plus the kid is 16 and she is old enough to know where she wants to live.  Plus you don\u2019t say anything about the mother contacting the your husband to demand they stick to the agreement.", "Again with the \"poor woman\" lie. Nobody believes you. YTA.", "You are a very blatant liar!", "If she\u2019s 16 and doesn\u2019t spend as much time with her mom it clearly bc that\u2019s what she wants, if her mother has any issues with it she can talk to your husband about it", "Maybe mom doesn\u2019t want her more.", "\"Poor woman\"? Lol.", "No, you just want time without your husband's kid around.", "Yta. Maybe stuff goes on behind closed doors. I\u2019d kill to have a dad that was that invested in me. Don\u2019t be that evil step parent.", "Yeah you don\u2019t give a shit about your stepdaughter or the mom! You don\u2019t know the relationship between the two! So keep your mouth shut! YTA OP", "Yet, the 'poor woman' you're trying to say you feel so compassionate about has clearly not done anything to enforce the custody agreement.  That tells me a lot. \n\nAlso, stop with the lie. You just want the daughter gone, you don't care about her mom's feelings.", "This is what is called hiding a bad motive under a good one.", "If her mom wants to see her more, she can arrange it with her 16 year old daughter. You are using the poor mom thing as a shield because the kid is always there and ruining your vibe.", "If it's what she wanted, not you.", "She old enough to decide who she wants to spend time with.", "So you lied when you said \"poor mom.\" You just want to get rid of her so YTA. Also, didn't this post appear a few weeks ago?", "Why don't you accompany her? Whenever you want her to give her mom some attention, you should go first. She will follow your example.\n\nIt will be a fun, bonding exercise for the both of you too.", "Yes, it would be bad of you to start limiting time between a parent and child. You knew the situation before you chose to marry into it. If you didn't want this dynamic, you shouldn't have chosen it.", "Quite possibly yes", "YTA because if you knew this was the situation why did you marry him? Has something changed? I would completely stay out of the custody and visitation stuff. None of your business. What you should do though is tell your husband you need some bonding time with him. Out to dinner here and there. Maybe an overnight trip. Couples do need some alone time whether they admit it or not.", "It would be very bad if it was not a healthy environment for her to be in. There could be more to this than you know. There is a reason she doesn\u2019t want to go there. If you continue to push this and make her feel unwelcome, who do you think your husband will side with? When you marry someone with children, even shared custody, there is always the chance that they will come to live with you full time. You need to either make peace with this or move on. If you don\u2019t, the decision will be made for you.", "You're a worthless step-parent. You should've never married someone with kids.", "This right here is exactly why no one with any sense wants to date single parents. The kid is supposed to grow up and eventually have their own life while your spouse is supposed to be your partner for the rest of your life. I guess once you've blown through one marriage like a finger through some one ply gas station toilet paper, all of that goes out of the window. \n\nObviously, the dad can't turn away the kid when she wants to stay at his house. That would be like abandoning her. But if his wife has concerns about what is going on, they need to talk about it civilly. If the kid is \"difficult,\" then maybe she needs therapy or the dad needs to be a parent and stop letting her treat his wife like shit.", "The judge will take into consideration the child\u2019s preferences, but generally won\u2019t cut the other parent out unless there\u2019s a very good reason to.  It\u2019s not generally as cut and dry as \u201cthe kid gets to decide what they want.\u201d  In most cases I feel the parents just feel so much guilt about the divorce and being strong/ firm parents it\u2019s just easier to let the kid have their way/ try to be the good guy.\n\nKids deserve to feel safe and secure and be raised in a nurturing home, but they don\u2019t have the maturity always to know what\u2019s best for them.\n\nGiven his choice, I know my son would live with his dad, because he doesn\u2019t have any chores when there, has no consequences for poor choices, has no expectations of a minimum level of academic performance.  I love my son and feel strongly it\u2019s my job to prepare him to be a self-sufficient adult and member of society, so if he speeds and operates the car unsafely, he loses car privileges for some time.  If he is failing multiple subjects, his curfew is reigned in until he corrects it.  If he\u2019s being an entitled punk, I pull the cell phone and other privileges.  (These things don\u2019t happen often, he has learned what\u2019s expected\u2026but that means living here is not Disneyland.)  \n\nDad also loves him but doesn\u2019t hold him accountable for anything, so of course it would be more \u201cfun\u201d and preferable to live with dad.  \n\nBut you know who my son is most likely to confide in when he fucks up or needs help?  He knows he can trust me to love him, help him, and keep it real, (even if there\u2019s consequences for poor choices) versus just sugar coating and telling him he\u2019s wonderful ALL the time.  (He IS wonderful, but like me, and all of us, he\u2019s human and makes mistakes and needs guidance and to learn from mistakes to grow\u2026he doesn\u2019t get as much of that from his dad.)", "> If the agreement says 50/50 but it\u2019s functionally more like 90/10 then it\u2019s because your stepdaughter(who is almost an adult), your husband and his ex wife have agreed to it.\n\nexactly.

It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.", "When I was a kid, the custody hearing went really quick. I was 15, the judge took me aside, asked which parent I wanted to live with. I said \"Mom\" He said Okay, And do you want your dad to have visitation? I said \"No\".\n\nAnd that was that.
