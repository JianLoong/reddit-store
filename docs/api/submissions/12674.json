When they got together even they used to joke about how different they were, my sister says that \"opposites do attract\" when referring to her relationship. \n\nThey met though some common friends and they hitted it off. But they have completely different points of views in almost everything, they don't have any shared hobbies, they don't even like the same kind of movies. For example, my sister is very athletic, she loves sports and when she was in school she won several awards due to her dedication. Her husband on the other hand hates sports. For what he told me he always faked to be sick to avoid PE (I can relate to that lol), his hobbies are more into the creative side. He likes to draw and does it very good, for example. \n\nI can say that my BIL and I have lots of stuff in common and I love to talk with him about our hobbies when we visit each other. I love drawing too and I actually work as an animator. I also love to watch movies/ series and criticize them, he does as well. My sister likes movies, but she'll rather watch a superheros movie (she's a marvel fan) or some comedy than a drama.\n\nAt this point it had been some time since I saw both my parents and my sister/ her husband as I live in a different state so I was trying to catch up with each of them. We were all chatting. We then started talking about the Oscars (I don't even know how the conversation took that turn), my BIL asked me if I had seen \"The whale\", I was like \"you're kidding? Course I saw it!\" And we started talking about it. Then he said that he had tried to get my sister to watch the movie with him but she said it was boring and left after 15 minutes. So I said \"welp, you married the wrong sister!\" And he said \"yeah, i guess so\" My parents, him and I laughed but we stopped laughing when we realized my sister wasn't laughing too. She was just looking disoriented i guess? And suddenly she started crying. She excused and said she was going to the bathroom, my mom went with her. \n\nWe were very worried and weirded out too, so the three of us also went to check on her shortly after. When she came out the bathroom she said that what we (BIL and I) did was very insensitive and made her feel like she wasn't enough for him. We said that's not what we intended and that we just wanted to joke around as we usually do, we didn't meant to hurt her. \n\nShe's better now but still seems a bit upset, specially to me. I tried making small talk but she just brushes me off. My mom told me that since she's pregnant she may have gotten over emotionally because of the hormones. She also said it's best to give her some space and to not do jokes like that anymore. Both my mom and my sister are making me feel like I am an asshole", "created_utc": 1679234392, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vm616/aita_for_joking_with_my_bil_that_he_married_the/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should definitely apologize to her and tell them both that it was out of line and stupid of you to make that \u201cjoke\u201d.", "YTA. Unless you have feelings for your BIL and want everyone to know it, that was a really outlandish comment. You owe your sister an enormous apology. Her being pregnant has absolutely nothing to do with her reaction to your really weird and rude comment.", "Your sister's reaction to this \"offhand comment\" makes me think something deeper is going on here and perhaps this wasn't the first time it's been alluded to that you and your BIL would have been a better fit as a couple than he and your sister are? \n\nI don't know, it very well *could* just be \"hormones,\" but I'm guessing your sister has noticed how much of an interest you and your BIL seem to have in each other and it's starting to raise eyebrows/breed insecurity in her. \n\nYTA. Maybe tone it down a bit.", "That was a weird comment to make. Did you mean to imply he would be happier with you? Because unless that was your intention, why would you ever say that?

You two could be twins for all we care, it's still inappropriate to make that joke since it seems like you might actually believe it.\n\nThese feelings of yours are nasty and you opt to self reflect.

You shouldn't have made that joke and your family shouldn't have laughed at it. Don't blame it on her hormones either.  That's also an AH move. Your sister is understandably hurt and on top of it you all are invalidating her emotions just because she's pregnant. If I were you? I'd apologize to her. Also? The way you talk about her versus her husband in interests? There has to be common ground somewhere if they are married and it seems you are ignoring that. You need to sit down and think about why you feel all these types of way. It's okay to be friends with an in-law. It's a completely other one to say they should have married you instead.

Your joke would probably have been shrugged off as just that if your BIL's response was to gently wrap his, arm around your sister and say something like \"I think not.\" Geez. His wife is pregnant with his child. What a peach.", "YTA. I get that you meant it as a joke and she probably is a bit extra sensitive right now, but it doesn\u2019t change what you did. Maybe she\u2019s really very self conscious about how they don\u2019t share hobbies and is worried they won\u2019t last, which I presume is extra stressful with a kid coming. Even if you didn\u2019t touch a sore spot, it sounds a bit like you\u2019re hitting on your sister\u2019s husband.

Alright about that.\n\n>When they got together even they used to joke about how different they were, my sister says that \"opposites do attract\" when referring to her relationship.\n\nThey used to joke?

Your sister didn't appreciate it obviously, but everyone else is laughing about your joke. Problem is: You and your BiL are joking about your sister, which obviously is hurt about it!\n\nPlace yourself in her shoes.

Idk what kind of sick aunt/stepmother crap you've fantasized about, but it needs to end now. Wanna know why I think this? Cause you spent several paragraphs talking about how they have nothing in common while you two have so much in common. Don't ever make this \"joke\" again to anyone cause sister is gonna say enough. He will choose her, and you will have a huge split in the family.", "YTA. ur weird asl for that lame ass shit.", "YTA it was an inappropriate joke. I\u2019m sure it stung even worse because her feelings might be a little more intense than usual right now. For future reference, I would maintain strong boundaries with your BIL.

And that's why the sister is upset. I'm absolutely not blaming it on the sister's pregnancy hormones like other people in the comments are, because what her husband said most likely hit every insecurity she could've been feeling in the marriage and that would've hurt regardless of whether she was pregnant or not. Yes, OP is an AH for initiating the joke in the first place, but the biggest AH in this situation for me is the BIL.\n\nEdit: grammar", "ESH- This is a 2 to 3 item combo of things coming together\u2026.\n\n1) hormones\u2026.

What if the baby takes after dad and she has nothing to bond with the baby over as it gets older)\u2026. This was an issue with me and my now ex. \n\n2) Even in good fun, a person can be hurt or made jealous when someone tells the person they love \u201cyou shoulda married me instead\u201d which is what you did.\n\n3) it\u2019s possible that they are having some issues between just the two of them that you don\u2019t know about, so this just hit home extra hard to remind her of issue la that she hoped to get them rough a visit without thinking about", "YTA this is an odd thing to say", "I think when you\u2019re in a healthy relationship, jokes about your relationship can be easily taken in stride and you laugh at it instead of feel offended. \n\nIf you\u2019re having problems already, then any thing can feel like an attack and hurt you. \n\nI don\u2019t think the joke is the problem here. I think it\u2019s that your sister didn\u2019t want to make the effort to do something small your BIL was really interested in. And your joke, light hearted in nature, made it even more obvious that she wasn\u2019t willing to make that small effort of watching a movie her husband wanted to with him.

When they got together even they used to joke about how different they were, my sister says that \"opposites do attract\" when referring to her relationship. \n\nThey met though some common friends and they hitted it off. But they have completely different points of views in almost everything, they don't have any shared hobbies, they don't even like the same kind of movies. For example, my sister is very athletic, she loves sports and when she was in school she won several awards due to her dedication. Her husband on the other hand hates sports. For what he told me he always faked to be sick to avoid PE (I can relate to that lol), his hobbies are more into the creative side. He likes to draw and does it very good, for example. \n\nI can say that my BIL and I have lots of stuff in common and I love to talk with him about our hobbies when we visit each other. I love drawing too and I actually work as an animator. I also love to watch movies/ series and criticize them, he does as well. My sister likes movies, but she'll rather watch a superheros movie (she's a marvel fan) or some comedy than a drama.\n\nAt this point it had been some time since I saw both my parents and my sister/ her husband as I live in a different state so I was trying to catch up with each of them. We were all chatting. We then started talking about the Oscars (I don't even know how the conversation took that turn), my BIL asked me if I had seen \"The whale\", I was like \"you're kidding? Course I saw it!\" And we started talking about it. Then he said that he had tried to get my sister to watch the movie with him but she said it was boring and left after 15 minutes. So I said \"welp, you married the wrong sister!\" And he said \"yeah, i guess so\" My parents, him and I laughed but we stopped laughing when we realized my sister wasn't laughing too. She was just looking disoriented i guess? And suddenly she started crying. She excused and said she was going to the bathroom, my mom went with her. \n\nWe were very worried and weirded out too, so the three of us also went to check on her shortly after. When she came out the bathroom she said that what we (BIL and I) did was very insensitive and made her feel like she wasn't enough for him. We said that's not what we intended and that we just wanted to joke around as we usually do, we didn't meant to hurt her. \n\nShe's better now but still seems a bit upset, specially to me. I tried making small talk but she just brushes me off. My mom told me that since she's pregnant she may have gotten over emotionally because of the hormones. She also said it's best to give her some space and to not do jokes like that anymore. Both my mom and my sister are making me feel like I am an asshole\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

YTA and so is your brother-in-law.", "YTA - Don't try to play innocent, you know the game you are playing here: You explained in 3 paragraphs how you had more in common with your BIL than your sister; you made the joke about him marrying the wrong sister (what did Freud used to said about this jokes? That they are a reflection of inner though?) and then you try to discard your sister feelings, as she is pregnant and hormonal.\n\nYou sound like a snake in the grass or a very competitive sister. Not cool.", "Are you trying to have an affair with your BIL? Or cause a divorce?", "YTA and I\u2019m so embarrassed for you. Who makes a joke like that?! It\u2019s not only unfunny, it\u2019s just really inappropriate. You are 25. Time to learn some tact.", "Your sister is feeling vulnerable.  Her body is changing and she\u2019s very aware.  Your \u201cjoke\u201d just pointed out another thing \u201cwrong\u201d with her. \n\nYTA, it\u2019s never appropriate to point out that you think you\u2019re a better match than the person they are with. It\u2019s even worse the partner agrees with you.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019d just love to know what logic you have for thinking implying your BIL would be better off with you instead of your sister is funny? Especially in front of your sister. Extremely tone deaf of you.", "YTA. Her pregnancy hormones aren't the problem. You and and your \"sense of humor\" are. How do you expect her to react when you said that me married the wrong sister and the said \"yeah\"? Thats like slap in the face.", "YTA. Pregnant or not you deeply hurt your sister. How would you feel if people kept repeatedly saying the same joke of where her *husband* married the wrong sister? Sheesh. If that happened to me I would start overthinking things and wondering what they see. You owe your sister a huge apology and *never* make those jokes again.", "INFO: how long have you been in love with your brother in law?\n\nYTA", "YTA evil, manipulative and dangerous for your sister. Leave them alone.", "Pick me! PICK MEEEEEEEE! \n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like you have a crush on your BIL and think he'd be better off with you with how you described everything in this post, but are trying very hard not to say the quiet part out loud.\n\nIf you care about your sister, apologize, and keep BIL at arm's length at best for a long while. Focus on your sister, if she'll let you. You and BIL don't need to be spending much time together after suggesting you'd be better for him than she is, especially since it clearly upset her. It's not going to help anything. \n\nIf you do have a crush, you're going to have to learn to get over it and yourself. Those feelings aren't special or unique, no matter how caught up in them you may be. If I'm wrong... This is an opportunity for growth either way. Time to be humbled and make good with your sister and think how you might feel in her position.", "YTA. You made a cruel joke and it feels like you have a thing for your BIL and are jealous of your sister. Everyone sucks here except for your poor sister. She just had her husband's family laugh about her not being good enough for him.

I know a lot of people are saying YTA but it sounds from your comments that a common theme in your family is to make jokes along this vein about your BIL and sister being so different. So it\u2019s understandable that you may feel that this joke was no different.  But I do think that you took it too far this time and are not understanding the line that you crossed. \n\n My husband and I are very different and he and my best friend are much more similar.  We joke about it all the time.  But it never ventures into \u201cwell maybe us two should have gotten together instead\u201d because that\u2019s in poor taste, disrespectful to me, and invalidates the things that our marriage actually is built on.  And it\u2019s a fucking weird thing to say tbh.", "YTA and The Whale is a turd of a movie.", "YTA\n\nHere\u2019s what I read\u2014\n\n\u201cMy sister and I are nothing alike! My sister is a dumb jock and isn\u2019t interested in important stuff like art. Even the movies she likes are all dumb superhero stuff and she doesn\u2019t even want to talk about them or analyze them. Her husband is so much more like me. He likes art and drawing and we could spend hours talking about art and books and films that actually challenge your intelligence. Recently he mentioned a movie and said he tried to get my sister to watch it, but she didn\u2019t enjoy it. I joked he should have married me instead of her. Why is she mad?\u201d\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t have a crush on your BIL. Maybe you don\u2019t look down on your sister for having different interests. Maybe. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting both you and your BIL think your sister should accommodate/partake his interests, but don\u2019t think he should make a similar effort for her. \n\nAlso, when you find a partner, I hope he makes a similar joke to your family (example-hey, too bad she\u2019s married, I guess I am stuck with this one). Hey, it\u2019s just a joke right?", "YTA - I am also close with my BIL, we are the same age and often hang out together just the two of us. But we have more of a sibling dynamic ourselves, and neither of us would think to make a comment like that. Also, your sister is pregnant, her hormones are going wild, so apologize to her and ask her how to make amends", "NTA. Seems like it was kind of a running joke in the family because you and BIL have so much in common. My guess is that either the hormones impacted her response or she's not as happy about the lack of things in common with her husband as she like to think and it has become problematic as they go through the pregnancy and talk about values, so maybe it stung a bit when you said that. If you're normally close to your sister, you might check in on if there's a bigger issue going on.", "NTA in my book but probably coz I make the same joke in reverse about my sister and my man. He and my sister have similar taste in soooo many things but they also have similar roles from a relationship dynamics perspective. So when he makes suggestions that is not my cup of tea and 100% my sis (buy something or go somewhere etc), I always joke \u201cYou are with the wrong sister\u201d. Same when my sister complains about something my BIL suggests that goes against her taste I tell her \u201cYou should have been with *MyPartner*\u201d \n\nMe and my BIL are very much alike as well in character but I was never even remotely interested in him and frankly I can\u2019t imagine being with anyone other than my partner, exactly because we are so different that we balance each other out.\n\nI get that it may sound like a terrible joke to some ppl but I think your sister\u2019s reaction is more hormone-driven than anything else. Being pregnant is a very vulnerable time for a woman\u2019s self-esteem anyway. Give her time and apologise when things cool down a bit.", "NTA hormones and she's more sensitive because of that just keep it chill and maybe the husband can talk to his wife and make things better between you two by reaffirming his love for her", "NTA - what a delicate doily, familys can have a laugh about these things. She's just extra emotional because of her pregnancy.", "NAH, I have a strong feeling a lot of people are going to start accusing you of being secretly in love with you BIL lol. However, it seems like this is just your families style of humor.\n\nI don\u2019t think you intentionally meant to hurt your sisters feelings but I think you should apologize. It seems something deeper is going on. Pregnancy brings on not just a lot of hormonal changes, but relationship changes. Maybe your sister feels the connection/bond with your BIL is off at the moment and your joke really hurt her feelings. I\u2019m currently pregnant and oftentimes want to strangle my fianc\u00e9 lol. I love him but pregnancy certainly can put added pressure on a relationship. \n\nCheck in with her and see if she\u2019s okay. Tell her you meant no harm and you\u2019re there if she needs to talk.", "My sisters have had so many husbands if I made this joke one of them would at least laugh.", "Eeewww. YTA.", "> It isn\u2019t funny,\n\nHAHA you should divorce my pregnant sister LOL and marry me HEHEHE because I like the same movies LMAO I'm not like other girls!!\n\n...this post just irritated tf out of me...", "It's not the first time someone jokes about this, other family members have said it before", "I am not jealous, I am happy for her. He's a nice guy and I'm happy that my sister married him, she deserves someone like him", "I don't have a thing for him at all, we just share some hobbies and our personalities are alike so we are good friends", "Omg I love you. You put into words my most hated thing.", "I agree with all of this. It sounds very much like OP finally said the quiet part out loud, and then the husband agreed and everybody laughed?! I would be fucking nauseated if I was the sister.", "I get along great with my sister's husband and it would never even occur to me to make this kind of joke", "I don't like him", "And yet it's OK for him not to go to the gym with his wife? Why is it the wife that has to make the effort and not him? Seriously.\n\nAlso, she's pregnant and regardless of people thinking pregnant woman need to act rational and unemotional that's not how it works.", "I disagree. If anyone was getting along really well with my husband and said \u201cyou should have married me instead\u201d I\u2019d be insulted. If my husband agreed? I\u2019d be devastated. \n\nWe have a healthy marriage, and it\u2019s a pretty reasonable boundary to say \u201cdon\u2019t tell other people you wish you\u2019d married them instead of me\u201d\n\nIt does sound like the wife could put more effort into her husbands interests, but we do only get a glimpse of one conversation in their relationship, and a narrator who benefits from us having this opinion. It also sounds like the husband should put more effort into understanding his wife\u2019s interests, since it sounds like he doesn\u2019t do that either. \n\nOr, they can just have a healthy relationship where they each have their own interests. You can support someone\u2019s interests without being involved in them. My husband is really into skateboarding, and I\u2019m really prone to breaking bones. Bad combo. I\u2019m really into snakes, and my husband is scared of them, so I entertain that hobby by myself. \n\nI think their relationship could do with some healthy communication, but the sister is certainly making things worse in this situation.", "be silent.", "When you joke that he's with the wrong sister, does your husband agree with you?", "Or you know, just apologize like a decent human being instead of relying on the husband to clean up your mess.", "This is not a hormone thing, it's an incredibly disrespectful joke to make.", "Yeah, naw, OP getting the husband involved would make shit worse. This is between the 2 sisters and then wife and husband, the husband getting involved unless it's to back his wife is a disaster.", "\ud83d\udc4e", "What a sexist take. Pregnant women are allowed to be hurt and not have it chalked up to hormones.", "This only makes your joke worse, seems like you're too attached to him.", "The fact that this is often joked about may be why she's so sensitive about it. If she's at all insecure about her relationship, think about it would feel like to constantly be reminded of your inadequacy.", "Is this the first time he flat out agreed? \n\nThis is so weird. I would never imply I want a relationship with my BIL. That's so creepy. And for others to also do it.... Ewwwwww", "Well, there you have it then, mystery solved. Others have also apparently noticed how much of an interest you two take in each other, and you and your BIL went ahead and confirmed it for everyone with that \"joke.\" It's no wonder why your sister was so upset. \n\nYou and your BIL need to bring this whole flirty/ideal hypothetical couple thing down several notches, as it's clearly hitting a nerve with your sister. It's wonderful that you get along with your BIL, but you are *both* crossing some major boundaries and taking it way too far by continually implying that you two should have ended up together instead of him marrying your sister. \n\nYou are both being insensitive and you both owe your sister an apology.", "So people are consistently commenting that he shouldn\u2019t have married your sister? No wonder she is so fucking upset", "You come on AITA to ask about your AH move and proceed to justify your AH move to everyone telling you it was an AH move. \n\nStop. \n\nApologize to your sister. Not sure she should accept because I\u2019m sure she\u2019s endured years of micro aggressions from you.", "In that case, YTA. \n\nOne joke is probably a joke, but lots of people repeatedly making the same joke is all those people trying to get away with saying something insulting they think is the truth. And that's undermining your sister's emotional well-being and her confidence in her self and her relationship. It's verging on bullying. \n\nSo stop doing it, and stop laughing when anyone else in your family does it. And apologise. \n\nBesides, having interests in common doesn't necessarily mean you'd make a good life partner. Can't you just be happy that your sister has chosen a husband that you can be good friends with, and support her marriage?", "If you\u2019re truly not jealous, then you might want to reflect on why after reading a short summary of the events, told from your point of view, multiple strangers on the internet assumed that you were. \n\nBecause if in person you\u2019re giving off anything near the vibes you have off in this post, then it\u2019s likely people in your family have similar suspicions. And you should work on that.", "Even phrasing it this way and you guys joking about it repeatedly is weird. How about how great she is?", "Then stop saying he should have married you. DO you want him to leave your sister?", "So why are you pushing for a divorce?", "Even if that\u2019s true, consider that people in your family may be getting the same impression that multiple people here are.", "Ok but even then you made a comment \u201cyou married the wrong sister\u201c that gives us the impression that you liked him.
