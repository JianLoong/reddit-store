You already have a difficult physical condition to deal with and don't need any of their comments about your appearance. And you also do not need to behave more girl-like just because they have hangups about what a boy is supposed to be like.\n\nI'm so sorry for you. I hope you can move out soon, and maybe get a therapist while you still live there. They are not treating you well at all.", "NTA \u2014 that\u2019s f*cked. I\u2019m glad your GP found it and they\u2019re starting to correct this. \n\nMaybe try some counseling, you\u2019ve been living with this condition for many years and it\u2019s important to process how people have treated you but also to look at how your parents now treat you. Maybe a good counseling could help you communicate to your parents. This is a bizarre situation and I\u2019m sorry it is so damaging.", "Of course you're NTA. Your parents are acting very strangely. \n\nHave they got very strong opinions on trans matters? I wonder if that's affecting their response. You need to make it very clear that you're their son, always have been and always will be; your identity hasn't changed. \n\n>bra \n\nA chest binder would be more appropriate; these are used by transmen to give a flatter appearance to their chest while awaiting a mastectomy. \n\n>because my bones would be weak from this condition. \n\nIf this becomes an issue (eg if you start breaking) there is a group of medicines called bisphosphonates that improve bone density. They might become relevant for you in future. They're most often used for osteoporosis but can be used on people of any age with low bone density.", "NTA\n\nWTF is wrong with your parents.\n\nI'm assuming you have KS?  I'd think that a discussion with a doctor about how to reduce the growth or even remove some of the tissue would be a better option than wearing a bra - which isn't going to hide your breasts - even a minimizer bra can't hide noticeable breasts.  Even if it could it should be your choice to wear something.", "NTA and it sounds like you\u2019re parents aren\u2019t necessarily assholes either - they don\u2019t know what they are doing and probably are worried about your health conditions and aren\u2019t being as tactful as they should be. \nIf you do find your chest is uncomfortable, I would recommend lounge supportive crop tops, as it can be a lot more comfortable than being free. That said, it\u2019s completely your prerogative to wear what you like, and your aren\u2019t don\u2019t really have a say in it.", "NTA although I'm wondering if your parents don't really understand the condition? This is not at all your fault but I'm curious as to how involved they have been with the doctors stuff, maybe they have the wrong idea?", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry your parents are reacting like that. It sounds like, even if they don't mean to, they're making you feel like your body is shameful.\n\nIf wearing a bra is really troubling you, you can get chest binders designed for men with gynecomastia. Maybe check them out? There are issues wearing them for long stretches, though.", "i cant even imagine being told to wear a bra as man. thats just so mean in this context. NTA", "NTA, but your parents are kinda off. I know this is reaching far but i'm wondering if you were born intersex, they kept it from you and now are scared you don't feel okay with the gender they picked for you.", "NTA. You\u2019re a teenager who feels misunderstood by your parents. You\u2019re obviously going through a difficult period with your health while things fall back into balance (once the T starts having effect) you should be able to feel supported by your family. Unless you\u2019re walking around with absolute mommy milkers your back won\u2019t suffer. It\u2019s just important to maintain a healthy lifestyle that includes muscle strengthening exercises so your back can remain strong and flexible as you get older. I\u2019m sure your health professional can advise the best way to do that (which you\u2019re entitled to seek advice without your parents present if you choose to)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA", "nta your parents are weird for even suggesting this...", "Nta. Your parents probably don't know how to deal qith this. If you find your chest becoming a bother you could look into a well fitting sports bra, a cinder for ftm/trans/genderbuetral, or if possible let a breast reduction or top surgery.", "NTA and Shouldn't they do the opposite? If you started testosterone you should be more masculine, so why start treating you as a female now? Makes no sense", "Yeah its honestly strange. Im not the most masculine person and most would consider me feminine so its weird they they have totally flipped from treating me like how they did to treating me more like a daughter since my behaviour has stayed the same. I get wanting me to be physiclly careful but it doesnt explain their other ways they treat me diffrent. \n\nLuckly enough my gp got me a great therapist that i love a while ago.", "I think im already one that medicine or something similar along with an infusion treatment they want me on once a year. I havent heard their opinions on trans issues but i have been asked in the past by my mum of i was. I honestly would not mind wearing a bra if it would help and make things more comfortable i think its the way it was brought up that set me off and that they also made it an issue of me not wearing one being inappropriate.", "Binders are really bad for you, and as OP doesn't seem to mind having noticeable breasts, I absolutely would not suggest wearing one just to appease his parents.", "They thought so at first but genetic testing showed its not there or something like that.

Dad on the other hand doesnt understand any medical conditions, even his own lol so i think he just follows mum.", "No, no intersex condition.

Always had back issues anyway so idk why their attitudes changed towards it and they suddenly care now.", "Ikr, its strange and no reason to treat me diffrent anyway and if they were to shouldnt the treatment go in the opposite direction than treating me like a daughter.", "Your parents really do need to learn to bite their tongue sometimes. It's your body and your choice. \n\nIf you want to explore the option of wearing a bra for comfort reasons, then have a look at sports bras. They don't look particularly feminine and are designed purely to stop everything flapping around when you're running.", "Yeah, I agree that is shitty of them. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having this problem with your parents", "Oh, the way you described them as noticeable I was thinking like a B/C cup. Either way it\u2019s still your decision how to manage it, you\u2019re nearly an adult you can absolutely hang wild and free if you choose to", "Do your parents go to therapy? Because they really, really should", "Oh sorry if that makes it seem like im down playing the situation by saying \"noticable\". They are like a C or D and haven been since i was 15. Havent measured exactly since that kinda makes it real but thats what ive been told.", "The letter grades are how many inches difference in circumference compared to your rib cage. So an A is Ribs +1inch AA is ribs +2 inch. Assuming you\u2019re a D, that would be ribs +7 inches.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing feminine about knowing the size of your body and you can absolutely be mindful of the size in a purely practical medical way, to assess any changes. This is something women have to think more about yes but it\u2019s still important for every person to understand. I hope you can take comfort knowing it\u2019s completely normal to want to understand your own body", "Thank you for that, ive been contemplating for a while, even before this situation that i might measure and go out and get a bra since my cousin said she would help and has been encouraging me to get one for my actual health (unlike my parents). This whole thing has kinda made me more hesitant tho because it feels like im giving into my parents if i did. My brain is constantly torn on it.", "Let me offer you this. Would you avoid a good solution because your enemy came up with it in any other circumstance? If you feel like trying on a bra could help you find some relief, try one. \n\nI worked at a lingerie store so let me share the fitting advice since you likely want to avoid asking these questions in person (not that you should feel embarrassed I just know it can be hard to even know what to ask)\n\nMake sure every bra is well fitted (by knowing your measurements) so it doesn\u2019t cause irritation. Wires offer more rigid support but there is a wide range of non-wired/surgical bras available nowadays for softer support. I already explained how sizing code works as the ribs + inches =letter grade, and the only other thing to explain is how to make sure it\u2019s a good fit.\n\nThe band gives 80% of the support so if it\u2019s too loose or too tight you won\u2019t be comfortable or supported. You should be able to gently fit 2 fingers under the band, if it pulls away from the body further than that it\u2019s too big, and if your fingers feel squished it\u2019s too small.\n\nIn the cup, you should get a smooth line across where the cup ends and the rest of your chest continues. If you get spillage or \u201c4 boobs\u201d the cup is too small. If you have a cavity between your chest and the bra, it\u2019s too big. As a side note, you should always fit to the larger side. Most right handed people use the muscles on that side more, and end up with a smaller right breast as a result, so if that\u2019s the case and you find the left feels perfect and the right has a cavity, you should consider that a good fit. \n\nThe shoulder straps should use the 2 finger method again. If you find that they\u2019re doing most of the work to hold you up and cause digging in lines that dont go away after taking the bra off for an hour, it\u2019s likely that the band might be the issue.\n\nYou may want to consider different shaped bras as well as different compression and support. Some bras can minimise the appearance while others accentuate and lift. Sports bras offer tight support but wearing them for prolonged periods of time (ie all day at school or work) can make you feel suffocated. Some bras will give you 2 very distinct breasts while others form a \u201cboob log\u201d across which might be more desirable in your case.", "Firstly, NTA. \n\nIt's not clear what the reasoning behind your parents pushing you to wear a bra is, whether it's something weird or if they are trying to help you be more comfortable and have just really missed the mark in the way they broached the topic. \n\nEither way, it's absolutely your choice. And if you don't want a full traditional style bra there are other options that might be more comfortable for you, both physically and mentally. Some already mentioned sports bras, there are also just crop top style ones. Or you could try tightly fitting singlets. You can also get singlets that have a 'built in' bra which more like additional fabric to support the chest area than it is actually a real bra. I've tried a lot of these different things because my back issues make traditional bras hell to wear. There really are many possibilities between different styles of garment and different brands.\n\nSounds like your cousin is supportive without being pushy and that's awesome of her. If you decide you want to take her up on her offer of helping you out, another suggestion might be to see if you can connect with some local trans support groups. Not because you're trans, of course, but they may have tips on underwear/lingerie stores in your area that are good about working with people that don't necessarily fit into the \"standard\" binary sex/gender types. The last thing you need when you're trying to find what's best for you is a nasty sales person. You can shop online of course but sometimes being able to see and try on makes a big difference.", "Thank you sooooo much for all this. Unfortunatly i dont think i could wear any bras that reduce my size since i have a port in my chest for infusions and it would probably really hurt so any suggestions on what type of bras would accomodate that. Also i had no idea about one breast being bigger, i knew one was lopsided and i wasnt just crazy lol.", "The trans idea is such a good idea that my cousin has already suggested i talk to her trans friends lol. Witch is understandable since it is the closest experience to being trans without being trans so i can see how advice and stuff would translate well.", "Surgical bras are likely the most adaptive and soft and if you search the web you can find bras with better designed straps that may accommodate your port.\n\nSurprisingly nursing bras can be useful too. Nursing bras have a clip to easily access the nipple for feeding babies, but they\u2019re very soft and forgiving in terms of sizing because of how much breasts change post-partum. Given the placement of the clip I think they could be easily adapted to account for the space needed around your port"]}
