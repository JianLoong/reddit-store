I'd think that a discussion with a doctor about how to reduce the growth or even remove some of the tissue would be a better option than wearing a bra - which isn't going to hide your breasts - even a minimizer bra can't hide noticeable breasts.

It's your body and your choice. \n\nIf you want to explore the option of wearing a bra for comfort reasons, then have a look at sports bras.

Because they really, really should", "Oh sorry if that makes it seem like im down playing the situation by saying \"noticable\". They are like a C or D and haven been since i was 15.

So an A is Ribs +1inch AA is ribs +2 inch. Assuming you\u2019re a D, that would be ribs +7 inches.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing feminine about knowing the size of your body and you can absolutely be mindful of the size in a purely practical medical way, to assess any changes. This is something women have to think more about yes but it\u2019s still important for every person to understand. I hope you can take comfort knowing it\u2019s completely normal to want to understand your own body", "Thank you for that, ive been contemplating for a while, even before this situation that i might measure and go out and get a bra since my cousin said she would help and has been encouraging me to get one for my actual health (unlike my parents). This whole thing has kinda made me more hesitant tho because it feels like im giving into my parents if i did. My brain is constantly torn on it.", "Let me offer you this. Would you avoid a good solution because your enemy came up with it in any other circumstance? If you feel like trying on a bra could help you find some relief, try one. \n\nI worked at a lingerie store so let me share the fitting advice since you likely want to avoid asking these questions in person (not that you should feel embarrassed I just know it can be hard to even know what to ask)\n\nMake sure every bra is well fitted (by knowing your measurements) so it doesn\u2019t cause irritation. Wires offer more rigid support but there is a wide range of non-wired/surgical bras available nowadays for softer support. I already explained how sizing code works as the ribs + inches =letter grade, and the only other thing to explain is how to make sure it\u2019s a good fit.\n\nThe band gives 80% of the support so if it\u2019s too loose or too tight you won\u2019t be comfortable or supported. You should be able to gently fit 2 fingers under the band, if it pulls away from the body further than that it\u2019s too big, and if your fingers feel squished it\u2019s too small.\n\nIn the cup, you should get a smooth line across where the cup ends and the rest of your chest continues. If you get spillage or \u201c4 boobs\u201d the cup is too small. If you have a cavity between your chest and the bra, it\u2019s too big. As a side note, you should always fit to the larger side. Most right handed people use the muscles on that side more, and end up with a smaller right breast as a result, so if that\u2019s the case and you find the left feels perfect and the right has a cavity, you should consider that a good fit. \n\nThe shoulder straps should use the 2 finger method again. If you find that they\u2019re doing most of the work to hold you up and cause digging in lines that dont go away after taking the bra off for an hour, it\u2019s likely that the band might be the issue.\n\nYou may want to consider different shaped bras as well as different compression and support. Some bras can minimise the appearance while others accentuate and lift. Sports bras offer tight support but wearing them for prolonged periods of time (ie all day at school or work) can make you feel suffocated. Some bras will give you 2 very distinct breasts while others form a \u201cboob log\u201d across which might be more desirable in your case.", "Firstly, NTA. \n\nIt's not clear what the reasoning behind your parents pushing you to wear a bra is, whether it's something weird or if they are trying to help you be more comfortable and have just really missed the mark in the way they broached the topic. \n\nEither way, it's absolutely your choice. And if you don't want a full traditional style bra there are other options that might be more comfortable for you, both physically and mentally. Some already mentioned sports bras, there are also just crop top style ones. Or you could try tightly fitting singlets. You can also get singlets that have a 'built in' bra which more like additional fabric to support the chest area than it is actually a real bra. I've tried a lot of these different things because my back issues make traditional bras hell to wear. There really are many possibilities between different styles of garment and different brands.\n\nSounds like your cousin is supportive without being pushy and that's awesome of her. If you decide you want to take her up on her offer of helping you out, another suggestion might be to see if you can connect with some local trans support groups. Not because you're trans, of course, but they may have tips on underwear/lingerie stores in your area that are good about working with people that don't necessarily fit into the \"standard\" binary sex/gender types. The last thing you need when you're trying to find what's best for you is a nasty sales person. You can shop online of course but sometimes being able to see and try on makes a big difference.", "Thank you sooooo much for all this. Unfortunatly i dont think i could wear any bras that reduce my size since i have a port in my chest for infusions and it would probably really hurt so any suggestions on what type of bras would accomodate that. Also i had no idea about one breast being bigger, i knew one was lopsided and i wasnt just crazy lol.", "The trans idea is such a good idea that my cousin has already suggested i talk to her trans friends lol. Witch is understandable since it is the closest experience to being trans without being trans so i can see how advice and stuff would translate well.", "Surgical bras are likely the most adaptive and soft and if you search the web you can find bras with better designed straps that may accommodate your port.\n\nSurprisingly nursing bras can be useful too. Nursing bras have a clip to easily access the nipple for feeding babies, but they\u2019re very soft and forgiving in terms of sizing because of how much breasts change post-partum. Given the placement of the clip I think they could be easily adapted to account for the space needed around your port", "Idk if it helps? But have you ever heard of chest binders? They basically flatten out your chest to appear more flat. NTA obviously your parents were seriously over the line. Even if you were a girl, suggesting that not wearing a bra is inappropriate is bullshit! I hated when my mother said that. And they shouldn't have mentioned it when this is obviously hard on you.", "NTA. That's really gross of them to do, even if you were a girl. I'd be pretty upset with my parents if they had a an unwarranted family meeting just for them to police my breasts. Especially at 17 years old, you are capable of going to them and telling them if you need sportsbras, or binders, or surgical reduction, etc.", "NTA\n\nPlease speak to your parents and your physician about having the breast tissue removed, though.  Since you have enough breast tissue to show up and make them think you need support, that means you may want it removed.  \n\nA friend years and years ago had a son in your situation.  Having the breast tissue removed made him have a much better attitude toward his own body. \n\nBras because they think you need one because it is inappropriate though?  Total BS.    \nIm an over 50 female and have not worn a bra in years.  My mother finally gave up, thank goodness.  I\u2019m way for comfortable without the lymph nodes under my arms being squashed.", "NTA but I do question why you are reluctant to wear a device that would provide benefits.   It's not inappropriate to go without the item, but it might be needlessly proud and stupid.", "It warms my heart that this thread is so helpful and supportive. I'm glad OP has people in real life AND online who are caring and non judgemental. I have no advice to add, but OP, you sound like you have a good head on your shoulders and I think you are going to be just fine in spite of the tough circumstances you've been dealt. Continue to be true to yourself and stick with people who love and support you.\n\nForgot to add: obviously NTA. BUT don't let others' opinions keep you from doing something you think would benefit you. Taking care of yourself is the priority.", "NTA, not even AFAB people \"have to\" wear a bra. It's for the individual's comfort, not others. No one gets to police your clothing choices. \n\nAlso- if your bones are fragile why tf would someone encourage you to wear a bra? Barely anyone actually perfectly fits into their bra cuz the industry is so messed up about sizing. Seems like it would hinder more than help.", "NTA", "WTF? You have an endocrine disorder and now you need to wear a bra?\n\nNTA\n\nTell them to call the endocrinologists' office and get educated or get sent towards groups that can provide them with information and support. This is a them issue - not a you issue.", "Born female here. I don't wear bras just cause I hate them. Doesn't matter how big the boobies get or what gender you are. It's YOUR choice and YOUR body and comfort. I actually just straight up hate bras so much lol. Plus it's a total myth that bras help the health of boobs. It more comes down to genetics. (Ofc bigger boobs can cause back problems but the only sure fire way to sort that is a reduction, not a bra)\n\nI now sonetimes wear binders instead but that's cause I'm NB and don't like having the boobs be obvious sometimes lol. A binder that is made to body specifications is surprisingly comfy. But sometimes I just go to work without binder or bra! The important thing to know, is it's your choice.\n\nHope the situation gets better for you", "Talk to your GP. They are best placed to advise about whether there are any health reasons for you to wear anything other than your normal clothes.  If they do recommend it, I am sure that there are other options than a bar (something closer to a binder, or a support for your back, but I suspect that the doctor would already have told you iff that was something they felt you needed.", "Yeah, us born female + identify female can go through the same thing. Not wear a bra to see if it's comfortable but wear a bra because not wearing one is 'unseemly' and 'wrong'. Just we often get told at a younger age so it doesn't seem as bad that parents are dictating such stuff. But there are teens who give up on wearing bras and get shit from their parents for it. \n\nI'm not in the US but since COVID kicked off I've changed to wearing a bra only sometimes. And most people don't notice and nobody cares. I will wear one if I'm out and about a lot and for formal situations but a quick trip to the shops I don't bother any more. I have a decent amount of boobage so if I'm active it does help to have a bra on, but kicking around at home there's no need to wear one and more comfortable that way. \n\nIf you have boobage you can try one out on your own terms if you want to, but yeah your parents are out of line. I hope your parents can acknowledge you're a person and have your own choices about things and don't fit into the boxes.\n\nI'm female, identify as female, but in a chunk of ways I'm male. So I'm kind of gendered and genderless at the same time. I'm kind of a 'they' personality. I don't mind being female, but I don't like it when people assume things about me just because I am and there's no reason to think it applies (e.g. buy me pink stuff, flowers or toiletries because I don't have a dangle).", "Bras are not comfortable and were never designed to be comfortable. I cried so much the first time I tried one on because of how uncomfortable they are. You could try a sports bar though", "Absolutely NTA. Your parents are being weird and sexist, and you aren't imagining it. You feel like a guy, so you're a guy no matter how androgynous you look or how \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" society labels your interests or appearance. They're treating you the way they're seeing you, not how you see yourself, and that's hurtful and not ok. I'm glad you're getting the treatment you need and are on the road to feeling better.\n\nRe bras helping your back, they don't. Not unless someone has breasts large enough that they can feel the weight pulling them forward, and maybe not then, I don't know. But that doesn't sound like the case for you. And also a lot of people with breasts who stopped wearing bras during covid lockdown discovered that their breast tissue was healthier and more elastic once they stopped wearing a bra. So your parents are even more full of shit.", "If your chest bothers you, your insurance may pay for a reduction. Many men have gynecomastia. Some people use cool sculpting for this but it is an off label use. \n\nInstead of wearing a bra, you could  wear Spanx undershirts for men or a similar brand. They would offer you support without looking feminine. Dressing for your body type would also help. For example, button down shirts with breast pockets work really well. If you prefer tshirts, try to find graphic loose fitting ones. Don't let your parents pressure you to dress as the opposite gender. Many women don't wear bras either. \n\nGlad you found a good doctor who can help.", "Well so you can do bindings instead if you want to look more masculine/flat chested. A lot of FTM start out that way before they get top surgery.", "Sports bras are comfy IF you are interested. \n\nI'm sorry you are dealing with this.", "Lots of people have already suggested sports bras but if you're more interested in support than concealing, a bralette might be the most comfortable option (speaking as a woman, bras kind of SUCK). Meundies makes bralettes in over 100 prints/colours, the fabric is SO SOFT and they look more like a cropped tank top than a bra, imo. I personally find sports bras to be a bit constricting, which is good for sports but not always comfy in daily life. A bralette gives you some support without strangling your ribcage. https://www.meundies.com/products/u-back-bralette?pc=JWR", "Idk why you're getting downvoted here, this is factual information. Binders are a huge boost to the mental health of trans guys and other people who are dysphoric about having full chests, but they're also demonstrably terrible for your ribcage, spinal health, and lung capacity when worn for extended periods of time. They should be used as a long-term intervention only to counteract severe dysphoria and should be worn for as short of a time daily as is safely possible. If OP is cool with having visible breasts, or would get the same amount of relief from wearing even a high-compression sports bra, he does not need to wear a binder and especially shouldn't start doing so just because his parents are being weird to him about his breast tissue. Source: butch lesbian who has bound and has many 20s-30s transmasc friends who have bound unsafely due to severe dysphoria and ended up with reduced lung capacity or spinal issues.", "They are, as they can damage the breast tissue, but as OP is a guy I don't think they'd mind and possibly would be a short term solution, **IF** they are interested in chest masculinisation surgery.", "Aren't some instances of intersex(uality?) caused by hormones? Like it doesn't necessarily need to be the result of chromosomes? I am not at all familiar with intersexuality, but cursory googling seems to indicate that hormone-based intersexuality could be a thing.", "I also suspect that sportbras are more comfortable than binders, but I don't know if that's the case.", "Also not in the US. I only wear bra to deal with boob sweat and that only became an issue when they grew into a c/d cup.", "It is", "Hahaha i definetly agree, unfortunatly not. Mum would but cant afford it rn and dad says \"it just doesnt work for me\" after the 1 session he had years ago.", "A well made, properly fitted binder is just as comfortable (though obvs tighter due to the nature of a binder) as a well made, properly fitted sports bra, speaking as someone that has worn both. A binder provides more compression, and in this case I'd be concerned about it causing damage to OPs ribs if his bones are already fragile.", "They are. The binders I've worn tend to compress the chest to be pretty flat and can be constraining around the ribs. Sports bras don't get you as flat but they keep everything from going all higgledy-piggledy.", "If your parents want to be more use, they should be putting pressure on your consultant for you to get surgery if that\u2019s what you want.", "Im sorry but that is dumb as hell. I would have a low opinion of my parents after hearing that. I won't even get into why your dad would have money and your mom not but i bet it's related to the issues. \n\nMeh. I feel bad for you. Make sure you listen to your therapist more than your parents mate", "Oh i absoloutly do, me and my brothers realised our parents are idiots pretty early on. It is entertaining though, especially times when i was younger and my dad or mum would take over (not that we asked them to, they just would because we were \"doing it wrong\") a school project for me or my brothers and end up with an F for something like a 2nd grade biology or math project.", "Try Spanx tshirts for men.", "Lmao that's funny", "I recommend a brand called MINDD. I\u2019m a large-breasted female, and even though the MINDD bras are soft with no underwire, they provide good support (without being \u201ctoo supportive\u201d if that makes sense) and due to their soft fabric nature, they may be gentle on your stent/port.\n\nI\u2019m lopsided size-wise myself (left one is significantly larger than the right because I\u2019m left-handed) and the MINDD bra also helps mask that/keep things balanced so my back doesn\u2019t hurt as much. \n\nThey ARE expensive (well, all bras are, sigh lol) but I can say I personally feel they\u2019re worth the cost. They\u2019re easy to wash (I throw em in with my shirts, which I wash on Delicate) and you can tumble dry them (but since they\u2019re thin-ish cloth, I hang mine to dry personally, and they dry fast!) \n\nAlso - NTA.

And overwhelming. I'd really recommend looking at r/abrathatfits. Great resource, lots of helpful people, and likely to be really useful if you post looking for help with your situation. \n\nI have large breasts and a small ribcage, which makes finding comfortable bras hard. I really like yoga bras, but if you're having back pain, something that provides even more support is a good idea. Something that fits properly should reduce back pain without adding shoulder pain. \n\nI love this brand: https://shefit.com/\nThey have velcro straps that allow you to adjust the bra to whatever fit you need, are extremely comfortable and super supportive. And they have a zipper in front! They are expensive, but as another comment pointed out, good bras always are. Yay. /s \nIf you're ok with secondhand, you can get one on Mercari or the like for around $30. The fact that they're adjustable means that they can hopefully keep fitting to any size changes the medication might make. \nGood luck!", "I'd second the surgical bra or a sports bra.
