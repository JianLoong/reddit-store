S takes night shift and day shift with E, when I get home I take E for the next few hours and assist S wherever I can around the house.\n\nThe issue is: S has problems with how I phrase things when I'm trying to find out if she needs my help. Ex: I'll ask her, are you sure you got that? Or, are you sure you know what you're doing? Or, are you sure you want to do (task) that way? S gets upset and accuses me of doubting her capabilities as a wife and mom. I keep telling her I know she's a great mom and wife, I'm just trying to see if she needs or wants my help. S wants me to phrase my questions differently as she takes offense to the way I currently phrase them. Personally, I don't see the problem that S does. S wants me to be more mindful and empathetic when I'm asking if there's anything she needs my help with.

You're asking if she really thinks she can do something with the none-too-subtle implication that she isn't capable.

It's unkind.", "YTA because you're saying \"In my opinion she's being overly sensitive\". \n\nYour wife has a valid need for respect and consideration. She is annoyed because you are not only using phrases that literally express doubt about whether she knows what she's doing or is capable of handling, you are also invalidating her legitimate irritation. \n\nShe has a specific, reasonable request. Modify the way you talk to your wife, and while you're at it, modify it with everyone else, too. If your intention is really to help, don't word it this way.

I understand you\u2019re used to speaking this way to everyone but if she\u2019s fully capable and you know so, there\u2019s really no reason to phrase it the way you do. The way it sounds and comes off is as if you know better and have a better way of doing things, but rather than doing so yourself or kindly and gently guiding your partner, you say it in such a demeaning way. That kinda traps her in a corner in a sense. Because while you are offering help, you\u2019re doing it in a way that is in complete disregard to the way she feels. I\u2019m with S on this one.

You're not an asshole for talking the way that you talk, but you are for not taking (or not wanting to take) your wife's feelings into consideration. \n\nLike, I'm trying very hard to think of how I'd take \"are you sure you know what you're doing\" as something other than an insult. I can't imagine someone saying that to me without meaning it disparagingly. It might be hard for you to see as a man, which I assume you are, but that's a phrase women hear a lot, usually from men, usually in a belittling way. It might seem innocuous to you, but there's baggage behind the type of language you use. Even if you don't see it, isn't it worth it to change the way you phrase things for a more harmonious existence with the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with? Why should she change the emotional reaction to the language you use, without you changing your words so she doesn't have that emotional reaction? She should meet you halfway, but you need to meet HER halfway, too. And I'm not saying you're not, but in my experience changing my language is way easier and less stressful than changing the unconscious, illogical way my brain reacts to certain phrases.\n\nAlso, you might think that everyone else in your life doesn't care, but they don't live with you. Something that's normal and accepted from a friend or coworker can become grating if you have to put up with it every day.
