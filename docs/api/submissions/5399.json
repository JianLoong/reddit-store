We met at a restaurant where we were both bartenders, and during this time, I was also working towards a graduate degree. My fiance continues to work in the service industry, and I have taken on a new role since graduating and do fairly well.\n\nI have always had an idea about how much money my fiance makes since we had the same job. However, my fiance also sends money to her family, and I never knew the specifics (e.g. how much money was being sent and for what). I have lent her money in the past when we were just boyfriend and girlfriend, and she always paid me back quickly. I emphasize to her that if she ever needs any help financially to please ask me first. Because she has asked me in the past, and paid me back when she said she would, I had no reason to believe she was in any financial trouble.\n\nNow that we are planning a wedding and going to be spending the rest of our lives together, I am more curious about her financial situation. I ask her things like how much money she has saved, if she has any debt, etc. She hates having this conversation and really tries to avoid it. Eventually I get a rough ballpark estimate from her, but she will never show me proof if I ask for it. She is so uncomfortable with the conversation, and it always ends with me still not being sure how financially secure she is.\n\nFast forward to today. I open our mailbox and see a letter from her bank that is addressed to her. I decide to open the letter, and the letter states that her recent credit request has been denied due to current or past delinquency on one or more of her accounts. I text her and ask her if she she applied for a credit increase and got denied and she said no. I then respond with a screenshot of the letter, and she gets really upset. She is accusing me of being disrespectful towards her for assuming she was in financial trouble when she has come to me for money in the past, and she said I never should have opened her mail since she never opens mine. She says she isn't in debt and everything is fine and that she didn't request anything from the bank. I asked her to send me a screenshot of her credit card statement to prove she wasn't in debt, and she refused saying \"I was already all up in her stuff.\" The conversation ended with me pretty much calling her liar since the letter she got in the mail clearly states otherwise.\n\nI know the letter was addressed to her, but since we are getting married, her financial situation affects me now too. I feel bad for hurting her feelings, but I believe this is information I need to know, and I feel like she is deliberately hiding something from me.

YTA for opening her mail. You obviously have concerns about finances but opening her mail is both an invasion of her privacy and also shows that you are NO WHERE near ready to be married. When people get married, I agree with you, that your finances can be joined and one's debt becomes the other's and so you have a right to know. But your right to know does not include opening her mail. You sit down, lay everything out for each other and discuss. If you wanted to know and are so concerned, you talk to her about it, you do NOT open her mail. It's like snooping through her phone looking for proof. The fact you can't see the indignation of \"send me a screenshot of your bank account\" is appalling. She's not your child and you're treating her like one. And if you can't treat her like an adult and trust her, you definitely should NOT get married.   \n\n\nShe sucks too for not disclosing her financial situation. How does she expect to enter a marriage when there's clearly some things going on financially she won't divulge. If she is struggling and not paying her bills and is delinquent and also asking for a credit increase (I worry about cash advances and credit card cash withdrawals with high interest), then it sounds like she isn't in a position to help out her family at the expense of herself.   \n\n\nApologize for opening ehr mail and invading her privacy. Then ask if you could have a civil conversation about finances and how you see a future together. Some couples NEVER merge their finances.

I open our mailbox and see a letter from her bank that is addressed to her. I decide to open the letter, and the letter states that her recent credit request has been denied due to current or past delinquency on one or more of her accounts. I text her and ask her if she she applied for a credit increase and got denied and she said no. I then respond with a screenshot of the letter, and she gets really upset. She is accusing me of being disrespectful towards her for assuming she was in financial trouble when she has come to me for money in the past, and she said I never should have opened her mail since she never opens mine. She says she isn't in debt and everything is fine and that she didn't request anything from the bank. I asked her to send me a screenshot of her credit card statement to prove she wasn't in debt, and she refused saying \"I was already all up in her stuff.\" The conversation ended with me pretty much calling her liar since the letter she got in the mail clearly states otherwise.\n\nI know the letter was addressed to her, but since we are getting married, her financial situation affects me now too. I feel bad for hurting her feelings, but I believe this is information I need to know, and I feel like she is deliberately hiding something from me.

If anything she's gaslighting because it sounds like she has had problems for awhile since you started dating and she was never once truly honest about it.", "YTA", "YTA for opening the letter. Since that's what you asked.\n\nHowever, her lack of transparency about her finances (probably coming from a place of shame tbh not a desire to harm you) is not healthy and I hope you two can sort that out", "Not so significant other, huh?  \nYou're not looking for a partner. \nSeems clear why she hasn't confided in You.\nIn her rear view.", "ESH \n\nI am confused about the YTA responses directed at OP. He isn\u2019t the only party here that is an AH. Sure, he should not have opened her mail.

That\u2019s a you problem.\n\nAlso, that decision about her credit limit may have been based off a request months or years old, but had finally just come in. Slow your row, OP.", "Yta. If she presses charges, I wouldn\u2019t blame her. \nYou not only broke her trust, you broke the law. Literally.", "ESH. You for invading her privacy and basically did an illegal thing and she for not being honest about her financial situation", "YTA. \nYes you need to have an honest conversation about finances before marriage, but that doesn\u2019t involve going through someone\u2019s mail. \n\nFinances and money is so rooted in culture. Some people do not grow up talking about that or have the same financial values. For instance, you said she sends money to her family. Taking care of her family and supporting them before supporting herself is her value about finances and a responsibility to care for her family that she feels / has. \n\nAdditionally people may have trauma associated with talking about money. Did her parents or loved ones fight a lot about that in front of her? Was she scared of not having money? \n\nBefore just decided to break law and dissolve her boundaries on the topic, you should do some reflection and actually show that you care about partner\u2019s feelings and stop assuming she is hiding things from you on purpose.", "ESH.\n\nStop opening her mail. Don't get married until she reveals just how much debt she is in.\n\nSTD (Sexually Transmitted Debt) is a real thing.", "YTA for opening the letter, but not for wanting to know her financial situation. You should both get a credit report and share it before marrying AND know exactly how much money each has. She is probably embarrassed over her financial situation, but nothing will break up a marriage as quickly as financial problems. If she doesn't comply don't get married.", "YTA. You committed a federal crime because you don\u2019t trust your fiancee. Just break up. You don\u2019t trust her and she doesn\u2019t trust you.", "NTA - Her hiding her finances is a massive red flag when you are planning to be married. GREAT CREDIT  is everything as a married couple.  Her poor credit history WILL be a huge burden for you as a couple and will cost you in so many ways.  It's clear she wants to hide this from you because she's ashamed or afraid of what you may think.  If you are serious about marriage BOTH of you must work together to assess the problem and develop a plan to resolve the marks in her credit.  It's very easy to challenge bad marks and gave them removed from a credit report as long as you attack and stop hiding from the problem.", "YTA it\u2019s illegal to open someone else\u2019s mail.", "ESH. OP is an asshole and a criminal. But fianc\u00e9e is also an asshole. Both need to sit down and provide full disclosure to the other before they tie themselves to each other legally.\n\nBut I am afraid that ship has sailed.", "You are the AH for opening her post.  However she is being evasive and dishonest about her financial situation, which once married will greatly impact you.  You're lack of trust (which seems to be warranted) and her lies this relationship seems doomed without it all laying out in the open and probably therapy.  ESH.", "She shouldn\u2019t have lied, and you should choose to trust her until you have proof not to. Eventually you wouldve found out, just not like this. It does make you look like an asshole, but the blame isn\u2019t all on you, she should\u2019ve been honest with you. Trust is supposed to be an amazing thing, but somehow dating culture has made it into a nightmare.", "YTA- if she won't tell you, that's a red flag. You don't get to open her mail like that.\n\nYou guys need some serious premarital counseling", "NTA\u2026 entirely. Yes - opening her mail was wrong, BUT hiding financial problems from a soon to be spouse is also pretty bad and money issues always end up being a bone of contention in partnerships. Was she hoping that once you were married you\u2019d just assume her debt?", "I do not need to read this. Yes, YTA for opening someone else\u2019s mail. It is in fact illegal in the US. That alone makes you an AH.", "YTA. Mail tampering is a federal crime", "Don\u2019t marry her without seeing her credit card statements and bank account. She sounds like she\u2019s drowning in debt.", "Opening mail not addressed to you is a federal offense OP, it's ILLEGAL! \n\nIf you don't trust the person you are with so much that you resort to opening their mail, then you should 100% not be marrying this person. \n\nBefore getting married both parties should disclose all financials, it's just the smart thing to do. You should also discuss what you want for your future and how to get there. \n\nYTA for not being an adult and setting boundaries with her and consequences, instead opening her mail. Geez. (boundary/consequences: We need to sit down and discuss our current financial situation if you can't do this, then I can't marry you till we do).", "YTA. You violated her trust. You assume that she's lying to you about her finances. Why? Because you know that she sends money to her family and has borrowed money from you in the past. But she's always paid you back. And based on your violation of her privacy, I can't really blame her for being reluctant to talk about her finances with you. Sounds like you've already made up your mind. But what if she was the victim of identity theft and was trying to get it fixed herself. You just called her a liar. And she wouldn't have been lying. Or what if she secretly won the lottery and is trying to figure things out, like can she trust you to have her best interest at heart. Well, she'd really be wondering now after your bonehead moves. Sure, maybe she has some credit card debt, maybe not horrible but she knows that you'll berate her for it. Whatever it is, you're never going to find out and while I am amused that so many people on this thread are so sure that she's financially irresponsible, that's because you portrayed her that way. Without even knowing for sure what her finances really look like. I'm saying that if she's smart, she'll end the relationship. She can make money and get herself out of a financial situation if she needs to, but she can't change the way you treated her and called her a liar. She can't do that. Finances can be fixed but TAness can't. She needs to cut you loose. IMHO.", "Hard agree,\n\nOP - ditch her. She's liar and poor with money. That's not marriage material and you'll save yourself a lot of heartache if you bounce.", "A lot of people want a nest egg if they need to get away from the other person fast. OP and Fiance do not see $ the same way.  Get over this or get out. The snooping is literally criminal.  Ugh. Gross", "It\u2019s not a crime that anyone is going to do anything about.  It\u2019s exactly as assholish as searching someone\u2019s phone.

But past the problem in hand, it's something to decide", "Police complaint over someone else opening their mail? Does that actually happen?", "> Opening someone's mail without their permission can be a crime.\n\nThey're not going to chase someone who lives at that address opening something once.  That could easily be explained as an accident.", "For real. Who gives a fuck about opening one piece of mail addressed to your fiance that you live with?
