It's clear that is where the issues started.", "The title of your post is incredibly misleading. This baby never was and never will be YOUR baby if your sister doesn't want it to be. You have no right to it if it wasn't created to your husband's sperm or your egg.\n\nYTA for being an entitled jerk and expecting her to just GIVE you her child. Your family also sucks for encouraging her to go through with such a heavy and personal decision simply for YOUR benefit, especially if she originally wanted to terminate the pregnancy and your family bullied her. Judging by your own sense of entitlement, I'm going to guess the rest of your family is just as toxic.\n\nYou have no obligation to care for or provide shelter for your pregnant sister. But doing so ONLY on the idea that you get her CHILD out of that kindness is sick and selfish. And no court would ever grant you custody with no legal documentation signifying you as the guardian of the unborn child upon its birth. Your sister already went through an agency. You have no standing.", "YTA. The people your sister picked are they really \u201croommates\u201d or a gay couple that you believe don\u2019t deserve a baby", "YTA. A baby isn't something like a dog that you can take over cause someone doesn't want anymore. She would have to watch that baby grow make her miserable.\n\nIts pretty mean you take advantage of her misfortune and demand that she act as a \"free surrogacy\". Do you want a baby? Get by the book. I know that might be difficult for you, but she doesn't have to accommodate your wishes. If you want to adopt, get in line.\n\nA baby isn't a handout, thats her choice to do.\n\nEdit: misstype", "YTA\n\nI have a gut feeling there's a reason she doesn't want to give you her baby. Especially since you kicked her out as soon as you found out. It doesn't sound like you care about her or her wellbeing, she was just a vessel to create a baby for you.\n\nGiving up your child is one of the hardest things a person can do. She has every right to choose the parents she feels most comfortable with. Your friends are right, you weren't owed this baby.\n\nAlso you would loose a custody battle. Its not your baby, you have no claim to it. You might as well fight to get custody of some random stranger's kid, you can't just take someone else's child without their consent.", "YTA.\n\nSounds like she made the right choice considering you and your family courses of action.", "You talked her into having the baby and putting the child up for adoption.  You had not done the legal paper work.  Here's the thing.  This is her child right now, no legalities had been done.  She's made a different decision despite your allowing her to live with you.  You're now hurt and angry.  This is a difficult situation at best  At the end of the day the most important issue is... ensuring the health of that child, the child's best interest and you and your husband responded by kicking her out.    This was not in the best interest of that baby.  YTA", "YTA, you convinced her to keep the baby so it sounds like that was something she didn\u2019t wanna do in the first place. She\u2019s not your personal incubator", "YTA for so many obvious reasons which I won\u2019t even bother to spell out because this screams  bait post.", "YTA. You browbeat her to keep a pregnancy she did not want. She\u2019s taking steps to give the child up for adoption, which is her choice. *You get no say.*", "YTA - you were using her. You don\u2019t care at all about her, she was just something to use up and get a baby out of.", "Of course YTA.\n\nFurthermore, you're both so shockingly inhumane that you shouldn't just be ashamed of yourselves, you should be seeking professional help to sort out how you ended up so disturbingly self-involved and lacking in even the most basic sense of empathy.\n\nYou looked at your own younger sibling who was in a terribly vulnerable situation and saw nothing but OPPORTUNITY for yourselves. So much so, in fact, that when the personal opportunity for gain from her situation disappeared, you literally kicked her to the curb. I don't know what's wrong with you, but without exaggeration, it's really quite terrifying the degree to which you can't even see how messed up your priorities and lack of empathy are.\n\nYou treated your sister like an incubator. Not even like a potential surrogate whose child you might adopt, in a thoughtful manner, but like a literal incubator, without any thought for her feelings or perspective or how any of this might affect her - again, YOUR  OWN SISTER - as the person who was pregnant with a baby she didn't want. Not only did you coerce her into continuing a pregnancy that she told you she didn't want, which is abusive in itself (forced pregnancy/coercive reproduction obviously has horrific mental health repercussions, given that you're literally making someone grown an entire human inside of their body against their will, changing their body permanently, and having to spend months feeling it all happening despite their aversion to it) . . . it never seems to have occurred to you that by you and your husband adopting this child, she would have to either spend the rest of her life interacting with them at family occasions and constantly being reminded of the pregnancy she never wanted, or choose to be cut off from her own family. \n\nThere is a reason why even women who choose to go through with unwanted pregnancies and give the babies up for adoption often prefer not to adopt out to family, and this is it. Your sister deserves not to spend the rest of her life having to be reminded of the pregnancy, and child, that she never wanted. \n\nAnd now, because your sister chose her own mental health and well-being after you coerced and abused her and treated her like a reproductive tool for your benefit, you took the roof from over her head, her safety and security. Is it your legal right? Sure. Are you, as her sibling, a complete AH for it? Absolutely. YTA in every possible way for everything about this.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your baby. It's her baby and she ultimately gets to decide what she wants to do once the child is born.\n\nIf you were so quick to kick her out and cut contact with her that may be reflective of why she didn't want you to be the one raising the child.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your baby and this is indeed a disgusting story. Do you even like your sister? Or is she just a baby incubator for you? Gross.", "Yta.", "Info: what the fuck is wrong with you?", "YTA\n\nand kinda psycho", "YTA. Considering your other posts, you coerced her into keeping the child because you wanted one. Then when she makes the reasonable decision that you shouldn\u2019t raise that child, you call a gay couple roommates. You sound like you\u2019re an asshole in a lot more parts of your life than this.", "Her baby, her choice.     If you had no signed contract and neither of you is the biological parent, you have no legal challenge  and I'm not sure why you think you do.  \n\n\nNormally, I'd say N T A for evicting a family member if they strung you along and lied to you, but it's pretty obvious that you are the ones who strong-armed your sister into continuing the pregnancy out of your own selfishness, and your whole family clearly doesn't actually LOVE your sister or care about her own health and well-being, so very much YTA.", "YTA! You tried to pressure her to have a baby for YOU. It didn\u2019t work. The baby is not yours. Go through an adoption agency if you would like to adopt a baby.", "YTA at absolutely no point was this YOUR baby at all, you wanted it but nothing was legal.", "I can see why your sister would want another person to adopt her baby. You sound like you think her body and child are owned by you which is nuts. And what do you mean by \"roommates\"? YTA.", "YTA. You and your family tried to pressure a vulnerable pregnant woman into continuing with a pregnancy for your own selfish wants. \n\nHer decision is absolutely valid; given your behaviour, why would she trust you? It sounds like she's found a good home for this baby. Go and bully someone else.", "Info: did at any point she actually said she'll give you the baby? \n\nYTA. Even if not, she's allowed to change her mind. And convincing her to give birth just so you can have it is super shitty.\n\n\nAlso, you said she gave the baby to a roommate, but you kicked her out? Are you a landlord or is the roommate also lives with you?", "YTA - Unless your husband impregnated your sister, you have no claim to the baby.", "I had to reread this three times, because I thought I read it wrong. Your title is so misleading it's not even funny! \n\nYTA so very much! By cutting your sister out you probably did her a favor. Ugh, people like you!", "YTA sorry but no one owes you a baby. She\u2019s not an incubator for *your* baby. That\u2019s *her* baby and *she* gets to decide it\u2019s future. People feel so entitled to other peoples uteruses for gestation.", "yta for wanting to fight the adoption. Giv eup on that and adopt another kid", "That\u2019s pretty horrible, you guys made her have a baby so you could take the baby and then when she had the baby adopted legally, you kicked her out. You\u2019re a shitty sister.\nYTA", "YTA.  I think the universe (and your sister) is trying to tell you something.  Like you don't deserve a child. If you can treat your sister like garbage, how would you treat an adopted child if you had a biological child.  I shudder just thinking about it.", "YTA. Your sister can choose however she wants to adopt HER baby. You have no right to the child. And frankly you sound like a horrible mother so it is good that you won\u2019t adopt the baby.", "I'm so glad I live in a country where all this shit is not possible.", "YTA. It's understandable that you were disappointed and hurt by your sister's decision, but it's her body and her choice. Pressuring her into keeping the baby and then punishing her for not giving it to you is unfair and controlling. Family should support each other, not manipulate and cut off contact when things don't go their way.", "YTA\n\nDid you ever consider your sister's future position of Watching You raise her child? Do you realize it could be emotionally triggering for her at every future family event?\n\nI guess she made it right & doesn't have to worry about that or how you'd be as a manipulating parent. At least she doesn't have to watch it from the sidelines now.", "YTA she doesn\u2019t have to let you adopt her child. You don\u2019t have to house her. But you can\u2019t force her to let you have her child.", "I agree that she strung you along a bit for housing, but IT IS NOT YOUR BABY!!! Not legally, as no contract was ever signed. Not physically, since you didn't carry the child. I was leaning towards esh, but your comment shows that you need to speak to a therapist about this unhealthy attachment to a child that is not, and never will be, yours. YTA", "wtf OP. yes, YTA.", "YTA, you're not entitled to anything she has or is willing to give to anyone else. Did she have it set up legally to where you get the baby? No. You hold no ground in trying to take the kid away from the legally agreed parents.", "You did what you did and you still question WHY she didn't want you give you her baby?\n\nYTA", "YTA. I know you're disappointed, but OP, unless the legal paperwork was signed by both you and your husband for adoption already, your sister has the right to make her own decision on who should adopt her baby.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like having the baby around in her life was just too much. \n\nShe handled it badly but it's kind of understandable. \n\nYou can't sue if you had no legal agreement and anyhow, parental rights have to be terminated once the baby is born.", "I mean she probably knew you guys weren't going the greatest parents to that kid. Life doesn't always go the way you want it to. NTA in this instance.", "NTAH for moving her out, but I urge you to NOT have any future dealings with her.", "NTA. For kicking her out.", "ESH her for stringing you along with the pregnancy where you likely paid a lot of her expenses etc because you were going to get her baby. She lied to you.
