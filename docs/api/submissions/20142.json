I have hired an AirBnB beach house for Christmas close to my parents who are both retired, and we are staying for 5 nights. We are a very close knit family and spend Christmas trips together every year. While I have no kids, I am especially close to my sister\u2019s children. \n\nThe AirBnB booking is in my name, on my credit card. All was well, as all my sisters, their partners and kids were all coming and paying their share of the accommodation to me, and my parents are already excited about seeing us all at once. \n\nMy eldest niece who is 23, recently told me that her parents (my sister and BIL) told her she is not invited the Christmas trip, she must stay home to mind their 4 cats, and to lie to the rest of the family to tell us she would prefer to work over Christmas instead. It was clear she was upset at being excluded from the Christmas trip, but she felt she couldn\u2019t go against her parents.\n\nI was upset that they would even consider her not coming, not to mention telling her she\u2019s not invited, and telling her to lie to us.\n\nI told her you are definitely invited, I\u2019m the one organizing it, there is room for you, and you shouldn\u2019t be staying home while everyone else is away at Christmas on a family trip.\n\nI asked can her parents pay for a cat hotel, my niece didn\u2019t think that they wanted to pay for it. I offered to talk to my sister about it, but my niece asked me not to, as she would get into trouble for telling me the truth. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t feel I can just let this go. \n\nI talked to my other sisters about it and I suggested I pay for the cat hotel to avoid confrontation. But they said no, that\u2019s not the right approach.\n\nSo my thoughts are that I speak to my sister on her own (against my niece\u2019s wishes), tell her that I would be really upset if my niece couldn\u2019t come for the Christmas trip, and ask if can they pay for the cat hotel for the 5 nights.\n\nIf she says no, then I will ask my sister if they can reduce their stay at the accommodation from 5 nights to 3 nights, and I will refund them the 2 nights of accommodation which covers the cat hotel for 3 nights.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance my sister and BIL will get really angry at me suggesting this, and say they are not coming at all. They also will be mad at my niece for telling me the truth. They might also say I\u2019m not her parent, and it\u2019s not up to me, which is true. \n\nSide note: Up until very recently I have paid for big ticket items and smaller items for my sister / her children as they were not in a good financial situation and I was earning more money. My sister has a husband and he works full time.\n\nWIBTA if I reduce my sister\u2019s stay at our Christmas AirBnB?", "created_utc": 1687258242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e7toa/wibta_if_i_reduce_my_sisters_stay_at_our/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is the reason they don't want to allow her to come?\n\nNot that it really matters, I'm just curious.  \n\nNTA - it's your reservation, go ahead and reduce the stay to cover the cat boarding.", "WTF?  They're cats.  I have two cats.  I can leave them at home for a week with their automatic feeders and extra disposable litter boxes.  My dog, however, I have to pay for boarding.  But cats, they're so self-sufficient that a sitter isn't necessary.  I say go for it - have your niece's back!!!\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t confront your sister about the cat sitter. Use the cover story against her. Contact your entire family and say you\u2019ve decided to cancel the beach house because your niece won\u2019t be able to come and you want her to be part of the celebration. Say you\u2019ve asked her to request time off at Christmas but if she can\u2019t get it it\u2019s all called off. Sis will then have to find cat sitters or have her holiday cancelled. You can warn the other sisters ahead of time what you\u2019re doing so they don\u2019t spill that you know. I\u2019m guessing though that suddenly your niece will be available. \n\nIn the longer term though, I think you need to offer your niece help to get away from her parents, whether that be help moving out, or helping with therapy. She needs to know some people in the family have her back, and not betraying her trust but finding clever ways to thwart their favouritism will do just that.", "I think you need to talk to them. As long as they have plenty of water and dry food available, cats can survive on their own, but isn't there a neighbor who could check in on them while they're away? Why are they insisting the eldest niece look after their cats?", "Who does this!! ????? Why on earth would they do that. Why would they WANT to? Either there is way more to this than your niece has told you, or your sister and her husband are giant assholes and don\u2019t deserve even 1 night.", "Don't get 4 cats if your solution to a vacation is leaving a child alone to watch them.

But only do this if you're prepared to offer the niece a safe haven or place to stay.", "Yes she\u2019s always been treated this way and is conditioned to not stick up for herself.", "I can attest to the fact that my niece has done nothing wrong. The parents have an issue with her and we don\u2019t understand why", "Exactly this. Who cares if they don\u2019t go?

I feel there is a weird jealousy with the eldest daughter and I don\u2019t understand why.", "At the time we had 7 cats (now 5, r.i.p Jiyara and Nugget) and we left for two weeks. Just leave out extra food and plenty of water - like really plenty of water. We also left the toilets open and plugged and filled sinks. Extra water is most important.\n\nThey also make disposable cat litter boxes so you can leave plenty of options around.\n\nWe have never had any problems.", "This is a great idea because then I don\u2019t have to betray her confidence.

So that\u2019s why I feel like I have to confront them directly.\n\nAgree about helping her with moving out/therapy and we\u2019ve had discussions on both, and looked at accommodation options for her. But she\u2019s also guilted into staying home, and she needs to get to that point I think, of deciding when the right time is to leave. There\u2019s also financial constraints that make it difficult", "I\u2019m sure they could ask a neighbor too.

Your sister and BIL are, though. They sound like they have a golden child, and the daughter ain't it. Someone needs to stand up for her. I say you go through with your plan. Expect a lot of blowback from them (and possibly from family who think you should just keep the peace), but I think the cost would be worth it.", "It\u2019s such a tricky position to be in, but if confronting her parents with the truth might get your niece in trouble - maybe lie.\n\nCreate a huge fuss pretending to be mad at your niece and tell everyone \u2018it\u2019s a family vacation, you can\u2019t believe niece is being so \u2018inconsiderate\u2019 to put earning money before family - say if we\u2019re not all going, you don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re spending time putting this all together and you\u2019re cancelling the Airbnb unless niece gets her priorities in order.\u201d\n\nObviously, it\u2019s not going to solve the problem long term, but might mean your niece doesn\u2019t have to spend xmas alone.", "NTA but If this is the case, I would tell them that they actually aren\u2019t invited. Change of plans. They were so sneaky and manipulative towards your niece, they don\u2019t deserve to go. TBH, I wouldn\u2019t invite anyone who is even a whiff of abuse towards my family on a trip, even if they themselves are family. \u201cOh but I don\u2019t want the drama\u201d drama with who? Two abusers? Who cares? Let them know that once they learn how to treat people (for example- THEIR OWN DAUGHTER), then they can come on a trip no problem.", "Find a way to take her out of that environment and have her live in with you.

I saw in another comment that the son is the golden child. If she is really the only daughter of the family then you have your answer. Your sister and BIL is gender biased. Favoring the boy over the girl and that the girl has to do all the chores and unfavorable tasks.\n\nEdit - I read more of your comments and it seems that they do have a younger daughter as well but treated the same way it seems.  But it still stands the fact that your sister and BIL seems to favor boys over girls.", "You seem like a lovely person with a lovely family. I'm sure you can figure this out. Now gird your loins and get in there(lol)! It'll be worth it in the end, I'm sure (fingers crossed...) Good luck!", "It's just so strange! I wonder exactly what the parents deal is. It's niece perhaps looking to stay home but feels really awkward about it?\n\nedit: I've just read some of your comment replies, and this feels less likely. this feels so icky.", "If you think they\u2019ll bait and switch go big. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t come I\u2019ll call her boss myself!\u201d  \u201c If you don\u2019t make her come none of you are invited to anything again!\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ll go to her job and kidnap her if I have to!\u201d\nBe an over-dramatic AHole if you have to, but make it clear her non-attendance will not be tolerated and there will be consequences for them if she doesn\u2019t turn up. Don\u2019t give them the wiggle room to make last minute excuses. Take it far enough that if they don\u2019t bring her, their cover story will end up being blown. Even if your sister figures something\u2019s up because you don\u2019t normally act like this, the fact you\u2019ve not confirmed you know the real reason gives you plausible deniability. Basically, the best way to counter a passive aggressive b$&ch is to be a passive aggressive b$&ch. And your sister is absolutely one of those. \n\nOne way to help your niece realise she needs to get away is to invite her to stay. Depending on how close you live it could be for a weekend once a month or a longer time less often, but the more she\u2019s afforded space from the toxicity in her nuclear family, the sooner she\u2019ll want to break away.", "Honestly I think the only way to go is loud, messy, & honest.  It sounds like this tiptoeing around their ABUSE of their daughter has been going on for years. It\u2019s a don\u2019t rock the boat bullshit you see in families that allows this kind of insidious abuse to flourish. And make no mistake, there might not be physical abuse or bruises on your niece, but she has been & still being abused by her parents. It\u2019s time to stop worrying about the abusers\u2019 feelings. It\u2019s time for you & your other sister & your parents to say, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Your niece is an adult now but needs to hear everyone say what her parents have been doing is wrong & that you are all here for her now. Let her know she can walk out of that house today into a home of love & support. Her parents\u2019 behavior needs to be brought out loudly & openly. It\u2019s only in everyone\u2019s concern to keep peace that they are provided cover & allowed to continue the abuse.", "I read resentment more than jealousy.

The females get treated the same way.", "Great advice, I am normally a calm person so when I\u2019m mad which is not often, I can be scary. \n\nAgree, she doesn\u2019t live too far so will offer her to stay.

Either you pull her out and take her to live with you or leave her alone.", "NTA on your part and thank you for trying to help them.\n\nYes, I definitely think your sister and BIL are favoring boys over girls which is a terrible thing to do, but it does sadly happen. I had an uncle who had a daughter first and then 2 boys. He was so upset that his first born was not a son. He treated the boys extremely well but always yelled at, blamed and treated the girl terribly. My mom and her sisters noticed and would always take the girl out and buy her food and gifts. My uncle treated her so terribly that even her own brother noticed the blatant favorism and called him out for it, asking why he treated her so badly.", "Sucks to be them when you change your mind and uninvite them if the whole family can't make it.", "It\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s not as easy as just taking her out of her home - there\u2019s also a lot of guilt placed on her for leaving, backlash, being cut off from her siblings (her and I have had these conversations before). I don\u2019t want to make her life harder by getting involved, but I don\u2019t want them thinking this is acceptable either", "Thank you, and I\u2019m sorry to hear that you have experienced this as well. My family does the same, we try our best to look after the girls."]}
