I have hired an AirBnB beach house for Christmas close to my parents who are both retired, and we are staying for 5 nights. We are a very close knit family and spend Christmas trips together every year. While I have no kids, I am especially close to my sister\u2019s children. \n\nThe AirBnB booking is in my name, on my credit card. All was well, as all my sisters, their partners and kids were all coming and paying their share of the accommodation to me, and my parents are already excited about seeing us all at once. \n\nMy eldest niece who is 23, recently told me that her parents (my sister and BIL) told her she is not invited on the Christmas trip, she must stay home to mind their 4 cats, and to lie to the rest of the family to tell us she would prefer to work over Christmas instead. It was clear she was upset at being excluded from the Christmas trip, but she felt she couldn\u2019t go against her parents.\n\nI was upset that they would even consider her not coming, not to mention telling her she\u2019s not invited, and telling her to lie to us.\n\nI told her you are definitely invited, I\u2019m the one organizing it, there is room for you, and you shouldn\u2019t be staying home while everyone else is away at Christmas on a family trip.\n\nI asked can her parents pay for a cat hotel, my niece didn\u2019t think that they wanted to pay for it. I offered to talk to my sister about it, but my niece asked me not to, as she would get into trouble for telling me the truth. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t feel I can just let this go. \n\nI talked to my other sisters about it and I suggested I pay for the cat hotel to avoid confrontation. But they said no, that\u2019s not the right approach.\n\nSo my thoughts are that I speak to my sister on her own (against my niece\u2019s wishes), tell her that I would be really upset if my niece couldn\u2019t come for the Christmas trip, and ask if can they pay for the cat hotel for the 5 nights.\n\nIf she says no, then I will ask my sister if they can reduce their stay at the accommodation from 5 nights to 3 nights, and I will refund them the 2 nights of accommodation which covers the cat hotel for 3 nights.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance my sister and BIL will get really angry at me suggesting this, and say they are not coming at all. They also will be mad at my niece for telling me the truth. They might also say I\u2019m not her parent, and it\u2019s not up to me, which is true. \n\nSide note: Up until very recently I have paid for big ticket items and smaller items for my sister / her children as they were not in a good financial situation and I was earning more money. My sister has a husband and he works full time.\n\nWIBTA if I reduce my sister\u2019s stay at our Christmas AirBnB?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all your comments and suggestions - I\u2019m carefully considering it all over the next few days.", "created_utc": 1687258242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e7toa/wibta_if_i_reduce_my_sisters_stay_at_our/", "score": 275, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're cats.  I have two cats.  I can leave them at home for a week with their automatic feeders and extra disposable litter boxes.  My dog, however, I have to pay for boarding.

So that\u2019s why I feel like I have to confront them directly.\n\nAgree about helping her with moving out/therapy and we\u2019ve had discussions on both, and looked at accommodation options for her.

It\u2019s a don\u2019t rock the boat bullshit you see in families that allows this kind of insidious abuse to flourish. And make no mistake, there might not be physical abuse or bruises on your niece, but she has been & still being abused by her parents. It\u2019s time to stop worrying about the abusers\u2019 feelings. It\u2019s time for you & your other sister & your parents to say, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Your niece is an adult now but needs to hear everyone say what her parents have been doing is wrong & that you are all here for her now. Let her know she can walk out of that house today into a home of love & support. Her parents\u2019 behavior needs to be brought out loudly & openly.

Please rescue her.", "Personally I would take the niece and tell sister and bil to take care of their own cats\n\n\nNta", "the fact the sister told her daughter to lie shows she knows this is wrong.", "oh and tell your sister you are ashamed to have her as a sister. make it hear to her and everyone in the family: SHE IS A SHAME FOR THE HOLE FAMILY!", "Just jumping in here. I wonder if you couldn\u2019t pretend to your sister that your niece told you she wanted to work over the holidays (or however she was supposed to lie to you) and it\u2019s YOU who are really upset about it. And say that while niece kept up the lie, you think something else is going on. \n\nThen Maybe subtlety hint about telling your parents something is up. Basically, blackmail her into backing down from keeping niece home. This will maybe let you keep the peace for Christmas with everyone together. \n\nThen afterwards, you should probably do a family intervention or something. This is disturbing and damaging parental behaviour.", "Yes, this is along the lines of what I was thinking! My first instinct though was to keep going on and on about how excited you and your parents are to have the WHOLE FAMILY together for Christmas. And I'd keep stressing that.\nThen I'd start talking about how I (or other family members, depending on relevance) am organising to have my pets looked after and try to ask in casual conversation what their plans for their pets are. I might even go so far as to say in a group chat \"oh hey, if any of you need help with funds for pet sitters or accommodation, let me know!\" \nIt sounds to me, from what OP has said, that the niece's parents would have absolutely zero qualms about throwing her under the bus. So I can't really imagine them worrying if OP is mad at her - and I can fully see them actually blaming the niece if OP actually did follow through and cancel. That kind of mental gymnastics are child's play for people like that.", "I love this idea\n\nProtects the niece, and her trust in OP, but also shows these parents how important having the WHOLE family there is.", "You\u2019re approaching this from a perspective of \u201cthe best way to take care of my niece is to stand up for her when she is afraid to speak up for herself.\u201d But as others are saying, she\u2019s the one that is going to have to deal with all of the fallout. Plus, she may no longer feel safe telling you things in the future if you don\u2019t take her wishes into account now. \n\nI would start with another conversation with your niece - reiterate that she is invited & wanted on this trip, & ask if she wants you to do anything to help ensure that she can come. If she still doesn\u2019t want you to take action, then you need to weigh whether doing this now will make it harder for you to be there for her in the future.", "NTA but why is the 23yo still putting up with this nonsense from the parents? She is a full on adult and should go on any vacation she wants and leave the nest. I read most of your comments and understand there are younger siblings that you\u2019re concerned are being abused. Call CPS! This tip toeing around sister and BIL isn\u2019t healthy and it doesn\u2019t seem to be working.", "Is your niece financially independent from her parents? If not, could you help her become financially independent from her parents, so she no longer has to tolerate their crappy treatment of her?", "NTA.. I would un-invite them and tell them to mind their own cats and only invite the niece", ">My eldest niece who is 23, recently told me that her parents (my sister and BIL) told her she is not invited the Christmas trip, she must stay home to mind their 4 cats, and to lie to the rest of the family to tell us she would prefer to work over Christmas instead. \n\n\nIf she is \"not invited\", why would she need to lie to you about not wanting to go? Your sister and her husband are not only royal A-Hs, they're not even good liars.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA. If they've already paid, give them their money back and let them know they are no longer welcome.", "Given that you're the one with responsibility for the Air B&B, I'd take it a step further and let your sister know that unless her 23 year old daughter comes, the accommodation for her and the rest of her family is no longer available.  \n\nYour sister already knows that what she's doing is wrong and that the family would disapprove or she wouldn't have ordered your niece to lie.\n\nAnd please try to help your niece get it together to move out of her parents' home, and to get into some good therapy that will help her learn to value herself and stand up for herself, even if it will make her parents angry at her (the prospect of which seems to frighten and upset her).\n\nAnyone else suspect that this young woman was emotionally abused and scapegoated so much when she was younger that all this seems normal to her, and parental anger is still very scary to her at 23?\n\nDon't tolerate your sister's bullshit.  You niece comes or your sister isn't invited.  IMHO, reducing her stay isn't a loud enough message, but it's definitely the right message, so NTA.", "Agreed NTA here. The the whole \u201cwatching the cats\u201d excuse sounds a little fishy tho. I feel like there something more at play here. I have a friend with a few cats, and she regularly goes on 2-3 day trips where she leaves the food out for them and they feed themselves, have a littler box for them to do their stuff. I\u2019m a dog person, so when I found out that she did this I was shocked to hear how self reliant some cats can be. I think OPs suggestion to shorten their length of stay is spot on too.", "It sounds like they're punishing the daughter just for being alive. There is no need for her to stay with the cats. And there's probably no need for a cat hotel. Surely, there are friends or neighbors that would be willing to come in and feed and play with the little beasts, and scoop out their boxes. I do it for friends all the time.", "They've gotten lots of things their older sister hasn't, because their parents withhold from her to give to them. But you could also contact your younger niece and nephew and let them know that you're paying for all three kids, but not for any adults, this year, and that you hope they'll be able to come. Let their parents be the ones to explain why they can't go on a free vacation because their parents took advantage of their sister.", "This. AND. It's probably not about the cats. They're likely using the cats as an excuse to exclude her. If OP solves the cat problem they will likely try to find another reason to isolate her from family and support networks.", "NTA \n\nBut since there could be fallout for your niece with the direct approach, I would start hinting very heavily about family togetherness during the holidays.\nPut the societal pressure on her parents, who will not likely budge for their daughter but will for their image if they think they are being judged.\n\n \n>Up until very recently I have paid for big ticket items and smaller items for my sister\n\nor if the purse strings were tightening", "NTA.  Help your niece get out, stop giving any financial help to your sister, and help your niece get out and set up.   \n    \nThen let your sister know that you know what she did, that you find it vile, and that she is not welcome to share your AirBnB, refund her, and offer your niece a spot.", "NTA. Talk to your parents about it so they can properly scold your sister. It seems that's the only way she'll feel forced to let niece come. May I suggest you book a weekend off with only you and niece? From what I've gathered she's being treated like a house maid and expected to stay behind to take care of things. No child deserves that. So now that she's not a child anymore, you can take her wherever. Even if it makes your sister mad. I really feel for your niece.", "Are your parents aware of this dynamic in their daughter's house?", "NTA; your way of going around it might work, though I would bring it up with them by doing something like this:\n\nYou: hey, are all of the kids coming? I'm really looking forward to seeing them all and spening time with them\n\nThey might reply with something like \"no, eldest is staying home to 'work'\"\n\nYou: oh, that's a shame. what are you doing about the cats?\n\nThem: eldest is going to look after them\n\nYou: could she take a couple of days off work to come and you get the cats a cat hotel?\n\nThen maybe go on to tell them your idea. That way, you aren't going against their wishes, but are also \\*hopefully\\* getting your niece to come. Hope this helps!", "My future MIL did the same thing for years to my fianc\u00e9! Only for them it was because they had 4 cats and 3 dogs to for him to take care of. Now she wonders why we don't have much to do with her. I wouldn't be surprided if OP's niece goes LC in the future", "Have the parents stay home with the cats and invite her separately. Tell her to lie to her parents about where she's going for those five days, LOL. (I'm kidding. Kinda.)", "She\u2019s not financially independent yet, she has a couple more years of studying and works in a fast food place, but she\u2019s a good saver", "Yes my parents are aware. But there was an intervention of sorts some years ago and the result was our family being cut off from our nieces, so my parents don\u2019t want to be cut off from their grandchildren again", "That\u2019s pretty gross, you should have a litter tray per cat plus an extra one and even then they\u2019re supposed to be scooped daily at a bare minimum. We check/scoop all of ours at least 3 times a day and then if we see they\u2019ve been as we\u2019re walking past we do it again in between. I have no idea how people are so cool with having boxes of literal shit just hanging out in their houses. I bet they don\u2019t flush their toilet once every 3 days.", "This is the crap that causes that behavior", "Could she be financially independent if you helped her instead of paying for vacations for her awful parents?", "Wow, I feel bad that your family has to walk on eggshells around the sister and husband.\nWas she always this way?", "I didn\u2019t mean to portray my friend as some bad pet parent, but thanks for the assumption. My friend has one of those fancy self scooping liter boxes. If she\u2019s off on a trip for a week or more she usually has one of us keep her cats company by coming around her house every now and then and play with them; check on their water and food. The last time I did this, I laughed because I would be there everyday for hours and they would only play with me for a few minutes. I was house sitting more than anything, yet there was literally nothing to keep up with. They fed themselves, had their own water serving dispenser too, none of the mess/ up keep I expected, especially coming from me where I have a dog and there\u2019s way more upkeep. My point is, it\u2019s easier to travel and accommodate a cat.", "Sure okay but also the cats aren\u2019t humans and litter boxes arent toilets. Do you go around and flush each toilet once per day? Thats gross. In my house we flush after each use", "My financial situation right now is a lot tighter than it was, and financially I\u2019m on my own. I have helped with contributions but I can\u2019t afford to cover her rent, for example", "Was my sister always this way? No, she definitely wasn\u2019t. She has turned into her husband.", "It is absolutely easier to accommodate leaving a cat at home rather than a dog, but if they have a self-scooping litter tray that\u2019s kind of important information to leave out when talking about how long you can leave cats alone for. There are certainly a lot of people who scoop their single litter box once or twice a week and think that\u2019s just fine. I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable the parents don\u2019t want the cats left home alone, it\u2019s just it ought to be them making the sacrifice to stay home and watch them if they don\u2019t want to board them or hire a pet sitter (if they can get one), not them trying to call \u201cnot it\u201d and ruin their poor daughter\u2019s holiday.", "The family is not as \u201cclose knit\u201d as you say then. \n\nYou need to thoroughly explain to them how they are being shitty ppl."]}
