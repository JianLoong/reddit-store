We invited 300 people to our wedding as I have a huge family. So although that is a large number of guest, I still needed to choose very carefully who to invite/not. My grandma is particularly close with one of her sisters whom she lives with. I know my great aunt but not her children very well and haven\u2019t seen them in a few years. But, since they are my grandmas closest people I felt it was important to include my great aunt and her 5 children. Two of her kids are married so I invited those four as couples. Three of her children are divorced and have been single for years - these three did not get a plus one which their invite clearly states. \n\nTurns out, my oldest cousin (40y/o) asked my grandma if she could bring her boyfriend of two months to the wedding in place of her brother who wouldn\u2019t be attending. My grandma thought that would be fine and brought it up to me on a recent phone call. I thought of it as a bit rude to ask but I get shooting your shot just to see. I explained to my grandma that my fianc\u00e9 has not only not met my cousin in the 7 years we\u2019ve been together, let alone her new boyfriend. The wedding is expensive and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable paying for a stranger to attend and figured my cousin would understand. \n\nTurns out my cousin freaked out at my grandma and was sobbing over how rude it was that I won\u2019t let her boyfriend attend as her plus one. She\u2019s recently divorced and it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s felt happy in years. So my grandma calls my mom to ask if cousin can bring him as \u201cshe hates to make people cry.\u201d Without knowing I had already given a firm no, my mom says, \u201csure, why not.\u201d \n\nMy grandma then calls me and starts off the phone call with, \u201cplease don\u2019t be mad at me but\u2026\u201d and explains the situation. My grandma always tries to please everyone and she struggles with boundaries. I\u2019m used to this. I explained I wasn\u2019t mad at her but annoyed. I asked why my 40 year old cousin who I barely know would throw a tantrum over not having a plus one to my wedding, somebody she hardly knows. Grandma tried to explain that it\u2019s the first family function she gets to bring him to.. but Thanksgiving and Christmas are right around the corner so that\u2019s silly. Ultimately, I tell grandma that I already made a decision and cousin doesn\u2019t have a plus one. But now I don\u2019t even want my cousin to attend as this seems like very rude and childish behavior. I have since removed her name from the online RSVP that she hadn\u2019t yet responded to. I know this will cause problems and drama for my sweet grandma which is what I was trying to avoid by inviting my great aunt and her kids in the first place..\n\nEdit: she\u2019s still invited but no plus one. I thought saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry grandma but that won\u2019t work, I\u2019m not comfortable with her inviting strangers without my permission\u201d would have been the end of it. It\u2019s just silly from there. Maybe if she had come to me from the start, it would have been different. Lesson learned. If she shows up with him, she shows up with him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. It\u2019s been fun hearing everyone\u2019s opinions.

I considered refusing - it was *my* wedding, pretty small, and expensive per head. But in the end I thought about what I really wanted which was 1) to be surrounded by people who love me and I love and 2) to bring our families together. And I realized that 3 people I don\u2019t know that well wouldn\u2019t make any difference to 1), but in the uncle\u2019s eyes the lack of those people would ruin 2), and no amount of my being in the right would change that. And from a cost perspective it would add like 0.8% to the cost of the wedding. So I invited the freaking second cousins, didn\u2019t have to think about or talk about them in the run up to the wedding so I could focus on the fun.

I was pretty frustrated and pissed. But I decided to let it go and was able to just forget about it and focus on other things. You are having a 300 person wedding and are putting so much energy on 1 person. This is bringing so much negativity and frustration to your wedding planning. If I were you, I'd just let her bring him and get back to happier planning.

No this take a first date to a wedding would make me cancel the date I don\u2019t need the anxiety of making small take with strangers.", "That's crazy & a lot of pressure on new couples. What if the cousin caught the bouquet? There would be (most likely) people saying she & new(-ish) boyfriend are next to get married; that's potential for a fight & a breakup.", "So?  Still not seeing how that entitles her to force her wishes on OP.", "*First* date at a wedding?! That seems so crazy to me. How awkward if it goes badly. The opposite of a casual coffee", "It's funny how all these lovely people pleasers, are always happy to f*ck over the actual nice people. \n\n\"Oh I know this is a special day that's meant to be all about you, but I chose to screw you over so I didn't have to deal with your ah cousin\"", "That's not uninviting. You need to actually have some form of interaction between you and this cousin.", "You need to affirmatively uninvite her.  Don't be weird and passive aggressive and triangulate people like your grandma did.", "Make sure yiu actually tell them she's not invited anymore or they can assume it's a glitch and just show up", "[removed]", "I think she wants him there to get the idea of marriage into his head. She's probably hoping that he would see himself walking down the aisle with her soon. That's why she's so upset, \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude0a you just blew her scheme. No wonder she had a tantrum. Girl thinks she can hook him at your wedding, but that's not how it works. I could be wrong \ud83d\ude07. Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials.", "I wholeheartedly agree with this one. \n\nI will also say that not everyone is going to show, especially with a guest list this large. Even some people who RSVP \"yes\" will be no shows. It happens. Life happens. Illness, family emergencies, flat tires, work obligations, couple squabbles etc, all mean at least a few will change their mind at the last minute. Which means you'll probably have room and left over meals anyway, so it won't cost extra to have the plus one. \n\nAnd with this many guests, if you even have a one sentence greeting with the cousin and BF, it'll be over quickly and you probably won't see them again the entire night.", "I agree. He's taking the place of someone else (so it's not like the OP has to pay extra or anything). And in a wedding of 300 people you'll probably see them for about a minute whilst they congratulate you and you won't see them for the rest of the night. \n\n\nThe OP is NTA but I think it's one of those situations where you have to think \"is it really worth it?\". Is it really worth uninviting the cousin - and having to endure all the drama that comes with that vs inviting her and keeping your Grandma and everyone happy.", "I\u2019m kind of wondering why gram even wanted great aunt\u2019s children there - they\u2019re not likely to be close to OP as a first cousin, once removed, and it\u2019s not like great aunt was a mother of four children who couldn\u2019t find a baby sitter. And if I were great aunt, I wouldn\u2019t care about having my adult children at the wedding of my great niece. It\u2019s like expecting your 40yo daughter to be invited to a coworker\u2019s wedding with you.", "Exactly.  Grandma is at the hub of all the drama but, we need to make her feel special.", "I really don't understand this take. Why invite people you are \"excited\" to see won't be coming? \n\nMy daughter was invited to a wedding abroad, and she is planning on going. I'll be traveling with her, but she didn't get a plus 1 so she'll attend alone. I thought it was odd, but I hadn't considered that the bride would prefer she not come at all.", "I get why you'd be excited to cut the guest list but you set yourself up for problems with your choices. Giving plus ones to some and not others will leave a bad taste in many peoples' mouths. It seems like you are judging the quality/closeness of  their relationships, which isn't your place.\n\nYour options were to not invite any of the distant relatives or suck it up and invite them all with plus ones. Doing what you did was the worst of both worlds: expensive and causes offense/problems for Gma. \n\nPassive aggressively uninviting her is even worse and makes you a full blown asshole.", "It doesn't really, that money was already in your budget. \n\nI'll probably be downvoted for this, because your cousin is an AH, but if you genuinely want to minimise drama for your grandma - not just at your wedding, but probably at any family event she has to attend with that side of the family in the future - I would be the bigger person, add the cousin back on the invite and allow her a plus one instead of the brother who can't attend. But also make it *very clear* to your grandma and that side of the family that that's it, the wedding is full now, no more plus ones or swaps.\n\nWe were pushed by my FIL to invite a couple to our wedding, who had had a recent tragic loss. Our venue was small with limited numbers (and we were paying for the wedding ourselves so as far as I was concerned it was overstepping by my FIL) so I was annoyed initially, but calmed down when I considered it wasn't a massive amount of money to keep the in-laws happy, and we did have enough space. The couple ended up having a good time, and it *was* a nice thing to do.", "Yup. It\u2019s tacky and rude. But looking at how this type of behavior has been trending the last many years it\u2019s not too surprising.", "You could teach a master class in passive-aggressive behavior \ud83d\ude44", "Lots of people these days only give plus ones to married couples or those in longterm relationships.", "I'm kinda hung up on the 300 people thing personally. Like, I don't even know 300 people. Maybe I'm just too introverted, but good lord, that's more people than I need around me. And if you've got 300 people, at that point it kind of feels like it doesn't matter if someone brought a plus one. I get it for the sake of seating and food and stuff, but you're also not likely to even see the person, along with so many others. I'm probably just too casual, but I'd likely just say BYOB and sure.", "It\u2019s totally normal to invite only those who are married or in long term relationships.  Plus ones can seriously increase the cost, effect your venue, mean you can\u2019t invite people you are actually close to, etc.", "Weddings are exorbintantly expensive. Each guest can cost upwards of $100. Limiting plus ones bc of this is very normal practice now.", "Tell her directly and explain that regardless of what your grandmother or your mother says, neither has the authority to approve her or anyone else bringing uninvited guests.", "Explain that she\u2019s not the only one invited who has a boyfriend who\u2019s not invited and if you include hers it means 10 more people because you\u2019ll have to invite more cousins girl/boyfriends who you\u2019ve never met. Or you\u2019ll have other cousins pissed at you.  Rock meet hard place.", "She already factored in and budgeted for a cousin she doesn't know who will not be attending, so what's the difference if the unknown new boyfriend attends in his place? It will make her grandmother happy, which OP claims is all she wants to do, and was the reason for these family members being invited in the first place.  \n\nShe should do it for grandma, not the 40-year-old toddler, get it?   The EQ on Reddit is very low.", "Oh, well lmao she can deal, then. She's just entitled and using her divorce as an excuse well beyond its expiration date.", "Doesn\u2019t want her boyfriend to walk down the aisle with someone else, and doesn\u2019t want him to dance with someone else if there will be a dance where members of the wedding party partner each other.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "In my country you leave a monetary gift to a wedding which for a couple right now sums up around a monthly minimum wage.

Imagine all the available, unattached people he will meet.  Hook-up city!!", "For sure. It was petty. I put her name back on. Still no plus one.", "This is good advice.", "Yes, the cousin might just show up with the bf.", "Yes. Don't wait for them to rsvp online and find out they can't. Tell them now because you will likely have others drop in solidarity. And tell your Grandma because she will catch hell for this.", "100% second that!", "Oof, it\u2019s *extra* shitty to invite someone to a destination wedding (or one where that guest will have to travel to attend) and not offer a plus one!", "Majority of the people invited we are super excited about. But some of the invites are more of an obligation - such as distant family that aren\u2019t particularly important to the bride and groom but are important to somebody who is important to the bride and groom. We could have said no, but we wanted to be kind and extend the invites to who we were comfortable with. If they can come, that\u2019s great. If not, it\u2019s cheaper. But requesting to bring strangers as uninvited plus ones just doesn\u2019t feel cool. Especially if you can\u2019t approach and ask the couple directly. \n\nYou\u2019ve never had a creepy Uncle Ed and a mean Aunt Sharon you hoped wouldn\u2019t show up to an event?", "Disagree. Inviting a cousin *and their spouse* is not a plus one situation. Committed couples get invited as a unit, which it sounds like OP did, for that section of the family at least.", "You\u2019ve put this much more eloquently than I did in my other comments. \n\nSimilarly we had 3 people at our small wedding that were just there to placate family, and I\u2019ve never regretted it. It would have been so much drama to hold the line, and likely would have created ill will that might have tainted the exact thing that mattered the most about my wedding - the feeling of two families and groups of friends coming together to celebrate our union.", "If your excited for someone to decline, then don\u2019t invite them. I understand that your grandma is special to you. But it\u2019s YOUR day. You should be inviting people YOU know or want to be there.", "Appreciate this. We were advised to budget for 30% of people to not show - we always knew all 300 wouldn\u2019t attend and budgeted accordingly. With that said, it was petty to remove her name and I have since added it back. Still no plus one. I doubt she or her siblings will come - i kind of always thought they would likely decline as I figured they had better things to do seeing as we don\u2019t know each other very well. Shot myself in the foot a bit for sure.", "To a lot of people there is a difference between inviting an unknown family member to make another family member happy vs inviting an unknown stranger to coddle a tantrum-throwing family member that they don't know, so that another family member won't feel bad. \n\nAnd honestly, entitled people get that way because people cave to them over and over again because it's 'easier'.", "This was it exactly. She didn\u2019t want him escorting my maid of honor down the aisle. We didn\u2019t have any dance numbers or even assigned seating, so it was just thirty seconds of him walking next to another woman. It was ridiculous.", "Our Best Man went through a brutal divorce months before our ceremony. He brought a relatively random girl as his date, who he had no serious intentions with.\n\nLiterally did not care. We wanted him to be happy and carefree. He was.", "My culture does that as well. At the very minimum you do a cash gift that covers the cost of you being there. It goes up depending on your relationship to the bride and/or groom.", "I was always forced to stand in with the single girls. I either dodged the bouquet or treated it like a hot potato.", "Yeah, you can dodge it. I did that at my sister's wedding, lol.", "You should still uninvite her, just do it as an adult.

She doesn\u2019t care about your boundaries. NTA", "The situation doesn\u2019t make YTA but the way you handle this uninvited will eventually.

Both of you are being complete fucking assholes to your grandma.", "OP you HAVE to come back with an update after the wedding! I am willing to bet $100 that if she rsvp\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d she\u2019s bringing the boyfriend.", "I thought so. I wonder if they made a sad face when she rsvp'ed yes? \ud83d\ude06", "I guess not.", "Nah, I understand OP, but I think this is more the mindset of people to whom weddings are family events, not just a commemoration for the bride and groom. \n\nMy wedding had only 10 or so good friends attend - the rest of the extensive guestlist was filled with our giant extended family (to keep my grandma happy) and a plane\u2019s worth of childhood friends of my mother\u2019s (to keep my mother happy). 20 people I\u2019ve never seen before, who wouldn\u2019t know me from Adam, but we shelled out the money because this wedding was more about our family than us, lol.", "Listen, I don't think you're exactly TA here, but this is really more a problem with your grandmother, whom you're trying to make happy, and your mom, who went behind your back. Both of them told cousin she could bring her bf in place of her brother. I realize that YOU should have been the final answer, but that's not what happened here.\n\nCan you extend a little empathy for this cousin? She's recently divorced, probably doesn't want to attend a happy wedding alone, is getting new feelers for her new life, and two people already told her that she could bring him. So she probably feels a little pulled back and forth. \n\nI am not saying she is absolutely in the right here, but do you really want this to be the hill you die on regarding your wedding? One plate, that your mom and grandmother kind of threw you under the bus for? \n\nNTA, but you either need to clearly communicate she is uninvited and why, which is going to make your grandmother feel bad and might start drama because your mom kind of stirred the hornets nest here, or just let this one slide.", "30%, wow! I don't envy you the logistics of that. We kept our net tight for guests, partially due to Covid and partially because I would have preferred to elope but himself wanted the white wedding \ud83d\ude05 but big weddings are good fun though, hope this all works itself out and you have a great day \ud83d\ude0a", "I disagree in this case.  I think the cousin is tacky as hell.  But I don't see this as a cousin issue, I see it as a Grandma issue. \n\nOP's post says it all, her grandmother is often overlooked and excluded, so OP made a special point of including family members closest to Grandma. This was kind and considerate of OP.\n\nSo now one of those family members is causing a ruckus because she wants her boyfriend to go.  She went to Grandma to intervene on her behalf, which she did but OP shot her down, and now OP wants to uninvite the cousin as well.  \n\nWho is going to deal with the repercussions of this?  Not OP, Grandma is!  She lives with the cousin's mother!  Her grandmother may be a pushover but I doubt this incident is going to change how Grandma has acted her whole life.\n\nOP will never have a close relationship with this cousin or see her often, so \"holding her accountable\" to stop the behavior is really not an issue.  It may be \"wrong\" to indulge the cousin, but is it wrong to indulge Grandma?   \n\nThis means something to Grandma and to those closest to her. I think OP should continue to extend kindness and consideration to her grandmother, and let the obnoxious cousin and her new boyfriend attend. With 300 people attending, will these 2 really make a difference to OP when she already budgeted for their number to attend? That's how I look at this.", "Yeah big difference between ur best man and a very distant cousin", "Grandma put herself in the middle after she got a firm no from OP then went behind her back and asked OP\u2019s mom instead, knowing OP had already said no.", "Grandma did it herself. She even went out of her way to ask OPs mom instead after OP said no. Grandma really not that sweet.", "I agree with you. Going to a wedding can be scary, the fact that she was recently divorced is really significant IMO. If I was OP I would make my mom cover that plate for saying yes without approval \ud83d\ude05", "OP doesn't know the circumstances of the divorce, maybe said cousin was cheating. \n\nShe needed to ask the bride and/or groom about bringing an extra guest.", "Thank you! \u263a\ufe0f", "My point was to explain why it's likely different for OP. And Grandma is only bearing the repercussions of her inability to say no, so... She brought this on herself. 'Indulging Grandma' also subtly gives Grandma a pass to keep doing stuff like this. \n\nAt the very least Op should only let the cousin attend on her own and 100% not cave on the plus one.", "Especially when he likely had rsvped with a yes before the divorce or at least got a plus one with his invitation"]}
