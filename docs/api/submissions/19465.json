The only justification I can think of for the cruelty is that she upset your partner, although your ends could still have been accomplished without the cruelty. The only downside would have been that she might try repeating this stunt, but the way to prevent that would have been to tell your parents that your household is not fallback childcare for your sister.

Bravo!", "yeah no kidding, all these fucking neckbeard basement dwelling fucks saying you should put a kid in the system because their mom dropped them off at a responsible babysitters house but didn't exactly have permission... \n\nholy shit, it makes literally no sense.", "By the time CPS even shows up she\u2019d probably be back", "I had one friendship with a narcissist, and it was truly enough drama for a LIFETIME. Bore me to tears, life. I\u2019ll find my way.", "Nah, the made up posts need to be absurd. Like the OOP who called herself \"Grocery\". That's the troll energy I need in my life", "Ha. We live 4,099 miles from our family.", "That's why Grey's Anatomy was my thing for years!!", ">a lil 2007 cringe to just, like, decompress???\n\nMTV dating shows from that era are what I watched lmao", "This is why I used to read the Rag Mags (National Enquirer). Sometimes all you need is a little junk food for the mind.", "I got a wild hair a couple months ago and watched some Bridezillas lmao. The pure overgrown teenage angst! \ud83d\ude02"]}
