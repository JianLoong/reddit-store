Yes, it sucks and is harder but she made her life decisions and isn't entitled to just dump her kids on whomever whenever she feels like it.\n\nYour wife and family are your priority.  Your sister isn't.\n\nWhy didn't your sister just leave the kids with your parents?  at the house where she is living?", "NTA\n\nThere needs to be an option for \"You were, but it's ok\".

You guys are not her free babysitters, especially unannounced and for a breakup. If this was an emergency, then it would be different.\n\nThe only thing you should\u2019ve done differently is leave the kids out of it. You basically called them mistakes right in front of them. \n\nIt sounds like your mom is a big part of this issue. She\u2019s enabling your sister and that\u2019s why she\u2019s like this.

NTA in my opinion.", "NTA. Her kids, her responsibility.

That's why this is ESH. The fact that your wife was busy made it worse, but frankly, even if you were both home, with no plans, it would still be incredibly rude of your sister to simply drop the kids off like that.\n\nNow, unfortunately, because of your ugliness, she will overlook the fact that she was being rude and will simply focus on the fact that you were mean to her.\n\nSo, ESH.", "ESH, obviously your sister shouldn't have done that but claiming that nothing she will ever do in her life will be as important as your wife's school is an absolutely horrible sentiment that I hope you don't actually believe is true.", "Everyone here saying NTA WTFFF \ud83e\udd2f like ESH! \n\nYour sister is the asshole because as a parent you can\u2019t just drop your kids off with people without consent.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely the asshole for calling her kids a mistake AND saying nothing she ever does in her life will be as important as your wife going to school. \n\nWow!

It suggests that you don't care about your sister or anything that matters to her, that as far as you're concerned, she is an insignificant nothing who can never live up to your saintly wife. \n\nI'm going to go with an ESH, purely because of that wording. If it had been something like \"my wife needs to focus on her education, she doesn't have the time to be nanny right now, grow up and be responsible for your offspring\" then it would have been a flat NTA. Your sister was definitely in the wrong for dumping her kids like that, and for refusing to take \"no\" for an answer, and probably does deserve a good hard reality check from time to time.

This cruelty sounds like it comes from a deeper disapproval of her life.\n\nThe only justifying/mitigating variable I can think of is that she'll probably be too scared to dump her kids with your wife again. The only justification I can think of for the cruelty is that she upset your partner, although your ends could still have been accomplished without the cruelty. The only downside would have been that she might try repeating this stunt, but the way to prevent that would have been to tell your parents that your household is not fallback childcare for your sister. Short-term, you could also get a door camera and let your wife know not to answer the door for your sister if she shows up unannounced.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
