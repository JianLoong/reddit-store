The only justification I can think of for the cruelty is that she upset your partner, although your ends could still have been accomplished without the cruelty. The only downside would have been that she might try repeating this stunt, but the way to prevent that would have been to tell your parents that your household is not fallback childcare for your sister.

And yes, his wife\u2019s schooling is very important indeed, but that was no reason to say his sister being a parent wasn\u2019t important either. \n\n  Even when you\u2019re NOT single, parents get help w their kids ALL the time from other people, even other family. Should they \u201craise their kids on their own\u201d too? Or is that different cuz they\u2019re not single parents and didn\u2019t make the \u201cmistakes\u201d of having children? He shouldn\u2019t have had to judge her being a single parent, especially if he isn\u2019t one and wouldn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like tbh \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I get his frustration, but acting like she does that everyday and neglects her children regularly based on the sole fact of her doing this twice is kinda overreacting tbh. Nothing wrong with being a single parent bro. Downvote me if you want but i 100% think they\u2019re both in the wrong and should apologize to each other as well as set some clear boundaries instead of just letting it happen and blowing up when it happens again.", "I thought of it as lancing a boil lol Like, I knew watching a show  *because* it pissed me off, *because* it triggered similar feelings I'd grown up with, was probably a bit unhealthy. But I took my irrational anger out on the Kardashians instead of my kids. And bonus! There are endless amounts of people who actually want to hear your thoughts and opinions on any celebrity. There are approximately -1 people who want to hear about how awful my mommy was (cuz honestly I'm tired of hearing about it too lmfao) So honestly that helped. \n\nAnd omg, I just realized I used the Kardashians as makeshift therapy because the US health care system is abysmal. What even is this place?? \ud83d\ude02", "Considering the math on contraceptive failure, no you do not have enough data.", "Absolutely this. It's not his responsibility to keep his sister's children out of the system. And one call to CPS because his sister left her kids with him or his wife without their okay isn't going to get the kids taken unless there's way bigger problems at play. She'll get ordered parenting classes at worst if this is the only problem.\n\n Plus, having a social worker involved could be beneficial for the kids and her. Having a social worker involved can get her access to free or reduced cost childcare if she needs it. CPS can help her get child support from the father(s) if she's not already getting it. \n\n>they\u2019d almost rather a kid die with their biological parent(s) than put &/or keep a kid in the system.\n\nYeah, because it costs the government a hell of a lot more to put a kid in foster care than to leave them with their parents.", "Well, yeah. I can mentally backflip and decide to misinterpret things as well.", "Based on the context, Think most of us are reading this as \u201cnothing you do or have going on will ever take priority over my wife trying to better herself in hers or my life\u201d.  As for the second point, having a kid you can\u2019t support is irresponsible but hey stuff happens. Having ANOTHER when you\u2019re already struggling to take care of the first one is just being stupid.", "Lmao! Idk how the fuck what I said was a \u201cmental backflip\u201d but ok. I guess that\u2019s why you\u2019ll never be important in your family\u2019s life either"]}
