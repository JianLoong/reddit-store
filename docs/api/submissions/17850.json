You are not appreciated. Congrats on the job!", "You\u2019re sister is being ridiculous and should have asked someone else. The interview determines whether you get your dream job and in turn your future. She should support and encourage you. Not dismiss it and leave her kids with you so they could go on a date. Which can be on any other day.", "Sorry you're dealing with this. Good luck with the job! \ud83d\ude42", "Do you have a link lol?\n\nIs your mum expected to look after the kids now, I can't see any other reason why she doesn't want you to pursue your future.", "That makes it sound even faker", "\ud83d\ude02 my sister and my mother send me angry messages cause they have seen it", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I just don\u2019t get how people can say it\u2019s fake when they don\u2019t even know me", "Same tbh \ud83d\ude02", "Thank you :)", "Thank you!

You are NTA, your future is more important than \"date night.\"  I really believe your sister was trying to keep you free to babysit by sabotaging your interview.", "Congrats!!!! Sadly, expect the cold shoulder from your family. They\u2019ll hold a grudge that \u201csee? You could have rescheduled, and I bet you still would have got the job!\u201d Or \u201cthat stupid job you shouldn\u2019t have even interviewed for. It takes away time from your family. Your niece/nephew miss you. Don\u2019t you want to spend time with them?! BTW, request next weekend off so hubby and I can take a weekend trip. We need you to watch the kids.\u201d", "Congrats! I think the kiddos that you babysit will be happy to hear your good news! Especially if you make them some popcorn or something.", "Most excellent news!", "What??? I'm sorry!! I've dealt with this dynamic before, it sucks. I just don't get people. It's time to cut them off and live your best life!! \n\nCongrats on your new job!! You have a bright new future ahead!!", "That's awesome. Never allow anyone, including your family, to dictate your life. Period.", "Yup :)", "Thank you so much \ud83d\ude0a", "Sounds like we're missing some very important context doesn't it?", "Good! Keep it that way, I think a little break from them is a good idea and it\u2019ll give you some time to figure out better boundaries going into the future. Family can get tricky as we get older and start establishing our own careers, priorities and identities separate from our families. Congratulations on the job! You are doing fantastic!"]}
