What did she expect you to do when it came to finances since she doesnt pay you? Just because you are related does not mean they are the stars of your life.

Your niceness should not be exploited.", "She is taking advantage of you! Please stop babysitting! You need to stop letting her walk all over you.", "It sounds ridiculous than anyone would wonder if they were an AH for not cancelling a job interview to babysit so your sister can have a date night. Of course you\u2019re NTA for that and the fact that you have cancelled your own plans previously to babysit is even more ridiculous. How could you possibly be an AH for prioritizing a JOB over your selfish sister\u2019s want for a night out? The fact that you even have to ask makes it seem fake bc no one is this \u2026 naive. Either you\u2019re this much of a doormat or this is fake.", "Thanks :)", "I felt like I was because none of my family is talking to me due to this situation so I want to see if I was the asshole or not :)", "No more cancelling your own stuff for them unless it's an absolute emergency!
