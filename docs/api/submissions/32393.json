And Aiden is also \"my own son\". I have the right to bring him to my house as his father. For those who're gleefully saying that they hope Rachel divorces me: I'd rather have Aiden in my house than to live with Rachel (or Lia) without him. I am rich, and I can make my own path &  find another wife if I want to. Absolutely nothing justifies calling her mother a \"whore\" like Lia did. Using that language absolutely blames him, his mother, and is ostracism. Also, yes, Rachel also called her mother a whore, not just Lia. I forgot to mention that.\n\nAnd yes, it is my house. It's theirs as well, but not legally. I own it.\n\nYes, I gave them time to process it, I did not bring Aiden in all of a sudden. Just to clarify.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nMy wife Rachel (35 F) and I (35 M) have been married for many years now, and I also have a daughter Lia (14 F). I am not proud to admit it, but I had another child while I was married to Rachel through another relationship. That's Aiden (12 M).\n\nI kept it as a secret from them, and I paid child support to her mother. I was meeting absolutely all of their expenses. She herself had a good job anyway. She passed away recently, and Aiden was alone.\n\nI did not want my son to suffer like that, without any parents. The reason I did not reveal his identity to Rachel and Lia is that I did not want to cause a fight, but now I had no choice. I went through all the proper procedures to get custody of Aiden. I made him live in my house.\n\nMy wife and Lia did not take it well. They went absolutely ballistic when they learned about him, and Rachel screamed about how I shouldn't even dare to think of letting him take even a step inside. Lia was saying the same stuff. But I did not back down, and they eventually had to be fine with the decision.\n\nThey have been absolutely livid about it, and Rachel has been demanding to get Aiden away from the house. I told her that I am not going to do that, and warned her against doing anything to him. Lia got mad and asked me whether I value \"someone who was born out of a whore\", and I lost my temper. I got up and asked them to \"get the fuck out of my house\" if they do not want to reside with Aiden. In the end Rachel was crying and they're not talking to me now.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701797605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bhd0o/aita_for_asking_my_wife_and_daughter_to_leave_the/", "score": 2290, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At every step, you took the asshole move. \n\nIt's okay if you're committed to being a parent to Aiden - it's good that you're taking responsibility for once for your actions.

Because you made unilateral decisions, but people can still react to them emotionally - if you think you get to make decisions without emotional consequences, you are in for a very bad time with everyone whose life you've callously played with for your desires. This is not a good environment for Aiden either, unless everyone is okay with it.\n\nIn the end, you destroyed both of your families through your unilateral decision-making and still ended up providing an unsafe environment for your son, as well as torpedoing the relationship with your wife and daughter.

Depending on how much he paid out over 12 years, he might just be forfeiting the house to the wife, anyway.", "As well as she may be owed part of the value of \u201chis\u201d house.", "Not all states have alimony or community property, but barring a prenup, equitable distribution and child support are pretty likely outcomes in most states.", "Twenty says if Aiden were a girl, OP would've kept his trap shut and quietly moved the kid in with grandma.", "Probably got one now, which is why he's so blas\u00e9 about replacing his wife.", "And yet he feels no guilt or remorse. There\u2019s zero accountability in his entire post.", "Personally, I'm not willing to offer any judgement on Aiden's mother here. We don't know what she knew, or what she thought she was participating in.", "I work in family law and my guess is he also fought for the kid, and tool the kid away from family of the mother who probably already loved him. I would go as far as to say he even would have been better in a foster home, not with OP. Now he has to live the rest of his teenage years dealing with OP and OP\u2019s extreme selfishness. Imagine how he is going to feel watching the revolving door of new wives after OP\u2019s money. And OP is even more of an idiot if he thinks that\u2019s his house .", "Nah im betting the kid knew him and that he was still seeing the mom that died and thats why he is so offended over the daughter calling her names.", "And imagine how little it would take for good old dad to drop me again, if he can drop his wife and daughter and pick me up, he could drop me again in a heartbeat. That does nothing for a child\u2019s sense of security.", "Bingo!!", "> bought the house before marriage\n\nhas literally anything changed about the house since then? especially including the value?   \n\n\nBoom, marital gains", "It sounds like he assumed Rachel would just accept this and not rock the boat. He has the money so, naturally, he has the power. I hope Rachel takes him to the cleaners...and that OP is ready to lose any relationship with his daughter...who is also an innocent bystander.", "That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. He went to bat so hardcore for a kid he hardly knows, but just throws away his marriage, his wife daughter over basically nothing. Because they DARED be upset by some very devastating news. So much so, \u201che\u2019ll just get a new wife.\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s some kind of sociopath who tosses people away for the smallest offense, okay, but does that mean he\u2019s hidden that aspect of himself as well? Let\u2019s so he is, and he has. Why the other child now? \n\nThe inconsistency is making me think this is fake as hell. It\u2019s rage bait if I had to guess.", "OP sounds like a sociopath.", "Yeah, this wasn\u2019t a one time mistake 12 years ago. OP was hiding a whole ass other family, and it came crumbling down when the other woman passed away.", "When I said \u201cacknowledge\u201d I meant acknowledge publicly as in he was hiding the son. So, yes, the son knew him but like was still hidden from everyone as a shameful secret.", "So you lied and hid a child from a mistress for 12 years amd expect them to be totally ok with not just the affair and their being a child but that that child will now be living with them? Yeah YTA.", "My god, dude, how can you not be the asshole in this situation? You cheated on your wife and kicked her and your other kid out of your house. YT gaping A", "Wow, you get have emotions but your wife and daughter do not? Grow up dude, YTA.", "I\u2019d kill to hear Aiden\u2019s version of this story", "\u201cNothing justifies calling calling a Mother a whore\u201d\u2026..of course not.  And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to hang onto that one because you got her now! How dare she right?! Because in a justifiable moment of anger she said something she shouldn\u2019t of. I mean **Surprise! Here\u2019s my love child from an affair I had while married to you!\u201d How dare she call  the woman who knew you were married and slept with you anyway a whore? Your self righteous indignation is rich! All of a signed you now have a moral compass? \n\nYou know what else isn\u2019t justifiable? That you\u2019ve just glossed over? Having a affair, and another child a secret for 12 years going behind your wife and other child\u2019s back and obtaining custody and just plopping him into the middle of your house without consulting your current wife and child.   \n\nIt\u2019s good that your wife found out and they glaringly obvious way how it\u2019s your way or the highway right now. Otherwise it would\u2019ve been years of her figuring out that you control the situation because \u201cyou\u2019re rich \u201cand it\u2019s \u201cyour house\u201d", "Oh hon LEGALLY you are married and your wife gets half that house. Gonna guess she\u2019s a SAHM doing all the invisible unpaid labour while you \u201cmake the money\u201d. YTA for cheating, lying for 12 years, forcing this news and entire life change on your kid and wife\u2026 then saying \u201cI can find another wife\u201d. You clearly think women are disposable and replaceable.  And it shows.", "Your house? Lmao not for long dude \n\nGood luck bro you\u2019re about to get fucked by the divorce court but you\u2019ll get to keep full custody of your son that probably fucking hates your guts because you literally fucking his mom and paid her off and ignored his existence for 12 years in favor of your real family.\n\nYTA YTA YTA have fun dying sad broke and alone jackass", "\"I can find another wife if I want to\" \n\nGod you're disgusting. YTA. 100% you're an asshole and you know you're an asshole. I hope she gets half of everything at a minimum when she leaves your ass", "YTA. \"Your house\"?\n\nI mean, I don't care for what Lia's said about Aiden as it is not Aiden's fault, but YOU OP, created ALL OF THIS.\n\nAfter the divorce, you & Aiden may need to find a new place to live.........it may not be \"your house\" for long..........", "YTA just for the edits alone. Yikes.", "This dude really is showing no remorse for his actions. I hope his wife divorces him and takes him for everything he has.\nYTA.", "1st, I don't believe this is real, but if it is, good luck convincing the judge that the house you and your wife have been sharing for 15 years is all yours.  No matter how rich you claim to be.", "OG post = YTA\n\nTo the edit = Y a huge AH", "Well said. But op cheated. I hope the wife leaves him. \n\nI hope the best for the innocent children.", "Yes this! Omg. \u201c I\u2019m rich, I can get a new wife if I want?\u201d Any woman who marries him  now WOULD be a prostitute since money is the only reason someone would marry him", "I still don't understand what the draw for karma is other than clout. Personally I am indifferent to the number, and can't say I feel any pride about my karma numbers. No one outside of reddit is even aware that I post(well my husband knows, sorta.  I have told him, but he cares about reddit about as much as op cares about his wife)."]}
