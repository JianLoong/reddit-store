So she asks me if I'd agree to a custody modification so she could have both boys. To add insult to injury, she also asked that I PAY her legal fees because it has to go through family court.\n\nI told her she had a lot of nerve to ask such a thing from me. The answer is hell no. That was weeks ago and she's even more hostile towards me when we have to interact.\n\nOn Monday, she dropped our son off at school and I was there to see him before he went to class. That's been the norm for both of us. \n\nAfter our son went to class. She started yelling at me over my refusing to let her dictate our custody agreement. I told her that she's not worth talking to and walked out of the school. She followed me to my car still yelling at waving her hands. \n\nOn Wednesday, she was informed that she was banned from our son's school for the rest of the year for yelling and cursing on school grounds. She asked for a reconsideration and the principal said he'd have to talk to other people.\n\nMy ex then asked me to ask the principal to \"unban\" her. I said \"do you have anything else to say? She said no. I said I'm not getting involved. This is between you and the school.
