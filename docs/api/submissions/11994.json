My ex and I don't really get along and it's mostly on her. She's just a mean, nasty, lying, evil person. If she were just nice, then we'd get along. \n\nRight now we're fighting over custody scheduling. She has a 5yo son who she shares custody with her ex boyfriend. Their custody schedule was settled by a judge and she has custody pretty much on days I have custody of our 9yo. She wanted to have them on the same day.\n\nShe didn't try to work things out with him and it backfired on her hahaha. So she asks me if I'd agree to a custody modification so she could have both boys. To add insult to injury, she also asked that I PAY her legal fees because it has to go through family court.\n\nI told her she had a lot of nerve to ask such a thing from me. The answer is hell no. That was weeks ago and she's even more hostile towards me when we have to interact.\n\nOn Monday, she dropped our son off at school and I was there to see him before he went to class. That's been the norm for both of us. \n\nAfter our son went to class. She started yelling at me over my refusing to let her dictate our custody agreement. I told her that she's not worth talking to and walked out of the school. She followed me to my car still yelling at waving her hands. \n\nOn Wednesday, she was informed that she was banned from our son's school for the rest of the year for yelling and cursing on school grounds. She asked for a reconsideration and the principal said he'd have to talk to other people.\n\nMy ex then asked me to ask the principal to \"unban\" her. I said \"do you have anything else to say? She said no. I said I'm not getting involved. This is between you and the school. Next time try apologizing before asking for a favor from someone you mistreat.\n\nThe principal did reach out to me and I gave him my side and said this is between you and my ex. So the ban is still in effect.\n\nEdit: For people saying that I should give my ex what she wants at my expense because I should \"think of the children!\" are lame. My ex was only thinking of herself when she tried to get full custody of her 5yo. \n\nShe forced a war with her ex by going for full custody. She wouldn't budge and that is why the judge created the custody schedule which ended up being unfavorable to my ex. \n\nI don't need my ex for my son to have a relationship with his half brother. I'm cool with him and we're both open to letting them spend time together when we have custody.", "created_utc": 1678503301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11o8v3t/aita_for_refusing_to_ask_that_my_sons_mom_be/", "score": 2774, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
