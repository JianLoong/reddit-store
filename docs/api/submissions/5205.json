I'm divorced and have 2 teenage kids with my ex wife, 17M and 14F. \n\nMy whole family came to my and my GF's appartment last Saturday for my birthday party: my parents, some aunts and uncles, some cousins, my 3 brothers with their families, my two kids (and my GF's 15yro son who lives with us). \n\nI am a recovered alcoholic, I've been sober for 6 years now. Alcohol absolutely ruined my life, it destroyed my marriage and nuked my relationship with my kids for years. I don't allow alcohol in my home now, for anyone. It just isn't served or tolerated here. My entire family knows this very well, as they know my entire history with alcohol. \n\nFor my 40th, my brother bought me a very expensive bottle of whiskey, it had writing on it, a very heavy bottle and very old whiskey, so it probably cost him a couple hundred bucks. \n\nWhen he gave me the bottle, I was shocked, and said I don't drink, but thanks for the gift. He then opened the bottle and started pouring shots in plastic cups for everyone. My daughter had a panic attack at the smell of the alcohol (which I am painfully aware is my fault and I will never forgive myself for it), so I told my brother to take the alcohol out on the balcony and just leave it there. He wouldn't do it, and took a shot of the whiskey. \n\nI told him to seriously stop it and he proceeded to pour the whiskey. He then said I am acting like a sober saint now, when I ruined everyone's birthdays for years with my drinking. I told him to come to the hallway with me and talk it out. He refused and put a glass of whiskey in my hand. \n\nI took the trash can, threw the whiskey bottle in it and the plastic cups, and took the trash out. \n\nMy brother then stormed off and my mom followed him. She later called me, demanding an apology for disrespecting my brother like that. My dad said I was being overly sensitive, and some of my other family members also agree. \n\nAita here?", "created_utc": 1671551026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqro4j/aita_for_throwing_away_the_expensive_whiskey_my/", "score": 486, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Possibly the worst gift I\u2019ve ever heard of someone giving another, especially as he is aware of your struggles and recovery. . Congratulations on recovery and standing up for yourself and your family.", "NTA, your brother clearly has some lingering resentment and issues about your past but instead of talking to you about it like an adult, he chose the pettiest, most passive agressive, and most inappropiate way to adress it. You don't do that shit in front of the whole family and specially not the kids, who as you said, suffered enough already. Your brother is an asshole and your family is insane for supporting that behavior.", "NTA. your mother rang up and scolded the wrong son, she is an AH and so is the rest of that family. i\u2018m sorry you and your kids had to go through such an awful event. \n\ncongrats on your 6years and for doing the right thing by handling the situation appropriately. and a happy belated birthday.", "Reading the whole story through I am amazed how you kept your cool.

Your family is crazy, and your brother is abhorrent. He's the one who openly disrespected you, and the rest of your family can kick rocks.\n\nYou owe no apologies. You actually owe them NOTHING (including any explanation or reply). \n\nCongratulations on six years!!! I swear it keeps getting better. Ok, life keeps happening, but I keep getting better...I'm proud of you.", "NTA. What a malicious thing to do to you. He obviously doesn\u2019t respect you or your sobriety. Those that agree with you having to apologize also have zero respect for you. At least you know who supports you and who doesn\u2019t, and go LC. \n\nCongratulations on your 6 years of sobriety!", "NTA.\n\nHe was entirely rude and insulting to your choices and sobriety. Do not allow him back to your home", "This is a literal example of \u201cmy house, my rules.\u201d What the fuck was your brother thinking/trying to do?

Or, you know, both.", "NTA x10000000\n\nYour brother was completely wrong and he got what he deserve.  Please don't apologize because you did nothing wrong.", "NTA - This is grossly insensitive of your brother. Congrats on your sobriety and keep up the good work!", "NTA, run from this. My dad was sober for 10 years before his mom convinced him to have just one drink at new years. Fuck that. It wasn't just one drink.", "NTA- good for you for not giving in or letting it slide.\n\nWhat he did is 100% justifiable to go no contact with him until he makes thing right. Anyone who is on his side I would also no NC with. It\u2019s going to take more than a apology from him to fix your relationship.", "WOW! Alcoholism is no joke. I am just baffled by your family's response to your brother.  I mean is he the 'golden child' or something? Like WTF. \n\n100% NTA", "NTA.  It's bad enough that your brother pulled that stunt, but in \\*your\\* home?  Nah, nah.  Your brother is a huge asshole.  He has zero respect for \\*very\\* reasonable boundaries.  Same goes for your mother.  Sounds like the apple didn't fall far from the tree.", "NTA. Your brother is the one being extremely disrespectful. Proud of you for working so hard and for standing up for yourself, OP. Well done.", "recovering here, (21 yrs) \u2026 first, I applaud your sobriety, for those that truly don\u2019t understand, there may be nothing harder.

After decades clean and sober, I\u2019m not sure I could have acted with such restraint, (nah, I\u2019m sure \u2026 I would not have). \n\nditch the AH, go LC with mom until she grasps what you are doing. Unfortunately it takes a lot for some to \u201cget it\u201d. In my life it was the alcohol death of a family member to open eyes to my struggle. \n\nBe strong \u2026 I got you. You are so strongly NTA that I hesitate to even mention.", "I can\u2019t believe your whole family is taking brother\u2019s side here.

Giving alcohol to an alcoholic is a dick move. Anyone that thinks what he did was appropriate in any way needs to be ghosted. Family or not.", "NTA. WTF did I just read? You're sober, and fought hard to be, and your brother tried to sabotage your sobriety and your birthday?! And your mom wants YOU to apologize? What the...", "NTA. If there's anyone who's an asshole here, it will be your brother. Alcohol addiction is not a joke. If they want to drink, they should've done it on their OWN birthday party. This kind of family member makes me vomit.", "NTA, addiction is a disease that you managed to beat. You stood up for yourself beautifully and set your boundaries before taking the extreme option, which was still pretty mild in my opinion, I would have thrown the whiskey in his face. You have nothing to apologize for, your brother should apologize.", "NTA. Your brother is, though.\n\nAs someone with a brother who struggles with alcoholism, I cannot even fathom bringing alcohol into his house, let alone insult him over his sobriety. I applaud anyone who is strong enough to stay sober in these sorts of situations. If people can't see that you're doing what's best for you and your immediate family, that's their problem.\n\nHuge congrats on staying sober for 6 years!", "Nta. Your brothers gesture obviously came from a place of anger, resentment, and sabotage.", "OMG. You are sooooo NTA but your family is. \n\nI was married to an alcoholic (now deceased due to alcoholism) and there are so many people who sabotaged his sobriety. \n\nPeople do that with anyone who is trying to improve themselves. Dieting? Just one bite won't hurt! Sober? Oh, so you're a Saint now... Want to go to college and have a career? Oh, you're too good for us now.\n\nThey are feeling judged and projecting their emotions onto you. It's not your fault. Take care of your family. Continue to make amends but never apologize for getting well.", "NTA. This is horrific. Your brother acted shamefully and your mother's response is incomprehensible.", "NTA.\n\nThis reminds me of the families of multiple people I know: the moment someone makes progress toward escaping a bad situation, they all do their damndest to drag that person down to keep them from escaping. The old \"what, do you think you're better than us?,\" or as it's also known, \"crab mentality.\"", "NTA. He disrespected your rule of no alcohol in your home, pretended whiskey was an appropriate gift for a recovered alcoholic, refused to go out onto the balcony, refused to talk to you in the hall about it... your brother is a real piece of work.", "Absolutely NTA. Your brother has no respect for you or what you\u2019ve gone through. You did a good job at enforcing your boundaries. Your brothers actions actually make me really angry and I find them inexcusable. Your parents are straight up wrong for defending your brother and expecting you to apologize to him. You don\u2019t owe him an apology by any means. Continue looking out for yourself - you are doing great!", "NTA. \n\nYou're sober, but it seems like your brother still sees a drunk. He might want to go check out a local AlAnon group.", "Holy sh*t. Your family does not support you. Absolutely NTA. Good luck on this journey, it is not an easy one, but it is worthwhile.", "NTA. \n\nYour house, your rules. If people have a problem with that rule, they don\u2019t have to attend. \n\nPlus, it was YOUR whiskey. He gave it to you. So you were allowed to decide what to do with it.", "OMG, no. NTA. That was so insensitive to you and your very clear boundaries.", "NTA your brother is a dick and you should have smashed the damn bottle over his head", "NTA\n\nYour house, your rules. A good brother would be receptive to your request and respectful of your troubled past with alcohol. He sounds like he did all of this spitefully instead of accidentally. You had every right to trash the whiskey and you don't owe him jack. The rest of your family doesn't take your sobriety as seriously as you do, which is their choice, but they need to respect you and your home.", "Wow NTA \n\nHowever this is a strong sign to tell you that he has NOT forgiven you for how you was whilst being an alcoholic. I don't know if you have a sponsor or mentor who may be able to help you resolve this grudge your brother has once things have capmed down?", "NTA, but wow....your brother sure is. I would NEVER imagine doing something like that to someone who was recovering. This was unacceptable on so many levels, especially when he put a glass in YOUR hand. \nThis was NOT you being \"overly sensitive\" this was your brother choosing to make a scene and not respect your choices or boundaries, in your own home none the less, because he wanted to be petty. \nPlease OP, I hope you know you did nothing wrong in this situation and should not feel guilty for any of it. You tried to de escalate the situation by offering to step outside and talk. HE'S the one who forced the issue.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is actively trying to sabotage you and the progress you made. Do yourself a favor. Cut ties with him and anyone on his side. They'll do you more harm than good if they stay in your life. \n\nCongrats on being 6 years sober. I hope you have a long happy life of sobriety.", "NTA, your family is now no longer welcome in your home.", "NTA. Your brother, however, was.", "NTA. There\u2019s so much solid advice in the comments, all I have to add is be proud of yourself. You fucked up, you have done the hard work to try and be in a better place and a better person. Hope your daughter is ok.", "NTA your brother wanted to either get back at you for past behavior when you were drunk, or destroy your sobriety. You asked him to take it outside and he kept on. Good for you for throwing it away.", "NTA - what your brother did was incredibly disrespectful of your boundaries and your sobriety.  Just by giving you a gift that he knew you wouldn't like was a massive AH move.  Congrats to you on maintaining your sobriety.", "What the actual fuck?\n\nNTA\n\nYou do not put a glass of alcohol in an alcoholic's hand.\n\nClearly, your brother has not forgiven you, and you can't force him to, any more than he can force you to drink.", "NTA you may have hurt them when you were a alcoholic they are not expected to forgive you and in their right to resent you and even cut contact. What they are not allowed is to retaliate and try to derail your life. Think it's best to go low contact with your brother and parents. Keep to holiday wishes over the phone for the next few years at the very least.", "Read the title and thought \"YTA\", then read your story and that shifted to a hard NTA at all. Sorry your brother was behaving like an AH, good on you for setting the boundary and sticking to it. It's not your fault your family doesn't seem to understand how serious this is.", "Jesus Christ. NTA! Your brother most definitely is and I'm shocked to hear your parents sided with him. I'm angry for you and would have done the same. That's so disrespectful, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that when you're doing so well. You don't need that kind of person in your life.", "NTA. That guy is bad news. I know he is your brother but he is a dangerous person who was clearly out to sabotage you. Be careful, OP.", "NTA he could have made you fall off the wagon and put you into a deadly spiral.", "NTA\n\nThat whiskey was never supposed to be a present, it was payback for you ruining other family members birthday's while you were still drinking. He did it deliberately to upset you and ruin your birthday. There is clearly still lingering resentment towards you, but involving your kids and pulling a stunt like that was an AH move by your brother.", "NTA, and that is completely horrible of your brother.  I am so sorry your family is so unsupportive of your recovery.  It may be time to go LC for a while to get your mindset straight again.\n\nI have friends who are also recovering.  I won't even buy Black Cherry Merlot scented hand sanitizer from Bath and Bodyworks as a gift for them.", "NTA.\n\nIf your family insists that you deserve this type of treatment because of your past behavior, ask them what your daughter did to deserve being traumatized.\n\nSounds like you aren\u2019t the only family member who\u2019s an alcoholic. \n\nCongratulations on your recovery - six years sober is a huge accomplishment.", "NTA.\nIs he one of the reasons you started drinking? What an entitled lemon crusted tea stain of a wet fart.\nHe might be angry at you for your past, but clearly being an asshole is part of his personality.\nHe knew exactly what he was doing and he had full intention to hurt you.", "NTA in the slightest. WTF is wrong with your brother and his mom? You were beyond reasonable, and your brother was trying to undermine you. \n\nHas he done anything like this before?", "NTA\n\nYour brother, on the other side... yikes! You know him better than us, but right now I can't think of a single reason to give such an obnoxious, cruel gift to you. And I can't believe that someone took his side.\n\nFor how painful it is, it looks like it's time for you to evaluate if going lc/nc with them.  \nI wish you the best for your recovery.", "You are not the asshole, and I am exceptionally proud of you. NTA", "Definitely NTA, but your family that doesn't seem to understand that it's irresponsible to bring alcohol around a recovering person are. It seems that bro was trying to make a point but he f'ed around and found out. Good for you OP!", "NTA. Sounds like your brother is a struggling alcoholic himself and your sobriety is something he\u2019s trying to sabotage. I don\u2019t know why your mom is taking his side. Has he always been a golden child?", "You are SO NTA. There was a clear boundary which was trampled so many ways-\n\n1. He brought the bottle\n\n2. He didn't immediately realise his mistake and apologise when you pointed out you don't drink\n\n3. He doubled down when your child began to cry\n\n4. He insulted your sobriety when you stood up for your child\n\n5. He placed an alcoholic drink in the hands of an addict in recovery\n\n6. He made it all about him when you didn't violate your sobriety, presumably just for his entertainment.\n\n7. He tried to use the previous deleterious effects of your addiction on your family as a JUSTIFICATION for his boundary trampling\n\n8. He ran to your mother to get the flying monkeys to work at breaking down your resolve and attacking you for your zero-tolerance stance.\n\nYour brother is a prick. Good on you for remaining strong in the face of that bullying. I know that Reddit is often quick to suggest a scorched earth policy, but this guy showed up with a premeditated plan to make you back into the person you were when you were drinking. If I were you, I'd give serious thought to the future of your relationship with your brother and mother- just how much support and positivity are you getting from them, when counted against this kind of vicious psychological warfare?\n\n\nAlso, it's 100% not the point... But if the retort comes that it was an expensive gift and you should have been grateful in principle if not in practice (ie/ it's the thought that counts, don't make a fuss etc), then you can point out the use of cheap plastic cups (practically a cardinal sin for any properly nice alcoholic beverage) and the fact that he chose to distribute the gift, which he had ostensibly given to you, to others, against your will and in spite of your protestations- that's a planned attack, which both intrinsically devalued the gift, and **much** more importantly, devalued the importance of your wants and needs in your own home, seeking to override a firmly established boundary that applies to your whole home. Fuck that guy, he sounds like he has no respect for you or your wellbeing, and he may plan to use the price against you, so be prepared to retaliate.", "NTA - did you call your sponsor?\n\n6 years is no joke - but I\u2019ve seen more people break down between 5-10 than any other span. \n\nTake this seriously for your sobriety sake and make sure you talk to someone in your circle about it. \n\nCongratulations on your hard work.", "SOOOOO NTA.\n\nThis is not something that affects you but also your kids! You became superman and kicked it, for yourself but also your family.\n\nI would tell your mother to not call you again unless SHE has an apology for you and your brother needs to apologize to you. he did not get you whiskey for YOUR birthday, he got it for himself and then to try and kick you off the wagon. If they cared for you they would respect you AND your kids. They obviously do not so I suggest going VERY low contact with them for your own sake.", "NTA - That was insanely disrespectful of your brother. It sounds like your daughter could do a lot to educate your brother and parents on who was in the right here. Let your daughter tear your brother and parents a new one then take her out for dinner to celebrate. You did right by her and no doubt she'll have your back, and that's all that matters.", "NTA. While I know it\u2019s hard to understand, it\u2019s probably some sort of cathartic payback for your brother to ruin an event for you. I don\u2019t know what the full history is here, nor what it was like to be around you when you were drinking, but in his own way, he was probably expressing his anger for wrongs he perceives you\u2019ve committed due to your drinking. \n\nI would wholeheartedly suggest allowing things to simmer down, but not for too long, and try have a conversation about how his actions made you feel. It\u2019s often too hard for us to see reason or the other side in the heat of the moment, but on later reflection, it tends to be a little easier. Talk to him, talk it out and whatever the outcome, you will both probably feel a little better, though I cannot guarantee it", "NTA, your brother is terribly rude", "Very obviously NTA. Who gives such a messed up gift to someone who is recovering???", "NTA everyone knows your history and nobody thinks that your brother trying to get you to drink is an issue? Family are a bunch of A H\n\nAlso good for you for throwing the bottle away. If it were me I would have broken it with my brother's head.", "NTA. I stopped drinking, not because I had any issues with it, just kinda slowly began to distance myself from it because I realized it could easily become a habit and a crutch. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve experienced since then with my family members has bugged me to no end. I seemingly get shamed at gatherings if I don\u2019t want to have a shot or a glass of wine. I still drink on occasion, but I don\u2019t understand why people have an issue if someone doesn\u2019t want to drink. I\u2019m a stoner now and I don\u2019t get pushy with people who don\u2019t wanna smoke with me. \n\nAdd to the fact that you\u2019ve had a tumultuous relationship, to say the least, with alcohol and yet your family seems to think that the poor behavior came from you. So tone deaf on your family\u2019s part. Alcohol is a legal drug that tears families apart, can bring the worst out in people, and kills sooo many innocent people everyday. \n\nAgain, NTA OP, the fact that your family doesn\u2019t see how insensitive, hurtful your brothers actions were is sad, I\u2019m sorry for that man. You even handled the matter with class, asking for it to be brought on the balcony even though it being in your home was very against what you wanted", "NTA\n\n.. and I'm impressed with how you handed it.\n\nNow, I might be paranoid, but wonder if your brother is subconsciously, o consciously, trying to boycott your progress. He mentioned your past, maybe he doesnt like that now he cant say you are the one ruining everything, the one whose marriage was broken, the black sheep etc and now his flaws are much more obvious. Maybe he is jealous he doesnt get to play the saint and good brother/son any more, bc you fixed your problem.\n\nOr maybe he is just d\\*mb enough to not realize what you went through.... and maybe he lives in a cave and thinks alcoholism is a phase.\n\nI don't understand your mom and rest of family. And I start to believe that their praise of alcohol is what lead you to your issues (apart from your own choices of course). They have to be extremelly \\*\\*\\* to think a bottle of whiskey is a great gift for a recovering alcoholic.\n\nI wish alcohol were not so commonly accepted, even encouraged, at celebrations.", "NTA\n\nJust assuming here but it's possible that you might have ruined a few meetings because of your drinking and so this was your brother's way of getting revenge. Even so, you should not feel guilty of how you handled the situation.\n\nNo matter what his reasons were, his childish actions caused your daughter to have a panic attack, something that he either completely ignored or he simply didn't care about her. I'm also going to assume that your brother is an adult even though he isn't acting like one which only makes this whole situation even worse.\n\nYou tried to diffuse the situation multiple times and even offered to do so out of view from anybody else.\n\nAny member of the family that are calling you overly sensitive and saying you were in the wrong are the AHs in this situation.", "NTA. Don't contact with your brother for a while.", "You've come a long way, and this internet stranger is very proud of you for putting yourself and your children first. NTA", "Your brother is an absolute piece of s***. If I were you I would be done with him he doesn't respect you or you sobriety the fact that he brought the whiskey to your apartment during your birthday party is insane and then proceeded to act like an a****** the whole time.\n\nNTA, but your brother def is.", "Wtf!! NTA. Your brother is TA for sure and so are your family members who defend him.", "NTA.  He brings a gift of alcohol to someone he *knows* is a former alcoholic and does everything short of physically pouring it down your throat to get ypu to drink it.", "How in the hell could you be the AH here. NTA\n\nYour brother was not only disrespectful to you, he also tried to get you back into alcohol and ruin your life. What the heck?", "It is an extremely unthoughtful gift for a recovering alcohol. Does your brother hate you?\n\nYour brother has displayed some very toxic behaviour and clearly does not understand how hard it is to remain sober and not give into temptation.\n\n>He then said I am acting like a sober saint now, when I ruined everyone's birthdays for years with my drinking. I told him to come to the hallway with me and talk it out. He refused and put a glass of whiskey in my hand. \n\nThis here seems like he purposely wants to set you up for failure and fishing around for a sense of weakness but clearly you didn't take his bait. Your parents and extended family seem to enable your brother's behaviour. Is this because of your past behaviour when you were drunk and they feel somehow this is justified?\n\nThey need to be in the receiving end of a serious chat about alcoholism, the consequences and the support needed because they're not taking you seriously.", "Your brother is a major AH and your parents are acting fucking trashy and AH like themselves.  NTA and more importantly congratulations on the sobriety. Keep it up, you\u2019re doung great!", "NTA\n\nFirst, congratulations on your recovery!  It's not easy. \n\nYour family knows you're in recovery.  Do they not understand that 6 days or 6 years, you'll always be in recovery?  What your brother did to you was mean-spirited, lacking empathy, short-sighted and selfish and your family deciding it's *you* being sensitive rather than *him* being insensitive needs to be addressed.  Full stop. There's no gray area in this matter and you're well within your right to throw your brother out with the whiskey should he ever do this again.", "Your brother was lashing out at you for all the years your fucked up birthdays...he wanted to fuck up yours...you need therapy with him to hash out all that anger", "NTA but your brother sure is and then some. What a malicious and cruel thing to do to someone and their family.", "NTA, you weren\u2019t disrespecting, your brother and your brother was disrespecting you, your daughter, and your home and your rules, there is no way that you are the a H", "I feel like you\u2019re living in the Twilight Zone! Your brother and parents cannot possibly think this is ok behavior! Your family completely sucks! Definitely NTA", "NTA - But this will not be the last time they try this unfortunately.  \nKeep your wits about you because it seems they are trying to reintroduce you to alcohol", "NTA - you don't owe ANYONE an apology for responding the way you did this time. He disrespected you, your house, your recovery, your GF and your daughter and everything you are trying to make amends for in recovery by bringing alcohol into a no alcohol household. He's lucky you didn't kick him out at any point from when you saw the alcohol on.\n\nAnyone who thinks you owe an apology to your brother for this owes you, your GF and daughter all MASSIVE apologies before they should be allowed back in your house if not your life.\n\nI am sorry about what happened, and hope you are able to retain your sobriety, you achieved a lot staying sober, just the act of staying sober is an accomplishment.", "Definitely NTA! I\u2019m sorry your brother is so intolerant. You are doing the right thing for yourself and your family. Your brother, on the other hand, is a huge asshole.", "NTA. I am sorry to inform you you're related to some grade A disrespectful idiots. So you ruined everyone's birthdays for years with your addiction is his reason for trying to make you go back to that addiction. I know a few people who have the same addiction I am guessing you do not need him to tell you that you messed up when you were drinking that is why you have the no alcohol around you/your daughter rule. Putting a drink in to an alcoholics hand recovered or not is not only stupid it is dangerous.", "NTA - but the rest of your family is, especially your brother and mother. \n\n... but can I ask why you felt the need to put your step child in brackets? It has no relevance, I'm just curious. Feels like a deliberate separation, and I was curious about why he was the only one.", "NTA - your brother knew EXACTLY what he was doing and that was both being an AH and trying to sabotage your sobriety.  \n\nIf your family continues to take your brothers side, no matter what harm or disappointment you caused them in the past, go low or no contact.  Your sobriety and your children are more important that that kind of ish.", "NTA he didn't get that whiskey for you", "Either your brother is trying to sabotage your recovery. \n\nOR\n\nHe is seeking revenge fur years of drunken behaviour.  Either way this was not a gift. \n\nHe should be apologising to you for incident he caused,  not the other way around.", "NTA Your brother is a major ah and so is your family for siding with him", "NTA\nYour brother is, very much so. Let me say this as somebody who wishes that her mother had half your spine: In proud of you and how you reacted", "Omg NO!!! You disrespected him??? Our society has advanced enough to understand Alcoholism and how it is a disease. Does your extended family live under a rock?

If your parents/sibling whomever cannot understand the hurdles you've overcome and the victories you've toiled to achieve to rebuild your life and help sustain your core family in health and safety, my suggestion is to go NC.

I'm divorced and have 2 teenage kids with my ex wife, 17M and 14F. \n\nMy whole family came to my and my GF's appartment last Saturday for my birthday party: my parents, some aunts and uncles, some cousins, my 3 brothers with their families, my two kids (and my GF's 15yro son who lives with us). \n\nI am a recovered alcoholic, I've been sober for 6 years now. Alcohol absolutely ruined my life, it destroyed my marriage and nuked my relationship with my kids for years. I don't allow alcohol in my home now, for anyone. It just isn't served or tolerated here. My entire family knows this very well, as they know my entire history with alcohol. \n\nFor my 40th, my brother bought me a very expensive bottle of whiskey, it had writing on it, a very heavy bottle and very old whiskey, so it probably cost him a couple hundred bucks. \n\nWhen he gave me the bottle, I was shocked, and said I don't drink, but thanks for the gift. He then opened the bottle and started pouring shots in plastic cups for everyone. My daughter had a panic attack at the smell of the alcohol (which I am painfully aware is my fault and I will never forgive myself for it), so I told my brother to take the alcohol out on the balcony and just leave it there. He wouldn't do it, and took a shot of the whiskey. \n\nI told him to seriously stop it and he proceeded to pour the whiskey. He then said I am acting like a sober saint now, when I ruined everyone's birthdays for years with my drinking. I told him to come to the hallway with me and talk it out. He refused and put a glass of whiskey in my hand. \n\nI took the trash can, threw the whiskey bottle in it and the plastic cups, and took the trash out. \n\nMy brother then stormed off and my mom followed him. She later called me, demanding an apology for disrespecting my brother like that. My dad said I was being overly sensitive, and some of my other family members also agree. \n\nAita here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

People formerly in my life (for other reasons) would constantly criticize me for not drinking the \"right amount\".\n\nNo, I don't enjoy throwing up, but thanks for your pointless judgment.", "First, congratulations on your sobriety!\n\nAs a recovering addict (meth was my drug of choice, but I tried everything except heroin) you need to make boundaries to help resist the urges. Not wanting alcohol in your own home is totally reasonable. I am 23 years sober and will not go near family that I know indulges socially.\n\nWhat your brother did was completely out of line. He is allowed to be upset you ruined family functions in the past and he allowed to not forgive you, but that means he shouldn't have come. What he did was vindictive and cruel; not only to you, but also to your children who obviously still have trauma to work thru from your alcohol days.\n\nI personally would cut him and your mother out of your life if they expect an apology from you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, \n\nGood for you on staying strong and standing your ground ! \n\nThe rest of them are clearly assholes, allowing your brother to poor that whiskey, even allowing him to gift you that.

Of that, there can be no doubt.", "> He then said I am acting like a sober saint now, when I ruined everyone's birthdays for years with my drinking.\n\nSo his rationale for getting you to drink, is an open acknowledgement of how you ruined past events with drinking?

I'm sure there are some unresolved issues w/ your past dinking and your brother/parents. Sounds like you did some pretty horrendous things when drinking and your brother still being angry at you/not forgiving you is actually OK and a normal feeling. Acting out whatever anger he has at you in the worst way possible and trying to take innocent victims down with you is not OK. \n\nThis sounds like payback, like he wanted to ruin an event and make everyone uncomfortable and scare the kids like you did so many times, like he wanted you to see it and feel it. \n\nI could be wrong about all of this, but if that is the case, you should apologize - not for pouring out the alcohol, but apologize again for putting your family through so much pain and acknowledge that you understand they are still feeling it. Follow that up w/ letting him know that although his anger and hurt may be justified, his actions were not. He re-traumatized your kids and if he had thought about what they went through instead of just his own anger, he would realize just how awful what he did really was. He should apologize to your kids for his display. Also let him know that he doesn't have to forgive you and you would understand if he didn't. Let him know you will be taking a step back from family events for a bit and hope, for your kids sake, you both can come to a place where you can politely be in the same room together for family events in the future. If not, you will both discuss boundries like adults and work things out so that an incident like this never happens again.\n\nIf you had a close relationship w/ your brother when you were younger and you feel.like he might be open to it, suggest going to family counseling together.\n\nThen sit down w/ your parents and have the same discussion. Let them know you want to give your brother breathing room and that you don't want them pressuring him into \"forgiveness\" or acting like \"one big happy family\". His anger is real and justified. It takes a long time to heal from the destruction alcoholism does to a family. Pretending that everything is OK is not the way to heal the family.", "NTA your brother was so disrespectful, and the fact your family members don\u2019t consider your relationship with alcohol just shows the don\u2019t understand the degree to which it ruined your life and your relationship with your kids.

Then, on the other end, there\u2019s the ol\u2019 YOU DO DRINK?! HOW DARE YOU RUIN MY LIFE WITH WHAT YOU DO ON YOUR OWN TIME! You have a legitimate reason that you need to not drink, which makes it exponentially worse that he\u2019s decided this is the hill to die on, somehow. Even if you weren\u2019t a recovering alcoholic, forcing someone into it, in their own home, is so not okay.

You may owe some apologies for past behavior and incidents but you absolutely do not owe your brother for your actions at your 40th. I would be curious to see if you mom felt you owed brother an apology if you were a recovering heroin addict and he gifted you some syringes filled with uncut heroin.

In what world would this be ok? None. Cut off everyone who didn't help you stop this scene. They care more about feeling inferior to your sobriety, by seeing it as a personal attack to them. They don't support you and actively just traumatized your kidd. They are the snakes in the grass.", "\"acting like a sober saint\" \n\nFrom his little stunt and this comment I would say that your brother is probably threatened by your sobriety and most likely has a drinking problem himself.

I may have a couple of decades of recovery under my belt (\"class of 2000\") but that level of disrespect sure would have brought out some old fire. That level of taunting is a matter of life and death to me, and probably would have been met with that level of intensity...", "As the mother's response typically is on this subreddit.", "Yea, OP took away their power to look down on him, so now brother is spending hundreds of dollars to get brother to throw it all away. There was no way for OP to win: either he drinks and goes back on sobriety, or he throws it away and is an asshole. And the brother did this on OP's *birthday!* That family is toxic as fuck.", "Brother is totally disrespectful. I would have put him on his ass if were my brother. \nYou handled it well. Stay strong", "Then the title would read \"AITA for killing my brother with a whiskey bottle.\" Those things are solid", "His whole family honestly. NTA", "Literally my thoughts", "Same. I was fully ready to judge for wasting it but i got to 'recovering alcoholic' and my mouth dropped open at the brother's horrendous gift.  \n\nDefinitely NTA", "This! He clearly disrespected you and your home. As adults, he and your parents should know better. They all owe you the apology, not the other way around. And for fucks sake, who puts whiskey in the hand of someone recovering?!?", "Definitely going to use that line someday \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "All of this, plus: congrats on your sobriety OP. You are doing good - for yourself and for your kids.", "Your points 1) and 2) aren't mistakes at all.  The brother did that on purpose.", "I did, and went for a meeting later that evening. \n\nMy kids chose to sleep over at my place though. Which, after all these years, feels better than any birthday gift I could have gotten.", "Brother is not rude, he is a AH, op NTA.", "And him and the mom not seeing the pain that was caused by their actions, the poor teenage daughter probably had to relive some traumatic memories.", "An alcoholic in denial.  Along with the rest of the family.\n\nThis was deliberate.  The tea totaler spoils their fun.", "Think OP's separating the family that's visiting vs the family that lives with them. GF was already mentioned at \"GF's apartment\".", "His GF's kid. Not his step anything. They are not married.", "Or the brother and mom are alcoholics and see OPs recovery as a slight against them.", "I get this response all the time. I don\u2019t enjoy being drunk. I will gladly hang out with people who are, and I\u2019m happy that they\u2019re having fun, but it\u2019s really weird how some people will act like you personally insulted their mother and kicked their dog if you don\u2019t drink.", "I was wondering the same thing, it doesn't seem like we're getting it all here? Was there some bad blood between OP and the brother maybe? It's not hard to assume that's the case given the alcoholism but yeah, defo not enough info here OP", "The steps are part a specific program,  but aren't required to be sober.\n\nWhile people should definitely apologize for being an asshole,  being an asshole to force an apology makes one an asshole.\n\nAnd petty antics like that displayed by the brother pretty much ensure there will be no apology.", "That in no way excuses the brothers actions here. OP is NTA in this situation regardless.", "I don\u2019t care if OP slept with the brothers wife while he was drunk on the brothers birthday. \n\nHe was still an asshole and gave his niece, an innocent teenager, a panic attack with his shenanigans.", "I was wondering the same. Not that it excuses the brother's behavior in any way. Don't come to the party if you are so resentful.", "Why would that matter, in this case?", "I don't think..there's any amount of background info that warrants wanting to get back at someone who was in active addiction and ruining a whole event for it.", "I think you meant to say NTA here by reading your comments.", "I think you mean NTA", "You put YTA instead of NTA FYI", "I think you meant NTA... Everything else you said is on point.", "Edit your judgement maybe?", "You mean NTA!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It\u2019s basically a miracle OP is safely in recovery with that kind of support system. Kudos to OP.", "This was my reaction. I read this entire post with my jaw hanging open. Who in the world would back the brother\u2019s behavior? At best, his behavior was cruel\u2014at worst, it was massively abusive. OP, you are obviously NTA and I\u2019m so sorry your family reacts to your recovery and setting of healthy boundaries with abuse and denial. I\u2019d go NC honestly.", ">He'd be banned from fun forever\n\n\nwoooooooooooosh. its like everyone glossed over that one glaring line telling OP he was getting a taste of his own medicine...", "Apology or not, purposely giving someone a spiteful gift that could lead to a deadly path is unforgivable. OP asked his brother if they could talk it out and instead he tried to break his brother\u2019s sobriety. It makes zero sense and is not an appropriate way to get an apology or whatever brother feels entitled to. He also scared his niece and perpetuated the trauma. Its time to go no contact at this point despite if any apologies have been made or not. Ruining a few birthdays isn\u2019t the same thing as trying to ruin someone\u2019s life.", "Yeah saying that \"now alcohol can ruin your birthday too\" is intentional. He was trying to ruin the day because he's harboring resentment over whatever OP did. However much that bitterness may be deserved by OP's past alcoholism, if it's really that dark of a cloud over the brother, he should stop contact himself instead of doing revolting stunts like this.\n\nKind of wonder if the brother was always the parents' favorite and that's part of what pushed OP down this path, or if he's seriously wronged the parents in the past as well.", "Sounds like brother also has anger and/or jealousy issues trying to sabotage the party. Family should be supportive when OP is working on recovery", "I think bro is just ultra kinky and wanted that expensive glass bottle inserted into his anus because obviously that's the most likely outcome after he behaved like a horses ass.", "Your brother is a cruel, cruel person. \n\nYou are being a fantastic father - congratulations on your sobriety, and I wish you and your family a happy and healthy future!", "I'm the daughter of an alcoholic. My father ruined my 11th birthday, among other things, with his drinking.\n\nI'm very, very happy for and proud of you, and I'm so glad to hear that your relationships with your children are mending.", "Fair point, I didn't consider that. Like I said, it wasn't relevant, I was just curious.", "I have a hard time imagining the info that would make OP an asshole here.\n\nHe nebulously ruined previous parties, presumably due to his alcoholism. He is now insistent that alcohol is removed from his house, and it's forced into his hand.", "There was a throwaway comment about \"other birthdays being ruined\".  The brother seems to have been clearly an AH but I was wondering if there is backstory between the 2 brothers that might make this kind of birthday gathering inadvisable.", "There was. And OP has admitted being an asshole in the past, due to his alcoholism. *None* of that makes his brother less of an AH in this situation.", "Agree, was just deciding between n-t-a and e-s-h.  Sometimes family dynamics/dysfunction make it obvious that a celebration of this type won't work (I speak from experience.)  Smaller groups and different types can work better.  By adulthood one usually knows what the family dynamic can and can't handle."]}
