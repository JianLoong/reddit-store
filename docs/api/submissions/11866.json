{"id": 11866, "submission_id": "11mu3qa", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to take off his street clothes before getting in bed?", "selftext": "My husband (both in our 30s) has a tendency to come home from work pretty exhausted. I make him dinner, make sure the house is tidy, feed the dog and make the bed so he doesn\u2019t have to do much when he gets here. \n\n\nThe issue that comes up is when he comes upstairs to bed and lounge. Before he even makes it up the stairs, I ask him to please take off his street clothes and change into comfy clothes or just hang in his boxers. Often times, he ends up falling asleep with all of his clothes on anyway. Jeans, belt, button downs. \n\n\nI refuse to sleep or snuggle him with the clothes he wore all day out to the office, grocery shopping, etc., and it\u2019s gotten so bad that I now wake him up and ask him to change. He gets pissy and actually argues with me that he\u2019s comfortable. Eventually he relents, but I\u2019m starting to lose my patience on this. He says I need to let him sleep but I disagree. It\u2019s disgusting. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: a word.\n\n\n\nEdit: I appreciate the immediate suggestions to go ahead and divorce my husband over this issue. I am not divorcing my husband over this. Despite this post, my husband and I have a very loving and collaborative marriage. I enjoy my life with him. As many of you suggested, he may need to see a doctor so I am pressing him on it tonight.

I wash my sheets regularly (every third day) and refuse to wear any outdoor clothes in bed whatsoever. As soon as my day finishes I shower change into \"comfy clothes\" and only then would I consider lounging in bed. It takes less than 5 minutes to change and it sounds perfectly reasonable to me that he do so or sleep on the couch instead if he doesn't want to change.
