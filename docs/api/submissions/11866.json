I wash my sheets regularly (every third day) and refuse to wear any outdoor clothes in bed whatsoever. As soon as my day finishes I shower change into \"comfy clothes\" and only then would I consider lounging in bed. It takes less than 5 minutes to change and it sounds perfectly reasonable to me that he do so or sleep on the couch instead if he doesn't want to change.

So, that is hard to judge..Also, dude seems beyond exhausted. I'm reading this like he eats dinner, lays down after, and passes out.

Or why cant you just wear pants. there are a lot of answers here but you are not willing to go outside what is comfort to you or what rules you deem important.

I hate it when my husband gets on my bed in his work clothes. 9/10 times it\u2019s right after I\u2019ve just put fresh bedding on as well. I just want to sleep in a clean bed. He works a labor intensive outdoor job so his work clothes are filthy.\n\nAlthough, I would feel the same way if he was working in an office I think.", "I literally just bought a book called Don't Sit on My Bed with your outside clothes lmao NTA. I was raised not to sit on or get in bed with my outside clothes. My fianc\u00e9 thought it was extra, but he doesn't complain about getting into his favorite pajamas when we get home from work (I work with the public, he's in construction). At first he complained, but we made it into something fun/NSFW, now it's a ritual for us \ud83d\ude02", "I get where you both are coming from. I will say I sympathize with your husband. Theres something about laying in your bed after a long day in your clothes that is just a small slice of heaven. It's delightful.   \nBut you have made it clear that it's not comfortable for you, which is just as fair of a request.   \nI'd have to say that maybe search for a way that he can relax in his cloths? A lazy boy chair or something? Wont be the same but it gives him something he can collapse in, in his own way to relax.   \n\n\nBut at the end of the day NTA for asking that he allow you to be comfortable as well. It's not painful for him to do, just annoying. I just wanted to give my opinion as someone who sympathizes with how your husband feels.", "NTA\n\nNot only would I not want someone coming to bed with work clothes on, changing clothes when he gets home is leaving work behind and being ready to spend time at home with you. It's a very small thing to ask.", "I was this tired after work (office job) turns out I HAVE A SLEEP DISORDER. \n\nYou are focused on the wrong issue. Fix why he\u2019s so tired and then talk respectable boundaries. Can\u2019t problem solve if you can\u2019t think straight. I\u2019d been sleep deprived for decades. \n\nAlso, separate doonas on the same bed does wonders for different sleep styles. In the short term it would but a barrier between you and the jeans. Long term, it means different weights/thickness/textures to suit individual sleep needs. First time in 20 years I got to have a flannelette doona in winter - he hates the texture and how hot it makes him. Which I respected but missed. We find it helps a LOT.", "NTA that\u2019s gross", "NTA - He needs to just get home and go straight to shower with no stops along the way. He knows he\u2019s going to fall asleep every time and upset you every time yet he continues to disregard you and be disgusting. I\u2019d personally toss his ass out of the bed and wake him up every single time with that bullshit and nastiness. Disgusting and absolutely inconsiderate.", "I'm leaning towards NAH on certain conditions. I agree with OP generally about outside clothes -- I have no issue lounging on the couch in them, but wearing them in bed is a little much. But if the husband is as exhausted as OP describes then there could be medical issues going on.    \n     \nI was recently diagnosed with an underactive thyroid, and for a while I was so exhausted by 5pm that it was a chore to drag myself from my home office to the couch to take a nap, pretty much every day. Getting chores done and doing anything more than microwaving something quick for dinner felt like impossible tasks (slowly improving now that I'm on meds). \n     \nOf course the husband *could* just be lazy or inconsiderate, but as someone who's been through the exhaustion wringer I would recommend checking things out just to be certain. There are a number of medical issues that could cause extreme fatigue and many are easily treatable.", "NTA my hubby would have a heart attack. I used to sit in bed with my street wear too, but my hubby has OCD and I learnt early on that this really bothered him.   \n\n\nSo, I ended up adapting and taking off streetwear before lying in bed. NBD.", "NTA\n\nI barely step through my door before I strip my day clothes off lol.\n\nBut to wear them in bed? Hell naw, that\u2019s nasty.", "NTA\nI'm single and I have a clean job working inside and I still try to shower before bed.", "It\u2019s how you make your bedroom an oasis. See if he would just get naked rather than changing?", "Just like shoes, outdoor clothes don't belong in your bed.  Gross.", "If your husband is THAT tired he might not be getting enough \"quality\" sleep.  Please push him to get a sleep study done.  Obstructive Sleep Apnea can affect a person in many ways and he should get tested ASAP.", "NTA. Before I leave for work, I put my comfy clothes on the bed so I can immediately change into them when I get home.", "Note: I am a messy person and have low standards, in general.\n\nI wouldn't have a problem with someone laying on top of the comforter in their street clothes, provided those clothes are not covered in dirt or soaked in sweat.\n\nBut if you are gonna be on top of the bedsheets, I am gonna need your clothes and body to be clean.  Which is why I shower before I go to bed.", "Exactly! I think this is a nah. But seriously figure these things out before marriage. It's not my cup of \u2615 personally but anyone else is free to do it.", "He works in an office and comes home so tired that OP does all the chores. The bare minimum he can do is put on pjs before getting into bed.", "How often do you think those office chairs are cleaned? Especially if they are mesh or fabric. \n\nI remember watching a show with one of those germ lights a few years ago. The office keyboards were more dirty than the toilets.", "Are offices not equally germ magnets? Is he not interacting with different people? How's it ok to bring all that back home plus sweat to a clean bed? NTA.", "I was thinking the same thing.  These people are serious germaphobes.", "I feel like a crazy person reading these comments. It seems like Redditors shower every time they raise their heart rate for a second and have airlocks in every room of their house where they sanitize and change clothes. And this coming from someone who bathes every single day, I would never even have had a second thought about this.", "If he\u2019s so tired that he can\u2019t do a single chore after work at his office job and needs to lay down, he should be changing into pjs as a bare minimum courtesy to his partner\u2026", "And add to that, that most people dont change their clothes every day if they don't get noticeably dirty, so that might be several days worth of dirt.", "Maybe you should ask support somewhere people actually bathe op lol. It's perfectly OK to want a clean bed. I'd break out in eczema all the time if in your position I get no sleep in dirty beds as itching. \n\nIts way more effort washing sheets often than it is coming to bed clean.", "This, and the fact the panini isn\u2019t actually over. You never know where germs are lurking even if you \u201cfeel\u201d clean.", "Yeah, it\u2019s a miracle the human race survived this long without indoor/outdoor clothes /s\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely *fine*.", "He can't be getting laid at all either.\n\nI'm not sucking anyones dick or putting out if they can't do basic hygiene, even changing before bed let alone actually washing anything. I'd be really upset if my partner grossed me out 5 days a week and upset my sleeping over something so minimal.", "How are you ok with a dirty individual in a clean bed let alone one with clothes on? Have you tried not sleeping in the same bed to show him you're serious?", "What does this dude add to your life other than more mess to clean up?\n\nNTA, stop making him dinner, he can at least feed him damn self if he can\u2019t do the bare minimum of anything else. Dirty ass slob.", "He doesnt even flush the toilet? Yikes. Why are you with this man again?", "Not even change.  Just take them off down to the boxers.", "Lol wearing jeans to sleep is 100% not normal", "Yeah, we totally haven't increased the average human lifespan by like 30+ years since 1900. If it was good enough for our caveman ancestors, it's good enough for us!", "Just a few plagues here and there. No biggy.", "Just a few plagues here and there. No biggy.", "He\u2019s a grown man! He can change his dang clothes. And set out his own lounge clothes to change into. Don\u2019t coddle him like this. He\u2019s not a toddler who needs help changing his clothes.", "Yeah I messed up. Definitely NTA. When I commented I lazily didn\u2019t  bother to look through her comments. She does way more than she should for him.", "So, you'd make a point of pissing off your wife rather than take a minute or two to make sure she can sleep comfortably as well, just because she asked you to do so?\n\nWhat a prize you are.", "...you're gonna have a happy marriage. /s", "This has to be bait, I didn't think anyone but the homeless slept fully dressed. Maybe fourteenth century European peasants.", "just because you can\u2019t see the dirt, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there", "> I wake him up then and he argues.\n\nIn the words of Floorwalker Carr \"No one will sit in the bunks with dirty pants on.

I\u2019m fine with my man undressing me if he wants and of course undressing him. I figured it was worth a try and could make it a more playful situation rather than end in argument and frustration.", "Whatever.\n\nno, I wouldn't give in to unreasonable demands from my wife.  Why does her comfort trump his?\n\nIt doesn't sound like a balanced thing to me, at all.", "I'd never be involved with anybody with those insane levels of germaphobia.", "Well, except lots of people nap dressed.  Undressing for a nap, that's pretty unusual.\n\nGetting in bed for the night?  Why, yes, at that point I take my clothes off.", "Not because we discovered what germs are or anything.", "Taking off your outside clothes before you get into bed is a very normal level of cleanliness. It\u2019s only over the top to nasty people.", "Please articulate to me how being asked to change into clean clothes before you \nclimb into the bed your wife cleaned and prepared for you is an unreasonable demand.\n\nPlease explain how it's unbalanced on your wife's side for your wife to do the laundry, prepare the bed for you to sleep in and only ask that you not get into the bed with clothing you've been wearing all day for 10+ hours.\n\nGo ahead champ. All you.", "She says he can take his clothes off and just wear his boxers or change. How is it unreasonable?", "If she does 90% of the cooking and cleaning and always makes the damn bed, he can take his street clothes off. Or he can get his own bed. \n\nThis is one of many reasons I do not share a bed with my partner. I like my bed how I like it and only I\u2019m responsible for it (plus I decide who gets on or in it).", "just because you can\u2019t see the dirt, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there.", "Lol, I realize you're a teenager or early 20s at best, but when you're actually an adult and responsible for managing a household and keeping your space clean/healthy/livable, you'll change your mind.", "Ok, I can't argue with that. Except jeans have to be the worst napping accoutrement, probably especially for guys.", "And, that is the reasonable answer.", "Or they won't. In which case, *eeurggh*", "55, babe.\n\nSo, again, no, I wouldn't get involved with somebody that squeamish about things.    Because, being an adult, I know better than to have a partner with incompatible habits to mine.", "Why?\n\nI find them comfy.  I find what others mean by comfy clothes really uncomfortable.

I'm single because nobody makes me want not to be.\n\nI don't expect people to have to change to cater to me, and that, somehow, is worth scorn?"]}
