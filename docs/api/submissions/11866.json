I make him dinner, make sure the house is tidy, feed the dog and make the bed so he doesn\u2019t have to do much when he gets here. \n\n\nThe issue that comes up is when he comes upstairs to bed and lounge. Before he even makes it up the stairs, I ask him to please take off his street clothes and change into comfy clothes or just hang in his boxers. Often times, he ends up falling asleep with all of his clothes on anyway. Jeans, belt, button downs. \n\n\nI refuse to sleep or snuggle him with the clothes he wore all day out to the office, grocery shopping, etc., and it\u2019s gotten so bad that I now wake him up and ask him to change. He gets pissy and actually argues with me that he\u2019s comfortable. Eventually he relents, but I\u2019m starting to lose my patience on this. He says I need to let him sleep but I disagree. It\u2019s disgusting. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: a word.\n\n\n\nEdit: I appreciate the immediate suggestions to go ahead and divorce my husband over this issue. I am not divorcing my husband over this. Despite this post, my husband and I have a very loving and collaborative marriage. I enjoy my life with him. As many of you suggested, he may need to see a doctor so I am pressing him on it tonight.

I wash my sheets regularly (every third day) and refuse to wear any outdoor clothes in bed whatsoever. As soon as my day finishes I shower change into \"comfy clothes\" and only then would I consider lounging in bed. It takes less than 5 minutes to change and it sounds perfectly reasonable to me that he do so or sleep on the couch instead if he doesn't want to change.

Or why cant you just wear pants. there are a lot of answers here but you are not willing to go outside what is comfort to you or what rules you deem important.

Be forewarned though; after he got out of the shark t-shirt phase, he began his nudist phase of life which lasted way too many years \ud83d\ude43", "Wait\u2026what\u2019s the thing about the toilet without a lid?? I\u2019ve never heard anything about that before", "I have never seen such stinkness in my life. People bathing themselves and their kids ONCE or twice for the week.", "This is why every time I watch an American tv show and they walk into their home (or worse yet climb into bed!!) with their shoes on I go off on a rant. Where I live in Canada if someone wears their outdoor footwear inside your house, unless you live in a barn or something it\u2019s a massive no. Why would you want to spread whatever you stepped in all day all over your floors? Or worse yet, your bed?! Like people spit on the streets, there\u2019s dog crap and chewed gum and who knows what else. Just massively disgusting. If you must wear indoor footwear buy some damn moccasins from an Indigenous maker and keep them for inside.", "You being downvoted shows how nasty some people are. A LOT of people don\u2019t shower daily. It\u2019s gross.", "So by your logic - no point in washing my hands if they aren\u2019t visibly dirty, I\u2019ve wiped in the bathroom but I can\u2019t see any mess on my hands so any bodily waste on them is no problem. Oh someone put out a bowl of m&ms, let\u2019s grab a handful."]}
