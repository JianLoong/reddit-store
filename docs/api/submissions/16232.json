Should she be forced to drop out of the program because of a matter of a few weeks of timing? The pregnant students were given reasonable accommodations so that they could complete their work before their due dates. Sure, it was a bit obtuse for this one student to complain about the instructors; but you could have kindly pointed that out to her rather than tell her that she's not allowed to have any opinions because she had an accommodation. \n\nIf these placements really are so difficult for you all to find on your own, this is an issue you need to bring up with your school and your instructors because their expectations are unrealistic for the job market in your area. It's not the fault of any individual students that the parameters of your program are out of whack.", "NTA - just because you are pregnant doesnt mean you cant look for an internship", "Maybe I'm missing something, but in what world is it a huge challenge to give work away for free? Who is saying no to this? If a company who would want one free intern, it seems like they should want more than one, if they can get them. \n\nAlso, full time student/new mother, doesn't exactly sound like a privileged category of people here. It may have been easier to get this one thing, but sounds like probably everything else about their lives is harder, and unless the goal is to just exclude young women from this field, those accommodations are important and worthwhile. YTA", "This exactly, it was a reasonable accommodation, OP shouldn't have said what they said. But this absolutely could've all been avoided had the pregnant students said nothing. Unless someone else attacked them first, they are equally to blame for contributing to this issue, knowing the ones who don't have a placement are stressed out of their mind with this.", "This is my take. Do I think that OP should have said what they said, not really. However, it would be a major blind spot to for the girl who didn\u2019t have to go to all that trouble of being rejected and researching to find a placement to stick up for practices that clearly benefited her. I\u2019m all for accommodation and equity, but why are the profs just now starting to help the few who were struggling? Seems a bit odd and unfair.", "Their pregnancies and the result are their business. Basically with your comment you are saying that pregnant students are entitled to have their professors do the hard parts for them when it comes to things like this. If the professors are willing to make direct calls and ask for these internships for these two women, then why won't they make those exact same calls for the rest of their students? The other students would obviously be easier to place since they don't have to have all the special accommodations made for upcoming birth. But no, since the other students aren't pregnant, they have to struggle without the resources provided to the pregnant students and hope to find a position in a very limited pool available. Do it for all or do it for none. No matter how you slice this, it was an unfair advantage.", "I don\u2019t really see how the description of early parenthood is relevant.also, sure the professors just made a phone call, but that wasn\u2019t extended to others at all, and that simple action impacted so much of the students outcomes.", "What I\u2019m sayin is it isn\u2019t special treatment or even an unfair advantage. It\u2019s acknowledging that two students had a medical condition that the other students don\u2019t have and because of that they need to complete their work placement earlier. If we were talking about any other medical condition, would your feelings on the issue be the same?  \n\nIt\u2019s a lot easier to make calls for two students before the semester starts than it is to do it for several students while the semester is underway and they have way more issues to handle. The instructors can\u2019t force these places to their students. All they can do is ask. Also this is internship season so the places they\u2019re contacting are getting a lot more internship and work places inquiries right now than they probably did a few months ago.", "It\u2019s not a description of \u201cearly\u201d parenthood. It\u2019s a description of what someone goes through after enduring child birth, which is a complicated and dangerous medical procedure.", "For sure! I just don\u2019t really think it\u2019s relevant in determining assholery.", "Now you're at least being honest. \"I don't know nearly enough about pregnancy, but I hate when other people get accommodations, so clearly these women are at fault for needing them.\" Much more to the point than some bs about entitlement or whatever.", "ope! you gave the game (misogyny) away by calling them \"girls\" instead of \"women.\" y'all stay telling on yourselves.", "she felt entitled to special treatment, which is why she made the AH comment telling the other kid to suck it up despite not facing the same treatment as the rest of the class.", "is that really an issue? i call my full grown friends boys all the time brother.", "And where does it say that she claimed she was entitled to special treatment? Where does OP say that she told the other student to \"suck it up\"? Your imagination doesn't count.\n\nBecause what I read was that someone who had been very reasonably accommodated failed to read the room and defended the teachers who helped her when another student said they were useless. Not all this nonsense that you're going on about."]}
