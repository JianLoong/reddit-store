Well if you are late and you are getting there yourself, I don't care. But if I am there to pick someone up or we are leaving together I need them to be on time. I refuse to be late because of another person. It's a big issue for me because growing up my parents would be late to everything. We'd always arrive at a movie 10 minutes+ into the movie (after the commercials.) If we were supposed to be somewhere I just KNEW we'd be late. Even to important things that would reflect poorly on me. They'd make me late to all of them. So if I say we are leaving at this time or I will pick you up at this time. I mean that time. And my friends know this. They make jokes about times when I pulled up and waited until the exact time and just drove off to the destination.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently we had a 4 day getaway with a few friends planned. One of my chronically late friends that knows how I am with these things asked me to pick her up. I told her that we were leaving at this exact time and that if she isn't there I will just go. I've never picked her up before but she usually arrives late to hangouts which I don't mind. As long as you're not making ME late I don't care. You can miss half the movie, oh well. The day came and I drove to her apartment. I was a few minutes early and texted that I was there. I didn't get a response until the agreed time she said she'd be at the car. She said \"just a few minutes.\" I texted that I am going to the airport and that she should arrange an Uber. I just drove off and like 40 minutes later while I was at the airport she called me asking where I was. Which told me that I would have been waiting there for 40 minutes so I think I made a good choice. I told her that I said I was going to the airport. She said she thought I was joking and got pissed and even said \"such a typical man.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe ended up missing the flight and having to take a later flight and missed the first day of vacation. My friends are on my side and think it's silly that she is still so upset about it. They are like \"you know how he rolls. this was your fault\" and \"why would you expect someone to wait 40 minutes?\" Her best friend that is also friends with us is taking her side and said I was mean. I guess I do feel bad because we all put money toward this vacation and she missed a whole day of it.

Like did she miss the flight because she was 40 minutes late, or because getting the Uber and everything took extra time on top of that?", "If it actually took her 40 minutes, then NTA. However I DO think you should have given her a little more of a chance when you were waiting.

Either she enjoys the power of holding people to her schedule or she's really just so unorganized that she can't keep it together. Either way, not your problem.

The level of anguish and anxiety I experienced all my childhood going places with them, I still remember.

You can establish a boundary without being unreasonable.  I think a text saying, \u201cI will leave in 5 minutes after the agreed-upon time,\u201d would be fine.  However, even normally punctual people can run a couple minutes late, so I think a few minutes grace period should be allowed and expected.", "NTA, dilly-daddle couldn't hold up her end of a social contract when it was well known what the terms were. You do seem pretty rigid about the issue but if you've made it this far within a group of friends and still garnered a reputation of this is 'how you roll', than I can only assume you've been fair and polite about your implementation of this attitude thus far. Can I ask though, if it turned out your flight was delayed by 40 minutes though, would you have been happy to wait for said her?", "NTA.  Though I do think you were a little anal about leaving immediately.  But yeah, 40 minutes it crossing the line.", "Please allow for a five-minute grace period in the future.  It will allow for any unforeseen issues and your flexibility will be gratefully appreciated by your friends.  Bring too rigid can be very off-putting, and at some point in your life, you may start to understand how someone can be 3 minutes off the mark in their time management.  Life happens sometimes and we all need a little grace occasionally.\n\nIn this situation, NTA.  No reasonable grace period would have made a difference and she was warned.  The only thing I would have done differently is warned her when I arrived that the car was leaving in five minutes, with or without her.  It keeps the boundary in place with no surprises to the person on the other end.  Again, you would appear less rigid without being a pushover.", "I think it would be better if you\u2019d have waited ten minutes before calling her again and asking why she hadn\u2019t come out yet. \n\nBeing late isn\u2019t always a problem\n\nbut if she had ended up spending way way more time than acceptable, like she probably would, driving off would be acceptable.\n\nHonestly it is an asshole move to just leave if they\u2019re not out there on time, at least wait a bit", "YTA. You can hate being late all you want. As long as you are inflexible and demanding everyone will think of you as the asshole. Which is reasonable when you're known to doi stuff like what you posted about. You might not like it but that doesn't really factor into whether or not you're an asshole. You can believe in your heart that you aren't the asshole but that's not going to make people change their minds or want to be your friend", "I'm actually gonna go with YTA\n\nBeing so hard-coded to times like that makes me wonder if you've been evaluated for any neurospiciness.\n\nThe thing is, she texted you she was just a minute or two. She wasn't noncommunicative, which I would understand then leaving on time. \n\nYou cost her an Uber and whatever it cost to change her flight. You should just not offer to pick people up anymore because you are unreliable.", "NTA, but your attitude is a little concerning. Your friend sounds irresponsible and should have known better. You 100% didn\u2019t have to miss your flight just because she couldn\u2019t manage her time well. That being said, if you feel *this* strongly about being late, you might want to consider seeing a therapist to try and unpack why you have such a strong emotional reaction to lateness. Being a little late to things isn\u2019t a big deal sometimes, but it sounds like it\u2019s always a big deal to you.", "YTA, potentially an ESH, but you're definitely an asshole. Instead of passive aggressively driving off like a dick bag at the exact moment you were supposed to meet, you should have used your phone to call the late person in question. At bare minimum, you should have send \"If you're not here in 5 minutes, I'm leaving because I don't want to miss the flight.\"\n\n If you're picking somebody up last minute and will leave if they're a second late, that needs to be communicated prior to picking them up. She didn't grab an Uber because she probably didn't seriously think you peeled out of town without her, and probably thought you were around the block trying to make her nervous.\n\nPrior to the age of atomic clocks, cell phones, and wifi, every clock had a slightly different time and was set by hand. People still think in this fuzzy almost this time mindset because they aren't robots. When you say \"Let's meet at 12:00 O'clock\", what you're really saying is \"Let's meet in the window between 11:55 and 12:05pm to account for the fuzzy time. If you want to meet at exactly 12:00pm or before, you need to state that exactly, or even better, \"I want to leave your place before 12pm, so I'll arrive shortly before.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I prefer being on time to things as well, and if I was going to something that had a specific start time (like the movies or a flight), then yes I would expect promptness.

I\u2019m baffled that I\u2019m having to explain this.", "She\u2019s a huge AH if she expected you to wait 40 min but if you cant give a friend a few minutes latitude and just peel out, thats kind of AH behavior too", "Her making you wait 40 mins is ridiculous, but you not waiting like 5 mins is crazier.", "She didn't pay me. She around for a ride and people know she is late so they turned her down. Then she asked me and I said yes because I live near her but that I would leave right on time regardless of whether she is there.", "Okay well tell that to the people who won't want to hang out with OP anymore. Don't tell me, I'm not the one who's pissed off at them", "If having boundaries and standards that are unmovable is being proud then I guess I'm proud. I told her the day she asked that if she was late I would leave.", "I'm baffled by the fact that the OP was the one doing a favour by driving her and is getting shit for it. She didn't do him a favour by letting them drive her. I don't drive, and so if someone is doing me a favour by picking me up I'm adjusting to them, not asking them to adjust to be me. And if indeed I were to be late - which may happen  - I let people know I'm gonna be late, and by how much and let them go without me - I don't want others to be late on the account of my needing a fucking snooze, which I am certain that it's what happened here.", "I mean people could just be on time like a full grown adult should", "Lmao don't rely on someone who is punctual to pick you up if you're chronically late. It's like eating something you're intolerant to and then complaining about it hurting your stomach it's SELF inflicted. At no point does it state people don't want to hang with OP", "Having boundaries isn't being proud, you're proud of your boundaries. You like the fact you're known for it, that people make jokes about it. It's your \"thing\", of course you're proud. You're the main character so honestly I'm not sure why you're asking for our opinions on this", "Get ready to have fewer and fewer people in your life as you continue to age if you are this inflexible.  People will not want to deal with you.", "Out of curiosity- what would you happen if you showed up late due to some unforeseen circumstances?", "It's the natural progression of saying that you're going to pick someone up and then leaving with out them.\n\nYou seem really invested in changing my mind on this. You're not going to. Keep seething though.", "\"Main character\" what is this gen z twitter lingo. To me this is a simple matter of \"if you do this thing I will do this thing.\" \\*person does thing\\* \"why would you do that thing you said you'd do!?\"", "People who are disrespectful of your time by being habitually late are not people you should regret leaving behind. They won't notice right away either", "I've been driving my self since I was 17 and it's been 10 years of picking people up. Never had an issue", "Lmao you wish I was seething, I just like calling AH an AH when I see them. Self centered babies who have no awareness of other people are AHs regardless of how bad you want it to not be because it strikes too close to home \ud83d\udc8b", "Seems like you're being obtuse on purpose.  You are deliberately refusing to see what people are trying to tell you.", "Oh absolutely.  But also, people who are so disrespectful of you that they will speed off the second the clock hits the time you're supposed to be picked up (which OP admits to doing), are not people you should regret leaving behind either.", "It will eventually happen.  Even though I am an extremely prompt person, I would never ask you to drive me.  I would be to worried that I would be walking down the staircase 30 seconds too late and you would speed off right as I got to the bottom.  I promise you, your rigidity will not serve you well in the long run.", "Oh you're seething all right. And it's hilarious how self-centered you are by thinking that other people are self-centered for trying to make an actual, practical change in a world that is utterly fucked", "Perhaps those flexible people should not be asking favours of people whose boundaries mean nothing and will take 4o extra minutes to go to an AIRPORT. Where planes also don't wait. Them planes are also such inflexible dicks", "Once his friends start driving themselves he'll be getting fewer invites to hang out, for sure", "Lmao here you are still responding \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 stop projecting so hard onto me. We get it, you've shown everyone you're BIG mad and self conscious that this post hits home. Set an alarm clock, wake up a little earlier, be accountable. You'll get there one day bud, I believe in you \u2764\ufe0f"]}
