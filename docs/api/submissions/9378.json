Well if you are late and you are getting there yourself, I don't care. But if I am there to pick someone up or we are leaving together I need them to be on time. I refuse to be late because of another person. It's a big issue for me because growing up my parents would be late to everything. We'd always arrive at a movie 10 minutes+ into the movie (after the commercials.) If we were supposed to be somewhere I just KNEW we'd be late. Even to important things that would reflect poorly on me. They'd make me late to all of them. So if I say we are leaving at this time or I will pick you up at this time. I mean that time. And my friends know this. They make jokes about times when I pulled up and waited until the exact time and just drove off to the destination.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently we had a 4 day getaway with a few friends planned. One of my chronically late friends that knows how I am with these things asked me to pick her up. I told her that we were leaving at this exact time and that if she isn't there I will just go. I've never picked her up before but she usually arrives late to hangouts which I don't mind. As long as you're not making ME late I don't care. You can miss half the movie, oh well. The day came and I drove to her apartment. I was a few minutes early and texted that I was there. I didn't get a response until the agreed time she said she'd be at the car. She said \"just a few minutes.\" I texted that I am going to the airport and that she should arrange an Uber. I just drove off and like 40 minutes later while I was at the airport she called me asking where I was. Which told me that I would have been waiting there for 40 minutes so I think I made a good choice. I told her that I said I was going to the airport. She said she thought I was joking and got pissed and even said \"such a typical man.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe ended up missing the flight and having to take a later flight and missed the first day of vacation. My friends are on my side and think it's silly that she is still so upset about it. They are like \"you know how he rolls. this was your fault\" and \"why would you expect someone to wait 40 minutes?\" Her best friend that is also friends with us is taking her side and said I was mean. I guess I do feel bad because we all put money toward this vacation and she missed a whole day of it.

You can establish a boundary without being unreasonable.  I think a text saying, \u201cI will leave in 5 minutes after the agreed-upon time,\u201d would be fine.  However, even normally punctual people can run a couple minutes late, so I think a few minutes grace period should be allowed and expected.", "NTA, dilly-daddle couldn't hold up her end of a social contract when it was well known what the terms were. You do seem pretty rigid about the issue but if you've made it this far within a group of friends and still garnered a reputation of this is 'how you roll', than I can only assume you've been fair and polite about your implementation of this attitude thus far. Can I ask though, if it turned out your flight was delayed by 40 minutes though, would you have been happy to wait for said her?", "NTA.  Though I do think you were a little anal about leaving immediately.  But yeah, 40 minutes it crossing the line.", "Please allow for a five-minute grace period in the future.  It will allow for any unforeseen issues and your flexibility will be gratefully appreciated by your friends.  Bring too rigid can be very off-putting, and at some point in your life, you may start to understand how someone can be 3 minutes off the mark in their time management.  Life happens sometimes and we all need a little grace occasionally.\n\nIn this situation, NTA.  No reasonable grace period would have made a difference and she was warned.  The only thing I would have done differently is warned her when I arrived that the car was leaving in five minutes, with or without her.  It keeps the boundary in place with no surprises to the person on the other end.  Again, you would appear less rigid without being a pushover.", "I think it would be better if you\u2019d have waited ten minutes before calling her again and asking why she hadn\u2019t come out yet. \n\nBeing late isn\u2019t always a problem\n\nbut if she had ended up spending way way more time than acceptable, like she probably would, driving off would be acceptable.\n\nHonestly it is an asshole move to just leave if they\u2019re not out there on time, at least wait a bit", "YTA. You can hate being late all you want. As long as you are inflexible and demanding everyone will think of you as the asshole. Which is reasonable when you're known to doi stuff like what you posted about. You might not like it but that doesn't really factor into whether or not you're an asshole. You can believe in your heart that you aren't the asshole but that's not going to make people change their minds or want to be your friend", "I'm actually gonna go with YTA\n\nBeing so hard-coded to times like that makes me wonder if you've been evaluated for any neurospiciness.\n\nThe thing is, she texted you she was just a minute or two. She wasn't noncommunicative, which I would understand then leaving on time. \n\nYou cost her an Uber and whatever it cost to change her flight. You should just not offer to pick people up anymore because you are unreliable.", "NTA, but your attitude is a little concerning. Your friend sounds irresponsible and should have known better. You 100% didn\u2019t have to miss your flight just because she couldn\u2019t manage her time well. That being said, if you feel *this* strongly about being late, you might want to consider seeing a therapist to try and unpack why you have such a strong emotional reaction to lateness. Being a little late to things isn\u2019t a big deal sometimes, but it sounds like it\u2019s always a big deal to you.", "YTA, potentially an ESH, but you're definitely an asshole. Instead of passive aggressively driving off like a dick bag at the exact moment you were supposed to meet, you should have used your phone to call the late person in question. At bare minimum, you should have send \"If you're not here in 5 minutes, I'm leaving because I don't want to miss the flight.\"\n\n If you're picking somebody up last minute and will leave if they're a second late, that needs to be communicated prior to picking them up. She didn't grab an Uber because she probably didn't seriously think you peeled out of town without her, and probably thought you were around the block trying to make her nervous.\n\nPrior to the age of atomic clocks, cell phones, and wifi, every clock had a slightly different time and was set by hand. People still think in this fuzzy almost this time mindset because they aren't robots. When you say \"Let's meet at 12:00 O'clock\", what you're really saying is \"Let's meet in the window between 11:55 and 12:05pm to account for the fuzzy time. If you want to meet at exactly 12:00pm or before, you need to state that exactly, or even better, \"I want to leave your place before 12pm, so I'll arrive shortly before.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I prefer being on time to things as well, and if I was going to something that had a specific start time (like the movies or a flight), then yes I would expect promptness.
