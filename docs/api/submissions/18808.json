I mean rainbows have been around for longer than people.\n\nJust because rainbows were used by a marginalised group as a symbol doesn't mean all rainbows are suddenly representing that group.\n\nIt's like saying all alphabet books with 'A is for apple' are advertising Apple products.\n\nPeople can wear and enjoy rainbows and rainbow colors without making a political statement, especially children just living their life on a normal day.\n\nIf someone is wearing rainbows at a pride rally, sure, or if they have a big slogan saying pride (still isn't political its human rights).\n\nThe only people making it nasty, divisive and political are the people trying to control what others wear, and come to frankly outrageous conclusions for what someone might be thinking based on wearing bright colours and unicorns.", "Omg that sounds cute as fuck!", "And Lisa Frank...", "OMG can you see them freaking the hell out over Rainbow Brite?", "This is what really gets me here. The message isn\u2019t about sexuality or gender at all.", "As in the specific shades and hues. There\u2019s a difference between the specific hexcode/Pantone/whatever colors that are typically used on pride related merchandise and just any old rainbow.", "And Rainbow Brite or She-Ra\u2019s Unicorn", "I don't think that's true lol. I guess there may be specific shades/ hues that are typically used on Pride flags and other merch, but a rainbow can use any rainbow colors. If they happen to match the ones on a pride flag, that doesn't mean the rainbow is a pride rainbow. It's just.... a rainbow.", "And fluppy dogs (each dog was a different colour of the rainbow)."]}
