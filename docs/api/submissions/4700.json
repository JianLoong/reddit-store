But this is advice for your sis (which you can freely tell me to kick rocks for!) A lot of times, masc presenting women struggle to find clothes that walk the androgyny line because the clothes are cut boxy. If you guys are able (and it shouldn't be too expensive), do a test run of getting a pair of pants + button down professionally tailored. It's a great way to still wear the clothes she likes, and still present the way she wants to. I know that where I'm from, tailoring (even hemming) can be like $10-20. There are also queer tailors that do trans clothing, and even tho your sister isn't trans, the tailor may get what she's going for a bit easier than a traditional tailor. xxxx a wlw", "Let\u2019s see \u201cwalks like a duck, talks like a duck\u201d\n\u201cIf the shoe fits..\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a dozen more we could add. \n\nSadly some people need to find out hard way how horrible some people really are.

Ask her if she feels comfortable in her body. Not to sus out if she trans, but she may have some body dysphoria if she is/was overweight when younger, did she develop boobs really young? She may have been bullied by classmates or your mom for her body. And I know we don\u2019t want to assume the worst, but she may have been SA in the past, some victims of SA dress super masculine/over sized clothing as a way to protect themselves. I\u2019d leave that question until the very end and maybe only of she\u2019s been seeing a therapist for a bit. \n\nAnd maybe she just really loves guys clothing.

I know you want to protect your sister but the best thing you can do is let her come to her own conclusion otherwise she might resent you because she'll always wonder if she could have had a relationship with the mother. This way she knows and she also knows that you are supportive. Just know that you are doing a great job.", "NTA. On the bright side, your mother showed her true colors from the outset and your sister saw it for herself.", "Nta. She made your sister cry. I would go and take your sis to do her favorite thing and give her some one on one time. Make sure she know she is loved and she is amazi g just the way she is", "NTA\n\nYour mother absolutely deserved every word of that. Her behavior is completely toxic & she doesn\u2019t deserve her children\u2019s love.", "Y T A if you continue to call her your mother. She's your egg donor. Nothing more.", "Well said", "My friend was talking about this ..as sibling always wants her to forgive ...and she is like, to be treated like shit? Sibling says they will die soon and she says I'm okay with that as people don't live forever lol  \n\nHow many times do you have to cry about someone to realize they don't give a f?", "The thing to hold on to here OP is that you\u2019ve so protected you\u2019re younger siblings that they can still _have_ hope that your mom can change or \u201cget better\u201d. That means they still believe people can be good and their trust in humanity is not totally destroyed. Coming from any abusive or neglectful childhood, that is a HUGE accomplishment. I think you should be really proud of yourself for that. \n\nNow, of course, it may be painful for them to start learning that she is who she is and there are good reasons you all haven\u2019t been in contact, but you\u2019ll be there for them when their hearts are inevitably broken and they absorb this tough lesson. It will also be tough for you to watch and deal with as their surrogate parent and as their sibling, but you all have each other and that will be enough, I promise. Good luck, wishing you the best. NTA, of course.", "I know it's not the same as hearing it from someone in your life, but I just want to say I'm proud of you, dude.", "Jeez, that hit home.  That's exactly how I've been feeling since my bio mom died. The relief was staggering and since then massive guilt bc what kind of ahole is relieved at a parents death...", "Happy cake day!", "Oh shit, thanks! 10 years on Reddit and look at me now!", "[removed]", "NTA \n\nBarring the disgraceful display of homophobia by your mother nothing negative about how your sister prefers to present herself should have ever crossed her lips, especially right in front of your sister. You told your mom the truth and shouldn\u2019t feel like an asshole for essentially telling a toxic person to go to hell. \n\nP.S. If you haven\u2019t already now might be a good time to sit your sister down and have a frank (some even may say brutal) come to Jesus meeting with your sister about your situation with y\u2019all\u2019s mom. Explaining to her your feelings about the woman, her patterns and your sister\u2019s tendency to forgive and forget too quickly and your worries about her regarding her attempts to build a relationship with your mom so she\u2019s hopefully more aware of mom\u2019s issues and patterns and keep herself safe.", "NTA. You\u2019re a great sibling. :)", "NTA, (also it sounds like your sister is a Demi boy, if she wants a lane to put on it.)", "NTA \n\nI hope you have at least heard this before, but you\u2019re an amazing person for growing up so fast, becoming a parent for you siblings, and supporting them no matter what. you were given the short straw when it came to mothers but your siblings are so incredibly lucky to have you.", "NTA. You didn't stoop to her level. You just made her aware what level she was on.", "nta but i might be bias bc imo MY mom sucked so im strongly \"traumatize ur parents back\"", "NTA You and your siblings are better off without mom in your life.", "least obvious federal agent", "Yeah ive had them in therapy since i got guardianship. They see the same therapist that they like so i can work with them. My youngest isn't seeing that therapist though. He sees one that specialises in Autism since he has more specialised needs than my other siblings.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

But for now she still identifies as a woman so that's what she is. I want my siblings to be able to safely identify as what they feel they are. Im gay and very into the queer community so they know that no matter what ill support them.", "Its mainly only my sister that wants anything to do with our mother. 16 year old doesnt want anything to do with her and 8 year old doesn't care since shes a stranger. I think a lot of it has to do with age since 16 and 8 see me as dad and my sister just sees me as brother.", "NTA.", "NTA-it\u2019s good of you to be protective of your sister and it even better to let her make up her own mind about your mother. What a hurtful woman.  Write her off completely. What a nasty person she is to attack her own child and make her feel uncomfortable about her appearance and sexuality. You\u2019re doing a great job! Continue to give your sister that support that she needs.

Of all my rotten childhood memories it is my sweet, kind, little brother believing the lies that hurts my heart the most. I was dead inside by age 3 to both of them but not him."]}
