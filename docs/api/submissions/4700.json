You not only stood up for your sister but yourself!! I would gently use this as a teaching moment with your sister as to why you have gone no or low contact with your mother, and suggest that she may want to do so as well.

Good on you for being an amazing older brother and hopefully your sister won\u2019t be too hurt by this inevitable situation.", "NTA,\nI\u2019m sure your sisters hurt but long term this may be the best thing that could have happened with your mother, better than her being manipulated for years.", "Your sister needed that reality check.

I hope your sister will be ok.", "NTA", "NTA, you\u2019re a great brother and from what you\u2019re saying, your mother kinda deserved this. I would suggest talking to your sister about going to therapy or something though, since you stated she\u2019s too forgiving. A child always wants to be loved by their parents and this sometimes doesn\u2019t go away even when the parents are hurting them.

But this is advice for your sis (which you can freely tell me to kick rocks for!) A lot of times, masc presenting women struggle to find clothes that walk the androgyny line because the clothes are cut boxy. If you guys are able (and it shouldn't be too expensive), do a test run of getting a pair of pants + button down professionally tailored. It's a great way to still wear the clothes she likes, and still present the way she wants to. I know that where I'm from, tailoring (even hemming) can be like $10-20. There are also queer tailors that do trans clothing, and even tho your sister isn't trans, the tailor may get what she's going for a bit easier than a traditional tailor. xxxx a wlw", "Let\u2019s see \u201cwalks like a duck, talks like a duck\u201d\n\u201cIf the shoe fits..\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a dozen more we could add. \n\nSadly some people need to find out hard way how horrible some people really are. It\u2019s been a long time since your sister has seen her mom, I\u2019m sure she hoped it wasn\u2019t a a bad as she remembered/you told her, or she possibly glossed it over or blocked out the worst stuff in her mind to protect herself\n\nYour NTA but you should encourage her to see a therapist to deal with the trauma this has probably brought bubbling to the surface (it might not rear it\u2019s ugly head for a bit) and I guess try to do your best to keep your mother away from the younger ones. 19 is old enough to make her own choices and it will be hard not to say \u201cI told you so\u201d but do your best to keep that to yourself. \n\nTry to talk with her about how she felt, that you love her no matter how she dresses. Ask her if she feels comfortable in her body. Not to sus out if she trans, but she may have some body dysphoria if she is/was overweight when younger, did she develop boobs really young? She may have been bullied by classmates or your mom for her body. And I know we don\u2019t want to assume the worst, but she may have been SA in the past, some victims of SA dress super masculine/over sized clothing as a way to protect themselves. I\u2019d leave that question until the very end and maybe only of she\u2019s been seeing a therapist for a bit. \n\nAnd maybe she just really loves guys clothing. I like men\u2019s jeans because they come with FUNCTIONAL pockets lol. Though now that baggy jeans are back on style I get functional pockets again in the women\u2019s jeans\n\nJust let her know you\u2019re always there for her to talk without judgement or criticism.", "NTA", "Very heartbreaking and hopefully your sister now sees the woman for what she truly is and will never agree to meet with her again.", "I wouldn\u2019t say you \u201cstooped to her level,\u201d because frankly she was aggressive and you responded to that.

Being a mother doesn\u2019t automatically entitle you to your child\u2019s love and attention. \n\nYou do need to talk with your sister about therapy.  Your sister is wanting that motherly love she missed out on and will give your mom chance after chance to give this to her only to be burned each time.  Your mom knows this and will manipulate her every chance she gets.  Your sister needs the tools to be able to deal with it, set appropriate boundaries, etc.", "NTA. She does sound like a soulless bitch who doesn't deserve her children's love. She's not entitled to have her adult child in her life. She's not entitled to anything. She decided to be a mother when it's convenient and profitable for her.", "NTA. I think the difference with what you said vs what she said is that yours was reactive- you reacted to her being an arsehole with some spice, not *because* you're an arse. \n\nYou don't owe her kind words.

Sure you thought you knew better than her what she would like and it\u2019s a pretty dick move, but you didn\u2019t do it maliciously I don\u2019t think just stupidly. But what\u2019s more important is: this is easily remedied! Just apologize explain that you thought she might like this better but clearly fucked up, then return it and buy her the sewing machine. It\u2019s only been a day and nothing unforgivable was said. This doesn\u2019t have to be the end of the relationship or anything. Just apologize, return it, buy her a sewing machine and maybe some flowers, and DON\u2019T REPEAT THE SAME MISTAKE!", "I was this sibling for a very long time. Eventually I had enough and I\u2019ve been no contact with my dad for almost 2 years. I feel so bad for your sister because I know exactly how it is to have an addict in your life who you keep on thinking will change. They are so good at making you believe them and it hurts every time they eventually let you down.
