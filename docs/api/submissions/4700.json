You not only stood up for your sister but yourself!! I would gently use this as a teaching moment with your sister as to why you have gone no or low contact with your mother, and suggest that she may want to do so as well.  I would also let you sister know how the conversation went after she left so that she knows you always have her back!!\n\nKeep up the good work in rising your siblings and keep your mother away - nothing good can come from letting her back in.", "I\u2019m going to say, NTA.

Words used may have been harsh but so is what she used when she saw your sister. The disrespect and close-mindedness is dumbfounding. You and your sister deserve better and I'm quite glad you've taken place as guardian and are okay with it. Maybe try again in 5 years, maybe don't, up to you guys but anything is fair game at this point as far as words exchanged / severity of insult.", "NTA\n\nDon't feel bad, man.

I would suggest talking to your sister about going to therapy or something though, since you stated she\u2019s too forgiving. A child always wants to be loved by their parents and this sometimes doesn\u2019t go away even when the parents are hurting them.

But this is advice for your sis (which you can freely tell me to kick rocks for!) A lot of times, masc presenting women struggle to find clothes that walk the androgyny line because the clothes are cut boxy. If you guys are able (and it shouldn't be too expensive), do a test run of getting a pair of pants + button down professionally tailored. It's a great way to still wear the clothes she likes, and still present the way she wants to. I know that where I'm from, tailoring (even hemming) can be like $10-20. There are also queer tailors that do trans clothing, and even tho your sister isn't trans, the tailor may get what she's going for a bit easier than a traditional tailor. xxxx a wlw", "Let\u2019s see \u201cwalks like a duck, talks like a duck\u201d\n\u201cIf the shoe fits..\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a dozen more we could add. \n\nSadly some people need to find out hard way how horrible some people really are. It\u2019s been a long time since your sister has seen her mom, I\u2019m sure she hoped it wasn\u2019t a a bad as she remembered/you told her, or she possibly glossed it over or blocked out the worst stuff in her mind to protect herself\n\nYour NTA but you should encourage her to see a therapist to deal with the trauma this has probably brought bubbling to the surface (it might not rear it\u2019s ugly head for a bit) and I guess try to do your best to keep your mother away from the younger ones. 19 is old enough to make her own choices and it will be hard not to say \u201cI told you so\u201d but do your best to keep that to yourself. \n\nTry to talk with her about how she felt, that you love her no matter how she dresses. Ask her if she feels comfortable in her body. Not to sus out if she trans, but she may have some body dysphoria if she is/was overweight when younger, did she develop boobs really young? She may have been bullied by classmates or your mom for her body. And I know we don\u2019t want to assume the worst, but she may have been SA in the past, some victims of SA dress super masculine/over sized clothing as a way to protect themselves. I\u2019d leave that question until the very end and maybe only of she\u2019s been seeing a therapist for a bit. \n\nAnd maybe she just really loves guys clothing. I like men\u2019s jeans because they come with FUNCTIONAL pockets lol. Though now that baggy jeans are back on style I get functional pockets again in the women\u2019s jeans\n\nJust let her know you\u2019re always there for her to talk without judgement or criticism.", "NTA", "Very heartbreaking and hopefully your sister now sees the woman for what she truly is and will never agree to meet with her again."]}
