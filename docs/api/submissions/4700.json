But this is advice for your sis (which you can freely tell me to kick rocks for!) A lot of times, masc presenting women struggle to find clothes that walk the androgyny line because the clothes are cut boxy. If you guys are able (and it shouldn't be too expensive), do a test run of getting a pair of pants + button down professionally tailored. It's a great way to still wear the clothes she likes, and still present the way she wants to. I know that where I'm from, tailoring (even hemming) can be like $10-20. There are also queer tailors that do trans clothing, and even tho your sister isn't trans, the tailor may get what she's going for a bit easier than a traditional tailor. xxxx a wlw", "Let\u2019s see \u201cwalks like a duck, talks like a duck\u201d\n\u201cIf the shoe fits..\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a dozen more we could add. \n\nSadly some people need to find out hard way how horrible some people really are. It\u2019s been a long time since your sister has seen her mom, I\u2019m sure she hoped it wasn\u2019t a a bad as she remembered/you told her, or she possibly glossed it over or blocked out the worst stuff in her mind to protect herself\n\nYour NTA but you should encourage her to see a therapist to deal with the trauma this has probably brought bubbling to the surface (it might not rear it\u2019s ugly head for a bit) and I guess try to do your best to keep your mother away from the younger ones. 19 is old enough to make her own choices and it will be hard not to say \u201cI told you so\u201d but do your best to keep that to yourself. \n\nTry to talk with her about how she felt, that you love her no matter how she dresses. Ask her if she feels comfortable in her body. Not to sus out if she trans, but she may have some body dysphoria if she is/was overweight when younger, did she develop boobs really young? She may have been bullied by classmates or your mom for her body. And I know we don\u2019t want to assume the worst, but she may have been SA in the past, some victims of SA dress super masculine/over sized clothing as a way to protect themselves. I\u2019d leave that question until the very end and maybe only of she\u2019s been seeing a therapist for a bit. \n\nAnd maybe she just really loves guys clothing. I like men\u2019s jeans because they come with FUNCTIONAL pockets lol.
