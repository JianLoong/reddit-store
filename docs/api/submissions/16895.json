But  you\u2019ve been letting this go on for *two years* before deciding to gather evidence and use it. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re done covering her ass, but you two have a really toxic sounding relationship. Individual or family therapy might be a good idea.", "What a shitty premeditated thing to do to your fraternal twin.\n\nYTA", "You did right, remember that you have to be in first place, always, sister is just a title, she can be your sister and at the same time the biggest asshole in history", "NTA - No contact her (if you live apart, if you don't.. move).", "Edit: NTA my bad I missed the part where OP said her job is animal care. She\u2019s neglectful and deserves to pay the price for her actions. My mistake", "YTA. You're also very petty and you do come off as jealous. Some folks work smarter, not harder. If the boss can't see what's not going on, you don't have to run and be the bitter, tattle tale. I would never trust you with anything. How were you doing your job while hyper-focused on what your twin sister wasn't doing?? The boss clearly can't figure out anything and you took advantage of that. YTA!", "This will be your evil twin origin story.", "NTA, it's not fair to be forced to do someone else's job for them. You attempted to confront her about the issue and she was a dick about it so you escalated it to your boss. Sounds like a standard bad coworker, family or not.", "YTA. She needs to cut you and your nonsense out of her life. What a disgusting thing to do.  Jesus Christ with family like that who needs enemies?", "YTA.", "NTA she fafo", "No we have been working there for 2 years and for 2 years I had to go behind her and actually do the job. I had decided to start making proof incase I felt it was needed. I had no want or need to get the raise.", "Not cleaning the cages and forgetting to feed animals their meals because you can't do your job is also shitty.", "Yeah take a look at the post and read again to see that they work with live animals and the sister hasn't been doing her job. I don't know if you can comprehend this but animal carers who don't do their job shouldn't have that job. OP states that meals were missed and living spaces weren't clean. There is no jealousy bc who would be jealous of a person who thinks it's OK to leave animals like that.", "I see where your coming from. However I had no intent on getting that raise it never even crossed my mind. We worked there for 2 years and after a year I found myself following her to do HER job. My boss even told me it was good i said something instead of letting her get paid for doing nothing. The animals were missing meals missed cages cleanings and walks.", "Thank you for your comment! From what you said I can see how your possibly confused. I was not hyper focused, I have a desk job with someone else and she has the care giving job. Work smarter not harder is fine however theres a difference between working smarter and flat out not doing your job.", "I see where your coming from but you have to understand. We worked at an animal shelter and she left poor animals without food, water, walks, and dirty cages. They would get sick and if I brought it to boss without proof I would get nowhere.", "Its fine that you this k that but would it be possible for you to elaborate on that?", "Yeah i got that. Yo u were covering up her lack of job completion, and then instead of letting her  take a small hit for it, you drop the bomb all at once with gathered evidence.", "Yeah that\u2019s my bad I missed that, thanks for clarifying! That\u2019s disgusting behavior", "So why didn't you report her before that? Why take video? Why not ask for a different shift so you're not following your sister around and someone else can deal with her not doing her work?", "Missing meals and walks??? Okay that\u2019s where I draw the line! In that case NTA - she\u2019s literally putting animals lives in danger and neglecting them when they\u2019re already struggling.", "So you don\u2019t even do the same job and you went out of your way to record everything she was doing wrong? Why, did it affect you?? You sound petty af", "For even thinking that gathering evidence on a colleague and ratting to your boss is acceptable. You're not a manager. Stay in your lane.", "I actually have reported her in the past she plays the blame and crying card so I needed proof. I could not take another shift because my family shares 1 car and the car is only open during that shift.", "I understand how I seem petty. This was mainly done because I am a deep animal lover and seeing that she was making them miss meal, walks, and even cleaning there cages it was not okay. The main reason I picked up evidence is if I went to boss and my sister was confronted she would play the crying card (one she has used a lot) so I had to be prepared.", "I understand where your coming from and I have deeply thought this as well. However we have been working there for two years and for about a year I found I had to follow up on them. Because of her laziness animals had dirty cages, missed meals/walks, and more. I only started when the boss started talking about giving her a raise. I know that sounds petty but its nit okay to let someone do a crappy job and get away with it. Especially when it comes to the health and safety of another living thing!", "Yeah I get that. I didn\u2019t realize she was neglecting animals- in that case you 1000% did the right thing! She\u2019s the AH and it\u2019s time she pays for her actions", "So you just went full scorched earth. \n\nYTA and you know it. Cut the moralizing", "Thank you for your feelings on the subject. I have seen other comments and honestly no I dont feel like an asshole but thank you for your comment", "Assholes seldom feel like they're assholes, because they usually lack the sense of decency and introspection to do so.", "YTA - Covertly tracking your twin sister and using the info to get her fired!!!\n\nIs this Dead Ringers? 2 years of this, and neither of you could choose to work somewhere else and get out of each other's way?\n\nYour solution is to stab her in the back?  YTA", "YTA with friends like that who needs enemies. You messed with your sibling for a meatier raise. I am glad you are not my sibling, who no deserves and apology, you are a bad person and worse rainily member. Your parent must be ashamed. Was it worth it?", "NTA - When you get a job, everyone has to do their fair share. That's the contract with your coworkers. Ignore the family bit, it doesn't matter, it actually counts further against her. It's one thing to be lazy and shunt work off on strangers, it's shitty to do it to your sister, and her reaction when you tried to get her to course correct is sociopathic.\n\nGood on you OP, but be ready for a rocky rest of your life with this lady unless she gets her act together.", "NTA solely because you both worked with animals. When your job is to care for and advocate on behalf of the creatures that depend on you, you don't slack off.  \n\nWhen you slack off at a regular job, you're just a shitty coworker. When you slack off at an animal shelter, the animals suffer and their needs aren't being met. It's animal abuse. She rightfully got canned.", "NTA. Animals deserve the best care and all the love in the world ! They should be treated well and deserve people who will do so! Tho I hope things in your family don\u2019t get messy \ud83d\ude48congrats on the raise tho!", "NTA. This isn't an office job or retail where being lazy only affects the other workers, this is taking care of animals. Laziness directly affects the animals' quality of life, like missed meals or dirty kennels/cages. If it was enough to cause her to be fired, she deserved it.", ">I had no want or need to get the raise.\n\nBut you did have the right, don't feel bad\n\nYou should let your sister be responsable for her own (in)actions, wether she succeds or fails is up to her. You didn't mention your ages but I assume you're both young adults", "YTA for covering for her for 2 years and then dumping all you have done at one time and getting her fired. I would have probably fired you too for covering for her all this time and then complaining about it. You should have just let her things go so that the boss could see she wasn't doing her job and then would have talked to her to get her to do her job or fire her for not doing it.", "Humans are a bit more important than animals. Your sister doesn't have a job now, and that's your fault. Are you going to pay her bills? Make sure she has good to eat? A place to live? Transportation? cloths?  You went above and beyond for stray animals, so I'm sure your own sister has nothing to worry about, right?", "Normally, I'd agree, but leaving things undone when it comes to animal husbandry is fucked up.", "Wtf no! She can get another job. If someone doesn\u2019t take care of those animals they suffer needlessly or die! She\u2019s not going to die because she rightfully lost a job she was obviously terrible at is she?! \n\nWhat a shitty take.", "Yup, that\u2019s a totally good reason to let animals be neglected /s\n\nThe sister was neglecting animals. That is abuse. For that reason alone she deserved to be fired. She can find a job where she is not working with animals or any vulnerable people.", "So do you think the sister deserved to keep her job AND get a raise? While she was not doing her job AND neglecting animals?", "I think OP doesn't deserve her job or her raise either. Backbiting rats are not to be trusted."]}
