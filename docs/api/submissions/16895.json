If the boss can't see what's not going on, you don't have to run and be the bitter, tattle tale. I would never trust you with anything.

I don't know if you can comprehend this but animal carers who don't do their job shouldn't have that job. OP states that meals were missed and living spaces weren't clean.

I could not take another shift because my family shares 1 car and the car is only open during that shift.", "I understand how I seem petty. This was mainly done because I am a deep animal lover and seeing that she was making them miss meal, walks, and even cleaning there cages it was not okay. The main reason I picked up evidence is if I went to boss and my sister was confronted she would play the crying card (one she has used a lot) so I had to be prepared.", "I understand where your coming from and I have deeply thought this as well. However we have been working there for two years and for about a year I found I had to follow up on them. Because of her laziness animals had dirty cages, missed meals/walks, and more.

When your job is to care for and advocate on behalf of the creatures that depend on you, you don't slack off.  \n\nWhen you slack off at a regular job, you're just a shitty coworker.

I would have probably fired you too for covering for her all this time and then complaining about it.

Your sister doesn't have a job now, and that's your fault. Are you going to pay her bills? Make sure she has food to eat? A place to live? Transportation? cloths?  You went above and beyond for stray animals, so I'm sure your own sister has nothing to worry about, right?", "Normally, I'd agree, but leaving things undone when it comes to animal husbandry is fucked up.", "Wtf no! She can get another job. If someone doesn\u2019t take care of those animals they suffer needlessly or die!

That is abuse. For that reason alone she deserved to be fired. She can find a job where she is not working with animals or any vulnerable people.", "So do you think the sister deserved to keep her job AND get a raise?

I have made many comments now explaining she was not letting the animals miss meals walks and cage cleanings.

Sister could have apologized and try to correct her behavior. Instead, she threatened to turn their friends against OP. It was only after this that OP went to management with proof.", "True. I think OP said because it was her sister, she never did anything about it until now. Regarding the recording, agree with you there- although I wonder if the OP meant recorded as in \"documented\"? Maybe? (trying to give benefit of the doubt).", "Downside is that the animals will suffer until the issue gets addressed. Definitely easier to wash your hands of a co-workers tasks when they aren't caring for animals.", "I\u2019m not clear on what OP means by \u201crecording\u201d though. She might have simply been documenting, i.e., recording the words on paper. At any rate, how would you make an audio record of a person not working? What special do they make that proves they\u2019re goofing off?", "I disagree, I think documentation is absolutely the way to go. A loser coworker can also turn into a lying coworker, and the line lazy coworker could claim that they were doing all their work along with your own, unless you have the documentation against it.", "Were you her manager for those 2 years? Meaning- was it part of your job description to make sure her work got done even if she didn't finish it during her shift?  Is it your job to document what other workers are or aren't doing?  \nIf not, then you shouldn't have been doing either of those things. Let her deal with the consequences of being lazy. If that meant animals weren't being cared for properly, you should've let your boss know immediately.  \nIf yes, then you shouldn't have let it go on for so long. Your workplace should have procedures in place for reprimanding employees- putting them on probation (depending on how egregious the wrongdoing is), giving them a chance to do better.  Letting your frustration build for two years (!) and then coming down on someone all at once is really poor management.\n\n  \nYou shouldn't have ratted her out, AND you shouldn't have covered for her all those other times. I'm guessing you guys are pretty young, so make this a learning experience- Do YOUR job, don't do other people's jobs. Regardless of whether you're related to them or not.", "Why did it take two months to show the video evidence she has been collecting?", "Those aren't the only options.", "You can really tell in this thread which respondents are lazy at their jobs, and make their colleagues pick up their slack.", "That's the way I took it, but even that is hugely overstepping if it isn't OP's job to do that.  Sister might've deserved to lose her job, but- ew.", "Please read OP's comments. She tried to address it before.  \n\n\n>I actually have reported her in the past she plays the blame and crying card so I needed proof.\n\nOP wasn't \"building up her frustration\", she was gathering evidence.  \n\n\n>We worked there for 2 years and after a year I found myself following her to do HER job. My boss even told me it was good i said something instead of letting her get paid for doing nothing. The animals were missing meals missed cages cleanings and walks.", "Please read OP's comments.\n\nOP says she reported the sister first, but the sister played the \"poor me\" card and turned on the waterworks.\n\nThis time, after gathering evidence, OP confronted the sister for her laziness. But then the sister doubled down and threatened to turn their friends against OP, without any intention of actually doing her job right - which, in this case, resulted in animals missing meals or not getting their walks.", "You missed both OP's comment and u/Hot_Report_7997 too - OP did report sister's behavior but sister got away by crying and playing the blame game.\n\nManagement couldn't do anything without proof, so that's what OP gathered.\n\nSchemes? Ambush? After having the evidence in hand, OP confronted her sister, who then got angry and threatened to turn all their friends against OP. Sister had no intention of doing a decent job, that's why the animals were missing meals and staying in unclean spaces.", "It sounds like Management was aware of the problem, and just just didn\u2019t have anything solid to justify firing l the lazy twin earlier, until industrious twin brought documentation to the table. At that point they were able to fire her, and they gave industrious twin a raise.", "Which is why she should have been letting her boss know from the beginning instead of doing it and then dropping it on them when the sister got the raise. I'm sure OP started to do it so her sister wouldn't be fired but in doing so she let it get out of hand and the bosses thought OP's sister did all the work. Now she got her sister fired and created a lot of bad blood between them instead of letting the boss teach the sister the right way from the beginning. When I worked at a vet clinic, we wouldn't have let someone do a half ass job and would have brought it up to the management, which is what OP should have done.", "NTA, play stupid games and you win stupid prizes. She got what was coming to her.", "yta. you need to figure out who to have solidarity with in life. family first, and in a job: coworkers. never bosses. your job is out to exploit you, to squeeze every piece of value it can out of you and discard you when you have nothing more to give. wage workers dont ever get \"undeserved\" raises. youre all getting less than you deserve.", "NTA, she needs to learn that she needs to work for her pay.", "yeah taking away someones livelihood is grimy behavior and would be an absolute last resort. wouldnt surprise me if her coworkers froze her out, and she'd deserve it. being a mediocre worker isn't enough to merit poverty", "So...she should have let the animals suffer, so someone ELSE could confirm otherwise she and her sister failed to do their job? Documenting when a co-worker fails to do their job, especially if you have vulnerable children/elderly/etc or animals that suffer when they do not?  Is literally the bare minimum to be a good human being.  You document the issue AND FIX IT so the vulnerable do to suffer.  If the sister is not cleaning the cages, feeding the animals, etc- what exactly do you have a problem with?  She should have continued to cover the ABUSE of those animals that her sister's laziness was resulting in?  I am confused. We are not talking about an office job- but even then- you bet I have documented and reported when someone lied about doing work that others did to get a raise- and yeah, got them fired (not my work, but people on my team).  You do not get to lie and steal credit and succeed in this life. Or maybe you do?", "I can't get past her sitting on knowledge & evidence for 2 years....that's collusion.", "NTA for calling her out, but YTA for recording her for two months without her knowledge. That really creepy stalker behavior. Yikes.", "NTA.  Proud of you!", "NTA.\n\nI'm going into animal care soon (zookeeping), and the only remotely asshole thing you did was not getting evidence and bringing it to your boss sooner imo. From your comments, this has been happening for two years. You probably should have confronted her, and if that didn't work, start collecting evidence within the first year. Your boss might have worked to get her training or just fire her if that wasn't working.\n\nThat being said, you aren't the asshole. Your sister should not be working in animal care if she is going to neglect the animals in your care. I understand you want to protect your sister and make sure she's alright financially, but if she wasn't going to take care of the living beings placed in her care then she frankly needed to get a different job. That job should go to people who will actually put in that care.\n\nI hope your sister is able to find a new job, I wouldn't be entirely surprised if she ends up butting heads with management and other coworkers, though. It's something she'll have to learn, that her coworkers aren't gonna want to do her job for her.", "I don't understand how anybody can mentally stand being a lazy caregiver. If any kind. Other sentient beings are suffering or living a subpar quality of life because of someone's laziness?? I would, actually, die of fucking shame", "I hope to G-d this is bait because the behavior this post describes is just animal abuse happening for two years.", "If OP stopped doing the tasks then the animals they were in charge of caring for would have suffered (possibly causing the entire establishment to shut down and OP and other people lose their jobs as well) so that is in no way how to handle this kind of situation. Recording that the other employee isn't doing the work proves that OP was, and still ensures that the animals are cared for. \n\nAs for how it will make other employee's think of her, they only thing they \"wouldn't trust her with\" is hiding them not doing their job properly (and a boss is absolutely going to adore an employee who ensures they aren't rewarding bad behavior or continuing to employ people who are neglecting their responsibilities (which in this situation involved other living creatures that the owner of the company would be held responsible for if anything bad were to happen do to the negligence of those employees)\n\nThere are also only a handful of states that have laws against recording people in public spaces without their consent (California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington which is only 11 out of 50)", "Yea this is wild I would not have done this to a coworker. But OP sounds very young. She could have handled this directly with the boss but fell into pettiness because it's her sister. Too late now OP that was an extremely aggressive move. YTA but you had every right to feel how you did. Hope your relationship with your sis gets better one day", "Honestly, the only thing that makes this seem fake is the bad grammar. Besides that, it's unfortunately rather common in animal care for people to come in expecting to get paid to pet dogs all day, only to not want to or be willing to learn how to provide actual care. These people are usually weeded out after a few months, but it's not hard to imagine someone picking up the slack for their sibling.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't really be surprised if this story was made up. It's just a shame that if this were better written, I'd absolutely 100% believe it.", "It might've taken that long to collect compelling evidence that would actually be deemed 'actionable' and get her the results. Cops can be very, very lazy employees themselves.", "Because she needed to show a pattern. Just one day wouldn't be enough. It could be writtern off as a bad day. She recorded consistent negligence so there would be no question.", "Yeah, no. Animals depend on us to take care of them. Her sister was abusing the animals. She needed to be fired. Her sister can find another job and is living at home as she is a minor. She needs to learn to be responsible now so that when she is an adult the OP doesn't have to come on here to ask if she is TA for not allowing her twin to move in with her because she was fired yet again for being lazy.", "I think it's the recording like, videotaping, her sister that has people icked out. Many other ways to handle documenting your work efforts or the lack of efforts of another employee or even just seeing up the situation where the other person visibly fails. It simply talking to the boss and asking them to observe. I have an office job where someone has to pick up the slack because of the work doesn't get done its costly in a way that directly affects the lives of the customers. So the person on paper still looks like they are doing their job. But as the boss I document how much intervention it takes for the work to get done because I don't want my other team members who are glad to help carrying the burden of someone who isn't even trying to pull their weight.", "NTA.  Your sister was neglecting the animals in her care for 2 years, probably because SHE KNEW you\u2019d do it for her and betting that you\u2019d never dare to let anyone know that\u2019s what she was doing.  Her neglect needed to be revealed, because without you doing her job for her, she could have caused serious damage to the LIVING CREATURES in her care.  While it sucks that you had to be the whistleblower, because your boss should have been paying enough attention to notice her dereliction of duty after 2years, you ABSOLUTELY did the correct thing in documenting her neglect and reporting it to your boss.", "I think the animals formerly under her care who now are getting regular meals and clean enclosures were worth it.", "I agree that wage workers don't get undeserved raises and deserve more.\n\nThis isn't a normal job. However, we're talking about animal care. What the sister was doing was animal abuse. In most jobs, your coworkers would be pissed about having to pick up your slack and might not do so eventually because they don't want to do extra work for the same pay.\n\nThis isn't about wages, OP goes on in comments that her sister wouldn't even feed the animals. The sister shouldn't have been in animal care and should have been fired way before this.", "Idk, I don't like snitches either, but if you don't wanna get snitched on for animal abuse, just don't abuse animals.", "OP works in animal care, and that field doesn't work like other jobs. If the sister isn't stocking shelves, that's one thing, but according to comments from OP, her sister wasn't feeding the animals they're supposed to care for.\n\nHonestly, that goes from laziness and not doing your job to animal neglect. That whole place could have been shut down, everyone lost their jobs, and the animals would have needed to be relocated or put down.", "What OP's sister was doing was animal abuse. According to the comments, OP had reported this before, but she was able to talk her way out of it since there wasn't any evidence.", "Family ties be damned, animal abuse is bad. You really breezed past the part where they're working in animal care, and the sister is neglecting animals in their care.\n\n\"Your parents must be ashamed.\" If this were my kid, I'd be damn proud of them. If I had a kid who acted like OP's sister, I'd think I failed as a parent.", "IT'S LIVING BEINGS. You don't be mediocre or lazy or half ass when you are in charge of taking care of other lives. It's the sister's own damn fault she's in \"poverty\" for not doing her damn job. The worst thing that could happen is an animal gets sick or dies. Do you condone that?", "What you're describing isn't family values, it's called being an enabler. When I start a family, part of our values will be to always take good care of animals and that bad behavior has consequences.", "Her job was literally animal care. If you're gonna act like the sister having a job is more important than animals being alive, then she shouldn't have had a job requiring her to take care of animals.", "\"Stay in your lane\"\n\nMate, this was animal neglect. Stay in your lane is when it doesn't affect you. This is animal care, it is OP's lane. It's literally OP's job. If the neglect continued, then the place would get shut down. So the options are: do the work for two people while not getting more pay, report it with evidence so something is done about it, or let it happen and everyone loses their jobs and the animals either get relocated or put down.\n\nWhich was the best option?", "The post two posts up is saying that even documenting is overstepping.", "Case in point", "NTA\n\nThreatening to turn your friends after you've been covering for them? Lol, fuck around and find out.", "Nta she was bad at her job and the animals deserve better", "Yep, OP's the asshole. So is the sister for lying and neglecting the animals. ESH. Just because she didn't do anything earlier, she didn't need to start at Defcon 5. It's never a good idea to make your opening gambit blackmail and illegal surveillance. That's a federal offense in some states (and in Canada). So, yeah, don't do that. I'm seriously hoping you're both kids because this is all terrible.", "NTA op and I assume you recorded not your sister necessarily but the state of the animals and cages after she 'finished' her tasks.", "I imagine that she is documenting that her sister hadn\u2019t completed the assigned tasks - ie a video of the animals not fed or their enclosures not cleaned. Not a video of the sister which wouldn\u2019t prove anything.", ">federal offense\n\n>in some states\n\nFor the love of god just don't say anything if you don't know what you're talking about", ">Humans are a bit more important than animals.\n\nyeah when it comes life and death, like to who to save in a burning house. Not when her job is to care for these animals and she;s literally neglecting them.", "Actually, I was wrong. It's all states. \"The Federal Wiretap Act\n\nIn response to the public outcry about the government's covert recording of the activities of political activist groups in the 1960s, Congress enacted the Wiretap Act as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510.)\n\nIllegal Recording Under the Wiretap Act\n\nUnder the federal Wiretap Act, it is illegal for any person to secretly record an oral, telephonic, or electronic communication that other parties to the communication reasonably expect to be private. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511.)\" This doesn't include police or government agents, but she is neither.\n\nAlso in Canada. There are too many subsections to list here, but I doubt you care anyway, lol.", "That law doesn't apply here for at least 2 reasons, the main one being that none of this behavior could reasonably be expected to be private. She was at work, around other employees, in areas which should have security cameras. You may have a point if OP recorded someone on their phone in their private bedroom or was recording in a bathroom, but there was NO reasonable expectation of privacy here. Don't play lawyer if you don't understand what you're talking about", "If course it is. She's talking to her sister in a location where she doesn't expect to be surveilled. If there are surveillance cameras at all, they would be on entrances and the drug cabinet. Your argument you mean that there's no expectation of privacy outside bedrooms and bathrooms, which even ignoring how bizarre that would be, the expense alone is unfeasible. People aren't recorded every minute at work. She wasn't recorded on work equipment either, she was recorded by her sister, with whom she has an expectation of privacy.", "The update made this so much more savage!!!", "The animals were missing meals, walks and had dirty cages, this is neglect and animal abuse. By your logic documenting children being abused when you're not a mandated reporter is overstepping. Are you still going to stand by that take?\n\nBut sure, actually caring about the well being of animals who depend on workers to fulfil their needs is baddddd. Shame on OP, she should have turned a blind eye and let this go on until an animal got really sick or an adoptee noticed the horrible conditions the animals are kept in & escalated the issue even further.", "When you\u2019re working with someone who\u2019s always slacking and you always have to take on extra work to make up for their shortfalls, recording how often it happens is precisely the right way of managing your side of the issue. It\u2019s proving that you\u2019re taking on more than your share of responsibilities.\n\nShould OP have made a complaint before this key point, yes, but gathering 2 months evidence is baseline to prove an ongoing issue. Should the supervisor have given warning and put the other employee on a remedial schedule instead of jumping straight to firing them, maybe. It would have been fair to give the sister a warning and another chance. But the supervisor\u2019s reaction is not OP\u2019s responsibility. We don\u2019t know how much due diligence about informing and reminding staff about preventing potential animal welfare and abuse issues was carried out over the course of the recording period and before, but in these circumstances negligence of duty is a serious matter.\n\nBottom line, the sister lost her job because she wasn\u2019t doing the work but manipulating the supervisor into thinking she was deserving of a raise. Nobody wants to work with someone who doesn\u2019t pull their weight and everyone resents the person who gets rewarded despite slacking. I don\u2019t think OP will get any comeback from other employees for using a valid workplace method for exposing the deadweight who was probably making more people than just herself have to work harder.", "So it took 2 months not 2 weeks or even a month?"]}
