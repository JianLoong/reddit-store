I told him not to as I have my extra study classes and would be busy he said okay.\n\nBetween my class that guy was constantly calling me despite telling him not and my teacher scolded me for not paying attention.\n\nI called him back and told him that I would be giving him low rating (earlier I was going to give him a 5) as he constantly disturbed me.

I'm glad you explained how calling all the time is in fact achieving the opposite result from what he was going for. NTA.", "You should have given him a 1 and stated he is harassing people.

This is highly inappropriate behavior.", "NTA - I get that he's concerned about his CS rating, but if someone says \"please don't call me to remind me, I've got a super busy day\" and he calls anyway, that's a bit too pushy for my tastes", "NTA.\n\nReminding a customer at drop off about surveys is mildly annoying but appropriate.\n\nBeing pushy about it, following up with calls and texts and generally being pushy about it really is not ok.\n\nTrying to Shane a customer for giving you bad feedback is not only unacceptable but it is contrary to the entire point of feedback (I.e. to get perspective on what your are doing right or wrong).\n\nFrankly, in your shoes I would likely forward the entire interaction to customer support and complain about that driver harassing you.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s inappropriate. Tell him to stop contacting you or you\u2019re gonna call his boss. He deserved a 1 star rating, not 3.", "NTA. Just taking his money? That's literally his job, you want pizza, he wants money, exchange is done.  \nThe rating is optional and he has no business terrorizing you for one. That's not what your phone number ist for.  \n\n\nGive him a 1/5 and search for another pizza joint. Never trust your foodmaker if he's unhappy with you.", "NTA. Rating is optional. \nBy calling you all the time makes it harassment. Report them to their boss.", "NTA. He harassed you, which is inappropriate and probably against the rules of his employer. I'd report him.", "Bro I\u2019d have given a 1", "NTA\n\ncall the store and let them know.\n\nThe driver is TA for harassing you, but some companies make a huge deal out of these ratings and tie them to pay or bonuses.  I can see where someone with social awareness issues or learning issues could misinterpret and take this to the extreme.  If this company pushes employees hard for ratings, then they are TA too.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have given him a 3/5. He doesn't deserve even that.
