She has always been spoiled by our parents and expects everyone to cater to her whims. She is also very materialistic and loves to show off her expensive things.\r  \n\r  \nShe asked me to be her maid of honor, which I agreed to, even though we are not very close. I thought it would be a nice gesture and a way to bond with her. However, she has been a nightmare ever since. She has made me do all the planning and organizing for her bridal shower, bachelorette party, and wedding day. She has also been very demanding and rude to me and the other bridesmaids. She has criticized our outfits, hairstyles, makeup, and accessories. She has also made us pay for everything, from the invitations to the decorations to the food and drinks.\r  \n\r  \nThe final straw was when she asked me to pay for her wedding dress. She had already picked out a dress that cost $10,000, which was way over her budget. She said she fell in love with it and had to have it. She asked our parents to pay for it, but they refused. They said they had already given her enough money for the wedding and that she should stick to her budget. She then asked me to pay for it, saying that I owed her for being such a bad sister all these years. She said that I had always been jealous of her and that I should be happy for her for once. She also said that I had a good job and could afford it.\r  \n\r  \nI was shocked and angry. I told her that I was not going to pay for her dress and that she was being unreasonable and entitled. I said that she should be grateful for what she had and that she should find a dress that fit her budget. I also said that I was done with being her maid of honor and that I was not going to attend her wedding.\r  \n\r  \nShe threw a tantrum and called me a selfish bitch.
