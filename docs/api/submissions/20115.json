You know when you walk into someone\u2019s home and you know they have a dog and cat, hairballs from the dog so big I had to pick them up by hand before I could vacuum. The dog kennel had so much hair in it two blankets were matted together with hair. \n\nI\u2019m lucky enough to have a Dyson vacuum and so i decided to just vacuum, one thing lead to another and I have dusted, washed, and cleaned most of the surfaces in the living room. I still have work to do but my vacuum battery died and I\u2019m waiting on some pet stuff to come out of the washer/dryer. \n\nSo far with all the cleaning I have done I have dumped the canister 8 times and the air quality is noticeably better. I have not gone though any of their stuff just put things away and overall treated it as if I was a professional cleaner in a strangers home. \n\nHowever I worry that they may take my kind gesture and misconstrue it as me saying they can\u2019t keep a home. I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t feel like they should keep a cleaner home, having 6 nieces myself I know kids need a clean environment especially as they start to walk and toddle, as their kids are doing. And if I\u2019m being completely honest if I was judging just on the house alone I would expect it to be two 18 year old boys living without the parents around \n\nAs they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions and I just want to know, did I fuck up?\n\nEdit: to address some common questions \n\nHow close are we? \n\n>I\u2019ve known them for all 3 years they have lived here, have regular game nights with them, we\u2019ll have dinner and each others places, had multiple parties and taken care of them and their friends when they have had too much, being all around the same age I\u2019ve been told to come around anytime and have helped with many home projects\n\n\nHow much did you clean? \n\n>Just what you can see, I didn\u2019t open boxes, drawers, or bags.
