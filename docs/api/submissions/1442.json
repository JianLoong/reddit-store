My oldest kiddo Jay is 8 and dressed up as Ash from Pok\u00e9mon and our younger kids where Pok\u00e9mon.  Mick told my son his costume was for babies. Mick was eating candy and Jay called Mick a baby for eating candy.  Mick started yelling at my kid telling him no more video games and obviously I don\u2019t give a \ud83d\udca9 what Mick thinks. So I told him to go home. He said he drove my grandma and I said someone else would take grandma home later. After discussing things with my sister (she host Christmas while I host thanksgiving) it was decided Mick is not spending the holidays with us since he thinks it\u2019s ok to bully children. My grandma is upset but I\u2019m not having him at my house again and my grandma\u2019s place is tiny. \n\nMy grandma is upset and Mick is posting all over his social media how snobby my family is and how we make him feel unwelcome as a family.

He also needs to not do it again and maybe get help with his bullying behavior.", "NTA. it is your house and your rules. You don't have to justify your reasoning to anyone. Stepping in and protecting your kid is the most important thing. Don't concern yourself with what Mick thinks or what he spouts on social media. You witnessed how he acted and mistreated your family.
