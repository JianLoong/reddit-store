I make substantially more than I did previously, not enough that I'm going to make any lifestyle changes but enough that I'm more comfortable.  \n\nMy friends know about the job, not what I make.  \n\nMy friend Sally has taken it upon herself to start buying things for me, without asking and expecting me to pay her back. \n\nA month or 2 ago she got me a coffee mug and said she seen it and thought I'd like it. Then a little while later said \"yea so you owe me 15 for the mug\". Ok no big deal.  I paid her. \n\nThen a couple weeks later it was some sour candy she seen at some specialty store or something.  That was 8. \n\nIt's just a few things here and there so I said, hey at least ask me before you get something. \n\nWell then she had a get together at her house.  She asked what kinda chips I wanted. I told her,  I assumed she asked everyone their favorites or something.  \n\nWell then during the get together she said I owed her 3.50 for the chips.  I asked if she was charging everyone.  She said no but I requested these. I said \"okay so I'll take them with when I leave\". She said \"well no. Blah will eat them, he likes them too\". I said \"well if I'm paying for them, then they're mine \". She said \"it's kinda weird to go to a party and take chips home\".  I said \"well if I'm paying you for them, I'm not paying for a whole bag when I ate a handful if you're not even letting me take the bag home\". \n\n\nIt sorta bugs me because if I see something a friend would like I just buy it and give it to them.  Maybe she figured out I'm doing better, but it's just weird.  \n\nSally got another friend involved and she said that Sally was trying to be nice and I should just reimburse her. That I'm being petty over some chips.  \n\nMy thing is it's like Sally wants the credit for \"giving \" but doesn't want to actually give anything.

A gift is something that is meant to be given with no expectation. I would stop hanging out with this friend, or if you wanna be petty, start charging her for gifts.", "NTA that's weird behavior.

In the future, I just wouldn't accept anything from her, since you've already asked her not to buy things for you.", "How much we guessing you paid $3.50 for chips that cost her $2 tops.

If Sally is a decent person other than this absolutely irrational behavior, then it might be worth paying her the $3.50 but saying that you won't be paying her again for stuff she hasn't explicitly cleared with you before purchasing.

I wouldnt really consider osmeone like that afriend tbh. Its really weird. Ive never seen something like that before.", "NTA, and in fact, I would wonder about how much \u2018tax\u2019 she adds to the price. Wtf wants a $15 mug?! She might have gotten that at the thrift store.", "NTA. She's not doing you a favor. Perhaps a \"No thank you.\" and if she continues \"I didn't ask for that nor do I want it.
