Your sister will have to cope for a few days and explain the toy is on holiday with you, and it's coming back with photos and a present! \n\nYour privacy is more important long term than a few days without a toy. It's hard own fault, not for leaving the toy - mistakes happen - but for having a poor track record with respect. Maybe she'll reflect on that over the weekend.", "NTA\n\nI find it suspicious that the absence of the toy was not noticed until you were gone. Unless your nephew was picked up from your apartment right before you left for your trip, I would assume he would have missed the toy that same day.\n\nEdit: sorry for commenting twice.

You're under no obligation to show anyone into your home if you don't want to. Period.", "NTA That's a \"no\" then. Tell them you're done discussing it until you get home and ignore further calls. You can deal with it ASAP when you get home, maybe that will help calm people down.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re under no obligation to allow someone you don\u2019t trust to violate your personal space. Are you sure the toy is even at your apartment? I could be reaching here, but if your sister has a pattern of snooping through your stuff, she could be lying about it as an excuse to get in while you\u2019re gone. Unless you left for your trip the same day your nephew was at your home, it seems suspicious that the toy\u2019s absence wasn\u2019t noticed until you were out of town. If it\u2019s as important as she says, I would assume the nephew would have pitched a fit that day.\n\nI feel bad for your nephew, but this is a situation that your sister needs to be prepared to deal with. Toys get lost or destroyed all the time, and it really sucks for a kid who is neurodivergent because they don\u2019t know how to process the loss of their comfort object, but it\u2019s an unfortunate part of life.", "Nta.

If you're feeling generous, you could ask your sister to be on video call with you while she looks for the toy (and until she leaves your apartment), then change the code after she leaves. If not, your sister and nephew will survive.", "NTA and I think if I was op my phone would suddenly loose service. \n\nI honestly get it.

If you give her that kind of power over your belongings, you will never know peace of mind.\n\nAs for the toy, that was your sister's responsibility.

If that toy is his touch object for comfort when things are too much, he needs that toy.\n\nAutism sucks and you don't know what issues the child has,  but you know there are doctors involved,  so let's presume this child has a serious need for  this particular toy. Equate this toy with insulin or other medication that cannot be easily replaced.\n\nFind a solution, though it doesn't have to be *that* solution. Give the code to someone you do trust to ignore your clutter, and ignore your stuff and not snoop. This person can get the toy. Please.  For the sake of the kid. You say there is no one you trust, so. Maybe it's a pair of someone's who will keep each other honest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So the toy to be as important as she says it is, to walk out without it, drive in the car, and have enough time pass for OP to leave the area, is pretty far fetched.

A lot of people forget things. Important things. I can go years without remembering something, only to be reminded of it and feel horrible for ever forgetting. Some of the most important things in my life are lost in the dark swirl of my mind, and i may never get them back. ADHD, early onset dementia, Alzheimer's, DID...

My mom went to like ten stores to find it and she bought 4 copies. I was very attached to it specifically and she knew I wouldn\u2019t accept another copy of it, so she ruffed him up in some snow and a lil bit of dirt and clipped the felt wing exactly how mine had gotten a tear. She came home and said she found him in the snowbank outside the house. Thank you for reminding me of this memory.", "While this is a good idea, it's not anyways possible. My oldest became super attached to a stuffed monkey when she was 3, and she carried that thing around for the next four or five years. The problem was, the monkey had been purchased at a zoo gift shop for her when she was six months old. I couldn't find a duplicate by the time she became attached. She lost him one time for a week, and she sobbed herself to sleep at night every night. It was a really rough week.\n\nThat being said, OP is NTA for refusing. They don't owe anyone access to the home.", "What a sweet story! Thank you for sharing.   \n\n\nWhen I was a kid, our brother had an affinity for a stuffed Sesame Street character doll... or more specifically, like many kids do, the tag. That tag was nice and silky and don't think my mother didn't neatly pick out the stitches on the stuffy's side and surreptitiously replace the tags when they were worn with a similar silky ribbon. Thanks for helping me recall a nice memory too."]}
