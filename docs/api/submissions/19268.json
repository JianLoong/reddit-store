I\u2019m not a monster so i\u2019m not upset another group is playing with it. However, when I noticed ALL of the chalk was opened and being played with i got extremely upset. Once again I only wanted a certain amount open so it doesn\u2019t get used up too fast. I ask my co worker \u201cHarvey\u201d (30m) if he opened the rest of the packs of chalk and he says no that his kids in his group did. Harvey has a history of lying when being confronted so I went and asked the kids in his group if they played with the chalk and they said \u201cYes. Mr.Harvey opened it up for us\u201d.
