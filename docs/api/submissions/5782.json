They\u2019ve moved in together quickly because Tim had to move out of his house because his landlord was selling and he asked Claire if he could move in. She\u2019s in love so obviously said yes.\n\nThe thing about it Claire is that over lockdowns, she was laid off and started her own business which blew up and continued to grow. I know for a fact that she makes a lot of money. We\u2019re talking well into 6 digits of what she\u2019s bringing home which is quite high in the UK, way more than most people earn.\n\nAnyway, Tim was over the other day and he started complaining how he\u2019s short of cash and can\u2019t help with bills again this month (he\u2019s got a teeny gambling problem that he\u2019s working on but Claire doesn\u2019t know because he\u2019s handling it) but Claire doesn\u2019t want to pay 100% anymore because it\u2019s the 3rd time. She doesn\u2019t live in a luxury house, their bills are not high.\n\nI told him that I love her to bits but she\u2019s being a penny pinching bitch because she can afford to help out and not even notice it.\n\nTim asked what I meant and I told him that she had a successful business. He was shocked because she downplayed her success a lot and don\u2019t tell him that she\u2019s basically rich.\n\nHe was really sad and went home. In the morning, Claire called me and told me thag she\u2019ll never share anything with me ever again. That I had no right to tell Tim how much she makes and that it\u2019s really ahittt how I conveniently forgot to tell her about his gambling problem (no idea how she found out, Tim didn\u2019t tell her). She\u2019s fuming with me. I spoke with Tim and they had an argument about bills again and he basically told her about our conversation and told her she\u2019s heartless. She kicked him out and he\u2019s now staying on our couch.\n\nI do feel bad, he still would have a place to live if I hadn\u2019t told him and I feel like an asshole. But then again he had a right to know. I\u2019m conflicted.

I hate when people are like \"you make good money so why not just pay for everything, or give me some\". They have not been together long, he has a gambling addiction you are playing into (And she doesn't even know about????)", "My you are a nasty person. You came here to pretend you did not know what you were doing in telling Tim what she earns but not telling her about his addiction. Are you jealous of her or the fact that you think they are in love or are you just a sh-t stirrer?? YTA. Worst kind of a friend to both of them", "INFO:  Do you even like Claire?", "YTA - nobody owes anyone to pay their bills whether they would \"feel it\" or not. You and Tim both suck.", "YTA\n\nHow can you not see that?\n\n1) you shared someone's salary information \n\n2) you shared Claire's salary info with Tom, but didn't share Tom's gambling addiction with Claire. \n\n3) called Claire names for not sharing her money.", "YTA\n\nHow Claire decides to share, or not share her money is her business.  If she can afford to support someone with a gambling problem (there is no such thing as a small gambling problem) is HER business and not yours.  \n\nI'm glad she dumped him.  She should have dumped him.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not your business to discuss your friend's income with her significant other.  That's up to Claire to decide what she tells Tim, and when she tells him.  Tim should have been honest with Clair about his gambling habit, but you didn't say anything to her about that.   You just threw Claire under the bus here.\n\nAlso, if Tim can't pay his share of the bills because of a gambling problem, he's definitely not handling or working on the problem and it's not \"teeny.\"  It's affecting his ability to pay his living expenses.  Once could be excused, but three times?  \n\nWhy should Claire be expected to foot all of the household expenses while Tim gets a pass?\n\nClair was laid off from her job during lockdown, and obviously worked her butt off to make a success of her business.  Of course she's going to be concerned about being able to pay her expenses and to support herself.  She lives reasonably and doesn't overspend.  Claire is likely saving in case she has a future emergency and can't work.  She sounds like she is financially savvy.  Claire isn't obligated to support Tim in any way.\n\nYou owe Claire an apology.  She probably won't accept it though.", "YTA but she shouldn\u2019t have trusted you with that info in the first place", "So he has a right to know about Claire\u2019s finances, but you don\u2019t think Claire has a right to know about his gambling problem?

She could be a billionaire and buddy still gotta buck up and pay his fair share. He really needs to kick that stupid ass habit and get this girl that loves him to trust him by being trustworthy.", "YTA and Tim should stay on your couch forever. That was not your business to tell and that makes you a big AH because what it really sounds like is that you are jealous and trying to create fiction for your friend. They are gf/bf not married so her finances are her business.", "What the hell is wrong with you??\n\nThey've only been together a few months and you expect her to cover all of his expenses because he has a gambling problem that he's been hiding from her and you think SHE is the bad guy? He is not entitled to any of her money. I hope she dumps his ass and dumps you guys as friends. I wish her all the best in her business.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nWhy did you feel that it was important for him to know about her finances yet his gambling problem was somebow not Claire's business?", "This is so bad it has to be fake.", "YTA \n\nHe has a \u201cteeny gambling addiction\u201d??

If it\u2019s the same person, YTA. If it\u2019s not, you\u2019re still the asshole if it\u2019s real.", "YTA. No, he did NOT \"have a right to know\" her financial situation. SHE had a right to let him know only as much as she was comfortable with. You took away that right. Not to mention that you betrayed her confidence. \n\nAnd I think she actually did have a right to know about his gambling addiction, since it's something he might not always have control of. \n\nBig mistake here, OP.", "YTA. Sure she has a successful business but you have no clue how much of that money goes into said business. After her expenses and paying 100% of the bills she may well be broke. \n\nAlso why is it ok for him to be out of money and to have a gambling problem?!", "YTA and Tim is using Claire.  She is not his wife or his mother.  He is an adult wasting his money on gambling.  I bet Tim was evicted for not paying rent.  There is no such thing as a teeny gambling problem.    Claire does not have to allow herself to be used so badly.\n\nI would also say we do not get to see karma so quickly- now he is your problem.  I hope losing your friend and gaining a leech with a gambling problem was worth it.  Update us in a few months when he is still there and depending on you to take care of him because of his teeny gambling problem.  I couldn't see a better outcome!  You actually did her a HUGE favor!  She should send you a thank you basket.", "YTA. 1\u2014it\u2019s none of your business. 2\u2014why would you call HER names for not wanting to continually pay for her freeloading gambler bf? You don\u2019t sound like a friend at all.", "BIG YTA!", "yta. so he deserves to know about her money but she does not deserve to know about his gambling? you are a shity friend, thankfully she kick him to the curb and hopefully will cut ties with you too.", "Yta. Also I doubt his landlord kicked him out purely cos they were selling the house, sounds like the Tim couldn't pay his bills", "Since you care so much for Tim I'm sure you don't have an issue letting him live at your place without contributing to expenses. In fact you sound like such a good friend, I can see you lending him money since you trust him so much and are sure his gambling problem isn't so serious so you don't have to worry that he will gamble it away./s \n\nObviously YTA and jealous. Now you have to live with the consequences of your own actions.", "Yta", "Good luck paying for your freeloading friend with a gambling problem.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, but you\u2019ve done Claire a favour. What man of his age can\u2019t afford to contribute to bills. If he has a fulltime job, it\u2019s clearly not a tiny gambling problem is it?\nBy dropping your \u2018friend\u2019 in it, you\u2019ve saved her financially from a lifetime of disappointment from your loser friend. Maybe this will be the wake up call he needs to sort his shit out permanently. \nHopefully Claire hasn\u2019t added him to any of her shit because if he\u2019s got debt it will be hers and your homes they come knocking at.", "YTA don't interfere in others relationships. \n\nYou mention her wealth to him, but fail to mention his \"teeny\" gambling problem to her. That's a pretty shitty thing to do to both of them actually.", "YTA. they've only been seeing each other for a few months. She doesn't need to disclose her financial details to him. You shouldn't be sticking your nose in", "I didn't understand... I thought Claire said she was short on cash since you wrote \n\n>Anyway, Tim was over the other day and he started complaining how she\u2019s short of cash and can\u2019t help with bills again this month (he\u2019s got a teeny gambling problem that he\u2019s working on but Claire doesn\u2019t know because he\u2019s handling it) but flair doesn\u2019t want to pay 100% anymore because it\u2019s the 3rd time. She doesn\u2019t live in a luxury house, their bills are not high.\n\nBut now that I understand you meant Tim and that Claire was the one having to pay 100% three times already, You're definitely the AH. No matter how successful Claire is, she's not gonna take responsibility of off Tim and fuel his addiction by financially provide for him.", "YTA\n\nAnd Tim can live with you and you can help him with his tiny gambling addiction", "Funny how you gloss over his gambling problems, while making his girlfriend look bad. YTA.", "YTA. He is hiding a gambling problem and can\u2019t make bills. He has a problem and it isn\u2019t up to Clair to give him anymore. And I hate to tell you this but you\u2019re a crappy friend for saying Clair is cheap, I\u2019d be cheap too if my bf keeps coming up short for bills.", "YTA\n\nHow many ways?\n\nHer finances are her business. \n\nWhen you share that information with a SO is also her business. \n\nTim\u2019s an adult and responsible for his own bills. \n\nYou interjecting into their relationship caused the breakup.", "YTA it was not your place to share this information plus you\u2019re condescending and calling your friend names. She\u2019s better off not being your friend and you go help Tim with his \u201cteeny\u201d gambling problem.", "YTA. He 100% does NOT have the right to her financial information, and it was 100% NOT your place to tell him anything. If she wanted him to know she would tell him. You had no right sticking your nose into their relationship. If someone revealed personal details about you to your spouse that you had kept private for your own reasons, honestly say you wouldn\u2019t be livid. And isn\u2019t it just so interesting that you seem to think he had a right to her money, but she didn\u2019t have a right to know he has a gambling problem\u2026Also, your friend has a gambling problem and you thought it a good idea to tell him that his new GF is rich and should be providing him more? That he\u2019s entitled to her money? He deserved to be dumped and quite frankly you deserve it to after being such a shitty friend to both of them. Apologize to both of them and learn to mind your own business in the future.", "YTA. It is nice of you to let karma, I mean Tim, use your couch tho. How long you think you're gonna last with his \"teeny gambling problem that he's (totally) working on\"? Three months with him drinking your beer, eating your food, watching your tv, not having enough to get out because reasons?", "YTA. You shouldn't have gotten involved at all. Your friend is well within her rights to be upset with you.", "YTA. Not that anything is your business but if you had to involve yourself, you should have let your \u201cfriend\u201d know he has a \u2018teeny gambling problem\u2019", "YTA.  \n\nThere is no such thing as a \u201c*teeny gambling problem*\u201d and he is not handling it as the fact he once again can\u2019t cover his bills proves.\n\nHave you considered Tim may have lied about why he had to abruptly leave his last place?  That maybe it could be due to his \u201c*teeny gambling problem*\u201d?  Landlords like to be paid rent, gambling addicts prefer to use their money to gamble.  You admit Tim regularly has trouble covering his bills.  You seeing how those things may be linked?\n\nIn your conversation with Claire she dragged you for forgetting to mention Tim\u2019s gambling addiction.  This means she was aware of it and more than likely factored that into her decision not to financially help him.  \n\nThe most alarming part is you just told a gambling addict that he has access to a large source of money to gamble.  You may live to regret that as addicts can become very unpredictable when something is standing in their way and they need to feed their addiction. You may have just put Claire in harm\u2019s way.", "YTA - This is an absolute AH move. It's not your place to tell other people how much someone earns, that's private. Honestly someone like you did this to me I'd cut you off in a heartbeat. So not any of your business.\n\nAlso if he is living with her and blind to her success the more fool him also .", "YTA. You told your gambling addict friend he hit the jackpot and used her earnings to try and sabotage her attempt to draw good boundaries. I hope she kicks him out soon", "YTA.  What on earth were you thinking?  You broke your friend's confidence.  And you expect her to support this freeloading dude, when they've only been dating for a few month?\n\nShe has every right to wait to disclose how much she makes.  You have no idea what else she is spending her money on.  Maybe she needs to make an investment in her business or a family member needs help.  \n\nAlso, there is no such thing as a \"teeny\" gambling problem.  I'm shocked you would let *your friend* be blindsided by something like that and, essentially, let him siphon her money down the rabbit hole of his addiction.  Are you sure you actually like Claire?  Because, honestly, it doesn't sound like it.", "YTA - ok to give her financial info out while he's got gambling debt.  He's obviously not \"handling\" his problem since he cannot pay his bills and you enabled that but thought it ok for your friend to become his enabler?", "YTA. This is **none** of your business, you should\u2019ve stayed out of it. She is not obligated to pay for his gambling problem. He needs to sort himself out on his own.\n\nStop trying to spend other people\u2019s money.", "YTA. It's not your business. Further if \"he had a right to know\" about HER financial status, SHE had a right to know about his (the gambling problem). Regardless - neither of those things are YOUR business", "YTA - Her finances and what she does or does not choose to do with them are none of your business, so you had no right to share that information. There's also no such thing as a 'teeny' gambling problem. You're either a gambling addict or you're not, and there's only one person responsible for sorting out that mess - the addict themselves.", "She\u2019s been paying all his bills for 3 months? and he was living in her home rent free? YTA and Claire is a saint!", "Yeah, YTA. So is Tim. How much she makes and what she spends it on is not your business, and it's certainly not your business to share without permission. Seriously, would you want a boyfriend with a \"tiny\" gambling addiction mooching off you for bills they can't pay? And then find out your friend had been talking shit about you behind your back with this person, and sharing your income information? \n\nSeriously hope Claire gets out of this whole mess, sounds like she deserves better than both of you in her life.", "Yta, why should Claire have to continue to pay 100% of the bills to support his gambling addiction - that she didn\u2019t even know about- that you say \u201che\u2019s handling\u201d but how well can he really be handling it if Claire has been paying his bills for three months and he\u2019s still broke? When she met him he was losing his house so he was essentially homeless. She was smart not to tell him about her finances, she was protecting herself. None of this was your business and you\u2019re wrong to think that she should have to pay his way in life just because she can afford to.", "YTA- WOW!  This was absolutely none of your business to share anything with Tim. A \u201cteeny gambling problem that he has under control\u201d? Obviously not, or he\u2019s be able to pay his share of the cheap bills. \n\nYou have overstepped so far here it\u2019s embarrassing. You don\u2019t have a fucking clue what goes on on their relationship ship. If I were Claire, I\u2019d give a lot of thought whether I wanted to continue a friendship with you. Unbelievable.", "Yta", "You got one side of the story... HIS. Second, it's her home and he's living there. You do not know what financial arrangements were made between them prior to him moving in with her. Also, Claire may be making a lot of money, but how much is she spending to put into the business - this is not something you know. You also don't know her personal expenses or debts. I'm wondering if it ever occurred to you that Claire found out about his gambling problem and that's why she was tight lipped about it and not ready to offer up more... because she knows something you don't? Like maybe he isn't paying into the household as much as he says he is, and maybe she does know if she offers more money, it's going towards his gambling problem or his gambling debt. Based on how betrayed she felt by you sharing her info with him but you never told her about his problem.... I'm going with the latter here.   \n\n\nYTA because you shouldn't be sharing ANY personal information, especially financial. I wouldn't share anything remotely personal with you anymore either. You're untrustworthy.", "YTA.  \n that's not your business, period.", "YTA and a terrible friend but somehow it worked out because it helped Claire see the light that Tim is an immature mooch who has a gambling problem. \n\nSo he had a \"right to know\" about Claire's financial status but she didn't have a right to know about his gambling issue? Of the two, the one you should disclose is the gambling problem because that is a relationship/marriage killer. \n\nJust admit you are jealous of Claire and in your pettiness you torpedoed the relationship, but again thank you for helping Claire out of that terrible situation even if it wasn't your true intent.", "YTA", "YTA - Tim should have his life at least semi-sorted by this age. Claire shouldn\u2019t be carrying a man any the rest of her life.", "YTA. Why should she have to fund his gambling problem just because she makes more money? Why do you think it is your place to use her money to to help him fund HIS problem? You are a terrible friend to both of them.", "How does your husband feel about you succing tim\u2019s dicc so hard ?", "YTA and an enabler for Tim\u2019s addiction. Just wait till he tries to scrounge off you", "YTA. Why would you discuss another person finances. Even if she does make a lot, that doesn't mean she needs to constantly support another human being who is not her child. Its not like this is the first time he has done this. She has even less reason to support him if he has a gambling problem that you didn't think she needs to know about. It doesn't sound like she's your friend at all. The way I see it, her money will not affect anyone negatively, but his gambling issues can have a negative effect on her. How dare you call her a penny pinching bitch? I hope she cuts you out of her life.", "YTA.  It wasn't your business.  Maybe a small hint to get him looking in the right direction.  He's probably better off without her.", "Claire is not your friend. A friend doesn't dismiss their friend's partner's addiction which will have a detrimental effect on her finances. Of course she kicked him out. He's a mooch. \n\nYTA", "YTA, it\u2019s not your place to share your friends financial information with a dude she\u2019s only known for a few months.\n\nAnd also, if his gambling problem is bad enough to where he can\u2019t pay the bills for the third month in a row then it isn\u2019t a \u201cteeny\u201d problem. Be a better friend.", "Info: Are you going to tell Tim all your financial information now that he's freeloading off of you and not Claire? He has a right to know, afterall!", "YTA and a terrible friend to Claire.  You're OK sharing private information about Claire with Tim so he'll have more ammunition to try to bully her into subsidizing his life which includes his teensy weensy gambling problem.  But you don't share with Claire about the gambling.  How does Tim have a right to Claire's private financial information but Claire not have a right to know that she's hooking up with a financially exploitive addict?  (Although, I guess she figured out the financially exploitive part.)\n\nClaire is the only person in this scenario who isn't an A.  How is a woman not 100 per cent supporting her BF a penny pinching bitch or heartless?  Why isn't Tim, a grown man, not working and supporting himself?  Why should Claire put up with a BF like this?  Maybe her kicking him out will be a wakeup call and he'll get off your couch and get his life in order. Or maybe not, since as a not-bitchy, not-heartless person, you'll let him stay there forever without making any contribution to your household.  \n\nI really hope you see the problem and don't keep enabling Tim.", "YTA So glad she kicked out that freeloader. I really hope she blocks you too.", "YTA - You're way over the line. It's not even close to your place to disclose financial information about someone else without their consent.\n\nPlus, her income is irrelevant to the situation. No matter how much she makes it doesn't obligate her to pay someone else's bills.", "E-S-H. Tim for not coming clean about is gambling problem, Claire for not contributing to the bills when she was able, and you for meddling with peoples lives\n\nEdit: I misread and apparently its Tim not contributing for the bills. Therefore YTA for thinking tim deserves to not contribute for any reason and Tim\u2019s the asshole for the same. Good for Claire for kicking him out", "YTA. Do you even like Claire? The tone of your post screams that you don\u2019t. You call her a penny pincher while totally downplaying his gambling issues. Sounds like you are either extremely jealous of her success or you have a crush on Tim. Either way, you are clearly no friend to Claire. With friends like you, who needs enemies. \n\nAs a side note, most people with addictions downplay them, so his \u201cteeny tiny\u201d gambling addiction is probably MUCH worse than he\u2019s leading on.", "YTA.  It doesn't matter how much money Claire has; she has no obligation to pay the bills of a guy she's only known for a few months who is living in her house for free.\n\nWait and see how you feel when Tim asks you to cover his gambling debts.", "So you think it\u2019s your place to tell Tim (who you call your husbands friend so I assume not as close as Clare who you call your friend) Claire\u2019s business when she clearly hadn\u2019t. But Tims gambling problem (which he does not have \u201cunder control\u201d - dude is contributing nothing) is none of her business.\n\nYou clearly are jealous of Claire\u2019s success and are looking for ways to tear her down. You only feel bad because she kicked Tim out, not for wronging your friend.", "How the fuck is her keeping her successful business to herself (likely because she knows your friend will demand her money) worse than your friend actively hiding his gambling addiction and expecting her to help him out? YTA and so is your friend. She doesn\u2019t owe him anything. He needs to fix himself.", "Esh. Seems like you should have just minded your business here. At the same time, if they\u2019re in a live-in relationship, it\u2019s not very outlandish that he would find out what she makes sooner or later. He\u2019s an ah for being a bum. I, for one, would absolutely not feel comfortable with a problem gambler living in my house. A loan shark or mobster could come after him for his gambling debts one of these days and try to shake you down by association. Any money he saves staying with you is just going to go to the slots/poker/whatever he pisses his money away on, too.\n\nThe one good thing coming from this is that Claire now knows that\u2019s she\u2019s in a relationship with a walking liability, so hopefully she can make a more informed decision about their future together", "YTA.  Holy shit.  Why the fuck should Claire be expected to fund this secret gambling problem? However, it does seem you\u2019ve now made your own bed.  Have fun funding Tim.  I hope it was worth it", "He has a right to know how much she made? But she didn\u2019t have a right to know about your friend\u2019s teeny gambling that cost him his house and why he can\u2019t afford his bills for the third time?\n\nYTA; times a thousand. She didn\u2019t tell him because he\u2019s a user and a mooch and supporting him; gave him a place to stay and three chances to get his act together.

They\u2019ve moved in together quickly because Tim had to move out of his house because his landlord was selling and he asked Claire if he could move in. She\u2019s in love so obviously said yes.\n\nThe thing about it Claire is that over lockdowns, she was laid off and started her own business which blew up and continued to grow. I know for a fact that she makes a lot of money. We\u2019re talking well into 6 digits of what she\u2019s bringing home which is quite high in the UK, way more than most people earn.\n\nAnyway, Tim was over the other day and he started complaining how she\u2019s short of cash and can\u2019t help with bills again this month (he\u2019s got a teeny gambling problem that he\u2019s working on but Claire doesn\u2019t know because he\u2019s handling it) but flair doesn\u2019t want to pay 100% anymore because it\u2019s the 3rd time. She doesn\u2019t live in a luxury house, their bills are not high.\n\nI told him that I love her to bits but she\u2019s being a penny pinching bitch because she can afford to help out and not even notice it.\n\nTim asked what I meant and I told him that she had a successful business. He was shocked because she downplayed her success a lot and don\u2019t tell him that she\u2019s basically rich.\n\nHe was really sad and went home. In the morning, Claire called me and told me thag she\u2019ll never share anything with me ever again. That I had no right to tell Tim how much she makes and that it\u2019s really ahittt how I conveniently forgot to tell her about his gambling problem (no idea how she found out, Tim didn\u2019t tell her). She\u2019s fuming with me. I spoke with Tim and they had an argument about bills again and he basically told her about our conversation and told her she\u2019s heartless. She kicked him out and he\u2019s now staying on our couch.\n\nI do feel bad, he still would have a place to live if I hadn\u2019t told him and I feel like an asshole. But then again he had a right to know. I\u2019m conflicted. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. He doesn't \"have a right to know\" - you made that up. You betrayed your friend's confidence. That makes you an AH.\n\nTim appears to be a wastrel with a gambling problem. He's clearly not \"handling it\" if he doesn't have enough to contribute towards the bills three months out of \"a few months\". Obviously Claire doesn't want Tim to know she has money, because Tim is completely untrustworthy with money, and if he knew Claire had money, he'd likely just view her as an ATM.", "YTA", "YTA - Did it ever occur to you she was lying to you and not Tim? Or that maybe she had noticed missing funds from Tim's paycheck via his gambling addiction and didn't want to fund that?  And BTW that's exactly what you essentially want her to do, fund his addiction you felt was more important to you than her financial well being.\n\nI hope you enjoy housing him and funding his addiction. He's your problem now.", "YTA\n\nYou told something that wasn't yours to tell. It was told to you in confidence and you betrayed that. Bonus AH points for choosing to downplay the gambling habit. Funny how you can pick and choose when people deserve to know other people's business by how it suits you. You don't get to dictate what others share with people whether that is information or money. Something tells me you probably won't have to worry about either from her any time soon. \n\nOn the upside, you inherited the gambling addict house guest, so I guess that's just desserts.", "So, he has a right to know her income BUT she didn't have a right to know about his gambling problem?\n\nYTA you should have stayed out of it.", "YTA- this is what happens why you don\u2019t mind the business that pays you. You\u2019re also greasy for letting her move this man in without warning her of his gambling issues. You\u2019re a bad friend and I wonder if you\u2019re jealous", "YTA you sound like you're jealous she makes more than you (it's obvious I can smell your envy from here) & you're a horrible friend for setting your so called friend up with someone you knew had gambling debts! Even if you didn't know before setting them up you absolutely knew when she called you out on it! & yes you have absolutely no freaking business discussing HER finances with someone that's not her! I'm glad you did one thing right in all this....giving your idiot loser friend ammo to go at her which made her realize you both are trash resulting in her kicking him out! Now you have him & his debts to discuss her for as long as you like since he's on your couch \ud83e\udd23", "There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cteeny gambling problem\u201d. Enjoy the freeloader on your couch. Maybe now you\u2019ll be happy to give him money.", "YTA. He has a gambling problem, that Claire somehow knows about, and then you wonder why your \"potentially rich\" friend didn't want her gambling addicted boyfriend to know about her money? My dude. You don't dangle potential money in front of a gambler. \n\nYour friend's business wasn't yours to share.", "YTA to both your friends.\n\n1. 3 times not being able to pay your bills is not a \"tiny\" gambling problem that he's \"working on.\" That's a large problem that is not being effectively treated. Paying when he comes up short from his gambling is actively harmful to him. (It's called enabling.) This prevents him from experiencing the natural consequences of his actions, which is a necessary part of allowing addicts of all types to eventually overcome their addiction. \n\nAlso, there is never enough money for an active gambling addict. He would run through your other friend's money, your money, every other bit of money he can get his hands on, then run up a massive debt and it still won't be enough unless he stops gambling entirely. That's how gambling addiction works. So, doesn't matter if friend \"could\" help.\n\n2. Sharing financial info is one of the steps of building a relationship. People choose to do that on their own time, for their own reasons. You have no right to interfere with that, especially when revealing a possible significant income difference. \n\nYou also do not know your successful friend's full financial situation, so you can't possibly actually know what she can comfortably afford to support the deadbeat gambling addict", "You couldn\u2019t possibly be a bigger AH! Claire is right, you had no business telling him anything about how much she makes and you\u2019re an absolute hypocrite for thinking that her financials classify as \u201cneeds to be shared\u201d but his gambling ADDICTION doesn\u2019t! YTA and if I were Claire I\u2019d be seriously reevaluating the value of your so-called friendship. She\u2019s supposedly your friend first and foremost, while Tim is your husband\u2019s friend. Why are your loyalties with him?? Methinks you\u2019re jealous of her success.", "So you give him a place to live and cover his bills. My word you\u2019re a garbage friend! YTA and hopefully Claire chucks you both out of her life!", "Wtf ?? Why would you put someone you call a friend in a situation like this ? You new this man had nothing going for himself, no income, a gambling problem and needs someone to take care of him but told your friend none of this ?? Then you tell him how much your friend is making like she\u2019s the selfish one for not wanting to take care of a grown man who is doing nothing to help himself ??  All you\u2019ve done is set your friend up for failure!! \n\nI\u2019m glad she found out about his gambling and everything else and put him out , now he\u2019s your problem to deal with and you can take care of him since it\u2019s so easy. With friends like this who needs enemies now you\u2019ve lost a friend and gained a problem that\u2019s you\u2019ll realize in the long run. YTA and a bad friend.", "ESH. She lied, he lied, you overstepped.", "YTA: tim , your husbands friend, doesn\u2019t want to pay for his share of living expenses. What his partner makes is irrelevant to that want. Why should she pay 100% of the cost for 2 people ?  he has money, he chooses to spend it on other things instead.  You are fine with sharing what your friend makes but you don\u2019t care about her enough to tell her that her partner spends his money on gambling. You aren\u2019t being a good friend.", "Lololol I love how quickly the consequences of your actions came to you because now you\u2019re stuck taking care of his hobosexual gambling addict ass. Congratulations on your new adult-sized baby. Have fun paying his bills, and good luck getting him into a place of his own now that he\u2019s roosting in your living room. \n\nI don\u2019t know what kind of twisted logic you used to justify hiding his gambling problem from her WHILE disclosing her personal financial information to him, but you are a shit friend. If Claire has any sense, she\u2019ll drop all of you users like a hot rock. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t come to her with a hand out already. YTA.", "Yta", "YTA\n\nHe does have a place to leach. Yours.\n\nAlso, he did not have a \"right to know.\"", "YTA They\u2019ve been dating a few months, he didn\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d to know her income. She\u2019s already doing him a favor by letting him move in and covering his expenses for three months. You know he has a gambling problem but you\u2019re keeping it from her while revealing her income to him? You\u2019re a shitty friend and I hope she dumps you both. Good luck having the mooch on your couch indefinitely. What a great start to your marriage.", "YTA. If this isn't the first time she might have guessed Tim has money/gambling problems and she is right putting boundaries. He looks like he's not handling it as well as he thinks.\n\nEspecially since she knows how much bills are and if Tim has not having problems at work its gonna smell fishy. Plus looks like he's lying to her about the gambling bit (I suppose she might have guessed as much).", "I'm going YTA because the reason he can't pay his bills is his gambling problem and when you thought it was ok to put her business out there you didn't feel the need to put his. You way overstepped here.", "YTA - he's clearly not handling his gambling problem. Why did you tell him about her income but not tell her about his gambling?", "You told someone with an active gambling problem that his partner is loaded? You didn't think  that would blow up?\n\nAnd you didn't spill his beans to her?\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nThis is none of your business. He\u2018s keeping his gambling addiction from her. And you insulted her immediately.\n\nYou both suck, but she doesn\u2019t. She\u2018s not obligated to help him out financially, and considering that he\u2018s dishonest as fuck, it\u2018s good that she doesn\u2019t!", "ESH.  Are you all sure you are friends?", "This has already been posted before. The comments obviously aren\u2019t changing.", "YTA. Why should Claire be expected to pay for everything? Why are you standing up for Tim when Claire is your friend? Obviously Claire wasn't telling him about finances for some reason. Why did you feel entitled to divulge her situation?\n\nTim should have had to pay his fair share from the start. What would he have done if he hadn't met Claire?", "YTA\n\nYou got in the middle of a couple\u2019s dispute over finances.  Not sure how it works in the UK, but here in the US that\u2019s a pretty bright line.\n\nI can\u2019t see any way that was possibly going to end with anyone grateful to you for your help.", "YTA. Omg YTA. I\u2019m shocked. There\u2019s probably a reason why Claire didn\u2019t tell Tim how much she made.", "YTA stay out of other peoples business. Period", "YTA YTA YTA YTA\n\nIT'S HER MONEY\n\nHE DOESN'T PAY HIS SHARE, HE GAMBLES INSTEAD \n\nIN WHAT WORLD CAN YOU JUDGE HER WHEN YOU KEPT THAT FROM HER AND THEN SPILLED HER INFO TO HIM??", "YTA. \n\nHe had zero right to know what she earns. It wasn\u2019t your place to butt in. It\u2019s her money and she\u2019s already let him move in after a few months! \n\nBut she DID have a right to know about his \u2018teensy\u2019 addiction - which is a lot more of an issue than him having to pay his own way. \n\nWeird that you\u2019re happier to hide a negative monetary problem than her salary. You\u2019re a terrible friend to Claire.", "YTA. Tim is an adult & needs to stop freeloading off Claire. She's covered the bills for 3 months in row? Claire needs to kick his deadbeat, gambling addicted ass out of her house. She also needs better friends, because you're the worst.", "Info: if Claire is *your* friend, and Tim is *your husband's* friend - why are you trying to enable your husband's friend's gambling addiction and mooching off of your friend at the cost of your friendship?", "YTA. Keep your mouth shut about things that aren\u2019t any of your business. \n\nIf he can\u2019t pay for his bills, he\u2019s not handling his \u201cteeny\u201d gambling problem. He clearly has an addiction that he can\u2019t control. \nLmfao weird that you wouldn\u2019t consider that a problem. \n\nEven weirder is how, you didn\u2019t feel it was right to tell your \u201cfriend\u201d about his gambling addiction, but you can spill her private financial information. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t speak to you ever again.  This is how you set people up to be in financially abusive relationships.  You\u2019re a bad friend.\n\n\nEdit:  Also, this all makes me wonder if Tim\u2019s landlord wasn\u2019t *actually* selling.  Maybe Tim couldn\u2019t pay his rent and OP and hubby set him up with Claire at the wedding because they knew she had money.", "YTA. he has a GAMBLING PROBLEM that is causing him to be able to afford HALF of the bills, but she's the B for asking him to pull his weight and trying to be frugal? Dude. I'm glad she kicked him out and I hope she never speaks to either of you again.", "ESH op had no right to tell him how much Claire made, Tim should have disclosed that he had a gambling problem and Claire should have let Tim know how much she made because if the genders were reversed y\u2019all would\u2019ve been screaming financial abuse all over this board", "YTA. \nHe had a right to know how much she makes, but she didn't have a right to know about his \"teeny\" gambling problem? Fuck off outta here. Newsflash: if this is the third time he's needed bailing out, HE'S NOT HANDLING IT.", "You're a major asshole. You stirred the pot in something that's none of your business. Shame on you.", "So it\u2019s okay for Tim to know why Claire can pay the bills but it\u2019s not okay for Claire to know why Tim can\u2019t?  \n\nYTA - Claire should ditch you and Tim. Tim should get help for his addiction.", "YTA and I hope Claire kicks the mooch out! Usually people who play the victim and need everyone to bail them out won\u2019t get better, they get worse. If you were a real friend you\u2019d encourage Claire to find a partner that won\u2019t drain her dry.", "YTA he had no right to know something your friend told you in confidence. The way you downplay his inability to pay his bills due to a gambling problem you kept as a secret from your friend, while in turn revealing how much she makes to someone she was gracious enough to give a home to is absolutely insane, and honestly the way you talk about her and how much she earns makes you sound incredibly jealous.", "Yta\u2026. Their only dating a couple months and you feel because she\u2019s successful she now is obligated to share her financial information with him and support him so he can be an entitled mooch. I would drop you as a friend to put her in a bad position. Her money is not everyone\u2019s money. Dating 4 mos and she has to share her money..your a jerk", "YTA. \u201cA teeny gambling problem\u201d! He can\u2019t support himself, and you turn that into the girlfriend\u2019s problem.", "YTA\n...How can this even be real?\nYou never discuss income or get involved in someone's relationships.\n\nAlso, people that HAVE money are not the personal bank for everyone else they know. \n\nBe a better friend. I hope you learn from this.", "YTA - it wasn\u2019t your business to tell and it\u2019s not Claire\u2019s responsibility to pay for someone who puts gambling over his bills.  \n\nThere\u2019s a saying that comes to mind here, nobody falls in love quicker than a dude who needs a place to stay.", "I don't think so.  You were helping your friend.  Maybe you could have handled it better, but you had good intentions.  They both were keeping major secrets and that is their own problems.  Lying about wealth and hiding an addiction are both issues that could break up a relationship and neither were your fault.  They would still be together if they were honest to each other.  NTA.", "Yes, of course YTA. \n1 - you interfered in their relationship.\n2 - you gave information that wasn't yours to give.\n3 - you were vile about your friend regarding her finances and personal decisions. You come across as jealous. \n4 - gambling problems are not \"teeny\". He withheld this information from her and you backed him up. Knowing someone was into gambling would be a deal breaker for many people. \n\nShe is right to tell you off. You're a bad friend.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nClearly jealous about your \"friend's\" fortune (and probably that she was in the honeymoon stage with a new partner. You took the opportunity to make sure everything went to shit there and you know it!)\n\nWhat right do you have to meddle in anyone's business?", "There's no way this is real.  \n\nYTA majorly - stay in your lane. And stop trying to get Claire to fuel Tim's addiction.", "YTA. If his gambling issue was under control he would not need help. YTA for getting into their business but holding back on claire.", "YTA. you had no business telling him anything about her financial affairs. You should have simply changed the subject and not gotten into it. Claire owes him nothing. I hate how anyone who has money is expected to share it, cover expenses for others, and so on.", "YTA - it\u2019s completely irrelevant how much she makes and it\u2019s not your place to inform your friend ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s because you think she should support him when he\u2019s irresponsible and essentially free loading off her. It\u2019s perfect that he\u2019s now freeloading off YOU.", "YTA. They moved in quickly because the landlord was selling and instead of getting a new place, he moved in with his girlfriend of a few months. After reading your post, I doubt he had the money to get a new place. They have only been dating a few months, yet this is already the 3rd time he hasn\u2019t been able to pay his bills? This is more than a tiny gambling problem. Just because she earns more doesn\u2019t mean she needs to support him, it\u2019s only been a few months and they aren\u2019t married.", "They've been together for a few months and you think she should be financing his life? YTA", "YTA\n\nYour friend doesn't have a small gambling problem\n\nHe is an addict\n\nAnd you are not helping him by trying to get someone to pay his bills for him.  That will only encourage him to gamble more since he has a safety net", "YTA, \n\nFirst of this is truly none of your business. How they split finances is between them \n\n2nd: just because Claire makes more money does not mean Tim has a right to mooch. \n\n3rd: she trusted you with someone personal\u2026 and you broke that trust.", "YTA\n\nYou interfered where it wasn't needed, and now you get to experience Tim's 'teeny gambling problem' for yourself.

Thats why he's on your couch right now. Clair had already correctly assessed that sharing that info would lead him to feel entitled to things he's not entitled to. And here you are", "YTA If she gives him all her money, he gambles it away and she can take care of him the rest of her life as if she's his mom. I used to give money, but they only take advantage of you. I also thought about a friend of mine, when we were in our 20s: why doesnt she help her poor boyfriend? Because she's smart. Took me ages to become that smart.", "YTA.  You keep Tim's gambling secret but spill Claire's financial secrets?  Why should Claire pay all the bills just because she can afford to?  It's not her responsibility to keep Tim afloat when he's gambling his money away.  Sounds to me like you have a crush on Tim, I can't imagine why else you're taking his side so strongly when he's clearly in the wrong.  You're a bad friend and an interfering busybody.", "He should just leave her, it's so different when it's a man who does this. Then it's abusive. Edit, ya all arseholes", "YTA.  She most likely shared her financial information with you because she was proud her business took off and because she trusted you.  You threw that trust right out the window the second you told him.  Regardless of how much she makes, they are/were living together and he should be paying a share.  Running/growing a business is hard and a lot of work.  Regardless of what she makes, she is earning it.  She doesn't need to be giving this guy a free ride unless she would choose to.  How dare you, seriously...", "Yta Oh wow, so her not telling him about her finances til she feels he is in for the right reasons is bad, but hiding a gambling addiction is OK. Wow, op, you really need some reality check", "YTA - why you felt like her finances were your business is beyond me. They are not married, engaged, or in a long term relationship. He does not need to know her finances. \n\nShe supported your dead way  friend for three months.

It is ENTIRELY between THEM what their bills and finances, and especially IF HE HAS A FREAKING GAMBLING ADDICTION that he's been hiding.\n\nYou and Tim clearly have a thing going on, and you were looking to break them up.", "YTA.  You told her boyfriend, who has a gambling problem (that she doesn't know about), that his girlfriend is rich.  You are the most enabliest enabler there ever was.  What happens if the boyfriend starts stealing from her to fund his gambling problem?  Because that's what people with gambling addictions do when they are out of money of their own.  She is absolutely doing the right thing by telling him she won't continue to cover 100% of the costs.  She is right to question why he has no money, especially when she paid all the bills the last couple of months.  If his gambling was under control, he would have money to contribute towards the bills.  You are doing both Tim and Claire no favors, and you might have just opened the biggest can of worms you'll ever see.  Since you're telling secrets, you might as well tell Claire now that he has a gambling problem so she can take steps to protect her money and assets, now that you told an addicted gambler that she's loaded.", "So, he had the right to know the good news that the girlfriend had lots of money, but she didn't have the right to know the bad news that he had an addiction? That's how only a bad, crappy friend can think. Be very grateful if she keeps speaking to you after this, cause it feels so close to betrayal.\nYTA, big time", "Yes. Excellent. 100% the best answer.", "Indeed! Imagine having a 'friend' who is aware that your relatively new boyfriend has a gambling problem, but who doesn't think to warn you about that. But who then butts in about YOUR finances and broadcasts them to the boyfriend. With friends like these, really you do NOT need enemies anymore.", "Love this comment. We don't even need to get into the other issues. I'd love OP's answer to this.", "Yeah, it is kindof perfect that Tim is using OP the same way he used Claire and, by OP\u2019s logic, OP is morally obligated to pay all Tim\u2019s bills/gambling debts.", "Yeah and it doesn\u2019t sound like a small gambling problem if he doesn\u2019t have money to contribute to the household bills that OP says aren\u2019t very much to begin with.", "I love that she described it as a \u2018teeny gambling problem\u2019.  Hmm\u2026is it really considered \u2018teeny\u2019 if it is causing him to be unable to pay his bills for several months?", "But it's only a teeny gambling problem. /s", "\"a teeny gambling problem\"  There are no teeny gambling problems.", "It won\u2019t be a teeny problem once he decides he has unlimited funds and someone to bail him out.", "Thank you for the award, kind stranger <3", "And Claire found out that her \"friend\" is really not a friend at all, but a jealous backstabbing person, who should not be trusted. \n\nOP, yes YTA\n\nEdit: grammar", "More like *she's* better off without *him*... dudes got a gambling problem and can't be bothered to pay his bills.", "In what way is he better off without her? He's a homeless gambling addict", "How is the homeless gambler better off? Lol", "She paid 100% for their shared expenses. How much more you want her contribute?", "Claire has paid 100% of the bills for 3 months & probably knows somethings wrong with him not having money. I'd be kicking him out, too.", "Why what has clair done wrong?", "The only two people who suck are the bf and the OP. Claire is an innocent bystander who was shit on by her \"friend\".", "Honestly, I just love that OP and their husband are going to be the ones housing their freeloading friend now. Karma working at it's best", "I can almost guarantee Claire is pushing back after 3 months of paying all the bills because she figured out she's being used by this AH. How OP think Claire is the problem is baffling.", "How did she lie?", "YTA.\n\nWhy did you feel that it was important for him to know about her finances yet his gambling problem was somehow not Claire's business?", "Why does Claire suck? She's been supporting a freeloader with a gambling problem for months. Notice OP didn't tell Claire about Tim's gambling?", "She paid 2 months full expenses for a guy she's been seeing for a few months. And said friend has a gambling problem and didn't tell her that while he happily took her money. His bff is calling her a bitch for not having a limit of not paying the dude's bills forever. And she sucks?\n\nClaire, hope you're away from these guys soon \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "This.\n\nIt sounds like Tim is financially irresponsible, and Claire didn\u2019t want to support him early in their relationship. His *teensy* gambling problem is probably worse than he\u2019s letting on, if for the THIRD month in a row he\u2019s not able to pay any bills.\n\nThey\u2019re not married or engaged, they\u2019re *dating*. There is no permanent promise to care for one another.\n\nIdk why Reddit seems to think that people who are dating should be sharing finances/expenses proportionally instead of equally, when there\u2019s no guarantee that savings (for a home/retirement) are going to be shared. In marriage, there are legal financial protections for splitting assets.\n\nClaire made the right call - this guy is now your problem and will be a drain on your finances.", "I\u2019m betting she\u2019s not Claire\u2019s friend anymore", "Possible reasons-\n\nOP is jealous of Claire\u2019s success and wanted to punish her for it\n\nOP feels Claire has not been generous enough with her and thought if Tim knew, he could get access to Claire\u2019s money and would share the wealth with OP and her husband \n\nOP truly believes in the patriarchal view that all finances should be handled by the man, so even if the woman is the primary breadwinner, she should hand her paycheck over to him and let him deal with everything and not presume to know any of the details because \u201cit\u2019s a man\u2019s job\u201d\n\nOr sone combination of the above", "I bet no one would say this if the genders were reversed. She didn't have to tell him anything: it is her money, her apartment and they aren't married not even that long together nor had an agreement that she would financially support him.", "Lying about wealth because the person who moved into your house with a sob story and hasn't paid any living expenses for three months is NOT a bad thing.\n\nA fool and their money are quickly seperated.\n\nAnd Claire was supposed to keep paying his bills according to OP?", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Well she didn't lie about her wealth, she just isn't obligated to share it. Of the two, especially only months into the relationship, information about how much someone makes doesn't have to be shared right away and should be discussed later when talking about sharing a financial future. \n\nHiding a gambling addiction however is not in the same sphere, it is terrible and should be shared immediately so that the other person can make the decision to put in the time and patience to help someone recover or get out of there.", "It was zero percent OP\u2019s business.", "You forgot the /s at the end of your sentences", "They\u2019ve been dating for a few months. OP\u2019s friend doesn\u2019t owe her bf of a few months her compensation details, nor does she owe him free housing.", "Yeah I don't get it. Op says he has a \"small gambling problem\" but is working on it and apparently is also a freeloader. He defintiely didn't need to know how much money Claire makes. Claire needs to get rid of this gambling mooch immediately.", "Sounds like Tim is a hobosexual/coach surfer. It\u2019s karma that he is now OP\u2019s problem and not Claire\u2019s", "YTA.  Pretty sure Claire doesn\u2019t consider them a friend anymore!", "Exactly. It'll be a neverending cycle if he has an enabler.", "This!!! I love when people go off in the comments", "Agreed.  I think it goes both ways.", "It doesn't fix his problems but if she's not honest with him, it's not a good relationship.  Gambling is an addiction that needs help. Lying is a choice.  An honest, \"no, I'm not going to help you financially\" would have been better.", "I see I have misread. I rescind my thoughts on Claire, thank you", "Seriously. She gave him THREE MONTHS in her house he moved in of due to being evicted (I'd bet there's more to that story) and SHE'S THE BAD GUY? They've been together for months and he's already been using her for months and OP thinks her friend should do so indefinitely while being lied to because...\n\nI honestly can't tell you.", "Maybe the downplaying her success part? Idk what that means exactly but it might imply she lied about how much business she has.", "I'm betting she was never really her friend at all.", "These honestly make sense and atleast one of these inspired Ops way of thinking !!", "Yeah and apparently it's cool for OP to tell the guy about the girl's financial situation but not cool to tell the girl about the guy's finances..when that involves an addiction! THAT'S what would be okay to share if anything. I dated a guy with a gambling problem. His mom had one too. His parents lost their house over her issue the same week that my BF came home and told he didn't take the night drop to the bank for the company he worked for..he went to the boat and lost it all.", "Cause the lying about the gambling addition isn\u2019t a choice?  An honest \u201cI can\u2019t pay my part of the bills because I\u2019m an addict\u201d would have been better\u2026", "The more you think about it, the more it sounds like the beginning of a murder mystery.\n\nThe motives make no sense in any of this except the idea of removing Claire from her financial success.", "Absolutely.  It's unclear if gambling is the reason for not being able to pay bills.  \"He's handling it.\"", "100% agree! I've been binging CSI Las Vegas and obviously so many of the episodes are about money and murder.", "Let's ass a little sex appeal for zest.\n\nPlot twist; OP and Tim are secretly lovers mooching off different people who plan to ultimately run off with their blood money together.\n\nOk, now I'm just being silly."]}
