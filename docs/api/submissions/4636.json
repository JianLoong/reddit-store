That being said you shouldn\u2019t talk to your brother about it. He\u2019s ten years old and he\u2019s going to believe his mom. Maybe when he\u2019s older you can try to tell him everything and he\u2019ll understand it more. I also don\u2019t think the bro is TA. Your ex stepmom is definitely the AH. Why isn\u2019t your dad trying to tell his son why he and his mom broke up?", "This is a family therapy issue, not a Reddit issue.\n\nYour ex step-mom is an AH. You and your brother are kids navigating your feelings as best you can and you're both hurting, so you're treating each other in emotionally unsophisticated ways. Come from a place of kindness talking to your brother. He's 10; he has no power to control the sucky things in his life. He loves his mom, and you're not going to be the person that can \"open his eyes\" to her reality. These are huge feelings. What she's done and is doing isn't right, but - again - bw you and your brother, you can't talk to him about her. Be kind, let him know you're sorry you hurt his feelings and how much you really do want him to have a good birthday, then give him space to decide what he wants to do, and respect his choice. \n\nYour feelings are understandable and valid - I'd be sick of being blamed for someone else's behavior too. But the only thing you can control is how you treat your brother, and if you are consistently kind, in time, he'll come to see how people really are.", "NTA. \n\nIt's understandable that you're fed up and that your former step-mom's actions are causing a rift between you and your brother. \n\nI do think that there was probably a more age appropriate way of explaining what the issue is, and that was the responsibility of your dad to share, not yours.", "NTA. You don't have to stand aside and let yourself be blamed by anyone, no matter their age. He's old enough to know that he is saying hurtful things.", "NTA but you're 18 and he's 10 so you could've handled it more maturely but ultimately your dad is failing both of you for not doing his job and teaching your brother the truth and about honesty.", "It's revolting when adults blame kids for their own failings, and even worse when they warp kids' minds into thinking that sort of shit is the truth. And your dad... where's he? He should be defending you, and that he's apparently not is pretty bad too.  \n\n\nI think perhaps you could've handled things better with your brother, and maybe it could've waited until after his birthday. Where he is on the subject isn't really his fault; he's just parroting what his mother told him.  \n\n\nSo ESH, just because of bad handling and timing. But you're not wrong to defend yourself against the accusations of your step mother.", "NTA, because I understand why you felt fed up. Yes, you could have handled it better, as your brother is still a young child, but it's your father's responsibility to talk to him about the reasons behind the divorce. He's the parent, not you.\n\nI hope your dad talked to him because if he doesn't stand up for you, he's complicit and shares the blame for the rift that was wrongly placed between you and your brother. It's not fair on either of you kids.", "E S H\n\nHe is 10. I understand your feelings too, though. Sounds like you 3 men need to sit down and have a bro moment.", "I think that your brother is young but his stepmom is really bad u just need to wait. She is wrong because she has a little kid and she y'ells at him and she tries to prove that some particular people are bad NTA", "NTA! You're allowed to be tired of an adult who attempted to make a child feel bad about their very existence while simultaneously creating a wedge between you and your brother. She's the kind of insecure woman who thinks a man should never look back at his previous relationships and only care about his present life. Ex stepmother is definitely the wicked one. Yes, your brother is too young to understand those kinds of dynamics, but he should be aware of how manipulative and evil his mother truly is. The seed is planted, the truth will come out, it's inevitable.", "YTA. Kid is 10. Your behavior is only reinforcing the idea that your an AH. If you were kind and got him a gift he will come around and realize your not what the step-mom says you are.", "OOOOF\u2026.YTA. And you know why. That  DEFINITELY ISN\u2019T the time or place to make that argument with a 10 year old kid.  \u2026. He did need to be told the truth, and that he hurt you by blaming you and that you love him like a brother\u2026. You DO. Live him don\u2019t you? So apologize for making him upset on his birthday. Then explain how hurt you are.", "YTA\n\nHis mother should definitely be kinder, more diplomatic and self-aware, but he\u2019s 10. He has plenty of time to learn that the sun doesn\u2019t shine out of Mommy\u2019s butt. For now, he needs to be able to rely on his parents, as long as they\u2019re not actively abusive.\n\nNext time, give him a gift and say something like this:\n\n\u201cBud, I want you to know that I love you like crazy. \n\nWhen you get a little bit older you\u2019ll realize that there are two sides to every story. But for now, just remember that you shouldn\u2019t let anybody put hate toward another person into your heart. Watch peoples\u2019 actions, listen to their words, and decide for yourself. It\u2019s true that your Mom and I have our issues and I\u2019ll answer any questions that you have honestly, but believe me when I say I\u2019m just as caught in the middle of this as you are.\n\nI\u2019m going to keep on loving you no matter how you feel about me, and I\u2019ll try to always be there for you. I know you miss the time when everybody was together. But some things just aren\u2019t meant to be.

Your dad also might consider talking to a therapist about how to explain the cause of the divorce in an age appropriate way.", "NTA he had to learn the truth.", "NYA but poor timing and tact!", "Your dad's integrity feels misplaced here. He should be honest with kid about why thijgs happenened rather that be respectful towards someone who is lying and destructive. He can tell the truth and answer questions with \"that's what your mother believes\". The kid will figure it out.\n\nAs things stand his passivity is putting you in a terrible situation.\n\nNTA for acting in self defence", ">That being said you shouldn\u2019t talk to your brother about it. He\u2019s ten years old and he\u2019s going to believe his mom. Maybe when he\u2019s older you can try to tell him everything\n\nThe OP is only eighteen himself and it sounds like he's been dealing with this nonsense before he was even a teenager. He has every right to defend himself to his brother when attacked. This kid needs to keep hearing what an AH his mother is.", "Your dad needs to get him into therapy ASAP- right now she\u2019s badmouthing you but I can guarantee she\u2019ll start to try to alienate your father too- like if he ever gets in a new relationship or won\u2019t pay for her new bf\u2019s kids shoes when he bought your brother shoes.", "My mom did the same with my dad. It's normally the right thing to do. However here is the point that makes your situation different. She is disparaging you. Your father is still your father and his duty to you should out weigh being nice to your step mom.", "I understand that but it sounds like your little brother is struggling with his feelings about the divorce, I hope your dad gets him in therapy where he can have a safe place to talk about them", "This is a messed up way for your father to be treating her and by extension you.\n\nHe's not disparaging her by *holding her accountable* for the awful thing she did by throwing you under the bus and before anyone, you need to talk to him about the fact he would rather throw up unnecessary defenses for his ex at the expense of the relationship between his children.\n\nYour relationship with your brother shouldn't have to suffer because he's advocating for a backwards moral.", "He can defend himself sure but he should have more emotional control. Him snapping back will just prove the step mom\u2019s lies.", "Literally the opposite", "Dad can't control what ex says about anyone else. There's nothing he can do about what she chooses to tell the kid when kid is with her. Welcome to the hell that is bad co-parenting.\n\nDad is setting an example that he won't stoop to her level, and the result of that lesson is on full display where OP knows something worse is happening out of his control but is questioning how he handled it and if he should be better in the future. OP is more mature than his ex step-mom and it's because Dad is at least decent enough to teach this lesson.", "Dude your words hit so hard. I still feel like I\u2019m never enough and my narc mother has been dead for 6 years.", "not terribly long before my mother died in 2021, it became really apparent to me (the eldest) that my parents should have never had kids. \n\nI raised the two younger kids, because no one else was doing it. \n\nI wish someone had told me when I was 10, or 20, or 30, or 40, or even 50 that it wasn't anything I did wrong, she just never wanted kids, and didn't want to parent.", "I hugely disagree with myeyedeal. My dad is a covert narcissist, I spent years thinking something was wrong with me because he didn\u2019t spend time with me, ever. And he lived in the same house with me and my mom, his wife. She divorced him when I was an adult, and it was such a relief when she admitted the truth about him. I guess she thought if she didn\u2019t mention it she hoped I wouldn\u2019t realize the way he acted. Instead I blamed myself for decades!!!", "Yeah have fun being a \"turn the other cheek as it doesn't affect me, only others\" person.  Good luck", "I hope you're able to find some peace. It's an ongoing struggle.", "Respectfully he may have left his ex but she's still poisoning her own son, using him as a pawn to make OP's life harder and making it even harder for the two brothers to have a strong bond.

See if you can get a therapist to help frame it so he's not bashing the kids mom.", "NTA", "NTA. Don't be hard on yourself. Your little brother is unhappy because of his mom's actions, not yours. Your dad is wrong, too. There are age-appropriate ways to clarify this situation. Now that it's festered and boiled over your dad really needs to step up.", "NAH - He\u2019s ten.

Better he knows now the letting this lie drag on and erupting later.", "Generally I would agree with your dad, but currently he is allowing his ex to disparage you instead. Which is even more unethical. He may not like it, but if he doesn't set things right, and allows you to continue to me his meat shield, then he is a coward and an AH, along with his ex.", "Have to agree, because it isn't enough to tell a 10 year old \"no that isn't how it is\" and just leave the alternative blank.  In this case we have \"no OP didn't cause us to break up\" with no alternative for cause because dad refuses to give even a sanitized reason it sounds like.  Most children still have a basic scientific mind, if you're going to refute a hypothesis you must give a reasonable alternative.", "I mean you're arguing semantics, c'mon.

Nothing in your post comes off as very loving toward your dad or brother or suggests you did anything to ingratiate yourself to stepmom. Is it a two-way street? Yes. But without her side of the story we don't really know how she acted cold around you or if she was just trying to parent. What we can tell is the brother's reaction, which suggests that clearly one side came off nicer than the other.", "NTA. Your ex-stepmom was and your dad sort of is.

It should never have gone this long.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother will realize sooner or later what a witch his mom is.", "NTA but don't try again, not because it would make you the AH but because it's pointless. There's nothing you can do. When he gets bigger, be sure never to let him hurt you or your stuff. You don't have to be silent, you can say the truth all you want, but never expect him to believe you.\n\nI'm sorry your dad doesn't understand that stating facts is not parental alienation and that stating exactly what happened and what his ex did in detail with no judgment is not disparagement.", "NTA, and it sounds like alienation, which is abuse to you, your Dad, and your brother.  He should consult a lawyer and see if he can get counseling for your brother.", "NTA.  That title is reserved for your psycho ex-stepmother and, unfortunately, for your dad.  He needs to fix this right now.  Try sitting down with him and explaining that his allowing the ten year old to continue to believe that you broke up the marriage is making both your life and the ten year old's life very painful.  He needs to find a way to tell the boy that you had nothing to do with the break-up of the marriage, that it was 100 per cent his decision,  that marriages break up because of the grown-ups, never ever because of the children, etc. etc. etc. without directly disparaging his ex.  He needs to say this every time your little brother says anything on the subject that's negative toward you.  He needs to stop the 10 year old from being mean to you.  Every.  Single.  Time.", "Although I went through the same thing, I have a 40 year old cousin that never questioned his mother's manipulation", "Your dad is right to not denigrate your little brother's mom to him right now.  He will eventually come to see you're not a bad person and aren't the person his mom says you are.  Once he's older and starts to see how his mom is he'll realize she so very biased and wrong.  For now just tell him you love him and want the best for him.  It's hard for you right now to always hear that you stink and you suck.  But in the long run being loving and supportive will win the day.  Hang in there for your lil bro.  You may be all he has someday.", ">My dad thinks it's unethical to disparage former partners\n\nBut it's okay to disparage children/siblings?   Because your former step mom is definitely doing that and your dad shares the guilt for letting it happen.  He's not only allowing you (his child, who he should be protecting) to be unfairly villainized , but really isn't doing your brother any favors either.\n\nTalk with your dad.  Ask that he get your brother in therapy, share the truth with the therapist, and have the professional help him share the truth with your brother.", "I am kind of torn because it's his birthday and he wants both his parents together, and you weren't the kindest.

My reasoning was that I didn't want my son to think \"I'm half my father\" and think badly about himself (because maybe he was like his father. He absolutely was not, nor is he anything like his dad). I did not want my opinion of his father to affect his relationship with him. Even though he would have been better off if he didn't have to see him. I had full custody, but his father took me to court for scheduled visitation (I never had prevented him from seeing his son though, in spite of how I felt about him), [one week] before I was supposed to move out of state, or he would not give me permission to leave the state. Believe me, there were many times I wanted to tell him how much his father sucked, but I never did, I felt that was something he needed to decide for himself. There were many times his father broke his heart when he was younger, but their final \"blow out\" happened when my son was 18, and I think that finally sealed the deal, as far as my son's opinion of him goes. My son is now 29 and had a son of his own, and he has told me that he will never be like his dad. He does still see his father sometimes still (he lives 1300+ miles away), only because his father wants to see his grandson, but my son complains about having to see him because he can see now, everything that I hated about his father. I only recently told him earlier this year, that everything he dislikes about his dad are exactly the same things that I had issues with, he's a mooch, always the \"victim\", only thinks about himself, and my son remembers EVERY TIME his father broke his heart. It was very hard to not say anything when my son was younger, but now I feel like I can FINALLY tell him exactly why I disliked his father so much, but I still only said anything after my son had first.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge though, his father has also never said anything bad about me. Except the time that my son wanted to go to a birthday party for my LONG time friend's daughter's birthday party, instead of going to his father's that day (he was going to go over later after the party. My son was 15, and the birthday girl was turning 4. My son adored her, and she's him, and he really wanted to bed there for her birthday. His dad FLIPPED out and demanded that he not too to the party. It got pretty bad, and he was attacking my son on Facebook, and myself because I told my son that he could definitely go, as he was old enough to make his own decision about visiting his father.\n\nI'm glad that he did finally see the kind of person really is, it was very hard for me when he had his dad on a pedestal when he was younger, and I had to comfort him everytime his father blew him off. And he is an excellent father to my grandson, the exact opposite of his own father.", "He\u2019s not that good. He\u2019s perfectly fine letting the stepmom alienate his son from the rest of his family and letting you take the blame for it. You\u2019re what, 18 now? Still very young yourself. Your parents have really failed to be adults about this. I mean think about it\u2014he doesn\u2019t want his ex to \u201clook bad\u201d so he lets you look bad instead? Who the fuck does that? Someone who doesn\u2019t want to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d in other people\u2019s eyes even if it\u2019s his own kid who takes the bullet for him. Never mind your stepmother, who sounds straight out of \u201cCinderella\u201d.", "Your dad should speak up when it affects You. His 10 yr old son thinks that his older kid is the reason they seperated and hates older kid. That should be a reason for dad to try to stop being an angel and tell the truth."]}
