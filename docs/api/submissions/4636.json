That being said you shouldn\u2019t talk to your brother about it. He\u2019s ten years old and he\u2019s going to believe his mom. Maybe when he\u2019s older you can try to tell him everything and he\u2019ll understand it more. I also don\u2019t think the bro is TA. Your ex stepmom is definitely the AH. Why isn\u2019t your dad trying to tell his son why he and his mom broke up?", "This is a family therapy issue, not a Reddit issue.\n\nYour ex step-mom is an AH. You and your brother are kids navigating your feelings as best you can and you're both hurting, so you're treating each other in emotionally unsophisticated ways. Come from a place of kindness talking to your brother. He's 10; he has no power to control the sucky things in his life. He loves his mom, and you're not going to be the person that can \"open his eyes\" to her reality. These are huge feelings. What she's done and is doing isn't right, but - again - bw you and your brother, you can't talk to him about her. Be kind, let him know you're sorry you hurt his feelings and how much you really do want him to have a good birthday, then give him space to decide what he wants to do, and respect his choice. \n\nYour feelings are understandable and valid - I'd be sick of being blamed for someone else's behavior too. But the only thing you can control is how you treat your brother, and if you are consistently kind, in time, he'll come to see how people really are.", "NTA. \n\nIt's understandable that you're fed up and that your former step-mom's actions are causing a rift between you and your brother. \n\nI do think that there was probably a more age appropriate way of explaining what the issue is, and that was the responsibility of your dad to share, not yours.", "NTA. You don't have to stand aside and let yourself be blamed by anyone, no matter their age. He's old enough to know that he is saying hurtful things.", "NTA but you're 18 and he's 10 so you could've handled it more maturely but ultimately your dad is failing both of you for not doing his job and teaching your brother the truth and about honesty.", "It's revolting when adults blame kids for their own failings, and even worse when they warp kids' minds into thinking that sort of shit is the truth. And your dad... where's he? He should be defending you, and that he's apparently not is pretty bad too.  \n\n\nI think perhaps you could've handled things better with your brother, and maybe it could've waited until after his birthday. Where he is on the subject isn't really his fault; he's just parroting what his mother told him.  \n\n\nSo ESH, just because of bad handling and timing. But you're not wrong to defend yourself against the accusations of your step mother.", "NTA, because I understand why you felt fed up. Yes, you could have handled it better, as your brother is still a young child, but it's your father's responsibility to talk to him about the reasons behind the divorce. He's the parent, not you.\n\nI hope your dad talked to him because if he doesn't stand up for you, he's complicit and shares the blame for the rift that was wrongly placed between you and your brother. It's not fair on either of you kids.", "E S H\n\nHe is 10. I understand your feelings too, though. Sounds like you 3 men need to sit down and have a bro moment.", "I think that your brother is young but his stepmom is really bad u just need to wait. She is wrong because she has a little kid and she y'ells at him and she tries to prove that some particular people are bad NTA", "NTA! You're allowed to be tired of an adult who attempted to make a child feel bad about their very existence while simultaneously creating a wedge between you and your brother. She's the kind of insecure woman who thinks a man should never look back at his previous relationships and only care about his present life. Ex stepmother is definitely the wicked one. Yes, your brother is too young to understand those kinds of dynamics, but he should be aware of how manipulative and evil his mother truly is. The seed is planted, the truth will come out, it's inevitable.", "YTA. Kid is 10. Your behavior is only reinforcing the idea that your an AH. If you were kind and got him a gift he will come around and realize your not what the step-mom says you are.", "OOOOF\u2026.YTA. And you know why. That  DEFINITELY ISN\u2019T the time or place to make that argument with a 10 year old kid.  \u2026. He did need to be told the truth, and that he hurt you by blaming you and that you love him like a brother\u2026. You DO. Live him don\u2019t you? So apologize for making him upset on his birthday. Then explain how hurt you are.", "YTA\n\nHis mother should definitely be kinder, more diplomatic and self-aware, but he\u2019s 10. He has plenty of time to learn that the sun doesn\u2019t shine out of Mommy\u2019s butt. For now, he needs to be able to rely on his parents, as long as they\u2019re not actively abusive.\n\nNext time, give him a gift and say something like this:\n\n\u201cBud, I want you to know that I love you like crazy. \n\nWhen you get a little bit older you\u2019ll realize that there are two sides to every story. But for now, just remember that you shouldn\u2019t let anybody put hate toward another person into your heart. Watch peoples\u2019 actions, listen to their words, and decide for yourself. It\u2019s true that your Mom and I have our issues and I\u2019ll answer any questions that you have honestly, but believe me when I say I\u2019m just as caught in the middle of this as you are.\n\nI\u2019m going to keep on loving you no matter how you feel about me, and I\u2019ll try to always be there for you. I know you miss the time when everybody was together. But some things just aren\u2019t meant to be.
