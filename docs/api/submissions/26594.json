Naturally he's quite upset and is feeling rather defensive, but he is very sorry. That is not an easy thing for him to say yet he said it very clearly multiple times. He is going to try to catch a flight home tomorrow. He going to take a week or two off work to help me get some things set up in place for me. Help around the house and some baby sitting. \n\nHe encouraged me to take time off work as well and to just stop thinking about finances for right now. He said he'll deal with it for awhile. He says whenever I go back to work it won't be like it was. He will help me. He'll make sure I have some extra money and extra time.\n\nI could cry with relief. I am crying with relief\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\n**UPDATE:** I sent this to my husband. A lot of people are saying he abuses me. I know in my heart this is NOT his intention. He is NOT a bad man. I want him to read through everything and really think about it and how much I'm struggling and how desperately I need his help. So many of you agree with me that I can't do it all and I'm very thankful I'm not alone in those thoughts.\n\n\\----------\n\nA year ago my husband got a really great job. He loves it. It over doubled our income. The problem is he's never here. It requires a lot of travel and he's gone more of the month than he's home.\n\nWe have three kids. 8, 6, 3. We have two dogs. I am run ragged. I don't have any family to help me. I don't have time for friends. It's never ending. Cleaning, kids, cooking, kids, dogs, dogs,  school, kids, cleaning cleaning kids CLEANING COOKING CLEANING. No time for me whatsoever.\n\nBefore my husband got this job we worked opposite schedules. I worked in a restaurant/bar in the evenings. Didnt pay great but a couple really good friends worked there with me. It was how I socialized. Now that he's gone, I couldn't work that job since nobody watches kids at night. Now I work a part time retail job I hate with what are essentially children (in comparison to me). I don't get to socialize like I used to. I only work the hours my kids are in school. But we have after school activities, homework, dogs, dinner, never ending chores, etc. THERE IS NO TIME FOR ME. I don't even get to sleep alone since my 6 year old has night terrors.\n\nWhen my husband was here, things felt more divided. I still did a lot during the day, but it wasn't never ending. There would still be days I didn't have to worry about lunches or bath time or homework because my husband would pick up the slack. I could go out with friends from time to time.\n\nDon't even get me started on what it's like when the kids get sick and then I inevitably get sick. It's absolute misery and he's not around to see it. I'm left drowning.\n\nBut he doesn't want to quit. He loves his job and that's fair. I can see he's way happier now, but what about me? Don't I matter? I don't know how I'm supposed to get through this. I demanded for the sake of my sanity he quit his job, but he exploded. He thinks we're doing better than ever. We could get a bigger house soon (we live in 2 bedroom rancher but I like it). That the kids will have so many more opportunities, etc, and he's not wrong, but what about me?!?!?!

Time appears to be the more precious one to you, on which I happen to agree since time cannot be replaced. However, you can use money to pay for things that take away time from you. You can pay people to clean your home, do laundry, and even cook for you.

She\u2019s raising three kids who aren\u2019t hers or his because *he* wanted to take in his sisters kids. She pays for preschool and groceries and any other household fees. She doesn\u2019t have a washer/dryer and pays to do the laundry at a laundromat. She sleeps on a pull out couch so the kids can have rooms. She skips lunch to afford to feed the kids. She works to support the kids the full time their schedule is occupied. She pays for her own gas/car insurance and receives absolutely no spending money from him in any capacity. OP loves these kids deeply and it would be hard to leave because she may have limited options to stay in their lives. **OPs inheritance due to a family death is also they only reason the could afford their current house to begin with, which just makes the financial divide so much stranger. \n\nWhen her husband is home a week a month, he doesn\u2019t help.

I know that\u2019s a hard pill to swallow. That means both of you need to be able to work as a team. At least at this point, your husband is doing all four of you a disgusting disservice. He gets to flit away and enjoy the ego boost of doing a \u201cgood thing\u201d with none of the sacrifice. You\u2019re living in abject poverty while his life, room/board, and meals are all covered. He returns with enough spare money for downtime, the gym, and I\u2019m assuming meals out with friends. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s being honest about the money.

Because honestly it sound like they're living like shit IMO one of the things I think OP is a bit of an AH for is going \"but I like the house\". 2 adults, 3 children, and 2 dogs in a 2 bedroom house missing major conveniences. It is literally no surprise that her husband loves a job where he's away so much.\n\nOP definitely needs to have a conversation about merging finances, or at the very least him putting a good portion into a shared account for household/childrens expenses. She needs to make it clear that this situation can't continue if/when they move to a new house. But this is where learning the actual financial situation is key, because if it is true that he's squirrelling for a house, then there will be extra cash. or the giant AH option. Not sure what to do if he is genuinely doing something dodgy, but if he's genuinely seeing the situation as short term pain for long term gain then he needs to be told to step up whilst that pain is on", "YTA, absolutely....all I hear in this post is ME, ME, ME. First of all, bad planning on your part to have so many kids in the first place. Second, you're completely missing the obvious. If you guys are doing so well financially, and you're so overstressed, hire a nanny, and start teaching your oldest kid how to do some of the cleaning and household chores.\n\nI retract what I said after hearing that the kids are your husband's sister's...your husband is the jerk. He never should have taken those kids to live with the two of you in the first place if he wasn't planning on helping out way more than he does.

He needs to clean something, make a couple dinners, run the kids around and give you some form of a break. \nMy wife and I currently have a similar situation but I am the sole bread winner at the moment being the difference which does indeed afford me some slack. My primary advantage in this is I\u2019m allowed to get a more stable sleep schedule as she is a SAHM and I have to go work 6-7 days a week to make our ends meet. But when I am at home I still deal with what what must be done and give her the rest and breaks I can. I do much less of the cleaning than her and that is primarily cause she is home all day and keeps it up but when it\u2019s needed I do it and I still do all the yard work, all the cooking, take care all of our financial aspects, I do all the shopping ,and I do my fair share of child rearing and pet maintenance.

You can award them with a golden star stick when they do their chores and when they've done enough you can reward them with pizza/hamburger/taco night (that'll save you time cooking).

And then what about health insurance and all that crap? Are you willing to take on 50% of the financial load in the event he comes back in to take back his share of the household duties? Also on the flip side is the money he makes good enough for you to have nanny or even a maid? If not, then maybe the job is a bit overrated in the provider department.

I know you may think you aren\u2019t being hit and those resources aren\u2019t for you, but they are. They\u2019re for woman who have been forced into inescapable situations to begin new.", "Why would he divorce the free live-in nanny and bangmaid he doesn't even have to give money to EAT LUNCH to? He gets to look like the good guy that saved his niblings while travelling, going golfing, fishing, and to the gym and doing a job he loves, while you starve and slave yourself after him and tree kids you didn't even birth and pay everything for out of pocket. He lives a leasurly bachelor's life and doesn't even care enough about you to make sure you FREAKING EAT LUNCH, let alone have some sanity or free time. He'll never get a deal this sweet, because no one else will let themselves be walked over like this. How much do you think he'll last without you in the house? He'll never divorce you, tho he'll probably theathen to because he knows you'll fall for it. Seriously you're basic an indenture servant to this guy. I really need you to stop and consider how truly, seriously, deeply this guy couldn't give half a fuck about you. This is one of the most insane things I've ever read and I'm equal parts sad on your behalf and angry at you for allowing this, time to grow a spine.", "Why in the world are you putting up with this? It is clear he does not care that you are drowning for things HE wants. Why should he when you continue to do it? You have a choice: either you leave or you stay and it continues. Those are your choices as he frankly doesn\u2019t seem tgaf.", "OP, talk to a lawyer. There are many out there that will do a free consultation. You do this to gain the knowledge of what rights you have, especially regarding your kids. Of what can and/should be done so you can maintain custody of your children if you or your husband decide to go the divorce. Furthermore, the lawyer might be able to help you get in touch with resources in your area to assist with childcare or house cleaning.", "He wouldn't keep you from them because then he'd have to do more childcare. It doesn't sound like he's priority is to spend time with the kids when he's home.", "You need to adopt these children and then divorce this man. You and your kids would be better off.\n\nEdit: I know it's not this simple. Ignore the divorce part right now, and I hope your relationship improves, but it is clearly essential you and your husband adopt these children.", "Talk to a lawyer. You might see most of your fears disappear.", "NTA. How old are you and your husband? How long have you been married?", "Is there any way that his parents can help you or anyone on his side of the family could take the kids for even a lil while so you can get a short mommy break?", "NTA. He needs to pay for everything for the kids. Full stop. If not, you need to leave.", "Wait a minute. If you both adopted the kids, then they ARE your kids. And you would get a custody/parenting time agreement, and child support.", "Kid knows things are \"off\" when hes not around", "If the night terrors started after your husband went on the road, the 6 year old is probably having some abandonment issues, and likely needs therapy. Talk to your doctor about it.  \n\nYou should also talk to your doctor about your symptoms.   Crying all of the time is not normal.  You are likely very close to a complete burn out.  I know your husband is all about \u201csucking it up\u201d but you don\u2019t have to be.  Will he listen if your doctor tells him you need a break?", "What exactly are you getting out of this relationship? From what you write, it sounds like you are nothing more than a maid & a nanny without the perks. His treatment of you & those kids is abusive.", "You need to put these details into your post. Your actual situation is almost completely different from what your original post presents.", "By your husband, you are doing a massive favour that is giving you burnout. He should be paying for everything for his kids/niblings.", "INFO: did you two adopted them? What is the legal situation with the children?", "This isn't fair to you or to the kids. You need to get out. Force him to take full responsibility for his own choices.", "I didn\u2019t think this happened very much but I actually met someone who was a child in a secret family situation. He spotted his dad across town when was supposedly out of the country.", "Yep. I definitely think there\u2019s some infidelity going on on his end. In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a guarantee.", "An unpaid nanny who also supports the kids.", "I think it resonates with everyone because,  although I've only had my bf from 17-20 asking me to drop out of uni to become a housewife and all my partners afterwards have been self sufficient, I remember my grandma. We all have seen this even if we don't live it.", "He did convince me to go NC, but not for terrible reasons. My step dad did a lot of awful things to me as kid. My mom didn't believe me. Nor my bio dad or my sister. In my teens another girl came forward but everyone said she was a liar and that he would never. Then a few years ago ANOTHER person came forward. None of us are connected. None of us knew each other, but we are all lying. It enraged my husband.\n\nAt the same it was my mom and sister (my bio dad has since died). I felt like I couldn't live without them. I just pretended like nothing ever happened. I wouldn't go near my stepdad which meant I was never invited to any family functions or anything, but I'd still talk to and see my mom and sister from time to time. My mom loved the kids. But then that last person came out about my step dad and it brought everything back up, and my mom and sister were calling me a liar, everyone a liar. \n\nmy husband pretty much said I need to go NC with them cause if he ever saw them again he might do something terrible. He said it made him sick that I still had anything to do with them.", "Not even a sperm donor, those are his sister's kids...", "That\u2019s what I meant, the kids she loves and considers hers. She\u2019s scared to leave because she may have no legal access to them.", "That old job that got them in a mountain of debt because they didn\u2019t have enough money? The debt that he can now pay off with his new job?", "Reading so many similar stories on Reddit with women in these obviously abusive relationships and just totally in denial.. I\u2019m starting to have a hard time feeling any sympathy.\n\nEdit: a word", "Yep. And if OP doesn\u2019t take a break, her body will decide to take one for her.", "this is how I see it too. that his week \"home\" is really just a business trip from his second family. hes not even home when he is, because hes sleeping, watching tv, eating, out with friends. doing anything than spending time with her, helping with the kids or the house. \n\ni hope she wakes up and realizes she has nothing to be grateful for from him.", "He's got a other family.", "She sounds very isolated, no mention of family. But it'd be a good way out if it were possible. And yes, rather it wasn't her that breaks. She sounds so downtrodden and desperate.", "OP has stated that she is NC with her family, so she can't turn to them.", "Because she\u2019s dysfunctional enough that she lost custody of her kids. The odds she has a steady job are close to zero.", "At a job I was at years ago two of my coworkers had FILs that had secret families. It was insane.", "People definitely keep it under wraps, I just recently learned that my great grandpa had a secret family (in the 1940s/1950s) and I\u2019m almost 30.", "Eeek! She\u2019s the mistress taking care of his sisters kids so his wife doesn\u2019t have to. Or maybe they\u2019re his kids from his last mistress?", "That\u2019s so true, it reminded me of my mom", "You went from one abusive situation to another.\n\nThere are other ways to abuse someone besides what your stepdad did.\n\nYour husband is treating you like slave labor. He's discounting how you feel. He's out and out financially abusing you.", "She has no legal rights to them now. What happens when her husband decides in a year or so he wants out of the marriage and she has no legal claim to stay in their lives.  Her husband clearly doesn\u2019t care about what\u2019s best for the kids and wouldn\u2019t think twice about cutting her out of their lives. I would never agree to raise any children as my own that weren\u2019t mine without some kind of legal guardian agreement or adoption. I\u2019m surprised her husband hasn\u2019t been holding it over her that he can kick her out of their lives at will because unfortunately he could.", "Was that why? They live in a house so old it doesnt have washer or dryer hookups, unless it\u2019s in an extreme high COL area what does that mortgage look like? She completely covers groceries and child care, that leaves utilities (minus water/energy for laundry) and the mortgage, and some type of arbitrary debt payment that\u2019s yet to be defined by OP. He gives her literally, and absolutely no other money for her OR the kids. She can\u2019t see his account, I\u2019m curious to see if she can she their credit accounts either. I find it incredibly hard to believe there\u2019s no dishonestly associated with the debt payments.", "And... he can use part of that income to actually provide for his niblings, who are now taken care of, physically and financially by his wife.. solo.. on a shitty part time job, because she doesn't have time to get a better job.. because his nibblings.", "I wonder whether we'll see this on r/BestofRedditorUpdates soon...", "I doubt it will be a good ending, her latest comment shows that she's going to follow her husband no matter what, even if it destroys her. She believes she should be grateful for what he's done and has done, and that what he's doing is best for the family. \n\nIt's so sad to see bepople so brainwashed by their partners, that they're willing to make all the excuses and blame themselves. \n\nI hope she gets free from him and the kids.", "What the **fuck**.", "This is the most depressing post. I hope she wakes up.", "it really is, I hope she wakes up as well and realizes that it wont get better. it sucks for the kids but it sucks even more for her. she wont ever have a break until there 18, maybe if she doesnt leave now. she may end up taking care of capable adults if he refuses to make them get jobs and move out as well."]}
