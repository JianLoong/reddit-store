I don't have any family to help me. I don't have time for friends. It's never ending. Cleaning, kids, cooking, kids, dogs, dogs,  school, kids, cleaning cleaning kids CLEANING COOKING CLEANING. No time for me whatsoever.\n\nBefore my husband got this job we worked opposite schedules. I worked in a restaurant/bar in the evenings. Didnt pay great but a couple really good friends worked there with me. It was how I socialized. Now that he's gone, I couldn't work that job since nobody watches kids at night. Now I work a part time retail job I hate with what are essentially children (in comparison to me). I don't get to socialize like I used to. I only work the hours my kids are in school. But we have after school activities, homework, dogs, dinner, never ending chores, etc. THERE IS NO TIME FOR ME. I don't even get to sleep alone since my 6 year old has night terrors.\n\nWhen my husband was here, things felt more divided. I still did a lot during the day, but it wasn't never ending.

Time appears to be the more precious one to you, on which I happen to agree since time cannot be replaced. However, you can use money to pay for things that take away time from you. You can pay people to clean your home, do laundry, and even cook for you.

I\u2019m sure that all this is feeling like a nightmare. \n\nMy suggestion is for your husband to keep his job and to hire a nanny to help you at home.
