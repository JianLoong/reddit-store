Now we know why others have blocked her on socials.", "NTA.  She's your typical crazy cat lady.  Block her.", "This woman has a history of harassing people until they have no other recourse but to block her. Her checkups are against the organization's policy, so it's a wonder how she continues to foster cats for this organization. \n\nYou WNBTA if you blocked her.", "NTA. Call the rescue and report her again, and then block her every way you can. I have a contract with a breeder that explicitly states how often I will give updates and even I'd be uncomfortable with this woman's behavior. She's way too familiar and possessive of a cat you adopted *seven years ago*.", "Screen shot the message and send it to the organization telling them their foster is still harassing you then block the foster everywhere.", ". I have multiple pets both from previous owners and rescues. Some invested a lot of love and time into these animals and care deeply. I lost one yesterday and made sure to let the rescue where I got him from and where he spent a year know first because be hard to see first on SM. Owner of one follows there and again I'd let her know first. Updated previous owner of my first two for eight years but just an email every 6 months or so. \n\nI did get annoyed with one rescue I told before posting about their loss before I did. They had her six weeks but was lady's first foster so get her emotional involvement. Waited until emotion died down and set a boundary. \n\nYes, cat is your's but cat has a history and more than one person who loved them. It feels bit wrong to me to cut them off totally if expectation is email once or twice a year. When done rare foster - not suited to it - I do like an update when animal homed and offer back-up if something goes wrong.\n\nEdit to change judgement. NTA as against their policy so you don't need to do it. But get why she is asking. As to traumatic, kittens from bad places can crash hard. Two of mine are only alive because of nursing at the rescue.", "I personally wouldn\u2019t be bothered by it and certainly wouldnt get someone who loves cats so much booted from fostering.", "NTA should've blocked her long ago", "Just block her. NTA.", "Maybe this is her way of staying connected to the human population too? Like a human connection/potential friend? I think I'd be ok with ignoring/blocking though.", "NTA. If you literally never posted about the cat or she asked once in a blue moon/special cat occasion it'd be slightly different but you still wouldn't be a h.\n\nETA: she will only go back to bugging you about the cat do not engage", "YWNBTA at all. Technically all communication should have stopped once you were approved to make the adoption final. I would have never engaged with her to being with, but what\u2019s done is done. You decided when enough was enough and stuck to your limit. However, her reaching out now it absolutely off base. Block immediately.", "Eh I mean they probably do know that given the current owner has this information and did not mention a struggle to receive it and it\u2019s also equally likely it was just an accident. I think her behavior is overbearing and unreasonable for sure but unless cats are repeatedly being injured there\u2019s no reason to assume she\u2019s creating an unsafe environment for the cats themselves", "[cat tax!](https://imgur.com/a/7rduZo3)", "Your cat is so beautiful that Imgur warned me of a potential adult content \ud83e\udd23", "So beautiful!!", "Omg pretty cat!!", "What a beautiful face!", "Ywbta. It's one message in three years.

Id even threaten some court action so they nip this bs in the butt", "It really doesn't matter how the fosters or organizations feel tho. If OP feels intruded upon and like it's overstepping then that's what it is, regardless of intention. They didn't sign up to make an extended family with this person, they adopted a cat to be a part of their family. Obviously if the foster followed social media she could see that the cat was alive and well, not sure why she'd need more than that.", "Yeah... she sounds a little nutty but honestly just loves the cats and really wants to make sure they are well.

I'm a dog foster, and thank God so many of my adopters are free with updates. When you take care of an animal,  you firm a bond and the kind thing to do would be just tell her the cat is happy.", "NTA.  I would block that lady and send a screen shot to the organization. This would have weirded me out the first time.", "NTA.  I foster puppies and love every one.  I ask my adopters to provide periodic updates if they don't mind, because not every day in rescue is a happy, uplifting experience and those happily ever after updates remind us why we keep doing it on the bad days.  But I only contact the adopter during the first couple of months to make sure they're settling in well and don't have any questions or need guidance.  What this foster is doing is incredibly intrusive.", "NTA", "NTA. and you kitty is very pretty. But here's the thing. She's with an organization. The organization has a VERY clear policy regarding contacting the parents of furbabies, which this person has repeatedly broken, not just with you, but with multiple other adopters. You need to report her AGAIN to the agency. And then block away.", "NTA.  It is creepy, and she was told to stop and reached out again anyway.  Block her.  Enough is enough.", "NTA. She\u2019s a creep. She needs to stop fostering if she\u2019s going to get attached and harass people.  Send the message to the agency again. Tell you you\u2019re feeling scared of her.", "NTA. You don\u2019t. Have to keep yourself in an uncomfortable position to be kind and \u201cnot rude.\u201d You\u2019ve established boundaries and she violated them. I get that she loves your cat, but then she should\u2019ve kept the cat instead of giving/selling her to you.", "Agreed. FWIW, I regularly update and still get occasional texts from the couple I adopted my dog from. The difference is that it's mutual and doesn't make me uncomfortable for them to ask about him. Since you've made it clear you aren't comfortable with this, YWNBTA for blocking her and talking to the agency again.", "Omg what a precious baby!!", "NTA. Thank you for the gorgeous pet tax!", "I agree if that was the policy of place and made clear. Just explaining the other side and why personally I'd never rehome. Every rescuer has more than one story of a homing that went wrong and ended up with a dead or badly injured/ traumatised animal. And it is not extended family that is wanted or necessarily following on social media. That would be way too intrusive. It is a text once a year saying all is well or not.", "Personally, I would find that intrusive. Why do you get to check in when it's my cat now? Everyone is different, which is my point.", "Because if you have read your contract,quite often an adoption is not the same as buying a cat. Cat remains chipped to rescue, cat needs returned if circumstances changed, and some do have a home check-up a month, six months and year after homing. Though know breeders who have similar terms in their contracts.", "Good lord, that's too much work, i have never heard of any of that and don't know why anyone would agree to that. Also, breeders are an ethical nightmare with so many animals needing homes.\n\n When I was getting my cat, the rescue almost forgot to charge me they were so focused on getting him out the door. There are plenty of places that don't require such invasive policies to adopt a pet, and I'll be sure to be on the lookout in the future if this is a thing now.", "NTA but what's so wrong with appeasing an old lady who likes your pet? Is it different if it's a neighbor inquiring and asking for updates? Even that last message she sent was sweet. Redditors saying she overstepped, yes she did but I think you're overreacting to it. She's not showing up at your house or anything like that. She actually took care of your furbaby before you became the pet parent.", "NTA. I would forward her latest message to the organization, letting them know this hasn't stopped even though she's clearly aware she shouldn't do it, and then block her.  (Probably no point in conversing w/ her about it.)  \n\n\nEven if she means well in her own way, it's time.", "YWNBTA - She was told by the organization that it was against policy. It is very creepy and you need to stop allowing her to have access to you/the cat. The Foster did their part, now you are doing yours by loving on the fur baby. \n\nBlock away and keep on loving the kitty", "NTA. This is weird behavior from her.", "this, i don't really see the big deal of her messaging every once in awhile, have people just forgotten about social skills", "Oh a tortie\ud83d\ude3b I\u2019m kind of partial to torties as my kitty is one too.", "Look, I foster cats regularly, and once a year or two, I'll reach out to past fosters and ask how the cats are doing and that I'd love to see a picture...\n\nNow, getting messaged every couple months is a lot... but you can't send her a photo once every 3 years? I've never had an adopter not want to send me a photo of their kitties, most love to share an update and send me a half dozen...\n\nI don't know, maybe this lady is overbearing or something... but I'm having trouble seeing your side of this and why you're so upset... lol, you sent us a picture here, can't send the same to her?", ">but unless cats are repeatedly being injured\n\nShe describes *multiple* traumatic injuries. I've had cats for 30 years now, without a single injury I'd describe as traumatic.", "Multiple injuries that could have happened in one incident. Sometimes shit happens dude injuries don\u2019t only occur due to malice or neglect sometimes life just happens.", "NTA\n\nThe org needs to know so they can step in and do something about it. It may not bother some but it's foster's like this that they have the rule in the first place. I wouldn't mind someone checking in once a year for the first few years but after that, it's creepy and uncomfortable and I'd block her and move on after letting the foster org know.", "You should have blocked and reported her a long time ago. That she contacted you after she was warned, but knowing it's against policy says she has something wrong with her. NTA Creepy.", "Sometimes I am afraid to be on the other side lol. I got my cat from a rescuer and that was i think 3 years back? I still sometimes send that lady a picture or short video when it is super cute. I just want her to know she has a good life here. But she never complained and always seemed happy about the updates.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t be a foster care (mom?) if she can\u2019t handle letting the animals go.", "NTA, but just block her already.", "Yep, I would even forward a copy of the email she just sent.", "OMG she's gorgeous.  Remind me of my cat Polly with the line down the middle of her face.  I bet she's got that silky soft fur, too.", "She really does.  She\u2019s a tiny tiny cat for her age, and she\u2019s ridiculously soft.  Photo of yours?", "This. So much this. I have 2 100lb BIG dogs and 11 (yes you read that right) cats. \n\nI have never had a single animal in my care receive a traumatic injury. Let alone MULTIPLE ones.\n\nSomething feels very wrong there.", "Idk if I did this right.  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/OPp7Tlp", "It also feels unfair to blame the foster carer. Maybe those injuries occurred before the kitty was in her care, hence why she needed to be in foster care in the first place. Sure, she\u2019s being overbearing, but that\u2019s no reason to assume she hurt the poor baby even unintentionally", "Yeah it did!  Adorable!  Thank you.", "My sentiments exactly :)", "I would explain her behaviour to her and why it's inappropriate before blocking. Maybe she'll learn.\nNTA", "NTA. That behavior is super inappropriate. As someone who volunteers with an animal shelter, I get attached to a lot of cats, I'm delighted when their people update, and I would NEVER attempt to contact someone unless it had been explicitly welcomed. A lot of people in sheltering work get very invested and sometimes overstep their boundaries. She's clearly doing this to other people and the rescue needs to let her know it's not okay, and work on placing cats she fosters in a way that protects the privacy of adopters.", "Don\u2019t block her YET.

Give your torti a hug from me!", "NTA. As a foster carer we love them like our own but know that they aren\u2019t ours forever and we will have to let them go.\n\nI LOVE receiving updates from adoptees but I would never message them first - I decided not to adopt them and a big part of that is knowing that I may never receive an update again. I have my memories, photos and videos to look back on when I miss them! \n\n You have done all the right things and the fact that she has been told to stop by both you and the rescue is a major red flag.\n\nBlock away!", "Ywbta. \n\nY\u2019all are goofy and rude af. Literally like, just ignore the messages. There isn\u2019t anything inherently creepy about what she is doing (at least in the way you relayed it). She clearly cares and loves the animals; she doesn\u2019t give a f about you. \n\nAs a foster, it\u2019s so weird when ppl adopt and go radio silent. I love when I get updates on how the animals are doing (especially if I\u2019ve communicated them being particularly meaningful). While I personally don\u2019t bother with reaching out after it\u2019s clear the other people don\u2019t want to give updates, it always irritates me. I\u2019d be so grateful to keep in touch with whoever saved/ cared for my rescue, and loved them as much as I do. Rescuing is a community effort. Don\u2019t be an asshole", "I send the amazing woman who fostered my void girl pictures every once in a while. She's extra spicy, so her foster mom was worried she'd have a hard time getting adopted. She's a homicidal maniac unless she actively likes you, so I get it, and I'm happy she loves us and her groomer. 10 years later, and I'll still send a picture of her being more cute than usual (I swear, I only send maybe one a year now). I worry that I'm bugging her, but she's always said she likes seeing her happy and sassy.", "Right this is literally my thought! Like, why are you being a narc towards someone who clearly is kinda ND/ strongly cares for animals. As long as she\u2019s not being weird to the humans involved like\u2026 chill and just be kind or just ignore it jeez", "They could have also been related to other things. I just finished fostering out one who got calici from her vaccine, then a hernia from her spay, then the surgery to correct the hernia turned into a seroma..and then she got ringworm from her brother who was dormant for 5 weeks. She was my medical case for most of her time with me and none of it had to do with me. \n\nBut also, as a foster, when someone adopts my cats that's it. I give them my number if they have questions or WANT to send me updates but I would never reach out to them. It's their baby now. This woman should reconsider if fostering is right for her if she cannot separate role from the animals."]}
