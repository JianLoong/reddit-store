I get that she probably cares about the kitty, but part of fostering is giving up the kitty.  It's one thing to check in every now and again, but this is a little disturbing.  Especially since she was asked not to contact you by the foster organization.", "YWNBTA:  \nFoster parents sometimes get super attached to an animal they're caring for. When that happens they either adopt or learn to let the animal go.\n\nReport her again to the foster agency. It's also concerning that the cat while a kitten had a couple of traumatic injuries. The rescue group should know that. She is either fostering too many animals or has an unsafe environment for them.", "You have the patience of a saint. Yes, block her, and tell the organization she reached out to you again.  \n\nNTA.", "No, you WNBTA. This person has been told by other adopters and by the head of the organization not to do exactly what she\u2019s doing. You should feel free to block her if you would feel more comfortable not hearing from her again.", "NTA you checked with the rescue and it\u2019s against their policy. Social media is for friends, business associates etc., and those YOU choose to stay in touch with, not a random volunteer from a rescue! Feel free to block her, she obviously continues to overstep boundaries that both you and the rescue has set!  Glad your kitty is doing well!  Cat tax??", "YWNBTA\n\nContacting the family after the kitten / cat had been adopted is against their policy for a reason. I\u2019m not sure how long she has been with the organization, but she may have been the cause of that policy being baked in.\n\nI get that bonds can form, especially with caring for injuries and the like, watching them grow and thrive. It\u2019s a super important job I could never do.

Now we know why others have blocked her on socials.", "NTA.  She's your typical crazy cat lady.  Block her.", "This woman has a history of harassing people until they have no other recourse but to block her. Her checkups are against the organization's policy, so it's a wonder how she continues to foster cats for this organization. \n\nYou WNBTA if you blocked her.", "NTA. Call the rescue and report her again, and then block her every way you can. I have a contract with a breeder that explicitly states how often I will give updates and even I'd be uncomfortable with this woman's behavior. She's way too familiar and possessive of a cat you adopted *seven years ago*.", "Screen shot the message and send it to the organization telling them their foster is still harassing you then block the foster everywhere.", ". I have multiple pets both from previous owners and rescues. Some invested a lot of love and time into these animals and care deeply. I lost one yesterday and made sure to let the rescue where I got him from and where he spent a year know first because be hard to see first on SM. Owner of one follows there and again I'd let her know first. Updated previous owner of my first two for eight years but just an email every 6 months or so. \n\nI did get annoyed with one rescue I told before posting about their loss before I did. They had her six weeks but was lady's first foster so get her emotional involvement. Waited until emotion died down and set a boundary. \n\nYes, cat is your's but cat has a history and more than one person who loved them. It feels bit wrong to me to cut them off totally if expectation is email once or twice a year. When done rare foster - not suited to it - I do like an update when animal homed and offer back-up if something goes wrong.\n\nEdit to change judgement. NTA as against their policy so you don't need to do it. But get why she is asking. As to traumatic, kittens from bad places can crash hard. Two of mine are only alive because of nursing at the rescue.", "I personally wouldn\u2019t be bothered by it and certainly wouldnt get someone who loves cats so much booted from fostering.", "NTA should've blocked her long ago", "Just block her. NTA.", "Maybe this is her way of staying connected to the human population too? Like a human connection/potential friend? I think I'd be ok with ignoring/blocking though.", "NTA. If you literally never posted about the cat or she asked once in a blue moon/special cat occasion it'd be slightly different but you still wouldn't be a h.\n\nETA: she will only go back to bugging you about the cat do not engage", "YWNBTA at all. Technically all communication should have stopped once you were approved to make the adoption final. I would have never engaged with her to being with, but what\u2019s done is done. You decided when enough was enough and stuck to your limit. However, her reaching out now it absolutely off base. Block immediately.", "Eh I mean they probably do know that given the current owner has this information and did not mention a struggle to receive it and it\u2019s also equally likely it was just an accident. I think her behavior is overbearing and unreasonable for sure but unless cats are repeatedly being injured there\u2019s no reason to assume she\u2019s creating an unsafe environment for the cats themselves", "[cat tax!](https://imgur.com/a/7rduZo3)", "Your cat is so beautiful that Imgur warned me of a potential adult content \ud83e\udd23", "So beautiful!!", "Omg pretty cat!!", "What a beautiful face!", "Ywbta. It's one message in three years. Your cat might not even be alive if not for people willing to foster it. \n\nJust type a message out and send the imgur link you literally shared in this thread to her and move on.

Id even threaten some court action so they nip this bs in the butt", "It really doesn't matter how the fosters or organizations feel tho. If OP feels intruded upon and like it's overstepping then that's what it is, regardless of intention. They didn't sign up to make an extended family with this person, they adopted a cat to be a part of their family. Obviously if the foster followed social media she could see that the cat was alive and well, not sure why she'd need more than that.", "Yeah... she sounds a little nutty but honestly just loves the cats and really wants to make sure they are well.

I highly doubt she meant it in a creepy way.", "Same!", "Imgur didn\u2019t warn me; I\u2019m feeling judged."]}
