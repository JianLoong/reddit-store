They are her kids, if her childcare falls through she is responsible for finding care for them; not relying on her sister to bail her out.

You are right to point out that you have your own family to look after. I think you need to tell her that either you work on a deal where you take turns when kids are sick (meaning she takes a day off when your kids are too!) or you just basically worry about each of your respective children.

As a mother myself, it\u2019s my responsibility to get care for my kid or to take the day off work if I need. I would never expect someone else to take off work to watch my kid for me. She\u2019s taking advantage of you.", "You are doing the work they should be doing. Start saying no.", "NTA\n\nYour sister needs to figure out her own child care and not impact your job and PTO by making you her default child care option if her daycare has an issue.", "NTA- I don\u2019t know how flexible your workplace is, but most places wouldn\u2019t keep someone around if they constantly call in. You have your own family to take care of and if you\u2019re not getting paid when you call off for them you\u2019re losing out on money. If her husband works from home he can take care of the kids, you said in a comment he brags about only working two hours a day, if his schedule allows it he can put the 6 month old down for a nap and then do his work while the child is napping he wouldn\u2019t really have to worry about parenting and working since the child would be asleep. You should not be expected to drop everything to take care of someone else\u2019s kids.", "NTA. But try asking her to take a day off to babysit your kids and if she refused then tell her you are no longer babysitting her kids unless she is willing to pay you the minimum wage. And make sure she pays it in advance.", "I can't believe you are in any doubt as to your right to say no to this. Are you going to wonder if you were TA when you lose your job over it? When you have to take a slice of money out of your family's income thereby costing your children and your husband? No is a complete sentence and requires no explanation. But,if you think she needs one  then tell her that your job is as important to you as hers and her husband's and the gravy train is over. NTA.", "NTA\nAs much as you may love your nephews, they are not your problem. It is acceptable to take care of them 1 or 2 times during an emergency but I think your sister and BIL are taking advantage of you. Unfortunately having children is a big responsibility and if they wanted to have them, in the first place, they should have considered who would take care of them when parents are not at home. Let them hire someone to do the job, you have enough on your hands with your own job and family to worry about someone else.", "NTA. Why doesn\u2019t she take off work? They\u2019re her kids. Stop doing that.", "NTA. Just tell her you don\u2019t have anymore PTO to spare. And since it\u2019s none of her business what else you\u2019re using your PTO for, it\u2019s not a lie - you need to use the rest for yourself, not her kids.", "Nta. When you decide to have kids you should think about daycare babysitting etc. You are not a free babysitter when it is inconvenient for your sister. You are also a wife, also have children and you have a job as well. You can\u2019t pause your life and work because your sister doesn\u2019t have a babysitter. You als matter. Just say NO and tell them that if they can\u2019t look after the children themself than they shouldn\u2019t have had a baby to begin with.", "NTA. Why should you have to take time off work to babysit her kids. That is the responsibility of your sister and her husband", "NTA.  Real and serious emergencies excepted, you seriously need to stop enabling them by agreeing to mind their kids with little to no notice.  Tell them to find a babysitter.  It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to expect you miss a day of work and lose pay so you can drive an hour out of your way to babysit for free, or even worse, be kicked out of your own house so your BIL can Bogart your home office.", "NTA she taking major advantage of you and she knows it. That\u2019s why she tricked you one time to get you to do it. You\u2019ve got to put you\u2019re foot down and just tell her no because is she going to pay your bills if you get fired for taking off to watch her kids for free??", "NTA. \"Sis, you pushing your kids on me so that you and your hubs can work, not lose your jobs, and not put your family in distress is causing the very problem you are avoiding yourselves for me, and I can't do that anymore for my own family's sake as I'm not willing to lose my own job do to failure to work and put my own family in distress and peril. I'm sorry but I will no longer babysit for you, especially not at a moments notice. Do not even consider driving by and just dropping the kids off thinking I'll take care of them because I WILL call the police regarding child abandonment.\" This will tell her the reasons that her free childcare is no longer available, and lays out a consequence for ignoring your boundary (which she and her hubby will undoubtedly try to stomp all over because they won't appreciate losing their free childcare and being able to continue with their lives as it would be without the kiddos underfoot). It will be a harsh lesson for her and her husband, but this sounds like a situation where tough love is necessary.", "YTA.  Just say no, you have your own family and a job.", "They just straight up say it\u2019s too much work for him to parent and work even though he brags about working about two hours at most most days\u2026", "Ah I\u2019m sorry baby is 6months the oldest is 2 years old not 12months.", "I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ll fix the ages baby is 6months oldest is 2 years old.", "No my sisters way of thinking is we are family so you should just do it.", "Remind him about how he brags about working only 2 hours, meaning they have 22 hours to work with.\n\nEither he's lying about working so little or is just lazy.\n\nBeing a parent means signing up for \"too much\". If they can choose to have kids then they agree to the consequences.", "As a big sister myself (I have six younger siblings) I fully understand the \"need\" to be there and responsible/helpful (especially if parents were of the \"you're their big sister it's your job to look after them\" variety)\n\nIf it was too much work to parent, they should have worked out other managing methods by now. (Not going to comment on number of kids or times apart, I have no way of knowing circumstances around that to make an informed judgement) It's been a year with one child, six months with two, that's long enough to have found a babysitter by now, or learnt new management methods.\n\nNot wanting to or it being too hard is not an excuse.\n\nEven if you didn't have kids you are NTA.\nYou need to put you and your family first, if you're happy to look after your nephews under certain circumstances set those out, (of course in an actual emergency I'll step in) or hey on the first Sunday of the month I'll watch your kids for date night and the third Sunday you watch mine.\n\nYour sister and her partner both sound like A.Hs.\nHim for his attitude towards his OWN children, her for condoning it.", "Then they shouldn\u2019t have had kids if it\u2019s too much for him.

Give it a go and see what happens.", "No, sorry, I have to work that day too\u2026 is a perfectly acceptable and complete answer. \nNTA", "NTA. I'm really confused. In your sister's brain it's okay for you to take time off work to care for her child, but she doesn't have to take time off to take care of her own. WTF?\n\nTaking time off work that you might not be able to afford is part of being a parent. They are the parents. They have to figure out a way to handle this that doesn't include inconveniencing you. Whether mom stays home or dad has the day off, that's their problem to work out. You help when you can, but not to your own detriment.", "NTA. Inform them they need to make arrangements for their childcare just as you do for your kids and that you will not jeopardize your employment or money for them. Next time they show up refuse to let them in. You'll have to have a hard boundary with them.", "NTA\n\nStop sitting for them at all.  It's their responsibility to arrange good childcare and to have an appropriate back up plan.", "NTA as you said you have your own family and job and life to deal with.", "I will add don't endanger your job and your  children  security for your  sister and b8l poor decisions.  They are the parents they need to figure it out alone.
