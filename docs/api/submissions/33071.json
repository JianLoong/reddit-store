It\u2019s easier to teach appropriate behavior than unteach bad habits. Laughing will just encourage her to please you.\n\nYour brother should have given you a chance to speak, and even when you didn\u2019t teach her a more appropriate response should not have called you an AH in front of your child. Perhaps you didn\u2019t have the best parenting examples growing up and are overcompensating with leniency. A parenting class or book can\u2019t hurt. There are ones that teach positive parenting while still providing structure for your child if that\u2019s the case. Edit words.", ">My brother looked at me angrily and called me an asshole and told me I should punish her for the way she talked to him.\n\nWell he's right, your daughter had a point in that he doesn't get to tell her what to do. The way she communicated that was repugnant. Especially to someone in whose house she is a guest. You're living there temporarily, it's his home. \n\nYta\n\nEta:\n\nOPs brother is the permanent resident therefore OP is the guest in the brother's house. We don't know the circumstances for why the brother still lives with his parents. It could be financial, it could be helping out his parents.", "YTA, that is some seriously entitled behavior from your daughter", "YTA\n\nThat was really rude of your daughter. You should have said something.\n\nEdit - the AH vote is for the lack of direction and course correction OP could have made. The brother didn't do anything so bad to warrant that kind of snapback and OP could have used this to tell his daughter how to communicate when someone does something to upset her.", "YTA\n\nIf you support this behavior, your daughter will become a cheeky brat", "I'm in the minority here but... your brother overstepped. It's not his place to question your daughter about her homework. Yes what she said was rude, but if he had minded his own business and let you parent your own kid then she wouldn't have said anything. \n\nMaybe instead of punishing her sit her down And talk to her about why what she said was not ok. Talk to her about how to handle situations like that better. And then maybe talk to your brother about minding his own business and not parenting your kid.", "If you thought that was funny, wait 'til she starts treating you the same.", "ESH\n\n1) your daughter should NOT be addressing ANYONE in that manner. \n\n2) your brother had no right to butt in with the whole \"homework\" thing, and also the demand on punishment. Thank gods he's not a father. Children/people should never be \"punished\". There's lesson moments that are met with discussions and/or consequences. Not \"punishment\".\n\n3) you should be addressing your child's behavior, even if it was \"funny\" in the moment.", "Your brother was asking her a question related to her statement of being bored. He was, quite literally, encouraging her to get homework done and out of the way as a solution to her boredom. I don\u2019t read that as him telling her what to do. He asked IF she did it and suggested she do her homework first. I am not clear on how, as a parent, you are bothered by your brother encouraging her to complete something for her own benefit - her own schooling/academic achievement. His question, which really serves to benefit HER, being met with \u201cdid I ask you? \u2026mind your own business?\u201d is over the line. You nearly laughing and outwardly agreeing with her \u201cpoint\u201d is also over the line. You are showing her that it\u2019s ok, and even humorous to respond rudely to people. So what was her point? That he shouldn\u2019t ask about and encourage her with regard to her schooling/academics? \u2026 Reinforcing this stuff will only make it worse. Your brother lashing out at you instead of expressing his concern about it in a reasonable way is definitely not necessary either. But his point that you should be addressing her rude behaviour is not wrong imo. \n\nYour daughter reacted unnecessarily rude. Children need to be taught effective and respectful communication by their parents. I will say that, as a teacher, I see the impact that this leniency from parents has. The thing is, your kids don\u2019t just limit it to your brother. They begin to think it\u2019s acceptable to talk to anyone this way. My literal job is, in part, to ask students if they have completed their work and to encourage them to do the work. I have found in recent years that kids are far more disrespectful and combative and it\u2019s making the job unbearable at times. As teachers, we can only do so much to support your child in succeeding throughout the school year AND to teach your child acceptable social skills, because they really do take what they learn at home with them (like: seeing their work as unimportant/unnecessary, and being just downright and needlessly disrespectful in their responses to people or in conservation). \n\nYTA.", "NTA. Given the way your brother jumped in to try and parent your kid in front of you, I'm going to guess this isn't the first time he's done so. I imagine your daughter's getting a little frustrated with him butting in and so she told him off. Could she have been more polite? Probably. Would he have listened if she was? Probably not.", "Acting as a parent when the parents present. Then using a expletive  to describe the child\u2019s parent. The brother lit the fuse here. Needs to MYOB and STFU.", "Your daughter has a point. She didn't ask him, he wasn't in charge of watching her or being her guardian. He interjected in trying to tell her what to do and I think she had an appropriate answer. Was it sassy? Yes. Did he deserve it? Also yes. Could she of been nicer? Probably. But I think this is your daughter's way of telling your brother to mind his boundaries and he crossed one of hers. Her sticking up for herself now will help when she gets older. \n\nNTA.", "YTA I don\u2019t think she can be that \u201csweet\u201d if she\u2019s just saying the first thing that comes to mind. She\u2019s old enough to learn basic manners. Also laughing and agreeing with her is telling her it\u2019s okay to be rude to other people.", "YTA.\n\nYour child is going to grow up into an unlikeable asshole", "YTA\n\nI can see the post when your daughter is 12.  She keeps sassing me, talking back, swearing and won't stop.  What can I do?\n\nIt's this moment when you should have laid down rules.", "It's really hard to get mad at her when she was 100% correct.  The plus side is she seems to be willing to stand up for herself and that is good. NTA, but maybe a conversation about times when it's ok to be cheeky and when it's best to chose your words wisely.", "YTA, you find it cute and funny now (and trust me it\u2019s not) but it will come back to bite you in the ass in a few years if you don\u2019t correct this behavior RIGHT NOW", "YTA.\n\nThere is a polite way in which everyone should speak to each other. This includes kids to adults, kids to kids, adults to kids, etc. What your daughter said was rude. You are not raising a well adjusted child, if she thinks that this is acceptable. Wait until she\u2019s older, and tires this attitude on with someone who actually can issue her a consequence.", "NTA. Being a guest in someone's house does not give them the right to tell another individual how to manage their time, what order to eat their food, or how to dress unless the parent tells the brother and child that this is the agreed dynamic. Your brother sounds like he just wanted to assert he's not lowest in the pecking order.", "Laughing is encouragement for children. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re the AH, but you might be raising one. Food for thought.", "NTA, not only does your brother not get to dictate in what order your daughter does her homework or homework plays,  he also has no say in when and how she should be disciplined. I would keep a very close eye on him over this visit, that level of controlling behavior over you daughter when you are around makes me very concerned about how he would act towards her when you aren\u2019t.", "ESH. Your daughter was disrespectful. You failed as a parent by laughing and because you should have been asking that question. And your brother sucks because he was trying to be the parent you aren\u2019t when he is not, in fact, the parent.  His last comment is quite telling, so step up and BE a parent.", "Nta.  Not his kid not his place to interject.  His comment about kids having kids is hilarious too.  28 years old and still living with mommy has no room to talk.  Grow up and get out.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA. For the rest of that kid\u2019s life the world is going to try to beat that assertiveness and spunkiness out of her. Being a bitch is a good skill for a girl to have and I think it should be cultivated in childhood before the world has a chance to knock her down", "NTA. Good for you for raising a daughter who knows how to stand up for herself. The number of times I\u2019ve had some man who thinks he knows best answer a question I didn\u2019t ask him!! She is destined for great things. Nice job dad!", "ESH. I will admit I was laughing when I read this. And well, I think what she said was correct you need to talk to her about not quite saying it like that. And your brother needs to back off he\u2019s not her father he doesn\u2019t get to tell her to do her homework first. It\u2019s none of his business if her homework is done or not.", "NTA \n\nIm gonna start off, i once said a similar response to your daughter, the reason i said it was simple, i was a precious 8yr and i was sick and tired of adults who werent my parent, parenting me, id ask to go out and people would jump to 'did you clean up' 'did you do your homework' and then my mons response would change, from what i knew was a yes, to a 'listen to aunt/uncle' or 'respect aunt/uncle' but the thing is, i didnt respect them, i hated them, they were always getting in my way, constantly parenting me but they arent my parent, and so one day i snapped, i got ounished for it, and what that taught me, was that my parent cared more about what adults feelings were and what they said, and not what my feelings were or how upset i was that every time i moved a muscle i had an adult breathing down my neck that should not have authority over me.\n\nSo im guessing your daughter might be in a similar mind set, and if you punish her, instead of talking to her, then you will set the idea in her head that adults matter more then her, that her uncles opinions and feelings matter more then hers. That adults, any adult can tell her what to do and she should shut up and obey, and at 9 she can absolutely understand this. If you punish her you will be the asshole, talk to her, have a conversation, maybe have her apologize but that apology should be something like this 'uncle, im sorry i snapped, but you arent my parent and id prefer you stop trying to be one'", "NTA - another adult is not an authority figure just because they're an adult. IMO teaching her to stand up for herself when appropriate is more important than teaching her she has to respect authority because it is authority.\n\nTo be clear: I don't think that what she said was appropriate, but if a 28 year old man's response to being talked back to by a 9 year old is to start shouting and demand punishment at their parent then *they* should not be encouraged to think they *are* an authority figure in that child's life. Like that is a wildly disproportionate response to a nine year old being sassy. At *best* it warranted a conversation about what is respectful behavior toward your brother in your mother's home.\n\nTLDR: He's not allowed to parent your daughter because you both happen to be in the home he lives in unless you allow him to, and you clearly don't", "NTA!!!! and i say this as someone who works with kids on the daily. she didn't cuss, she didn't call him names, her uncle overstepped and she corrected him. i think people forget that 9 year olds are basically mini humans who don't like to be told what to do. you generally need to earn their respect in order to get to get them to behave how you want them to, instead of according to what they want to do. it doesn't sound like uncle has a great relationship with her, so it's great that he gets to learn that you don't get to order someone around just because they're a) a child, and b) family. why should she be punished for exerting her rights to a personality and choice of people she feels get to tell her what to do?", "Woooo.... your kid is a class A brat & you just let her..  YTA  \n\nWell it may not have been his place say that to her ( I don't see the problem) its sure the hell isn't cute to see a mouth kid over step & she over stepped.  Good luck with your little thug", "Yta \n\nIt\u2019s not the words, it\u2019s the tone/intent. She said those words **disrespectfully** to an adult. She could have said something like \u201cmom and I don\u2019t usually do homework until after dinner\u201d or something else significantly less hostile. Allowing her to treat adults like that is teaching her that mean words/disrespect  go unpunished and is no big deal. So YTA for your parenting imo.", "ESH. \n\nI would absolutely not \u201cpunish\u201d my kid for this but I would have a discussion about how even if what she said was true or even if it was a joke (my kid with adhd would totally say that as a joke before thinking it through), it\u2019s not appropriate to speak like that to adults. \n\nI would let your brother know that he is not responsible for parenting your daughter, and that unless he\u2019s babysitting, he needs to remember that you are the parent here. She asked her parent a question, not her uncle. While she shouldn\u2019t have said it that way, it was true. \n\nMy 9 year old says and does some crazy things sometimes. We talk a lot about what is appropriate or not and unless something is done repeatedly and intentionally we don\u2019t punish, we teach.", "NTA\u2014why is she as a child more responsible for how she talked to him than he is for how he talked to her? It was rude of him to address her before you could.", "NTA\nIt was funny and accurate. You've raised a young girl who can already stand up for herself and I don't see anything wrong with that. \nOkay maybe the delivery could have been a bit smoother but I think your brother is just pissed he got outsmarted by a 9yo. You're raising a strong young girl, nicely done.", "Yta, and should be ashamed your daughter talked that way to an adult. If I were you I would nip it in the bud before this becomes a problem for her in her adult life.", "YTA and you\u2019re going to turn your daughter into one too if you\u2019re not careful. Wouldn\u2019t accept someone being spoken to like that from someone of any age. Especially when his concern of her homework actually benefits her and he was trying to help and show concern. Maybe you and your daughter should learn a bit from your brother and sort your shit out.", "YTA, your daughter should have been taught better manners than that.  The fact that you don\u2019t see this shows the problem\u2019s genesis", "NTA. Your brother should know better than to try to parent somebody else's child. He should have taken her cheeky response in stride.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You were the A to let her comments ride without correction. Your brother is an adult and so are you; she is a child who needs guidance in appropriate inter-personal communication.

However, the response from the child is also wildly inappropriate - if nieces response was:\n \"I was asking to play with my mom, not you uncle\" then I think it would warrant some of the feedback I'm getting for my answer. \n\nHowever I would have a major problem if I suggested a child/my niece do their schoolwork upon getting home so the rest of the day they are free to play and got the response uncle got here. \n\nWe can disagree with the methods, but this response sounds like it's something they heard from mom, and not a way I'd want my child talking to another adult.", "YTA.

She said it's none of his business and in my opinion- it's not because it isn't his child.

Your brother should have let you parent your child instead of sticking himself in a situation that was in no way his business. Your daughter was asking you if she could play, not him, just as she should do. In my opinion, that was very rude of him.\n\nHowever, I also think you should encourage your daughter to have more of a filter. The unfortunate reality is sometimes you have to hold your tongue in life and that is a skill your daughter needs to learn. I really don\u2019t like idea that children should just respect all adults, adults should be respectful back and your brother clearly wasn\u2019t that. However, your daughter was way more rude than the situation called for. She should have let you deal with your brother ideally, or at least left it as, \u201c I asked my mother\u201d.", "Agreed.

And then he just went ahead and insulted OP too.\n\nBut that was a hella rude thing to say and goes beyond just \"speaking her mind.\" She needs to learn more appropriate ways of pushing back on people who try to overstep their authority or bully her due to being perceived as weaker or subordinate. Just because she was right doesn't mean that she was helpful or effective.

Dad was home, so he should have kept his mouth shut.\n\nYou expecting kids to come home from school to do MORE school without a break from school is also what's wrong.

It wasn\u2019t the brother\u2019s place to jump in and tell her to do her homework, but that kind of response makes it a much bigger deal than it needs to be. \n\nDad needs to have two conversations right now. Conversation 1 is where he tells his brother not to overstep and try to parent somebody else\u2019s child when that interference is not necessary or wanted. Conversation 2 is where he talks with his daughter about more polite ways to respond if something like this happens again. Ideally, you want to save the bigger and ruder responses for the really big stuff, and brainstorm some scripts to use for the smaller stuff that gets your point across without burning all your bridges. It\u2019s a good skill for a kid to learn, and her dad can help her make a plan for how to react to future problems.", "I\u2019ve absolutely said stuff like this to my kids. You have to teach kids how to respond properly.", "How about something like this.\n\nWoah, not okay. Granted you\u2019re right that he had no business saying what he did, but you are way out of line in how you spoke to him. Apologize for being so rude and disrespectful. \n\n* then after the apology tell brother in front of daughter that brother doesn\u2019t get to parent OP\u2019s child over non safety issues. then proceed to ignore brother and do what OP would have originally done with his daughter had brother not so rudely stepped in.", "Yeah, 100%. Teaching your kid to have a nuanced understanding of social decorum is important. Brother should have known it wasn\u2019t his place to ask that way, and kiddo should understand that sometimes grownups mess up, but kiddo also needs to learn how to respond in a measured and polite way, or else she\u2019ll grow up rude.", "If OP dont want the people talk to his daughter, he should not visit people with his daughter.", "Not that deep, she made a statement, he offered a solution. It wasn't intruding or micromanaging.", "[deleted]", "I'm honestly baffled by how people here are just jumping straight to y t a and only focusing on how rude the daughter was vs why she said what she said. \n\nYes, there are other ways to respond to stuff like that but she's also 9 and her response is not necessarily wrong either. The brother was sticking his nose somewhere that it doesn't belong.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if this is a common theme for the brother and the daughter has picked up on it and doesn't like hearing her dad be talked to like that.", "Edit: the first part of this is wrong but I\u2019ll leave it up for context. It should say \u201cnot understandable and\u201d but I made a shitty assumption. \n\u201cKids having kids\u201d is understandable but weird for the brother to be sassy about life choices given his own. If daughter is 9, OP had her at 16. But brother would only be 19 at the time. 19 is not a fully formed frontal lobe adult. It\u2019s a teenager that pays taxes. And the brother is living with mom at 28. Barring health conditions or legit helping mom out with daily tasks, legit saving cash for a house, brother needs to chill and recognize that he will get shit for living at home at 28. People might not take him seriously and it is what it is, it\u2019s a common dynamic. Him shitting on his little brother isn\u2019t going to have a huge impact.", "I think some of it is we're missing the tone of the whole conversation. When he asked about the homework did he say as a suggestion? Or was he trying to parent her?\n\nThe whole thing reads to me that the brother was trying to tell the daughter what to do, like in way that oversteps the OP as her dad. The way he says \"kids shouldn't have kids,\" kind of shoes he doesn't really respect op maybe doesn't think he's a good parent so he needs to step in and tell the daughter what to do. \n\nThat may be a bit of a reach, because there's not enough detail about his and his brother's relationship, but that's just how I read it.\n\nAnd while the daughter shouldn't have said what she said, she didn't really need to be punished for it. She just needs some help understanding that sometimes it's better to let things go and not respond.\n\nHer comment was sort of rude, but I don't know that I would classify it as bratty behavior like everyone else here. We're also missing the tone of how she said it too.", "First op is a man \n\nSecond, he said they're only visiting his mom's for a few weeks, I'm guessing as a vacation.

Op isn't living there they're just visiting.", "So this is exactly why I hate the term \"punishment\" because most people don't understand it. \n\nPunishment is for criminals. Punishment is for behavior and actions that are abhorrent and/or heinous. Disciplining is what children and a lot of adults need. \n\nChildren, ALL children, need disciplining. In forms of conversations addressing their behaviors and actions, imposed consequences to their actions and behaviors, and/or natural consequences. \n\nGrown people, also, should not be \"punished\" except for heinous actions and behaviors. \n\nAnd when parents actually parent their children properly, there's always a healthy amount of disciplining involved.", "No, punishment is punitive and doesn\u2019t do a good job of correcting behavior.

I also made a point to stress that this included family. Nobody got a pass.  My parents'  generation practically worshipped their elders which I suspect is why institutional child abuse was rampant.   A 9yo girl who isn't intimidated by an adult might be difficult to raise in a way that's socially acceptable, but she's a hell of a lot safer than a meek kid.  I have a 9yo granddaughter and she's a delightfully confident, precocious ND child and we've had to find ways to manage similar sorts of behaviour (in  direct consultation with her parents)  but there is no way we'd  ever want to stifle that impulse.  \nTo my everlasting shame I've allowed family members to discipline my kids in my presence. I hated it but I avoid conflict and didn't call them out.  My daughter, OTOH, is savagely defensive of her girls, has no issue with conflict, and will sure as shit tell you to get back in your lane if you cross the line.  Those girls know one thing with 100% certainty.  Their parents (and me, and my wife, and their uncle) will always have their back.", "he was the one that was rude though, its not his business and his motive was control of someone else's child.", "I partially agree. Uncle should not have answered for OP who was standing right there. The child\u2019s response was nasty and rude.", "I agree. The brother needs to mind his own business when it comes to the daughter. I WOULD have laughed, not almost laughed. It was a very cheeky thing for her to say and I may have talked to her later about it but, the brother needed to be put in his place.", "This is facts, I\u2019m noticing a lot of super irrational people here who clearly have no concept of emotional regulation or social maturity, the way the child responded is a reflection of ops parenting and I can assume a lot of these people saying nta would probably raise the most disrespectful burden to society animal children ever,", "Funny, I thought teachers were leaving/avoiding the field due to criminally low salary coupled with ridiculous over-working... \n\nSigned, the child of a former public school teacher & guidance counselor\n\nP.S. NTA, OP", "Folks simply aren't condoning the bro's actions and everyone else is focused on the child's. You'd let your brother order your child around when she's trying to talk to you? Real quick way to get your daughter to stop wanting to be around/talk to you.", "I don't think it's a big deal but I do think it was a bit rude to interrupt the interaction the parent was having with the kid to interject an opinion that really was none of his business.   In general though it definetly didn't deserve the rude come back and honestly if I were dad I would have just said \"we do homework at X time, don't worry, I got this\" and moved on.  Still it does seem a bit odd to be like \"stop, you can't play with your DAD until you do your homework\" when the real authority figure, the dad, is right there and should be making that decision.", "You gotta remember half Reddit hate their own families.", "Sounds like a pretty mild form of \u201cit takes a village\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t hate it. I wouldn\u2019t intervene myself if I had been the uncle, but some softer communication in response could have gone a long way to mitigating the damage.\n\nSomething like: \u201cI trust my daughter to be responsible with regards to getting her homework done.\u201d", "Kid being rude to uncle in a 'mean girl ' way learnt by TV - le epic\n\nUncle saying do your home work - you should literally consider hiring a hitman", "He wasn't rude.  He asked normal questions", "Maybe it\u2019s cultural, but I don\u2019t see how he was rude? What did he do that you have an issue with? It honestly just seems like you\u2019re confrontational.", "Why? The uncle was rude to the child. The child asked her dad a question, and uncle just jumped in. He did not let dad answer. That was rude. Why should a child be respectful to a rude adult?", "The brother shoulda stayed in a non parentals place", "\u201cadult bully\u201d LMFAO can everyone bffr\ud83d\ude2d its a normal thing for adults to ask if you finished your homework before running around and playing", "Yep. I have not once said she can't respond, I said it was how she responded", "> he probably thought because he's the older brother it's his place to do that. if i ever tried that i hope my niece or nephew would tell me off like that.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s cultural or depends on family dynamics, but I have corrected  my niece\u2019s & nephew\u2019s behaviors many times and their parents, much less them, would never think to be angry about it. We are a family and Im one of their caretakers (yes, even the ones I see once a year) so helping them become good people is not considered rude.\n\n> he got what he deserved for undermining his brother's authority over his child\n\nHe actually didn\u2019t undermine the dad because Op hadn\u2019t actually answered if his daughter could play or not, her uncle gave a suggestion before he could and OP got defensive (probably because he knows the brother was right and he\u2019s immature, but I don\u2019t know enough to know the real reason he got so defensive but it\u2019s clearly rubbing off on his child) \n\nId say NAH in this exact situation, but OP doesn\u2019t come off well imo", "I agree. It's one of those rare times that a kid happened to say to perfect thing and you secretly feel they are a hero for it. I would have been very annoyed with a sibling or even grandparents talking over me and undermining me when I'm trying to parent. \n\nI do hope though that OP talked to his daughter and let her know there are gentler ways to be firm with people who cross boundaries.", "Being seen and not heard is not the same thing as having good manners.\n\nChildren should have a voice and know how to speak up respectfully.", "Yes, often people talk about having self discipline as a positive thing (particularly when it\u2019s helped them to achieve a certain goal) but it\u2019s usually only used in as a punitive, punishing and generally negative measure when applied to others.", "Just came here to say this! Thank you!", "Nobody, apparently", "You hit it on the head!", "Christ, you'd let kids talk to you like that?", "An adult who is the parent? Yes. An adult who interferes with my parenting? Hell, no.
