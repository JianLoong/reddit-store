This is my 3rd pregnancy and I have 2 children. Unfortunately, this one didn\u2019t make it. I made my first OB appointment within the week of finding out and had a convo with my husband about keeping the pregnancy quiet until well after the first trimester as I wanted my mental peace. I have had an extremely rocky relationship with my in-laws and I just want my peace at this point. I want it quiet. No drama. I felt some cramping and had spotting which I\u2019ve never had before so this worried me. \n\n\nI called my OB and asked if it\u2019s normal. She said we can\u2019t really say what\u2019s normal. Every body is different. But if you see any bright red blood, go to the ER. This was Friday and on Saturday, I started passing blood clots. It scared me so my husband and I went to the hospital. We called everyone we could trust to watch the kids and who wouldn\u2019t ask us any questions to no avail. \n\nSo unfortunately we had to ask my FIL to watch the kids so I could go to the hospital. My FIL is nosy and can\u2019t keep his mouth shut about anything. He\u2019s also uneducated so we gave him minimal info that we knew he couldn\u2019t process. 6/7hours after being in the ER, it wasn\u2019t looking good but there was still hope. I had a subchorionic hematoma. Low fetal heartbeat. I started bleeding bright red after we went to go pick up our children from my FIL. He asked my husband what happened and he told him I had a uterine tear. We left and before we know it, he told my SIL and MIL. \n\n\nFor reference, my MIL and FIL are not married and haven\u2019t been for over 12 years. My FIL is also remarried now. They have all mistreated me in some way but all through backbiting and passive aggressive treatment. SIL called my husband and asked what happened to me and he told her even though I explicitly asked him not to. \n\nI\u2019m angry with my husband and I\u2019m still grieving. The sorrow comes and goes in waves. And when the waves come, they hit hard. MIL had two miscarriages so my husband feels like I should let her in because she knows how I feel. AITA for wanting nothing to do with her at all? And being extremely angry and feeling betrayed that he did this? I\u2019d like to try getting pregnant again but later this year and at this point, I feel like I shouldn\u2019t even tell him until I feel ready to tell his family which is after the second trimester or not at all? (I do understand that\u2019s not practical but that\u2019s how I feel)", "created_utc": 1704229318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18x08hk/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_tell_my_inlaws/", "score": 453, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At all. No calls, texts, Facebook messages, nada. And I really only allowed it because I was scheduled for a D&C because my body was holding on.\n\nHe followed my lead because it was *my body* going through the majority of the trauma. I already have anxiety, and he was not wanting to add to it. He took his role as interference seriously. \n\nHe even warned his mom that I would probably lose my shit if she called me, and she listened thank the gods.\n\nI still will say NAH. My husband didn\u2019t react outwardly, but he had to sit with me in the ER twice in 12 hours, once while knowing I was passing too many clots that were too big and no one was paying me any attention. Scared the nurses.\n\nThe conversation should have been had and y\u2019all would ideally come to an agreement. I.e. give me a week before telling them, or \u201cyou can tell your mom but I\u2019m not interested in her support because of our prior relationship\u201d.\n\nMy dad tried to help and say \u201cthese things happen, all these people had a miscarriage, blah blah blah.\u201d\u2026 but that didn\u2019t matter to me. I wanted support from very specific people who I could trust to respect my space, and I had to enforce that boundary. \n\nI think this was a miscommunication, and in the best light, he really wanted you to have support, and went to someone he knew had similar experiences. Only you know him enough to have an idea of his motives.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, I hope you get the peace you need.", "I mean Jesus Christ \n\nYou can\u2019t at least get home from the hospital without sounding the alarms and having to deal with other people\u2019s grief \n\nITS NOT THEIR TIME BACK THE F OFF", "OP, I urge you to take this up with grief counselors, family therapists, or someone who is trained in the careful, and delicate process of helping people through such a traumatic experience. AITA commentators will line up along clear lines based on their already-established political beliefs, and I'm not sure if that will help you.  You have legitimate feelings and are experiencing real grief. That you do not move through it in the same way your husband does does not eliminate the fact that he, too, is experiencing legitimate feelings and experiencing real grief, and trying to navigate them in his own way. \n\nMy deep condolences for your loss.", "NTA\n\nThis is YOUR private medical information and your husband has no business sharing it with anyone.", "Despite your rocky relationship, I say NAH.\n\nSo right off... you are not an asshole for wanting to keep this a secret.  Nor are you for  wanting to not talk about this with whoever you don't want to talk about this to.   Seems utterly reasonable\n\nSimply from a practicality standpoint,  however, I don't know how you could possible keep this a secret.  I mean, FIL is watching the kids so you can go to the ER.   There is no possible way to avoid the \"So what happened?  Are you ok??\".  You went to the ER.  If FIL \\_didn't\\_ ask you I'd put a big red flag over his head and would rethink him watching the kids, honestly.\n\nFrom there, FIL is going talk to others.\n\nMy unsolicited advice is to just say to folks a 2-3 sentence synopsis of what is going on but you aren't wanting to talk about it.  If they press, you appreciate their concern and their sympathy, and re-iterate your desire to not talk about it.  If they still press,  then I'd say a line has been crossed and you can firmly an unequivocally state taht this is private and that is it.    They can get offended all they want, but you were patient and civil and this is nobodies business but you and your husbands.  Anyone else that you choose to involve and talk about this with is you 2's business.\n\nI would also add that it is fair for your husband to point you at his mom.  It seems he's trying to help,   But he needs to understand that it ends there.  He offered due to a place of shared trauma, and as you said \"no thanks\", he cannot just force you to talk to his mom nor bring her over for an ersatz counseling sesh.\n\nThere is also the aspect that it is OK for Husband to talk to people he wants to talk about, insofar as \\_his\\_ feelings on the matter.  ( I assume he's not feeling great about this situation either and may need to unload)   But his feelings ONLY.   It needs to be made clear to him he cannot talk about  your thoughts nor recite your feelings on this to others.  He cannot position himself as a town cryer for your personal feelings.", "NAH. It seems like he too is just trying to process and grieve. Your feelings are 100% valid, but I don't think he did it to be an AH or to disrepect you.", "NTA-This was your medicinal information and your husband should have respected your feelings. I\u2019m sure he knows you have a difficult relationship with his family and including them in this made the situation harder on you.", "NAH - OP, not competing just saying so you know that I fully understand your loss - I have had 10 miscarriages. Some worse than others. Some I told everyone and some I told no one except my husband. \n\nYour feelings are valid and understandable. You don\u2019t trust your in laws to treat the knowledge with sensitivity, empathy or discretion and you need all of these things right now. \n\nYour husband may not want to fully share his grief with you because he sees how hard this is hitting you. His words to you might not match his feelings and needs. He is allowed to look for support as well, and if he thinks that looking to you for support would be asking too much from you,  can you understand why he might have told a family member?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is a right or wrong here. You don\u2019t have to share anything with your in laws or discuss what has happened with them. They don\u2019t need details. They don\u2019t need a single thing from you. \n\nHowever if you can discuss with your husband what he might need from them, and see if giving them an explanation without details so he can have support is acceptable and workable for you both I think this would be a good step. Discuss boundaries and make sure he is willing to hold those boundaries strong for you. \n\nI\u2019m so so sorry for your loss OP, be kind to yourself and find your support too \u2665\ufe0f", "Who cares if MIL had miscarriages, every grieves differently and plus who the hell would want someone you do t like to comfort you.\n\nNot sure why people feel the need to tell people about miscarriages.

I can't say I understand what you are going through because each grief experience is unique to the couple/ individual.  I am very sorry for your loss!\n\nThis baby was both of yours, so he has a right to share just as you do.  You will each grieve in your own way, so you have a right to say you don't want to talk to his mother.  He has a right to talk about it with her, though... and may have a need not to.  You need to discuss how you want to handle this as a couple, but you don't get to make a unilateral decision.  A mother's grief is usually marked by self-blame (studies say this is unique to western civilizations and an addition to the 7 stages of grief) and a father's is marked by a need to protect the wife/mother.  He feels helpless and may be seeking ways (perhaps via his mother who has had a similar experience) to ease your pain.  You are both grieving, so please try to understand each other's needs.\n\nI can't say YTA, NTA, etc. because grief isn't black and white.  Infant and pregnancy loss grief is a major stressor on a marriage.  You can choose to let this pull you together or tear you apart.  Please seek a support group or therapy to help you do the former.  \n\nThere are many groups that can help you... if you'd like to know about an infant/pregnancy loss FB support group I'm in, I'll pass that info along.  Again, I'm so sorry for your loss!  You are not alone!", "INFO - Is your husband aware to the extent you feel poorly about his side of the family, and what they've done to you? Were you low contact/no contact prior to this point? If so, was that just you, or was he part of a united front on that?", "NTA\n\nHe should respect your wishes.  He does not seem to understand the issue, but I am not sure of a good way to explain it.\n\nIt is very common to hold back information on pregnancy until you get to the point where it will start to show.", "I don't think anyone is the AH. You BOTH just lost a baby you loved the second you found out you were expecting. Your husband needs to have ppl he can confide in with how he feels while he is actively trying to support you and your body and likely the other two kids since after a loss you're not supposed to lift things etc. It's just a really hard case of the whole thing sucking. \nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. It's your private medical information. Only you get to choose when people get told and if they should be told at all.\n\nIf your Husband thinks it's ok to be disrespecting your feelings and wishes, then he is the one in the wrong as he should be putting you and your wellbeing first. Don't let him or anybody else make you feel otherwise.", "NAH in my own opinion, least of you. \n\nFirst of all, I am so sorry for your loss. That is heartbreaking. Im also sorry that your grief has been compounded by a betrayal of trust. \n\nI'm assuming that your husband means well, but he isn't acknowledging the truth of the situation. \n\nI haven't experienced this exact scenario but I have asked family members not to disclose certain things about me and they went ahead and did it anyway. The family member in question said in one instance of bad news- that I should give them the opportunity to support me in my tough times and in one instance of good news - that they would be pleased for me and would celebrate with me. In her mind, in a healthy and close family relationship, this is how somebody would react. However, I knew that I didn't have that kind of relationship with that person  and I knew how they would react- kick me when I was down (bad news) and get jealous and have a meltdown (good news).  Lo and behold, that is exactly how they behaved\n\nI think your husband is  either in denial that your relationship with your inlaws is as bad as it is or he is hoping to heal that relationship by having them bond with you in your time of grief. To be honest, that's just not how people work. Most of us dont switch from disdain to love in a heartbeat, trust needs to be earned. \n\nCan I suggest that you both attend counselling together prior to trying again for another baby? He needs to come to terms with the fact that his family treats you badly and they may never change. You both need to figure out boundaries with them, because they are never going to change unless he makes it clear there are repercussions for disrespecting his wife.\n\nIt may also be a good idea for you to decide how you are going to proceed, if he is not willing to address his family's bad behaviour.", "NTA.  You may need some support that isn't your husband.  Miscarriage is hard to cope with. I am saying this from personal experience.  Because it really hasn't been discussed enough, and women are strongly encouraged to keep it secret, many people have no clue as to how to deal with it.  How is your husband with expressing his feelings about other things?  He may be hurting but just sucks at expressing it and doesn't know what to do (I did see the comment as to what he said).  I don't know your husband, but some people mean well but say all the wrong things.  \n\nI am not going to say what is right or wrong for you.  I will say that if my miscarriage is brought up, my husband is usually the one crying about our lost child.  It was 14 years ago, and he still has some grief.  If your husband is hurting, he may need someone for support right now.  Right now, you need to take care of you, and you probably can't be that person for him.  (FYI - the hormones are all wacky for a while afterwards, which is very unhelpful.)  Where can he go that you will OK with?  If no one you know is OK, then a professional counselor who legally has to keep all your information private can be the way to go.  You have a right to privacy, but that doesn't negate the possibility that your husband is grieving the loss of a child.  Where can he go?  \n\nSo, while I think you are justified in wanting to have your privacy, this isn't only your loss.  Since he already told, maybe ask him to tell the ILs to not bring up the topic with you as you need privacty right now.  You said they aren't great, but they might possibly do as asked.", "Info:  Was your husband supposed to know that he wasn\u2019t supposed to tell his dad?

My partner knew without even having to be asked to not share this information with anyone (family or friends) because ultimately this is my body and I\u2019m the one taking the huge physical toll and the bulk of the mental toll as well. We had each other to lean on and that was enough. That was months ago and still now I couldn\u2019t ever see myself telling family about it. There are some things you just don\u2019t want to discuss with others and he should\u2019ve respected that. He needs to learn this going forward. \nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and wish you the best!", "First, let me give you my condolences. \n\nI suffered several miscarriages between my first and second child. I got pregnant so easily the first time. It\u2019s hard to explain the pain of numerous losses. \n\nEveryone mourns differently. Some folks want all their family and friends gathered around them. They post their loss on social media. I was a very private mourner. I just didn\u2019t want to deal with questions and commiserations and dealing with everyone else\u2019s feelings. My feelings were hard enough to manage. \n\nI am not close with my in-laws. I do know my MIL had at least one miscarriage. That doesn\u2019t mean I ever wanted to discuss my loss with her. \n\nI\u2019ve suffered miscarriages. That doesn\u2019t mean I fully understand how OP feels. \n\nThe idea that OP somehow \u201cowes\u201d this to people who have treated her badly feels gross. OP explicitly told her husband not to tell. \n\nNo one knows exactly how another feels. I don\u2019t know exactly how OP feels but o do know that if I clearly told my husband to not share this - and he did anyway? I would be angry. This is a time when a woman you feel so vulnerable. The physical, mental, emotional impact is hard to describe. But now the husband has given information to people who have historically treated OP badly- when she is at her most vulnerable. She was clear to her husband but rather than discuss it with her - he felt he knew better and decided OP should now bond with people who she doesn\u2019t like or trust? Really? So the one person who should have her back, doesn\u2019t?\n\nIf it were me? Yes, I\u2019d be angry. \n\nAnd yes, the men mourn as well but why does his mourning take precedence over hers?? And everyone on here is going on about how he needed to process the loss with his family- I don\u2019t get that from the information given. I don\u2019t read that the husband has discussed this as a process of mourning. It reads like he just told the FIL and from there it spread like wildfire. The husband even said it was for OP to discuss with the MIL - not him.", "NTA. This is your private information which you don\u2019t need to share with your in-laws.

This is my 3rd pregnancy and I have 2 children. Unfortunately, this one didn\u2019t make it. I made my first OB appointment within the week of finding out and had a convo with my husband about keeping the pregnancy quiet until well after the first trimester as I wanted my mental peace. I have had an extremely rocky relationship with my in-laws and I just want my peace at this point. I want it quiet. No drama. I felt some cramping and had spotting which I\u2019ve never had before so this worried me. I called my OB and asked if it\u2019s normal. She said we can\u2019t really say what\u2019s normal. Every body is different. But if you see any bright red blood, go to the ER. This was Friday and on Saturday, I started passing blood clots. It scared me so my husband and I went to the hospital. We called everyone we could trust to watch the kids and who wouldn\u2019t ask us any questions to no avail. So unfortunately we had to ask my FIL to watch the kids so I could go to the hospital. My FIL is nosy and can\u2019t keep his mouth shut about anything. He\u2019s also uneducated so we gave him minimal info that we knew he couldn\u2019t process. 6/7hours after being in the ER, it wasn\u2019t looking good but there was still hope. I had a subchorionic hematoma. Low fetal heartbeat. I started bleeding bright red after we went to go pick up our children from my FIL. He asked my husband what happened and he told him I had a uterine tear. We left and before we know it, he told my SIL and MIL. For reference, my MIL and FIL are not married and haven\u2019t been for over 12 years. My FIL is also remarried now. They have all mistreated me in some way but all through backbiting and passive aggressive treatment. SIL called my husband and asked what happened to me and he told her even though I explicitly asked him not to. I\u2019m angry with my husband and I\u2019m still grieving. The sorrow comes and goes in waves. And when the waves come, they hit hard. MIL had two miscarriages so my husband feels like I should let her in because she knows how I feel. AITA for wanting nothing to do with her at all? And being extremely angry and feeling betrayed that he did this? I\u2019d like to try getting pregnant again but later this year and at this point, I feel like I shouldn\u2019t even tell him until I feel ready to tell his family which is after the second trimester or not at all? (I do understand that\u2019s not practical but that\u2019s how I feel)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

NAH. \n\nIf your husband needs support about losing the idea of a baby perhaps he can speak to a professional; including family that unsupportive of you or even hostile is not it. This isn\u2019t about your MIL and her experiences, and you don\u2019t need to relate to her in your grief.", "First of all, I  very sorry you lost your baby.  I had one miscarriage early on and it was devastating.  My husband was sad at first but then seemed to move on.   It wasn\u2019t until a couple of years later when our son died at 21 months that he seemed to think about the first pregnancy.  \n\nYour husband maybe dealing with it in his own way.  While you did ask him not to share, he may not have been thinking.   \nIt does sound like you too need to talk about this and how you feel about his family and how they treat you.", "NTA\nIt's never wrong to ask your partner to keep your medical issues private. And really just to wait a bit until you were ready to tell. He could get his support from someone outside his family. To console himself at your expense was cruel.", "NTA\nIt's an extremely delicate matter and he should have respected what you asked him to do. On the other hand, it's a loss for him too, he's also grieving and just consider that he wanted to share it with his family and he probably thought that since your mil went through the same thing that could help you in some way. Your feelings are 100% justified though.", "I had two losses before welcoming my first in 2022 and we didn\u2019t tell my in laws about either of them because they make everything about them and I didn\u2019t want that. My MIL also had miscarriages and I didn\u2019t want to talk to her about it because without a doubt it would be about her experience. I understand the grief and wanting to handle it yourself. \n\nThe only thing I could argue is that maybe your husband was looking for some comfort from his family. My husband struggled talking to me about his grief because I was so overwhelmed with my own. It doesn\u2019t mean that he should have said anything but maybe there\u2019s more to it than just blabbing. \n\nI hope you\u2019re doing ok \u2665\ufe0f", "It was also his baby and he can tell his family if he feels he needs to. I\u2019m not sure what the education level of his father has anything to do with anything. Yta", "No judgement, cos it's a hard place to be. My brother was told not to let his family know about the miscarriage he and his partner had. Thing is, we're part of his support network. He lost a child too. He needed support and couldn't get it because his partner needed him to be her support and he wasn't allowed to reach out for help.\n\nMaybe your husband doesn't get support from his family - that's why I'm going with no judgement. But if taking to them about hard stuff helps him process it, you need to find ways to set boundaries in your interactions with the in laws while giving him the option to reach out to them.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I can\u2019t imagine how challenging it was to not be able to control who knew about your loss and pain. And to not even be able to feel that you could trust your partner with this information anymore. I imagine that neither of you had explicitly planned for this experience, so you both reacted on instinct. But now you at least have the opportunity to hash things out for the future. Ideally you both could go over what each of you NEEDS, wants, and would prefer in future stressful situations. This can help understand behavior and also provide clarity. Maybe your husband didn\u2019t understand that your privacy was a genuine need and as a result didn\u2019t balance it appropriately against other factors. And maybe you will learn that his needs look very different than what you would expect. You may both even realize than you haven\u2019t been engaging in behavior that meets your own needs at times. Overall, it seems obvious to me that your husband dropped the ball here, but I\u2019d encourage you to find out his perspective. The intentions to understand and be understood are so important in any relationship. Sorry this was so long, but I hope it helps in some way.", "NTA, he gave your personal medical information even when you asked him not to. What is wrong with him?", "NTA - you have every right to feel horribly betrayed by your husband.  Your body, your boundaries, your medical privacy - and he betrayed that, when you were feeling your most low and vulnerable - he shared that information with people who have mistreated you.\n\nYou need to share with him how you are feeling.  I know people are saying he's allowed to grieve his child - yes - but his first role is to PROTECT his wife when she's vulnerable and asking him to protect her PRIVACY.\n\nAnd he failed astronomically at that small task.", ">you need to talk to your husband about how you feel like you can\u2019t tell him if you get pregnant again\n\nThis is some good insight.

I\u2019m seeing that very clearly.", "He didn't go about it right but he did lose a baby too. Whether he talks about it isn't just up to her", "Finally!

I appreciate your logic from both sides.", "This is a great response!", "He told me that he feels like it\u2019s a lost opportunity but that I\u2019m more important. I don\u2019t quite understand it.

We dump outwards rather than burdening those further in. Husband is having a hard time, OP is having a worse one. She is going through all the same horror he is, but with the added assault of pregnancy hormones and the proximity of it being within her own body. If the husband is making things worse, he needs to stop. His coping with the situation is only the second-most-important thing here.", "Especially as he\u2019s grieving over a lost child as well.  \n\nFor many men, their father is their best friend, and as his mother lost 2 pregnancies his father will know how he feels and they can talk to one another about how he\u2019s feeling right now.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your losses as well. Thank you for responding. I do understand where you\u2019re coming from and through your reply I also understand my husband needed comfort in this situation as well. I\u2019m so sorry you suffered.", "You\u2019re totally right but I think in this case whilst saying it was for op he really was trying to get support for himself. As it was op physically going through it maybe he wanted to speak to someone else without worrying he is putting extra on her.", "Miscarriages happen to the father too", ">Not sure why people feel the need to tell people about miscarriages.\n\nI think because women often feel like they somehow failed.  Women want to shine a light to let other women know they're not alone, this is sadly more common than they think, and it's not their fault if they weren't indulging in risky behavior.", "I\u2019ll take the support group. Please. Thank you for your words. I appreciate the understanding of both sides.", "He\u2019s fully aware of the extent of how they\u2019ve treated me but this has always been a soft subject for him because they are his family. So for 2 years my MIL has been no contact for both of us because blamed my husband for something she did to herself and then she finally felt like it was enough so she started speaking to him slowly over the last 3-5 months. As for my FIL, my husband talks to him almost everyday but my husband, his words not mine, \u201ccan\u2019t talk to him about everything and he doesn\u2019t listen to me\u201d. My husband can say something and my FIL will disregard it to talk about himself. I have 3 sisters in law. One who rarely picks up the phone when my husband answers but does speak with my husband. While the other two don\u2019t speak to him at all. So my FIL, like I said he wouldn\u2019t know what anything meant until he spoke to someone who did. So we gave him very minimal info. He told everyone but only the ones who would call my husband did. SIL asked what happened to me specifically and my husband told her. After I had already asked him not to. Even if my FIL did say something. It would have had to be confirmed by my husband which is what I asked my husband not to do.

I do know the friend was deeply and more hurt about the miscarriage than the wife was. She told me that herself. \n\nI\u2019ve already scheduled my therapy session because I can\u2019t continue keeping this within anymore.

It\u2019s important to note that my FIL and MIL aren\u2019t married and my FIL lives alone. After FIL told everyone, SIL called him and asked what he was talking about and then my husband told her specifics. I felt my husband didn\u2019t have to confirm anything based on the fact that we had already agreed that we wouldn\u2019t say anything. Or more specifically wouldn\u2019t tell his family. I was understanding in the moment and still am but I also expressed to my husband that I\u2019m upset/angry about it.", "Thank you. This essentially verbalizes how I feel and I\u2019m sorry you suffered too. I\u2019ve been told that the pain never truly goes away. And that sucks. I wish it weren\u2019t true. I honestly wish I could just forget everything. I wish I didn\u2019t know. I wish I just thought it was a heavy period. The miscarriage was very traumatic for me and I felt the fetus come out of my uterus. I have two other children that I need to take care of and the grief just comes in times where I feel unavailable. And unable to really do anything. I prefer to grief in silence or by myself. That\u2019s just how I am. I appreciate your understanding for my own view while not \u201cdragging\u201d my husband. I wasn\u2019t even going to tell him when it happened. I felt it in my bones that I was losing the baby and I made it up in my head that I wouldn\u2019t tell him when it happened so he\u2019d have nothing to tell his family if something did happen. When I felt it, I went to the bathroom to confirm and just lost it. I was screaming and inconsolable and kind of blacked out. He was leaving for work so my kids told him I was crying and he came in and was doing his best to console me. He was there for me! But I still have my feelings about the situation.", "Could he not have respected her wishes *and* sought support for his grief? For example, by talking to friends instead of one of the few people she didn't want knowing about it?!", "My husband told me he viewed it as a lost opportunity. That doesn\u2019t sound like grief to me.", "The loss, fine, but he was giving out very detailed information about her body. A uterine tear? The FIL does not need to know (and will not understand) that level of detail, and I can absolutely understand how that level of detail would also feel violating to someone in a vulnerable moment.", "It was only my FIL who watched the kids. He could have kept it to himself which is what my husband also wanted. It was my FIL who told the EVERYONE else. And I don\u2019t see how I put him in a hard place when my husband and I previous discussed how I didn\u2019t want anyone to know and he agreed.", "I do understand where you\u2019re coming from though.

I would have liked to have kept it private but even my husband knew that once he told his dad, everyone would know because my FIL literally called everyone and told them EVERYTHING. That\u2019s just what he does with any information you tell him. So that\u2019s another reason why I wanted it quiet. There\u2019s no maturity there. I told my husband that FIL had no right to tell anyone what was going on with my body. It wasn\u2019t his place. He agreed but then said you know he\u2019s not mature enough.

He can absolutely talk to his family without her being involved - he can make it clear that he's wanting their support, not her, and not to approach her at all.\n\nAnd that seems to be the crux of the matter - she doesn't want them being nosy and pushing their \"help\" on her.

Invalidating and downplaying his feelings in general is likely to build a fortress between you because men already feel like they can't express their feelings...  That's why there are so many angry, explosive men in the world...  They try to put their pain on the back burner but never get to deal with it because when is it ever a good time to deal with it?  Eventually the whole house burns down and the women who invalidate them sit there wondering why...   In a healthy marriage, both partners validate each other...   They never say that my suffering is worse than yours...  They are 1 single unit now & everything that occurs in their joined life affects both of them, albeit in different ways...  \n\nMy husband and I have had many miscarriages & have experienced the extreme grief of losing my 2nd brother, suddenly, who also happened to be my husband's best friend of over 20 years...   We both have grieved very differently, but we absolutely never invalidate each other's grief...  We didn't know how to survive losing my brother and how to process our different grief together so I put myself in grief counseling asap and shared with him the tools that I learned...   Due to my traumatic past, my strongest instinct was to push him away to avoid the potential for more pain...  His instinct was to seek closeness and connection...   I could see that I was pushing him away and knew deep down that's not what I really wanted, so I did what I had to do to deal in a healthy way...   I'm going to strongly encourage you to do the same...", "My FIL told my MIL to \u201cflush it down the toilet\u201d when she had hers. He was very insensitive and wasn\u2019t there when she had her miscarriages.", "Why could he not have sought support from his friends? He went to one of the very few people she asked him not to...", "I sent you an invitation to chat with the info.", "I also don\u2019t really speak to my in-laws. If I call, they don\u2019t answer. It\u2019s just cordial from my part at this time. I don\u2019t want any drama. I just want a quiet life. I think my husband is trying to do his best. We are a united front but again his family is a very touchy subject for him. We also moved away from them twice to get away from the drama.", "I wasn\u2019t automatically upset but as time goes by and - my emotions go up and down - and things are said by my MIL make me upset because of the unfavorable relationship I have with my ILs.", "Based on this you\u2019re NTA.  You had a previous discussion and both agreed.  He went against that.", "Did he mean it was a lost opportunity to raise this particular child? Or a lost opportunity for you to bond with MIL and SIL. His phrasing absolutely sucks, but when you are ready, give him a chance to elaborate what he meant. \n\nSome people (particularly men) are socially conditioned not to express emotions that make them vulnerable and downplay them. \n\nI cant blame you for being angry, but I wouldnt jump the gun and assume that he isnt experiencing some level of grief.", "A lost opportunity is any opportunity that is lost. In your case another child, in my case my mom died, in someone else's case it's a job they didn't get. I wish my kids would have been able to spend more time with their grandma before she died, it's a lost opportunity. Grief is literally losing the opportunity to experience that thing/event/feeling/person and trying to navigate life after with all of the emotions. Your husband lost a child, he can talk to whomever he wants. Is he just supposed to sit with his emotions and thoughts to himself? Everyone needs to have someone away from their spouse to talk. Having lost 2 pregnancies before I know it's an emotional rollercoaster but I'm so glad that my SO had someone to talk to besides me about it.", "Respectfully, it\u2019s not up to you to decide what grief should look like.", "He definitely will be grieving as well, even if it doesn't look like how you expect or want it to. \n\nHOWEVER, him grieving doesn't give him license to go against your wishes. Him speaking to friends about it would have been much more appropriate.", "Lost opportunity is grief.  That\u2019s just how he expressed it.  \n\nSounds like you just don\u2019t think men are capable of grieving so I\u2019ll change my N A H to YTA", "Calling a miscarriage kinda seems like an AH move. nta", "why are you actively going to try to get pregnant with him after this??", "[deleted]", "That really sucks.\nI'm very sorry for how you feel, and for your loss.\n\n\nAnd as much as I am angry for you- (and you have the complete right to feel the way you do about it) I think it's really strong of you to try and see both sides of it. \n\n\nYou shouldn't have to always be the mature one, but life just isn't fair a lot of the time.\n\n\nI think its really important, that after you've had some time to process what you're currently feeling, that you let your partner know exactly how you feel about it. Not by yelling or blaming, just a calm conversation. Hopefully he can understand how hurt you were by his decision (and it was HIS DECISION) to not choose to respect your decision on how you are processing YOUR grief.\n\n\nA lot of people saying he is grieving as well, and they are completely right. But the way he is trying to process his grief by disrespecting your right to yours, especially so soon after the fact is not alright. \n\n\nI think you're both going through a lot. I don't think he meant it maliciously or meanly- I think he just screwed up. I think it's important he understands that, so you can both reach a point were you can grieve together, and regain your trust in him. \n\n\nEvery thing is better after a good sleep, I recommend waiting after that so you can verbalise how you feel clearly. I was told once as a kid to use the format \"I feel.....\", \"because.....\", \"I want...\" to try and convey  clearly how you feel and what you need from the people close to you. Well into adult hood this format really helps to take a breath and clearly communicate. \n\n\nOnce again, I am so sorry for what you are going through. I think it's fair to feel how you're feeling, but as a random stranger who cannot know everything about your situation just from reddit- trust your gut, and trust that communicating clearly with your husband will help him understand your feelings, and you his, so this doesn't become a ball of resentment in your marriage. You are going through something incredibly hard. Give yourself time to take that breather. I'm wishing you the best.", "I definitely did not think that. But seriously, you cannot (with a straight face) say everything you did and in the manner you did, and then have the audacity to complain about others being passive aggressive. Yikes. Just yikes.", "Imagine dropping off your kids at your parents house and not telling them why you're taking your spouse to the hospital.\n\nNow that could get them making calls and searching out what's wrong, and cause them extreme worry and fear and that's just not a caring move to not lend some understanding to help them be calmed that a person is taking their spouse to the hospital.\n\nHe is talking to his own father here.  He's telling his own father why he has to take his wife to the hospital.  \n\nI totally understand.", "It depends on the relationship with his friends, many men can't rely on friends to talk to this sort of stuff about. Until fairly recently I didn't have any of those friends so it would have been family or nobody. Its shit but often true. \n\nI agree she should have some say and think he should have mentioned it first and together they could discuss how best to go about it, including the who, that's why I said he didn't go about it well.", "He gets to talk about the loss of having a baby and rely on people for support. He can talk about how he feels about it. That isn't just up to her.", "It\u2019s his loss too. He has a right to talk about it. It doesn\u2019t just affect her.", "If he is going to go behind her back like this, they shouldn't be having more kids. Why would you procreate with someone that can't be trusted?", "It\u2019s also probably why to talked to his father, as his father will know how he\u2019s feeling.  OP\u2019s not the only one who lost a child, her husband did as well.  My wife\u2019s miscarriages were hard on both of us.", "Nah, he was told to keep his mouth shut and he didn't. He gets gets no points for ignoring her request.", "The miscarriage was a Lost opportunity. He said that\u2019s the best way he could describe it. If the pregnancy was successful I wanted to wait until after the 2nd trimester too because I didn\u2019t want any drama either. We also spoke to each other about this and he agreed.", "Surely he could have processed this with a friend or someone else, instead of going to one of the very few people his wife asked him to not tell...\n\nETA: it shows he cares about the loss, but also shows he doesn't care about his wife", "It is not his medical information to share.", "And when he miscarries he can run his mouth all he wants until then he stfu.", "He doesn't have the right to share someone else's private medical information though.", "Omg", "Damn \ud83e\udd7a", "I'm not OP's husband, but I don't think it's fair to assume that he has a huge support network other than his family. I certainly don't.", "That was really kind of you. I'm glad you made the offer to OP and followed up!", "He meant the unborn child was a lost opportunity. He said that was the best way for him to explain it to me. \n\nThat is true. In society men aren\u2019t allowed to show feelings. So it\u2019s possible he didn\u2019t/doesn\u2019t really know how to articulate it in a way I would understand. \n\nUnfortunately, in this moment. I feel like I needed him to show more emotion but it might be better for it to be as it was so I would feel like I had someone to rely on.

I\u2019ve been talking to him whenever the feelings come and in a calm manner so he knows how I feel and there is no arguing. Internally I\u2019m just angry and feel betrayed and it comes and goes. I can be okay one minute and then the next feel outraged or feel a sense of doom. Thanks again for speaking in a manner that\u2019s not insensitive. It is a very emotional subject.", "I said what I said according to my own view. You don\u2019t know these people so you can\u2019t make an accurate judgement on my own words that even my husband has used. Plenty of people have terrible relationships with their in laws. Mine is no different. I can have my quiet opinion and still not be passive aggressive. Idk what\u2019s wrong with you with judging me over this.", "> Until fairly recently I didn't have any of those friends so it would have been family or nobody. Its shit but often true.\n\nThen you hire a therapist and talk to that person. \n\nYou do NOT tell your family about your SO's private medical tragedy without your SO's consent. Ever. So if your family is the only emotional support you have in your life and your SO isn't willing to share that information with them, *you don't get to tell them* because that's betraying a huge confidence. You need to outsource that emotional support instead - because the need for support is valid, but it doesn't supersede your SO's privacy.", "Op commented that one of the fil's comments about miscarriages was \"just flush it down the toilet\" it's unclear to me whether this was said in regards to ops miscarriage or was said when mil had a miscarriage. Either way though doesn't sound like the kinda of guy to be helpful in this situation.\n\nWhen it comes to medical shit the person directly experiencing the medical shit gets the say on who the info gets out to, especially within the first few weeks of shit going down. If op had cancer but said \"I really don't want drama right now so please don't tell your family about it\" that's her right and it should be respected. Even though in that instance the husband would be just as effected as he is now he still needs to respect that his body isn't the one that was growing something only for it to die while inside you. No one is saying he can't talk about it.

If you're telling someone else's business to someone they don't want to know, it's not going to be okay no matter how you swing it.

He just dropped private info on them, disrespecting that his wife is going through a really hard time and doesn't want to deal with the pushy or negative energy they can bring.
