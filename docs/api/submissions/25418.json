You said you don't have kids and never will. This may be a delicate question and obviously you don't need to share, but you should probably consider it: is this by choice? Mutual choice? Because perhaps part of his drive in this is from a wish to be a parent. Now, maybe it's from something else entirely instead--a desire to present the image that he's doing better financially than he is, especially to the brother that makes 5x as much as he does. Or maybe he genuinely feels that this is the best way to spend his money, idk. But I don't think you're an AH because you bring up great points--what kind of retirement *are* you guys looking at at this pace? Is there some \"love language\" mistranslation happening?

You stated that you don't know if he has savings, which is another clue that your husband may not see you as financially responsible. If a person views their partner as materialistic or not a responsible spender, they wouldn't want to disclose their financial information due to fearing the person's probability of confusing savings with backup money to do things such as go on vacations or buy expensive items.

OP is b!tching that she's not being taken care of. She's all about herself and what she's lacking from the relationship. In the case of yourself, you've evidently put your marriage ahead of yourself. Yet you're defending her. Are her bills paid? Is she able to eat? Yes. Yet all she can say is \"I want more.\" Her husband isn't out cheating, clubbing, gambling or anything like that. He's investing in people he believes in. She'd be complaining just as much if he was putting $200 a month into a car he was restoring. She's just pissed that his resources aren't going to her alone. As a wounded vet myself I can say it takes a special person to stand beside a vet. I praise my wife every day for helping me. And I praise you for helping your husband. OPs husband is helping his family in the best way he knows how. Instead of helping anyone else, OP is just focusing on herself.", "He\u2019s always been this way, so you knew that. I\u2019m so sorry for you.", "i still paid for vacations when i made less money. so basically it's either i pay or i don't go, no matter how much money he makes.", "I sincerely appreciate your answers. I am  not trying to be flip or make myself out to be a  martyr. But being concerned about their financial future is not being a princess. Should she stop buying frivolous stuff? Sure. But his wife should come over nieces and nephews. My husband and I are financially well off. It is a miracle that we both lived and were blessed enough to have money. It helped keep us from being insolvent. We buy our nieces and nephews and even friends kids nice stuff but because their parents have money, we don\u2019t take up funding their college education. OP may not be a great wife but that doesn\u2019t matter if you see marriage as a covenant. Maybe u don\u2019t and that\u2019s okay. You put the spouse first, though. Period. Honestly it sounds like they have bigger problems than just that money going out for cash gifts. Again, I do appreciate your taking the time to answer me.", "what makes you think him saving the money he spends on his niblings means that he's going to change who he is? He showed you who he is. Believe him.", "I agree they have far deeper issues than just the money. I call her out because she openly admits to blowing money on frivolous things, but she expects his money to be spent on her. They both should be saving money for future hardships. But it's incredibly hypothetical to demand your spouse make sacrifices when you refuse to do so yourself."]}
