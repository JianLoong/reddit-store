You said you don't have kids and never will. This may be a delicate question and obviously you don't need to share, but you should probably consider it: is this by choice? Mutual choice? Because perhaps part of his drive in this is from a wish to be a parent. Now, maybe it's from something else entirely instead--a desire to present the image that he's doing better financially than he is, especially to the brother that makes 5x as much as he does. Or maybe he genuinely feels that this is the best way to spend his money, idk. But I don't think you're an AH because you bring up great points--what kind of retirement *are* you guys looking at at this pace? Is there some \"love language\" mistranslation happening?

You stated that you don't know if he has savings, which is another clue that your husband may not see you as financially responsible. If a person views their partner as materialistic or not a responsible spender, they wouldn't want to disclose their financial information due to fearing the person's probability of confusing savings with backup money to do things such as go on vacations or buy expensive items.
