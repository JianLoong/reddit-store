Does your boyfriend understand that \"being invested in other people\" is basically what friendship is?

Your bf is not. I would probably not go because we don\u2019t know how the bride feels (unless you\u2019ve met her and know she is also fine with the friendship).", "NTA. In addition, you just started dating this guy based on your addional comments, and red flags are going off on his controlling behavior. Rethink that relationship.", "Info... is your bf always so jealous? \n\nYour ex is marrying someone else, I'd think your BF would be happy about this....", "NTA. Your dude needs to chill, especially him wanting you to block the guy. Like, grow up, man - guy's marrying someone else, it's okay. That said, I didn't go to my ex's wedding, but that's because I hate him, so... I think you're good here.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is possessive and controlling. Rethink your relationship", "NTA.\n\nThe fact that you're excited to see your ex marry someone other than you should be all the reassurance your boyfriend needs. He likely feels insecure, but he needs to work through that, as remaining friends with an ex is reasonable and not something he should prevent.", "NTA. Tell your boyfriend that being invested in other people's relationships is called having friends.", "NTA- also you might wanna include in your post that the relationship wasn\u2019t very long. I believe in a comment you said less than two weeks right? That\u2019s kinda important \n\n\nAlso info: does new bf know how long you dated ex?", "ESH.  If a romantic relationship doesn't work out, it's best to make a clean break.  Many women like to pull the \"let's be friends\" bit to rotate a nice guy to the back burner.  Many guys are stupid enough to fall for that crap.  \n\nAs a guy, you don't get involved with a girl who is just friends with a former lover.  That is because she is entering a new relationship with a pre-established exit plan.  At best, she will give you and your relationship 50% effort, as she's already planning to fail.\n\nNow obviously Michael is upset.  But I don't think it is the wedding itself that upsets him so much.  I suspect he's upset as he just learned his GF has a former lover on the back burner.  And now he's wondering how many other nasty surprises will she hit him with later?\n\nAs for why Michael is AH also, \n\nWell, let's put it in terms of how Michael should handle the situation.  If he handles this correctly, he should not be upset AT ALL that his girlfriend is going to the wedding of her former lover.  But then, he should not be emotionally invested in a girl who is still emotionally invested with a former lover, either.\n\nIn short, it's not AH behavior for you to attend the wedding.  It's AH behavior to keep guys on the back burner while you are dating other guys.   (so it was an AH move to be in a position to get an invitation to the wedding)  And it's also AH behavior for a guy to tolerate that behavior in his GF, for even a millisecond.  That's why I say ESH.", "YWNBTA, but for those saying the BF is controlling and toxic, if this was showed in his POV (he probably doesn't know OP and Allen's history in-depth, only knows of him as OP's ex) you would switch up pretty quickly. \n\nAs you said, he is just a friend, but see if you can let your BF tag along with you to the wedding for him to see what your relationship with Allen is like for himself.", "NTA - The people in our past help form who we are today.  Yes, sometimes there is no space to be friends with past partners, other times, there are.  Seems like you parted ways and stayed friends sometimes those are the best because you are happy you did the adulting and realized a romantic relationship wasn't in the cards and made healthy decisions to part ways.  Tell BF if anything, he should take the fact you want to go to the wedding as a positive - why would you want to go if you still had romantic feelings for they guy?  Those are his insecurities - figure out if they are red flags or not.", "NTA. Friendship is a form of relationship. Your boyfriend should stop being jelly and grow up sooner than later.", "NTA. It's great to go to friend's weddings. See if your BF can go as your us one. \n\nAlso significant others trying to isolate their partners from friends and family is a red flag. I hope this is an isolated incident, if not, you need to reevaluate the relationship.", "NTA and your current boyfriend is controlling and toxic. He probably can't fathom remaining in good terms with an ex because all his exes HATE him, for a number of very good reasons I'd say", "Personally I think your bf is being ridiculous. If you're being invited to a wedding obviously there is no romantic prospects there. \n\nHowever my answer kind of depends on what question you want answered. The one in your title or in your post. No you are N T A for thinking of going to a friend's wedding even if that friend was someone you dated. YWBTA for going despite you bf telling you he feels uncomfortable with it.\n\nIn my shoes I would think my husband would be over reacting if he was upset about me going to a wedding of an ex boyfriend but I care more about my husband and his boundaries then some friend who I rarely talk to.\n\nIf you want to send some sort of well wishes, you could send them a card and possibly a gift off the registry.\n\nEdit I'm assuming your bf isn't a toxic person like so many here have. It could be that he's a normal person but this is a boundary for him. You know your bf. Is he controlling in other ways? Does he get jealous easier?

Personally I think this comes down to insecurity. I was just a bridesmaid at my ex\u2019s wedding and he was played a big role at my wedding too.

It sounds like it\u2019s just the 2 of you doing an activity that most adults would view as a date. If you\u2019ve been friends for years, is Michael (and for that matter Lilly) aware of this? Because if you\u2019re both just friends, this shouldn\u2019t be anything that you should hide from your partner. Has Michael ever hung out with you and Allen? If the answer to both is yes, did Michael voice any disdain towards Allen? Because if he did of course he wouldn\u2019t want you going to the wedding and you should have anticipated his response. I really can\u2019t call him controlling because I do not know the semantics of your relationship but it sounds like the 2 of you have different values regarding keeping in touch with ex\u2019s and opposite sex relationships. The crux of the issues is that both you and Michael need to establish and agree on boundaries with the opposite sex otherwise it might not last. This is something that you need to establish early on in a relationship.", "If you want to go, and the couple is OK with you going, go. NTA imo", "NTA. Your BF sounds a little insecure.

We'd been friends for YEARS and it just didn't work out romantically.", "I am concerned ALREADY. Asking OP doesn't go to the wedding is one thing, but demanding she CUTS ALL CONTACT? Red flag, big one.", "No, which is why I was kind of shocked because ordinarily he's not like this at all. I don't know if it's a jealousy thing either as much as maybe insecurity?

There are, however, plenty of reasons why one would pretend to be a good person. Don't be fooled.", "Can he go as your plus one?", "There's nothing disrespectful about talking about exes.\n\nIf you were to talk about your exes (or one specific ex) all the time, it could signal that you haven't moved on. But simply acknowledging a relationship that was a thing, or the fact that you remain friends with an ex? There's nothing wrong with that. An insecure or immature person will care about you bringing up your exes from time to time. A mature person who is secure will recognize that what you have with them is good and that there's a reason the exes are exes.", "Michael not only doesn't want OP to not go to the wedding, he wants her to cut all contact with Allen. What's the best case scenario? Maybe if Michael was cheated on in the past it would be understandable, but if that's not the case...", "Isolating the victims from friends and family is what toxic people do.

That's a big red flag right there.", "Here you have a third unbiased opinion (and more coming): if you and your ex are friends, and he (and his soon to be wife) didn't have any problems inviting you, then there is no reason in the world why you shouldn't go. Your current boyfriend being jealous and controlling is not a reason. Go to the wedding, have fun, be happy for your friend, maybe have a speech.", "You're not the AH. Your boyfriend is jealous of your ex, even though your ex is GETTING MARRIED TO ANOTHER WOMAN. Your boyfriend clearly suspects that you and your ex are going to fuck, thus his desire for you to BLOCK HIM.\n\nThat's insane. That's insane behavior on the part of your BF. If he's this jealous-behaving now, imagine what it'll be like once you're engaged, once you're married, once you \"belong to him\".\n\nAgain, I want to stress that your boyfriend is jealous of your relationship with a man who's about to get married, and he clearly distrusts the two of you to respect the sanctity of that marriage.

I personally wouldn\u2019t go since you have not met the bride and you don\u2019t know if she is aware you dated the groom.

WHY? What does he mean by \"relationships like that\"? I've been married for over 2 decades. My husband has never been the least bit jealous of two different friends that I very briefly dated (and decided to just be friends with) before him. We have been to each other's weddings and have visited each other when we were back in town. My husband and I exchange cards with a woman that my husband liked and had a date or two with in HS. She lives overseas, but I would love to meet her and her family one day. Why can't you have good feelings about someone who was a happy part of your past or your SO's past?\n\nSecond of all, it's one thing for your bf to offer his opinion. What he did is TELL you what you NEED to do. He's upset, and you are doubting your own thinking. It may not be \"dump him\" grounds, but it is grounds for at least paying attention to how you two relate.", "My wife was separated when we met, obviously divorced when we married and her former husband and his new partner came to our wedding. My wife went to his wedding when he remarried .\n\nQuite why civility and friendship should be considered troublesome is beyond me.\n\nAbsolutely NTA and a two-week relationship can only just be considered a relationship. I can't imagine you went out as boyfriend and girlfriend more than a handful of times.\n\nGo to the wedding, have a great time, wish your mate and his new wife a happy life and tell your current partner not to be such a curmudgeon.", "YWNBTA.  The ex is your friend.  Not for nothing, but I have been married for 28 years.  At our wedding there were 2 exes on his side, and 3 on mine.  Not every ex, ever, but the ones we had remained very good friends with.  Just and example, not a how-to.  We were 29 and 36 then, thus the amount of exes in the running...", "I couldn\u2019t say it better, myself. NTA, OP.", "I'm kind of confused by your comment when you say I'm \"keeping guys on the back burner\"? I don't have an emotional or romantic investment in my former partner and if that ex is getting married how would that be a backup plan? I don't understand.", "For this reason... I'd say sending your regrets is the way to go.\n\nNot because there's a huge drama in it. But if you all live in the same city and you've never met her over 2+ years time of their relationship, you're just not a close friend of the couple. You don't actually know that she wants you there or will feel uncomfortable about it. \n\nIf you really do want to go (maybe there's a larger friend group going you don't want to exclude yourself from), try to make some effort at a double date or other group event so you can meet the bride."]}
