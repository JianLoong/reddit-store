{"id": 15253, "submission_id": "12t05m4", "title": "AITA for flipping out that he spent my cats vet money to take his dog to the vet?", "selftext": "I was saving money to get my cats fixed, up to date on shots and all that (I have 4- which I fostered originally but ended up keeping due to other issues). I've had them for maybe 10 months I believe. \n\nMy husband has had a dog for 2 years. I say \"his\" dog, not because I do not love her to bits but because she is most definitely a one person dog and she hands down prefers my husband. They are basically attached at the hip and she has anxiety/sadness whenever he is gone (will stay in her kennel until he returns). She will interact with me very briefly before she has no interest. She's a good girl, but definitely my husband's. \n\nI saved enough for my cats vet bills (totaling roughly $400- which was just an estimate that the vet gave me). I kept it in a shoe box in the closet. My husband knew about it and what it was for. Well, I had gone to the closet to count the money, as I was about to make the appointment for the cats and found it was gone. All of it. My husband was also gone, so was his dog, but this wasn't exactly not normal. He brings her everywhere he can. I call him, no answer. \n\nHe calls me back ten minutes ago and tells me he had to rush his dog to the vet because she was \"acting funny\" and couldn't hold herself up. He told me he used my money. He cant even pay me back unless business picks back up (we own a company but right now things are rough). Turns out his dog had a contact high because his ignorant buddy/foreman decided to blow weed smoke in her face. So he used all of my cats vet bill money over his dog having a contact high and yes, I'm pissed. My cats getting fixed isn't a *huge* deal (all female). I just wanted to get it done and over with because of the howling when they are in heat and because they are outdoor cats and there's male strays in the neighborhood (farm cats). But still, I don't think that's the point. I told him I was pissed and that this was unacceptable and he retorted with \"I was in a complete panic. I thought she was dying.\" So I asked him directly if he **saw** this dude blow smoke in her face and he said yes. So I asked why the fuck he didn't put two and two together and what symptoms she had that were so severe that he had to take my cats vet money to begin with and he told me \"well she kept closing her eyes and rocking back and forth\". Maybe because I'm an \"outsider\" on the perspective end but I would have been able to tell she was contact high and not blown $380 for the vet to tell me that. I told him I fully expect his foreman to pay us back that money, since he did it, and I haven't let him off the hook for taking my money to begin with. He says I'm an AH because \"what if it happened to your fucking cats? I was panicked and thought she was dying. You're heartless.\" AITA?\n\nETA: when we got the animals, business was booming. Our business started plunging last month due to lack of demand- which is the first time this has happened in the 8 years we have been up and running. We didn't just get animals we couldn't afford.\n\nMy cats are farm cats. I don't care about your \"keep your cats inside, bad pet owner\" talk. Farm cats help keep the mouse population at bay. That's what they are intended for.

Husband is a Royal AH. Since it's your husband's friend's fault. Tell him to get the money from him. If not what's your husband got that can be sold.", "NTA. I\u2019d be pissed too, and I have a cat and a dog.\n\nYour husband stole from you, no ifs/buts.\n\nHowever, the circumstances were understandable. The dog did present with symptoms that appeared to represent an emergency, most people wouldn\u2019t think of the longer-term consequences of this and would just seek treatment for their pet through any means necessary. This explains his intent but doesn\u2019t negate the impact, both on you and your cats (and by extension him because of their howling you describe when they\u2019re in heat).\n\nHaving said that, he needs to seek reimbursement for your money ASAP, no excuses. You two also need to have a discussion about boundaries, permission and shared resource in times of emergencies to avoid a similar situation in the future. Pet insurance is also worth its weight on gold in cases of emergencies. And perhaps consider storing your cash in the bank next time, much easier to avoid thefts that way.", "NTA and he should press the foreman for the money as you suggested. He took your money without informing you at all. Honestly, that shows he can't be trusted to know where you are hiding your money from now onwards.", "NTA...and OP I'd check to see what the visit actually cost. \n\nOne of two things happened:\n\n- Your husband didn't tell the vet about the weed smoke, either because he didn't piece it together or because he was trying to hide it, meaning the vet did a bunch of testing to uncover it which is how the bill got that high.\n\n- Your husband took the dog to the vet and just kept the rest of the money. Have you actually seen a receipt or proof of payment? \n\nEither way, get your own bank account. Not blaming the victim, just saying that you can no longer trust cash in your house to be safe.", "NTA BUT your husband surely is! Where I live I have had dogs ( and cats)dumped on my place who were having methamphetamine issues. Nasty people either think it is funny to \u201cgive\u201d their pets this crap or don\u2019t care enough about their pets and they get into the crap. It is dangerous. Yes, I know weed isn\u2019t nearly as bad for an animal as meth, BUT for your husband to let his friend do this? Stupid and silly. And it cost you a bunch a money. Is there a place in your area that will spay your cats at reduced rate? If you PM me, I may be able to help you with that. I have gotten many stray cats fixed throughout the years. Sorry for the rant, but your husband is ridiculous.", "NTA at all. Your husband is and his lil friend the foreman is too. It actually made me a little angry.  If you have a humane society in your area they'll help you with your cats or lead you to a place that can help you get it all done for little to no cost. Also maybe ask a shelter, they usually have connections to low cost vets and things like that. I've had situations where money was tight and the humane society helped me find a low cost vet one time and gave me food and litter before too.", "You have a right to be angry. In the future, don't save up money in a shoebox. Get your own personal savings account.", "NTA. What state do you live in OP? Some places will spay and neuter cats for free or super reduced cost since it helps with stray population control. If you haven\u2019t already I\u2019d maybe ask a subreddit for your state or town if they know any places like this or do some digging on google.

That\u2019s a huge red flag and not okay. What happens if an emergency happens with one of your cats? Now, there is no money to help them. It\u2019s interesting that your husband didn\u2019t care that his foreman was abusing and poisoning his dog but suddenly gave a crap when he thought she was dying. He sounds like a jerk and not very bright. Certain substances can be toxic to dogs. I feel like this is basic knowledge, easily googled.

Also he should make sure he has an emergency fund set aside for any situation that may come up. \n\nYou should learn to keep your money in a separate account that he has zero access to instead of in a shoe box. Also as a cat owner myself I can tell you damn well that it is necessary to fix your cats, if you don't or wait too late they will become pregnant over and over until your over run with cats. It also decreases their risk of cancer the sooner you fix them. Unfixed they have an increased risk of uterine issues and breast tumors.\n\nFinally 400 dollars for all 4 cats, or just one? Because I want to know who's fixing your cats if it's so cheap.", "ESH.\n\nYour husband stealing your money because he was dumb is bad, but you also suck for your cat ownership habits.\n\n* You have four cats you cannot afford, because you can't keep them up to date on shots and being spayed.\n* In spite of this, you keep them as outdoor cats. Having outdoor cats is bad in general, but when they don't have shots you're now exposing them to surprise pregnancy or disease, neither of which you can afford.\n* These are cats you were fostering, meaning that you almost certainly had options besides keeping them.\n\nYou cannot afford pets, and you are doing them a disservice by keeping them (and again, outdoor cats are bad in general).\n\nE: To respond to the added info, being barn cats does justify having them as outdoor cats... if they're spayed and kept up to date with shots. And saying that business took a downturn \"last month\" does not add up here, because cats should be spayed before 5 months, and you've had them for at least twice that time, before you had financial troubles. This means you could afford to take care of your pets but chose not to, which makes you one of the assholes in this story.", "I think NTA. it was a bad move of him,  althought i must say i maybe would have taken the money as well, but its the first time i heard the phrase \"contact high\", so if i were really tpotally worried id value a possible death of my dog highter than waiting a longer time to get your cats fixed. \n\nbut yes, even with your ETA mark, it still counts for me, dont have that many pets if you cant afford it. if business was booming for years you had enough time to put away and save some money for such cases. did you never save money for the case important things get broken, or something?  i can understand if someone doesnt have thousands laying around, but if business is going well saving some hundreds shouldnt be that hard.", "If they're not fiixed ,they shouldn't be outside. Period. YTA for potentially adding to the overpopulation and a very hard , sad and dangerous life of innocent animals. Do whatever u have to to get them fixed IMMEDIATELY or don't have any animals.
