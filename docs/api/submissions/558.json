So security thought he was trying to wash his sharpie off that they put on, and they kicked him out. My boyfriend asked them why he was kicked out even though they were about to leave, and he was pretty drunk so he got kicked out too. My boyfriend asked if he could go back and get his vape which he left on the table, and security said no since they were already out the doors and the bar has a no reentrance policy.\n\nThey all came back home and my boyfriend was obviously drunk and upset, his friends weren\u2019t nearly as drunk as he was. They started arguing and my boyfriend asked if we could leave so we did. The whole way home he was crying and upset over losing his vape. I listened to him the whole time and acknowledged his feelings.\n\nWhen we got home he kept talking about it and he blamed his friend getting kicked out for him losing his vape.. even though he was the one who forgot it on the table. I told him it was because the bar has a no reentrance policy, and he should stop blaming his friend and saying he\u2019s going to stop being friends with him. \n\nThen he starts yelling at me all because I said that, and says I\u2019m not being supportive of him and asked what I would do if he wasn\u2019t supportive of what happened with my day because \u201cit was like the same thing.\u201d I told him it was absolutely not the same thing and he\u2019s just drunk. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667065596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygpzcx/aita_for_not_being_supportive_of_my_boyfriend/", "score": 703, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s vile behaviour even if you\u2019re intoxicated.", "Good God, not the same thing. You sure you wanna be with this guy?  NTA.", "Have you considered that you and your boyfriend are severely mismatched in terms of maturity? He gets drunk enough to argue with security, get kicked out and is whining about a vape. You\u2019re dealing with life and death in a NICU. One of you is a functional and mature adult, and the other is your boyfriend. \n\nNTA, but seriously, you may want to ask some tough questions about this relationship.", "NTA\n\nYou should revisit this conversation once he\u2019s sobered up and see if he stands by his statement. If he does- dump him immediately.", "100% NTA. \nIs he honestly comparing losing his vape to losing a baby? And blaming his friend for an innocent mistake? \nI'm sorry but your boyfriend sounds immature.\nBut you're NTA.", "NTA\n\nI hope he understands the difference between a baby dying and losing his vape once he's sober. Even drunk though this comparison is quite assholey.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is really that, a boy. He needs to grow up! How pathetic, getting so terribly drunk and crying over losing his vape (while he can easliy get a new one) and then claiming it's the same as what you went through. WTF", "NTA\n\nFriend and he got drunk and did stupid shit that got them kicked out of a bar. \n\nThis is not the same as what you went thru. If he truly thinks losing a vape pipe while drunk is the same as having to watch an infant die that couldn\u2019t be saved, he is a monster.", "NTA, and unless he is much much better sober, he is not mature enough for you. Alcohol can make people act off, but to compare a lost vape to a lost baby\u2026that is not cool.", "You went through a horrible experience and are very understandably grieving, and your boyfriend just went out drinking? And came back crying because he lost his vape? You deserve a better boyfriend. NTA, and I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "NTA. \n\nYour boyfriend made poor decisions and has to deal with the consequences. \n\nNow bringing up him screwing up when drunk is unlikely to fix anything either. Probably best to save that conversation for when he\u2019s sobered up some", "NTA\nYou have a stressful job when it is going well.

I mean maybe you shouldn\u2019t argue with a drunk person BUT you were stating facts. And how dare he compare his day to yours. It\u2019s NOT the same thing at all. Not even close. Non healthcare people never quite understand how what we do affects us. If he still feels that way sober tho. Then y\u2019all need to talk", "NTA. Your BF is being incredibly immature, this being exacerbated by his being drunk. Getting thrown out of a bar and losing some paraphenalia in no way compares to having seen a baby pass away. Since it is your job, I imagine it is something you have to endure with some regularity, but it is also  something you must never be too blas\u00e9 to be upset about. The minute you cannot grieve for a baby passing away, is the minute you are burnt out.", "NTA. Also NICU nurses are fucking warriors and I love you. You should all be honored every single day. \n\nSigned - mom of a 28-weeker.", "NTA You should\u2019ve brought up that that exact thing was happening in the moment- you had a horrible day he didn\u2019t seem to care and he wasn\u2019t supportive-he went to the bar with his friend to get drunk and have a nice time. Nta mans was being a fiend missin his vape and cutting ties with his friend for that would be a stupid move.", "NTA - default response Drunk people are generally always the assholes.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s getting that agitated over a vape?! RUN!", "Yikes. NTA.", "NTA- I hope he is less tiresome when he is sober.   \nNo it's not the same thing, a child passed away. \n\nIt's annoying and frustrating when you lose stuff because of drunken shenanigans, but no, it doesn't compare to your day. He's being a dramatic as hell for a vape that can be replaced.", "Arguing with a drunk person is like arguing with a toddler. \n\nNTA.", "\"Baby, I'm going to try to be supportive here.

NTA.", "I am the mother of a NICU baby and the NICU nurses were some of the most supportive, loving, and amazing hospital staff I have ever worked with. The fact that someone wants to compare losing a replaceable object to a human freaking being and a child no less makes my blood boil.

Thank you for your work and I hope you are well paid for it and get the support you need to keep those babies healthy. :)", "NTA but it sounds like you may matured out of this relationship. Is this really the kind of shit you want to put up with? He sounds like dead weight girl.", "My wife works as a LAD nurse and has had to deal with what you have several times over the years, and every time she, like you, was feeling awful. Between myself, her parents, her siblings, her friends and her coworkers, none of us have walked away from her when she needed us, none of us said \u201cMy day was worse\u201d, and none of us have yelled at her after one of those days, because every single one of us knows that is inhumane, uncaring and flat out wrong. He is despicable for not doing the same.\nI\u2019m so, so sorry for what you went through, its something no one should have to experience. I hope you don\u2019t have to experience it again, and I hope you dump your trash boyfriend. You deserve far better.", "NTA. No exp.aination needed.\n\nNow, off topic, thank you for your work in NICU. It's a calling and means so much to so many.", "NTA. You do a difficult job and you need to be very proud and self assured with what you do. o I wish you all the best in your career and hope you stay.  People need nurses like you.  Now, your partner.  He's probably not an asshole, but he does need to grow up and realise what you do is important and stressful. Speak to him the next day when he's sober.", "NTA- He needs to not drink or use common sense. He should have asked either security or one of the staff for his vape or he should call the bar about it when he's sober, since there was a no reentering policy. (I'm not sure how they would handle lost purses or wallets if neither of these are an option).", "NTA, but it's pretty futile to argue or try to reason with drunk people. Ignore him, decide if you can tolerate him while he's stupid drunk and use that to guide your future with this person.", "NTA. The person who is TA for not being supportive is the 13yr old who went out with his friends instead of consoling you, and then cried about his annoying vape and though it equated to a dead baby.  It always the one to jump on the \u2018breakup\u2019 bandwagon, but seriously think hard about staying with this guy - he is going nowhere in life.", "NTA. He\u2019s comparing apples to a baby dying. Not even in the same realm as each other.", "NTA and I really hope you mean ex-bf because you deserve way better than this dude. You lost a baby that was in your care. Yeah it's part of the job, but that's traumatic as FUCK! The fact that he went out and partied instead of being with and comforting you shows how much he really cares for you. Then he tries to equate a dead baby and a lost vape? Nahhhhhh. Throw the whole man away.", "I'm so sorry you lost a patient \u2764\ufe0f and have to deal with a dumb drunk boyfriend on top of it.", "You know, OP, you sound like you might enjoy dating a whole-ass adult instead of this self-centered child.", "NTA - I think you\u2019re right to reconsider this relationship and I never say that lightly.", "NTA. He compared a baby passing away to losing his vape? Seriously? I know he was drunk but he seriously needs to give his head a shake and wake up to reality.", "NTA", "NTA thankfully he's a bf and not a husband.", "NTA - seriously think whether you want to stay longer with him.  His priorities are really messed up.", "NTA", "Why are you dating a teenager??", "NTA. But why are you with such a wingy drunk?", "Maybe replace him with an emotional support dog? I dunno, it could help with the trauma of the job.\nNTA anyway", "He needs to man up and stop crying over a vape, it is embarrassing.", "NTA.  First thank you for the job you do.  My son was in NICU long ago and is fine due to the wonderful NICU staff.  If your BF regularly gets wasted and acts like a big baby consider whether you want this relationship to continue.  He was drunk and acted dumb.  What are you supposed to support? His drunken behavior?  Nope.", "I'm sorry, but what were you supposed to be supportive of? His excessive drinking? His behaviour that got him thrown out? Being angry at the friends who brought him home safely? Dude is an ass. NTA", "NTA. Losing a Patient let alone a Pediatric patient is never easy and is nowhere near the same of leaving a vape at a Bar. The fact that he went out drinking with friends instead of staying at home with you kinda makes me wonder what sort of person he is when he's sober. I work in EMS and the last time i had a rough pediatric call that didn't have a good ending i was pretty bummed about it for a few days and my wife everything she could to support me which really went a long way in helping me cope with the situation. Not one to give relationship advice online but you should rethink your situation and maybe find someone who will give you the support you Deserve. Thanks for what you do.", "Wow.  You dealt with a baby dying and he lost his vape when he was drunk.\n\nNTA I hope he is ashamed of himself in the morning.", "NTA.  Your BF doesn't need support, he needs to grow up.  Does he blame someone else every time something goes wrong?  \n\nHis losing a vape does not compare with the death of a child you cared for; I hope your BF isn't like this when he's sober.", "NTA this is why randy from South Park said vaping is for p****s", "NTA. Sorry I laughed a bit. Things can seem more dramatic when you're wasted. I love my vape too and would be pissed if I lost it somehow but..... I'm also a registered nurse and I know how it feels to loose a patient. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's even remotely similar. I'm sure he will feel embarrassed when his head clears. Ask him if he could go to the bar or call them. They may have lost and found stuff there. I wish you all the best!", "NTA", "Pls just keep in mind he was DRUNK!!!! You should talk to him about when fully sober, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be much more understanding cause he is under influence. You\u2019re not the asshole, he is, but he has a valid excuse which is being under influence", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then he's back again, \"ok my girl I have taken the potatoes to their friends!! They aren't lonely anymore!! Let's get you inside.\" The thought of those lonely potatoes partying it up with the carrots and celery cheered me up immensely so I finally allowed him to help me inside. I thought maybe I would be spared from teasing the next morning since I was high as a kite at the time, but no. Instead I discovered the next morning that as I had slept my family had been playing a fun game of, how many potatoes can we put on top of her before she wakes up. (It's 13, in case you were wondering.) To this day everyone makes a big show about, ohh, don't let her see that you ordered only one lonely potato as your dinner side!! Or will do stuff like hand me a box of Kleenex when we're walking through the produce section of the store. Gotta love family lol", "My mom was born in 1938 and still alive!", "So you had a really bad day at work, and instead of doing something with you, he runs off to get drunk with a friend?

It\u2019s only after gaining some maturity and perspective that they ever feel any shame. If at all. \n\nGood luck. You deserve somebody whose grown up enough to support your career and be a stable adult after you\u2019ve had bad days on the unit.

Based on your comment regarding thoughts of leaving him I feel I can safely assume that this type of behavior from him isn't just when he's drunk. It sounds like he's a Me Me Me type of person and if I'm right you should definitely leave him. \n\nSide note I just want to add you are Hella strong to do the work you do and you deserve better.

And was neither pregnant nor drunk. It was a silly exercise in a beginners acting class where we each got an orange and spent the entire class \"bonding\" with it. Throwing it in the air, looking at the peel for a really long time for some reason. Towards the end we were told \"now very quietly, to yourself...tell your orange exactly how you feel.\" Then we had to peel it and eat it.
