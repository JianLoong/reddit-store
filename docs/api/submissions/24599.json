I don\u2019t know how to feel it\u2019s definitely different. The guy is some type of engineer, has 4 kids, and is a widower.\n\nAnyway, today was the fourth time I\u2019ve seen them. We went to their church and had dinner. After, that me and the twin boys(18mm) were hanging out in my room. I don\u2019t remember how we got to it but we were talking about our parents. They went on to say something like \u201cwe are basically the same just our mom died and your dad died\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean to be rude but I told him we aren\u2019t the same. When my dad died I watched the strongest person I know lose all of his strength and suffer day by day for two years with no mercy. After that we lost our home, were paycheck to paycheck, and I ate peanut butter sandwiches so many days in a row that the smell of peanut butter makes me sick today. At 14 my favorite cousin got shot by a stray bullet at a party and died in my arms. I literally had to spend countless hours to bring my family up to where we are now. \n\nI didn\u2019t mean anything by it but that\u2019s the truth. Even though their mom died, she died painlessly, they had plenty of female role models, they lived comfortably, and they had to make 0 sacrifices. \n\nMy mom thinks I over reacted and my best friend says the same. They say I should apologize even though. I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong I just told the truth. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I left a valuable part out because I forgot about it and mid answering a person in the replies I remembered.\n\nAnyway, the reason we were talking about this in the first place was because they didn\u2019t know how my dad died but I already knew how their mom died so I told them. They started asking some other things about my life. I eventually got to the story of how my cousin got shot and died at a party and how I got shot. They asked me how did the bullet get out. I told them it wasn\u2019t in a spot safe enough to take it out. They asked a few other questions and then one of them said \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lie that\u2019s lowkey cool\u201d about the bullet being inside of me still. That pissed me off but the \u201cwe are basically the same\u201d was it. A lot of y\u2019all are trying to say that I was trying to compete but I wasn\u2019t. It was more of a \u201cthat\u2019s wtf you got out of what I just told you\u2026 that it was cool and we are basically the same\u201d.", "created_utc": 1691986822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qk2uy/aita_for_telling_my_moms_boyfriends_son_that_just/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, comparing traumas isn't necessarily productive or compassionate. It might be better to approach these situations with empathy, understanding that while your challenges were intense and formative, others' feelings and experiences are also valid.

What your loss does *not* entitle you to, however, is being insensitive to someone else's loss and undermining the depth of their own grief. \n\nThose two boys lost their mother, and they're grieving their own loss just as you're grieving yours. Their phrasing\u2014implying that you're the \"same\"\u2014might've been immature, but it seems like they were just looking to connect with you given that you've all experienced the loss of a parent.

I actually read it mainly as a statement about having both had parents died except the genders of the deceased parent were flipped. It does sound like the aftermath of the death (the poverty etc) was much worse for you... but I just don't think that he was trying to suggest absolutely everything about your lives was parallel. It seems to me he was very likely just noting , 'we've both had parents die, but in my case it was my mom and in your case it was your dad.'  It's clear you're pretty raw and on edge, which is understandable all things considered.", "YTA since when is grief a competition? You all lost a parent what is worse enough already.
