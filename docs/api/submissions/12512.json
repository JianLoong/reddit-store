I tend to be irritatingly patient with my kid. I had a \"friend\" from a mom's group once tell me to \"stop being so okay with everything! it makes me look bad, and I'm doing my best too!\"\n\nBut sometimes, that's an *effort*. Sometimes it's a mask. You will at some point, get tired of feeling like you're talking to yourself. Like you've tried literally everything, and no one has a solution. There are days... where maybe you don't \"hate\" your child, but... unless you've been specifically taught how to process those emotions, you can't think of another way to describe how you feel. \n\nIt's not \"normal\" to hate your child. But it's also not normal for your child to be 4 years old for 27 years and still kick and bite you. And some moms are dealing with that. \n\nI don't think I've ever \"hated\" my child. But there have been times when I've wondered if I was up for the challenge. If maybe I wasn't enough to handle it. And there have been other times when I *have* wanted a break. Just one day where my kiddo could \"act normal\". \n\nAnd I say this as someone who is *also* on the spectrum. \n\nI also say this as someone who was *equally* appalled that people could talk about their children this way when my kiddo was first diagnosed.\n\nBut... sometimes parents need a safe place to vent... to say horrible things so that they *don't* say those things to their children.\n\n*I* couldn't be part of a group like that. But I understand that a lot of people need it.\n\nThe thing is, though... your child should never be aware of those feelings. Even if that is the purpose of the group, you're *right*. They shouldn't be saying those things in front of their children. \n\nThe purpose is to \"vent\" *without* harming the children.\n\nIf the children hadn't been there, they wouldn't have been AHs. The fact that the children were there? Oh they absolutely are. \n\nIf the children hadn't been there, you would have been the AH. Speaking in defense of the children who *were* there? I think that puts you solidly into not the AH territory.\n\nAs for the recommendation? I don't think it's appropriate to suggest that sort of group as a first step. I think *most* specialists would/do begin with an informational support group. \n\nThis sort of \"drop them in the deep end so they know what to expect\" thinking is rarely beneficial.

Also, those moms need individual therapy to help with their resentment issues. The group sessions sounds more like gossip groups.", "Everyone saying Y T A is clearly disregarding the fact that the parents are saying these things in earshot of their children along with the fact that what they were saying generally has a lot of very sexist undertones that I feel nobody was paying any mind to.

It might have been kinder for you not to say anything, but it wasn't kind of them to say such scary things to you either and unload on you like that when they don't know you and you just received a diagnosis. You just don't do that to a newcomer in any group. A good support group will offer you information, guidance, support, comradery, and friendship. \n\nI agree with other posters. Get a second opinion and find another group. A friend of mine belongs to one that is as close as family with spouses and aunts/uncles attending for support. They do family activities, and nights out where a few stay home to babysit, playdates, and even help prepare for and attend the school meeting with each other for support.

Group therapy is so helpful for one another, but it seems that the negativity and hopelessness has gotten to a lot of these moms in a way where it could be unhealthy. Venting about children and raising a kid with autism is something that is so valid. Of course there are going to be difficulties and days where you feel like you may hate your kid, or don't get enough help, and venting about it in a group setting with others who can relate may help a lot. The difference here though, is that they decided to unload this at you, someone who's new and doesn't have much time to process the ASD diagnosis, and tell you that everything is going to become awful. Thats setting you up to resent your kid. And to say all this in front of their child who is currently there? Its awful to me as well. The point of group therapy is to air out your issues, but to also do it in a way that is supportive and sets you up for success. This seems like a spiral of negativity. Instead of pilin all this on, it should have been a conversation where you are engaged. Questions like \"How do you feel?\" Or \"Have you had tough days yet?\" Or even \"For me, days can get so stressful and I need to be alone. Here's what I do to cope and relax so I don't get overwhelmed.\" It should be 1) a GROUp conversation, not them talking at you, 2) a private conversation without the children there (if they're going to talk about them that way), and 3) built in a way where it makes people feel safe, uplifted, and encouraged.", "NTA.\n\nI feel bad for the children present that heard such terrible remarks from their mothers. If you want to vent, vent, but not in front of the children! If you can't make a meeting without bringing your kid... Keep your mouth shut, exchange numbers, and then call and vent once the kid is asleep!\n\nWtf is wrong with those women. Just because they have children with autism doesn't mean those children don't understand what's being said directly in front of them!", "NTA, but I'm not prepared to call mothers in desperately difficult situations who are just trying to get through their day AHs, either. If I have to pass judgment here, it'd be on whoever is supposed to be in charge of this meeting who doesn't have some kind of organized playgroup in a separate space to keep the kids occupied so that the mothers can vent and interact with one another without the risk of their kids overhearing anything potentially hurtful or upsetting.", "NTA sounds like those women really shouldn't have had their kids along. Besides that, they apparently wanted to use you for validation. They should have let you get the feel of the place while they got a sense of where you are in this process. They're burned out for sure, but it's made them far too insensitive to their children and to you.", "NTA\n\nOnly because they were saying these things in plain earshot of their children. \n\nThat tells me more about those mothers than anything else.  They don't care about their children. If they did, they wouldn't say such things in their presence.  Doesn't matter if they don't think they know what's being said. \n\nImagine if it was a support group for mothers of deaf children, and they said such things while their children were present and looking at tablets? Is that OK?\n\nOr if a mother vents in the presence of her sleeping child with cancer. That's fine too? \n\nWould you vent out loud to someone about your SO/family/friends while they are present, saying things like you hate them and blame them for your misery?  No? Well why not?\n\nVenting can be beneficial.  Venting in the presence of the apparent source of said frustration is rude at best, abusive at worst.", "Oof\u2026I understand venting can be healthy but idk this is tough. I wanna say NAH because you didn\u2019t sign up for a \u2018venting\u2019 based support group. What you wanted was advice and if you can\u2019t relate to how they\u2019re feeling then the support group wouldn\u2019t have worked out.", "Gentle YTA\n\nI am sorry you had this experience. I also have great compassion for you and all the other parents and caregivers of children with ASD because I worked with this population and obviously this diagnosis, no matter how much you love your child, adds stress and difficulty to the process of raising them. Obviously it was not appropriate for the mom to say what she did in earshot of her child, but I am not going to judge her because I can only imagine what the rest of her day looked like. I think that perhaps she may have not chosen her words well, but the sentiment of \"I hate my child\" might have been trying to convey how deeply frustrated she was with the situation. Especially for families with children on the spectrum who are non-verbal and have more severe behavior issues, it is very difficult and there is little respite or support for them outside of the school day.\n\nAs for the comments about spouses and marriage... I would extend these mothers some grace. I'm sure you're already aware of the statistic that 80% of marriages with an autistic child end in divorce. I would not call someone's husband a deadbeat, nor would I blame it on the child. It's just the sad reality that this diagnosis puts a LOT of stress on the entire family. I think venting to others who understand what you are going through (isolation is a huge problem for caregivers) can be helpful, but I'm sorry this group didn't work out for you.", "YTA for passing judgment in a support group. This group is probably the only space these women have to express their thoughts and feelings about their situations. I'm sure they don't actually hate their children, but many humans used embellished language when describing stress. \n\nYou don't have to return if it's not your vibe, but your little lecture was not cool.", "INFO: Have you ever been in a support group before this one? When he gave you the information about attending, did he inform you about how group therapy/support works?", "I would have done the same. Disgusting behavior from those mothers.\n\nNTA.", "Severe autism can absolutely be really hard for parents and caregivers to handle, and having an autistic child contributed to my sister in laws divorce. I doubt those women actually hate their children, and yeah, it probably wasn\u2019t your place to lecture them all for not speaking about their experiences the way you would like YTA", "Touchy topic. Im not going to even remotely pretend I know what its like be in this situation, I dont even have any children, so im not in a position to be judging the others.\n\nTo you, however, I dont think your the A. My opinion? That wouldnt be a good group to be around, negative atmosphere will sink into you over time. You probably could have done without blowing up, but then it depends how you said what you said. \n\nId recommend finding a more positive group, good luck op", "YTA for your reaction of lecturing them about what you think is wrong with them. That was indeed rude and out of line. Don't like the group? Fine. Don't want to be a part of it? Fine. Smile, nod and be polite, and go on your merry way. Whatever YOU think of the group is YOUR issue, not theirs.\n\nThat being said, that doesn't sound like a support group to me. Support can include venting, but it also ought to offer experience, strength and hope. It should be a group of people facing a similar issue offering empathy and ideas. This wasn't that, and I wouldn't be back, either.", "YTA. You were an AH to those mothers. They have far more experience than you do so it\u2019s likely you haven\u2019t reached the point that they are at yet. That being said, it was for venting. Nothing toxic about it.

Set a calendar reminder for yourself 1 year from now and re-read this post. \n\nI'm sure you aren't the first or last to be absolutely shocked by the realities and experiences of others who are raising an ASD kid.

Furthermore you should have been a little more kind I know you think your husband is great but your kid just got diagnosed, will you come back next year and tell us if you are still together?\n\nThey are trying to tell you reality, even kids that don\u2019t have behavioral issues often cause a relationship to break. My best friend was with her kids dad for 10 years before they had a baby he didn\u2019t last two years, he raised three other daughters who lived with them so he wasn\u2019t a deadbeat. That kid broke their relationship though. Obviously it\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault it was a different parenting styles and different values and all of that that came to a head once there was this new responsibility and stressor in the relationship.  Nobody is BLAMING their kid they\u2019re IDENTIFYING the situation that caused the end of their marriage.\n\nWho are you to even question that and tell them they are wrong?

You are right it is NOT normalized to hate your child in any form.", "I think nta, \n\nI get if it was a venting group, they stil should have a room for the kids to play separately.

To feel safe sharing.  You were very judging.\n* There should have been a moderator (doesn't sound like one was there) that stepped in as soon as the other group members began projecting their experiences onto you.  There should be no \"you will feel like this.  you will have this bad thing happen to you\".  That is very toxic and unhealthy. There should only be sharing \"I felt this.  I had this happen to me\".  Sharing the \"I\" stuff is healthy venting.  Projecting the \"you\" stuff is unhealthy and toxic.  The group dynamic was absolutely horrible and out of control.\n* The therapist slightly sucks because he should have been aware of how badly that group was run and he clearly wasn't.  I don't think he would recommend it if he knew what it was actually like.\n\nIdeally in a support group each person can share their own personal experiences and sometimes another person can chime in and explain how they overcame a similar experience.  There should never be a sentence like \"there will be days you absolutely hate your child\" directed at a new member, but people should be allowed to say \"some days I absolutely hate my child\".\n\nI hope that you can give support groups a second shot because they can be very helpful but you should find out if its moderated before going.

They also eventually become a sanctuary you can rely on for comfort.\n\nEdit:  Also, we had a teacher in school that wanted a meeting with us and another school official.

If these people openly state they hate their kids in public, imagine what the kids endure in private. \n\nFurther, I would not be shocked to find out that the specialist who recommended this group knew full well about this already.

But I can never say that my brother gave me severe PTSD after trying to kill me multiple times when I was a kid, and that although I love him, I struggle to be around him now as an adult, because... well, that's GOT to just be close-minded discrimination against all autistic people, and not just the occasional reality of severe autism.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I would have pushed for a family support group for me and my husband - you know the other 1/2 parent??  \n\nMaybe that is part of the issue for some of these women.  They were told it\u2019s their job to care for the kid and the husbands were absentee all because a doctor said women need to be the caretaker and needed support.  \n\nNot that it\u2019s your job to change their mind but misogynistic parenting isn\u2019t healthy.", "Both of my children were diagnosed late, 8 years old. None of what presented to teachers seemed remotely like something to be concerned about, we'd simply made reasonable working adjustments for our family where needed, and didn't have to do anything further until they were well into elementary school ages. Everything else benign was just normal behavior that wasn't just normal for them, but for myself as well. I received my diagnosis with ASD in my 30s, when the kids got theirs. It's amazing how much we are taught to mask or figure out a work around for so many things. \nAnyway, they are in highschool now, and I cannot imagine saying such awful things like that in front of my kids. \nSome of it may be some hyperbole, it's probably not true hate for the most part, and men are six more times likely to leave a sick wife, no idea what the stats are for parents of kids with anything that many people believe is a disability across the board is for divorce rates, but I'd imagine it's rougher than the usual average. But regardless, that really sounds like an awful environment all around and I don't blame you for saying something about it and walking. Not just a bag fit, but gross form. Vent away, sure, but never with kids either there or awake.\n\nI hope you find a better supportive group/practice for your family. And if you ever want to chat about any of it either because you want ideas or just an ear, feel free to DM me.", "The fact that he didn't even prepare you for it as a venting group and just labeled it as a support group, then tried to backtrack after is what leaves a nasty taste for me. It's one thing to advocate for a venting group. They ARE necessary and needed in some cases. But venting groups are not support groups, and anywhere that you talk negatively about your children shouldn't have said children within earshot. It just sounds like a hate group, tbh.", "Just because they use tablets to keep the kids occupied during a meeting for grownups doesn't mean they do that all the time. They probably had to bring the kids because they are single mothers and maybe they can't afford or find a babysitter with the knowledge of taking care of autistic children.\n\nI don't think they are assholes to let the kids sit with tablets while being at a meeting. This is no different than having to bring your kid to a meeting with, for example, your bank, your doctor or your attorney, because you have no options for child care. Many people would let the kids sit with tablets in those situations, while they have a discussion with the other grownup(s). That doesn't make people assholes or bad parents. Unless they do it all the time, but we don't know that.\n\nI agree with the rest. They should not make assumptions about her marriage or partner, not assume that she would hate her child in the future.", "Thanks for the advice", "Therapists/doctors generally don't know what goes on in support groups.

They are the strongest and bravest people I know.", "Exactly, they're acting like the diagnosis is what made them autistic and not you know, being autistic!!\n\nTbh everyone is over sympathizing with the moms. *You* chose to have a child, that means *you* chose the possibility of having a disabled child. All of my oldest sister's favorite foods contain peanuts (PB, Reese's buttercups, her fav cereal etc..) Her son was dx with a severe peanut allergy at about 2~ yrs old. She had to give up all her favorite foods for the *chance* of a reaction, and until her son is old enough to take every proper precaution and accept the risk she will have to continue giving up all peanut products. Not once has she complained about it, because she chose to have kids, and that ment the possibility of something like this happening.

To give me another update on his LEGO project.", "Those kids didn\u2019t do anything on purpose\u2026 The reality is is children with special needs are incredibly taxing emotionally, mentally, and physically. They don\u2019t understand the consequences of their actions, and the sacrifices that the people around them have to make. These kids are innocent in the sense that they have no idea the harm they are causing people, but as a person who gets scratched, hit, and punched by her special needs son every day, I am telling you that it is hard to find him innocent when he is the reason my lip is bleeding. Throwing food and smearing it and shoving it everywhere, but he isn\u2019t gonna clean it up. Yelling at me all day when something doesn\u2019t go his way, and Breaking things because he doesn\u2019t understand money or instant gratification. \n\nYes, everyone needs to respect everyone. But being a mother to a special needs child is thankless, and no human being is a endless pit of patience. A lot of us are all doing our best, but we are using up all of our patience just trying to get through the day.", "I totally agreed with you, it\u2019s mentally and physically draining to handle children with special needs.\nMy point here is that they said it in front on the kids, it\u2019s gonna traumatise them hearing their own parents saying things about them and that they hate them, when they may or may not necessarily hate them.\nThey\u2019re tired and just need to vent, they could do it alone without the kids nearby, and it\u2019s totally okay to vent with parents of the same support group."]}
