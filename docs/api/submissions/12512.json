They also said \"be prepared for your husband to mostly or completely disengage.\" A few of them told me they were divorced and blamed their small children for being the cause.\n\nMy shock and, I admit, disgust, must have been all over my face.

I tend to be irritatingly patient with my kid. I had a \"friend\" from a mom's group once tell me to \"stop being so okay with everything! it makes me look bad, and I'm doing my best too!\"\n\nBut sometimes, that's an *effort*. Sometimes it's a mask. You will at some point, get tired of feeling like you're talking to yourself. Like you've tried literally everything, and no one has a solution. There are days... where maybe you don't \"hate\" your child, but... unless you've been specifically taught how to process those emotions, you can't think of another way to describe how you feel. \n\nIt's not \"normal\" to hate your child. But it's also not normal for your child to be 4 years old for 27 years and still kick and bite you. And some moms are dealing with that. \n\nI don't think I've ever \"hated\" my child. But there have been times when I've wondered if I was up for the challenge. If maybe I wasn't enough to handle it. And there have been other times when I *have* wanted a break. Just one day where my kiddo could \"act normal\". \n\nAnd I say this as someone who is *also* on the spectrum. \n\nI also say this as someone who was *equally* appalled that people could talk about their children this way when my kiddo was first diagnosed.\n\nBut... sometimes parents need a safe place to vent... to say horrible things so that they *don't* say those things to their children.\n\n*I* couldn't be part of a group like that. But I understand that a lot of people need it.\n\nThe thing is, though... your child should never be aware of those feelings. Even if that is the purpose of the group, you're *right*. They shouldn't be saying those things in front of their children. \n\nThe purpose is to \"vent\" *without* harming the children.\n\nIf the children hadn't been there, they wouldn't have been AHs. The fact that the children were there? Oh they absolutely are. \n\nIf the children hadn't been there, you would have been the AH. Speaking in defense of the children who *were* there? I think that puts you solidly into not the AH territory.\n\nAs for the recommendation? I don't think it's appropriate to suggest that sort of group as a first step. I think *most* specialists would/do begin with an informational support group. \n\nThis sort of \"drop them in the deep end so they know what to expect\" thinking is rarely beneficial.

Also, those moms need individual therapy to help with their resentment issues. The group sessions sounds more like gossip groups.", "Everyone saying YTA is clearly disregarding the fact that the parents are saying these things in earshot of their children along with the fact that what they were saying generally has a lot of very sexist undertones that I feel nobody was paying any mind to.

It might have been kinder for you not to say anything, but it wasn't kind of them to say such scary things to you either and unload on you like that when they don't know you and you just received a diagnosis. You just don't do that to a newcomer in any group. A good support group will offer you information, guidance, support, comradery, and friendship. \n\nI agree with other posters. Get a second opinion and find another group. A friend of mine belongs to one that is as close as family with spouses and aunts/uncles attending for support. They do family activities, and nights out where a few stay home to babysit, playdates, and even help prepare for and attend the school meeting with each other for support.

Group therapy is so helpful for one another, but it seems that the negativity and hopelessness has gotten to a lot of these moms in a way where it could be unhealthy. Venting about children and raising a kid with autism is something that is so valid. Of course there are going to be difficulties and days where you feel like you may hate your kid, or don't get enough help, and venting about it in a group setting with others who can relate may help a lot. The difference here though, is that they decided to unload this at you, someone who's new and doesn't have much time to process the ASD diagnosis, and tell you that everything is going to become awful. Thats setting you up to resent your kid. And to say all this in front of their child who is currently there? Its awful to me as well. The point of group therapy is to air out your issues, but to also do it in a way that is supportive and sets you up for success. This seems like a spiral of negativity. Instead of pilin all this on, it should have been a conversation where you are engaged. Questions like \"How do you feel?\" Or \"Have you had tough days yet?\" Or even \"For me, days can get so stressful and I need to be alone. Here's what I do to cope and relax so I don't get overwhelmed.\" It should be 1) a GROUp conversation, not them talking at you, 2) a private conversation without the children there (if they're going to talk about them that way), and 3) built in a way where it makes people feel safe, uplifted, and encouraged.", "NTA.\n\nI feel bad for the children present that heard such terrible remarks from their mothers. If you want to vent, vent, but not in front of the children! If you can't make a meeting without bringing your kid... Keep your mouth shut, exchange numbers, and then call and vent once the kid is asleep!\n\nWtf is wrong with those women. Just because they have children with autism doesn't mean those children don't understand what's being said directly in front of them!", "NTA, but I'm not prepared to call mothers in desperately difficult situations who are just trying to get through their day AHs, either. If I have to pass judgment here, it'd be on whoever is supposed to be in charge of this meeting who doesn't have some kind of organized playgroup in a separate space to keep the kids occupied so that the mothers can vent and interact with one another without the risk of their kids overhearing anything potentially hurtful or upsetting.", "NTA sounds like those women really shouldn't have had their kids along. Besides that, they apparently wanted to use you for validation. They should have let you get the feel of the place while they got a sense of where you are in this process. They're burned out for sure, but it's made them far too insensitive to their children and to you.", "NTA\n\nOnly because they were saying these things in plain earshot of their children. \n\nThat tells me more about those mothers than anything else.  They don't care about their children. If they did, they wouldn't say such things in their presence.  Doesn't matter if they don't think they know what's being said. \n\nImagine if it was a support group for mothers of deaf children, and they said such things while their children were present and looking at tablets? Is that OK?\n\nOr if a mother vents in the presence of her sleeping child with cancer. That's fine too? \n\nWould you vent out loud to someone about your SO/family/friends while they are present, saying things like you hate them and blame them for your misery?  No? Well why not?\n\nVenting can be beneficial.  Venting in the presence of the apparent source of said frustration is rude at best, abusive at worst.", "Oof\u2026I understand venting can be healthy but idk this is tough. I wanna say NAH because you didn\u2019t sign up for a \u2018venting\u2019 based support group. What you wanted was advice and if you can\u2019t relate to how they\u2019re feeling then the support group wouldn\u2019t have worked out.", "Gentle YTA\n\nI am sorry you had this experience. I also have great compassion for you and all the other parents and caregivers of children with ASD because I worked with this population and obviously this diagnosis, no matter how much you love your child, adds stress and difficulty to the process of raising them. Obviously it was not appropriate for the mom to say what she did in earshot of her child, but I am not going to judge her because I can only imagine what the rest of her day looked like. I think that perhaps she may have not chosen her words well, but the sentiment of \"I hate my child\" might have been trying to convey how deeply frustrated she was with the situation. Especially for families with children on the spectrum who are non-verbal and have more severe behavior issues, it is very difficult and there is little respite or support for them outside of the school day.\n\nAs for the comments about spouses and marriage... I would extend these mothers some grace. I'm sure you're already aware of the statistic that 80% of marriages with an autistic child end in divorce. I would not call someone's husband a deadbeat, nor would I blame it on the child. It's just the sad reality that this diagnosis puts a LOT of stress on the entire family. I think venting to others who understand what you are going through (isolation is a huge problem for caregivers) can be helpful, but I'm sorry this group didn't work out for you.", "YTA for passing judgment in a support group. This group is probably the only space these women have to express their thoughts and feelings about their situations. I'm sure they don't actually hate their children, but many humans used embellished language when describing stress. \n\nYou don't have to return if it's not your vibe, but your little lecture was not cool.", "INFO: Have you ever been in a support group before this one? When he gave you the information about attending, did he inform you about how group therapy/support works?", "I would have done the same. Disgusting behavior from those mothers.\n\nNTA.", "Severe autism can absolutely be really hard for parents and caregivers to handle, and having an autistic child contributed to my sister in laws divorce. I doubt those women actually hate their children, and yeah, it probably wasn\u2019t your place to lecture them all for not speaking about their experiences the way you would like YTA", "Touchy topic. Im not going to even remotely pretend I know what its like be in this situation, I dont even have any children, so im not in a position to be judging the others.\n\nTo you, however, I dont think your the A. My opinion? That wouldnt be a good group to be around, negative atmosphere will sink into you over time. You probably could have done without blowing up, but then it depends how you said what you said. \n\nId recommend finding a more positive group, good luck op", "YTA for your reaction of lecturing them about what you think is wrong with them. That was indeed rude and out of line. Don't like the group? Fine. Don't want to be a part of it? Fine. Smile, nod and be polite, and go on your merry way. Whatever YOU think of the group is YOUR issue, not theirs.\n\nThat being said, that doesn't sound like a support group to me. Support can include venting, but it also ought to offer experience, strength and hope. It should be a group of people facing a similar issue offering empathy and ideas. This wasn't that, and I wouldn't be back, either.", "YTA. You were an AH to those mothers. They have far more experience than you do so it\u2019s likely you haven\u2019t reached the point that they are at yet. That being said, it was for venting. Nothing toxic about it.

Set a calendar reminder for yourself 1 year from now and re-read this post. \n\nI'm sure you aren't the first or last to be absolutely shocked by the realities and experiences of others who are raising an ASD kid.

Furthermore you should have been a little more kind I know you think your husband is great but your kid just got diagnosed, will you come back next year and tell us if you are still together?\n\nThey are trying to tell you reality, even kids that don\u2019t have behavioral issues often cause a relationship to break. My best friend was with her kids dad for 10 years before they had a baby he didn\u2019t last two years, he raised three other daughters who lived with them so he wasn\u2019t a deadbeat. That kid broke their relationship though. Obviously it\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault it was a different parenting styles and different values and all of that that came to a head once there was this new responsibility and stressor in the relationship.  Nobody is BLAMING their kid they\u2019re IDENTIFYING the situation that caused the end of their marriage.\n\nWho are you to even question that and tell them they are wrong?

You are right it is NOT normalized to hate your child in any form.", "I think nta, \n\nI get if it was a venting group, they stil should have a room for the kids to play separately.

To feel safe sharing.  You were very judging.\n* There should have been a moderator (doesn't sound like one was there) that stepped in as soon as the other group members began projecting their experiences onto you.  There should be no \"you will feel like this.  you will have this bad thing happen to you\".  That is very toxic and unhealthy. There should only be sharing \"I felt this.  I had this happen to me\".  Sharing the \"I\" stuff is healthy venting.  Projecting the \"you\" stuff is unhealthy and toxic.  The group dynamic was absolutely horrible and out of control.\n* The therapist slightly sucks because he should have been aware of how badly that group was run and he clearly wasn't.  I don't think he would recommend it if he knew what it was actually like.\n\nIdeally in a support group each person can share their own personal experiences and sometimes another person can chime in and explain how they overcame a similar experience.  There should never be a sentence like \"there will be days you absolutely hate your child\" directed at a new member, but people should be allowed to say \"some days I absolutely hate my child\".\n\nI hope that you can give support groups a second shot because they can be very helpful but you should find out if its moderated before going.

They also eventually become a sanctuary you can rely on for comfort.\n\nEdit:  Also, we had a teacher in school that wanted a meeting with us and another school official.

Even the so called therapists said so.\n\nYes a toxic one. \n\nAnd you are 100% correct: you cannot blame your child for having a condition that was determined by the genes You provided. (No you can\u2019t blame a adopted child either) \n\nWhen you chose to have a child you Chose a child with Every possible disease and disability there is. If you aren\u2019t prepared to deal with that: don\u2019t have kids. Or at the very least go to every check up and ultrasound and make informed decisions based on the quality of life for the Child not just you.\n\nAlso like to point out that Any therapists that doesn\u2019t automatically include Both parents isn\u2019t worth the money they are charging.\n\nYou have a special needs child you want Everyone on deck and read in on the battle plans.", "NTA. Those poor kids. That specialist should not be sending anyone to that group", "NTA.\nI have been kicked off parenting forums for speaking out about the horrible way parents talk about their autistic kids, especially in front of them.\nIf you want to learn about autism there are alot of autistic people active on social media (avoid Temple Grandin) who will give you excellent insight into how to support your child.", "NTA\n\nA child that's neglected will have lower performances, there's no denying that.\n\nIt sounds more of a support group for \"bad parents\" rather than problematic children.", "ESH. Obviously they shouldn't have been saying those thing *in front of* the kids, but I swear I misread the age and school level they were going into. I almost thought it was 5 months and daycare because you still sound like your in the \"honeymoon phase\" (for lack of a better term) of parenthood. Have you never been frustrated with your kid? Just want them to go to bed or internally mother-fucking them after they've spilled the 15th bowl of cereal that month?\n\nI just... don't believe anyone has that amount of patience.", "I definitely don't think he's a good fit for my family. We've never had any issues with our son until he entered the brand new environment of school, and so far it seems his 504 plan is fixing those problems.", "I'm not necessarily disagreeing with your perspective and I definitely understand why you're saying what you're saying! I just wanted to take the time to point out that one of the best things of group therapy is seeing and hearing others who feel the same way you do. It can be a really awful feeling to have resentment for your child, but hearing other moms have the same feelin can make a huge difference as well. \n\nI'm pro individual therapy for literally everyone tho haha I think both forms of therapy could benefit these moms!", "Not at all but if it's your first day in a support group that no one told you how those operate in a clinical setting or what the purpose is to them, how are OPs comments and behavior going to effect positive changes of behavior of the other adults in regards to their kids?", "God everything is child abuse these days", "This one x", "Why are they saying it in front of the kids, though?", "No, never, this was the first time. This wasn't group therapy. There was no therapist present, nor any sort of moderator.", "I don\u2019t think she was trying to lecture. I think it was more of an aghast reaction to their talking. More for herself than them. She wasn\u2019t trying to change them.", "Not in front of the kids.

I don't see any reason why he should suddenly drastically change for the worse on his sixth birthday.", "Seriously, there\u2019s a personality issue with someone who is brand new to a situation who goes into a support group when they\u2019ve never ever attended a support group and feels like they have the authority to tell everyone they are doing it wrong.\n\nI also think it\u2019s kind of funny that she got mad her therapist suggested a support group for Mom\u2019s but didn\u2019t say anything about the dad when the dad isn\u2019t the therapists client. Also the therapist is a man so it\u2019s very possible he thinks the mom is the only one who has to worry about this because she\u2019s the one who does all the work. I guess I just don\u2019t understand why she would be mad that a male therapist who works for her would make suggestions for her and not for her husband", "We don't know that there's not, only that the specialist didn't recommend one--but a lot of these things are put together by just random people of their own volition, so maybe there just aren't any fathers in the area who decided to start one.", "Yeah, we're a big routine family. My husband loves schedules. It's so great, because he never forgets anything or loses track of time. I used to worry that we would become *that* boring couple that picks up the same grocery order every Wednesday morning and walks to church at the same time to sit in the same pew every Sunday, but being that boring couple is great! Surprises are overrated. It's so good for our son. He always knows what is about to happen, and it soothes him.", "Yeah.. school presents a whole new host of challenges.\n\nIf your child has sensory issues, then the lights are too bright, the hallways are too long, there's too *many* sounds.\n\nThey have to deal with entirely new routines, rules, disciplinary systems...\n\nIt's... a lot. \n\nMost children on the spectrum end up with a whole host of new problems when they first start school, so that's \"normal\".\n\nI'm glad your 504 seems to be addressing the issues!\n\nI'd definitely look for a new specialist, though, if you're already uncomfortable. I needed to meet with a few people before finding the right fit for our family.\n\nNow that you *do* have a 504, you should be in contact with the school psychologist, social worker, or sped coordinator... some sort of point person. I'd suggest talking to them about finding a new specialist. Usually there's someone who they work with frequently, and that pre-established working relationship can be a great thing for continuity of care. Plus it helps when there's forms needed, because both sides already know what you're talking about when you can't remember the name for \"some sort of form the school wants about Phy Ed something or other!\" lol.\n\nI'd start by asking them if they have any recommendations!", "I feel like there's a difference with this group though. A lot of group therapy is talking about how you feel in a way where you can get support back. This was everyone telling the \"new girl\" that her life is changing for the worse, her kid will likely suck, and her husband will turn into a dead-beat-dad. Theres such a big difference between saying \"sometimes I just feel like I hate my kid\" and then everyone going into the topic with the idea that the kid still has value and is loved despite difficulties, and \"i hate my kid\" and a harsh glance at the kid that is currently in the room.", "Yeah I agree I think that a lot of people end up having serious postpartum because society tells them that it\u2019s supposed to be this glorious wonderful thing when they have this new screaming baby in their house in there just supposed to love it so much and it\u2019s all wonderful, except that it\u2019s not so they feel like it\u2019s something wrong with them and it just makes everything worse.\n\nToxic positivity is called toxic for a reason. Pretending everything is just fine when it isn\u2019t will cause serious mental distress for people", "It's not OP's job to fix these people.

I can't think of anything more hurtful for a parent to say to their child. If my mother said \"you're a bitch\" I would be hurt but get over it. If she said she hated me? That would devastate me. And I'm 29, not a small child dependent on her love and care.", "Because single moms with no support also need a support group.", "This is what I figured but I wanted to know for sure. Support groups don't need moderation or a leader, they are there specifically for folks to emotionally vent and to commune with others over what you all have in common because a sense community is important when faced with unique challenges. I think that before anyone joins a group there aught to be a FAQ sheet about what to expect and I think that might have mitigated your AH behavior. That's all on person who recommended the group to you tbh. You came in like a Dunning Kruger and judged these women harshly with very little knowledge. I fully support your POV about how it's weird that Dads were not there in the name of the group, and about kids with tablets and the awful comments in front of their children but it was a huge AH move to walk in and act superior to folks. You are all equals in a group setting like this. EDIT: Are there zero clinicians or therapists in this thread?", "So you\u2019ve never been to a support group in your life, your kid just got diagnosed, but you felt you had the authority to go in there and tell them they\u2019re all doing it wrong? Lol have you been diagnosed with a personality disorder by any chance?", "Then he's a deadbeat too", "He was the specialist the school recommended. I think I want to find someone unaffiliated with the school. I'd like to keep my son's schooling and his medical care separate, and only overlap them when essential. Maybe that won't work out, but we'll see.\n\nSo far it has been good with the 504. My son is a very slow eater, so now he can continue to eat at his desk during the lesson instead of having to put his food away and being upset later about being hungry. The teacher now understands that just because he isn't looking at her doesn't mean he isn't paying attention to the lesson. When he is struggling with a group activity, there are solo activities now that he can do instead. It's really great.", "Thats a very true point! Groups are more like advice/support/empathy as opposed to negativity and \"your life is worse now.\"", "I absolutely did not say that it was acceptable for them to do that. I did not say it would not distress or harm the child.", "So they'll just blame the kids for everything? Is that really a judgment here?", "Then why can't they do something like band together to get a sitter for the duration of their support group session?", "No, I haven't, thank you for inquiring.", "You sound like you\u2019re projecting. \n\nShe was shocked that these women were saying negative these things with the kids in the room. I think most people would be! \n\nIt sounds as though she hasn\u2019t experienced the parenting challenges that these women have and for the specialist to recommend this group was highly inappropriate. Not the fault of OP! \n\nWhy did these women think it was okay to tell her that her marriage will fail and she will hate her kid? They didn\u2019t ask anything about her situation and just tried to drag her into their perspective. \n\nI don\u2019t think this is a normal way to introduce someone new to the group.

Well, lol, don't do that then :P\n\nIf there's an autism network near you, they might have reccs on the website?\n\n>So far it has been good with the 504.\n\nI'm really glad it's working out for you! A lot of times there's a learning curve with these, so it's always good to hear when it goes well from the start.\n\nJust remember that new problems will crop up, and you can request a meeting/amendment at any time. You don't have to wait for the next year!\n\nI'm glad your kiddo is doing well, and it sounds like you're doing a great job. Don't let those other mamas scare you! <3", "[deleted]", "No.  It's trying to keep an open mind and understanding not everyone is as well off as you are.\n\nI guess I am just not willing to make judgements based on a 3rd hand biased account of the situation that a single mother of a child is going through as I hadn't walked in those shoes.", "Or even take turns *being* the sitter while the rest of the group has their session.", "Because sitters cost money.\n\nIt's like when people complain about parents who are looking at their phones when the kid is at a playground.  You don't have enough context to judge.\n\nOr at least i feel like i don't have enough context to immediately make any sort of judgement on a single mom with a child with disability.", "lol you are way too extreme.", "Yes!", "I suspect the group as a whole could raise enough for sitters for their little sessions. Also it isn't just a single mothers group. It was a mothers group. It seems like it is a mothers group that has become soured due to some bad fathers and immediately tried to convince OP that her husband would suck too. \n\nAlso maybe if they didn't exclude fathers from their support group they'd open their world view a bit and see that there are good dads out there too...", "That's why I said band together. It could be prohibitive for one of them to hire a specialized sitter all on her own, but to me that's part of what a support group could do for people.", "I don't read it as excluding father's or attacking them though I can see how it can be read that way.\n\nShe isn't in similar situation and it's not the support group for her.  I would assume support group are like therapists.  It's not one size fits all and you need to find the one that fits you.", "I can understand you thinking it's as easy as that, but sitters are expensive.  A sitter for specialized needs would be more so.  A sitter for a group of specialized would seem to be particularly hard to come by.\n\nThis isn't a hire a neighborhood high schooler situation.\n\nI am not saying you are wrong.  I am saying there is too much unknown for me to come down on them."]}
