I tend to be irritatingly patient with my kid. I had a \"friend\" from a mom's group once tell me to \"stop being so okay with everything! it makes me look bad, and I'm doing my best too!\"\n\nBut sometimes, that's an *effort*. Sometimes it's a mask. You will at some point, get tired of feeling like you're talking to yourself. Like you've tried literally everything, and no one has a solution. There are days... where maybe you don't \"hate\" your child, but... unless you've been specifically taught how to process those emotions, you can't think of another way to describe how you feel. \n\nIt's not \"normal\" to hate your child. But it's also not normal for your child to be 4 years old for 27 years and still kick and bite you. And some moms are dealing with that. \n\nI don't think I've ever \"hated\" my child. But there have been times when I've wondered if I was up for the challenge. If maybe I wasn't enough to handle it. And there have been other times when I *have* wanted a break. Just one day where my kiddo could \"act normal\". \n\nAnd I say this as someone who is *also* on the spectrum. \n\nI also say this as someone who was *equally* appalled that people could talk about their children this way when my kiddo was first diagnosed.\n\nBut... sometimes parents need a safe place to vent... to say horrible things so that they *don't* say those things to their children.\n\n*I* couldn't be part of a group like that. But I understand that a lot of people need it.\n\nThe thing is, though... your child should never be aware of those feelings. Even if that is the purpose of the group, you're *right*. They shouldn't be saying those things in front of their children. \n\nThe purpose is to \"vent\" *without* harming the children.\n\nIf the children hadn't been there, they wouldn't have been AHs. The fact that the children were there? Oh they absolutely are. \n\nIf the children hadn't been there, you would have been the AH. Speaking in defense of the children who *were* there? I think that puts you solidly into not the AH territory.\n\nAs for the recommendation? I don't think it's appropriate to suggest that sort of group as a first step. I think *most* specialists would/do begin with an informational support group. \n\nThis sort of \"drop them in the deep end so they know what to expect\" thinking is rarely beneficial.

Also, those moms need individual therapy to help with their resentment issues. The group sessions sounds more like gossip groups.", "Everyone saying YTA is clearly disregarding the fact that the parents are saying these things in earshot of their children along with the fact that what they were saying generally has a lot of very sexist undertones that I feel nobody was paying any mind to.

It might have been kinder for you not to say anything, but it wasn't kind of them to say such scary things to you either and unload on you like that when they don't know you and you just received a diagnosis. You just don't do that to a newcomer in any group. A good support group will offer you information, guidance, support, comradery, and friendship. \n\nI agree with other posters. Get a second opinion and find another group. A friend of mine belongs to one that is as close as family with spouses and aunts/uncles attending for support. They do family activities, and nights out where a few stay home to babysit, playdates, and even help prepare for and attend the school meeting with each other for support.

Group therapy is so helpful for one another, but it seems that the negativity and hopelessness has gotten to a lot of these moms in a way where it could be unhealthy. Venting about children and raising a kid with autism is something that is so valid. Of course there are going to be difficulties and days where you feel like you may hate your kid, or don't get enough help, and venting about it in a group setting with others who can relate may help a lot. The difference here though, is that they decided to unload this at you, someone who's new and doesn't have much time to process the ASD diagnosis, and tell you that everything is going to become awful. Thats setting you up to resent your kid. And to say all this in front of their child who is currently there? Its awful to me as well. The point of group therapy is to air out your issues, but to also do it in a way that is supportive and sets you up for success. This seems like a spiral of negativity. Instead of pilin all this on, it should have been a conversation where you are engaged. Questions like \"How do you feel?\" Or \"Have you had tough days yet?\" Or even \"For me, days can get so stressful and I need to be alone. Here's what I do to cope and relax so I don't get overwhelmed.\" It should be 1) a GROUp conversation, not them talking at you, 2) a private conversation without the children there (if they're going to talk about them that way), and 3) built in a way where it makes people feel safe, uplifted, and encouraged.", "NTA.\n\nI feel bad for the children present that heard such terrible remarks from their mothers. If you want to vent, vent, but not in front of the children! If you can't make a meeting without bringing your kid... Keep your mouth shut, exchange numbers, and then call and vent once the kid is asleep!\n\nWtf is wrong with those women. Just because they have children with autism doesn't mean those children don't understand what's being said directly in front of them!", "NTA, but I'm not prepared to call mothers in desperately difficult situations who are just trying to get through their day AHs, either. If I have to pass judgment here, it'd be on whoever is supposed to be in charge of this meeting who doesn't have some kind of organized playgroup in a separate space to keep the kids occupied so that the mothers can vent and interact with one another without the risk of their kids overhearing anything potentially hurtful or upsetting.", "NTA sounds like those women really shouldn't have had their kids along. Besides that, they apparently wanted to use you for validation. They should have let you get the feel of the place while they got a sense of where you are in this process. They're burned out for sure, but it's made them far too insensitive to their children and to you.", "NTA\n\nOnly because they were saying these things in plain earshot of their children. \n\nThat tells me more about those mothers than anything else.  They don't care about their children. If they did, they wouldn't say such things in their presence.  Doesn't matter if they don't think they know what's being said. \n\nImagine if it was a support group for mothers of deaf children, and they said such things while their children were present and looking at tablets? Is that OK?\n\nOr if a mother vents in the presence of her sleeping child with cancer. That's fine too? \n\nWould you vent out loud to someone about your SO/family/friends while they are present, saying things like you hate them and blame them for your misery?  No? Well why not?\n\nVenting can be beneficial.  Venting in the presence of the apparent source of said frustration is rude at best, abusive at worst.", "Oof\u2026I understand venting can be healthy but idk this is tough. I wanna say NAH because you didn\u2019t sign up for a \u2018venting\u2019 based support group. What you wanted was advice and if you can\u2019t relate to how they\u2019re feeling then the support group wouldn\u2019t have worked out.", "Gentle YTA\n\nI am sorry you had this experience. I also have great compassion for you and all the other parents and caregivers of children with ASD because I worked with this population and obviously this diagnosis, no matter how much you love your child, adds stress and difficulty to the process of raising them. Obviously it was not appropriate for the mom to say what she did in earshot of her child, but I am not going to judge her because I can only imagine what the rest of her day looked like. I think that perhaps she may have not chosen her words well, but the sentiment of \"I hate my child\" might have been trying to convey how deeply frustrated she was with the situation. Especially for families with children on the spectrum who are non-verbal and have more severe behavior issues, it is very difficult and there is little respite or support for them outside of the school day.\n\nAs for the comments about spouses and marriage... I would extend these mothers some grace. I'm sure you're already aware of the statistic that 80% of marriages with an autistic child end in divorce. I would not call someone's husband a deadbeat, nor would I blame it on the child. It's just the sad reality that this diagnosis puts a LOT of stress on the entire family. I think venting to others who understand what you are going through (isolation is a huge problem for caregivers) can be helpful, but I'm sorry this group didn't work out for you.", "YTA for passing judgment in a support group. This group is probably the only space these women have to express their thoughts and feelings about their situations. I'm sure they don't actually hate their children, but many humans used embellished language when describing stress. \n\nYou don't have to return if it's not your vibe, but your little lecture was not cool.", "INFO: Have you ever been in a support group before this one? When he gave you the information about attending, did he inform you about how group therapy/support works?", "I would have done the same. Disgusting behavior from those mothers.\n\nNTA.", "Severe autism can absolutely be really hard for parents and caregivers to handle, and having an autistic child contributed to my sister in laws divorce. I doubt those women actually hate their children, and yeah, it probably wasn\u2019t your place to lecture them all for not speaking about their experiences the way you would like YTA", "Touchy topic. Im not going to even remotely pretend I know what its like be in this situation, I dont even have any children, so im not in a position to be judging the others.\n\nTo you, however, I dont think your the A. My opinion? That wouldnt be a good group to be around, negative atmosphere will sink into you over time. You probably could have done without blowing up, but then it depends how you said what you said. \n\nId recommend finding a more positive group, good luck op", "YTA for your reaction of lecturing them about what you think is wrong with them. That was indeed rude and out of line. Don't like the group? Fine. Don't want to be a part of it? Fine. Smile, nod and be polite, and go on your merry way. Whatever YOU think of the group is YOUR issue, not theirs.\n\nThat being said, that doesn't sound like a support group to me. Support can include venting, but it also ought to offer experience, strength and hope. It should be a group of people facing a similar issue offering empathy and ideas. This wasn't that, and I wouldn't be back, either.", "YTA. You were an AH to those mothers. They have far more experience than you do so it\u2019s likely you haven\u2019t reached the point that they are at yet. That being said, it was for venting. Nothing toxic about it.

Set a calendar reminder for yourself 1 year from now and re-read this post. \n\nI'm sure you aren't the first or last to be absolutely shocked by the realities and experiences of others who are raising an ASD kid.

Furthermore you should have been a little more kind I know you think your husband is great but your kid just got diagnosed, will you come back next year and tell us if you are still together?\n\nThey are trying to tell you reality, even kids that don\u2019t have behavioral issues often cause a relationship to break. My best friend was with her kids dad for 10 years before they had a baby he didn\u2019t last two years, he raised three other daughters who lived with them so he wasn\u2019t a deadbeat. That kid broke their relationship though. Obviously it\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault it was a different parenting styles and different values and all of that that came to a head once there was this new responsibility and stressor in the relationship.  Nobody is BLAMING their kid they\u2019re IDENTIFYING the situation that caused the end of their marriage.\n\nWho are you to even question that and tell them they are wrong?

You are right it is NOT normalized to hate your child in any form.", "I think nta, \n\nI get if it was a venting group, they stil should have a room for the kids to play separately.

To feel safe sharing.  You were very judging.\n* There should have been a moderator (doesn't sound like one was there) that stepped in as soon as the other group members began projecting their experiences onto you.  There should be no \"you will feel like this.  you will have this bad thing happen to you\".  That is very toxic and unhealthy. There should only be sharing \"I felt this.  I had this happen to me\".  Sharing the \"I\" stuff is healthy venting.  Projecting the \"you\" stuff is unhealthy and toxic.  The group dynamic was absolutely horrible and out of control.\n* The therapist slightly sucks because he should have been aware of how badly that group was run and he clearly wasn't.  I don't think he would recommend it if he knew what it was actually like.\n\nIdeally in a support group each person can share their own personal experiences and sometimes another person can chime in and explain how they overcame a similar experience.  There should never be a sentence like \"there will be days you absolutely hate your child\" directed at a new member, but people should be allowed to say \"some days I absolutely hate my child\".\n\nI hope that you can give support groups a second shot because they can be very helpful but you should find out if its moderated before going.

It\u2019s a difficult time when first diagnosed.  You\u2019ll likely blame yourself.  Your husband will likely internally blame himself and then deny that feeling by over rationalizing.

They also eventually become a sanctuary you can rely on for comfort.\n\nEdit:  Also, we had a teacher in school that wanted a meeting with us and another school official.

Too much focus and \"resources\" are focused on the medicalized view of autism and not the social which leads to a lot ableism. \n\nAlso this kind of talk is especially disgusting to me because so many autistic children are murdered by their parents/caregivers and they get away with it since everyone views them as burdens.", "I saw a movie about her once, but it was a while ago and I don't know anything else about her. What's the issue with her?", ">I'm sure you're already aware of the statistic that 80% of marriages with an autistic child end in divorce.\n\n[This is false.](https://www.kennedykrieger.org/stories/interactive-autism-network-ian/whats-truth-about-autism-and-marriage)\n\nAlso, she can be as frustrated as she wants, but directly saying in front of your child that you hate them and blame them for your divorce is not productive, and OP is not the asshole for leaving an environment where children are treated that way.", "I think the bot gets confused if there are two verdicts on a post, might want to break up the one you dont want the bot to use with spaces or \".\" Between letters", "Wow, uh... No, I have never internally called my son a mother-fucker. That would be... odd, I think? I love parenting my son; maybe I'm weird. He's my lil flappy squish! I love going down and trying to see the world through his eyes. Sometimes he gives me mysteries to solve, where I have to figure out what he wants or needs. Those can get frustrating, but that just makes finding the solution more satisfying.\n\nSome of the people I work with don't speak much English. We frequently have communication blunders. I don't think their struggles with English are the problem, nor is my inability to speak their language. It's just an opportunity for us to get to know one another better, to learn each other's patterns and rhythms, so we can communicate other ways, and pick up those really essential phrases. With my son, sometimes I don't understand him, but that's exciting, because it means I get to learn more about him and the person he is becoming.", "> \"a year from now you'll be embarrassed about how arrogant you were. Things will only get harder, and you'll realize what an ass you're being.\"\n\nI am not a parent, but as a neurodivergent person who was diagnosed as a kid ... I find this statement insulting. Diagnosis isn't the tipping point where everything goes downhill from there. Diagnosis is the point where you finally have some answers and solutions. I'm not saying that everything will be easy, but now you have explanations for behaviors you might not have understood before and resources on ways to mitigate stressors and triggers before they become meltdowns. If you go into this diagnosis with the expectation that it will only get harder then it will become a self-fulfilling prophesy. \n\nHave faith in your son that he will find ways to grow and learn and interact with the world. Have patience with your son when he struggles but support him finding the solutions that work for him. I know so many people on the spectrum who are happy, healthy adults with fulfilling lives.", "> one of the best things of group therapy is seeing and hearing others who feel the same way you do. It can be a really awful feeling to have resentment for your child, but hearing other moms have the same feelin can make a huge difference as well.\n\nI absolutely agree. But unless the parent has expressed this need, the assumption that they need this type of group, *over* and *before* other more solution oriented, informational groups, is a bit ... presumptive, at the least.\n\nAnd even if you were going to recommend a group like this, if you're aware it's predominantly for \"venting\", there's an obligation to share that with the parent, before sending them in.\n\nI do think group therapy helps, but usually it's better when it's at least somewhat positive. \n\nThis group sounds kinda negative to me. Though I suppose it's possible OP just caught them all on a *really* bad day...", "I think the key difference is that with group therapy, you usually have a therapist guiding the sessions. It doesn\u2019t sound like anyone was leading or moderating here, and I imagine that can get toxic real fast.", "Didn't know that, edited my comment. Thanks", "It wasn't her therapist, it was her son's specialist. And she didn't get mad or even say anything about it to him. I think y'all are reaching to demonize OP and make parents who openly say in front of their children that they hate their kids and blame them for their divorce seem like angels.", ">That would be... odd, I think?\n\nNah, only thing/one here that's odd is you. Not attacking you or anything, but you seem extra tbh.", "Thank you for all of this balanced information. The good and the not so good. I have a niece and god-daughter on the spectrum, and I'm always looking for things to sound helpful when her mother (my best friend) is looking for support!", "Their advice also doesn't really fit OPs situation - I know it was drawn from their lives, but if OP's son made it to school age without his ASD being diagnosed, or even suspected, that means that he's probably not going to have a form of the disorder so severe that he's going to perpetually rely on his parents for high support. He likely has much lower support needs, such that a fairly simple 504 seems to be helping a lot. All of that is to say that these other mothers may, in addition to being pretty horrific to say such things in front of their children, just be flat out wrong about the challenges she will face and be trying to scare her for no reason other than making themselves feel better.", "A good, well run support group will be more than a venting session.  There\u2019s is some, but there is also information, camaraderie, resources, and understanding.\n\nI have never been part of an ASD support group, but I was a participant and volunteer at one for one for a specific physical chronic health issue for years.", "I mean, if you're someone's mother, and you accuse them of being a motherfucker, that's not even a little odd? I understand that swears are hyperbolic and not meant to mean the literal definition of them, like you aren't actually calling someone a penis when you say they're a dick. However, it still feels off to me. Of course, that's only my own perspective.", "What the hell is wrong with you?", "It\u2019s not even the kids fault for having ASD or any other disability, how can they even blame those innocent kids? You sure can vent about the struggles but blaming your kids? Is that how it\u2019s supposed to be? Those kids didn\u2019t do anything.", "If the husband leaves because they can't handle the child, but would not have left otherwise, is that blaming the child?  No.  Is the child the cause of the breakup?  Yes.\n\nI am only saying that I am personally trying to keep an open mind and prefer not to immediately denigrate.", "OK, would you say it's ok to say that stuff in front of their kids if their kids had a different disability? Let's say their kids all use wheelchairs--would it be OK for the parents to say they hate them in earshot then? I just think being willing to do that shows a fundamental dehumanization of the kids.\n\nIf they can't get a sitter, maybe the hate talk could be an online chat room or something.", "I'm not saying its okay.  I'm saying keep an open mind and compassion for single moms with kids with special needs.", "What about compassion for the kids?"]}
