I tend to be irritatingly patient with my kid. I had a \"friend\" from a mom's group once tell me to \"stop being so okay with everything! it makes me look bad, and I'm doing my best too!\"\n\nBut sometimes, that's an *effort*. Sometimes it's a mask. You will at some point, get tired of feeling like you're talking to yourself. Like you've tried literally everything, and no one has a solution. There are days... where maybe you don't \"hate\" your child, but... unless you've been specifically taught how to process those emotions, you can't think of another way to describe how you feel. \n\nIt's not \"normal\" to hate your child. But it's also not normal for your child to be 4 years old for 27 years and still kick and bite you. And some moms are dealing with that. \n\nI don't think I've ever \"hated\" my child. But there have been times when I've wondered if I was up for the challenge. If maybe I wasn't enough to handle it. And there have been other times when I *have* wanted a break. Just one day where my kiddo could \"act normal\". \n\nAnd I say this as someone who is *also* on the spectrum. \n\nI also say this as someone who was *equally* appalled that people could talk about their children this way when my kiddo was first diagnosed.\n\nBut... sometimes parents need a safe place to vent... to say horrible things so that they *don't* say those things to their children.\n\n*I* couldn't be part of a group like that. But I understand that a lot of people need it.\n\nThe thing is, though... your child should never be aware of those feelings. Even if that is the purpose of the group, you're *right*. They shouldn't be saying those things in front of their children. \n\nThe purpose is to \"vent\" *without* harming the children.\n\nIf the children hadn't been there, they wouldn't have been AHs. The fact that the children were there? Oh they absolutely are. \n\nIf the children hadn't been there, you would have been the AH. Speaking in defense of the children who *were* there? I think that puts you solidly into not the AH territory.\n\nAs for the recommendation? I don't think it's appropriate to suggest that sort of group as a first step. I think *most* specialists would/do begin with an informational support group. \n\nThis sort of \"drop them in the deep end so they know what to expect\" thinking is rarely beneficial.

Also, those moms need individual therapy to help with their resentment issues. The group sessions sounds more like gossip groups.", "Everyone saying Y T A is clearly disregarding the fact that the parents are saying these things in earshot of their children along with the fact that what they were saying generally has a lot of very sexist undertones that I feel nobody was paying any mind to.

It might have been kinder for you not to say anything, but it wasn't kind of them to say such scary things to you either and unload on you like that when they don't know you and you just received a diagnosis. You just don't do that to a newcomer in any group. A good support group will offer you information, guidance, support, comradery, and friendship. \n\nI agree with other posters. Get a second opinion and find another group. A friend of mine belongs to one that is as close as family with spouses and aunts/uncles attending for support. They do family activities, and nights out where a few stay home to babysit, playdates, and even help prepare for and attend the school meeting with each other for support.

Group therapy is so helpful for one another, but it seems that the negativity and hopelessness has gotten to a lot of these moms in a way where it could be unhealthy. Venting about children and raising a kid with autism is something that is so valid. Of course there are going to be difficulties and days where you feel like you may hate your kid, or don't get enough help, and venting about it in a group setting with others who can relate may help a lot. The difference here though, is that they decided to unload this at you, someone who's new and doesn't have much time to process the ASD diagnosis, and tell you that everything is going to become awful. Thats setting you up to resent your kid. And to say all this in front of their child who is currently there? Its awful to me as well. The point of group therapy is to air out your issues, but to also do it in a way that is supportive and sets you up for success. This seems like a spiral of negativity. Instead of pilin all this on, it should have been a conversation where you are engaged. Questions like \"How do you feel?\" Or \"Have you had tough days yet?\" Or even \"For me, days can get so stressful and I need to be alone. Here's what I do to cope and relax so I don't get overwhelmed.\" It should be 1) a GROUp conversation, not them talking at you, 2) a private conversation without the children there (if they're going to talk about them that way), and 3) built in a way where it makes people feel safe, uplifted, and encouraged.", "NTA.\n\nI feel bad for the children present that heard such terrible remarks from their mothers. If you want to vent, vent, but not in front of the children! If you can't make a meeting without bringing your kid... Keep your mouth shut, exchange numbers, and then call and vent once the kid is asleep!\n\nWtf is wrong with those women. Just because they have children with autism doesn't mean those children don't understand what's being said directly in front of them!", "NTA, but I'm not prepared to call mothers in desperately difficult situations who are just trying to get through their day AHs, either. If I have to pass judgment here, it'd be on whoever is supposed to be in charge of this meeting who doesn't have some kind of organized playgroup in a separate space to keep the kids occupied so that the mothers can vent and interact with one another without the risk of their kids overhearing anything potentially hurtful or upsetting.", "NTA sounds like those women really shouldn't have had their kids along. Besides that, they apparently wanted to use you for validation. They should have let you get the feel of the place while they got a sense of where you are in this process. They're burned out for sure, but it's made them far too insensitive to their children and to you.", "NTA\n\nOnly because they were saying these things in plain earshot of their children. \n\nThat tells me more about those mothers than anything else.  They don't care about their children. If they did, they wouldn't say such things in their presence.  Doesn't matter if they don't think they know what's being said. \n\nImagine if it was a support group for mothers of deaf children, and they said such things while their children were present and looking at tablets? Is that OK?\n\nOr if a mother vents in the presence of her sleeping child with cancer. That's fine too? \n\nWould you vent out loud to someone about your SO/family/friends while they are present, saying things like you hate them and blame them for your misery?  No? Well why not?\n\nVenting can be beneficial.  Venting in the presence of the apparent source of said frustration is rude at best, abusive at worst.", "Oof\u2026I understand venting can be healthy but idk this is tough. I wanna say NAH because you didn\u2019t sign up for a \u2018venting\u2019 based support group. What you wanted was advice and if you can\u2019t relate to how they\u2019re feeling then the support group wouldn\u2019t have worked out.", "Gentle YTA\n\nI am sorry you had this experience. I also have great compassion for you and all the other parents and caregivers of children with ASD because I worked with this population and obviously this diagnosis, no matter how much you love your child, adds stress and difficulty to the process of raising them. Obviously it was not appropriate for the mom to say what she did in earshot of her child, but I am not going to judge her because I can only imagine what the rest of her day looked like. I think that perhaps she may have not chosen her words well, but the sentiment of \"I hate my child\" might have been trying to convey how deeply frustrated she was with the situation. Especially for families with children on the spectrum who are non-verbal and have more severe behavior issues, it is very difficult and there is little respite or support for them outside of the school day.\n\nAs for the comments about spouses and marriage... I would extend these mothers some grace. I'm sure you're already aware of the statistic that 80% of marriages with an autistic child end in divorce. I would not call someone's husband a deadbeat, nor would I blame it on the child. It's just the sad reality that this diagnosis puts a LOT of stress on the entire family. I think venting to others who understand what you are going through (isolation is a huge problem for caregivers) can be helpful, but I'm sorry this group didn't work out for you.", "YTA for passing judgment in a support group. This group is probably the only space these women have to express their thoughts and feelings about their situations. I'm sure they don't actually hate their children, but many humans used embellished language when describing stress. \n\nYou don't have to return if it's not your vibe, but your little lecture was not cool.", "INFO: Have you ever been in a support group before this one? When he gave you the information about attending, did he inform you about how group therapy/support works?", "I would have done the same. Disgusting behavior from those mothers.\n\nNTA.", "Severe autism can absolutely be really hard for parents and caregivers to handle, and having an autistic child contributed to my sister in laws divorce. I doubt those women actually hate their children, and yeah, it probably wasn\u2019t your place to lecture them all for not speaking about their experiences the way you would like YTA", "Touchy topic. Im not going to even remotely pretend I know what its like be in this situation, I dont even have any children, so im not in a position to be judging the others.\n\nTo you, however, I dont think your the A. My opinion? That wouldnt be a good group to be around, negative atmosphere will sink into you over time. You probably could have done without blowing up, but then it depends how you said what you said. \n\nId recommend finding a more positive group, good luck op", "YTA for your reaction of lecturing them about what you think is wrong with them. That was indeed rude and out of line. Don't like the group? Fine. Don't want to be a part of it? Fine. Smile, nod and be polite, and go on your merry way. Whatever YOU think of the group is YOUR issue, not theirs.\n\nThat being said, that doesn't sound like a support group to me. Support can include venting, but it also ought to offer experience, strength and hope. It should be a group of people facing a similar issue offering empathy and ideas. This wasn't that, and I wouldn't be back, either.", "YTA. You were an AH to those mothers. They have far more experience than you do so it\u2019s likely you haven\u2019t reached the point that they are at yet. That being said, it was for venting. Nothing toxic about it.

Set a calendar reminder for yourself 1 year from now and re-read this post. \n\nI'm sure you aren't the first or last to be absolutely shocked by the realities and experiences of others who are raising an ASD kid.

Furthermore you should have been a little more kind I know you think your husband is great but your kid just got diagnosed, will you come back next year and tell us if you are still together?\n\nThey are trying to tell you reality, even kids that don\u2019t have behavioral issues often cause a relationship to break. My best friend was with her kids dad for 10 years before they had a baby he didn\u2019t last two years, he raised three other daughters who lived with them so he wasn\u2019t a deadbeat. That kid broke their relationship though. Obviously it\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault it was a different parenting styles and different values and all of that that came to a head once there was this new responsibility and stressor in the relationship.  Nobody is BLAMING their kid they\u2019re IDENTIFYING the situation that caused the end of their marriage.\n\nWho are you to even question that and tell them they are wrong?

You are right it is NOT normalized to hate your child in any form.", "I think nta, \n\nI get if it was a venting group, they stil should have a room for the kids to play separately.

To feel safe sharing.  You were very judging.\n* There should have been a moderator (doesn't sound like one was there) that stepped in as soon as the other group members began projecting their experiences onto you.  There should be no \"you will feel like this.  you will have this bad thing happen to you\".  That is very toxic and unhealthy. There should only be sharing \"I felt this.  I had this happen to me\".  Sharing the \"I\" stuff is healthy venting.  Projecting the \"you\" stuff is unhealthy and toxic.  The group dynamic was absolutely horrible and out of control.\n* The therapist slightly sucks because he should have been aware of how badly that group was run and he clearly wasn't.  I don't think he would recommend it if he knew what it was actually like.\n\nIdeally in a support group each person can share their own personal experiences and sometimes another person can chime in and explain how they overcame a similar experience.  There should never be a sentence like \"there will be days you absolutely hate your child\" directed at a new member, but people should be allowed to say \"some days I absolutely hate my child\".\n\nI hope that you can give support groups a second shot because they can be very helpful but you should find out if its moderated before going.

It\u2019s a difficult time when first diagnosed.  You\u2019ll likely blame yourself.  Your husband will likely internally blame himself and then deny that feeling by over rationalizing.

They also eventually become a sanctuary you can rely on for comfort.\n\nEdit:  Also, we had a teacher in school that wanted a meeting with us and another school official.

If these people openly state they hate their kids in public, imagine what the kids endure in private. \n\nFurther, I would not be shocked to find out that the specialist who recommended this group knew full well about this already.

OP, you just met a flock of Autism Moms and it's good you got the hell out of there and called out both them and the specialist that referred you there because that whole mess is a pile of toxicity.\n\nIs parenting hard? Yes. Is parenting a child with varying levels of special needs hard? Yes. Do marriages fall apart because of the development of disability in one or more of the members of that family? Oh yes, absolutely. (though, statistically speaking, men are waaaay more likely to abandon their partners and families when disabilities occur, so men, do better, seriously) \n\nBut the healthy way to vent about it is to direct your ire at the broader situation, not, in this case, a goddamned innocent child. Those moms were absolutely being toxic asses towards and about their children. And, unfortunately, that's not uncommon among certain kinds of parents to autistic children. You were right to say something about it and leave.\n\nYour child will face difficulties (and the family will too), but acting like an ASD diagnosis is a death knell to normalcy is ridiculous. Saying that you'll hate your child some days is toxic. There will be days that your child will do things that you hate and you'll deeply dislike the situation but you should not be directing your hate *at your child*, especially not so much that the you are comfortable just advertising that you hate your kid somedays. Those two scenarios may seem like the same to some but they *are* different. It absolutely *does* matter to differentiate that kind of thing, mentally. Because the latter leads to resentment buildup directed at the kid. Kids pick up on that shit. Especially when their parent is in the habit of badmouthing them within earshot. There's no way that kids like that grow up well, in an environment like that.\n\nParents should be able to vent their frustrations with parenting, especially when the children they are parenting face more difficult circumstances. But you gotta be careful in how you vent, so you're not adding to resentment and hate. Because at that point, it's not really venting.\n\nOP, I hope you're able to connect to a healthier support group. Maybe look for ones that have input from autistic adults and autistic parents, since they are on the spectrum themselves, they can have different insights into life as an autistic person.

I'll use meltdowns as an example. \n\nMany NTs (Neurotypicals) confuse meltdowns with tantrums. A tantrum is an attention seeking behavior, and is under conscious control.   \nA meltdown is a reaction to overstimulation of some sort, and is not under conscious control. Overstimulation can be caused by just about anything. Myself, I am sensitive tactilely, so I can only wear certain textiles, seams are annoying, and clothing tags are pure evil. (To me, one of those tags in the back of your neck on a shirt feels like a pot scrubber down my shirt) If I am wearing the wrong clothes, and have other stimulus coming at me, I can melt down in an attempt to block out the world until I can regain my center.   \nOverstimulation can be caused by almost anything, depending on the person. I know someone who gets overstimulated if you wear different patterns, or contrasting colours. \n\nWhen your child is screaming, possibly hitting their head, and just \"acting like a terror\" (description of me from before I was diagnosed) in the middle of a restaurant, you MIGHT wind up hating them, briefly, until you remember that it's not their fault, and the people who are judging you are being unfair.", "NTA.

Support groups for people with long time issues can often be like you described, complaining about the day-to-day situation with people who understand them.

The things women are never allowed to say? How hard it is? How the sometimes resent the world?\n\nYou are right that they should not be blaming their kids or talking in front of them, and that their husbands are responsible for their own actions.  so may be I should say e S H.\n\nBut honestly, parents are not always going to be great.  Saying that sometimes you hate your kid means the same thing as when people feel a flash of anger at a relative dying painfully of cancer.  They don't hate their kids. They are trying to cope.

They use autism as a scapegoat for all their problems.   \n\n\nLook, these people are well known, toxic, and just generally ablist and terrible. I'm really happy to see you figured it out without any prompting. All of our work in the autism community to counteract these terrible people isn't going to waste if you \"get it\" that this stuff is wrong.   \n\n\nThere is a bright and wonderful community of autistic people out there, just waiting for you to find us. We don't hate our kids. If we happen to get a divorce, we take adult responsibility for it instead of blaiming our children. We love our neurodivergent kids and we love neurodivergence in ourselves. We understand that this is PART OF WHO YOUR KID IS.   \n\n\n Raising kids is very hard. Raising neurodivergent kids isn't any less hard. There are a few things that are extra challenging. You'll have to deal with ablism from your community. You'll face internalized ablism in yourself. You'll have to soothe your child when they confront ablism in the community. In general, a lot of us autistic folks take more time to mature, and this can be really frustrating for parents who look forward to getting past XXX phase of development.  \n\n\nBut overall, we're still human beings. Kids are still kids. I hope you enjoy (most of) the ride of raising your son.   \n\n\nFor better communities, look for Autism Acceptance and programs that have anti-ablism policies.   \n\n\nA last piece of unsolicited advice: avoid ABA like the plague.

I tell everyone to assume he understands everything you're saying and not to say anything around him that you wouldn't say around a neurotypical kid.", "As an autistic person who's mother felt that she was the biggest victim of my disability I would venture further to say that many of these parents allow \"autism\" to become such a big deal that it overshadows their relationship and ability to engage with their child. Yes autistic people have different brains and needs but we're also still human beings and many of these parents never actually engage with their kid on a human to human level and get to know who they are. So in a sort of twisted logic it makes sense that they would project a singular autistic experience because they don't even view their own children as individuals.\n\nI think it boils down to emotional immaturity, and the kind of parents who would centre themselves in the relationship with a child they chose to bring into the world never make great parents even to neurotypical children. But their ableism and the nature of autism as a disability makes the effect in this particular dynamic exponentially more harmful and damaging to their children.", "They did not say it's ok to hate your child.

(But I would recommend reading Neurotribes before reading Temple Grandin's books.)", "Temple Grandin is an expert in cattle. You should listen to her about cattle. If your kid is a calf, you should listen to her, but other than that, no, she's not a good source for information on parenting.  \n\n\nA lot of people read her books as a way of connecting to an autistic person who is articulate about her own experience.   \n\n\nThat's great, but her latest book is on parenting. And SHE HAS NEVER BEEN A PARENT. NOR HAS SHE HAD EDUCATION IN PARENTING. The book is terrible. Don't listen to Grandin on parenting.   \n\n\nI'm autistic and this is a consensus in the autistic adult world. Honestly, many of us have suspicions that she's being used and manipulated by the people who support her.", "Yeah, autism has become such a huge thing online recently, with all the push back against neuro divergence discrimination, that people refuse to hear about the ugly side of things. I'm glad that more people are becoming aware of autism and that autistic people are more free and find more support, but it shouldn't be at the expense of all the people who can't speak up for themselves.\n\nThe big downside of that is that it usually ends with hating on parents. And I'm not denying that there are many awful parents out there who will treat their neurodivergent children awfully, but there are *also* parents who suffer a lot because of their children.\n\nI've seen so many posts and comments saying that the parents knew the risks when they decided to have children, and yes, sure... to an extent. No parent, when they get pregnant, expects to still be wiping their son's ass 20 years later. It's like telling someone who's been paralysed in a car crash that they can't complain or feel bad because they knew that getting into a car can be risky.\n\nAll the \"Stella, 20, ADHD/autism, she/her\" tumblr bios are fine, but they're not even remotely comparable to the autism I'm used to. In fact, it wasn't until I was around 15 that I learned that many autistic people can like... *talk*, and exist in society without needing help 24/7.\n\nAutism ruins lives from my experience, from the children themselves to their families. It's not everyone's experience, and thank god for that, but many do have to live through similar times.\n\n>I can never say that my brother gave me severe PTSD after trying to kill me multiple times when I was a kid, and that although I love him, I struggle to be around him now as an adult, because... well, that's GOT to just be close-minded discrimination against all autistic people, and not just the occasional reality of severe autism.\n\nThis is horrible, and sad but very true. There's family members, right now, who live in fear of their autistic loved one. I was once called horrible names for saying that yes, I would actually love it if there was a \"cure\" for autism, and my brother would too. He'd get to actually experience life, and not just be basically a 2 year old stuck in the body of a 20 year old.\n\nJust 30 minutes ago I had a scheduled online appointment with a doctor, but my brother was showing signs of throwing a fit, which usually means screaming at the top of his lungs, hitting himself, breaking things, and hitting others. So I had to go outside in the shed at night, to have the appointment, just in case. It's not a big issue by any means, but it's hundreds of little things like that that we have to take into account that others just can't imagine.\n\nI've \"babysat\" a handful of severely autistic children over the years, simply because the parents know that I'm used to them with my brother, and they'd have to hire very special babysitters who ask for a lot of money, and non-verbal violent autistic children can be extremely difficult to deal with, specially when they grow up.\n\nSo yeah, autism isn't just the \"fun and quirky\" autism we see online, or the teenagers struggling with social cues, it can also be children who will bite their mothers to the point of taking off a large chunk of skin, who will break glass and then walk on it barefoot, or who will slap themselves and their heads so much you start to fear for their brain.\n\nFamilies of those children also have the right to complain and vent about their experience.", ">Diagnosis isn't the tipping point where everything goes downhill from there.\n\nAlso neurodivergent. A point I've seen activists make better than I'm going to here is that your life *would* go downhill very quickly after your kid's diagnosis if you joined a support group that told you your kid was a horrible burden with no future.\n\nMy personal advice for parents of neurodivergent children is run, do not walk, to resources created by neurodivergent adults. Cuz there are a lot of mistakes that are very easy to make if you only look at resources created by neurotypical people.", "I am a parent of an autistic daughter.  I have never hated her ever. I have been frustrated before. It isn't easy but I have never felt what those moms were saying. \n\nVenting to me is: My child is on a yellow kick right now and will only eat yellow foods. (I had that conversation once with a mom). So we brainstormed yellow foods.  Turns out cheese covered counted as yellow. \n\n\n\nMy favorite frustrating stage in my house was the \"no clothing\" stage. I was surprised how common that stage was.", "When my son got his IEP, things got easier for both of us.

The truth simply is that a lot of people are barely equipped (whether it's emotionally, physically, financially) to have children let alone handle one with disabilities. Not to mention the reality of having a child with disabilities, severe disabilities or behavioural issues, is very different from what you imagine it will be when you're simply in love with the idea of building a family and a life.", "That's awesome! Yeah, I really appreciate him more the older he gets and the more we are able to just talk about things like adults and share opinions.\n\nI'm pretty sure both my parents are also autistic, but they're undiagnosed, so it wasn't like that for me growing up (but they did treat my weirdness as totally normal, which is nice too).", "You have 1 kid, very young.  Just keep that in mind when judging others.\n\nI have 2 kids, 13 and 10. My 13-year-old is also autistic, but he is what would classify as low support needs. I think that you would be appalled to find that just this week I called him an asshole to his face, now we were trading very sarcastic insults towards each other and laughing, but I definitely called him asshole child when he asked if I was stupid.\n\nEveryone has a different relationship with their child, and that relationship evolves as they grow. When my kids were very little I definitely felt all fuzzy warm lovey dovey should be my interactions with them over everything, similarly to how you are portraying yourself. But now I have a preteen and a teenager, I'm also a Boy Scout leader and Cub Scout leader where I am working daily with youth ages 6 to 18. The interactions evolved and change over time. Now I will say I don't think that I have ever called my children anything awful out of anger or resentment or any ill feelings, but I definitely have hit the point of them fighting where I've told them not to be assholes to each other or stop being jerks and I have very plainly laid out to them how their behaviors impact everyone around them and well they're not responsible for anybody else's feelings, they are absolutely responsible for their own behaviors and how they treat each other and treat everyone else and if they are choosing to be assholes and make everyone around them miserable they should be aware of that because it impacts their future relationships with people when they become adults. They have to know how to have appropriate interactions as adults, and if they are treated like everything they do is just so amazing they will never learn that and that's how you end up with adults who are insufferable at minimum.", "I saw that book being recommended by one of my favorite advocates the other day.", "Autism Speaks is a hate group, so yeah, avoid anything even remotely associated with them", "We have 8 billion people on earth, many of whom successfully raise disabled children.

When I'm dealing with a issue directly caused by them not supporting me, my immediate thought is how irresponsible it was for them to have me knowing the possibility of me being born or becoming disabled (Yes, they knew of some of those genetic issues long before having me) and being unable to support that.

I have ADHD and likely Asperger's too, but the latter has never been formally diagnosed. I have two autistic kids (diagnosed) and the thing I've hated most about the process is meetings with professionals where you're expected to explain all the problems you have with your kids in front of the kids.\n\nThey can't help it if some of their behaviours are problematic and I hate having to say stuff that sounds like I don't like them. I've always tried to have them occupied elsewhere if what I need to say is stuff that would make them feel I was unhappy with them, because however challenging they may be, it's not their fault and I love them both unconditionally.\n\nI appreciate parents need to vent, it can be incredibly hard at times, but it's not the time or the place when the kids are there. I've been in groups where there are parents who think their reality should be the only reality and get very riled up if yours isn't the same.\n\nI feel for those people, but it comes down to the old saying - don't make a 'you' problem into a 'me' problem. If you hate and resent your kids, that's your personal situation and I hope you get help with it, but don't expect me to sit there and collude in slagging off our kids for having neurological challenges.

Some parents will feel like they're parenting a four year old for twenty years or longer, some kids will at some point learn to mask and/or develop coping methods and be able to function independently in society one day. Some mothers here may be struggling with a level of difficulty that OP may never face, and a worry that there is no end to this tunnel. That may be true for them even if it never is for OP.\n\nThat all said, this support group does sound like some Autism Speaks shit to me, and that's not exactly a good sign for whether these parents are just loving parents who are struggling and struggling to express their complex feelings... the fact they think OP is absolutely going to see autism as a nightmare makes me concerned they aren't seeing autistic people as more than autism?", "Ikr?! None of them indicated their kids were hearing impaired. They don't understand how much words can hurt? Please.", "OP sounds like someone who would benefit from resources led or created by autistic adults, but I tend to find that these are mostly for parents whose kids are verbal, in regular classes on school, and largely don\u2019t need much support.

It's not always a bad thing, but most of what you think of when you think \"venting\" is some form of rumination and that will only reinforce the negative emotions. Additionally, despite the long-term harm, you'll feel slightly better in the short term and thereby condition yourself to keep falling down the spiral by venting more.\n\nYou've perhaps heard people defend this kind of rumination as if it were a psychological _need_, letting off pressure, you just had to get it out! Those are misguided excuses based on severely outmoded psychology. A long time ago \"catharsis theory\" supported ruminating and \"getting your feelings out\" but it has since been soundly disproven.\n\n\"Good\" venting is specifically that which helps you to reframe your emotions, introduces new ways of thinking about problems, and which doesn't encourage the audience to experience or relive those same negative emotions - in general it must have _effective feedback_. You must get past the \"letting off steam\" part and make actual progress on the emotional content, or you're only hurting yourself and the people listening.", "This is not true.

It isn't really about whether my kid is like their kid, it is about whether what I am saying makes them uncomfortable. And that's fine, it's an uncomfortable thing and teasing out this stuff in a setting of social norms and expectations that don't really support autistic people is hard and doesn't happen all at once. But the vitriol that happens because \"hey, every kid deserves compassion and respect\" challenges the martyr complex that some parents of autistic kids have is real and is why most other autistic parents I know steer well clear of these kinds of support groups. They usually aren't safe for autistic adults, which is kinda weird when you remember that autistic kids grow up into autistic adults (and that a fair chunk of those parents at those meetings are probably undiagnosed autistics themselves, because genetics). We're both too autistic to have a valid opinion, and not autistic enough to have a valid opinion ;)", "They also didn't mention there's a licensed therapist among them, so it still wouldn't be considered a group therapy session, just a support group. A group therapy session generally has at least one licensed therapist among them so that it doesn't turn into what these moms seem to have going, which is a weird negative echo chamber where they focus only on the negatives of their kids being diagnosed. I mean. I'm all for group therapy, but that's not what this is, its a support group, and as someone with ASD myself, it seems to me they're throwing themselves headlong into the autism mom \"My kid is SO HARD and dealing with them is SO MUCH and sometimes I just HATE THEM and WISH THEY DIDN'T EXIST\" mindset you see mothers of autistic kids get online sometimes and seem keen on getting OP into it.\n\nDefinitely NTA, OP.", "There's no medication for ASD specifically. \n\nASD is not a catch all diagnosis.

I knew well before the official diagnosis that he had ADHD. It had been very clear to me for quite a while. It had also been very clear to his pediatrician, but our hands were tied until he was old enough for an official dx, since he juuuust barely missed qualifying for services through birth to 3. \n\nMore information gives you a *much* better ability to develop coping mechanisms. An official diagnosis opens up access to *so* many services through school systems to accommodate their individual needs and issues. I am in such a better place with my son now than I was when he was diagnosed, and he's doing so much better. \n\nThat statement sounds like it came from someone who got their kid's diagnosis and promptly gave up on them because they had an official problem now. I know that this is likely a *very* different process for parents of ASD children with high needs than it was for me with my kid that's just got garden variety (albeit with severe hyperactivity) ADHD. I'm sure it's very much more difficult and more painful.

But giving the mother the benefit of the doubt here, she probably doesn't hate her kid - she's just so frustrated that some days she gets that feeling for a few seconds and would never tell anyone else about those feelings, except for this venting group.\n\nI understand how parents can get so frustrated that they end up thinking things that is awful. When my daughter was an infant, the first couple of months she was screaming almost every night, sometimes for 5-6 hours at a time. I remember my husband saying things to me during that time, that I think are horrible (like \"I wish we had never had her\" and \"If I had been a single parent, I would have given her up for adoption\"). He was frustrated and sleep deprived (and has probably forgotten all about saying those things now). Luckily things were only really hard for a few months. But if this mother has been feeling like this for years, while not having any help and being a single parent - she might be drowning in all of this, which is tragic, really, and the system should provide for much more help to avoid caregivers being pushed like that.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong and she's an asshole who doesn't care about her kid's feelings. I don't know. I'm just saying that even if these things are horrible to say, it may just come from a place of deep frustration.

This comment section really shows how some Redditors think of autistic kids: if moms were saying absolutely abhorrent things in front of their non-autistic children, everyone would agree how inappropriate this is and how it can possibly cause trauma for the child. No child wants and needs to hear that his or her mom hates them sometimes or that their existence ruined their marriage. It's completely okay for the moms to vent, but not on front of their children. It's honestly worrying how they're so okay with saying things like that in front of their children - even if non-speaking, they might understand them and carry it with themselves (maybe if these moms listened to autistic people, they would know that there are a lot of autistics who never spoke a single word or speak only sometimes, but understand what people around them are saying). \n\nAnd honestly, it's good for them to not to be only in an echo chamber and maybe hear out the fact that for example a deadbeat father isn't a child's fault. It's really easy to blame the child - they're sometimes difficult to deal with, have meltdowns, shutdowns... so why not blame everything that goes wrong... I've been surprised that sometimes certain moms don't even know how regular children are in terms of development and blame it all on autism, just because their only experience is with an autistic child(ren).\n\nI'm autistic and my partner is too. He was diagnosed as a kid and his mom (who doesn't sound nearly as bad as these moms) said a good few insensitive things in front of him when he was a kid. He carries it with himself to this day, it's part of why he's so traumatized. He thinks his family's life would be better if he was never born, if he never existed. These moms are likely unintentionally working on their kids being anxious, traumatized and/or depressed on top of the autism. \n\nParenting in general is exhausting and parenting a disabled child brings a whole new set of challenges. It's okay to need time for yourself, it's okay to want to scream into a pillow, it's okay to have a support group, a therapist, vent to close friends... it's not okay to say these things in front of your children: it makes me worry what else they do and say in front of their children.

Group therapy has a moderator specifically so shit like this doesn't happen.", "Honestly when someone doesn't talk sometimes people say the craziest shit though, it's like they forget there's someone else in the room.   \n\n\nI had this friend in high school who wasn't on the spectrum, he was just quiet. Dude knew SO many secrets because people would forget he was there and talk about shit they wouldn't have talked about if they had stopped to realize he was still there listening.", "As someone that grew up with autism I dont recommend keeping medical care and schooling seperate as any good school will want to work with the specialist anyway. If you keep it separate that's a barrier to the education of your child its difficult enough as it is to get professionals to talk to each other.", "I teach autistic kids, and the school environment is the problem, not the kids. They just have different needs and think differently than neurotypical kids. One of my favorite places to learn from adult autistics is a page on Facebook called Neurodivergent Rebel", "It\u2019s good the strategies you put in place are working.\n\nAs your son grows older he may outgrow the strategies that work for him and you should expect that there will be some upheaval until you find what works again. That\u2019s normal. It\u2019s also normal that you and also your son may get pretty frustrated during those times. Mine was when puberty hit as \u2018every time I get the hang of it and think I\u2019m getting somewhere the goal posts change and I again can\u2019t meet their (school) expectations because I\u2019m older now and should have learned to handle this\u2019. It\u2019s difficult when they develop self-loathing due to being aware of their challenges. We changed to a school that was willing to work with us rather than making his life harder.\n\nMy kid is through puberty now and we\u2019ve got things mostly squared up now but some times can be quite hard.\n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing by finding a specialist that you feel is right for your family. Trust your gut. Try and build up a good support network for yourself so you can get a break as well because you need to also look after yourself. And there will be times when you feel overwhelmed so the support you get is very important because carer burnout has a habit of sneaking up on you.\n\nI wish you and your family all the best.", "Remember that autism is a spectrum.   \n\n\nOne of my friends was almost killed by her middle schooler because he was bigger than her and he got violent when things triggered him. He literally put her in a coma.   \n\n\nI'm not saying she hates him sometimes, because I don't know if she does or doesn't. I am saying that if someone is hitting and punching you on the regular it would be a natural emotional response to feel hatred toward them in the moment no matter how much you normally love them and no matter how much you didn't want to have that reaction.   \n\n\nI'm happy and grateful for you that you haven't had those kinds of experiences with your daughter, but please don't judge those who have.", "This is such an Autism Speaks thing. \n\nThose people do so much harm.", "Plus, it's not like a kid suddenly fundamentally changes the second they get a diagnosis. If these women weren't experiencing any issues with hating their children or their husbands being deadbeats before, then the fact that they had those problems after diagnosis means that these women and their husbands are just ableist. \n\nI'd bet that these women are all self identified Autism Moms, mother's of autistic children who make their child's neurodivergence all about themselves and focus on painting themselves as the victims of the Horrible Child Stealing Boogeyman Autism (TM) rather than learning how best to support their children.", "I think it's pretty safe to say that saying you hate your kid while your kid is in earshot is not good or helpful behavior no matter what the group was like otherwise.   \n\n\nVent all you want, but don't do it where the kid can hear.", "And neither autism nor a peanut allergy nor even cancer justifies blaming your young child *who is sitting right next to you* for everything going wrong in your life.", "I understand it's not the same, but just like autism, you can't control when and which kid end up with it. \n\nAlso cancer is majorly different then autism. You can't cure autism, you can at the very least treat cancer. \n\nI empathize with parents who are struggling to try and support every need a child with autism needs, I can't empathize with a parent who grossly infantilizes their autistic children, blame them for THEIR issues (divorce, financial issues etc) the child didn't do shit but exist and all I can say to parents who seem to think that their children are to blame is cope. It's one thing if you do your utmost best to raise the child and still (within reason) struggle to care for them, it's a whole other game if you put the bare minimum of effort, complain your children are such a burden to you and low-key hate them for existing. \n\nLast thing: I'm autistic too, it's not that I don't have empathy for parents of disabled children it's just I have a hard time pitying them when they chose to have children, and have the audacity to complain it's the kid's fault. I've also seen/experienced parents being SUPER ableist under the guise of wanting a \"normal\" kid. It's gross and downright cruel to do that to your kids. Besides that, tone isn't something I'm great (because of the aforementioned autism)", "I could literally go on for hours about autism speaks. The way they frame they're \"PSA\" videos as autism being quite literally as bad as *AIDS* is so genuinely terrifying as a autistic person. It really solidifies the fact that I will never be accepted by general society in a major scale. At *best* I can expect minor accomodations and pity, never treatment as a equal who simply has different needs", "Interesting username.", "This.   \n\n\nIt's one thing to have parenthood go a lot harder than you expected, and to need to vent about that sometimes.   \n\n\nIt's another to make it the kid's fault and talk shit in front of them.", "Hard agree, and to a certain degree I wouldn't feel comfortable with any parents coming to me with that. It feels very icky for parents to *hate* their children, in front of them or no. If they're truely feeling like that then that's a sign they need to put their children into care (hopefully temporarily) while they receive serious help. If my sister expressed this sort of sentiment about any of my Niblings, I'd be concerned about her doing something to her kids. Hating your kids is NOT normal in any situation and feeling like that way is something the kids will 100% pick up on", "But that's still reasons \"other than the kids\", who this group decided to blame instead."]}
