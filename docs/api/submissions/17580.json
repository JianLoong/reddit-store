This means you get to invite two people, no exceptions, I called to confirm that. My son and his girlfriend have been together for three years, she's a year older so she already graduated.\n\nMy son had a talk with me last week. He explained that since he's only able to have two people, and he'd like his girlfriend to attend, that he just wants her and my husband to be there. He claims that he picked randomly which of us would have to stay home, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nI told him that while I'll respect his decision and obviously I can't force him to change it, I'm dissappointed. I explained that while this was his moment, it's something I want to be there for. I told him I felt it was a little silly to have his high school girlfriend come over one of his parents.\n\nHe got angry at that, and said I wasn't taking his relationship seriously, he ended the conversation after that. My husband understands my frustration and even offered to switch with me, but I don't want him to miss it either. He thinks I should've just let it go and not argued it.", "created_utc": 1684438813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l8nvk/aita_for_telling_my_son_im_dissappointed_that_he/", "score": 6084, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps the same attitude your husband has towards this altercation (don't make it a big deal, don't communicate your feelings and be honest about things make you feel to keep the peace, etc) are why he chose Dad over You.

I can't imagine the hurt you are feeling.  Could he have maybe invited both of his parents to the ceremony and have her meet yall for a celebratory dinner before or after?  Or dump yall directly after the ceremony to spend time with her to celebrate alone with her?  There's a lot of options besides having your mom miss one of the biggest days of your life.  You are entitled to your hurt feelings.  It is ok to let someone know they have hurt you.  It doesn't make you a bad person,  an asshole or someone who doesn't take his relationship serious because you have feelings about something.", "NTA. OP is the mother, and apparently not a bad one or the kid and his dad would have been united and said why.\nThe kid apparently feels that all his decisions should be 100% fully supported and if a parent doesn't agree then the kid should be allowed to snap at the parent.\nThat's not how being an adult works.", "NTA I would also take this as a big slap in the face. High school graduation is the transition from childhood to adulthood in a lot of ways; it is a time for parents to feel pride in their children, and children to express gratitude to their parents. I'm really sorry that you're going through this. I hope he'll come to his senses. If not, he's probably going to feel really bad about this when he looks back on it in the future.", "NTA and this is really weird. I get a limit of some sort  but 2 people seems very unrealistic. Think of the number of people whose parents divorced and remarried. Seems like this is just ripe for causing conflict and hurt feelings like OP is dealing with. \nThe only suggestions I would have is to call the school and see if there is anything that could be done or ask around and see if anyone has a ticket they are not using.", "NTA is this his high school graduation or his college/university graduation? If it\u2019s his high school graduation, are you planning on helping him pay for his college?

I would gently remind him that you are the one who helped him with his first words, his first attempts at writing, with his homework, running him around to his extra curricular activities which I\u2019m sure you helped pay for. Going to his graduation is your reward for all the support that you have offered him over the years.", "NTA. Your son is an ungrateful little shit.", "NTA.  Your son has some serious life lessons to learn.  How self centered can you be-given your husbands reaction it\u2019s clear where he got it from.

At last minute they said they could but without any confirmation. \n\nSo my gf passed the invitations to me and the dad of a mutual friend, who helped us a lot during our time on university.\n\nI stayed outside the building as long as I could, waiting for her parents to arrive (ready with a book in hand if I had to wait the whole thing). As I talked to the guards, they were really nice and undertanding, so they offered to keep an eye for me (if the parents got lost and the cameras showed them in other entry) and offered me a chair to be comfortable.\n \nHer parents didnt arrive. The guard at the main door of the auditorium called me when they started giving the diplomas (yes, I got everyone on the mission xD) so he let me enter to cheer my girl. Wasnt the best outcome but at least she got to be cheered for people she cared about.", "assuming there are no glaring issues in the relationship, I can understand why you would be hurt by this and how your son is being unfair to you. however, I hesitate to make that assumption and this is based only on your flippant comment about his relationship. *you* understand that nearly all high school relationships fizzle out and how rare it is that high school sweethearts get married. *I* understand that. a lot of people in this thread understand that. but I need you to think back to when you were his age. when every relationship in your mind was your 'greatest love' and how deeply emotional and passionate a time that was for you and so many other teens. in his mind, this is his *soulmate* and we all chuckle a little about that, considering their ages, and because we know what we know now as adults. but it is important to treat these things with the same amount of gravitas that your son does because that's just how adolescent brains work. he does not yet have his fully developed adult brain which, I must emphasize, is not an insinuation that he is somehow dumber or less capable than a grown adult. what is actually means is that the majority of all of his decisions will be made by the amygdala, which is a structure in the brain that is driven by pure emotion. the prefrontal cortex will be fully developed later at around twenty five years of age, give or take. this will aid him in thinking more critically and reacting less rashly. have you ever made comments in the past about his relationship that may have downplayed it? this could be in response to how you treat his decisions and choices. he might not feel supported by you. you might make him feel silly and stupid for believing the things he does. I know that that likely isn't your intention but it could be what's happening. just something to consider. with so little information about your relationship dynamic, I do not feel comfortable making any judgment calls on whether or not you are the asshole. approach him with an open mind and heart. remember that you were there once too. best wishes", "I don't think you're TA for feeling disappointed.

Given the fact that they have been together 3 years give their relationship meaning.\n\nI also say this I never dismiss my sons gf. Because one day they may be a random gf later on they could be a future daughter in law. Comments like op made hurts any future relationship. One day of this gf marries op son she will remember this comment. And if they do get married have kids op is going to wonder why her mom gets to have more access during pregnancy, delivery and the first few weeks. I can answer that it will be because op never excepted the relationship gf and son had. No wonder she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with you now. Because why would she be comfortable when you labeled their relation as her as the random high school gf.\n\nNo wonder so many daughter in laws hate their mil. Because the mil treated them like this from the beginning but when they realized they where marring their son they suddenly cared about them.\nIf you want to start off right with a future daughter in law.

If we are taking OP at face value, she doesn\u2019t mention any relationship conflicts with her son though.

Not everyone at this age understands nuance and they tend to hurt their parents for a while. \n\nOP did react in a good way.

OP, you may have a husband problem. Your husband may be the reason your son disrespects you....\n\nI really hope your son changes his mind.  I would advise you to watch that husband a little closer.

He did my homework all through elementary and junior high (middle) school, said I was incapable of doing it myself (his way of saying I was stupid without saying I was stupid). I don't mean he helped, I mean he DID it. Answered all the assignment questions, read all the assigned chapters and took notes on them; I never got the chance to do any of that as he took my backpack with him to his work area the moment we got home. When I \"studied\" for tests, we used his notes. I did...alright. Got A's, mostly B's, a few C's sprinkled here and there. I put my foot down in high school and told him I was doing my homework on my own because I wanted to be prepared for college, and there was no way he was going to do my homework when I went (or be able to, as the university I did go to was 2 1/2 hours away). He flat out said that I would fail if I did it myself. I told him I would rather fail doing it myself than to continue allowing him to coddle me. That was a very painful summer, and first few months of freshmen year. Well, joke was on him. Mostly A's, with one or two B's every year. I graduated 7th out of 84 in my class. Never let him do my homework once. I had never been more proud of myself. After the ceremony, and I joined my family for pictures, my dad hugged me, then put his arm around my shoulder and shouted \"WE did it!!!\" to my family.

He had no idea why my mom and I were upset. When I collected myself mentally, I said \"No, *I* did it. You weren't up there with me.\" Strangely, that broke the tension and my family laughed.

They have been married 9yrs and have 3 kids.", "I\u2019m talking about most of what I\u2019ve seen, not everyone or all situations. Even some I\u2019ve seen are awesome, but most I\u2019ve seen are not.", "Yeah, my MIL does this, but behind closed doors, she is a monster. I don\u2019t know OP, but I can say from personal experience that you really never know.", "god that's rough, I'm sorry you had to go through that for so long. I'm glad you're able to live your own life now \u2764\ufe0f & I get you.  both my parents have cancer at the moment and while I hope they go gently and don't suffer more than they have to, honestly a big part of me keeps thinking of how free I will feel when they are dead (specifically my mom, because she's the one I have a relationship with. Ive been NC with my dad for years now). anyway sometimes I feel like if anyone heard my internal monologue without context they would think I'm a monster and people keep telling me family is the most important thing there is, etc etc, but damn. I will be so liberated, and I feel no guilt thinking that.", "You think 59% of high school relationships last? More than half? That\u2019s what being \u201con par\u201d would mean. It\u2019s probably more like 1% of high school relationships that last, and that\u2019s being generous lol", "Relationships. They are using divorce rates as a supporting statistic as there isnt a reliable statistic to show how many dates the average person would go on or how many breakups without marriage the average person has.\n\nIve been in 5 serious relationships at multiple ages. never been married, but the most compatible one was probably when I was in high school. Their whole point is that its just as likely things dont pan out regardless of age.", "3yr relationships, yea. Most high school relationships don\u2019t last 3yrs so the ones that do, are on par.", "I know a lot of people with relationships out of high school lasting 6 years or longer. Not a single one is still together now that we're in our 30s. One of them did get married, but they got divorced in less than a year. Of course this is anecdotal, but unless you have something to back your claim I call bs."]}
