This means you get to invite two people, no exceptions, I called to confirm that. My son and his girlfriend have been together for three years, she's a year older so she already graduated.\n\nMy son had a talk with me last week. He explained that since he's only able to have two people, and he'd like his girlfriend to attend, that he just wants her and my husband to be there. He claims that he picked randomly which of us would have to stay home, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nI told him that while I'll respect his decision and obviously I can't force him to change it, I'm dissappointed. I explained that while this was his moment, it's something I want to be there for. I told him I felt it was a little silly to have his high school girlfriend come over one of his parents.\n\nHe got angry at that, and said I wasn't taking his relationship seriously, he ended the conversation after that. My husband understands my frustration and even offered to switch with me, but I don't want him to miss it either. He thinks I should've just let it go and not argued it.", "created_utc": 1684438813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l8nvk/aita_for_telling_my_son_im_dissappointed_that_he/", "score": 1503, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps the same attitude your husband has towards this altercation (don't make it a big deal, don't communicate your feelings and be honest about things make you feel to keep the peace, etc) are why he chose Dad over You.

I can't imagine the hurt you are feeling.  Could he have maybe invited both of his parents to the ceremony and have her meet yall for a celebratory dinner before or after?  Or dump yall directly after the ceremony to spend time with her to celebrate alone with her?  There's a lot of options besides having your mom miss one of the biggest days of your life.  You are entitled to your hurt feelings.  It is ok to let someone know they have hurt you.  It doesn't make you a bad person,  an asshole or someone who doesn't take his relationship serious because you have feelings about something.", "NTA. OP is the mother, and apparently not a bad one or the kid and his dad would have been united and said why.\nThe kid apparently feels that all his decisions should be 100% fully supported and if a parent doesn't agree then the kid should be allowed to snap at the parent.\nThat's not how being an adult works.", "NTA I would also take this as a big slap in the face. High school graduation is the transition from childhood to adulthood in a lot of ways; it is a time for parents to feel pride in their children, and children to express gratitude to their parents. I'm really sorry that you're going through this. I hope he'll come to his senses. If not, he's probably going to feel really bad about this when he looks back on it in the future.", "NTA and this is really weird. I get a limit of some sort  but 2 people seems very unrealistic. Think of the number of people whose parents divorced and remarried. Seems like this is just ripe for causing conflict and hurt feelings like OP is dealing with. \nThe only suggestions I would have is to call the school and see if there is anything that could be done or ask around and see if anyone has a ticket they are not using.", "NTA is this his high school graduation or his college/university graduation? If it\u2019s his high school graduation, are you planning on helping him pay for his college?

I would gently remind him that you are the one who helped him with his first words, his first attempts at writing, with his homework, running him around to his extra curricular activities which I\u2019m sure you helped pay for. Going to his graduation is your reward for all the support that you have offered him over the years.", "NTA. Your son is an ungrateful little shit.", "NTA.  Your son has some serious life lessons to learn.  How self centered can you be-given your husbands reaction it\u2019s clear where he got it from.

At last minute they said they could but without any confirmation. \n\nSo my gf passed the invitations to me and the dad of a mutual friend, who helped us a lot during our time on university.\n\nI stayed outside the building as long as I could, waiting for her parents to arrive (ready with a book in hand if I had to wait the whole thing). As I talked to the guards, they were really nice and undertanding, so they offered to keep an eye for me (if the parents got lost and the cameras showed them in other entry) and offered me a chair to be comfortable.\n \nHer parents didnt arrive. The guard at the main door of the auditorium called me when they started giving the diplomas (yes, I got everyone on the mission xD) so he let me enter to cheer my girl. Wasnt the best outcome but at least she got to be cheered for people she cared about.", "assuming there are no glaring issues in the relationship, I can understand why you would be hurt by this and how your son is being unfair to you. however, I hesitate to make that assumption and this is based only on your flippant comment about his relationship. *you* understand that nearly all high school relationships fizzle out and how rare it is that high school sweethearts get married. *I* understand that. a lot of people in this thread understand that. but I need you to think back to when you were his age. when every relationship in your mind was your 'greatest love' and how deeply emotional and passionate a time that was for you and so many other teens. in his mind, this is his *soulmate* and we all chuckle a little about that, considering their ages, and because we know what we know now as adults. but it is important to treat these things with the same amount of gravitas that your son does because that's just how adolescent brains work. he does not yet have his fully developed adult brain which, I must emphasize, is not an insinuation that he is somehow dumber or less capable than a grown adult. what is actually means is that the majority of all of his decisions will be made by the amygdala, which is a structure in the brain that is driven by pure emotion. the prefrontal cortex will be fully developed later at around twenty five years of age, give or take. this will aid him in thinking more critically and reacting less rashly. have you ever made comments in the past about his relationship that may have downplayed it? this could be in response to how you treat his decisions and choices. he might not feel supported by you. you might make him feel silly and stupid for believing the things he does. I know that that likely isn't your intention but it could be what's happening. just something to consider. with so little information about your relationship dynamic, I do not feel comfortable making any judgment calls on whether or not you are the asshole. approach him with an open mind and heart. remember that you were there once too. best wishes", "I don't think you're TA for feeling disappointed.

His anger suggests maybe there are deeper feelings and this wasn\u2019t really random choice. Maybe you have things to reflect on and address.\n\n I do know that most parents I know would not be happy at all if their child chose their girlfriend or boyfriend and excluded them from their high school graduation.

I married my high school bf. That was 30 years ago. It\u2019s rare but it does happen. Given the fact that they have been together 3 years give their relationship meaning.\n\nI also say this I never dismiss my sons gf. Because one day they may be a random gf later on they could be a future daughter in law. Comments like op made hurts any future relationship. One day of this gf marries op son she will remember this comment. And if they do get married have kids op is going to wonder why her mom gets to have more access during pregnancy, delivery and the first few weeks. I can answer that it will be because op never excepted the relationship gf and son had. No wonder she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with you now. Because why would she be comfortable when you labeled their relation as her as the random high school gf.\n\nNo wonder so many daughter in laws hate their mil. Because the mil treated them like this from the beginning but when they realized they where marring their son they suddenly cared about them.\nIf you want to start off right with a future daughter in law. Treat every girl your son brings home with respect.

Maybe that\u2019s dysfunctional, but I know that I would rather not be around for fear of what I might say to someone, and I\u2019d definitely need some cool off time to forgive.

Her son is gonna feel like shit that he did this eventually but that\u2019s cold comfort for his mother.", "And asking her to grovel and apologise for nothing lol.\n\nIt's on him to grow up and apologise. I'm not saying she should hold a grudge, but she did nothing wrong and apologising just because he had a temper tantrum will teach him all the wrong lessons.", "Spend the rest of his life explaining?

Your way guarantees this kid goes no contact.", "Lol.", "You really don\u2019t think it\u2019s silly (or at least short-sighted) to choose your *girlfriend* over your *mom* to attend your *high school* graduation?

She\u2019s allowed to tell him her opinion that it\u2019s a silly choice.", "I wonder what would happen if OP did take the dad's place. She said that she was uncertain that he chose at random.

It is High School.  The circumstances matter and are different.", "It's more NTA here. They raised him, yes, and they also made sure he stayed alive to see this point in time. The kid doesn't have a specific reasoning for wanting his partner there over his mother. If she was overbearing or abusive, then I'd understand.

If they break up later, he will have nothing but regret", "oh yes of course the strangers who presumably raised him, paid for his school, supported him throughout his academic journey, and made him the person who he is today is less of a priority, right? The argument that it is his own graduation can be made all day but it still doesn't change the fact that he chose a gf over his parent.", "Very fair! If we are taking OP at face value, she doesn\u2019t mention any relationship conflicts with her son though. But as we know, not all parents are perfect at owning up to suffering relationships. \n\nBut yes, if their relationship is in anyway strained I would change my verdict.", ">So I know there can be plenty of reasons why the son feels his gf earned that spot over his mother.\n\nBefore jumping to conclusions, we should look at his age. Maybe the son is just being an immature kid who thinks being in love means he has to always put his grilfriend first. Not everyone at this age understands nuance and they tend to hurt their parents for a while. \n\nOP did react in a good way. She told him it hurts but she didn't try to change his mind, which indicates that she is a good parent.

The 19yo probably still has a bunch of friends graduating.", "I'm not close to my parents. I invited them to my graduation anyway, because everyone was bringing their parents. It made it painfully obvious why I'm not close to them and my biggest regret is inviting them. When I graduate with my Master's, the only person I'm inviting is my boyfriend.\n\nNot everyone has great parents. OP not believing her son chose at random whether it will be her husband or her to go shows that there are issues in the relationship.\n\nI say NAH - OP's son can choose who comes and OP can feel slighted, neither makes them wrong", "Uh. Yeah. You are. I don't know how else to phrase that for you lol", "No one said he's legally required to invite her, but he's still a total asshole for the ingratitude.", "What about telling his decision is silly. \n\nIs it really \"good parenting\" to basically say. Well, I'll respect your decision, but just know it's stupid. \n\nSo yes when someone says your choice is \"silly\" their trying to nudge or manipulate you into doing what you consider the \"smart\" choice.", "Here's why I consider it manipulation. \n\nShe's saying him taking his girlfriend is a silly decision, and the smart and right decision is to invite her. \n\nShe is essentially saying you can do what you want but just understand your current decision is stupid.\n\nYou're focusing only on the disappointment statement skipping over her insulting his decision.", "This is the probable answer. Teens make seriously flawed decisions for better or worse. This is a situation where mom should push the issue. I can almost guarantee that son will look back on this situation 15 or 20 years later and be like, \u201cwhat the hell was I thinking?\u201d", "I don't know anyone who did invite a boyfriend/girlfriend to a high school graduation.", ">but would dad feel the same sleighted way if he wasn\u2019t invited?\n\nAlmost certainly not, because in the story he basically shrugged at the whole situation and offered to swap.\n\n>which is exactly the reason I don\u2019t include my mom in my life as much as she ironically wishes she was. Because she acts needy, and that\u2019s extremely uncomfortable.\n\nYou're just proving her point -- that she wasn't invited for a reason, and that it wasn't just a random coin-toss or whatever.", "No kids, but was the child of the type of parent who wants to be recognized all the time for my achievements. \n\nYour kid doesn't owe you recognition for the things you were required by law to do (getting them to school).", "I do. I have 2. one of which graduated from high school not long ago and if for some reason they asked me to not attend the ceremony I would have accepted it because I know there would be people taking pictures and videos and I'd get to spend the rest of the day with them. Or even a different day. It's ok to be upset a little bit but there will be far more important events that happen after high school. OPs kiddo won't even be with the people watching the ceremony so it isn't something you celebrate with your kid. The celebrations and really fun stuff is the party or dinner after so you can actually see your child and talk to them.\nIt's not a lot. It is literally the bare minimum. Food, clothes, education is what people should be doing without praise.", "I think you're just struggling to see any POV other than parents that have always been loving and supportive, and thats just not the reality for everyone and it also can't be assumed of the OPs family dynamic.\nIt doesn't change the fact that if OP continues to make her son feel like he isn't delivering her what is owed, it will continue to push him away.", "OP isn't referencing a graduation party. You should read it through again.", "Can't the same be said that you can't assume all families are \"normal.\" Frankly, I think it makes little difference. Even adequate and good parents shouldn't hold parenthood over their child's heads. Thats going to inevitably build resentment.", "By the sounds of it, 99 different people in highschool did", "How is he the asshole? I didn\u2019t invite EITHER of my parents to my graduation OR my baptism and I have a good relationship with both of them. I simply just didn\u2019t want them there and chose others over them instead. They were perfectly fine with it. Again just because you\u2019re a parent doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll always trump over others. If he wants his high school girlfriend to go then he wants highschool girlfriend to go. it doesn\u2019t matter if they \u201clast\u201d he still wants her there. NAH", "It's not manipulative it's quite upfront. It's very clearly saying that you think the choice they made is wrong.", "Of course a parent should tell you when your decision is silly? That\u2019s their job, to teach you how to make good choices in your life. It\u2019s literally their job to nudge you into what they consider a smart choice, what do you think they\u2019re meant to do?", ">She's saying him taking his girlfriend is a silly decision, and the smart and right decision is to invite her. \n\nBecause it is. For everyone, not just OP. As a parent you have to sometimes say \"I love you, I respect your decision but just know it's a dumb decision\".\n\nWhat kind of a parent are you if you always act as if everything the child does is the right thing?", "She made a mistake downplaying his relationship and calling his decision silly (not the same as stupid), but it's still not manipulation. She's stating her opinion outright.", "Well the reason she wasn\u2019t invited for likely wasn\u2019t listed in the post, good day sir.", "Judging by your responses up and down this thread, you also have difficulty understanding anyone else\u2019s point of view. It\u2019s awful that your parents weren\u2019t what you needed them to be. But refusing to acknowledge the valid perspective of others because of your own trauma is not productive.", "It isn't \"owed\" but is rather expected. Parents can't be selfless 100% of the time, they would definitely want to be a part of their child's major milestone.", "The ceremony is usually followed by a party within the school premise itself. Don't know if it might be different for others.", "I would not assume all families are normal. But then I didn\u2019t make a blanket statement, you did. And while I agree good parents shouldn\u2019t hold parenthood over their children\u2019s heads, I do think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for good parents to expect to be included in major milestones.  It would be selfish for children to exclude loving, nontoxic parents from important events like graduation or weddings just because they felt like inviting other people. You don\u2019t get another high school graduation. Making your mother miss out on that without a better reason than \u201cI wanted to invite my gf\u201d is selfish and incredibly hurtful to your mother.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe OP is a toxic parent and there are some missing reasons here, that could be true. I don\u2019t take issue with any individual person not inviting parents for personal reasons. I took issue with your proposition that it\u2019s toxic for parents to expect anything at all ever from their children.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m sorry for my tone. I\u2019m having a rough day. I shouldn\u2019t have been sarcastic.", "And there are plenty of things that the parents *wanted* that they went without to support their child. Gratitude doesn't just mean paying legally binding debts and then saying \"i don't wanna!!!\" any time it comes to showing appreciation for anything you aren't forced to at gun-point.\n\nIf he had any gratitude towards his mother for putting him through high school and raising him from diapers, he wouldn't have said \"lol soz flipped a coin so you're gonna have to sit out one of the biggest pay-offs a parent gets so my gf who isn't even graduating can... uh... be proud I graduated a year after her\". Actually, by all accounts there wasn't even a \"lol soz\". He doesn't even have that level of basic empathy.", "That depends doesn't it? \n\nIf OP was this amazing mom always there for her son than yes it's being upfront. \n\nBut what if she's wasn't so great of a mom. Maybe abusive maybe emotionally unavailable.  If that's the case it's her trying to manipulate and not be upfront. \n\nThat's my point. It depends on who says it.  It could be good parenting it could also be manipulative.", "But how do you know inviting her was the \"right thing\"  \n\nMy comment was based off you saying, the mom showed she's a good mom by what she said. \n\nI'm saying that line proved nothing. Because she could be saying your decision is dumb and for all we know she's abusive to him.  \n\nRemember this started with me saying not all parents are deserving of a seat at graduation. We don't know how this person was raised so it is possible she's being manipulative also possible she's a good mom. \n\nBut we weren't there he was. I'm just saying not all parents are good parents. Just because she said I respect your decision doesn't really prove she's a good mom", "telling someone their decision is stupid is an incredible way to get them to not change their mind and do what you want. just because you feel something is a true statement doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be said, and it obviously didn\u2019t help or she wouldn\u2019t be asking reddit. as for \u201cwhat kind of parent\u201d, i\u2019d say the kind of parent who doesn\u2019t get invited to their kid\u2019s graduation.", "That's fair. My intention was to add a perspective that I didn't find much through reading other comments. And I do believe that this is going to be a recurring issue as OPs son continues into adulthood. My experience is that many friends and family members share an experience while moving into young adulthood and becoming adult children, where the parents feel that they are owed services because of what they gave their children growing up. And in my experience, the only path that will lead to is resentment. That experience isn't something that can be blanketed across all young adults and adult children, but it also isn't exclusive to me.", "Oh really? My father didn't even bother to show up to mine and I had to practically beg my mother to show up. Not everyone has good or even decent parents dude.", "But dismissing his relationship with his girlfriend because he should owe this to his mom is the issue. I think its completely reasonable for her to say, 'I'm hurt and I would've like to be included, but I understand this is your decision and a hard one to make. Let's figure out how to compromise over this tough situation and figure out how we can all celebrate as a family (or something).' That's reasonable. But to throw shade at his girlfriend and act like this is something she's entitled to is an issue.\n\nI think it boils down to tone and intention. They should have a sit down and really talk through their feelings together.", "I\u2019m curious what this has to do with this post? Like OP clearly does want to be included and we are talking about whether she\u2019s entitled to feel that way. I\u2019m sorry you had crappy parents who didn\u2019t care to be included in your life, that really sucks. But also that doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with this post or the discussion here.", "My parents didn't show up either, they didn't give a shit. But OP clearly does care, and wants to attend. Different situation.", "There are exceptions to everything and of course what I said is based on assumptions. It will be a never ending cycle if we try to consider every possbility bro.", "I wasnt replying to the op tho was I? I was replying to someone else's comment.", "I wasnt replying to op. I was replying to a very specific comment rhat said \"parents would definitely want to be there for their child's major milestones\". I was pointing out that that isn't always the case.", "That is not what you said, though. You said they would definitely want to be there, which isn't true."]}
