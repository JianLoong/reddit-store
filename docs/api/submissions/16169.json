As written, that opinion makes a lot of sense. Knowing at 16 weeks versus knowing at 21 weeks doesn't change too much in the grand scheme of things, and that $100 could be spent on getting the gender-agnostic things for the baby (crib, baby monitor, etc.) or go toward your down payment.", "I'd like to say NTA because you are not blocking the decision.\n\nI'd like to say YTA because if someone is going to push the equivalent of a bowling ball out of their bottom and what they want leading up to it is to spend a hundred bucks I think they ought to be welcome to do so.", "NTA\n\nYou are having a third child, trying to save for a house, and living on a single income; I'd agree that $100 to possibly find out the gender 5 weeks sooner is entirely unnecessary.\n\nBut the pregnancy brain wants what the pregnancy brain wants. \n\nUnless $100 will break the bank, if she goes through with this, let it slide.", "INFO\u2026 just to clarify: if she makes the appointment you would not prevent her being able to pay for it, correct?\n\nBecause you WOULD be the AH if you\u2019re saying that you wouldn\u2019t ALLOW her to do it if she wanted to. Using money to control her and to make her feel as if she can\u2019t go do as she chooses without your permission is financial abuse.\n\nIf you share your money equally and you don\u2019t use it to control her, then she doesn\u2019t NEED your approval.

Is she really wanting your child to be a specific sex or something? I can totally understand the curiosity thing, but spending $100 for something you can find out in a few weeks anyways is definitely wasteful. Plus, the earlier on in gestation, the higher the chances of an inaccurate determination. And like you said, they may not be able to determine the sex at all anyways. \n\nYour biggest concern as parents should be the overall health of the baby.

I think its just not worth the fight and she probably just feels a stronger connection to the baby at this phase and is heavily invested in learning about it", "YTA. Wow. It sounds like you don\u2019t care about her feelings. Even if it\u2019s not a big deal to you, it\u2019s a momentous event for most moms-to-be to find out the sex of the baby! A joyous moment! And you just shit all over it. From the way you describe things, it sounds like you believe you are in charge and that you can decide what to allow her to do. You are not her owner and you don\u2019t get to decide what is important to her. You should be embarrassed. Treat this woman with more respect.", "YTA - is your wife an adult?

She could even use those 100$ to create a gender reveal surprise for you both. \n\nIt\u2019s not a need, it\u2019s a want. Nothing is going to happen if she waits another 5 weeks.", "NAH. I agree this is an extra appointment that's not needed but in the larger context unless you're in immediate need of $100 this is probably a battle not worth fighting.

Personally, I waited until the 20 week ultrasound, when they are checking to make sure baby's got all of the right development going on, before thinking about the gender. Here's the thing-- you don't have to 'approve' of it because she's doing it anyway and is an adult. I wish you'd made a better argument for us, though. I mean, is the $100 going to mean missing meals or having to stretch money, or is it just the principle? I don't like wasting money either, however, I'm not living in your wife's body and I know I was a bit irrational more than once during my pregnancy. So, if she's fixated on this, maybe understand that when she gets her answer, she can focus on other things. It may also be that this is something that gives her a sense of knowing or control about the pregnancy-- when your body is doing that work of growing a baby, the hormones plus demands of your other children-- it may be a gift to her.", "NTA but for the sake of not upsetting her pay the 100$", "Side note: I think you should use this tactic one day like say fishing season doesn't start for another 5 weeks, so you're going to need to drive to another state where it starts sooner to get some fishing in, and when she tells you that's insane and you can wait just throw a fit and say you're gonna do it anyway whether she likes it or not \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.

I think it would be more similar to pushing a bowling ball out of your penis maybe, but ass was fine, the point was made well.", "I\u2019m having my first this summer and also did the genetic testing just for peace of mind. Found out pretty early it\u2019s a boy, then cracked up hard at our anatomy scan when he full-on mooned the tech with a perfect view of the goods \ud83e\udd23 She laughed and said \u201cAyup, that is absolutely a boy!\u201d", "I\u2019m in Australia.  Most healthcare is subsidised by the government.  I\u2019m not going to move over something like this \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Not everyone needs the NIPT.

To waste it when the woman can wait 5 weeks, The baby is either a boy or girl. Peace of mind would be needing to get test results to see if there is an abnormality. not the gender of the baby.
