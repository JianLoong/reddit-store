My (25M) younger sister (22F) has a golden retriever, ill call him Lucky, who she got four years ago when she moved out of our parents house. I always thought it was dumb for her to have a dog when she was so young and her life wasn\u2019t figured out and she was working as a barista, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. I\u2019m more of a cat person but Lucky is sweet and I would occasionally dog sit for her, she would bring him to family gatherings, he sorta feels like part of the family now, etc.\n\nBut, after a 2-year long distance relationship my sister is now engaged to a guy who lives halfway across the country, and she\u2019s planning to move in with him after the wedding next year. Apparently his apartment building where he lives long term doesn\u2019t allow dogs, and so she\u2019s planning on leaving Lucky behind, and wants me to take him. I like the dog but I live in a cramped apartment with my girlfriend and neither of us want to take on that responsibility. I basically feel like it\u2019s on her to figure it out with her fiancee, but she\u2019s been guilt-tripping me about wanting to keep Lucky \u201cin the family\u201d and saying I\u2019m being heartless, etc.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy for me to not want her to offload the responsibility that SHE CHOSE onto me, especially because in general her whole life she\u2019s been the less responsible one and this is a perfect example of that.

I'm assuming she got the dog as a puppy.  Regardless, you don't want a dog, your GF doesn't want it, and a big dog in a small apartment makes no sense.  You're NTA and it's your sister's problem, not yours.", "NTA\n\nIf she *asked* if you wanted Lucky and was disappointed when you said \"No\"?  Then she'd be fine.  But to guilt-trip you and *pressure* you into taking her dog?  No.  \n\nThis isn't your problem to solve.", "NTA\n\nShe's the AH. I could never imagine leaving my cats behind. I'd either choose my cats over my relationship or I'd find somewhere nearby to my partner to live that would allow me to keep my pets.", "NTA\n\nShe's being a major asshole. In the family my ass. She clearly doesn't care all that much.", "NTA. She sounds very selfish and self centered. She also doesn\u2019t sound like she loves the dog as much as she claims. You don\u2019t walk away from your dog - you find a place to live that accepts dogs. I feel so bad for the dog. It\u2019s horrible for the dog, they love unconditionally and bond with people it\u2019s very hard on them when they are abandoned by their primary owners. She doesn\u2019t deserve to have pets. I understand you don\u2019t want to take the dog, and there is nothing wrong with that decision. She is causing this poor sweet dog serious grief.  Shame on her.", "Why don\u2019t she and the boyfriend find a pet friendly apartment?", "NTA. She committed to a dog, not you. She needs to re-home poor Lucky if she no longer wants that sweet boy.", "NTA. Your sister has some nerve guilt tripping you when this is entirely on her. She\u2019s the one who got a dog when she wasn\u2019t at a stable place in life. She is the one choosing to move away, and move into a place that doesn\u2019t allow dogs. She could move to a different apartment, one that is dog-friendly. She\u2019s the one who decided against that and decided to give her dog away instead.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t care about keeping the dog in her family, why should you? It\u2019s her damn dog.\n\nDon\u2019t take him. The only reason she wants you to is so she can feel better about her decision to abandon her dog\u2014to tell herself that she\u2019s not abandoning him, since he\u2019s still \u201cwith family.\u201d", "NTA. At all. The responsibility of a dog, especially one that\u2019s only two years old, AND a big dog at that, is not on you. YOU didn\u2019t get a dog. That\u2018s a at least 10 year commitment. When you want to go somewhere, you\u2019re the one who has to find a dog sitter. Or kennel the, pay the vet bills, etc. The responsibility is on THEM  and they are totally laying their guilt on you.  If they love Lucky that much, they\u2019ll find something for him, and if not, that is NOT on you. Your sister shouldn\u2019t have taken him to begin with.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYour sister is a crappy pet owner.\n\nI wonder why she is putting this on you instead of your parents? Like did they already tell her no guilt free and she knows you are a pushover?\n\nShe and her fiance have plenty of time to find a new home where they can have dogs. The fact that she's not even considering that makes my blood boil. You can't bail out every pet she does this to, because she will try to do this to you multiple times for the rest of her life.\n\n\\[ I speak from experience. I am the pushover animal loving older sibling. \\]", "NTA and while it's sad for Lucky, he is not your dog and not your responsibility. Maybe help her find a loving family who wants a sweet pet.", "NTA. Do NOT take the dog. Shes trying to manipulate you, and lashing out because the lil princess isnt getting her way as she commanded....... Am a dog person, no real pet lover would dump their animal for some AH they met online.", "NTA. Your sister is a bad person and manipulative with it. Can you take Lucky and find him a good home? Not for your sister's sake, for Lucky's.", "NTA\n\nA dog is a commitment for the whole LIFE of the dog. This can be anywhere from 8-18 years depending on the breed, assuming you get a puppy/very young dog.\n\nShe should be planning a future with Lucky if she wants to keep him. It sounds like she doesn't want to deal with the hassle of perhaps moving to another place with her then husband, even though it sounds like this is still at least 3 months into the future if not over a year (I don't know when this wedding is). In that time they could be looking for a pet-friendly place, but apparently Lucky doesn't mean that much to your sister. Why should YOU take Lucky in when it isn't your dog, you live in a cramped apartment, you don't want the dog and neither does your partner whom you live with.\n\nYour sister needs to either makes accommodations in her life so that she can keep Lucky, or shut up about keeping the dog in the family and offer him up for adoption to people who do want to make space in their life for a dog.", "NTA the dog is hers, her responsibility - not yours.", "NTA, but she is. That dog is her family and she made a commitment to take care of it for all its life.", "Her fiancee ought to take a long hard look at what she's doing to her dog. Anyone that would abandon their dog for a partner is not someone I'd want to be with. Just my 2 cents worth. NTA.", "NTA, and probably not a good idea to consider doing favors for people like her.", "NTA\n\nShe can get a dog friendly apartment. Her call.", "NTA. I\u2019m kind of worried about your sister just marrying someone she\u2019s only had a long distance relationship with and moving so far away.", "Urgh!  She adopted the dog and make a lifetime commitment to it.  She and her husband need to find an apartment that is suitable for her dependent.   Jesus CHRIST, seriously,  it is infuriating that people seem to think that a pet can be given up when it becomes inconvenient.   FFS, if you are not in a stable situation and not ready to commit to a pet for its lifetime, you do not get a pet!  This is the height of selfishness and cruelty.  Sis is TA.

I seriously weighed the options. But the animal import fees, 2 week quarantine in a separate country, 27+ hours of travel, and the entire lifestyle change in the destination country would have been wildly unfair to her and detrimental to her health. \n\nInstead, she\u2019s with her Grammy and Grampy (my mum and step dad) and their lab who\u2019s her best friend of all time. She goes for nightly drives and walks to the lake, has her own seat on their boat, huge house and yard to roam, and has my self employed mum home with her all day. I cry all the time cause I miss her so much, but she would have hated life in a 4 room flat with no garden to speak of, while my husband and I work full time. \n\nHad my husband been located in the same country, or on the same continent, she would have come with me, no doubt.

I couldn\u2019t bear the idea of leaving my pets behind.

My dog\u2019s former parents had filed to adopt a child in another country.

Possibly from even a puppy mill.

Idk?", "A backyard breeder is not neccesarily unethical. I've met a few that get one unrelated male and female, breed them a couple times, and then call it.", "yeah, the unfortunate reality is the dog hasnt been enough of a prioirty for either of them to justify him moving apartments. i put the blame more on her for this one because shes the one who decided to get the dog in the first place. hes not my favorite person but i dont think hes a bad guy, so it\u2019s not necessarily a red flag on his part so much as hers"]}
