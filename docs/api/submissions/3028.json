Well, then Edward (name changed) came along. Edward is their 64 year old son. He is intellectually disabled.

Then Edward started coming over, walking in my yard without an invite, knocking on my door every couple of hours so I still tried being nice\u2026 then he started saying stuff about me not being home. After that, he told my contractor that he\u2019s been looking in my windows and coming into my yard.\n\nI\u2019m a single female and that just makes me super uncomfortable.

I understand why the neighbors didn\u2019t want you to put up a fence. They wanted their son to be allowed to roam wherever he wanted. Very sad. I have a developmentally disabled younger brother, and we know it\u2019s dangerous to let him roam around on his own.", "NTA - unfortunately with his disability, law enforcement often have their hands tied because he's not of sound mind.  However it doesn't mean you shouldn't contact the authorities every time he harasses you.  A jail would not be an appropriate facility for him for his behaviour but a residential care home may be.  Especially if his parents are unable to do anything to help control his behaviour.  They sound like they may have enabled him but the reality is that they are old.\n\nThey would have to be in their 80's.  Is he supposed to be helping them.  Next time you see them perhaps ask what will happen to him once they are unable to live at home?", "You've done the right thing. You have to be comfortable in your home and you did give serious consideration to a lower fence. You've thought it through and have come to a reasonable conclusion. I'm sorry you have a troublesome neighbour. Keep your doors locked and maybe get a lock for your fence, too, to limit his intrusions.", "NTA!! You tried to compromise with your neighbors but they would not listen. You felt uncomfortable with their son\u2019s behavior so you did what was needed to protect yourself.", "NTA\n\nIt's your property so you should do whatever it takes to feel safe and doesn't violate your HOA. \n\nI suggest getting a ring or some other type of video surveillance and monitoring system just in case you need video evidence of what you're dealing with. \n\nHope it all works out and you enjoy your new home!\n\n\u270c\ud83c\udffd", "NTA\n\nI don't see how you possibly could be.\n\nThe couple next door need to do some thinking.  \n\nWhy does this person we have called the police on several times, and who we let your son scream abuse at because he wants to peep through her windows, NOT WANT to remove a fence so we can interact more?\n\nYou're being nice by not calling the cops over the abuse, someone yelling every time they see you must be getting old real fast.", "Nope, NTA. There's no possible way you could be the asshole here. It's your home, Edward is violating your private property.", "NTA. You're right that a disability isn't anyone's fault but you deserve to feel safe in the home you bought. \n\nI don't live in America so forgive me, but did the permit have to be put up, publicly? In my country, permit notices are displayed in the front yard. They show details like the type of structure and the boundary. It's then open for people to object to (if the structure might overlook them for example). If the neighbors had a chance to object but didn't, it's on them. If they didn't have the chance to object, the city obviously approved the project. So they don't have any grounds to object now.", "NTA. You need it for your dog. Your elderly neighbors can and should impress upon their son to stay away from your home. Maybe encourage them to plant a fast-growing hedge on their side of the fence?", "NTA", "Either you or an attorney write up a \u201cdo not come on my property, do not ring my bell, do not speak to me or my dog\u201d letter and deliver it regular mail and certified mail. When he inevitably rings your doorbell or yells at you again, call the police and start a paper trail. You can then call Adult Protective Services in your county and they can step in since the parents are clearly not able to control their \u201cchild\u201d and it\u2019s dangerous for everyone involved.", "NTA - your property, you decide what fence you want. And because of the neighbor\u2019s son\u2019s actions, a fence that high is a really good idea. That said, record evidence of your neighbors intruding on your property and being nasty. This way, if need be, you can get a restraining order. You should feel safe in your own home.", "NTA\n\nAnd you need to talk to your neighbors. Having an intellectual disability isn't excuse for that poor behavior.

I would install surveillance cameras and not let my dog outside without me being home. This man is terrorizing her. I understand he has a disability, but you have the right to privacy in your own home. I would keep documentation of everything. I hope this situation gets easier, but I\u2019m not sure that it will. There are facilities for adults with disabilities and it seems like his parents are at an age that they cannot care for him anymore or keep him off of your property.", "NTA. He is behaving in an unsafe, threatening way and his parents are harassing you. His disability does not make it acceptable or tolerable for him to peep and scream and repeatedly approach you. Call the cops when he does it.", "NTA. Neurodiversity is no excuse for his parents neglecting to work with him and find a good solution to keep things as safe and amiable as possible. You have no obligation to deal with that situation. Period.", "NTA. I think you have been considerate about talking with the neighbours and compromising.\n\nBut then something happened that made you feel unsafe and fear for your and your neighbours' safety.  \n\n\nI think the reason 'Edward' is shouting is because his parents are angry and told something to him. But that's a guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suggest that you file a report if they keep harrassing you.", "NTA \n\nIt is your home and you have a right to privacy and enjoyment of it. Is just the backyard fenced? I\u2019ve seen cases where in high conflict neighbors, the fenced in yard was there and a privacy fence was extended all the way along the property line to road easement. Can you do that or get some fast growing privacy shrubs or trees like arborvitae?", "NTA\n\nThe way you describe it, the fence is just as much about your personal security as it is about keeping your dog in. You also got all the necessary permits, so please don't feel bad or guilty about building that fence.\n\nWhile mental disability is noones fault, it also shouldn't be seen as a carte blanche for inappropriate behavior. If the elderly parents can't control the behavior of their son, other measures need to be taken like hiring a caretaker or worst case having him live in a special care facility.", "NTA You should have built it higher. With a moat. I wonder if Tesla do a remote controlled drawbridge.", "NTA. Self defense, no pun intended but I\u2019ll take it, should be a high priority for you at this point.  As others have stated, document everything.", "NTA. Maybe ad some barbwire? Perhaps a moat? Piranhas? A few more dogs? .. big ones?\n\nBut seriously, get cameras installed, like yesterday.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you NEED that fence to determine the unacceptable behavior of the son!!! Sounds like your safety is a potential future issue had you not put up a good fence ... but watch out in future. The son sounds like he is escalating and may not have the reasoning capability to understand. My fear is if he becomes dangerous.", "NTA\n\nWhile we should be understanding and show patience, we also have to do what is appropriate for our space. You tried to accommodate but they were not willing to work with you. And their son does not is going too far. You tried. You tried within reason but they want you to fully accommodate their son due to his situation and that isn\u2019t fair. \n\nThey will get over it. I would just ignore them. I once had a landlord couple with a special needs son living next door. He had access to the rental house backyard which I knew but wasn\u2019t told he would spend hours on a squeaky swing. I was in college and drove me crazy. But so dealt with it. But once in the winter I was coming home and she was dropping something in the mailbox and he was with her. He was 12 and the steps were icy and he pushed me. I almost fell down the stair but luckily was able to grab the railing. After that I always had a great deal of distance because he wasn\u2019t taught not to touch people and he almost killed me. \n\nI know it is hard but for the parents but safety of others needs to be addressed. He could do something your dog could find threatening and could hurt the man. It is safer for everyone to have that fence.", "The comment\n\n>I could do four feet but my dog WOULD get in their yard\n\nmakes this ESH.  Fence or no fence, OP has the responsibility of keeping the dog contained on their own property.  \n\nNeighbors: \"fine, go with the 4 foot fence.  We've got the pound on speed dial.\"", "According to my contractor, Edward cannot read, write, or drive. His parents are 88 and 97 and once they die everyone in town hopes the state steps in.", "I do lock the door! Honestly a little for HIS safety. My normally sweet Weimaraner is not happy with this man. And if he fucks around, he might find out.", "The new Ring is on its way! I knew I\u2019d have to document how often he rings my bell\u2026 I barely can get any work done.", "Ugh. I had to go over to the city office and took my dog because they\u2019re welcome and she loves it. He was screaming bloody murder at my dog and I . Multiple people saw. My usually sweet dog started low growling at him, and one guy was like \u201cgood girl, I hate him too\u201d", "No, my contractor just went over and as a courtesy let them know I was putting the fence in", "You can even call APS now if you want to, but document document document", "I know this sounds cruel but if he cannot respect (or comprehend the logic behind) your boundaries, It is sadly, sometimes best (easier) not to have a relationship. \n\nYou are a young woman, who has not specified she has training or experience with vulnerable adults, I would absolutely not get involved. Leave this to the parents and document all events it case it leads to harassment or a break in etc. \n\nAnd sorry if this seems cynical, maybe after he adjusts to the fence you can wave and say hello, but remember he may struggle to understand it is just a wave and a greeting.", "If that is the case, best he go to a group home now while his parents can transition him.\n\nYou should try and reframe this situation. Not \u2018I am being terrorised by a man not of sound mind and nobody is helping me\u2019 but \u2018there is a poor, unhappy man not of sound mind who is not being properly supervised and is a danger to himself and others, and as a member of his community, I want something done to help him, now, not wait until it is too late.\u2019\n\nAnd in so doing, film him when he loses his shit at you, take pictures, send them to whatever guardian or protective services exist and say \u2018this man with a disability needs help.\u2019\n\nYou will not be helped, you\u2019re the sticking up nail, you will be hammered down because he was there before you and he is not in a right mind. HE might be helped, which will help you.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair, but it\u2019s life.", "From the sound of it you should consider calling APS because he needs assistance that his parents either cannot or will not provide. That way at least he\u2019s set up before they die.", "I'm glad you have a big dog. I'm genuinely scared for your safety but that makes me feel better. Please contact authorities about his trespassing.", "Make sure you document as much as possible maybe get a camera for the back as well - I don't know the laws in your area but if Edward is antagonizing your dog and gets attacked or tried to come in your house and got attacked you want some kind of evidence so you don't lose your dog", "Get a camera for the back too. I wouldn't be surprised if he does things to your fence or dog over time.", "put a front fence up", "LMFAO that guy is my hero.", "I still think they have no grounds. They don't like the look of it but they don't own your yard. Not at all fair of them. \n\nAlso my parents house backed on to a row of houses. The two back gardens were only separated by hedges. The number of random dogs that appeared there was higher than 0. If the dog gets into their yard, I guarantee they'd complain.", "I\u2019d love to, but back fence due to size was 15k. I have other things that need to take the priority right now\u2026", "Along with the fence, talk to the sheriff's office and ask them what you need to do to keep someone off your property. In the US if you put up \"no trespassing\" signs, and someone goes on your property uninvited, they are technically trespassing, which is a crime. If you have proof of that (hello ring camera) you can have them \"legally trespassed\", where a law enforcement officer has them sign paperwork saying they are trespassed from your property and cannot go on there for any reason.\n\nOn one hand you don't want to be a dick to your neighbors and their disabled son. On the other hand, you are a single female and you need to look out of yourself, and the elderly neighbors need to watch their disabled son better if he's being creepy on your property.", "As per a police officer, a no trespassing sign is not legally enforceable. You must tell the trespasser that they are not welcome"]}
