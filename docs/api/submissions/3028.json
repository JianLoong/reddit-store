He was 12 and the steps were icy and he pushed me. I almost fell down the stair but luckily was able to grab the railing. After that I always had a great deal of distance because he wasn\u2019t taught not to touch people and he almost killed me. \n\nI know it is hard but for the parents but safety of others needs to be addressed.

A friend of mine had a disabled brother \"John.\" The parents cared for John. Once they hit their 80's, the other kids BEGGED their parents to transition John into a group home. Wait lists are long and abrupt transitions were never good. I think the parents were hoping one of the other kids would take John in, but the reality was none of them were in a position to do that either due to their own living/work situations or poor health. \n\nOf course, both parents die within 6 months of each other and John has nowhere to go. The sibs had to scramble to find housing for John and, long story short, it was awful. John had, within a couple of months, lost both parents and moved out of the only home he'd known his entire life. \n\nThe situation could have been handled so much better and caused John so much less suffering. :-(", "This seems to be the answer. His parents are not helping him and honestly given how his mental state has been described, he's not the ones calling the sheriff.\n\nNot only do I think you should record him and try to get adult protective services involved, I do think you should still treat the parents like they are harassing you because they are", "I agree with the group home, at the very least he needs a PCA (personal care assistant) and a case manager so he can have some structure in his life. Even a day program he could go to would be nice. Program during the day, PCA in the evening, group home permanently, whatever, but he really does need help.", "In many two-party consent states if you make it really damn obvious you are recording, you are in the clear if the other person says, \"I don't consent to being recorded put that away,\" you refuse, and they continue the conversation anyway despite knowing you are recording them.\n\nIf you want to catch sound on your security cameras in a two-party consent state most only require you to post a sign that says the area is under A/V surveillance.  I have a friend who lives in California (two-party consent), and they have cameras that record sound with signs posted around the yard warning people that they are in range of A/V surveillance.  They did that after talking to a lawyer and law enforcement, both okayed it.", "Yea I\u2019m already thinking about him vandalizing the fence from his side\u2026 and it was not cheap in the slightest.", "Wait, What?  \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23  That's BRILLIANT!  Did that actually work?", "I'm not sure Edward could legally give consent, given his special needs.", "Most places have contingencies built into the laws where it is on the parents/guardians to give consent or prevent their child/adult dependent from being recorded.  That means if Edward's parents don't want him recorded then they have to put more effort into keeping him away from OP."]}
