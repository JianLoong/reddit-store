He was 12 and the steps were icy and he pushed me. I almost fell down the stair but luckily was able to grab the railing. After that I always had a great deal of distance because he wasn\u2019t taught not to touch people and he almost killed me. \n\nI know it is hard but for the parents but safety of others needs to be addressed.

A friend of mine had a disabled brother \"John.\" The parents cared for John. Once they hit their 80's, the other kids BEGGED their parents to transition John into a group home. Wait lists are long and abrupt transitions were never good. I think the parents were hoping one of the other kids would take John in, but the reality was none of them were in a position to do that either due to their own living/work situations or poor health. \n\nOf course, both parents die within 6 months of each other and John has nowhere to go. The sibs had to scramble to find housing for John and, long story short, it was awful. John had, within a couple of months, lost both parents and moved out of the only home he'd known his entire life. \n\nThe situation could have been handled so much better and caused John so much less suffering. :-(", "This seems to be the answer.

Edward\u2019s parents are elderly and it sounds as if it\u2019s too late.  Here are my concerns & suggestions for your situation:\n\n1.  It may vary from place to place, but generally mentally disabled people should have a case worker assigned by the state.  We have multiple cousins with disabilities in my generation who all went through a guardianship process with their state (Oregon, Idaho, Texas) in order to remain in their parents\u2019 home after the age of 18.  If I were you, I\u2019d call CPS and report that you are being harassed by a mentally disabled adult and that the parents appear to have lost control of his behavior.   They should be able to tell you which agency you need to call (or they will do it for you).  I run a camp for mentally disabled adults each summer, and when I had a camper engage in sexually inappropriate behavior, my camp director had me call CPS.  The state followed up and that camper has notes in his file so he can be carefully watched.  He\u2019s also not allowed back at camp. It\u2019s a start.\n\n2.  You are being harassed, so it\u2019s time to start calling the police every time Edward does something that fits into the area of harassment (trespassing, screaming at you, etc.).  Please don\u2019t think of this as a punishment, but as your helping Edward get the help he needs.  It\u2019s a paper trail that will help officials start the process of placing Edward in a better situation that will ensure everyone\u2019s safety.  If his parents are elderly, it would be best for Edward to be placed in a group home situation now while they are still alive and can help him emotionally transition to a new living situation.  Think of it this way:  What if Edward were to harass someone who carries a gun and got shot because the victim felt unsafe?  Helping the authorities document his unsafe behaviors helps Edward.  Right now, the documentation is not about Edward\u2019s behavior, but about yours.  That doesn\u2019t help Edward.\n\nYou are NTA about the fence.  Please put padlocks on your gates so Edward cannot access your yard, and if you can afford it, install cameras on the front door and facing any windows Edward can access to look into your house.  Start creating the written and video documentation you need.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA, I recently put up a 6ft chainlink fence at great expense around my property to keep my dogs safe, and next door is not happy they like everything open. My issue is they have kids and one of our dogs is afraid of kids. Like you everything is permitted in.

Ignore the neighbors and if they keep calling the authorities, get a restraining order.", "NTA, and OP, don't feel like you have to deal with harassment just because of someone else's disability.
