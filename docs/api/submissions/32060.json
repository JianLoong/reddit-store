Let's see:\n\n>   I honestly love it and do it anyway because that's what makes me happy, much to her annoyance. \n\nOk, so you love gambling so much that you do it even though it upsets your partner in life. So, gambling is more important than your wife's feelings. Not a great sign. But, as long as there are no indications of impulse control issues...\n\n> I leave my wallet at home so that I'm not tempted to spend any of our joint money in case I lose. \n\nOh, there are impulse control issues, but you have a strategy to mitigate them. \n\nLooks like the early stages of addiction to me. This is where all addicts start. You're doing something that upsets the people who love you and are needing to take special precautions to avoid gambling away your family's money. \n\nBut, I'm guessing you read all that and don't see an issue because, \"you have it under control.\" Well, if you're sure it's not a big deal, try this: go to a local gamblers anonymous meeting and listen to what the people there say and how they talk about the transition from being in control of their gambling to ruining their own lives. You're going to hear some really familiar stuff. \n\nI know this isn't why you're here and you're unlikely to listen to some rando on the internet, but if you love your family, go to 1 meeting and just listen. See if all those people whose lives are fucked now, sounded like you in their early years.", "NTA, you risked your own \"fun money\". Its your winnings and your money, it might have turned to 1000 but it all seeded from your orginial 100. If your wife wants half, start asking her for 50 each saturday.", "ESH.  You're married.

NTA", "You're NTA based on the information given on the arrangement you've set up, but I think the monetary arrangement you set up was clearly a bad idea and conflict like this was pretty much inevitable, since both of you seem to have been sitting on resentment about it for a while.\n\nYou've told your wife that you can only be engaged with hobbies that give a dopamine rush and do so via gambling, which she views, pretty reasonably, as a red flag in the general case. Even though you gamble responsibly enough, she's clearly unhappy that's how you choose to use your finances. Then, as soon as you won reasonably big, you treated the money as your own. That's totally justifiable under the arrangement because it's your fun money, but it probably further reinforced her view that your gambling is a problem where you're being reckless with the family finances for your own benefit.\n\nNow that the conflict boiled over, you implied she uses you as an ATM, and she responds by convincing her friends you're a financial abuser, both digging in deeper and blowing up this financial arrangement while making it clear neither of you have actually been happy with it for opposite reasons; you, because you think your individual money should go further due to your higher income, and her, because she thinks she's given too little considering your joint finances, either of which could be correct depending on how your necessities etc. shake out beyond the fun money.", "You\u2019re NTA, but this is a terrible way for you both to behave in a marriage, do you even like each other?

Why does it matter who earns what for the context of this story?", "YTA\n\nThe IRS considers prize winnings as income. If you jointly file your taxes, that money belongs to both of you.

Most of all she feels left out and excluded which is not something wives handle well, and her negative attitudes towards you hitting the casino just exacerbated it..", "ESH. Nothing says true love and a resolve to work through problems together like a, ignoring your wife's legitimate concerns about a famously destructive vice because it makes you happy, b, suddenly becoming an accountant when there's money to be gained from each other, and c, complaining to friends about problems in a marriage.

If you didn't have the limited $500 each for \"fun\" money she might have a point, but this was all out of your pool.  The IRS allows you to reduce winnings by losses in gambling situations and I bet if you add up your losses you are probably close to breaking even (Casinos don't make money by paying out more then they take in but a good or lucky gambler can on occasion have a good streak).  She only considers her money \"fun money\" but your is ours.

The arrangements that you have are clearly causing divisiveness, and I'm also noticing that you have not once mentioned any activities that the two of you do TOGETHER. I also tend to believe that even if you won $25 instead of $500, the reaction would have been similar; there's a deeper reason why she feels entitled and definitely some imbalances in the relationship if you want to really extrapolate.\n\nThis isn't about the money or how it's spent at all. The two of you need to hash your shit out.", "Wow, your wife is being entitled and greedy. You took $100 of your own money and won, and she thinks she is entitled to half!! The fact that she went to her friends complained about you ( disloyal) and let them abuse you over it is a poor partner. This would be a hill I would die on. She is entitled,  greedy, selfish, and disloyal.

I think, for me, that's what makes YTA. You already make 3x what she does, and it sounds like you have a chip on your shoulder about it.", "Hmm I\u2019m going to say YTA because she\u2019s technically right that it\u2019s taxable income", "NTA What is she the IRS? Only interested in her take when you win but is nowhere to  be found when you lose.", "NTA - And your wife is on some socialism and communism BS, lmao. \n\n>My wife hates that I gamble because she thinks I'll go down a \"destructive path\" but I honestly love it and do it anyway because that's what makes me happy, much to her annoyance.\n\nI can totally see your wife's concern, actually.
