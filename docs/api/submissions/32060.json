Let's see:\n\n>   I honestly love it and do it anyway because that's what makes me happy, much to her annoyance. \n\nOk, so you love gambling so much that you do it even though it upsets your partner in life. So, gambling is more important than your wife's feelings. Not a great sign. But, as long as there are no indications of impulse control issues...\n\n> I leave my wallet at home so that I'm not tempted to spend any of our joint money in case I lose. \n\nOh, there are impulse control issues, but you have a strategy to mitigate them. \n\nLooks like the early stages of addiction to me. This is where all addicts start. You're doing something that upsets the people who love you and are needing to take special precautions to avoid gambling away your family's money. \n\nBut, I'm guessing you read all that and don't see an issue because, \"you have it under control.\" Well, if you're sure it's not a big deal, try this: go to a local gamblers anonymous meeting and listen to what the people there say and how they talk about the transition from being in control of their gambling to ruining their own lives. You're going to hear some really familiar stuff. \n\nI know this isn't why you're here and you're unlikely to listen to some rando on the internet, but if you love your family, go to 1 meeting and just listen. See if all those people whose lives are fucked now, sounded like you in their early years.", "NTA, you risked your own \"fun money\".

NTA", "You're NTA based on the information given on the arrangement you've set up, but I think the monetary arrangement you set up was clearly a bad idea and conflict like this was pretty much inevitable, since both of you seem to have been sitting on resentment about it for a while.\n\nYou've told your wife that you can only be engaged with hobbies that give a dopamine rush and do so via gambling, which she views, pretty reasonably, as a red flag in the general case. Even though you gamble responsibly enough, she's clearly unhappy that's how you choose to use your finances. Then, as soon as you won reasonably big, you treated the money as your own. That's totally justifiable under the arrangement because it's your fun money, but it probably further reinforced her view that your gambling is a problem where you're being reckless with the family finances for your own benefit.\n\nNow that the conflict boiled over, you implied she uses you as an ATM, and she responds by convincing her friends you're a financial abuser, both digging in deeper and blowing up this financial arrangement while making it clear neither of you have actually been happy with it for opposite reasons; you, because you think your individual money should go further due to your higher income, and her, because she thinks she's given too little considering your joint finances, either of which could be correct depending on how your necessities etc. shake out beyond the fun money.", "You\u2019re NTA, but this is a terrible way for you both to behave in a marriage, do you even like each other?

Why does it matter who earns what for the context of this story?", "YTA\n\nThe IRS considers prize winnings as income. If you jointly file your taxes, that money belongs to both of you.

Most of all she feels left out and excluded which is not something wives handle well, and her negative attitudes towards you hitting the casino just exacerbated it..", "ESH.

If you didn't have the limited $500 each for \"fun\" money she might have a point, but this was all out of your pool.  The IRS allows you to reduce winnings by losses in gambling situations and I bet if you add up your losses you are probably close to breaking even (Casinos don't make money by paying out more then they take in but a good or lucky gambler can on occasion have a good streak).  She only considers her money \"fun money\" but your is ours.

I also tend to believe that even if you won $25 instead of $500, the reaction would have been similar; there's a deeper reason why she feels entitled and definitely some imbalances in the relationship if you want to really extrapolate.\n\nThis isn't about the money or how it's spent at all. The two of you need to hash your shit out.", "Wow, your wife is being entitled and greedy. You took $100 of your own money and won, and she thinks she is entitled to half!! The fact that she went to her friends complained about you ( disloyal) and let them abuse you over it is a poor partner. This would be a hill I would die on.

The attitude you have towards gambling is spot on.  Setting a clear limit that's extremely reasonable given your income and sticking to it.

Quite the opposite.", "If you lost the money, would she compensate you for half of it?  If not, NTA.", "OP, go to your wife and hold out her hand.

If she won't share in the losses, she doesn't get to share in the winnings.\n\nAnd to everyone who comments on the inequities in your relationship - folks, them's the way the cookie crumbles!  I know of very few relationships where both people make the same amount of money.  It's very easy to fall into the trap of one person thinking \"what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine!\" All because of the income imbalance.\n\nI suspect wifey-poo has a track record of expecting DH to cover her extra expenses because he makes more.  Then after it happens a couple times, it becomes easier to buy that cute dress or handbag in the store window, even though it puts you over for the month.  But DH will cover it, right?  Then she's all pikachu-faced when DH refuses.  If you read this reddit, you see it I er and over again.\n\nIt has nothing to do with owing or even liking your spouse.

Some places in the US are truly expensive and $500 is a drop in the bucket.", "I would agree that it's something he should keep an eye on, but from the post it clearly shows that he knows his limit and doesn't even spend the entire $500, only 20% of it. \n\nYour post ngl is a bit confusing, you do know gambling can be a \"social experience\" itself? OP even explained he gamble for the \"thrill\". I will however agree it's not a good hobby as getting addicted is a serious threat. But comparing it to a social experience and products and saying one is \"draining the money\" despite having possibility of increasing the amount (just like what is happening) unlike the other is dumb. I wonder if that would also be your response to investment? This is the same as investing just that the risk is very high. \n\ni also wonder what your response be if OP is spending it all on gacha games. I mean he do get a \"character\" and other online stuff, does that mean it's better than gambling?\n\nEDIT: forgot to add, NTA. You all agreed that 500 will be the disposal amount (OP didn't even increase his despite earning more). I think this is the case of the other partner wanting the other's basket too. You allocated a portion of your money in a highly risky \"investment\" that paid off this time, I would say that income should be yours. I also find it strange OP have a \"dating partner\" part of the 500 disposal money but it seems the other party doesn't even have it and when told an increase in disposal money watch how she wanted a portion of it to go to her girls trip instead of like an expensive trip for you two lol.", "I mean didn't he literally say that he takes precautions to not let the gambling get out of hand by only bringing $100 at a time and that he frequently has 1/3 to 1/2 of his money left over from the gambling to give to his wife or spend on date nights for the two of them?\n\nHe says that he does win money from it which he spends on more \"socially acceptable\" things (not sure why that's the metric we're using in this discussion). He was able to buy himself a console which is something he's never owned before and still have money left over. \n\nFrom the information given she never seems to have money left over (can't even save for her own girls trip) but him gambling in his free time is more worrying than his wife's inability to save money and her entitledness to the money that he earned and used to spoil himself?", "Yeah, the gambling bothers me. So much so that gambling in my relationship is a dealbreaker as big as cheating. I am always very clear upfront about it, if the casino on the regular is a big part of your life or you\u2019re online gambling I won\u2019t engage. I have no issue with a few bucks at a casino in Vegas, or if you happen to buy a lotto ticket, but regular gambling as a \u2018hobby\u2019 is just such a gross turn off to me. \nI\u2019ve watched people lose everything gambling. Casinos literally hire psychologists to make it as addictive as possible. For me it\u2019s like if the wife was using her fun money for recreational cocaine every weekend\u2026 \u2018but I\u2019m responsible!\u2019"]}
