We'd see maybe 2-3 spiders a year and that was it. Now after they've moved in, to hear them talk you'd think my house was in the middle of Mirkwood. It all started this past summer when my in-laws came in from my screened-in back porch and went on about seeing a black widow outside the screen. I go out there with jars in hand to put said black widow in my spider relocation program... it was an orb weaver. Two more times during the summer they saw an orb weaver on the porch or in the tool shed and came to get me saying they saw a black widow. My wife started to do the same thing. I told them what a black widow looks like and that they're rarely, if ever, seen in our area.\n\nNow that it's winter, there have been more spiders on the back porch cause poor things want to be warm too. One or two got into the house. My mil has handed me a bag before and told me to be careful because she saw a black widow jump in it... It was a wolf spider. Last week my fil and wife asked me to get rid of the black widow under the sink... another wolf spider. I've been pretty fed up with all the false calls and dealing with the occasional outdoor spider and them acting like its life or death. None of them are arachnophobic so I printed out two sheets of paper. One had pics of the three most common spiders to see around here and I put \"If it looks like this just let it chill. Do not call Spideracus.\" The second sheet I put next to it had a blown-up image of a black widow, and I highlighted features and captioned \"This is what a black widow looks like- you may proceed to call Spideracus.\"\n\nI put them all over the back porch, tool shed, and some in the closet and under the sink. My wife was not impressed and took them all down. My wife got mad that I was insulting their intelligence and belittling her parents. I just wanted them to stop getting me for every spider sighting that wasn't a danger and since they never listen to descriptions I tried a different approach.
