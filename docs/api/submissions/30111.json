If you can't afford it you can't afford it. Frankly, if she's 20 and isn't on solid financial ground in the first place, then an expensive pram probably shouldn't be a purchase at all.\n\nGive her the amount you planned to spend on the original pram, then she can decide how to combine that with the other contributions to choose something.", "NTA. Honestly, this is concerning to me about her readiness to be a mom. Like, damn.", "NTA. She can ask for what she wants, and you can choose whether to buy it. I would not buy her one she doesn\u2019t want though. Get her something else critical for the baby and let her sort out whether spending insane amounts on a pram is worth it. \n\nIt\u2019s seriously only used for a blink of an eye in the baby\u2019s life. That kind of thing can be found barely used so easily.", "She's 20 and has had \"several miscarriages\"? Dang", "NTA of course. You offered her a gift and now it isn\u2019t good enough. If it\u2019s so important to have a very expensive pram she can buy it herself. Since she\u2019s choosing to have a child I assume that she is self sufficient and able to afford it.", "Obviously NTA and geez, her entitlement, smh.\n\nThere's one thing to ask your opinion about getting a more expensive one and actually wanting to impose it on you. She's just obnoxious and rude.\n\nI suggest you just contribute to it like everyone else even if you originally wanted to buy it yourself, but if she insists, just give her the original money and let her say whatever she wants.\n\nOr even better, say it's this amount or nothing and she can go whine to her nan dearest if she was the one putting ideas in her head", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGive her what you would have originally paid, and let HER handle the difference if she wants the more expensive one.", "You're giving her a huge gift and she's being ungrateful. NTA\n\nUnfortunately you may have spoiled her too much", "NTA.  Agree with the other posters who suggest giving your step-daughter the amount of money you were willing and able to pay for the original pram, or purchase another needed baby item that costs about the same as that amount.  I'm sorry that your step-daughter seems like a very entitled brat, because that doesn't bode well for her entry into motherhood.", "NTA. I don't understand why people pay such excessive money for something baby is going to outgrow quickly.", "NTA. She sounds like a spoiled brat.

Enough said.", "WTAF She found another one that is 500 MORE?!?!  I had a very good quality one that lasted several kids, and it was only 200 total.  This Woman is off her rocker.

That's outrageous.", "My first thought reading this was a 20 yo is to young to be responsible for a child and boy howdy did she prove that point.\n\nI feel bad for your grandchild.

Just contribute the amount of the original pram that you were going to buy toward the one she wants and she can figure out the difference.", "NTA, if she wants the biggest most extravagant object she can find, she pays for the extra extravagance. Her asking you to go into debt for an item is not fair either.", "NTA \n\nAlso who the heck spends that kind of money on a pram?\n\nI paid around 100 and it's on its 4th kid.", "NTA\u2026she has two choices.  Buy the original one she wanted or you give her that cost and she can combine it with the other donations and contribute the rest to get the one she really wants.  But that is it.  Nothing more.", "NTA. Fair to whom? Your budget is your budget, and she sounds ridiculously entitled. She's unreasonable to have doubled the cost of the item she wanted and then attempt to shove that down your throat. Don't go over your budget and don't haggle with her. Someone raised her to be quite ungrateful.", "Nta\n\nAnd that's why 20y olds nowadays shouldn't have kids.\nShe's still reasoning like a child with no comprehension of the real world and how much everything costs.", "NTA\n\nThis seems simple.", "NTA and holy hell, is it made of gold? Self-driving? Sings the baby to sleep while it rocks them? I know they can be expensive in general, all baby stuff is, but 500 MORE than what was already budgeted? The amount of diapers that could buy.", "NTA my parents are buying my pram and we have agreed on a budget of \u00a3600.

She can buy whatever she wants then.", "My in-laws bought me a \u00a3600 pram that I hardly used because my boy outgrow it more or less straight away, I am expecting again and they have offered to buy my pram again I've picked a \u00a3250 pram that does exactly the same as what the venneci does but a lot cheaper. You can get a lovely pram for a couple hundred quid. It doesn't have to be a small fortune she's just being ungrateful NTA", "NTA.
