Those things can cost a fortune and new parents always seem to want a brand new top of the range one.\n\nHave you looked on marketplace or eBay? Often you can get great deals on them second hand but I would recommend a new carseat in any case. People often buy them and find they don't use them as much as they thought they would.

Sometimes people buy one new and 2 years later get another totally new one for the 2nd kid. \n\nI have a 2 year old and we were gifted a secondhand silver cross pram/buggy. I used the pram a lot but the buggy didn't suit what we needed. I don't drive and needed a buggy I could collapse one handed and easily put in taxis or travel with. So we then were gifted a secondhand mamas&papas buggy. Later I bought a cheap secondhand lightweight pushchair as it's even easier to trave with and now my daughter's a toddler we rarely use it anymore.

There is a huge market for luxury baby items that only cost more for asthetic reasons, but there is also a certain price point where most things under it aren't as safe/ lack utility. Someone depending on others to buy necessities shouldn't be choosing items double the cost of other choices that are perfectly fine. \n\nIf y'all were willing to pay from a decent stroller, that other money could be well used toward a crib, carrier, swing, etc. Maybe even one of those several hundred dollar pillows that you can relatively safely lay an infant down in.", "You \"aren't being fair\" because you can't afford to buy her the luxury pushchair that she wants?

It is a gift, not an expectation and as an an adult she should know better that the only correct response when you receive a gift is thank you, not negotiate to get more. And the fact that she did not even ask you if it was okay for her to get a more expensive pram and expected her nan to tell you is telling of her character. If she wants a more expensive one, then she can pay the difference but at this point if you did not want to pay at all due to how unreasonable she is being, I wouldn't blame you. \n\nNot sure if she has a history of doing this but personally I always advise people who are giving to give to those that will appreciate it and reciprocate.
