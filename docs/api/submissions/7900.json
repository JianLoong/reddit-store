He's very gentle and does it without pulling their hair, so it's become this little ritual on bath night. After it their hair is straight and un knotted and easier to work with, so I asked him to do it to my hair sometimes. It actually works really well, and I've grown to really like the feeling of it. It's just nice and and gentle, and after it my hair just feels a lot freer, so it just became part of our family routine.\n\nMy sister (34, lets say Jess) was staying for a week and saw this. She had been asking me what I was using in my hair for a while,  and she asked me if she could try it. She did and also found it worked out.

Let the curl/wave pattern set\n- Some people use a curl gel to really lock it in place. The key is to not scrunch the stiffness out until its fully dry! Then you get soft curls without frizz! \n- Sleep on a satin or silk pillow.. or a hair bonnet with those materials to stop your hair from getting knotted/frizzy at night.", "Manes by Mel on YouTube is a great curly resource too. \n\n She has tutorials for a bunch of different curly care, styling, and refreshing techniques.

That entire situation is boundary crossing for me. I'm good.", "Also using an apple cider vinegar rinse! Just mix a tablespoon of ACV with 2 cups of cold water and pour it over your hair at the end of shower (I usually do a quick rinse with cool water after to get rid of the vinegar scent). This helps close the cuticles of the hair strand, leaving hair silky and waaaaay less frizzy. It also reduces tangles and makes it easier to brush.
