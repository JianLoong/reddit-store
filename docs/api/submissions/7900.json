My kids _hate_ getting their hair brushed. I'm not sure when it started, but now after their bath my husband (34M) will sit with them and he manually brushes out their hair with a combination of his fingers and a tangle teaser. It takes ages, and I don't have the patience for it, but he goes through their hair and untangles the ends. He's very gentle and does it without pulling their hair, so it's become this little ritual on bath night. After it their hair is straight and un knotted and easier to work with, so I asked him to do it to my hair sometimes. It actually works really well, and I've grown to really like the feeling of it. It's just nice and and gentle, and after it my hair just feels a lot freer, so it just became part of our family routine.\n\nMy sister (34, lets say Jess) was staying for a week and saw this. She had been asking me what I was using in my hair for a while,  and she asked me if she could try it. She did and also found it worked out. I asked my husband later how it was and he just kind of shrugged it off. Said it was a bit weird doing someone else's hair.. \n\nA few weeks later and she had a work night out and asked if he could do it again. Then after that a date. Then a wedding. I know she can't regularly afford a salon, but at this stage she's just coming over and barely even asking.\n\nSome of my family were talking about it at Christmas(i wasnt in the room). My other sister (Kate,38) thinks it's weird to basically get a scalp massage from her BIL, but Jess told her it was an \"amazing intimate brushing\", and that Kate should start coming too. Kate laughed at her and pulled her up on the word intimate and it's kind of become a running joke.\n\n.... I'd just like this to stop. I don't really need Jess pimping out my husbands time and fingers, and iI know money is tight for her to get a professional to do it, but at this stage I'd just like my Saturday nights back and the little jokes to end.

Let the curl/wave pattern set\n- Some people use a curl gel to really lock it in place. The key is to not scrunch the stiffness out until its fully dry! Then you get soft curls without frizz! \n- Sleep on a satin or silk pillow.. or a hair bonnet with those materials to stop your hair from getting knotted/frizzy at night.", "Manes by Mel on YouTube is a great curly resource too. \n\n She has tutorials for a bunch of different curly care, styling, and refreshing techniques.

That entire situation is boundary crossing for me. I'm good.", "Also using an apple cider vinegar rinse! Just mix a tablespoon of ACV with 2 cups of cold water and pour it over your hair at the end of shower (I usually do a quick rinse with cool water after to get rid of the vinegar scent).

When I brush my hair after my shower when my hair is wet, apply the leave in conditioner, then brush my hair to make sure it\u2019s all evenly in there, apply some curling cream, brush again, then take a small amount more and scrunch the hair. Let it dry, blow drying will make it less frizzy than hair drying. Also I don\u2019t apply product soaking wet. In the shower before I step out I just squeeze my hair to get a lot of the excess water out. Then I let my hair sit in a towel for a couple minutes or so just to get excess water out (towels can add frizzy so if you wanna avoid that I\u2019ve heard using old t-shirts make it less frizzy). So my hair is still damp but not soaking wet. Then if my hair is still a bit frizzy after, I take a very very small amount of hair oil and use my fingers to brush that over my hair. A little goes a long way with hair oil. I wash a couple times a week (washing/shampooing too often can strip your hair of natural oils). In between washes I use my fingers to brush my hair to get out any tangles without making my hair poof or frizz. Now my hair is curly, happy, and healthy. I had no idea my hair could be like this. It sounds like you have a similar hair to mine, so I thought I\u2019d share my routine since it\u2019s been mind blowing how great my hair has been doing.
