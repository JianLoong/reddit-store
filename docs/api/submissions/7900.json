It's mostly straight, but the ends curl into each other and get knotted up. I have tried various brands of hair care and brushes.. but I've long accepted that when I brush my hair I'm going to leave a lot on the brush.\n\nMy sisters and 2 of my daughters have inherited the same hair. My kids _hate_ getting their hair brushed. I'm not sure when it started, but now after their bath my husband (34M) will sit with them and he manually brushes out their hair with a combination of his fingers and a tangle teaser. It takes ages, and I don't have the patience for it, but he goes through their hair and untangles the ends. He's very gentle and does it without pulling their hair, so it's become this little ritual on bath night. After it their hair is straight and un knotted and easier to work with, so I asked him to do it to my hair sometimes. It actually works really well, and I've grown to really like the feeling of it. It's just nice and and gentle, and after it my hair just feels a lot freer, so it just became part of our family routine.\n\nMy sister (34, lets say Jess) was staying for a week and saw this. She had been asking me what I was using in my hair for a while,  and she asked me if she could try it. She did and also found it worked out. I asked my husband later how it was and he just kind of shrugged it off. Said it was a bit weird doing someone else's hair.. \n\nA few weeks later and she had a work night out and asked if he could do it again. Then after that a date. Then a wedding. I know she can't regularly afford a salon, but at this stage she's just coming over and barely even asking.\n\nSome of my family were talking about it at Christmas(i wasnt in the room). My other sister (Kate,38) thinks it's weird to basically get a scalp massage from her BIL, but Jess told her it was an \"amazing intimate brushing\", and that Kate should start coming too. Kate laughed at her and pulled her up on the word intimate and it's kind of become a running joke.\n\n.... I'd just like this to stop. I don't really need Jess pimping out my husbands time and fingers, and iI know money is tight for her to get a professional to do it, but at this stage I'd just like my Saturday nights back and the little jokes to end.

You have wavy or curly hair and don\u2019t know it. I discovered I had curly hair as a teen when I had just thought i had frizzy hair! Number one, stop brushing it. Comb with a wide toothed comb in the shower with conditioner in your hair. Next, check out YouTube videos on curly girl method. You\u2019ll be surprised at how much less hair you lose and how much healthier it\u2019ll look. It\u2019ll take a while for the natural pattern to show up, but it\u2019s so so worth it! But yes, unless you\u2019ve purposely straightened your hair, you can quit brushing it and only comb it out when you wash. And don\u2019t wash every day. Your hair is probably dry. I hope you find a routine of products that works for you!", "I think my hair is like yours and using products for curly hair works for me!!

Curly Crew is a good one. Come to the curl side we have fab hair!", "Honestly all you need to do is get a wide tooth comb, cheap conditioner, and comb through hair when it has conditioner or while it\u2019s damp. Do not use a brush. Brushes are not made for curly hair. They just frizz the hair. Also get a denman brush. The teeth of the comb/brush are separated enough for curly hair but the brush handle is comfy to use. Watch YouTube videos on maintaining curly hair. A lot of methods curly hair people use across curl types is interchangeable so don\u2019t be scared if you don\u2019t see your exact hair type!", "Then tell them to stop.
