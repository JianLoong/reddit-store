Sounds like they fear losing a free babysitter.\n\nAlso a lot of resentment of sister.", "INFO: Aside from wondering about childcare and what you're providing, I am wondering if your son and his wife have done a lot of you over the years while your daughter has been largely absent. Your wife died. Who was there for you to lean and who was there to take you in? Who helped you deal with the funeral and etc. I'm wondering if what's happening here is that your son has been there for you every day and in every way, and now you have a chance to know your daughter better, and your son may feel like you don't value him and what he's done for you. He may be very angry at Angie for not being a better daughter for you and your wife, and now it seems like all's forgiven and she did't have to do anything to get back into your good graces, while your son has worked his ass off for you and has been there for you. He may see you as dismissing him in favor of someone he sees as unworthy of you moving and helping them.", ">  is there any chance you are currently helping them a lot with childcare, and their reaction night be based on that?\n\nThat was actually my first thought: While I'm sure the thought of dad who's always been there moving away is troubling, I wonder if some of it is the loss of the built-in babysitter?", "Exactly what I was thinking as soon as I read \u201c3 kids, all under 5.\u201d", "Your statement that he owes his adult children nothing is contradictive to his motives for moving. He has guilt for his daughter making poor decisions, lack of financial stability to work on their home, and working the night shift while she was younger and missing out on her childhood.\n\nOP YTA not for moving but for what you said about your grandchildren. Just bc OP\u2019s son and daughter n law didn\u2019t process their disappointment in a healthy way doesn\u2019t justify talking about his grandchildren like that. For the same logic you used to leave them your son could just as well deny you ever seeing your grandchildren ever again because as you said they\u2019re not your children.", "I spend time with the kids, but I don't proivide childcare in any sense other than once in a while, they'll spend the night at grandpa's house.", "Yes, she was thrilled when I offered, and she has made plans for me staying in the house as we remodel. When that's finished, I'll buy a small place out there for myself.", "Yeah, I\u2019m with you on that. At first, it will be twice a year, then eventually once a year, then it will whittle down to \u201cmaybe\u201d this year, and eventually just not even go. If that is a risk he is willing to take, then so be it.", "That makes the most logical sense to me, because I understand being upset about him moving but the way they reacted (like its objectively awful and unheard of that a grandparent might not live nearby their grandkid) is not normal. At least here in the United States people certainly don't consider it an expected norm that grandparents live nearby and have very close relationships with the grandkids (especially in recent generations, where grandparents are usually still working) and I've never seen someone judge someone for not living in driving distance of their grandkids lol", "> OP YTA not for moving but for what you said about your grandchildren. Just bc OP\u2019s son and daughter n law didn\u2019t process their disappointment in a healthy way doesn\u2019t justify talking about his grandchildren like that\n\nI don't think so. He only said that after they pressed the issue. They asked if the daughter is more important than the grandkids. There is no winning answer there and the answer he gave was the honest one. I have no grandkids, but if I were pressed to choose between my kids and one of my siblings, or even my kids or my parents, I would choose the kids -- they're my kids. They're going to come second in my life, right after my wife, period.", "It isn't quite clear why your son is this upset.\n\nYou don't provide childcare. And from the way you speak about them it doesn't seem like you're very close to your grandkids even though you spend time with them. I am not seeing why Eric is upset really. Is there any other information that you think might help?", "Then NTA, your son will adjust", "Right? I mean, take the sister out of the equation and say he's moving because he really likes the that region of the US, would they feel the same way? Or flip it and say the son and his family are moving across country for a job or something: would they expect dad to move to stay near them? That would be bizarre, too. I mean, sure, some of it is going to be the feeling of 'choosing her over me/us' but it sounds like it was way out of proportion for that, unless there's a lot of backstory not provided. But I think it's a matter of losing him as a babysitter, especially since DiL reacted that way so quickly, as well.", "I in no way defended his children in my previous post. You\u2019re right there\u2019s no win win in their situation but OP still didn\u2019t have to take it that far. My statement still stands if his son never allowed him time with his grand kids for his statement they\u2019re just as much in the right for him making his statement that they\u2019re not his kids. He\u2019s essentially saying he has no obligation to be in their life because they\u2019re not his children. \n\nYou are right your spouse comes first, then kids, and finally extended family. But pick up the slack for your adult children is a moral choice not an obligation, it begs the question at what point do your kids need to grow up and take responsibility for their actions.", "Right, but again, he didn't say his daughter is more important than his grandkids until his son forced him to. There were three options there: \"Yes, she is\", \"No, she isn't\", or \"That's a ridiculous question I'm not going to answer.\" The first and the last would be seen as the same response by the son and the middle one would be weaponized by the son.", "NTA. You're feeling lost since your wife passed, and you now have the opportunity to help your daughter rehab her home. This will be good for YOU. Your son is only considering the time you won't spend with his children, not all the time you've already spent with them, which your daughter hasn't had all these years. He isn't considering your feelings or future. Regardless of how he feels about your daughter, he should be happy that you are choosing to do something that will give you some direction rather than being lost. Maybe talking to him about how you're feeling and how this opportunity will help you and not focusing on your daughter will help him understand where you're coming from. Go and enjoy helping your daughter build her home and getting to know her and her husband better, and plan trips to visit your son and his family a few times a year.", "NTA. You are an adult with your own life and identity. That identity is not just \u201cgrandpa and free babysitter.\u201d If you wanted to move to an island and drink Mojitos on the beach, it would still be a valid reason.

How is moving affecting him ? I\u2019m confused", "NTA (it would be N A H but your son and DIL'S reactions were too much. Disappointment is one thing, rage is a different one). I think your son probably doesn't like your daughter very much due to their history/her past actions.

Your son may want you there for the kids (interestingly not for him or his wife, tho?), but it's always been a possibility you could move. I mean, places like FL are known for snowbirds. Your son's wants ultimately do not overrule your own, and he should've realized that before he used his own values to determine where they'd raise the kids. Maybe he feels hurt about that, too. But, there are phones and computers now. You guys can write emails and call and Facetime and then meet up during summer or something! Lots of people grow up not living right next to their grandparents and they turned out okay. You will all be fine once everyone's had time to cool off, I think.\n\nPersonally, my grandma did stay where she was for her grandkids and to some degree she regrets it now because she lives in a big house they grew up in all alone since my grandpa died. It's lonely and tough over time. Do what is right for you.", "NTA It's your life and you get to choose how and where to live it.  By any chance are you the FREE babysitter?

Now OP is abandoning him too, not because his sister needs him, but because he wants to bond more with her. \n\nThat I think is what stings the most - it's not OP choosing daughter's needs over son's needs. It's OP desiring a bond with daughter more than he wants to nurture his bond with his son. It's about what OP wants, and of course it would hurt to know your dad wants a relationship with the sibling who left more than with the one who stayed. \n\nLove is not a zero sum game; but attention and proximity are.

Both of my grandfathers were dead by the time I was born so honestly they should be happy to meet their grandfather at all, so there\u2019s my bit of personal projection onto this scenario.

They live together 2500 miles away from me, and I\u2019m about to have my first baby with my husband. \n\nIt really sucks that my mom can\u2019t spend more time with me during this time and with her grandchild soon.

I don\u2019t need her, I *want* her. I can feel however I\u2019m going to feel about that, but I know in my heart it\u2019s just how it is. My brother deserves to feel safe and happy, and right now he needs her presence to remain stable.

Heading to CO could make for some wonderful trips and adventures with the grandkids when they have time.  \n\nHe is being selfish and ridiculous.  I would say \"Eric, you know I love you and the kids.  But I'm feeling a bit lost and a change would do me good.\"\n\nI wonder if he is lamenting the loss of free on demand child care.", "NTA.

Now is her time to have some father daughter bonding!", "NTA, it sounds like your searching for something to occupy your time that can bring you some sense of purpose after losing your wife. If your son had said he didnt want you to move cause he didnt want to lose the presence of a parent so soon I would be more on the fence.

Children grow up and move away, parents also have that right.", "So, your son handled this badly. And your daughter, who made a lot of bad choices (your words) is going to benefit because you need a project. To me, its seems more like she's the lucky beneficiary as opposed to a preference of one child over the other.  Sometimes life works out that way but it still may feel unfair to the son who did it correctly, who lost his mom and now you're leaving too.\n\nIt's tough for a child, even when grown, to see a parent spend so much time helping a sibling who probably took up all your time in their youth.   Like, the weaker squeakier child gets all the help.\n\nWas she the trouble child and was your son ignored or set aside while you dealt with get shenanigans? Only you know these answers. But to be honest, those shenanigans often don't completely go away even when one \"grows up.\"  People who are messes tend to stay messes on some level,  You may not really know what living close to your daughter will be like.  I suggest you try a few long stays before you up and move to make sure you all can get along for the long haul.\n\nYou will unfortunately be a stranger to the grandkids.  If you want a relationship with them, you have to develop that and one or two days a year is not going to accomplish that.  You need to know that and it sounds like you may be fine with it.  Just Don't be a fool and think you can make it up when the are teens...because then they won't give a crap about you then...they'll be too busy and full of hormones to care. These young years are the magic and when you can become a staple in their life.   Missing this will inevitably change their lives and their perception of what a grandparent means to them.\n\nI pass no judgement. I think you need to try and carve out a life without your partner, but try not to leave the bulk of your family in the rear view mirror.  I think leaving on bad terms would be a mistake.  Your son is shocked, give him some time to process.  You lost your wife...and he lost his mom.  It's not all rosy for him at the moment and now you want to uproot and leave him too.   I'm sure that doesn't feel good.  Also having several kids at that young age is very stressful.  He'a probably over stimulated and having his own mental health issues. I think you both need to give each other some grace.\n\nCan you not strike a compromise. Moving is permanent. \nWhat about long stays in Colorado?\n\nI will tell you i'm in my forties and i love my parents.  My opinions here are colored by my own experiences however. I always thought they were amazing people.  But being the baby and now having children of my own, i see now how my siblings benefited much more than i ever did.  My kids dont get grandparents, we rarely see them due to their age and they no longer desire to travel.  Keep in mind i'm a car drive away...not a flight.  And Thats funny because they had no issues hoping in a plane to babysit my brothers kids...like all the time. They are older now, i get it, I understand it, i dont hate them for it....but i see how my brothers got so much more and i know i'm loved but i'm the after thought. Never informed of events like grandma's bday party (she's 101..kind if a big deal) Never invited....i learned about due to my SIL's FB posts.  I'm just, invisible. They just forget me. I call frequently, every week, and yet i'm an after thought.\n\nDont let your son and grand children become invisible. \nThings with your daughter may not be so rosy once you get their.  Patch things up and keep an open mind. \n\nGood luck.", "Your son's relationship with his sister could be the issue. Your relationship with her is always going to be different than his and he needs to realize that. \nOften the good kid feels screwed over when a different sibling is problematic, they feel like they aren't cared about as much since they can be stuck in a corner and not paid attention to while all the energy is used on the difficult child. This could be where he is coming from.\n\nI would explain to him that this is about you taking on an adventure for yourself. It's not like you would never see them, and you may move back.\nThis is finding your way in your new life.\n\nNAH They might just be shocked, and concerned if their kids have a strong relationship with you. They just lost their grandmother too.\n\nYou telling your grandkids is appropriate.", "NTA loads of kids don\u2019t see their grandparents but a few times a year.

Hopefully you can make it effort to visit often and have him out to visit as well.", "ESH\n\nI think you shouldn\u2019t have let your son bait you into that very hurtful statement that your daughter means more than your grandchildren.  I\u2019m not sure you mean it in the way that even you think you do. I think you were justifiably frustrated and exasperated at that point. But it was still not the smartest response to give and could cost you extra effort now to regain your ground with your son and his wife. \n\nThat outburst ignores a wealth of nuance that matters.  A grandchild CAN matter as much as an adult child. All of your relationships are precious and you shouldn\u2019t allow people to push you to choose like that especially so someone can score one over you on an argument.  \n\nDon\u2019t fall for that ever again.  Always say that all of your relationships are important.  And then explain that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to attend to one that was ignored far too long. And that you trust that your relationship with your son and grandchildren is good and special and solid enough that you can take some time out to right a wrong that weighs on your heart and STILL keep going strong with them.  And that you\u2019d appreciate their understanding and love and help to do all of that. \n\nI had a grandma who lived 3 hours away and was in my life for birthdays and holidays. I had another grandmother who lived in Asia whom I didn\u2019t meet until I was 11.  I did get to live with her a few months at a time off and on over the next few years until I turned 23. She got Alzheimer\u2019s after that and I was never able to visit her again because of my job. \n\nWe couldn\u2019t speak each other\u2019s languages.  But my mom helped translate. I did study the main official language my grandmother spoke and also picked up her indigenous language a tiny bit. But most of the time my mom translated for us. \n\nI loved both of my grandmothers equally, and was profoundly influenced by both of them and felt I knew them and they knew me well enough.  My parents facilitated that by speaking of them all the time and speaking about me to them as often as possible. \n\nAnd this was back when we couldn\u2019t afford long distance calls very often. And my mom could only really keep in touch via letters with her mom.  We looked forward to those letters so much.\n\nI got to know my grandma through those letters and my moms stories about her years before I actually met her. By the time I met her I was already full of love for her. \n\nIf your son is so concerned about your children losing out on your presence and influence there is so much he can do to keep your presence vibrant to his children when you\u2019re not able to be there. He can reminisce about his memories of you. He can remind them of their own time spent with you.  You can do video calls and visits.  You can even write to them. They are little so they might really love post cards with simple messages.  \n\nIt\u2019s not 1823.  People do live away from their grandchildren and still manage to be a part of their lives. It does take effort, though. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s no rule that says once you\u2019re done working on the house you can\u2019t move back.  If I could have a strong relationship with a grandma I met only after I was 11, you can have one as your grandkids grow. \n\nIt\u2019s very important that you follow your heart and do what feels right for you as you work to get your life back on track after your loss.   And I am sorry for your loss. \n\nI hope you are able to forge a healthy and happy relationship with your daughter AND maintain a positive relationship with your son and his family. \n\nBut I think before you go to fix up that house, you need a little repair work on what you said to your son. And yes I know they said things they should not have, either. As you well know, upset people say awful things sometimes. \n\nGood luck to you on all of it.  I wish you the best in your new life in Colorado.", "NTA. Your aren\u2019t for wanting to move. I wouldn\u2019t even call you one for your final comment because at that point they were piling on everything they could think of to make you feel bad.  Do they depend on you for help? Childcare? Money?", "NTA \n\nYour son and DIL clearly think that you are required to be available to them at any time they demand.  They\u2019re pissed because you leaving is taking away their free child care.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad your son hates his sister.  It\u2019s also too bad that he holds her past choices/behaviors against her.\n\nYour son\u2019s an ass.  Enjoy getting to know your daughter again.", "I (23f) lost my father when I was 18. He was an expert carpenter and journeyman, and there was nothing he couldn\u2019t build, make, or fix. I was never very close with him, and we had a lot of problems when I was growing up. That said, I know, and I always knew, that he would have been my best friend once I was older. \n\nThere isn\u2019t much I wouldn\u2019t give to have been able to have him here with me to work on my house together, and to be able to have those memories in my home after his passing would have meant more than words can even describe. It would have been an opportunity to build the relationship I always hoped we would have had with each other, and I often find myself sitting in my house heartbroken that he not only never got to be part of it, but also that he never got to see me figure out what I have on my own since he isn\u2019t here. \n\nI think it\u2019s incredible that OP wants to move to help his daughter, and I agree with his decision to value his daughter and their time together over being an on call babysitter for his son. His grandkids have their parents, and getting to visit long distance grandparents is a terrific source of childhood memories for most people who don\u2019t have the luxury of living local with family. \n\nI can understand his son feeling like OP is disregarding his grandchildren, but OP is surely in pieces from his loss and he needs to take care of himself right now, without being made to feel badly for it. \n\nHopefully, he will be around long enough to still be able to have deep and meaningful relationships with his grandkids, and maybe the whole thing will help bring the entire family closer together in the end. Hopefully, the house will become an heirloom that will hold those memories to be shared with generations of family to come.", "NTA: You do realize that there\u2019ll be less contact and you should talk about if phone calls/face time would be something you\u2019d do or if a schedule works best or not.

No.  Just because your grandchildren are your world doesn't mean that they have to be op's.  Op can live where he wants to.  Destroy his son?  No, his son was the one who went there and asked that question simply to try to manipulate op into doing what he wanted him to do.  And it didn't work.  Op can't live in two places at once.", "He didn't tell his son Angie is the favorite of the two siblings. He said she was more important than his grandchildren.", "But there are ways to foster long distance relationships that your parents or grandparents obviously didn't work on in your case.

My mother has three grandkids that she loves very much, but she never wanted to be the babysitter. As their aunt that was my job. Every family is different, it does not mean OP loves his any less than you do.", "As what, a babysitter?   It's great you want to do that, but...", "He wouldn't have said it if his son hadn't asked it.  If you can't handle the answer, don't ask the question.", "Are you proud of your son?", "Unless you're moving to southern Colorado (like, way south) you aren't moving to the southwest, or anything that \"life in the southeast\" conures up.", "Colorado is AMAZING.

He also quoted the son saying she made shitty choices. This implies it was very bad and ongoing over some time, not a one off incident or two. In situations like this, it is normal for most parental attention to be diverted to the very, very troubled child making shitty decisions while the healthy child gets the crumbs. \n\nThe son has resentment and abandonment issues (which is consistent with the above) if he reacts to his dad moving away as being \"discarded\". He is quoted as saying \"Angie had her chance at childhood and it is their (his kids) turn now\". Thinking you are being discarded is such an over the top response unless you are used to being neglected for your sister. His wife also didn't talk him down to a more \"rational\" standpoint.

It would be cruel for OP to just walk. It is fully OP's responsibility to break the news to his grandkids and it's also his responsibility to maintain his relationship with them. I would be pretty pissed if one of my parents pulled this shit on my kids too. I'm fact, I do have some similar personal experience with this type of situation and it was really hard for my kids.

It\u2019s obvious that he has some pretty deep seated resentment toward his sister. I would hope that he will find a way to be supportive and look forward to your visits instead of being angry. In between your visits there\u2019s always Skype and FaceTime. Not the same but more than phone calls. \n\nI don\u2019t know where you live now and don\u2019t know what area of Colorado you\u2019re looking at but I have family in Colorado.

Besides not knowing how close you are with your grandkids and how ofthen a week/ a month you see them does matter. Kids get attatched. They will feel over the years you chose your daughter over them. If you only see them once a while it should be fine, but if you see them weekly or daily its a different story. When I was 6 years old my grandparents moved away to my dads sister, she had younger kids then me. I didnt think it effected me mutch but I was a only child and very close with my grandparents. I saw them very ofthen. A lot of things happend after they left, I got bullied in school, we moved to a mutch bigger house down the street. I did spend most vacations at my grandparents and with my cousin. It was always drama when I had to leave. You have no idea the lonelyness I felt. I think my grandpa knew. We called ofthen etc, but I do still hold some resentment towards them abandoning me and choosing to be with my cousins over me. I know it sounds selfish, but I was very close with them and to just have that ripped away. Ofcorse im described as a very sensative person, but maybe think about your grandkids and think ehat kind of relationship you want with them. You can talk with your son trough the ideas. One thing my parents and grandparents didnt do is talk to resolve issues. Communicate, talk things out and trough. You could even pull up the fact that it was your idea, that you are exited for it, but also find away to be there for your grandkids. Life is rough, but creating resentment and compleetly damige your relationships doesnt seem nessesairy. Hope this helps giving some perspective.

Just be careful that Angie and her husband don\u2019t start relying on you more than you\u2019d like though. You\u2019ve spent the last X years raising and supporting a family, this is your time now. NTA.", "Indeed.\nAnd besides, it's a wonderful bonding time to spend with his daughter also even if she is an adult.\nI'm very sure that the daughter appreciates the time she will have with her father, especially now when their mother is gone.", "Or maybe they just love him and feel a bit abandoned by him and want to keep him in their lives? Reddit always needs to jump to the worst possible motives.", "Immediately on reading the OP I wondered what the dynamic between the siblings was like! I\u2019m getting the strong impression that Erik got the shit end of the stick regularly due to his sister and now that is happening again.", "That\u2019s fair but things are also different now and it depends on the grandparents. My in laws are 2,000 miles away and my kids still have a great relationship with them. FaceTime, texting now that they\u2019re older and have phones. Flights are inflated right now but travel is more affordable than it used to be (depending on your age). It sounds like the son is more bitter about his sister \u201cgetting\u201d OP. NTA OP.", "The solution is that OP needs to be the one to break the news to the grandkids. Which tbh seems like he's already trying to avoid doing himself. Also, OP needs to take on the responsibility of maintaining his relationship with his grandkids. What does that look like? I don't know. That's his problem to figure out. Then he's responsible for communicating that to his grandkids. \n\nNone of this has anything to do with OP's son. Y'all are focusing on the wrong thing here. \n\nWhat are you talking about, when parents need to move for a job? Huh?", "Maybe he loves you and is feeling abandoned by your choice? You must realise this will impact your relationship with them and that you won\u2019t see each other as much anymore?", "Isn't the problem child usually the golden child ? I think the son is tired of give chances to the sister.", "Damn, take a breath.  First, OP\u2019s not \u201cpulling\u201d anything, he\u2019s carefully considering and openly sharing a plan for the next phase of his life. Second, children as young as as Eric\u2019s have not reached the level of cognitive development necessary to experience devastation.  Yes, OP\u2019s grandkids might miss him as much as toddlers can, but implying that they\u2019ll be overwhelmed with grief is just unnecessary.  And last, you say your kids are your world? Ok, so then there\u2019s no issue with OP wanting to be with HIS kid.", "Exactly, the sister\u2019s troubles took his parents attention away from him as a child, now he\u2019s lost his mom and his sister is again taking his the entirety of available parent attention.", "Take a breath lol. Way to go, kicking off your response with an emotionally charged way to let me know you're discounting my entire statement. Super mature. \n\nToddlers absolutely feel a range of emotions when an adult they are bonded to abandons them. Ever hear of attachment disorders? Yeah, those happen in literal infants who clearly don't understand what's happening on a cognitive level. Why are you discounting the role a grandparent can play in a child's life? Children can and do bond to grandparents very strongly. \n\nOP's \"KID\" is a fully grown adult. She is no longer a child. His grandkids are children. His adult daughter will lose nothing, but those grandkids have everything to lose. Children's needs are more important than adult's wants. And in this case? His daughter doesn't even want him to move for her. She said she she would like that but come on. It's to help her fix up a house. That's superficial as hell. If she had cancer or some other need it would be totally different. \n\nIf OP wants to drag up and leave, he's fully responsible for 1. Breaking the news to those grandkids. 2. Maintaining relationships with those grandkids including visiting them in person. FaceTime doesn't work for kids under five. They need in person interaction. 3. Communicating his plan to the son because right now it looks like OP is abandoning those kids. He's even trying to weasel out of 1. above.  \n\nKids aren't puppies or toys. And by kids, I mean literal children not fully developed adults. You can't bond with kids then just bounce. Hell even social programs like Big Brothers Big Sisters have strict requirements on becoming a mentor. You're expected to stay in your city for x number of years because you can't form those bonds with those kids then flake on them.", "I\u2019m sorry do you personally know the lives of this family? Have you been there for the front row and seen all of this unfold in person ??\n\nOh you haven\u2019t ?? Then stop pulling bullshit that has no basis out of your ass."]}
