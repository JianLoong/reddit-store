Sounds like they fear losing a free babysitter.\n\nAlso a lot of resentment of sister.", "INFO: Aside from wondering about childcare and what you're providing, I am wondering if your son and his wife have done a lot of you over the years while your daughter has been largely absent. Your wife died. Who was there for you to lean and who was there to take you in? Who helped you deal with the funeral and etc. I'm wondering if what's happening here is that your son has been there for you every day and in every way, and now you have a chance to know your daughter better, and your son may feel like you don't value him and what he's done for you. He may be very angry at Angie for not being a better daughter for you and your wife, and now it seems like all's forgiven and she did't have to do anything to get back into your good graces, while your son has worked his ass off for you and has been there for you. He may see you as dismissing him in favor of someone he sees as unworthy of you moving and helping them.", ">  is there any chance you are currently helping them a lot with childcare, and their reaction night be based on that?\n\nThat was actually my first thought: While I'm sure the thought of dad who's always been there moving away is troubling, I wonder if some of it is the loss of the built-in babysitter?", "Exactly what I was thinking as soon as I read \u201c3 kids, all under 5.\u201d", "Your statement that he owes his adult children nothing is contradictive to his motives for moving. He has guilt for his daughter making poor decisions, lack of financial stability to work on their home, and working the night shift while she was younger and missing out on her childhood.\n\nOP YTA not for moving but for what you said about your grandchildren. Just bc OP\u2019s son and daughter n law didn\u2019t process their disappointment in a healthy way doesn\u2019t justify talking about his grandchildren like that. For the same logic you used to leave them your son could just as well deny you ever seeing your grandchildren ever again because as you said they\u2019re not your children.", "I spend time with the kids, but I don't proivide childcare in any sense other than once in a while, they'll spend the night at grandpa's house.", "Yes, she was thrilled when I offered, and she has made plans for me staying in the house as we remodel. When that's finished, I'll buy a small place out there for myself.", "Yeah, I\u2019m with you on that. At first, it will be twice a year, then eventually once a year, then it will whittle down to \u201cmaybe\u201d this year, and eventually just not even go. If that is a risk he is willing to take, then so be it.", "That makes the most logical sense to me, because I understand being upset about him moving but the way they reacted (like its objectively awful and unheard of that a grandparent might not live nearby their grandkid) is not normal. At least here in the United States people certainly don't consider it an expected norm that grandparents live nearby and have very close relationships with the grandkids (especially in recent generations, where grandparents are usually still working) and I've never seen someone judge someone for not living in driving distance of their grandkids lol", "> OP YTA not for moving but for what you said about your grandchildren. Just bc OP\u2019s son and daughter n law didn\u2019t process their disappointment in a healthy way doesn\u2019t justify talking about his grandchildren like that\n\nI don't think so. He only said that after they pressed the issue. They asked if the daughter is more important than the grandkids. There is no winning answer there and the answer he gave was the honest one. I have no grandkids, but if I were pressed to choose between my kids and one of my siblings, or even my kids or my parents, I would choose the kids -- they're my kids. They're going to come second in my life, right after my wife, period.", "It isn't quite clear why your son is this upset.\n\nYou don't provide childcare. And from the way you speak about them it doesn't seem like you're very close to your grandkids even though you spend time with them. I am not seeing why Eric is upset really. Is there any other information that you think might help?", "Then NTA, your son will adjust", "Right? I mean, take the sister out of the equation and say he's moving because he really likes the that region of the US, would they feel the same way? Or flip it and say the son and his family are moving across country for a job or something: would they expect dad to move to stay near them? That would be bizarre, too. I mean, sure, some of it is going to be the feeling of 'choosing her over me/us' but it sounds like it was way out of proportion for that, unless there's a lot of backstory not provided. But I think it's a matter of losing him as a babysitter, especially since DiL reacted that way so quickly, as well.", "I in no way defended his children in my previous post. You\u2019re right there\u2019s no win win in their situation but OP still didn\u2019t have to take it that far. My statement still stands if his son never allowed him time with his grand kids for his statement they\u2019re just as much in the right for him making his statement that they\u2019re not his kids. He\u2019s essentially saying he has no obligation to be in their life because they\u2019re not his children. \n\nYou are right your spouse comes first, then kids, and finally extended family. But pick up the slack for your adult children is a moral choice not an obligation, it begs the question at what point do your kids need to grow up and take responsibility for their actions.", "Right, but again, he didn't say his daughter is more important than his grandkids until his son forced him to. There were three options there: \"Yes, she is\", \"No, she isn't\", or \"That's a ridiculous question I'm not going to answer.\" The first and the last would be seen as the same response by the son and the middle one would be weaponized by the son.", "NTA. You're feeling lost since your wife passed, and you now have the opportunity to help your daughter rehab her home. This will be good for YOU. Your son is only considering the time you won't spend with his children, not all the time you've already spent with them, which your daughter hasn't had all these years. He isn't considering your feelings or future. Regardless of how he feels about your daughter, he should be happy that you are choosing to do something that will give you some direction rather than being lost. Maybe talking to him about how you're feeling and how this opportunity will help you and not focusing on your daughter will help him understand where you're coming from. Go and enjoy helping your daughter build her home and getting to know her and her husband better, and plan trips to visit your son and his family a few times a year.", "NTA. You are an adult with your own life and identity. That identity is not just \u201cgrandpa and free babysitter.\u201d If you wanted to move to an island and drink Mojitos on the beach, it would still be a valid reason.

How is moving affecting him ? I\u2019m confused", "NTA (it would be N A H but your son and DIL'S reactions were too much. Disappointment is one thing, rage is a different one). I think your son probably doesn't like your daughter very much due to their history/her past actions.

Your son may want you there for the kids (interestingly not for him or his wife, tho?), but it's always been a possibility you could move. I mean, places like FL are known for snowbirds. Your son's wants ultimately do not overrule your own, and he should've realized that before he used his own values to determine where they'd raise the kids. Maybe he feels hurt about that, too. But, there are phones and computers now. You guys can write emails and call and Facetime and then meet up during summer or something! Lots of people grow up not living right next to their grandparents and they turned out okay. You will all be fine once everyone's had time to cool off, I think.\n\nPersonally, my grandma did stay where she was for her grandkids and to some degree she regrets it now because she lives in a big house they grew up in all alone since my grandpa died. It's lonely and tough over time. Do what is right for you.", "NTA It's your life and you get to choose how and where to live it.  By any chance are you the FREE babysitter?

He must understand his kids though are your grand kids are important to him just like your  kids are important to you.

He was a straight A, scholarship student who ended up with a free ride to school, majored in engineering, bought a house within his first year at work, etc. He is very buttoned up and serious and doesn't have time for anything he perceives as foolish. \n\nSo he perceives his sister's life as being a \"trainwreck\" because she didn't do well in school, struggled with work after graduating, had a string of bad relationships, etc. He doesn't have a high opinion of her.", "This is a very negative read of a lot of positive personality traits. It sounds like your son worked very hard to get where he is while your daughter didn\u2019t, yet she gets all the help from dad while your son doesn\u2019t. I would be upset too.", "NTA. Above being a father and a grandfather, you are an individual person. You have every right to live the life you choose.", "NTA your kids ARE more important than your grandchildren. Eric and his wife just need to come to terms with you moving away. You can have some nice long visits with them throughout each year, which will be really exciting for the kids.", "NTA. I think that's really unfair of your son and DIL. Moving away is not discarding your grandkids. Growing up I was always closer to my grandparents who lived on the other side of the country over my grandparents who lived in the same town. You can still have a great relationship with your grandkids. \n\nAnd my parents moved away from where my brother and his three kids live. But never did he or his wife view it as abandoning their kids. Because it's just not fair or realistic to dictate where grandparents chose to live, there can be a million reasons to move. And my parents are still Souper close with my nieces and nephew. \n\nAre your son and daughter-in-law upset about losing you as a childcare option? Is it possible your son feels like your daughter has always gotten more attention because she was troubled? Maybe he sees this as you picking her over him again and he's just saying it's about the grandkids? I just feel like there has to be more going on because lots of grandparents don't live by their grandkids and still have good relationships with them", "NTA- This is a heartbreaking position to be in.", "NTA. Eric can find another babysitter. You aren't those kids' parents, but you are one of  Angie's parents. Eric is using his children as a tactic to keep you around for free childcare, but please OP go find a hobby or something to do, it's time to tell Eric and his wife that you aren't a free babysitter. Your daughter should have your support.", "NTA they're probably not upset that you chose your daughter, its more likely that they're upset that a potential babysitter is moving away.", "I think your son and his wife are more upset that you won't be around to help them out with their kids, such as babysitting and paying for things, etc.  NTA.", "If anything, your son sounds more upset about losing another adult to parent his kids.", "Only thing that would make YTA is how you raised Eric. He has turned out to be entitled and spoiled.", "NTA. Personally, I think it's a risky idea to move there with the plan of helping them fix their house. You don't know how well y'all will get along once you're spending lots of time together - and you're presumably 'bossing' them around a bit (since you're the one who knows what to do). Moving for the sake of a relationship puts a lot of pressure on that relationship. IMO, it would be better to have a trial run before you pick up and move. \n\nThat being said, it's **your** decision, and your son and DIL are acting ridiculously entitled. Your grandchildren are not the only important thing in your life, and moving doesn't mean abandoning them anyway.", "NTA- I think it\u2019s great that you want to move out of state to start new and help your daughter out. Do you think from your some perspective that maybe it\u2019s too much change too soon for him? His mom died and now his dad is moving far away. Maybe he is just having a hard time letting go of having both his parents around. Hopefully he doesn\u2019t actually think that way about his sister but maybe she\u2019s just an easy target to direct his anger at the moment.", "NTA. Hope the relocate to be with your daughter works out really well for you all.", "NAH.\n\nYou don't say that you are used a lot as a babysitter, so I'm not going to assume that is the reason that your son and daughter in law want you around.  It would be hard to explain to three small children why their grandfather is suddenly not there.  At the same time, you need to do what is best for you.  Are you able to afford frequent trips back to visit the grandkids?  Are you willing to set up some facetime traditions?  A friend of mine read a bedtime story to her out of state grandson every single night for 5 years until she finally moved close to him - you don't have to do an every day thing, but think about how you're going to stay close with your grandchildren, and share those plans with your son.\n\nAnd give him some grace over his anger.  He's upset on behalf of his children.", "NTA. My parents in their retirement had an RV. They would spend 1/2 the year in San Diego where my sister and their grandchild lived and 1/2 the year in Iowa where my older sister and I live. They both were born and lived in Iowa their whole lives prior to this. When my dad got sick they stayed in Iowa. He passed in 2015. My mom decided to stay in Iowa as she was more comfortable driving here and had her doctors that she likes here. She goes out to see my sister\u2019s family often. My nephew calls her all the time. There are multiple ways to keep in touch with family now. Your moving won\u2019t take away from you being a grandparent.", "NTA. Your wife died, you feel lost.

Good call.", "To be fair to this guy, i have kids and I don\u2019t expect my parents to babysit but I do want them in my children\u2019s lives, just spending time all of us together.

But there are ways to express that that don't involve lashing out and making shitty jabs at his sister for having struggled in her life.\n\nMy mom actually did the inverse of this a couple years ago. She'd lived in California for 40ish years, raised me and my brother here. My brother went into the military, spent some time stationed in Colorado, and loved it there. So, when he left the military, he and his wife and their new baby moved there and bought a house. When my niece was about 18 months old, my mom broached the topic to me of her moving to CO and living near my brother and his family. And, ngl, it kinda stung that she would rather be near them.\n\nBut it's not a competition. I didn't need to shit on my brother's life choices in reaction to my own hurt. I reassured my mom that I, a grown ass adult with a good job and a partner, would be fine without my mommy living 5 minutes away, and I understood her wanting to be near them. I was the one who packed her up and drove shifts so she and her cats could make the trip without an overnight stop.\n\nSo I understand OP's son being hurt. I miss my mom way more than I had expected to, tbh. I get that feeling of hurt. But his reaction was over the top and cruel to his sister, which makes him still TA here.", "It sounds like Angie had been a bit of a \u201cscrew up\u201d, and maybe had gotten more of her parents attention over the years as a result. It can be hard to be the other sibling in a dynamic like that because it feels like you\u2019re never the priority. Like one the one hand Yes it\u2019s understandable that the one who needs more help gets more, but on the other seeing your sibling get all this  extra help can feel a bit like being punished for being the responsible one. And in this case Dad isn\u2019t just going to be giving more help but is actually *moving away* from his other child.", "That's pretty shitty though. You would punish the kid that did well for being less needy. It should be the opposite - achievement should be rewarded.", "I get it, I love my nieces to bits and they are the best part of life most days.

This could feel like both of his parents are gone now.", "No, her struggle was in part because she didn't receive the attention or care that she could have benefitting from.", "This is an interesting perspective that I don't think I quite understand. With this perspective, leaving home and going off on her own was a negative thing that we should have felt bad about, and Eric staying was a positive thing we should have rewarded?", "Yep. My money is on the good son feeling resentment to the prodigal one.", "That's kinda true, Angie made her own bed when she left, so she deserves less attention. That is a natural consequence of her own decision. Eric obviously cares for OP's attention more than Angie, but OP cares more about getting closer to daughter than staying close to son.\n\nDid OP even tell Eric he will miss him and he can visit whenever he wants? Or did he just say \"you had the last 17 years, get over it?\"", "No, Angie leaving home does not reflect negatively on her, or you. This is not about making value judgments, it's about giving each of your kids what they need, and it sounds like they have different love languages.\n\nAngie leaving and being happy in her new life indicates she doesn't need you emotionally or physically, as much as Eric does. \n\nBottom line, Angie doesn't actually need you for her house. You offered, she accepted, but she would be fine without you. But it sounds like Eric needs you around for emotional reasons, which you are discounting bc they are not physical needs, and also because you have been closer to Eric for longer. \n\nSo, you're not really doing this for Angie; you're doing this for you. You are chasing her love in a way you never chased Eric's. Even when Eric said out loud it would hurt him if you left, you still wanted to leave. So yeah, that's gonna hurt Eric.\n\nEdit: I forgot to talk about potential resolutions. Maybe you can go on visits to help your daughter, but not completely move away from your son. Or, is it feasible for you to live half the year in one location, and the other half in another? \n\nYou should also probably tell Eric that just because you're moving away doesn't mean you won't be there for him. Take the initiative to call, facetime the kids, visit, invite them up, etc.", "How long is OP supposed to punish her for? How long is he supposed to make her face the natural consequences of her behavior?  I don\u2019t see it as he cares more about getting close to his daughter than staying close to his son.

She has very little experience, and while she picks up on these things easily, she still has admitted multiple times that she has no idea what she's doing.

It's a little weird.", "It's not a punishment to the daughter to not go to her. She didn't even ask dad to go, she just said yes when he offered. \n\nI don't think Angie is a bad person or less deserving of love. Love isn't the same as attention and proximity. Angie moved away and created a life where she doesn't need proximity from her parents. \n\nEric otoh, created a life that put his parents in a central role - one with honor and respect. Eric seems to value the attention and proximity, as evidenced by his reaction. His mother dying changed Eric's life way more than Angie's because he is used to the proximity. Now OP is abandoning him too, not because his sister needs him, but because he wants to bond more with her. \n\nThat I think is what stings the most - it's not OP choosing daughter's needs over son's needs. It's OP desiring a bond with daughter more than he wants to nurture his bond with his son. It's about what OP wants, and of course it would hurt to know your dad wants a relationship with the sibling who left more than with the one who stayed. \n\nLove is not a zero sum game; but attention and proximity are. You can't get more without giving some up somewhere else.", "No one is making anything up, we're just seeing it from Eric's point of view. Even now, your entire reply is about Angie, and not a word about any of the stuff I said about Eric.", "Eric also got OPs presence in his formative years which Angie did not.  Angie missed out on having her dad around because he was working night shifts.\n\nIt also sounds like OP is doing this for himself. There is nothing wrong with him choosing to do something that is good for himself and his daughter.   He probably spend a few hours every few weeks with Eric and his family.  Because Eric doesn\u2019t need his help, and doesn\u2019t need him directly involved, that is unlikely to change.

People above say it\u2019s child care, so who here is right? Both of my grandfathers were dead by the time I was born so honestly they should be happy to meet their grandfather at all, so there\u2019s my bit of personal projection onto this scenario. He\u2019s not abandoning his child. His child is a grown man with children that will miss gramps for a bit and be over it in a couple of months.\n\nEric and his family could move one day. Would it be different if it was them leaving grandpa behind? Should Eric\u2019s family always remain where they are because grandpa lives nearby? Some people do that but many don\u2019t. People spread out.", "My son worked very hard to get where he is, and my daughter did as well. They had very different experiences growing up. I'm not sure where you're getting the idea that she gets \"all the help\" while my son doesn't. She moved out to Colorado nearly 2 decades ago. There's only so much help to offer from afar."]}
