At that point, his wife got home and joined the pile-on, talking about how she\u2019s shocked any grandparent would make this choice. Eric said that what, is Angie more important than his kids? And I said damn right she is, she\u2019s my daughter.

They won't lose their chance of a childhood because one of their grandparents has moved away. Does he really mean that he's missing out on a free, convenient babysitter?", "NTA. Your son doesn't get to dictate where you live. Don't let him weaponize those kids.", "NTA\n\nYour life does not revolve around Eric - you made this choice and whether or not he chooses to support you in it is out of your control. Eric may be feeling hurt though, considering it sounds like your wife's passing is fairly recent, this may feel like he's losing you too given how far away you're moving. You need to do what is best for you though. Hopefully Eric can come to see this, and understand.

Your son did overreact too much and bring up her past was not a good thing because she has changed and that\u2019s because she found her place and you and her want to rekindle the love you both never really got to experience.

I live close to my mom but my sibling lives far away. I'd be so upset if she moved. HOWEVER, that would be her choice and we're all adults. Cruelty and manipulation is unnecessary.", "OP=nta\n\nDo you babysit a lot? Sounds like they fear losing a free babysitter.\n\nAlso a lot of resentment of sister.", "INFO: Aside from wondering about childcare and what you're providing, I am wondering if your son and his wife have done a lot of you over the years while your daughter has been largely absent. Your wife died. Who was there for you to lean and who was there to take you in? Who helped you deal with the funeral and etc. I'm wondering if what's happening here is that your son has been there for you every day and in every way, and now you have a chance to know your daughter better, and your son may feel like you don't value him and what he's done for you. He may be very angry at Angie for not being a better daughter for you and your wife, and now it seems like all's forgiven and she did't have to do anything to get back into your good graces, while your son has worked his ass off for you and has been there for you. He may see you as dismissing him in favor of someone he sees as unworthy of you moving and helping them.", ">  is there any chance you are currently helping them a lot with childcare, and their reaction night be based on that?\n\nThat was actually my first thought: While I'm sure the thought of dad who's always been there moving away is troubling, I wonder if some of it is the loss of the built-in babysitter?", "Exactly what I was thinking as soon as I read \u201c3 kids, all under 5.\u201d", "Your statement that he owes his adult children nothing is contradictive to his motives for moving. He has guilt for his daughter making poor decisions, lack of financial stability to work on their home, and working the night shift while she was younger and missing out on her childhood.\n\nOP YTA not for moving but for what you said about your grandchildren. Just bc OP\u2019s son and daughter n law didn\u2019t process their disappointment in a healthy way doesn\u2019t justify talking about his grandchildren like that. For the same logic you used to leave them your son could just as well deny you ever seeing your grandchildren ever again because as you said they\u2019re not your children.", "I spend time with the kids, but I don't proivide childcare in any sense other than once in a while, they'll spend the night at grandpa's house.", "Yes, she was thrilled when I offered, and she has made plans for me staying in the house as we remodel. When that's finished, I'll buy a small place out there for myself.", "Yeah, I\u2019m with you on that. At first, it will be twice a year, then eventually once a year, then it will whittle down to \u201cmaybe\u201d this year, and eventually just not even go. If that is a risk he is willing to take, then so be it.", "That makes the most logical sense to me, because I understand being upset about him moving but the way they reacted (like its objectively awful and unheard of that a grandparent might not live nearby their grandkid) is not normal. At least here in the United States people certainly don't consider it an expected norm that grandparents live nearby and have very close relationships with the grandkids (especially in recent generations, where grandparents are usually still working) and I've never seen someone judge someone for not living in driving distance of their grandkids lol", "> OP YTA not for moving but for what you said about your grandchildren. Just bc OP\u2019s son and daughter n law didn\u2019t process their disappointment in a healthy way doesn\u2019t justify talking about his grandchildren like that\n\nI don't think so. He only said that after they pressed the issue. They asked if the daughter is more important than the grandkids. There is no winning answer there and the answer he gave was the honest one. I have no grandkids, but if I were pressed to choose between my kids and one of my siblings, or even my kids or my parents, I would choose the kids -- they're my kids. They're going to come second in my life, right after my wife, period.", "It isn't quite clear why your son is this upset.\n\nYou don't provide childcare. And from the way you speak about them it doesn't seem like you're very close to your grandkids even though you spend time with them. I am not seeing why Eric is upset really. Is there any other information that you think might help?", "Then NTA, your son will adjust", "Right? I mean, take the sister out of the equation and say he's moving because he really likes the that region of the US, would they feel the same way? Or flip it and say the son and his family are moving across country for a job or something: would they expect dad to move to stay near them? That would be bizarre, too. I mean, sure, some of it is going to be the feeling of 'choosing her over me/us' but it sounds like it was way out of proportion for that, unless there's a lot of backstory not provided. But I think it's a matter of losing him as a babysitter, especially since DiL reacted that way so quickly, as well.", "I in no way defended his children in my previous post. You\u2019re right there\u2019s no win win in their situation but OP still didn\u2019t have to take it that far. My statement still stands if his son never allowed him time with his grand kids for his statement they\u2019re just as much in the right for him making his statement that they\u2019re not his kids. He\u2019s essentially saying he has no obligation to be in their life because they\u2019re not his children. \n\nYou are right your spouse comes first, then kids, and finally extended family. But pick up the slack for your adult children is a moral choice not an obligation, it begs the question at what point do your kids need to grow up and take responsibility for their actions.", "Right, but again, he didn't say his daughter is more important than his grandkids until his son forced him to. There were three options there: \"Yes, she is\", \"No, she isn't\", or \"That's a ridiculous question I'm not going to answer.\" The first and the last would be seen as the same response by the son and the middle one would be weaponized by the son."]}
