If it is off, then try to go to your respective corners and take a break and after a few days, express how you feel about the relationship and what you hope to get out of it.

It is also easier to stick with the known than leap into the unknown.

Have fun being downvoted", "bro just say you\u2019re cheating on your girl", "Bro is gunning for negative karma", "You're being down voted, and this is probably the closest it gets to the situation. ESH is the correct response. The hive mind that so many people on Reddit have is ridiculous.", "Yeah, whether he will find those conversations with my friend interesting is another story. I generally don\u2019t write anything in a text that I would be horrified with someone seeing.", "I\u2019m thinking the bf or someone in a similar situation", "Nope.  We respect each other's privacy. 23 years, junior. \n\nLots of white knights in here. \n\nSHE'S NOT GOING TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU!!!", "Yes you can chose with whom you are together ?!?? I mean perhabs she was forced but doesnt sound like that. \n\nI mean i dont expect much from crazychickenlady223 but yeah.", "Until you find out he\u2019s been in someone else\u2019s box", "But aren't you keeping someone else's nudes without their consent?  The only person you could show it to without breaching the sender's privacy would be the ex-bf, and you don't owe him proof of anything.", "I\u2019m not sure why you would need proof? Unless you\u2019re married and expecting a bitter divorce. I\u2019m not even sure you need proof of infidelity then..", "I mean ESH is an option.", "Lmao I thought the same. He's been commenting on nearly every post that says NTA.", "Looks like it.... lots of responding with the same response.", "Yeah, I couldn't care less. They can downvote me all they want. I know I'm right.", "Oh fuck I\u2019m so sorry for your wife", "Obviously you can choose who you're with but sometimes people change and do things you don't and can't predict \"Usual-Leopard9102\"", "She\u2019s not an asshole for trusting her gut feelings and finding out she\u2019s being cheated on. Y\u2019all are so focused on her going through his phone for what?\n\nBeen there done that, found out I was being cheated on. Dumped him, never looked back. And I\u2019d do it again if I felt like my partner was hiding shit", "Comment got deleted but I'm curious, could you summarize the comments please? :D", "Hey, he\u2019s an Alpha Male ok? That\u2019s how he keeps his wife in line.", "Ok, millenial.  YTA", "The only storys i believe are plausible are ultra rare circumstances with things like someone getting a stroke and chance from one day to the other. Or some extreme cases like psychosis sure. \n\nBut in most cases in reality people will see it and ignore it or hope for the best. I too of course ! Its not like i didnt had relationships where i completly knew it was wrong and not okay but clinged to it because i thought they will chance.\n\nThe \"its not your fault\" was the worst people could told me. Because it took my autonomie away. \"i cant do anything i just can hope i get treated right\". But the moment i understood \"no its my fault....that means i can chance it i need to take care of myself and dont let people treat me bad...\" yeah that moment it worked fine for me.", "what a fuckin idiot you are \ud83d\ude02"]}
