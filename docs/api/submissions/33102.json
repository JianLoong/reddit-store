You even asked them to stop and they continued. \n\nOn a side note and I mean no disrespect but may I ask your background, all 3 of you have very large families at very young ages.", "NTA \u2014 sounds like your sister and law and brother don\u2019t know how to parent and you removed your children from a toxic situation. You did what I would do. I would have a chat with the parents and explain what you are and are not okay with when all of your kids are together and when you will remove your children from situations. You did the right thing, mama!", "Why did you not pull your sister aside earlier and tell her to parent her children, or get them away from your children? Maybe after the first racist comment? Or the sexist comment? A bunch of moments you could have brought this to her directly.", "NTA. I wouldn't want my kids around such ill-behaved children and I wouldn't want to be around parents who don't correct the bad behavior.", "BTA, your siblings are much older than you and their kids are older than your kids. Which means parenting strategies are going to be much different. Magic words and other toddler parenting tactics aren\u2019t always applicable to pre teens. \n\nI think once emotions settle down the reality is that while you should not parent their children, their kids ruined your mood with their shitty behavior. \n\nLesson learned, don\u2019t go on a family outing in that type of scenario in the future. I would offer to consider spending time alone with your siblings the next couple times you get together to reestablish a healthy connection before bringing kids back into the mix. However, you may not want their children teaching your littles this type of crudeness", "NTA. While it may not be the comfortable thing to do correcting someone for blatant racism or sexism is okay. Although I will say the sexism one was probably more of a joke like the \u201cboys go to Jupiter to get more stupider\u201d thing we said it school. It may be uncomfortable to step in and parent sometimes but it can be necessary. \n\nAn example from my life was in highschool after baseball practice I ate with my mom my friend and his mom and my friend said 3 or 4 very rude comments about / to his mom that even made my eyes open wide and my mom absolutely laid into his ass. The difference is he realized he was wrong and apologized to both his mom and my mom", "ESH\n\n> I am currently 3 months pregnant with our 4th kid\n\n> Carl had 5 kids\n\n> Amy has 7\n\n#\\*TOO MANY\\* KIDS", "Your sister's family sounds like a lot to deal with, but you probably should've had a talk with her before you yelled at them.
