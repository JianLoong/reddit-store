Our culture doesn't have the usual bridesmaid/groomsmen thing, but close friends of the bride and groom usually help out. The bride, Alicia and I go way back. We have been friends since high school, and have been through a lot together. However, my relationship with her hasn't always been the best, as she was essentially a mean girl in school and treated me terribly. We both were part of a group of 6, and they all made me the scapegoat for all their mean jokes, comments and amusement. I was trolled for being tall and chubby. They would treat me and talk to me like I was a guy, and it seriously hurt my self esteem for a long time. However, the reason I put up with it back then was because I didn't have any other choice and they were always there when I needed help, which made it easier to brush off their behaviour. \n\nI have been low contact with them for a while now, and haven't seen any of them in person for at least a year. This has helped me gain some confidence. I've lost weight and feel more comfortable wearing short clothes. Alicia contacted me a while ago to ask me to be in her wedding. I hesitated at first, but she insisted and expressed how important it was to her that I be there. So I agreed, and we all met up. In the first few minutes of meeting up, Alicia expressed how shocked she was at how much I'd changed. She said she'd seen my pictures on social media, but assumed that I'd photoshopped them like I used to in school to look slim. 2 other friends nodded their approval, and said they thought the same thing. Then Alicia says that she's surprised that I actually look like a girl. This kind of hurt, but I calmly replied telling her that I am a girl. She just laughed and said that I'd always be a boy to her because no matter how much weight I lost, she'd still be more petite due to the height difference. As if this wasn't enough, she turned towards one of the guys from our group and asked him for his opinion on this. He chuckled and said that she's still the small and cute one. I somehow swallowed this all down, and tried to proceed further by changing the topic, but Alicia would not let me. She kept passing comments on my gender identity, body type and style of dressing. I finally snapped when she told me that she expected me to wear a suit to her wedding instead of a dress. There is no way I was doing that, and I made that clear, but she was adamant, saying that it was her wedding and she wanted me to adhere to her vision. She said she liked that I was different in school and wore men's clothing, and my new style really threw her off, so she just wanted to fondly remember the old days by having me dress up like a boy. \n\nI could not believe how mean and ridiculous she was being, so I told her to count me out and promptly walked out. Since then, the entire group has contacted me to tell me that I'm being unnecessarily stubborn and hurting Alicia.\n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1672663891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101bw9r/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_friends_wedding/", "score": 1769, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For years I put up with being treated poorly by my so-called 'friends'.  I struggled to make friends so it was easier to put up with their behavior than to venture outside my comfort zone.  Eventually I realized I'd rather be alone than miserable in their company.  This allowed me to break away from them, find people that I had things in common with, and build a life without them.  They were not happy about this and kept trying to push their way back into my life, even using my family, who had no idea of what was going on, to help them.  Turns out, they couldn't stand the fact that I was happy and flourishing without them.  It's been years now since I had anything to do with them, I don't even follow them on social media.
