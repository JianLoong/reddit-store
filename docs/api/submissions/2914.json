There's only ever 5 people including the two of us at Thanksgiving B.\n\nThis year I told my wife that we should just ask her mom to come to my aunt's Thanksgiving. She could easily accommodate because she has a big house with lots of table space. Also, my uncle and her stepdad would 100% get along because they like all the same stuff. Plus we've been married for a while. Might be a good time to start integrating the fams!\n\nMy wife said she didn't want to invite them because they've always been doing Thanksgiving that way, and that she thinks it might overwhelm them to be at such a big event. I kept pushing the matter, since I figure it's worth a shot and just pitching the idea isn't going to hurt. If her mom ends up saying no, then we'll forget about it. My wife got mad about it and said I'd be putting her in an awkward spot, but I disagree.\n\nCan I count on you all to give me feedback?\n\nEDIT: Good news, everyone! I took a suggestion from some of the commenters and said that I wouldn't be attending my wife's mom's Thanksgiving this year. She has now relented and allowed me to invite them.\n\nEDIT 2: Aunt said yes. Wife's Mom said yes.

Not everyone is comfortable at large family gatherings, especially when it is someone else's family - even if the individuals involved would get along under other circumstances. Her family probably already feels like they are the \"less fun\" option or that you and your wife would rather just spend the holidays with your family. You might think inviting them to your family's Thanksgiving is you being inclusive, but they may take it as their Thanksgiving is second choice or even a burden. \n\nThey might also LIKE their small gathering! Your wife might also like seeing her family without it being part of your family's celebration.  \n\nIf you want to get the families together, do so at a non-major holiday and on neutral ground (like your house) and do it a bit at a time so her family is not constantly outnumbered.

If you can get her to give you a reason, great, but just listen to her - don't immediately try to come up with a solution.  My guess is that it's your wife who doesn't want to mix the parties.  Maybe she really just likes the vibe of her smaller family gathering and doesn't want to muddy the waters - that's good enough and should be left alone.

Not because you asked to integrate the dinners. That's a good idea. You're the asshole because you kept pushing. She said no. Drop it.

You made a suggestion, your wife said no. That was your signal to drop it. Instead you pressed and pressed until she got mad at you, then your response was to double down and say \u201cwell then I\u2019m not going to your thanksgiving at all\u201d. Jesus dude, you sound exhausting.", "YTA for trying to change her mind. Asking is reasonable, but she said no. You could come up with alternative solutions (she goes to her family and you go to yours; you alternate years of whose family you visit), but you asked her an opinion question and then decided it's only her mother's opinion that matters. Why don't you value your wife's feelings on this? She doesn't want to juggle two family dynamics at one holiday, you got your answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: If what you're missing is reasons *why* your wife feels this way, it's obviously best to ask her. But in my family, I know my mother would be offended if I even suggested moving our small Thanksgiving from her house to someone else's - she would take it personally that I'm calling her Thanksgiving less impressive or less good than someone else's (even though that's not the intention). I also completely fear my partner and my families eating together for a holiday because my mother is rather closed minded. She won't like that his family eats with their hands (cultural differences), they won't have anything in common to talk about, and then *I'll* feel weirdly stuck in the middle like I'm not being a good enough daughter to my mother or to MIL. Alternating or driving to both is always my favorite solution.", "YTA. Why you want her to ditch her tradition in favor of yours? Why not just go her family first, for quiet family time?

Also, I don't see the will here, to help her, just to force your say. \n\nWhy don't you make a dinner (any other day, not TG) and invite her family and some of yours, to meet first?

We don't know her exact reasons, but maybe she enjoys ending the evening with the small gathering, maybe she enjoys going from the massive gathering to the small one she feels more relaxed there, and it is her family and she feels more comfortable there, and while to you it is a burden, for her it is a relief. You asked her, she said no, I think you should drop it.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I kept pushing the matter,\" ... asking her ONCE was fine, pushing makes you the AH.", "is alternating between families not an option? most people do that", "Holy heck the edit.

And frankly I'm having a similar issue with Thanksgiving. At the beginning we would switch which in laws got us for which holidays. For example one year my wife's family would get us Thanksgiving then my family would get us Christmas. Then the next year it would be my family that got us Thanksgiving and my wife's family that got us Christmas. Except, what ended up happening is my wife gets us 2 holidays out of the year, and in the time we've been married my family has only got us Christmas and only once on Thanksgiving. This year's especially hard since my family is moving cross country and my wife doesn't want tk spend it alone but refuses to budge on spending Thanksgiving with her family, despite us spending Christmas with them too. It would mean so much if we could just spend one last holiday together as a family but if I bring it up she gets defensive and accused me of being a controlling A hole. Honestly it's got me drained mentally. Anyway let me know how you made it work and I'll give it a try", "NTA. Not like it\u2019s a lifetime commitment to this way.", "YTA for pushing and then asking behind her back. Maybe your wife ENJOYED getting some time with her small family gathering but didn't want to offend you.", "I think he did it right. Involve everyone.", "NTA. A big gathering is best, especially if you're not the host. You'd be surprised what a relief it is to not have to prepare a huge meal for a small group. It's much easier to add a couple people to a large group.\n\nSome people will disagree, but sometimes having a large group is less stressful than a smaller one. There's a point you cross in preparation where it just doesn't matter anymore and you don't sweat the same details, whereas if it's an intimate gathering of less than 10, you're looking at every minute detail and stressing about whether the conversation is progressing, etc. 25 or more (my family often had 30+ people) and who cares? It's too big to fail.", "YTA Even though apparently it's resolved. You assumed your aunt would be OK with it & took it upon yourself to ask wife to invite her fam without checking with your aunt first. It doesn't matter how many people are at a holiday gathering. Some families are smaller than others. Family gatherings are special no matter how big or little. If you know you're going to eat at 2 places, it's not that difficult to control your portions at the first house so you're not feeling stuffed at the 2nd house. Or go to her family's house for dessert only. You sound like you just want what you want.", "Nth for asking at all...
