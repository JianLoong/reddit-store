There's only ever 5 people including the two of us at Thanksgiving B.\n\nThis year I told my wife that we should just ask her mom to come to my aunt's Thanksgiving. She could easily accommodate because she has a big house with lots of table space. Also, my uncle and her stepdad would 100% get along because they like all the same stuff. Plus we've been married for a while. Might be a good time to start integrating the fams!\n\nMy wife said she didn't want to invite them because they've always been doing Thanksgiving that way, and that she thinks it might overwhelm them to be at such a big event. I kept pushing the matter, since I figure it's worth a shot and just pitching the idea isn't going to hurt. If her mom ends up saying no, then we'll forget about it. My wife got mad about it and said I'd be putting her in an awkward spot, but I disagree.\n\nCan I count on you all to give me feedback?\n\nEDIT: Good news, everyone! I took a suggestion from some of the commenters and said that I wouldn't be attending my wife's mom's Thanksgiving this year. She has now relented and allowed me to invite them.\n\nEDIT 2: Aunt said yes. Wife's Mom said yes.

Not everyone is comfortable at large family gatherings, especially when it is someone else's family - even if the individuals involved would get along under other circumstances. Her family probably already feels like they are the \"less fun\" option or that you and your wife would rather just spend the holidays with your family. You might think inviting them to your family's Thanksgiving is you being inclusive, but they may take it as their Thanksgiving is second choice or even a burden. \n\nThey might also LIKE their small gathering! Your wife might also like seeing her family without it being part of your family's celebration.  \n\nIf you want to get the families together, do so at a non-major holiday and on neutral ground (like your house) and do it a bit at a time so her family is not constantly outnumbered.

If you can get her to give you a reason, great, but just listen to her - don't immediately try to come up with a solution.  My guess is that it's your wife who doesn't want to mix the parties.

You made a suggestion, your wife said no. That was your signal to drop it. Instead you pressed and pressed until she got mad at you, then your response was to double down and say \u201cwell then I\u2019m not going to your thanksgiving at all\u201d. Jesus dude, you sound exhausting.", "YTA for trying to change her mind. Asking is reasonable, but she said no. You could come up with alternative solutions (she goes to her family and you go to yours; you alternate years of whose family you visit), but you asked her an opinion question and then decided it's only her mother's opinion that matters. Why don't you value your wife's feelings on this? She doesn't want to juggle two family dynamics at one holiday, you got your answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: If what you're missing is reasons *why* your wife feels this way, it's obviously best to ask her. But in my family, I know my mother would be offended if I even suggested moving our small Thanksgiving from her house to someone else's - she would take it personally that I'm calling her Thanksgiving less impressive or less good than someone else's (even though that's not the intention). I also completely fear my partner and my families eating together for a holiday because my mother is rather closed minded. She won't like that his family eats with their hands (cultural differences), they won't have anything in common to talk about, and then *I'll* feel weirdly stuck in the middle like I'm not being a good enough daughter to my mother or to MIL. Alternating or driving to both is always my favorite solution.", "YTA. Why you want her to ditch her tradition in favor of yours? Why not just go her family first, for quiet family time?

Also, I don't see the will here, to help her, just to force your say. \n\nWhy don't you make a dinner (any other day, not TG) and invite her family and some of yours, to meet first?

We don't know her exact reasons, but maybe she enjoys ending the evening with the small gathering, maybe she enjoys going from the massive gathering to the small one she feels more relaxed there, and it is her family and she feels more comfortable there, and while to you it is a burden, for her it is a relief. You asked her, she said no, I think you should drop it.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I kept pushing the matter,\" ... asking her ONCE was fine, pushing makes you the AH.", "is alternating between families not an option? most people do that", "Holy heck the edit.

So I'll do both.", "It's not.", "obviously, she didnt know her family all that well considering their response", "NTA\n\nThings change and traditions do too. Once the first year of being a couple passed I was unwilling to fling myself all over the city to accommodate every family member each holiday. Another option would be to split up for Thanksgiving or alternate based on years. No one should feel obligated to do two Thanksgivings on one day. That\u2019s another option - celebrate one on a different day.", "It truly doesn\u2019t hurt to ask and if they are all so fragile that aren\u2019t able to respond to a question then that is the bigger issue here.", "You should just alternate each year.It is what my parents did while I was growing up for Christmas (I\u2019m a Brit so no thanksgiving) and everyone was happy. Equally could you not just have set holidays like go to your aunts for thanksgiving and go to your wife\u2019s mums for Christmas? (If you celebrate Christmas)", "And the \"permission to ask\" is no.\n\nShe knows her family best.

No reason to ask aunt to accommodate additional people if wife isn't interested in asking her family to do so.", "Didn't I explain the logic to you already?", "I don't really think that's the insult you were hoping it would be.", "What? Are you assuming I wasn't planning on talking to my aunt at all? Why?", "Or OP can just eat less at his families event and ask his wife to drive between the two houses", "Dude stop going around telling me how much to eat.", "It sounds like your suggestion is worth discussing, and your wife\u2019s reaction does not add up. It is probably nothing significant, but I get the feeling there is more to this than what your wife is telling.", "Honestly there\u2019s no place like home for thanksgiving with your own home vibe and traditions. I had an outgoing huge family and my husbands was very small and quiet but I would not have asked that of them. They would have been less comfortable so we went to both with our kids. I think you are being selfish.", "It's still a question. A suggestion would be \"you should just alternate\".", "I never suggested your wife was an introvert.

It\u2019s entirely possible to like your husband\u2019s family and also like small gatherings with your own family.

I have loop ear plugs to help manage the sound aspects and I take something to keep my hands busy.  We also agreed a safeword for when it gets too much for me so he knows we need to leave.

It's her house after all. But it's just my thinking. I never ask someone to come over and then ask my family if they would be ok with it. What if they say \"no\"? Kinda sucks to get back and tell them the invitation is not valid. But I live in EU, we might have different customs.", "Care to point where and the time of that answer?

I wouldn't even entertain the idea or discuss it without an invitation from the host. What you're doing is meddling. \n\nUntil the actual host weighs in, nothing you say matters.

I'm not 100% sure why", "Except I put MSG in the turkey gravy.", "Whatever you say, bro", "What? Read it again. I don't understand why people are like \"Hey maybe your wife doesn't like big get togethers!\" Like I somehow didn't figure that out on my own over 10 years of living with her.

She's letting me ask.", "I guess to me it's low stakes because if wife says yes, then aunt says no, nothing has changed, since asking her family would have been the last step in the process and the wife was always invited. They could just not bring it up to her family at all in that case.", "Not really because I didn't appreciate your sarcasm from earlier. You may look around on your own.", "Not really a flex in my opinion since it's not my house.", "I thought about that! My ask tree was as such:\n\n1: Ask wife if we can invite her family\n\n2: ask my aunt if they can come\n\n3: invite her mom\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause what would be the point of asking my aunt first if my wife doesn't let me invite them in the first place? Then I'd have to awkwardly explain to my aunt that I never ended up inviting them because my wife said no.\n\nAlso, I know my aunt well enough. There's always at least a few tag alongs at each Thanksgiving.

Why is it just your wife/her family who has to change their holiday? Sounds like you've already made up your mind and cannot be convinced.", "It's what most of us who have to go to more than one house do!\n\nI think I was like 20 when I figured out I needed to just sample a little of everything at each house if I wanted to not explode.", "Perhaps your wife doesn\u2019t WANT to visit with everyone all at once. Maybe she likes the quiet time with her family without feeling like she needs to be a social butterfly and talk with the other 20 people in the house lest she appear rude.  She may feel too pulled in multiply directions to really meaningfully connect with anyone.", "So you asked her and refused to drop it and now you ask for judgement and refuse to accept any you don\u2019t agree with. Extra asshole points and I\u2019m Thankful to have been happily married for 41 years to a husband who isn\u2019t all about what he wants and damn everyone else\u2019s feelings.", "Lol. Suggestive questioning has the intent of manipulating the subject. Like in a courtroom leading a witness. What could they possibly be trying to manipulate you for here?\n\nLook at the intent of what they are asking you. They want to know if there is some reason you aren't alternating the visits instead of trying to do both in the same day or combining them.", "Sounds like you don't listen to her or consider her wishes at all to be blunt.", "We can tell that you don't understand. \n\nIt's not that your wife doesn't like big get togethers, it's that your wife also likes her small family get together.", "What makes you feel bad for my husband?", "You literally came to a place that's whole basis of existence is to judge another person/situation and are confused when you are getting judged? Are you like....new here or something? Because logically I'm just confused why you're confused op? Make it make sense", "Lol, I stand by my opinion of you. You're just a jerk...you give off little D energy ...I'm sure you'll continue to comment on here cause welp you're petty", "OP hasn't asked his wife to see if they could operate thanksgiving differently he's demanding that she push her family to scrap there celebration to join's families.\n\nHe's also made comments in response to others in this thread he doesn't want to go see her family and said its a wasted effort to even make a turkey with such few people. OP is absolutely TA here.", "Exactly. Things change, and it\u2019s on *both of them* to realize things change. But OPs solution is to do everything he\u2019s been doing since before they even married while his wife and *literally her whole family* change when they celebrate, where they celebrate, and who they celebrate with. OP is trying to get out of the \u201cthings change\u201d aspect and make it have as little impact on him as he can.\n\nHis family dinner is at 2pm, and hers is \u201cat a normal dinner time or even later\u201d according to OP. So having dinner with his family then leaving to go to hers is a pretty good solution that involves traditions changing for *both of them*. Alternating years would also be a good solution that involves traditions changing for *both of them.* But OP (and you, it seems) is against that change being equal, he just wants the option that results in him changing as little as possible. All while ignoring his wife saying that her family wouldn\u2019t like that, even though she knows them better than he does.", "There ya go. It sounds like she really just wants some quiet time with her family, and they do too.", "Bingo.", "I stand corrected Reggie. I took \"asking wife\" as asking her family. You're right on this one :) I was thinking more of asking her family and lastly aunt which could be unfortunate.", "Yep, you're entitled af. Wonder how she even married you.

Let her know aunt welcomes them.\n3. Ask in-laws.\n\nThere doesn't have to be awkwardness. If they decide not to come just say it didn't work out, fit their schedule or they made other plans. There is literally no reason in the world you would have to \" awkwardly explain to my aunt that I never ended up inviting them because my wife said no\". I mean why would that even be floating around in your mind? Unless you want to humiliate, embarrass or penalize your wife for refusing, you don't need to volunteer that piece, like at all.\n\nI think there might be a doubt in your wife's mind about whether you aunt would welcome 3 additional guests. Fifteen is a lot of people for a sit down dinner and even though stragglers come off and on, your in-laws don't fall into that category.\n\nThis whole conversation begs the question of why you are trying to interfere with your in-laws family traditions simply to make things easier on yourself. These are older, settled people with their own traditions.", "I also want to keep hanging out with my family. They're actually pretty cool people.", "I'm just asking for feedback. It's up to me what I do with that feedback. That's how this all works.", "What part of that suggested to you that I cared to discuss this topic any further?

Just look around.", "I'm like 99% sure he'd actually prefer it if you did like getting together with his family.
