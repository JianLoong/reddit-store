Well, the carpool left me behind. There is no bus stop close to the venue and the cost of an uber home was too high. So my options were, find someone else or walk 30 min to the nearest motel for a cheap night and walk another 30 min in the morning. Buses were closing in 30 min. So finding someone to drive me to a bus stop in time was slipping and impossible for someone else to drive me home.\n\nA coworker(24F) offered me her couch to sleep in. She needed a driver as she was drunk. I accepted, drove her home and I slept the night there. Next morning she made us breakfast and drove me home.
