You and your brother are so close in age I'd say you should be fine sharing. Her, not so much. If they couldn't afford a place that has enough room for everyone, maybe they should've chosen a cheaper destination/shorter vacation. \n\nYou're NTA for not wanting to share with anyone, although your alternative suggestion is not very good either. But the insufficient sleeping arrangements are not your fault. One question though: were they known to you before you left for this vacation?
