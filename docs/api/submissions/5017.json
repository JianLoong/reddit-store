You and your brother are so close in age I'd say you should be fine sharing. Her, not so much. If they couldn't afford a place that has enough room for everyone, maybe they should've chosen a cheaper destination/shorter vacation. \n\nYou're NTA for not wanting to share with anyone, although your alternative suggestion is not very good either. But the insufficient sleeping arrangements are not your fault. One question though: were they known to you before you left for this vacation?

One shower every four days is somewhat less than the norm.\n\nWhat I really want to know is whether your sister's hygiene has always been this poor, or was there a fairly sudden change in the last couple of years?\n\nEdit: NTA, by the way.

Is the lack of showering really noticable, or is it just the idea that squicks you out?\n\nYou don't need to shower daily, though it depends on your needs.

They are the two people who wouldn't take the value of a bedroom and are an imposition on everyone else. You need to tell your mother that she's an adult here and she needs to do the right thing.

OP, I\u2019m sure that you fart in your sleep too. \n\nThe showering is another thing though. It\u2019s common to not wash hair every day for women but asking for a daily shower isn\u2019t unreasonable.
