Basically I never lived up to There Audrey\u2019s name and it honestly makes me hate my name which is a shame because it's a pretty name and I wish I could like it but I can't. \n\nSo about 4 years ago I started going by AJ (my first and middle initial) instead of Audrey I told everyone (friends, teachers, my siblings and parents, even my grandparents) to call me AJ pretty much everyone started calling me AJ except my grandparents. I guess my grandparents finally started to realize EVERYONE calls me AJ except them. So they started asking why I didn't want to go by Audrey anymore so I finally told them because you constantly compared me to your guys Audrey made me hate my own name. They got mad saying they just wanted me to make Audrey proud since she wasn't able to fulfill a long life. they haven't talked to me since because I'm acting like an immature brat and even said to my mom \u201cYou know your sister Audrey wouldn't act like that\u201d.
