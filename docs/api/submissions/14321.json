{"id": 14321, "submission_id": "12g21dx", "title": "AITA for saying my little sister\u2019s travel routine is excessive?", "selftext": "PLEASE READ THE EDIT AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS POST. I (30m) have a younger sister, \u201cAnn\u201d (27F). My sister has a job that often involves travel. She\u2019s always loved travelling and has been going on solo travel trips since she was 18 so this suits her well. \n\nWe were having our monthly dinner at our parents\u2019 house when all of a sudden her phone rang and she said it was related to work and had to take it. When she came back I asked her if everything is ok and she told me that everything was fine and she had just been trying to get her first floor hotel room switched to a second or third floor room for about a week since she didn\u2019t make the booking herself. I asked her why it mattered since she would only be staying in the room for 1 night. She told me that as a woman traveling alone to a town she\u2019s never been to, she doesn\u2019t feel safe staying in a first floor room and tries to avoid it where possible. I told her I didn\u2019t understand why. She told me that there are several things she has to do as a woman travelling alone specifically because she\u2019s a woman traveling alone. \n\nI asked her to explain and she began listing things she does like doing a check over of her room before she closes the door, checking the mirrors and drawing the blinds immediately, never using the room occupancy cards provided by the establishment. Keeping her keys on the door during the night and either ordering room service, eating dinner beforehand or bringing it with her so that she doesn\u2019t have to leave her room. There\u2019s more but the strangest part to me was that she says on trips of multiple days where she knows she\u2019s likely going to have to interact with people either at the hotel or people who aren\u2019t related to her work, she always has a pre-prepared story about who she is and why she\u2019s there that is never true and in this story she always mentions she has an older brother. I told her I understand wanting to feel safe but I felt that was a little excessive. We discussed it and she called me an asshole. \n\nI\u2019ve brought it up to friends who agree with me but my gf and her sister say that I\u2019m looking at it through the lens of privilege and haven\u2019t even tried to understand. My parents are trying to stay out of it but I get the impression they agree with her. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thanks to helpful links provided by commenters and DMs, I have revised my position and concluded I am TA. I will be contacting the mods to ask to lock this post so that those helpful links and advice can stay up, but failing that I will be deleting this post and apologizing to my sister and my gf and my gf\u2019s sister.

Even though it's the same behavior (locking the door), it can be overboard for one person and very necessary for another.", ">I don\u2019t see why gender has to play into it at all\n\nBecause 1 in 6 women are rape or assaulted in the US every year.  I just checked RAINN for current statistics - for men it is 1 in 33.\n\nSo women are FIVE TIMES more likely to be victims of sexual violence ... and you don't see how gender plays into it?\n\nWhat rock have you been living under your whole life?\n\nETA - fixed typo", "I am struggling to comprehend how you even have a gf when you are this patronising, arrogant and ignorant. What are your good points?", "Two major factors that put women at a disadvantage and more vulnerable to crime.\n\nFirst of all, criminals go after soft targets.  That means the isolated house on the corner when the owners are out of town, the tourist on the subway talking loudly with his friends with his wallet halfway out his back pocket, or the woman traveling alone whom you can easily overpower.  \n\nSecondly,  there's a whole subset of criminals who only target women.  Namely, people interested in sex/rape, or sexual trafficking. \n\nCriminals are always on the lookout for soft targets.  They could be hotel staff who case guests for their friends, people frequenting nearby restaurants, or watching through comings and goings of people in the hotel.  Best practice is to minimize one's chances of getting noticed by simply staying in your room as much as possible and minimizing your movement.  The fewer people that notice there's a single woman staying in room 203 for a week, the better.   \n\nFirst floor hotel is an obvious non-starter.  Direct access from the outside through the window,  straight sight lines into the room.  2nd floor is much safer.", "Globally, 6+ women are murdered by a man every single hour of every single day.\n\nNot a single woman makes it through their lives without having experienced sexual assault, harassment, and/or discrimination.\n\nIn the event that women *are* harmed, even if they took precautions, they are almost always likely to be blamed for not taking even more precautions.\n\nWomen are often not believed and therefore not protected.  The prosecution rates for man-on-woman crimes are abysmally low in every country.\n\nTraveling women are often identified as particularly vulnerable because they don't know their surroundings, they don't have a safe place to go to, and they are unlikely to have many people around to recognize and/or protect them.\n\nThis reality extends into every single woman's day-to-day life, traveling or not.  This should honestly not be a surprise or shock to you given that it is demonstrated all around us all the time.  Your ignorance is willful, and that makes you a major asshole.", "I just looked her up. How horrible! I know there was a woman recently murdered in her Airbnb in Costa Rica too, by a security guard at the condo complex she was renting at. Lots of examples of why women need to take more precautions.", "And yet you feel confident enough about the matter to make judgement calls on it.", "Oh you already made it clear you dont know anything in your other responses to me. Maybe do some research before speaking on shit you know nothing about.", "And yet, you somehow thought you knew more than someone with that knowledge? Why? How did you come to believe that you know better than everyone else, despite admitting that you dint even know the basics?", "This post should be recorded for posterity's sake as the best example of how oblivious the average cishet male is to literally anyone else's struggles.", "Wow!!\nNo research is needed to know that women are attacked & assaulted physically & verbally every day.", "OP just said she gets dinner before she gets there so I don\u2019t know if that means she doesn\u2019t check out the restaurants. If I\u2019m travelling alone I get dinner while I\u2019m still out and then when I get in to the hotel for the night I stay in. Which is how I took it. Clearly if she\u2019s staying multiple nights places she\u2019s eating somewhere.\n\nBut even if she\u2019s just grabbing McDonalds and heading to the hotel, that\u2019s her business and hers alone.", "YES!!! that\u2019s quite literally the point everyone is trying to make!!! you\u2019re so blinded by the fact that it wouldn\u2019t happen to YOU that you can\u2019t even listen to the women in your life and a ton of strangers on the internet that are all telling you the same thing.\n\nand p.s. your friends that are on your side are also wrong", "Like I said you're speaking from a place of ignorance and pretending its knowledge.\n\nDo you even know who Brock Turner is without googling? how ignorant of the world that women live in are you?", "Yes dude yes they do they kill them or they rape them, they don't like hearing no", "Yes, yes they will.  r/whenwomenrefuse", "Oh buddy you are lucky to have lived such a sheltered life.", "Yeah, men really do that. Girls start getting sexually harassed around age 11-12, right around puberty.

I mean damn I've heard of oblivious men, but you sir are on another level. \n\nMet a woman in a concealed carry course.  She told me the reason why she was there.

She told me a group of her friends were talking about going to a great show ( long time ago don't remember which one). After making plans and saving the money to go, most cancelled. She was upset, I said if it was me I'd go by myself. Her response will stick with me forever. \"Yeah if I was a 6foot 5 300lbs guy I'd go by myself too. \" At that moment I realized everyone isn't me. I don't worry about people wanting to harm me, if they try I'm more than able to defend my self ( boxed golden gloves, and studied a few martial arts). She is like 5 foot 3 100lbs soaking wet. I truly never thought about a women's safety plan before she said it to me. Now when ever I'm with a group with women in it I always offer to walk them to their cars at the end of the night. Sometimes as men we don't full thing about how women look at things differently because there are some sick people in the world.", "Before my first date with my boyfriend, he invited me to come to his house. I'd been watching a lot of Criminal Minds lately, so I told him I'd much rather have a pubic date and he was fine with it. We had a picnic. I somehow knew before we met that he was a decent guy. And any guy who protests such requests are not decent.", "When I met my boyfriend on a dating app, he said he would like to go on a hike for our first date, I said (half-joking) : \"I hope you are not trying to bring me to an isolated place to murder me.\" He answered: \"No, what about [most crowded, yet pleasant park within city limits, accessible by public transit]\". So I accepted, we've been together ever since. He didn't belittle my hesitancy about going to an isolated place, so I knew he at least found it reasonable that a woman would be safety councious on a first date. Also, this date was in the afternoon, so it was not dark at all.", "That isn't what was said. You are acting in obvious bad faith. I will not be responding you any further and any further engagement from you will be treated as harassment.", "Where I live, when you\u2019re in labor the nurses make an excuse for your partner to leave and ask if you feel safe at home.

Your intent does not mitigate the impact of your actions.", "Make it slightly better by sharing with them what you\u2019ve learned here. It sucks that so many men don\u2019t believe the lived experience of women. None of your friends agreed with you sister. They all have the same blind spot you just had cleared away. It might be awkward but the women in their lives will appreciate it.", "Nice that you finally get it but it took \u201cresources\u201d for you to drop it. Meanwhile you discounted your sister\u2019s lived experience, your gf\u2019s and her sister\u2019s lived experience, and countless women in these comments lived experience.  YTA still. The arrogance. \n\nEven if your sister was the only woman on earth experiencing this, your refusal to acknowledge it *because it never happened to you* is the height of privilege.

You're **still** the asshole.", "I absolutely *love* that you ignored a post full of women telling you how shit is for us when we travel alone or even just exist and and you refused to listen and only changed your stance after reading resources. YTA still.", "The problem isn\u2019t that you didn\u2019t know, it\u2019s that you knew nothing and assumed you knew better than women who have experience in the situation and then you belittled and dismissed their experience.

You went straight to insulting her and minimizing what her and other women go through because you, as a man, haven't experienced the same thing and obviously, she's just hysterical. you're misogynistic and you need to explore that part of you to rectify it.", "Bro, what? You posted on Reddit instead of doing a cursory Google search on statistics of crimes against women when traveling alone, or see how many blogs and articles that are just lists of stuff WOMEN have to do as a safety precaution. \n\nThis is what it is meant by expecting other people to do the emotional labor of educating you. You didn\u2019t take your sister\u2019s continued anger and silence, as well as your gf\u2019s anger, as maybe something you should look into more. You literally asked Reddit to do it for you. \n\nSo since you\u2019re in such \u201clearning\u201d state right now, I will also concur and advise you to look into emotional labor, and why that shit is grating to women and a detriment to an equal partnership, romantic or platonic.", "Maybe try researching things you know nothing about BEFORE opening your uneducated mouth  in future. You acted you like you knew it all and you sure as hell weren\u2019t making any effort to educate yourself, you just assumed you must be right.

None of us can completely understand issues that may be exclusive to certain genders, races, or sexual orientations. \n\nWhat IS an issue is trying to dictate or judge how those people should feel about those experiences when we've never had to experience them ourselves. That is what the comments are trying to tell you. It's OK not to know how that person feels but the best responses are usually \"That sucks, I didn't know you had to deal with that. Tell me more.\" not to be dismissive simply because you can't relate.\n\nNone of us is an authority on an experience we don't have.
