I wouldn't say anything, I would just do this way over dramatic, loud gasp, then one hand over my mouth and the other pointing at them with a shaking finger. Eventually they got it and started making the family favorites, some with onions and often, without any prompting, a separate little one dish of the same without onions, just for me.

She made it *EVERY* holiday. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAt any rate, I second the idea of getting your butt over to their house a few times and see what\u2019s up. \n\nOr, just drop the whole thing. Cook as usual, and package the leftovers for your son and grandchild.", "NTA. \n\nIf she can\u2019t be a big girl and eat (or at the very least use her words and tell ya\u2019ll what kind of food she DOES eat) then by all means, order pizza. \n\nI am also a mildy picky eater (vegetarian and I hate mushrooms) but I\u2019m also a grown ass adult and can communicate so people know what I will and will not eat.", "Is she expecting you to make her food?  Maybe she doesn\u2019t even want any and doesn\u2019t want to be rude.  I would just give her a plate and say \u201ctake however much you want if you\u2019re hungry\u201d so she\u2019s not wasting food.", "Nta, but also don't take it personal if you can help it. She might have an eating disorder or be uncomfortable eating food made by others. Either way it doesn't sound like you're the issue :)", "NTA for you, and a very light YTA for them, but only for refusing good communication on the subject: You could try a dinner with a little of everything, tapas style! That way she can get just what she wants and can try something new without a big serving being made. FAR less pressure on her and you could learn if she really does like anything and make dinners around those. Add some things she hasn't tried, is there anything new YOU may want to try to make from your culture or not? You could put more sauces/spices on the side than in the dish so she can tailor it and maybe leave out something she doesn't like or have less in it. Not all the time, but to find out what will work for her. Could it be a bonding experience if you were BOTH to cook something that she likes together as MIL and DIL? Differing textures not just flavors of food as that is usually the biggest problem (mayo/sour cream like textures cause me an hour of vomiting, literally). Otherwise just keep on cooking for your son's sake, it seems to mean a lot to him and his GF seems relatively neutral. \n\nJust make it clear that you don't take offense with her not eating and you are not mad at all. You are just concerned and want to be the best and closest MIL you can be and food is a part of that for you. You also want her to be a part of that since you love her so much you just want them to both be happy, welcomed and feel like you can participate in everything. But also make sure to say that in the end you love her and that's never gonna change because of some food conflicts, so no added pressure. Food is a trickier subject than most realize, not adding pressure is important.\n\nCan I ask what culture of cooking? (yes it's helpful to know) She could have Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) that would literally cause severe nausea. Her's might be specifically restrictive in ways it doesn't really work with much of your culture's cooking (at least what she has tried) and she doesn't want to be ruder. Instead she would rather not make a big fuss. This is all POSSIBLE, but of course I have no way of knowing from this side of a keyboard... and I'm a borderline hypochondriac with a family full of doctors, so I have my biases lol", "NAH you don't have to cook for them, but I don't think it's fair to be that upset over this. Your DIL might have anxiety about eating. It could be an eating disorder, anxiety disorder, or something else similar to that. She also might just really not like your cooking. She can't force herself to enjoy it. You're not obligated to cook for them.\n\nWhy doesn't your son have home cooked meals often?", "INFO: How would you react if they told you that she just doesn\u2019t like your cooking? Truthfully speaking, is it a reaction that they would be afraid of? It\u2019s possible that they\u2019re trying to protect your feelings by using the picky eater excuse as a coverup, since it\u2019s a very sensitive topic.\n\nHow come your son rarely gets homemade meals? Does he not know how to cook anything?", "Cook for your son and she can do take out with her own money. I wouldn\u2019t care about her not eating that\u2019s her choice. I don\u2019t always eat what my mil cooks, I sometimes buy food outside because I like what she made and my husband eats her very spicy yummy cooked food.I think it will be nice that you don\u2019t modify anything for her because end of the day it will be napkin on food so might as well cook what your son likes.", "I feel bad for your son, nothing on earth like moms cooking and now he has to miss out. NTA though.", "NTA. She\u2019s allowed to be a picky eater, but it\u2019s not fair to you to expect a home cooked meal when you have to watch it be turned down that way every time. If I had a family member who reacted that way EVERY time I cooked, I\u2019d probably stop cooking for them too. What a blow to your confidence, I\u2019m sorry!", "I think the most important question is, is your grandchild deigned the culture from your side of the family. Does her behavior go beyond her aversion to your culture's food? To me it seems she is making your grandchild view half of his culture in a negative way. \n\nNTA, she should show some respect to the host and the effort put into making a meal for her. \n\nIf they can't be honest about her issue I have to believe it is because your son knows how offensive the truth is. Tell them they are not welcome in your home until they can be honest about her food issues in your home.", "Nope. NTA. If he wants home cooked meals he can cook for himself.

If not, invite yourself - there's no reason why it should always be parents cooking.\n\n- You say they have a kid together; does your grand-child eat your food, or do you feel like she's trying to put them off it?\n\n- Do they have a good relationship? Could your son be pressuring her to say she's just being picky because he feels you would get upset if she told you she doesn't really like your food?\n\n- Do you have other issues with her?", "INFO: if your son came to visit alone, would you cook for him? I don\u2019t think you are T A H, but you could cook for yourself and your son and not worry about the GF. If she doesn\u2019t want to eat what you make, she can eat after she leaves.

Provide good food, either pizza or something your son had suggested, and then she either eats or she doesn\u2019t. She won\u2019t starve from skipping one meal, and it\u2019s probably not about you at all. Respect her privacy on the subject.", "Is she upset that she is unable to eat your food? Just because someone is at your home doesn't mean they need to eat what you prepare. If she isn't pitching a fit, why isn't it enough to just cook for your son and yourself? Maybe she doesn't eat from other peoples' kitchens but doesn't want to tell you that.", "NTA for ordering pizza but it just sounds like she's got issues, not that she hates your food.  I have an anxiety disorder that often has me acting like this.  I know it drives every one nuts and they hate it but the alternative is me spending the whole dinner loudly vomiting in the bathroom.  I forced myself to eat Thanksgiving this year for everyone else's sake and managed to keep it down there but spent the next two nights locked to the toilet.

I have SPD and ARFID and it's always been so embarrassing going to peoples houses to eat. My mom raised me to be polite though so I've literally FORCED myself to eat someone's food to be polite (my first boyfriends mom at 15yo). I've literally got a free salad with my meal at a restaurant and tried to force myself to eat it because it smells good but soon as it's in my mouth I'm gagging. It's really upsetting because I don't want to be like this but it's been an issue for 30 years of my life now.\nJust saying please don't make a big issue about it. It's just food, who cares what she eats if she eats. Ask her if she would prefer to bring her own comfort/safe food for dinner instead. There is clearly an issue here.

You don\u2019t have to cook something nice because they\u2019re coming over but you also don\u2019t have to order a pizza just to prove a point.

Men can cook too, I know this as an over 50M who is heading back into the kitchen to finish turning the turkey bones into hearty soup.

She fussed a little for 30 seconds and then had a big smile on her face as I raved about how good it was. OP should teach her son how to make his favorite meals.  However, I think it\u2019s also a compliment that he wants her meals so badly.\n\nMy mother in law has an eating disorder so her home is always completely empty of actual food and she drinks her calories. When she does eat everything upsets her stomach and she either barfs or complains.  I nearly fainted once as a young person too shy to speak up that she didn\u2019t have any food to serve her guests. At this point I bring groceries, invade her kitchen and cook meals for my family.  She can join us or not, I don\u2019t really care at this point.  Her narcoses are her problem and if she wants us (normal humans who eat food) to visit we need to have a place to make the food we consume.

I don't want to discuss how \"just a little\" chili powder is waaay too spicy and that I don't think it's too bland without black pepper. No, I don't find the smell of your bacon tempting. It doesn't even smell like food to me. I'm very happy with my bran flakes or overcooked broccoli.  I understand that you've made the food correctly and 99% of people will love it. I know I'm weird.

Took me a long time to trust them.", "I mean, even people without disorders can't help when they like and don't like and shouldn't be forced to eat something they don't like just to please others. Just don't go out to eat with them then.", "this is\u2026 really weird.", "> If they are refusing the food I worked all day to perfect, I will be offended and not invite them back.\n\nThen don't work all day to perfect the food?", "I bet OP\u2019s DIL is trying so hard to be normal, while embarrassed about her condition, bc of ppl like you and OP. You and OP need to get over your little fee fees, someone not liking your food is not an insult. Ppl are allowed to not like things. Get over yourself.", "Ppl don\u2019t HAVE to like things. \n\nAnd keeping ppl with eating disorders from eating with others, will only further make their eating disorder worse. Jesus Christ have some compassion. Eating disorders are quite literally life and death, someone not liking your food isn\u2019t."]}
